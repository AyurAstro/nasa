[UPDATE (Jun 25, 2023): We are concluding the data collection, not because it was not successful, but because there is TOO much data! Thousands of data points per topic have already been collected, and as a proof of concept, we think the project has to be deemed a success. With your own topic, you can customize the code files to your purpose. Feel free to reach out if you need assistance.]





Collection daily from May 14, 2023 onwards. Consult the csv files above to access and download the data relevant to your topic of interest. Some 60+ new events on average are added per topic *daily*.

To get all the data all at once through this page, click on the green code button above and then choose "Download Zip." Unzip the file and then go into the resulting folder, open the "data" folder, and open the appropriate .csv file for viewing and editing via your favorite spreadsheet software.

Currently we are considering the following topics only in English and from Google News only:
- 'accident',
- 'birth',
- 'explosion',
- 'fire',
- 'game',
- 'political assassination',
- 'political coup',
- 'religious miracle',
- 'shooting',
- 'suicide',
- 'volcano eruption'
- 'wedding'.

We are open to collecting data for your project. Suggest new topics and languages, *etc.*, [here](https://www.ayurastro.com/contact.html#/).
