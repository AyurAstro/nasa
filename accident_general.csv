To tell the story of its accidental origin, you need to know why it's special in the first place. Ice wine, often written as one word ('icewine') in Canada, and known as 'eiswein' in its native land of Germany, is wine pressed from frozen grapes.  The flavor of grape juice comes from the various sugars, acids, and aromatic compounds it contains, but a majority of the juice (roughly 70-80%) is plain old water. When grapes are left on the vine in the winter snow, that water freezes and the flavorful compounds separate. Thus, when the grapes are finally juiced, the water content is far lower than usual, resulting in juice that is more like extremely concentrated grape syrup. After the mixture is fermented for a few months, you're left with one of the sweetest and most flavorful wines in existence. The results are rather magical, and it's all thanks to the ingenuity of German vintners, who adapted to sudden harsh conditions.  Ice "

The latest on the investigation and the injuries tonight on channel 9 eyewitness news at five. pic.twitter.com/0VNvjnyL8V — Dave Faherty (@FahertyWSOC9) May 15, 2023  NC Wildlife said the crash happened Sunday at the Riverbend Boat Landing on Eddie Nichols Drive shortly before 6:30 p.m.  The people on the Sea-Doos did not know each other, investigators said, and they don’t think drugs or alcohol were involved.  All five patients were taken to the hospital with injuries that varied from minor to severe. Investigators say there were two adults on one Sea-Doo and three juveniles on the other.  The Lucia-Riverbend Fire Department told Channel 9′s Dave Faherty they have already responded to four accidents on the lake over the last four weeks, including one drowning.  “When they’re out there riding, they’re riding erratically. And I say with due disregard, they’re just not really paying attention,” Fire Chief David Toomey said. “They’re just trying to have a good time and I understand that.”  The wreck comes one week after Willie Gray heard an out of control personal watercraft strike his dock at the home he’s lived in for more than 30 years.  “As you can see right now, it’s very calm, but on the weekends it gets crazy here,” Gray said. “And it’s still early in the season.”  Crews are urging people to make sure they use the kill switch on their personal watercraft and wear a flotation device when on the water. It’s something Tomas Suska knows all too well. He said five years ago, he was on a jet ski when he was struck and had to go to the hospital afterwards.  “Just got in a T-bone accident and didn’t have time to react. The guy was broken in two different places, so you just got to be very careful,” he said.  Faherty asked NC Wildlife about possible charges in the Sea-Doo crash they said the case remains under investigation.  This is a developing story, check back at wsoctv.com for updates.

(KMIZ)  A Cole County ATV crash left four kids in a Columbia hospital Sunday morning. Another man was seriously injured in Cooper County after an ATV crash Saturday. Two other reports of ATV crashes were recorded in the past week from Moniteau County and Randolph County.  An increase in off-road riders starts anytime temperatures rise, Cpl. Kyle Green with the Missouri State Highway Patrol said. But the chance of getting into an accident also grows.  “They're not toys at all,” Green added. “But that's the way many people view them.”  Last year alone, the Missouri State Highway Patrol recorded 284 total ATV crashes in the state. Over 70% of those resulted in injuries and 23 of those crashes were fatal. In many cases, Green said safety devices in the vehicle weren’t being used if they had them.  “That's unfortunately where we get many of these serious crashes,” Green said. “Where people aren't wearing helmets or they're not wearing the seatbelts and they get thrown out into the woods.”  At the same time, all-terrain vehicle crashes present a different problem for first responders. Cole County EMS said Sunday’s crash was in a remote location.  “ATVs present a little bit more of an operational issue for us,” Eric Hoy the Chief of Emergency Medical Services said. “We think there was a delay in activating 911 because they were in such a rural area that they had to get somewhere where they could actually call.”  Additionally, ambulances were not able to reach the scene alone. The EMS Incident Commander requested mutual aid for all-terrain transport vehicles from the Cole County Emergency Response Team, the Jefferson City Fire Department and Osage Ambulance District.  “It really limits the capabilities of the first responders,” Green said. “If you're going to be out on property that's in a hard-to-reach spot, hard to locate, then you need to let somebody know… in case something happens, at least we have an idea where to start searching.”  Driving an all-terrain vehicle impaired is just that too- impaired driving. In 2022, the Missouri State Highway Patrol recorded 50 ATV accidents caused by drinking or drugs.  “Operating these while impaired is dangerous for not only them but for the other people that are out on the roadways,” Green added.  In Missouri, there’s no set age to drive an all-terrain vehicle. While children under 18 must legally wear a helmet, they can drive freely on private property. In the same way, the Missouri State Highway Patrol warns it’s the parent’s responsibility to make sure the kid is ready “mentally and physically” to drive an ATV.  Wearing a helmet and seatbelt, if the vehicle has one, can decrease the chances of being injured in an ATV or UTV crash Green said. Letting someone know where you’re headed and having a way to contact 911 if needed can help emergency services get to you more quickly if needed.  Driving an ATV with the same mentality as driving a vehicle could help avoid an accident completely.  “Just be sure to take extra caution just like you would in your vehicle,” Hoy added.  Drivers can find more on ATV or UTV rules and regulations for Missouri here."
