The demonstrators had gathered at the Pastoral Hotel in Kfar Blum, a kibbutz in the Upper Galilee panhandle, to protest Barkat’s appearance there for a conference along with representatives from the Kohelet Policy Forum, the conservative think tank advocating for the proposed changes to the legal system.  After Barkat and his entourage arrived at the hotel, the activists entered a hall during the former Jerusalem mayor’s meeting with a group of mayors and clashes broke out.  Video of the incident shows the demonstrators shouting at security and hotel staff followed by pushing and shoving, people falling, chairs being thrown and flag poles being used as weapons.

The next political assassination is a matter of time,” sources close to Barkat said.  The hotel responded to the incident: “The hotel employees were preparing this morning for the arrival of Minister Nir Barkat at the conference when a group of protesters broke into the conference hall. The meeting with the protesters quickly flared up when the hotel employees felt threatened and reacted to the situation.  “The hotel is shocked by the incident, condemns violence of any kind and views with severity the incident and the violence of the employees involved. The police were called to the scene. The hotel will conduct a full investigation and cooperate with the police investigation to clarify the circumstances of the case until justice has been fully served for all those involved in the matter.”  Last month, two suspects were arrested in Tel Aviv, as anti-government protesters attacked Barkat.  Levin’s threat  Meanwhile, Justice Minister Yariv Levin is threatening to quit the government unless at least one law is enacted from the proposed legal reform program, Channel 12 reported on Sunday. He is reportedly demanding that the law be passed by the end of the Knesset summer session, after the approval of the state budget.  Israel’s parliament adjourns at the end of July and, according to the report, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wants to finish the session without bringing the stalled legal bills for a vote in the plenum. That would put Netanyahu and Levin at loggerheads.  Levin’s threat comes as President Isaac Herzog continues to work on a compromise on judicial reform and as the protests against it, briefly disrupted by the Gaza conflict last week, continue."

Protests against the decision to release him are also planned in Islamabad  Lahore (Pakistan) (AFP) – Several thousand pro-government protesters demanded Monday the resignation of Pakistan's top judge for releasing Imran Khan from arrest last week, as the former prime minister went back to court facing yet more legal cases.  Advertising Read more  Khan, who was ousted from power in April last year, was arrested on corruption charges on Tuesday following months of simmering political crisis, prompting his voters to rampage through cities.  His arrest was declared unlawful by the Supreme Court's chief justice and Khan was later released and granted various protective bail applications.  ""The chief justice and a few of his cronies are disgracing the judiciary like never before. Their justice seems to be serving one leader only,"" said Malik Hassam Mehmood, a 36-year-old trader and supporter of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's party.  ""We are here to protest for the rule of law and a non-partisan judiciary.""  There was a heavy security presence in the capital on Monday as protesters gathered outside the court in the capital's so-called red zone.  The Supreme Court order said Khan's arrest last week as he arrived at the Islamabad High Court to file a bail application in the graft case ""violated the petitioner's right of access to justice"".  However, referring to the pro-government protesters, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah said on Sunday that ""people want to come in very large numbers because of a deep sense of anger and anguish"".  Analysts say legal hurdles are often used to discourage dissent in Pakistan and Khan dismisses the cases arrayed against him as politically motivated.  Political analyst Mosharraf Zaidi said judges were split down the middle over the political crisis.  ""The judiciary still makes compromises with both civilians and the military, but on many issues judges have repeatedly demonstrated the ability to take a stand and hold their ground,"" he told AFP.  Tussle with military  Former international cricket star Khan returned to the Lahore High Court on Monday, where his lawyers said they were seeking information on fresh cases linking him to the violence that followed his arrest. The case will continue Tuesday.  Khan was accompanied by his wife, Bushra Bibi, who was granted protective bail in the same corruption case that led to the former leader's arrest.  Their team erected a white curtain between their vehicle and the courtroom to shield the couple from the media.  At least nine people were killed, hundreds of police officers injured and more than 7,000 people detained in last week's unrest before Khan was released on bail on Friday, authorities said.  Sanaullah, who has vowed Khan will be rearrested, told reporters on Sunday the ""terrorism and mobbing was all preplanned and this was done by Khan"".  Elections are due no later than October and Khan has held a series of vastly popular marches challenging the authority of the shaky coalition of parties that replaced him.  He has also waged an unprecedented campaign of defiance against Pakistan's army, which has ruled for nearly half of Pakistan's 75-year history and continues to wield massive influence.  When Khan surged into office in 2018, most understood it was with the backing of the generals. Analysts likewise said when he left power it was because he had fallen out of favour with the top brass.  In opposition Khan has made explosive claims about the military's involvement in politics, including that they plotted a November assassination attempt in which he was shot in the leg while campaigning for fresh polls.  His arrest last Tuesday came just hours after he repeated the allegations at a rally.  © 2023 AFP"

Heretofore, that commission had been composed entirely of cardinals. The move complements a similar change Francis made in his new constitution for the Roman Curia last year, which decreed that a lay person, man or woman, can head a curial department. (The Roman Curia assists the pope in governing the universal church, while the Vatican City State administers the pope’s physical territory.)  In that sense, the new fundamental law, which replaces one issued by Pope John Paul II in 2000, is indeed a watershed for the lay role. In this case, however, it’s probably one which should also come with a warning.  As opposed to the Roman Curia, it’s hardly a novelty for laity to have a share in governing the pope’s physical territory. During the era of the Papal States, when popes ruled over a swath of central Italy as a temporal monarch, the head of government nominally was always the Cardinal Secretary of State, but the pope generally would appoint a Minister of the Interior who actually called the shots.  Over the years, sometimes that role was played by a cleric, but often it was a layman.  (As a footnote, it’s often said, erroneously, that popes lost their temporal powers in 1870 with the collapse of the Papal States amid Italian unification. Not so – what popes lost was territory, not power. With regard to the Vatican City State, the pope retains absolute civil authority to this day. Just to make sure no one misses the point, the new fundamental law specifies that the pope possesses “the fullness of the power of governance” as the “sovereign,” including “legislative, executive and judicial power.”)  That background brings us to the tale of the last layperson to exercise civil authority in the name of the pope: Pellegrino Rossi, who fate perhaps should serve as a cautionary tale for whoever his successors may be under Francis’s new scheme.  Born in Tuscany in 1787, Rossi studied law in Pisa and Bologna and became a celebrated professor and political thinker. After periods in Switzerland and France, he ended up as the personal envoy of King Louis Philippe I to the Papal States. After the king abdicated in February 1848, Rossi remained in Rome, and eventually was named the interior minister of the new pontiff Pope Pius IX in September of the same year.  By the time of Rossi’s appointment, revolutionary energies were stirring in Rome. Rossi was a federalist, meaning he believed in a federation of independent states on the Italian peninsula, including the full sovereignty of the Papal States, as opposed to the press for national unification then beginning to gather steam.  Although Rossi began efforts to modernize the pope’s civil administration, including plans for new railway miles and telegraph lines, it wasn’t enough for the revolutionaries, who were still seething over Pius IX’s famous allocution Non Semel, in which he made clear he would not join to military push to drive Austria out of northern Italy on the grounds that a pope could not go to war against a Catholic power.  Thus when Rossi arrived at Rome’s Piazza della Cancelleria at around 1:00 p.m. on November 15, 1848, for the opening of a session of the Chamber of Deputies in the Papal States, an assassin was waiting. As Rossi ascended the steps, a man emerged from the crowd and plunged a dagger into his throat. Eyewitness testimony was confused, as some said the assailant was wearing the uniform of a soldier, others that he was dressed as a parliamentarian. In any event, in chaos that followed, the killer was able to disappear.  Rossi staggered for a few steps, then fell to the ground dead.  His assassination set in motion a series of events which led to Pope Pius IX fleeing Rome to take refuge in Gaeta, a seaside town about 100 miles south, which at the time was part of the Bourbon Kingdom of Two Sicilies and a staunch ally of the papacy. Meanwhile in Rome a new revolutionary republic under Giuseppe Mazzini was declared, which would endure until the short-lived restoration of the pope’s secular authority in 1850.  By all accounts, Rossi was a gentle, urbane man of culture. Camillo Benso, the Count of Cavour, described Rossi in one of his letters as “the wittiest man in Italy, the most flexible genius of the age, perhaps the most practical mind in the universe.”  The great likelihood is that Rossi’s assassin had no real beef with him, but killed him as a blow against the pope he served.  Of course, it’s deeply improbable that restless denizens of the 108 acre territory the pope has left today would ever rise against one of his ministers in quite so violent a fashion. Knives in the back in the Vatican these days tend to be metaphorical, not literal.  Nevertheless, there’s still a sobering moral to this story: Anyone who wields authority in the name of the pope needs to know that sometimes, people upset with the pontiff may turn on you as a softer target.  In that light, perhaps the first lay person to sit on the new-fangled governing commission of the Vatican City State ought to make a trek to Rome’s Basilica of San Lorenzo in Damaso, where Rossi is entombed, and spend a moment in quiet prayer.  Uneasy, indeed, lies the head that wears even a share of the crown … whether that head, as it turns out, be clerical or lay."

This violent response by the public is a result of the escalating wave of violence perpetrated by armed gangs in the country.  According to local residents cited by Le Nouvelliste, on Friday, two suspected bandits were killed by members of the population while attempting to hijack a cargo truck on the road to Nazón. The suspects were armed, and the residents took matters into their own hands to protect themselves.  On Saturday, police authorities arrested four suspected bandits in possession of ammunition and automatic weapons in Gonaives. However, the situation took a gruesome turn when members of the population forcibly took custody of the suspects, subjecting them to stoning before setting them on fire. This represents the first time such an action has occurred in Gonaives since the emergence of the “Bwa kale” movement.  In a separate incident, on Monday, alleged bandit Abouló, a member of the “Nou se revolisyonè” group operating in the Raboto district, was arrested in Biennac. He was apprehended alongside two others, Ady Gaston and Poristène Byron. The police confiscated firearms and cell phones from them. Abouló faces charges of multiple murders and the burning of the city’s courthouse.  The Bwa kale movement has gained momentum in the capital and various provinces of Haiti. Comprised of members of the population, this movement takes matters into its own hands through acts of lynching against suspected bandits. The rise of such vigilantism reflects the frustration and desperation of the people in the face of rampant gang violence in the country."

During the flare-up in fighting that followed the death of imprisoned Palestinian activist Khader Adnan, Israeli airstrikes killed at least 18 Palestinians, while rockets from the Gaza Strip killed two civilians in Israeli-occupied territory.  Negotiations on a truce agreement, said two sources close to mediation efforts conducted by Cairo, were rendered complex due to Israel conducting multiple targeted assassinations, killing several senior members of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad Organization, despite officials in Tel Aviv having previously made pledges to stop the use of targeted assassinations.  At least six members of the Gaza-based organization were killed by the Israeli army in under a week, many of them members of the Islamic Jihad’s senior military council. A seventh official and his aide were also reportedly killed, though the group has yet to officially confirm the additional deaths.  Ten Palestinian civilians were also killed by Israeli airstrikes that were conducted in densely populated areas of the Gaza Strip, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.  Two civilians were killed in Israel by returning fire from the strip, where Al-Quds Brigades, the military arm of Islamic Jihad, said that “the Palestinian resistance launched a concentrated missile strike in two phases towards occupied Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.”    Israel’s prime minister and its national security advisor both thanked Cairo for its efforts to mediate the truce agreement, which came into effect on Saturday night.  But the conflict could be sparked again, said the first source. Israel’s current government — its most right-wing government so far — is subject to the hardline positions of its national security and finance ministers, Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, for whom Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu must work hard to keep close. The right-wing Israeli government wanted to start and end the war without any long-term commitments, said the two sources speaking to Mada Masr on condition of anonymity, and there are limits to the pressure that Cairo is able to exert on the Palestinian factions.  Cairo has been working since May 10 toward reaching a ceasefire between the Israeli occupation forces and factions in the Gaza Strip. The talks, they said, were held with Israeli and Palestinian Islamic Jihad representatives in the Egyptian capital, in Gaza with representatives of Hamas and other political groups based in the besieged strip, and finally, in Israel, with political and security officials.  To establish consensus on a ceasefire, they said, Israel needed to clearly pledge in written form to stop pursuing assassinations and hand over the bodies of any assassinated Palestinian figures. Palestinian factions, meanwhile, were obliged to publicly accept a truce — not just a ceasefire — and to accept Egyptian supervision to neutralize rocket launch capabilities from Gaza.  Egypt had to use “clear” language with Israel about the risks of “playing with fire,” said the first source, who was very close to the mediation efforts, given that Israel moved to expand its targeted assassinations. Egypt also requested that the United States and Europe pressure Israel to respond to mediation efforts, the two sources said.  Cairo “intensively moved at high levels” to avoid an escalation, said the first source, especially given the potential for the exchange of fire to take on regional dimensions.  Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian expressed support for the Palestinian resistance on Friday, announcing that he had made contact with Ismail Haniyeh, head of Hamas’ political bureau in Gaza. Hamas, the main faction operating armed resistance from the Gaza Strip, did not join the exchange of fire that broke out in May.  Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah also said on Friday that Hezbollah is communicating with groups in Gaza, saying, “We are monitoring the situation and its developments and providing assistance, and at any time we feel responsible to take any steps, we will not hesitate to do so.”  Groups in Gaza launched attacks on Israel following the May 2 death of Khader Adnan, a Palestinian activist jailed in Israel who starved to death following 87 days of hunger strike.  Riyad Mansour, Palestine’s permanent representative to the United Nations, called on Tuesday for serious and rapid measures to be taken to protect the Palestinian people and ensure their security, and to end the illegal Israeli colonial occupation and the apartheid regime that have been causing so much human suffering for decades and prevented the achievement of just and lasting peace and security in the region."

Haiti is the only country in the Caribbean or the world that the United Nations and other NGO organizations rank as the place with the most crime and gangs. Last week, the Haitian population along with the police killed and burned more than 20 residents who they said were gang members. Not counting other residents across the country who are killed on the pretext that they are gang members.  After the assassination of the former Haitian President in 2021, the U.S. and Canada were among the countries that ordered sanctions against the Haitian elites who sponsored the gangs despite proof that most of the powerful weapons are from the United States. A year later, the Dominican Republic ordered sanctions on former Prime Minister Claude Joseph for having a deep connection with the gangs. Canada’s Prime Minister even called on Europe and other continents to join his sanctions on powerful Haitian elites.  During the Presidency of former President Moise, crimes and kidnappings were very high. President Moise was criticized for not saying anything at all about high crimes and kidnappings during his administration. Since his assassination by Colombians and Haitian-Americans, crimes and kidnapping continued.  Since the killings of some individuals weeks ago, other residents across the country are not free or safe. There are currently allegations or conspiracy of killing unknown residents who come from another area. If the population catches an unknown resident from another area, there is a 98% chance that the population will kill and burn that resident.  According to several sources, there are many residents who are declared innocent by others who died this way. For now, no one in this country is safe because the population is mixed with armed people going around killing anyone they don’t recognize in an area even when they have no proof.  On Sunday, the Haitian politician Nortreus posted a safety alert publication on his Facebook account on the current crimes and assassinations across the country. He said he will not advise any citizens or investors from African countries to visit Haiti right now because there are many acts of violence and assassinations everywhere in the country.  “My concern on the current situation in Haiti. As a young Haitian politician who has friends and associates across the African continent, I will not advise citizens from African countries or investors to visit Haiti or invest right now because of violence and assassinations. Right now, this country is currently not safe to visit or invest in. Wait until the violence and assassinations go away to visit or invest”, Nortreus said on what is currently happening in Haiti in order to save lives.  According to several other reports, among the dead individuals from past weeks to today, there are several innocent residents who died along with the ones that the population and police classified as gang members due to fraudulent identity. Right now, no one is safe and any foreigners can get killed and burned."

Israel, like other states, is bound to international law. Some of its obligations are due to treaties, but there is also customary IHL -- generally accepted practices by states, who treat the practice as if it were law. Israel has adopted the Geneva Conventions, save for the Additional Protocols, but the High Court of Justice sees them as customary law. This shows how important the repeated practices of other states are in IHL.  Targeted killings are a somewhat ill-defined term. There is no set definition under International Humanitarian Law (IHL). Some sources treat it as merely a softer term than assassination, still others describe it as a military strike against a specific person -- in particular that of terrorists.  The International Committee of the Red Cross says that targeted killing is ""The intentional and premeditated use of lethal force, by a State or organized armed group against a specific individual outside their physical custody.""  This, like other definitions, can be applied to most other applications of military force. It is not exclusive to a particular legal or illegal action.  In Israel, it generally refers to a policy of targeting of the top echelons of terrorist organizations. Yet this can also be seen as a natural military action in the course of war, rather than a distinct category under IHL.  Palestinian rescue workers inspect a house where Islamic Jihad commander Ahmed Abu Daqqa was killed in an Israeli strike, in the southern Gaza Strip May 11, 2023 (credit: REUTERS/IBRAHEEM ABU MUSTAFA)  How does international humanitarian law consider targeted killings?  There do exist tools within the IHL framework to determine the legality of a military strike.  There is little that differentiates the opening blow of Shield and Arrow from strikes conducted later in the operation, save for the ongoing launching of rockets from Gaza. This creates a question of military necessity, one of the main principles of IHL.  The IDF argues that there was an impending threat from the Islamic Jihad commanders, and this created military necessity to strike. Killing the commanders reduced the capabilities of the organization to conduct terrorist attacks.  Yet it could also be argued that it has become customary in IHL for terrorist leaders to demand killing over a more general threat posed to a state. It is disputed whether Osama Bin Laden presented an immediate threat to the United States of America when then-president Barack Obama ordered his killing. The US contended he was still operationally active, but cited no active field operation. There was little to no backlash over this action. The killing of Gazan PIJ leaders could likewise be seen as having degraded terrorist effort in part of a sequential attack, or war, against Israel and its citizens.  In the discussion of targeted killings, sometimes the question is one of distinction. Under this principle of IHL, one differentiate between civilians and combatants in attacks, and take necessary precautions to avoid civilian casualties.  The status of Gazan terrorists is a matter of debate. Some argue that terrorists are unlawful combatants, but retain the status of civilians. This means they are only considered combatants when they are directly involved in direct hostilities. In state armed forces, High ranking officers who do not fight and only command and plan far from the battlefield are generally considered legitimate targets. This likely means that the action of ordering and planning could be considered a direct hostile action.  Yet non-state armed groups are also bound by IHL in both international and non-international conflicts. These commanders were part of an organized military force that had a hierarchy, insignias and uniform. Many treat Gaza as a de facto state, and the terrorist organizations as de facto state military forces. Western states targeted leaders of the Islamic State with increasing regularity, treating them as if they were members of an opposing armed force of recognized combatants.  Unlike in the West Bank, it is difficult to argue that Gazans are under occupation, which would mean that they lack that unlawful combatants have the same protections in that state of conflict.  Some are quick to point out that even if there is no debate about whether Islamic Jihad commanders are legitimate targets under IHL as combatants, the Israeli strikes also took the lives of the terrorists' civilian family members.  This is a matter of applying the principle of proportionality. The military advantage of a strike must exceed the potential risk of damage to civilians. This is determined by a reasonable commander using the best information at the time.  It is difficult to determine without full access to the extent of the impending threat, and understanding how the commanders fit into the PIJ hierarchy, to determine if the value of the military degradation was greater than the risk to civilians.  These IHL principles of proportionality, distinction and military necessity should be applied to all such targeted killings -- as they are to all IDF military strikes.  Therein lies the problem with the debate about targeted killings: Despite discussion of premeditation and accuracy, the term is more of a nebulous pejorative used to cast aspersion on a military action rather than carefully explore and weigh the facts of the individual incident.  It has become a label for if one approves of a military strike against a terrorist or not. It is a label that applies to some states, like Israel, and rarely questioned when used by others."

Posting on Twitter using one of his accounts, Tinoedza Zvimwe, Charamba claimed Mnangagwa was invited to Charles III’s coronation on 06 May 2023 after he saved the latter from assassination by Rhodesians. He wrote:  Charles, now King Charles III, would have been killed by Rhodesians, except for a tip-off from a Rhodesian intelligence officer to the current President, then as state security minister. That all explains why ED had to be at King Charles’ coronation, and why relations with the UK are fated for a reset under President ED! Enjoy!  Meanwhile, some social media users mocked Mnangagwa saying he was snubbed during King Charles III’s coronation in London on Saturday.  However, ZANU PF spokesperson Chris Mutsvangwa said that Mnangagwa was not part of the heads of State and government who had a photo opportunity with King Charles III because Zimbabwe is not a Commonwealth member.  Speaking on the sidelines of the burial of national hero Abraham Kabasa in Harare on Monday, Mutsvangwa said:  We are not a member of the Commonwealth, the President is determined that we should be readmitted into the group of nations.  Mutsvangwa added that Zimbabwe does not have the right to get close and personal with the king as it is not a Commonwealth member. He said:  But as for Zimbabwe, we did not have the right because we are not yet a member of the grouping. When we become a member, we would be part of those who will be close to the king. We want to engage with countries that we have cordial relationships and re-engage those we have had frosty relationships with in the past. Our President always says we are friends to all and enemies to none. We were happy that our President was invited to King Charles III’s coronation. When he was still a prince, he lowered the Union Jack (British flag) and raised the Zimbabwean flag after we had won the liberation struggle in 1980. It’s a person who we like a lot and it was imperative for the President to attend. This shows that the engagement between Harare and London is going in a good direction.  More: Pindula News"

The two brothers identified as Aaron Onuoha, 41 and Obinechi Samuel Onuoha, 35, were gruesomely assassinated in their family house at Ohanku by Udoka Street/Amucha, off Ngwa Road on Wednesday morning.  SaharaReporters gathered that the assailants who were reportedly numbering over 50 and wore black attire, invaded the house at about 1:20 am. They were said to have surrounded the house and cut off the electricity supply before some of them stormed the compound and killed the brothers.  According to sources, the assailants also burnt the house.  Samuel was a fashion designer based in Aba, while Aaron was a builder and a sculptor, who was based in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State.  Aaron had visited his brother on Tuesday evening to discuss family matters.  The hoodlums also allegedly attacked the Chief Security Officer of the area and burnt the security post.  A source told SaharaReporters that the CSO narrowly escaped being killed by the assailants.  A close associate of the late Samuel who spoke to SaharaReporters on condition of anonymity, revealed that he was attacked last year by hoodlums suspected to be cultists but survived the attack.  ""In that particular attack, it was in the daytime and he saw the faces of those who tried to kill him,” the source said.  He continued, ""I find it unbelievable because that night when I got information about the incident, I rushed to the scene. And while I was going, I met several local security personnel at their checkpoints.  “So where were they when the brothers were being killed and their house set ablaze?""  According to him, he later heard a report that the assailants accused Samuel of giving out information to police about them and their hideouts.  He said, “I know that he had police friends who were working with the police Rapid Response Squad (RRS) in Aba.  ""Before his gruesome killing, I had on one occasion asked whether he gave information about bad boys to the police and he said no. According to him, when he was attacked the last time by some cult group, he went to RRS office to see some of his friends, especially his in-law and one of the cult guys that shot at him. He told the in-law that this one was among those that attacked him and that is all.""  The source, however, regretted that no security agent either from the police division around the area or the RSS unit intervened during the attack until the morning when the criminals had gone.  Also speaking to SaharaReporters, a sibling of the deceased brothers, Agbeze Onuoha confirmed the tragic incident and called on security agencies to fish out the perpetrators to ensure that they face justice.  Lamenting the incident, he said his late brothers left behind 10 children – five each. He asked how he would cope with caring for the wives and children left behind.  Narrating the unfortunate incident, Agbeze, an employee of Enugu Electricity Distribution Company in Abakaliki, the Ebonyi State capital, said, ""I came back to see my mother on Saturday and I was supposed to go back to my working station on Wednesday. Unfortunately, that early Wednesday morning, my phone rang; it was my nephew. He called to tell me that two of my brothers had been killed.  ""The elder one Aaron is living at Uyo in Akwa Ibom State but came back to see his brother in Aba on Tuesday and they were killed together. That is what I can say, I don't know what transpired. I just came to see our mother in Aba because my family is in Okigwe, Imo State while I am working in Abakaliki.  ""So when I got the report, I went there and saw what happened and reported to the police. They came and carried their corpses to the mortuary.""  He added that Samuel's wife who was present when the assailants killed the brother, said the killers drove her and her five children out of the house before burning it.  He said according to her, the assailants were more than 50 in number and were in black attire.  He added, ""From the information I gathered, their killers said Samuel was giving information to police where they are. Even the children said when they went to fetch water, some people were telling them that their father used to give information to the police about them.""  ""My family is demanding justice; the police should fish out their killers and make them pay for their crimes,"" he said.  Agbeze, however, noted that he had informed Aaron’s wife about the tragic incident, adding that he was “planning to bury them next week"".  When SaharaReporters contacted the spokesperson for the state police command, SP Geoffrey Ogbonna, for an update, he declined to comment."
