Ashlee Wilson, 34, from Banksia Grove, in Perth's north-east, was home alone last week when she rang triple zero complaining of severe stomach pains.  Little did she know, she was pregnant with her daughter Marley-Rae, who was born just six minutes after paramedics arrived.  'I said to (the paramedic), ''No I'm not (pregnant)'', and she said, ''Yes you are'',' Ms Wilson told Sunrise.  Ms Wilson could be heard wailing in agony in audio of the phone call she made to emergency services.  'The pain is coming right now, ugh!' she was heard crying out.  'Oh my God! I'm just sitting on the toilet because it feels like something's trying to come out but there's nothing there and it hurts!'  There was no time to rush to the hospital once paramedics arrived and Ms Wilson ended up giving birth to little Marley-Rae in her living room.  'I was in complete denial, I did not want to believe (the paramedic) at all,' she said.  'I was scared about what was happening to my body at the time and I was just in big denial.'  The 34-year-old had gone to her doctor complaining of a bloating issue but was bizarrely told just to drink more water and eat peanuts.  'Visually it was really hard to see, a lot of my family have been going through photos and saying ''even there you don't look pregnant'',' she said.  Ms Wilson admitted that because she had no idea she was pregnant, she was 'kind of in party mode'.  Ashlee Wilson, 34, from Banksia Grove, in Perth's north-east, was home alone last week when she rang triple zero complaining of severe stomach pains  'Of course there were things I was doing that I shouldn't have been doing that now I look back and think, ''Oh my God I'm so sorry if anything happens to you because of that'',' she added.  Both Ms Wilson and Marley-Rae are doing well one week on, with the mother saying the birth of her little girl is one of the best things that has ever happened to her.  'Here I was thinking I wanted to be an interstate truck driver a week-and-a-half-ago, now I want to give her the world and take it over with her,' she said.  St John Ambulance paramedic Melissa Gardiner said she felt lucky she was called out to the house.  'I feel like I was literally made for meeting Ashlee and Marley-Rae helping her into the world,' she said.  'Everything that I've done in my career has pretty much I think led me to Saturday morning.'"

Example video title will go here for this video  DAVIS, Calif. — A Davis couple got a special surprise on Mother's Day: a newborn. Laura Barnett gave birth for the first time to a baby girl at 10:02 a.m. Sunday.  She spoke with ABC10 just hours after giving birth via C-section at Sutter Davis Hospital.  ""She is beautiful and just seems healthy. I'm really grateful,"" said Laura.  Laura told ABC10 Lana was due on June 1, but she arrived a few weeks early.  ""I was nervous about it being early, but honestly, it feels like the best gift that I could have gotten,"" she said.  Little Lana is already giving lots of love this Mother’s Day to her two moms, Laura and Leilani Barnett.  ""It's really special to have such a special gift on Mother’s Day,"" said Leilani.  Leilani and Laura have been together for several years. The couple picked Lana's name together with an important meaning to them.  ""Leilani's name is Hawaiian and Lana is also Hawaiian, it means afloat and calm and still waters,"" said Laura.  Baby Lana will grow up with lots of support as well. She will soon get to meet her five siblings, including three foster kids the couple has raised.  ""We're just really excited to be moms to a newborn. We actually have four teenagers at home and this is Laura's first birth and I've never given birth so it’s exciting to add a newborn to the family,"" said Leilani.  This Mother’s Day surprise means so much to the couple.  ""There's many different kind of moms who are birth moms and who aren't birth moms and so we're excited to celebrate this birth and also love all of our kids who we didn't birth,"" said Leilani. ""She's been so sweet. She's just been very chill and hardly has cried at all. She's just a little cutie pie, so we're really excited.""  Baby Lana and her moms are some of the first patients to utilize Sutter Davis Hospital's newly expanded Family Birth Center, which opened on May 12. The hospital added new labor and delivery rooms, post-partum suites and new tubs for the hospital's water birthing program.  WATCH ALSO:"
