The 35-year-old actress looked stunning during her return to a film set with a light brown halter-style dress that showed off her incredible post-baby body while highlighting her reddish-brown tresses in natural waves.  The Age Of Adaline star — who gave birth in February — and the Jane The Virgin actor, 39, star opposite each other in It Ends With Us, a film adaptation of Colleen Hoover's 2016 bestselling romance novel that marks her first movie role in three years.  While on set, the Gossip Girl alumna — who brought her two eldest children to Taylor Swift's concert in Philadelphia on Saturday — teamed her dress with a pair of patterned socks and chunky loafers.  Later, she was seen throwing on a bubblegum pink Carhartt T-shirt as well as a hot pink work jacket over the summer dress.

For jewelry, she accessorized with no necklaces or bracelets but, rather, various statement rings.  At one point, the Sandman vet was also seen carrying a cream canvas tote bag with the black Valentino Garavani monogram.  Also dressed casually for the scene, Baldoni sported a clinging, long-sleeved top in black as well as a pair of dark trousers.

But under the sweater she had a breast pump running, and the tube could be seen running out from her shirt to the device on the bathroom counter.  The Age Of Adaline actress wasn't afraid to be silly with the photo, and she added dual spurts of milk emanating from her chest.

Kunal Sen believed his father would have adapted to the technological advancements to make low-budget films.    From ‘Mrigayaa’, ‘Calcutta 71’, ‘Kharij’, ‘Ek Din Pratidin’, to ‘Bhuvan Shome’, Sen, who gave birth to a new cinema movement in India, highlighted the middle-class lives in the city through most of his films.  However, as Anjan Dutt rightly pointed out, Sen’s films threw questions at the audience, actors and even himself. However, he never sought solutions.  Kolkata is celebrating the birth centenary of the master filmmaker. On Monday, an eight-day birth centenary celebration, titled ‘Sentenary’ kicked off at Gorky Sadan. Beginning Monday, (May 15), the celebrations which comprise exhibitions, talk shows and film screenings, will continue till May 22.  Madhabi Mukherjee, who stole our hearts forever with her performance in ‘Baishe Srabon’, Bangladesh filmmaker Tanvir Mokammel, Goutam Ghose, Mamata Shankar, Ashoke Viswanathan and Kunal were present at the inauguration at Gorky Sadan.  An exhibition of his photographs, posters, journals, books on and by Sen, letters and mementoes is on at Gorky Sadan for all film buffs from 3.30 pm to 5.30 pm, except May 17 and May 21.  The inauguration ceremony was followed by the screening of the documentary titled ‘With Mrinal Sen’ directed by Sanjay and Subrata Bhattacharya. For the next five days, his cult films like ‘Baishe Srabon’, ‘Matira Manisha’, ‘Oka Oori Katha’ and ‘Genesis’ would be screened along with adda sessions on the maestro.  “My father always made low-budget films. Today, technology has made huge advancements and I am sure, Bondhu (as he would call his father) would have adapted to this changing technology and made films within a restricted budget,” said Kunal, who has written a book, ‘Bondhu — My Father, My Friend?’ on the master filmmaker."

On Monday, the Canadian artist's Twitter and Instagram accounts had updated to display his birth name rather than his artistic name.

And Tesfaye revealed that his upcoming album might well be The Weeknd's swansong.  ""The album I'm working on now is probably my last hurrah as The Weeknd,"" he told W Magazine.  ""This is something that I have to do. As The Weeknd, I've said everything I can say.""

He had the most monthly listeners on Spotify, with 111.4 million as of March 20, and also became the first artist to reach 100 million monthly listeners.  A surge in listens was fueled in part by the fact that a remix of ""Die for You,"" featuring Ariana Grande, went viral on TikTok, according to GWR.  The track went to number one on the Billboard Hot 100 -- The Weeknd's seventh time at the top spot. The original ""Die for You"" was released in 2016 on his album ""Starboy."""

Ashlee Wilson, 34, from Banksia Grove, in Perth's north-east, was home alone last week when she rang triple zero complaining of severe stomach pains.  Little did she know, she was pregnant with her daughter Marley-Rae, who was born just six minutes after paramedics arrived.  'I said to (the paramedic), ''No I'm not (pregnant)'', and she said, ''Yes you are'',' Ms Wilson told Sunrise.  Ms Wilson could be heard wailing in agony in audio of the phone call she made to emergency services.  'The pain is coming right now, ugh!' she was heard crying out.  'Oh my God! I'm just sitting on the toilet because it feels like something's trying to come out but there's nothing there and it hurts!'  There was no time to rush to the hospital once paramedics arrived and Ms Wilson ended up giving birth to little Marley-Rae in her living room.  'I was in complete denial, I did not want to believe (the paramedic) at all,' she said.  'I was scared about what was happening to my body at the time and I was just in big denial.'  The 34-year-old had gone to her doctor complaining of a bloating issue but was bizarrely told just to drink more water and eat peanuts.  'Visually it was really hard to see, a lot of my family have been going through photos and saying ''even there you don't look pregnant'',' she said.  Ms Wilson admitted that because she had no idea she was pregnant, she was 'kind of in party mode'.  Ashlee Wilson, 34, from Banksia Grove, in Perth's north-east, was home alone last week when she rang triple zero complaining of severe stomach pains  'Of course there were things I was doing that I shouldn't have been doing that now I look back and think, ''Oh my God I'm so sorry if anything happens to you because of that'',' she added.  Both Ms Wilson and Marley-Rae are doing well one week on, with the mother saying the birth of her little girl is one of the best things that has ever happened to her.  'Here I was thinking I wanted to be an interstate truck driver a week-and-a-half-ago, now I want to give her the world and take it over with her,' she said.  St John Ambulance paramedic Melissa Gardiner said she felt lucky she was called out to the house.  'I feel like I was literally made for meeting Ashlee and Marley-Rae helping her into the world,' she said.
