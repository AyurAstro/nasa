Hamdani.  On Jan. 29, Maria Aguilar arrived at the Hidalgo port of entry with three minors in her vehicle. At that time, she claimed they were her relatives and presented Ohio birth certificates.  Law enforcement noticed the children appeared nervous and ultimately discovered the birth certificates were for other people.  Aguilar admitted the minors were not relatives, but undocumented aliens, and expected to be paid $4,700 to smuggle the minors into the United States.  U.S. District Judge Ricardo Hinojosa will impose sentencing Aug. 17. At that time, Aguilar faces up to 10 years in prison and a possible $250,000 maximum fine.  She was permitted to remain on bond pending that hearing.  Customs and Border Protection conducted the investigation. Assistant U.S. Attorney Theodore Parran III prosecuted the case."

Every 2 seconds, a baby is born too soon. Every 40 seconds, one of those babies dies. In the last decade, preterm birth rates have not changed in any region of the world. Coverage is highly inequitable and challenges disproportionately affect those most vulnerable. For example, nearly 1 in 10 preterm babies are born in the 10 most fragile countries affected by humanitarian crises where accessing care is particularly challenging.  This is unacceptable as the majority of related deaths and disabilities are preventable.

(Envato Elements)  Scientists have found that a plastic sheet with a funnel-like pouch attached to the bottom edge can, along with a few other steps, cut life-threatening bleeding after vaginal births in hospitals by 60%. This is according to a study presented at the International Maternal Newborn Health Conference held in Cape Town last week. The research was also published in The New England Journal of Medicine.  The piece of plastic, which researchers call a “drape”, is slid in underneath the patient and tied around her waist after she’s given birth. It collects blood in a pouch that hangs off the bottom end of the hospital bed — and it costs less than R30.  In South Africa, one of the most common causes of women dying as a result of pregnancy is excessive bleeding.

Dr. Florence Comite talked about the critical role of hormones (including testosterone) in overall health and how the long-term use of hormonal birth control (which many women rely on!) can influence our hormones and health outcomes.  “Hormones affect every function in the body and serve as messengers from our brain.”, said Dr. Comite.

Overall, exposure rises in adolescence — 14 is the mean age of seeing somebody shot and 17 is the mean age for being shot.  “The oldest cohorts were quite disadvantaged,” Sampson noted, “because they came of age during the peak of violence in the United States and Chicago.” U.S. homicide rates topped out in the early 1990s, just as those born in the early ’80s reached their teens. Around half of respondents born in 1981 and 1984 reported witnessing gun violence, while those who had been shot hovered around 7 percent.  As crime rates declined, subsequent birth cohorts faced less exposure to firearms. Those born in 1996 reported the lowest levels of seeing somebody shot — their exposure was half that of the two oldest cohorts — but direct victimization was another story. “Surprisingly,” Sampson added, “unlike witnessing violence, there was no statistical difference"

Kunal Sen believed his father would have adapted to the technological advancements to make low-budget films.    From ‘Mrigayaa’, ‘Calcutta 71’, ‘Kharij’, ‘Ek Din Pratidin’, to ‘Bhuvan Shome’, Sen, who gave birth to a new cinema movement in India, highlighted the middle-class lives in the city through most of his films.  However, as Anjan Dutt rightly pointed out, Sen’s films threw questions at the audience, actors and even himself. However, he never sought solutions.  Kolkata is celebrating the birth centenary of the master filmmaker. On Monday, an eight-day birth centenary celebration, titled ‘Sentenary’ kicked off at Gorky Sadan. Beginning Monday, (May 15), the celebrations which comprise exhibitions, talk shows and film screenings, will continue till May 22.  Madhabi Mukherjee, who stole our hearts forever with her performance in ‘Baishe Srabon’, Bangladesh filmmaker Tanvir Mokammel, Goutam Ghose, Mamata Shankar, Ashoke Viswanathan and Kunal were present at the inauguration at Gorky Sadan.  An exhibition of his photographs, posters, journals, books on and by Sen, letters and mementoes is on at Gorky Sadan for all film buffs from 3.30 pm to 5.30 pm, except May 17 and May 21.  The inauguration ceremony was followed by the screening of the documentary titled ‘With Mrinal Sen’ directed by Sanjay and Subrata Bhattacharya. For the next five days, his cult films like ‘Baishe Srabon’, ‘Matira Manisha’, ‘Oka Oori Katha’ and ‘Genesis’ would be screened along with adda sessions on the maestro.  “My father always made low-budget films. Today, technology has made huge advancements and I am sure, Bondhu (as he would call his father) would have adapted to this changing technology and made films within a restricted budget,” said Kunal, who has written a book, ‘Bondhu — My Father, My Friend?’ on the master filmmaker."

Example video title will go here for this video  DAVIS, Calif. — A Davis couple got a special surprise on Mother's Day: a newborn. Laura Barnett gave birth for the first time to a baby girl at 10:02 a.m. Sunday.  She spoke with ABC10 just hours after giving birth via C-section at Sutter Davis Hospital.  ""She is beautiful and just seems healthy. I'm really grateful,"" said Laura.  Laura told ABC10 Lana was due on June 1, but she arrived a few weeks early.  ""I was nervous about it being early, but honestly, it feels like the best gift that I could have gotten,"" she said.  Little Lana is already giving lots of love this Mother’s Day to her two moms, Laura and Leilani Barnett.  ""It's really special to have such a special gift on Mother’s Day,"" said Leilani.  Leilani and Laura have been together for several years. The couple picked Lana's name together with an important meaning to them.  ""Leilani's name is Hawaiian and Lana is also Hawaiian, it means afloat and calm and still waters,"" said Laura.  Baby Lana will grow up with lots of support as well. She will soon get to meet her five siblings, including three foster kids the couple has raised.  ""We're just really excited to be moms to a newborn. We actually have four teenagers at home and this is Laura's first birth and I've never given birth so it’s exciting to add a newborn to the family,"" said Leilani.  This Mother’s Day surprise means so much to the couple.  ""There's many different kind of moms who are birth moms and who aren't birth moms and so we're excited to celebrate this birth and also love all of our kids who we didn't birth,"" said Leilani. ""She's been so sweet. She's just been very chill and hardly has cried at all. She's just a little cutie pie, so we're really excited.""  Baby Lana and her moms are some of the first patients to utilize Sutter Davis Hospital's newly expanded Family Birth Center, which opened on May 12. The hospital added new labor and delivery rooms, post-partum suites and new tubs for the hospital's water birthing program.  WATCH ALSO:"
