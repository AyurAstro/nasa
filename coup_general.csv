Use Next and Previous buttons to navigate  BANGKOK (AP) — Following a stunning election victory in which they together captured a majority of seats in the House of Representatives, Thailand’s top two opposition parties began planning Monday for the next stage in their bid to replace the military-dominated government.  The Move Forward Party, led by 42-year-old businessman Pita Limjaroenrat, placed first in the election, surpassing most expectations. It squeaked past the Pheu Thai party, which had been favored to top the polls.  Pheu Thai stumbled despite the star power of Paetongtarn Shinawatra, daughter of Thaksin Shinawatra, the former populist prime minister who was toppled by a 2006 military coup and is the driving force behind the party.  “The overwhelming electoral victory by Move Forward and Pheu Thai is a decisive sign that voters want a polity where the people, not the military, decide their future,” said Tyrell Haberkorn, a Thai studies scholar at the University of Wisconsin.  “Voters want a Thailand with free speech, without compulsory military conscription, and where the people’s voices are valued, not something to be silenced or bought,” she said.  Pita said Monday he has been talking to five other parties about forming a coalition government. It would have 309 House seats in total, providing more stability than the 292-seat partnership with Pheu Thai as a sole ally. Parliament selects a new prime minister in July, so has about two months to seal a deal.  Move Forward's supporters drove through the streets of Bangkok on Monday afternoon to celebrate their victory. Pita smiled broadly and waved as a convoy of open trucks took him and other party members slowly through the streets of the old part of the capital.  Thailand for the past nine years has been led by former army commander Prayuth Chan-ocha, who seized power in a 2014 military coup and was returned as prime minister after the 2019 election. He ran for reelection on Sunday, but has been blamed for a lagging economy, a botched initial response to the coronavirus pandemic and for thwarting democratic reforms — a particular sore point with younger voters.  “The sentiment of the era has changed and it’s right,” Pita said Monday. “And today it’s a new day and hopefully it’s full of bright sunshine of hope going forward.”  Earlier, as it became clear his party was taking the lead, he tweeted that he is ready to bring about change as the country’s 30th prime minister. “Whether you agree or disagree with me, I will be your prime minister. Whether you have voted for me or not, I will serve you.""  Move Forward and Pheu Thai are mostly allied in their opposition to the military’s recurring interference in politics, demonstrated by more than a dozen coups it has staged since 1932, when Thailand became a constitutional monarchy, and most recently in 2006 and 2014.  Both parties also favor reform of some aspects of the monarchy, a position that riles the conservative royalist establishment that regards the institution as sacrosanct. Because Move Forward has been more outspoken on the subject, it is regarded as radical in the context of mainstream Thai politics.  With almost all votes counted Monday, Move Forward had captured a projected 151 seats in the lower house by winning over 24% of the popular vote for 400 constituency seats, and more than 36% of the votes for the 100 seats allocated by proportional representation.  Pheu Thai party trailed a close second with its combined seat total projected at 141.  Prayuth's United Thai Nation Party holds fifth spot in the constituency vote and third in the party-preference tally, for a projected total of 36 seats.  Although the numbers place Pita in a favorable position for becoming the next prime minister, he faces a difficult path.  Candidates are handicapped by constitutional rules crafted by the military government to restrain political parties with populist appeals from taking root and upending the long-established conservative order.  The prime minister is elected by a joint session of the 500 members of the newly elected House and 250 senators, who were appointed by the military. The winner must secure at least 376 votes.  The Senate, a stalwart defender of the royalist order along with the army and the courts, voted unanimously for Prayuth in 2019, enabling him to overcome Pheu Thai’s first-place finish and form a coalition government.  There is a strong possibility that Pita will be seen as too radical by some partner parties, and they will have to look for a more moderate candidate.  Pheu Thai’s Paetongtarn is the most popular choice of her party base. But her ties to her father, Thaksin, with whom the military has never reconciled since ousting him in 2006, would make winning any support from the Senate difficult. One of Pheu Thai’s other candidates for prime minister, real estate magnate Srettha Thavisin, would stand a better chance in that case.  There are also fears the conservative elements in Thai politics would again employ what critics consider to be dirty tricks to keep a hold on power. Since Thaksin’s fall, they have repeatedly used the courts and so-called independent state agencies such as the Election Commission to issue controversial legal rulings to cripple or sink political threats from opponents. Such efforts would likely stir up vigorous street protests.  “Is the form of coalition that Pita proposed, with 309 seats, stable enough? In a democratic world, it’s the most stable. But in a world of half-dictatorship that has the Senate as an important variable, Move Forward must lever the Senate with the people’s voices,” said Pinkaew Laungaramsri, a professor of anthropology at Chiang Mai University.  “We have to wait and see whether the authoritarians will dare using their illegitimate authorities that go against the will of the people. If they do that, it’s just creating a condition for the people to go back onto the streets,* she said.  ___  Associated Press video journalist Jerry Harmer contributed to this report."

The progressive Move Forward Party, which gained a huge following among young Thais for its reformist platform, won the most seats and the largest share of the popular vote.  Pheu Thai, the main opposition party that has been a populist force in Thailand for 20 years, came second.  Together they delivered a crushing blow to the conservative, military-backed establishment that has ruled on and off for decades, often by turfing out popularly elected governments in coups.  “This is an unmistakable frontal rebuke, a rejection of Thailand’s military authoritarian past. It’s a rejection of military dominance in politics,” said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political scientist from Chulalongkorn University.  Over the last two decades, each time Thais have been allowed to vote, they have done so overwhelmingly in support of the military’s political opponents. Sunday’s vote – which saw a record turnout – was a continuation of that tradition.  But despite winning a landslide, it is far from certain who will be the next leader.  Supporters of the Move Forward Party react as they watch results come in at the party headquarters in Bangkok on May 14, after polls closed in Thailand's general election. Jack Taylor/AFP/Getty Images  That’s because the military junta that last seized power in 2014 rewrote the constitution to ensure they maintain a huge say in who can lead, whether or not they win the popular vote.  Neither opposition party won an outright majority of 376 seats needed to form a government outright, they will need to strike deals and wrangle support from other parties to form a coalition big enough to ensure victory.  But that won’t necessarily be straightforward.  Dangerous territory  The first thing to know is that any opposition party or coalition hoping to form a government must overcome the powerful voting bloc of the senate.  Under the junta-era constitution, Thailand’s unelected 250-seat senate is chosen entirely by the military and has previously voted for a pro-military candidate.  Because a party needs a majority of the combined houses – 750 seats – to elect a prime minister, it means opposition parties need almost three times as many votes in the lower house to be able to elect the next leader and form a government.  In 2019, coup leader Prayut Chan-o-cha won the senate votes which ensured his party’s coalition gained enough seats to elect him as prime minister, despite Pheu Thai being the largest party.  There are also other threats to the progressive movement’s win. Parties that have previously pushed for change have run afoul of the powerful conservative establishment – a nexus of the military, monarchy and influential elites.  Move Forward Party leader and prime ministerial candidate, Pita Limjaroenrat, attends a press conference following the general election, at the party's headquarters in Bangkok, Thailand, on May 15. Athit Perawongmetha/Reuters  Lawmakers have faced bans, parties have been dissolved, and governments have been overthrown. Thailand has witnessed a dozen successful coups since 1932, including two in the past 17 years.  And the purportedly independent election commission, anti-corruption commission and the constitutional court are all dominated in favor of the establishment.  In the progressive camp’s favor, however, is their large margin over the military-backed parties.  “If the results were murky, or if the pro-military parties got more, then we would be looking at manipulation, trying to shave the margins. But the results are so clear and very difficult to overturn now,” said Thitinan, adding that if there were attempts to subvert the vote, there would be public anger and protests.  Move Forward’s predecessor the Future Forward Party won the third most seats in the 2019 election. Shortly afterward, several of the party’s leaders were banned from politics and the party was later dissolved after a court ruled it violated electoral finance rules.  In the short term, that decision ended the threat from the Future Forward Party. But it also, in many ways, laid the foundation for Sunday’s historic vote.  Youth-led protests erupted across Thailand in 2020 after Future Forward was dissolved and a whole new generation of young political leaders were born, some of whom were willing to debate a previously taboo topic – royal reform.  Those calls electrified Thailand, where any frank discussion of the monarchy is fraught with the threat of prison under one of the strictest lese majeste laws in the world.  Many youth leaders were jailed or face ongoing prosecution linked to those protests. But some also went on to create the Move Forward party that swept to victory in the popular vote on Sunday.  That leaves the military establishment now locked in a political battle with a party that has kept the subject of royal reform on its manifesto.  Experts have said another coup would be costly, and dissolving a party with such a mandate would be “drastic.”  “Dissolving a party is a fairly drastic move. If there’s a way of keeping Move Forward out without dissolving them, then conservative politicians would probably prefer to do that. Because it’s not as strong a step in subverting the will that people have expressed,” said Susannah Patton, director of the Southeast Asia Program at the Lowy Institute.  “But you can’t rule that out.”  See why Thailand's ex-coup leader is showing a softer side ahead of election 02:58 - Source: CNN  Vote for change cannot be ignored  Move Forward’s allure went beyond the youth vote on which it built its base.  Unofficial results showed the party captured 32 out of 33 seats in Bangkok – traditionally a stronghold for conservative parties.  “What this shows is that people who are living in urban areas are really fed up with the government that the military has provided for almost a decade,” said Patton.  “They are wanting to choose something different, and Move Forward is not just the youth party but actually can attract a wider cross section of support as well.”  Move Forward’s radical agenda includes reforming the military, getting rid of the draft, reducing the military’s budget, making it more transparent and accountable, as well as constitutional change and to bring the military and monarchy within the constitution.  The party’s win over the populist juggernaut Pheu Thai is also significant. This is the first time a party linked with ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has lost an election since 2001.  And Pheu Thai’s marginal defeat to Move Forward shows voters’ frustration with the old cycle of politics that pitted populist Thaksin-linked parties against the establishment.  Thailand’s “two party system was already breaking down in 2019, but it’s continuing to break down this election,” said Patton.  In a press conference on Monday, Move Forward leader Pita Limjaroenrat said the party would go forward with plans to amend the country’s strict lese majeste laws – a key campaign pledge despite the taboo surrounding any discussion of the royal family in Thailand.  One of his priorities is to support young people facing jail terms on lese majeste charges, and Pita warned that if the law remains as it is, the relationship between the Thai people and the monarchy will only worsen.  His policies “strike at heart of the establishment,” said Thitinan, and even talking about the monarchy openly “is an affront to the palace.”  The Move Forward leader said Monday that he wants to form an alliance with the four other opposition parties to secure a majority in the lower house.  It could take 60 days before a prime ministerial candidate is endorsed by Thailand’s combined houses of parliament, but Sunday’s vote shows the people are ready for change.  However, if Thailand’s turbulent recent history is anything to go by, that could mean little. The military has shown in the past that it has few qualms about ignoring the popular vote."

The results of Sunday’s general election are a strong repudiation of the country’s conservatives and reflect the disenchantment in particular of young voters who want to limit the influence of the military in politics and reform the monarchy.  But the exact shape of the new government is less clear as post-election coalition talks and behind-the-scene negotiations take center stage.  The results  With almost all votes counted Monday, the Move Forward Party emerged as the big winner. It captured a projected 151 seats in the lower House by winning over 24% of the popular vote for 400 constituency seats, and more than 36% of the 100 seats allocated by proportional representation.  Tailing a close second is the main opposition Pheu Thai Party, whose combined seat total is projected at 141.  The party of incumbent Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former army general who came to power in the 2014 coup, held the fifth spot in the constituency vote and third in the party-preference tally, for a projected total of 36 seats.  Voter turnout was about 75% of the 52 million registered voters.  What’s next?  Who becomes the next prime minister will depend on a vote set for July that includes all the House lawmakers plus the 250-seat military-appointed Senate, whose members share the establishment’s conservative policies. The winner must attain at least 376 of their combined 750 seats.  Opposition parties have criticized the process as undemocratic. It’s a legacy of the 2014 coup and a new constitution drafted in its aftermath that was meant to ensure that the military and the state bureaucracy, the main upholders of the royal order, continue to hold sway.  Analysts have pointed out that a lot can still happen before the Election Commission even declares the results valid, a process that can take up to 75 days and will almost certainly include legal challenges.  In the past, the commission and the courts have used their authority to disqualify opposition parties.  What the opposition wants  Move Forward leader Pita Limjaroenrat tweeted that he is ready to bring about change as the country’s 30th prime minister.  “Whether you agree or disagree with me, I will be your prime minister. Whether you have voted for me or not, I will serve you,” he wrote.  Although he energized younger voters with his progressive agenda, the businessman has alarmed conservatives with calls for reform of the monarchy, the institution that has been traditionally treated as sacrosanct.  In 2019, the Constitutional Court ousted his colleague from Parliament on charges of violating the election law and dissolved the Future Forward party, which then changed its name and leadership to become Move Forward.  It had been supporting amending the draconian law that punishes defaming the monarchy, which according to critics has been used as a tool to quash political dissent and imprison pro-democracy student activists.  Student-led protests beginning in 2020 openly criticized the monarchy, previously a taboo subject, leading to vigorous prosecutions under the law. They were also dismayed by the dissolution of the Future Forward party, which they believed was an unfair use of state power.  Thaksin’s shadow  Pheu Thai is led by Paetongtarn Shinawatra, the daughter of billionaire former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra who was toppled in a 2006 coup.  The power struggle between Thaksin’s supporters, many of them rural poor who benefited from his populist policies, and his conservative opponents has been fought – sometimes in the street, sometimes at the ballot box – for almost two decades.  In the 2014 coup, Mr. Chan-ocha unseated the government of Yingluck Shinawatra – Paetongtarn’s aunt, Thaksin’s sister – as prime minister. And Pheu Thai topped the field in the 2019 vote, only to be denied power when the army-backed Palang Pracharath Party found partners to assemble a coalition government.

Photo: Lillian Suwanrumpha/AFP via Getty  Thai voters made clear in Sunday's election that they want change. The question is now whether the military-aligned establishment will let them have it.  Why it matters: Sunday's result was a political earthquake, not just because pro-democracy parties trounced pro-military ones, but also because the progressive party that finished first, Move Forward, campaigned on the once-taboo topic of reforming the monarchy.  Move Forward leader Pita Limjaroenrat, a former business executive and relative newcomer to politics who studied at Harvard and MIT, introduced himself on Monday as ""the next prime minister of Thailand.""  The twin pillars of Thailand's establishment, the military and the monarchy, have the power to block him. Thailand has seen 12 successful coups since 1932, and parties or candidates have frequently been disqualified from holding office even after elections were held.  But such an intervention would risk ""major street violence"" and create ""an incredibly unstable situation,"" says Joshua Kurlantzick, senior fellow for Southeast Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations.  ""Thailand is the only upper-middle income country that regularly has coups,"" Kurlantzick tells Axios. ""Young Thais are tired of the economy and politics being stuck in this archaic past, run by generals and kings.""  The big picture: Before Sunday's shock result, the election had been billed as a showdown between the military and the Shinawatra political dynasty, represented by the Pheu Thai party.  Parties associated with former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra had won the most seats in every election since 2001, but were repeatedly elbowed out of power by the coup-prone military.  This time, Thaksin's daughter Paethongtarn Shinawatra was on the ballot, facing off against Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who led a 2014 coup and retained power after the 2019 election. His popularity has since collapsed.  Meanwhile, massive pro-democracy protests broke out in 2020, with student leaders demanding reform not just of the military, but also of the monarchy.  That was unprecedented in a country where lèse-majesté laws mean criticizing Thailand's king can result in jail time. Dozens of protesters remain in prison.  In this election, Pheu Thai stuck to its pitch of lifting up lower-income voters but avoided the reform proposals that had energized the youthful protesters.  ""Pheu Thai fought the wrong war, the populism war that it already won. Move Forward takes the game to the next level with institutional reform. That's the new battleground in Thai politics,"" Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political scientist at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, told Reuters.  By the numbers: Move Forward won an estimated 151 of the 500 lower house seats, nearly sweeping the capital, Bangkok. Pheu Thai won 141. Pita announced on Monday that they'll try to form a government with four smaller parties, bringing the bloc's total to 309 seats.  That clear majority could nonetheless be insufficient because a new constitution brought in under Prayuth's junta gave 250 military-appointed senators a vote on prospective prime ministers. If the Senate votes against Pita's coalition, it would be rejected.  But Prayuth's party and another military-backed party only won a combined 76 seats.  Even if the pro-military bloc gets other nonaligned parties onside, it could only cobble together a very weak minority government. That is, unless it enticed Pheu Thai to join forces, though that currently looks unlikely.  What they're saying: Paethongtarn Shinawatra congratulated Pita and said she expects their parties to be able to work ""smoothly together.""  Prayuth said he respects ""the democratic process and the election results,"" a message that's undercut somewhat by his recent history as a coup leader.  For his part, Pita said there would be ""a hefty price to pay for someone who’s thinking of abolishing the election results or forming a minority government,"" adding: ""I don’t think the people of Thailand would allow that to happen.”  What's next: Thailand's Election Commission has 60 days to confirm the results, during which time Pita will likely work to solidify his coalition, while the other major players will plan their next moves."

Zelensky landed by helicopter at Chequers, the British leader’s official country retreat, and was greeted by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. It’s Zelensky’s second trip to the UK since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.  This is the fourth European country Zelenskky has visited in the past few days. He is seeking more aid as Ukraine prepares a long-anticipated spring offensive to retake territory seized by Russia.  Ukraine’s leader made an unannounced visit to Paris on Sunday evening to meet French President Emmanuel Macron, after trips to Germany and Italy, where he met those countries’ leaders and Pope Francis.  A message posted Monday on Zelensky’s official Telegram Channel said: “Today — London. The UK is leading the way when it comes to expanding our capabilities on the ground and in the air. This cooperation will continue today. I will meet my friend Rishi. We will conduct substantive negotiations face-to-face and in delegations.”  The UK has become one of Ukraine’s major military allies, sending Kyiv short-range missiles and Challenger tanks and training 15,000 Ukrainian troops on British soil. Last week Britain announced it had sent Ukraine Storm Shadow cruise missiles, which have a range of more than 250 kilometers (150 miles) — the first known shipment of the weaponry that Kyiv has long sought from its allies.  Sunak’s office said that on Monday Britain will confirm it is giving Ukraine hundreds more air defense missiles, as well as “long-range attack drones” with a range of more than 200 kilometers (120 miles).  “This is a crucial moment in Ukraine’s resistance to a terrible war of aggression they did not choose or provoke,” Sunak said. “They need the sustained support of the international community to defend against the barrage of unrelenting and indiscriminate attacks that have been their daily reality for over a year.  “We must not let them down.”  Sunak will also push allies to deliver more support to Ukraine at a meeting of Group of Seven leaders in Japan later this week, Downing Street said.  As Zelensky visited European capitals, Russia stepped up attacks across Ukraine with drones and missiles over the weekend. On Sunday, Russia shelled two communities in the northern border region of Sumy, the region’s military administration said in a statement on its official Telegram channel. It said 109 explosions were recorded.  Zelensky and Macron met for about three hours on Sunday at the French presidential Elysee Palace — an encounter kept under wraps until shortly before the Ukrainian leader’s arrival in Paris.  Macron’s office said France will supply dozens of light tanks and armored vehicles “in the weeks ahead,” without giving specific numbers. Also promised were more air defense systems, but again details weren’t made public.  More Ukrainians will also be made battle-ready, with France aiming to train about 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers in France this year and nearly 4,000 others in Poland as part of a wider European effort, Macron’s office said.  France has supplied Ukraine with an array of weaponry, include air defense systems, light tanks, howitzers and other arms and equipment and fuel.  France had dispatched a plane to pick up Zelensky in Germany, where he met with Chancellor Olaf Scholz earlier Sunday and discussed his country’s planned counteroffensive.  It was his first visit to Berlin since the start of the invasion and came a day after the German government announced a new package of military aid for Ukraine worth more than 2.7 billion euros ($3 billion), including tanks, anti-aircraft systems and ammunition.  After initially hesitating to provide Ukraine with lethal weapons, Germany has become one of the biggest suppliers of arms to Ukraine, including Leopard 1 and 2 battle tanks, and the sophisticated IRIS-T SLM air defense system. Modern Western hardware is considered crucial if Ukraine is to succeed in its planned counteroffensive.  In the western German city of Aachen, Zelensky also received the prestigious International Charlemagne Prize, awarded to him and the people of Ukraine.  On Saturday. he met Francis and Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni in Rome.  On the European trip, Zelensky said Ukraine will aim to liberate Russian-occupied areas within Ukraine’s internationally recognized borders, and not attack Russian territory.  The Washington Post cited previously undisclosed documents from a trove of US intelligence leaks suggesting that Zelensky has considered trying to capture areas in Russia proper for possible use as bargaining chips in peace negotiations to end the war launched by Moscow in February 2022. This would put him at odds with Western governments that have insisted that weapons they provide must not be used to attack targets in Russia.  Asked about the report, Zelensky said: “We don’t attack Russian territory, we liberate our own legitimate territory.”  “We have neither the time nor the strength (to attack Russia),” he said, according to an official interpreter. “And we also don’t have weapons to spare with which we could do this.”  “We are preparing a counterattack for the illegally occupied areas based on our constitutionally defined legitimate borders, which are recognized internationally,” Zelensky said.  Among areas still occupied by Russia are the Crimean peninsula and parts of eastern Ukraine with mainly Russian-speaking populations."

Awami League lawmaker Naheed on Wednesday filed the case against former army chief and former president Ziaur Rahman, retired Lieutenant Colonel Abu Taher, and 25 others, accusing them of taking part in the killings of her father Colonel Khandker Nazmul Huda, Major General Khaled Mosharraf, and Lieutenant Colonel ATM Haider in Dhaka during a turmoil inside the army on November 7, 1975.  ‘Naheed Izahar Khan filed the case against Ziaur Rahman for her father’s murder for the benefit of the current fascist Awami League regime. There is a political conspiracy behind it. The main reason is to divert domestic and foreign democracy-lovers’ attention from the ongoing anti-fascist movement,’ BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir said at a press conference at the party chairperson’s Gulshan office in Dhaka.  Giving a formal reaction about the case filed 48 years after the killing of Colonel Nazmul Huda in an army mutiny on November 7, 1975, the BNP leader said that Ziaur Rahman rather ordered the protection of Nazmul Huda.  In a written statement, the BNP secretary general mentioned that it was an irony that Naheed Ezaher Khan probably did not even read the book authored by her mother. Her mother, Neelufar Huda, clearly writes in the book titled ‘Colonel Huda O Amar Juddha’, stating the situation in which Colonel Huda was killed.  ‘The testimony of the people present there proves that on that day Ziaur Rahman ordered Colonel Nawazish Ahmed to protect Khaled Mosharraf, Colonel Huda, and Major Haider. On page 134 of the book written by the mother of the plaintiff, Naheed Ezaher Khan, Colonel Taher’s involvement in the murder has clearly emerged,’ Fakhrul said.  Mentioning that Colonel Huda was the brigade commander in Rangpur Cantonment in 1975, Fakhrul said that Colonel Huda was one of the participants in the military coup led by Khaled Mosharraf on November 3, 1975.  ‘He [Colonel Huda] came to Dhaka to lead the coup. It should be noted that the then army chief, Major General Ziaur Rahman, was put under house arrest to seize state power under Khaled Mosharraf. Basically, Khaled Mosharraf and his associates’ political ambitions led to the most brutal prison killings in history,’ he added.  Fakhrul said that the Khaled Mosharraf-led coup created an extremely chaotic environment in the army.  ‘By taking the opportunity, the Revolutionary Soldier Organization and Jasad Gono Bahini, led by Colonel Taher-Inu [Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal president Hasanul Haq Inu], staged a counter-coup, creating an army officer-soldier dispute in the army and participating in a far-reaching domestic-foreign plot to kill brutal army officers. Colonel Nazmul Huda, one of the participants in the Khaled Mosharraf-led coup, is a cruel victim,’ he said."

Now we know what he means.  If Labour wins next year, Starmer plans to rig future elections by giving the vote to millions of EU nationals, plus millions more 16 and 17-year-olds.  The plan would mean that 3.4million EU citizens with 'settled status' would be eligible to vote. Another 2.6million are 'pre-settled' and would doubtless be fast-tracked by Labour.  At a stroke, the electorate would be packed with some 6million foreign voters: More than enough to swing any general election – or a new EU referendum.  Enfranchising under-18s would add another 1.4million voters to the electoral roll.  © Provided by Daily Mail If Labour wins next year, Keir Starmer (pictured) plans to rig future elections by giving the vote to millions of EU nationals, plus millions more 16 and 17-year-olds  The audacity of this expansion of the franchise – the biggest for nearly a century since 1928, when most women got the vote – is exceeded only by its cynicism.  For Sir Keir knows, of course, that the great majority of these extra votes would go to him.  Handing the right to vote to foreigners and mid-teens would tilt the delicate balance of British politics permanently in Labour's favour. We know that Sir Keir would dearly love to reverse Brexit. Several million extra votes would enable him to pull off just such a coup within a few years of taking power.  Labour's plan would also be a giant step towards a one-party state. Many on the Left have looked enviously north of the border, as the SNP lowered the Scottish Parliament's voting age to 16 and extended it to EU citizens too.  Nicola Sturgeon, the former first minister, may now be disgraced and discredited, but – when it comes to her electoral initiatives – Labour is following her example.  Sir Keir's electoral stitch-up is so transparently self-interested that it amounts to political chicanery – 'dirty and nasty' indeed.  Yet the fact that it fails the smell test doesn't mean it could not happen. Most people will instinctively know that Labour's plan is wrong. But why?  Giving votes in general elections to EU residents would be a bad idea even if it were reciprocal. But it is not. Last year the European Court of Justice ruled that UK citizens living in France cannot vote even in local elections, let alone national ones.  © Provided by Daily Mail Labour's plan would also be a giant step towards a one-party state. Pictured: Starmer at a pro-EU rally in 2019  That ruling applies to all other EU countries apart from Ireland because it has a century-old reciprocal agreement on voting with Britain.  Why should the UK give votes to EU nationals who live and work here, when Brussels refuses to do the same for British expats in Europe?  A more fundamental reason for rejecting Labour's plan is that voting is the most basic of democratic rights, which ought to be granted only to British citizens with a permanent stake in the future of this country. My Polish daughter-in-law gained UK citizenship, not just by living here for a decade and mastering English, but by demonstrating her knowledge of and commitment to Britain, by – among other things – making a solemn oath of allegiance to the Crown.  To give the vote to foreigners who have done none of this, but merely have 'settled status', is to devalue the very idea of citizenship.  We all loathe the idea of 'health tourists' – visitors who come here only to take advantage of the NHS. So why create 'voting tourists'? As for giving the vote to 16 and 17-year-olds, this preposterous proposal ignores the fact that they are still adolescents and considered insufficiently mature to enjoy many of the rights and freedoms that over-18s enjoy.  We don't allow under-18s to gamble, to buy alcohol or tobacco, or even to have a credit card. In England and Wales, it is not possible to get married until the age of 18.  These and many other legal prohibitions exist because, in law, 16 and 17-year-olds are not adults but children, who need protection and cannot be held fully responsible for their actions.  That is why courts are much more lenient in sentencing minors. By the same token, however, under-18s should not expect to enjoy the same rights as adults. That includes the right to vote.  By dangling this precious right in front of youngsters who cannot yet properly grasp its significance, Sir Keir shows that he cares nothing for their welfare but everything for his own party political interest.  Lowering the voting age is a policy he has inherited from Jeremy Corbyn – the most dangerous man ever to lead a major party in Britain.  And let it never be forgotten that Sir Keir campaigned to put Corbyn into No 10.  It is chilling to imagine the consequences of giving the vote to EU citizens and children. The temptation to promise them favours at the expense of others would be overwhelming.  It's easy to imagine Left-wing politicians lifting border controls to please EU voters. Or wooing teenagers with a bonfire of age restrictions on alcohol, cigarettes, betting and nightclubs.  Britons are rightly proud of having exported liberty under the law to the whole world. But if Labour's rigged the electoral system, it would be a sinister kind of euthanasia for the oldest parliamentary democracy on Earth.  'Dirty and nasty'? The words are yours, Sir Keir."

Benjamin Small, a consultant with the United Nations Development Programme, said it was hard to understand the scale of destruction because of ruptured communications in Rakhine.  ""But with reported 250 kph (155 mph) winds making Cyclone Mocha one of the strongest in Myanmar on record and the worrying images online, it's not looking good,"" Small said on his Twitter account.  In 2008, Cyclone Nargis swept across parts of Myanmar with winds of 240 kph (150 mph), killing nearly 140,000 people.  Since a junta topped a democratically elected government two years ago, Myanmar has been plunged into chaos and a resistance movement is fighting the military on various fronts following a crackdown on protests.  A junta spokesperson did not immediately answer a telephone call from Reuters seeking comment.  The military has imposed internet shutdowns across parts of the country, including some areas in Rakhine and neighbouring Chin state, which was also in Cyclone Mocha's path.  ""There is significant overlap between the shutdown areas and the cyclone's path, which is a major concern, as it's hindering efforts to reach people,"" said digital rights activist Htaike Htaike Aung.  In remote and hilly Chin, which has previously seen heavy fighting between the junta and the resistance, the areas the storm swept through is under a communications blackout since the coup, the Chin Human Rights Organization said.  ""We have not yet been able to establish the extent of the devastation,"" said the group's deputy director Salai Za Uk Ling. ""The storm itself is a trigger for more problems as heavy rains continue and landslides and flooding tend to follow.""
