Zelensky landed by helicopter at Chequers, the British leader’s official country retreat, and was greeted by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. It’s Zelensky’s second trip to the UK since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.  This is the fourth European country Zelenskky has visited in the past few days. He is seeking more aid as Ukraine prepares a long-anticipated spring offensive to retake territory seized by Russia.  Ukraine’s leader made an unannounced visit to Paris on Sunday evening to meet French President Emmanuel Macron, after trips to Germany and Italy, where he met those countries’ leaders and Pope Francis.  A message posted Monday on Zelensky’s official Telegram Channel said: “Today — London. The UK is leading the way when it comes to expanding our capabilities on the ground and in the air. This cooperation will continue today. I will meet my friend Rishi. We will conduct substantive negotiations face-to-face and in delegations.”  The UK has become one of Ukraine’s major military allies, sending Kyiv short-range missiles and Challenger tanks and training 15,000 Ukrainian troops on British soil. Last week Britain announced it had sent Ukraine Storm Shadow cruise missiles, which have a range of more than 250 kilometers (150 miles) — the first known shipment of the weaponry that Kyiv has long sought from its allies.  Sunak’s office said that on Monday Britain will confirm it is giving Ukraine hundreds more air defense missiles, as well as “long-range attack drones” with a range of more than 200 kilometers (120 miles).  “This is a crucial moment in Ukraine’s resistance to a terrible war of aggression they did not choose or provoke,” Sunak said. “They need the sustained support of the international community to defend against the barrage of unrelenting and indiscriminate attacks that have been their daily reality for over a year.  “We must not let them down.”  Sunak will also push allies to deliver more support to Ukraine at a meeting of Group of Seven leaders in Japan later this week, Downing Street said.  As Zelensky visited European capitals, Russia stepped up attacks across Ukraine with drones and missiles over the weekend. On Sunday, Russia shelled two communities in the northern border region of Sumy, the region’s military administration said in a statement on its official Telegram channel. It said 109 explosions were recorded.  Zelensky and Macron met for about three hours on Sunday at the French presidential Elysee Palace — an encounter kept under wraps until shortly before the Ukrainian leader’s arrival in Paris.  Macron’s office said France will supply dozens of light tanks and armored vehicles “in the weeks ahead,” without giving specific numbers. Also promised were more air defense systems, but again details weren’t made public.  More Ukrainians will also be made battle-ready, with France aiming to train about 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers in France this year and nearly 4,000 others in Poland as part of a wider European effort, Macron’s office said.  France has supplied Ukraine with an array of weaponry, include air defense systems, light tanks, howitzers and other arms and equipment and fuel.  France had dispatched a plane to pick up Zelensky in Germany, where he met with Chancellor Olaf Scholz earlier Sunday and discussed his country’s planned counteroffensive.  It was his first visit to Berlin since the start of the invasion and came a day after the German government announced a new package of military aid for Ukraine worth more than 2.7 billion euros ($3 billion), including tanks, anti-aircraft systems and ammunition.  After initially hesitating to provide Ukraine with lethal weapons, Germany has become one of the biggest suppliers of arms to Ukraine, including Leopard 1 and 2 battle tanks, and the sophisticated IRIS-T SLM air defense system. Modern Western hardware is considered crucial if Ukraine is to succeed in its planned counteroffensive.  In the western German city of Aachen, Zelensky also received the prestigious International Charlemagne Prize, awarded to him and the people of Ukraine.  On Saturday. he met Francis and Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni in Rome.  On the European trip, Zelensky said Ukraine will aim to liberate Russian-occupied areas within Ukraine’s internationally recognized borders, and not attack Russian territory.  The Washington Post cited previously undisclosed documents from a trove of US intelligence leaks suggesting that Zelensky has considered trying to capture areas in Russia proper for possible use as bargaining chips in peace negotiations to end the war launched by Moscow in February 2022. This would put him at odds with Western governments that have insisted that weapons they provide must not be used to attack targets in Russia.  Asked about the report, Zelensky said: “We don’t attack Russian territory, we liberate our own legitimate territory.”  “We have neither the time nor the strength (to attack Russia),” he said, according to an official interpreter. “And we also don’t have weapons to spare with which we could do this.”  “We are preparing a counterattack for the illegally occupied areas based on our constitutionally defined legitimate borders, which are recognized internationally,” Zelensky said.  Among areas still occupied by Russia are the Crimean peninsula and parts of eastern Ukraine with mainly Russian-speaking populations."

Awami League lawmaker Naheed on Wednesday filed the case against former army chief and former president Ziaur Rahman, retired Lieutenant Colonel Abu Taher, and 25 others, accusing them of taking part in the killings of her father Colonel Khandker Nazmul Huda, Major General Khaled Mosharraf, and Lieutenant Colonel ATM Haider in Dhaka during a turmoil inside the army on November 7, 1975.  ‘Naheed Izahar Khan filed the case against Ziaur Rahman for her father’s murder for the benefit of the current fascist Awami League regime. There is a political conspiracy behind it. The main reason is to divert domestic and foreign democracy-lovers’ attention from the ongoing anti-fascist movement,’ BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir said at a press conference at the party chairperson’s Gulshan office in Dhaka.  Giving a formal reaction about the case filed 48 years after the killing of Colonel Nazmul Huda in an army mutiny on November 7, 1975, the BNP leader said that Ziaur Rahman rather ordered the protection of Nazmul Huda.  In a written statement, the BNP secretary general mentioned that it was an irony that Naheed Ezaher Khan probably did not even read the book authored by her mother. Her mother, Neelufar Huda, clearly writes in the book titled ‘Colonel Huda O Amar Juddha’, stating the situation in which Colonel Huda was killed.  ‘The testimony of the people present there proves that on that day Ziaur Rahman ordered Colonel Nawazish Ahmed to protect Khaled Mosharraf, Colonel Huda, and Major Haider. On page 134 of the book written by the mother of the plaintiff, Naheed Ezaher Khan, Colonel Taher’s involvement in the murder has clearly emerged,’ Fakhrul said.  Mentioning that Colonel Huda was the brigade commander in Rangpur Cantonment in 1975, Fakhrul said that Colonel Huda was one of the participants in the military coup led by Khaled Mosharraf on November 3, 1975.  ‘He [Colonel Huda] came to Dhaka to lead the coup. It should be noted that the then army chief, Major General Ziaur Rahman, was put under house arrest to seize state power under Khaled Mosharraf. Basically, Khaled Mosharraf and his associates’ political ambitions led to the most brutal prison killings in history,’ he added.  Fakhrul said that the Khaled Mosharraf-led coup created an extremely chaotic environment in the army.  ‘By taking the opportunity, the Revolutionary Soldier Organization and Jasad Gono Bahini, led by Colonel Taher-Inu [Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal president Hasanul Haq Inu], staged a counter-coup, creating an army officer-soldier dispute in the army and participating in a far-reaching domestic-foreign plot to kill brutal army officers. Colonel Nazmul Huda, one of the participants in the Khaled Mosharraf-led coup, is a cruel victim,’ he said."

The latest bit is from an item identified a while ago as a text message from former Energy Secretary Rick Perry to Mark Meadows right after Trump’s defeat. The reality lurking below could be the entire group in the “Trump legal team” who have come to the attention of the the Fulton County GA DA, and who also had been in contact with Mark Meadows. There are many parents before this element of the coup plot becomes an orphan.  Rick now floats an interest in the 2024 POTUS nomination perhaps only because Trump is using it as a defense from coup prosecution, among other crimes. Oops.  x 1.

Acosta asked Perry if he was endorsing Trump in 2024 and Perry hedged, but not because he was thinking about Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL). ""You know, I'm still trying to sort that out for myself. So, you know, he may get to hear me call him names again. Who knows?"" joked Perry. ""It's still early in the process, so I haven't written off that — you know, if you'll recall, I didn't announce for president in 2011 until August. So, we got a lot of time left.""

Multiple people who know Rick Perry confirmed to CNN that the phone number the committee has associated with that text message is Perry’s number.

Now we know what he means.  If Labour wins next year, Starmer plans to rig future elections by giving the vote to millions of EU nationals, plus millions more 16 and 17-year-olds.  The plan would mean that 3.4million EU citizens with 'settled status' would be eligible to vote. Another 2.6million are 'pre-settled' and would doubtless be fast-tracked by Labour.  At a stroke, the electorate would be packed with some 6million foreign voters: More than enough to swing any general election – or a new EU referendum.  Enfranchising under-18s would add another 1.4million voters to the electoral roll.  © Provided by Daily Mail If Labour wins next year, Keir Starmer (pictured) plans to rig future elections by giving the vote to millions of EU nationals, plus millions more 16 and 17-year-olds  The audacity of this expansion of the franchise – the biggest for nearly a century since 1928, when most women got the vote – is exceeded only by its cynicism.  For Sir Keir knows, of course, that the great majority of these extra votes would go to him.  Handing the right to vote to foreigners and mid-teens would tilt the delicate balance of British politics permanently in Labour's favour. We know that Sir Keir would dearly love to reverse Brexit. Several million extra votes would enable him to pull off just such a coup within a few years of taking power.  Labour's plan would also be a giant step towards a one-party state. Many on the Left have looked enviously north of the border, as the SNP lowered the Scottish Parliament's voting age to 16 and extended it to EU citizens too.  Nicola Sturgeon, the former first minister, may now be disgraced and discredited, but – when it comes to her electoral initiatives – Labour is following her example.  Sir Keir's electoral stitch-up is so transparently self-interested that it amounts to political chicanery – 'dirty and nasty' indeed.  Yet the fact that it fails the smell test doesn't mean it could not happen. Most people will instinctively know that Labour's plan is wrong. But why?  Giving votes in general elections to EU residents would be a bad idea even if it were reciprocal. But it is not. Last year the European Court of Justice ruled that UK citizens living in France cannot vote even in local elections, let alone national ones.  © Provided by Daily Mail Labour's plan would also be a giant step towards a one-party state. Pictured: Starmer at a pro-EU rally in 2019  That ruling applies to all other EU countries apart from Ireland because it has a century-old reciprocal agreement on voting with Britain.  Why should the UK give votes to EU nationals who live and work here, when Brussels refuses to do the same for British expats in Europe?  A more fundamental reason for rejecting Labour's plan is that voting is the most basic of democratic rights, which ought to be granted only to British citizens with a permanent stake in the future of this country. My Polish daughter-in-law gained UK citizenship, not just by living here for a decade and mastering English, but by demonstrating her knowledge of and commitment to Britain, by – among other things – making a solemn oath of allegiance to the Crown.  To give the vote to foreigners who have done none of this, but merely have 'settled status', is to devalue the very idea of citizenship.  We all loathe the idea of 'health tourists' – visitors who come here only to take advantage of the NHS. So why create 'voting tourists'? As for giving the vote to 16 and 17-year-olds, this preposterous proposal ignores the fact that they are still adolescents and considered insufficiently mature to enjoy many of the rights and freedoms that over-18s enjoy.  We don't allow under-18s to gamble, to buy alcohol or tobacco, or even to have a credit card. In England and Wales, it is not possible to get married until the age of 18.  These and many other legal prohibitions exist because, in law, 16 and 17-year-olds are not adults but children, who need protection and cannot be held fully responsible for their actions.  That is why courts are much more lenient in sentencing minors. By the same token, however, under-18s should not expect to enjoy the same rights as adults. That includes the right to vote.  By dangling this precious right in front of youngsters who cannot yet properly grasp its significance, Sir Keir shows that he cares nothing for their welfare but everything for his own party political interest.  Lowering the voting age is a policy he has inherited from Jeremy Corbyn – the most dangerous man ever to lead a major party in Britain.  And let it never be forgotten that Sir Keir campaigned to put Corbyn into No 10.  It is chilling to imagine the consequences of giving the vote to EU citizens and children. The temptation to promise them favours at the expense of others would be overwhelming.  It's easy to imagine Left-wing politicians lifting border controls to please EU voters. Or wooing teenagers with a bonfire of age restrictions on alcohol, cigarettes, betting and nightclubs.  Britons are rightly proud of having exported liberty under the law to the whole world. But if Labour's rigged the electoral system, it would be a sinister kind of euthanasia for the oldest parliamentary democracy on Earth.  'Dirty and nasty'? The words are yours, Sir Keir."

""We are using military devices to communicate with them.""

Since a junta topped a democratically elected government two years ago, Myanmar has been plunged into chaos and a resistance movement is fighting the military on various fronts following a crackdown on protests.  A junta spokesperson did not immediately answer a telephone call from Reuters seeking comment.  The military has imposed internet shutdowns across parts of the country, including some areas in Rakhine and neighbouring Chin state, which was also in Cyclone Mocha's path.
