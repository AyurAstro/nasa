The latest whistle comes from Junmoni’s mother where she has accused the top brass of Nagaon police of “murdering” her daughter as the latter ferreted out their plans of a possible criminal conspiracy.  “The SP and DSP….all are involved in something big and Junmoni might have come to know about their malicious intentions, that is why they killed her!,” Junmoni’s weeping mother said.  She also claimed that the team of police led by Nagaon SP had raided her residence on an ill-fated night and seized more than Rs 1 lakh, apart from a small amount of jewelry. During the raid, she said that a police official allegedly seized her phone and switched it off before deleting several contacts and phone numbers from it.  The police had also threatened her to not speak anything in front of the media, Junmoni’s mother further claimed.  The raid, it’s now said, was conducted on the basis of a complaint lodged against Junmoni at Lakhimpur Police Station in which she has been accused of being involved in an extortion case.  She informed that the police team had arrived at her residence late at night, possibly after the tragic car crash that claimed Junmoni’s life.  Further, Junmoni’s mother claimed that the post-mortem of the deceased cop was carried out without her consent. This raises suspicion as Junmoni’s body had several injury marks indicating that she was assaulted with sticks or rods before her untimely death, her mother said.  In light of such anomalies, the family of the deceased cop has now sought the intervention of Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma into what is being described as a case of ‘premeditated murder’.  Earlier, an informant of SI Junmoni, Hasina Begum, who provided information against a fake gold nexus to her, also claimed that the accident was a premeditated murder. She has bought in serious allegations against the police asserting that Junmoni Rabha was innocent and that the case lodged against her was baseless.  “She has been killed and that the IC of Naoboicha police out post Sanjib Bora, is involved in the whole incident since he had demanded Rs 6 lakh from Junmoni Rabha to settle the police complaint lodged against her by an arrested accused of the fake gold case,” Hasina Begum told News Live.  Junmoni Rabha, who was embroiled in various controversies last year, died in a road accident at Kaliabor in Assam’s Nagaon district on Monday night. The vehicle in which Rabha was travelling in, reportedly collided with an oncoming container truck bearing registration number ‘UP 78UT 4518’ near Sarubhagia village on National Highway 37. Sources said that the vehicle was completely crushed in the accident as the impact was huge.  Rabha was a SI at Morakolong police station in Nagaon who made headlines last year for various controversies she was embroiled in – including corruption, criminal conspiracy, and cheating, for which was also arrested. She was later granted bail by a session’s court.  Junmoni’s death has raised several questions of whether it was murder, suicide or just an accident that turned fatal. Due to this, Director General of Police (DGP) GP Singh handed over the case to CID.  According to DGP Singh, a case was registered against Junmoni Rabha at the North Lakhimpur Police Station on May 15, a day before her death where she was named as an accused. Both the cases including the FIR lodged against Rabha and her tragic death will now be investigated by the CID, informed GP Singh."

The victim's mother, Jessica Weaver, has condemned what she described as the inadequate response of the park lifeguards, claiming that their lack of preparation is partially to blame for the tragedy.  Trigger warning: This article concerns the accidental death of a child, the reader's discretion is advised  The Camp Cohen Water Park is managed by the City of El Paso, according to The El Paso Times. City officials have refused to comment on the death of Anthony Malave, stating that the case is currently under investigation. The Camp Cohen Water Park, one of the city's four water parks, was initially opened in 2021. It was closed for an undisclosed period before May 13. The day of the tragedy was labeled a ""soft opening"" event.  Anthony Malave's funeral took place on May 15, 2023  As reported by CBS, on Saturday, Jessica Weaver attended the soft opening of Camp Cohen with Anthony Malave. Weaver told reporters that the accident occurred at approximately 5 pm when Malave was found unresponsive in a pool. Fox noted that the EMS was called at 5:09 pm and arrived at 5:14 pm.  Jessica Weaver said that upon their arrival, first responders attempted to use CPR equipment on Anthony Malave. However, they faced technical difficulties. Weaver claimed that it was clear the lifeguards were not well trained.  Weaver said:  “They weren’t ready to switch out equipment if one wasn’t working properly for this child, they didn’t know do hands on mouth to mouth CPR, they didn’t even say hey this isn’t working, let’s do this, it was like let’s keep going with what we have and see the outcome.""  She continued:  “They kept saying the same thing that it’s not sealing properly around his mouth so he’s not getting the oxygen he needed, but never was there a switch of hey we got another one, here’s another piece of equipment, here let’s try this, it was just traumatizing to watch. ""  Jessica Weaver told CBS reporters that she does not blame the lifeguards but hopes that the city will provide them with adequate training in the future. She added that many of the lifeguards were young, describing them as ""children saving children.""  Busy Bee🐝 @BumbleStarss The whole situation of the little boy who drowned at Camp Cohen this past weekend is so heartbreaking.    But I’m glad people are calling out the mom for her lack of reaction/concern for it. The whole situation of the little boy who drowned at Camp Cohen this past weekend is so heartbreaking. But I’m glad people are calling out the mom for her lack of reaction/concern for it.  In order to stop further drownings at the city's water parks, Jessica Weaver told reporters from various media sites that she is committed to speaking out against the inadequate safety responses. In a message delivered during an ABC 7 interview, she reminded parents to keep an eye on their children at the pool and to make sure that they were wearing floating devices.  The funeral of Anthony Malave was held on May 15, 2023. His obituary stated that he left behind a mother and a pair of grandparents.  Drowning rates in America  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are approximately 4000 fatal unintentional drownings in America a year and 8000 nonfatal drownings. The Red Cross noted that around 10 people die from drowning in America each day.  Studies show that for children between the ages of 1 and 4, drowning is the most common cause of death. US government sites state that to prevent drowning, parents should closely supervise children who are in the pool and implement a buddy system so that swimmers can look after one another in case of an emergency.

The iCarly actress was on tour for her debut album, Sparks Fly, in August of that year when her tour bus crashed into a semi-truck en route to Kansas. As per research done on internet trends, several netizens are once again taking keen interest in the actress' older accident.  This could be because a video of the actress narrating the accident has gone viral on TikTok, racking up over 142 thousand views and counting.  The TikTok clip of Cosgrove talking about the accident has amassed over 100,000 views (Image via TikTok/@mirandacosgroveupdates)  Miranda Cosgrove's tour bus smashed into a semi-truck en route to Kansas  Miranda Cosgrove was at the peak of her popularity in 2011.  Nickelodeon's iCarly was running successfully, the star had just released her debut album, Sparks Fly, and she toured the United States for her debut solo tour, The Dancing Crazy Tour.  Once Cosgrove released her second LP, High Maintenance, she decided to extend the Dancing Crazy tour into the summer.  cosgrover forever @king_cosgrover    #Cosgroversnation  #Mirandaourqueen  #generationcosgrovers  #Cosgoversreligion The best tour of the world Dancing crazy tour, @mirandacosgrove is the best. she make proyects so greats, so wonderful, she is the best.

A pity of that accident, that driver was so stupid#Cosgroversnation #Mirandaourqueen#generationcosgrovers#Cosgoversreligion https://t.co/GQYISKpW8Z  It was during the extended, Dancing Crazy Summer Tour that Miranda Cosgrove's tour bus smashed into a semi-truck in Illinois. The actress was en route to Kansas after a concert at the Fraze. Instead of swerving to avoid the semi, the tour bus driver hit the brakes, which resulted in the accident.  The accident left the actress and singer with a broken ankle that required surgery. Her mother also suffered concussions. The bus driver was severely injured and had to be airlifted to the hospital. Reports indicate that his arm was sliced right through and required 45 stitches.  ""I like, flew out of the bed and I hit the wall"": Miranda Cosgrove  The viral clip originated from EP #31 of Whitney Cummings' Good For You Podcast, where Miranda Cosgrove appeared as a guest. The actress labeled her accident as a ""Crazy weird thing that happened"" and explained that getting into a car accident was now a big fear of hers:  ""Especially if you're sleeping in a car or for a while after it happened, I would like, wake up in the night because I'd like, remember because I heard a big sound when the tour bus ran into another car.""  Miranda Cosgrove subsequently elaborated on how wearing UGG boots protected her leg from further damage:  ""I like, flew out of the bed and I hit the wall, so my foot like, hit the wall and the UGGs protected it.""  Miranda also had a funny story about her involvement in her mom's concussion. In the accident, a bookcase fell on top of the actress, and she disorientedly threw it off of her, only for it to inadvertently land on her mother. Her mother later suffered a concussion and was knocked out for the entire ordeal.  Miranda Cosgrove's surgeon was clueless about a hole in her foot  In October 2021, the actress appeared in actor Sean Hayes' and Dr. Priyanka Wali's podcast, Hypocondriactor, where she spoke about the extent of her injuries. Cosgrove remembered being relatively calm after the accident after being ensured that her injuries were treatable:  ""I wasn't really freaking out that much I don't know if it's just, you know, what people do when something traumatic happens you're kind of calm for once.""  When the then 20-year-old woke up after the surgery and got rid of her cast, she recalled seeing a hole between her ankle and her knee. She likened its size to that of the top of an expo marker. She said that it eventually healed, but at the time, it looked like someone cut a hole through her foot.  Dr. Priyanka Wali presented a few possibilities for the presence of the hole. Her first guess was that it was related to the insertion of a surgical rod at the time of the operation, but she acknowledged that if that were true, the doctors would know. Cosgrave explained that the medical staff were clueless about what it was:  ""The surgeon was like..., I wasn't in there when that happened, if we had something to do with it, I wasn't in, there. It must've been after I left the room.""  The only answer she got was from her physical therapist, who clarified that sometimes during surgery, it was necessary to make a hole to drain excess blood that flows toward the foot. Dr. Wali said she wasn't familiar with the process but wouldn't rule that out.  Poll : 0 votes"

What You Need To Know Researchers at North Carolina State University developed a complex model to improve how quickly first responders get to car accidents    In computational testing, the model outperformed the existing techniques    This research can help agencies for long-term planning and on a day-to-day basis  Asya Atik and Dr. Leila Hajibabi are hoping their research will improve how quickly first responders, like police and EMTs, can respond to a car accident.  They developed a model that can help authorities figure out where to put first responder infrastructure, and determine which responders are best placed to reach an accident quicker.  The Ph.D. candidate, Atik, said she really wanted to work on something that would make a difference in the community.  “I personally am educated on optimization and engineering tools,” Atik said. “I’m also getting my Ph.D. in transportation systems, so I was looking into emergency response type of fields. I also want to work on something that I know has a value that will help people.”  Atik said during their research, they looked at statistics in the United States and realized quickly there were a lot of traffic accidents happening nationwide. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, more than five million traffic accidents were reported by police in the United States in 2020; and these accidents led to over 38,000 lives lost.  “It’s important to save lives and of course if there is an accident on the road, you clear the roadway from the accident as quickly as possible to make sure you’re avoiding secondary accounts and maintaining the safety on the roadways,” Hajibabi, assistant professor at NCSU, said.  Through their research, they said shorter response times could help avoid some of these impacts. Using real world data, they developed a model that maximizes the coverage area and minimizes the amount of time it would take to reach accident sites. They factored in things like fleet size, resources available to first responders and dispatching locations.  They said their model did better than existing models in terms of improving response times, regardless of the size of the traffic problem they were responding to. They’re hoping that this work helps inform agencies to make decisions when responding to these emergencies.  To test the model, researchers used data collected by the North Carolina Department of Transportation looking at more than 10,000 traffic incidents that happened in over 10,000 different location in Raleigh."

Britain's Princess Diana(AP/ File photo)  On her last day, Princess Diana was with her partner at the time, 42-year-old Dodi Fayed, a film producer and son of billionaire Harrod's owner Mohamed Al Fayed, as Christopher Andersen recounted in the book “The Day Diana Died.”  The couple had come to Paris from Sardinia on August 30, 1997, after spending more than a week together around the Mediterranean. When they left Dodi Fayed’s Paris apartment in a Mercedes-Benz driven by Henri Paul- deputy head of security at the Ritz- they were accompanied by bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones.  When their car entered the Pont de L’Alma tunnel, Paul lost control of the vehicle after which the vehicle collided into the tunnel’s 13th pillar, resulting in a devastating collision that killed both Paul and Dodi Fayed at the scene.  Princess Diana remained alive as first responders arrived on the scene of the crash.  “We took her out of a car, put her on a stretcher, and at that moment the doctor said she was in cardiac arrest. So we gave her CPR, and after 20 seconds she regained consciousness and we transferred her to the ambulance,"" a first responder had then said as per Associated Press.  The car crash occurred as per royal expert Christopher Anderson owing to a number of photographers pursuing the Mercedes-Benz on motorcycles. After chasing after the car, the paparazzi reportedly remained at the scene of the accident, photographing Diana in her final moments.  “I think one of the hardest things to come to terms with is the fact that the people that chased her into the tunnel were the same people that were taking photographs of her while she was still dying on the back seat of the car,” Prince Harry told BBC.  “William and I know that.

Andhure said a major accident was averted as he was driving at a moderate speed.“The incident happened when some of the passengers were about to deboard at Shevalwadi. I was driving at moderate speed and slowed down further as some passengers were waiting to get off. The passengers had asked me stop a little fruther from the designated spot. I looked in the rear-view mirror only to find a rear wheel was about to come off. I slowed down further just before two wheels came off. I somehow stopped it a at a safe point before asking all passengers to get off. My habit of driving at moderate speeds paid off,” Andhure, who is currently posted in Parel depot and has been a MSRTC employee for the past 10 years, told TOI.Commuters have been up in arms against the state transport utility over faulty vehicles leaving its management in damage control mode. However, Shekhar Channe, the vice chairman and managing director of MSRTC called the incident a minor one. “In Mumbai, no buses are allowed to ply after they have operated for eight years. It was not an old bus. There has been a lapse in the maintained or spare parts are faulty. We are investigating the matter. It is unusual for wheels to come off the bus,” he said.Vipul Jain, a regular MSRTC commuter, said that travelling in the buses has become scary. “The Shivshahi buses are in a shambles and other buses have serious faults. Most drivers are rash leading to accidents. The assurance that MSRTC buses will provide safe rides, is long gone, hence people tend to spend more money and opt for private buses,” he said.Meanwhile, the MSRTC will start operations of five Shivai e-buses between Pune and Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar from Thursday."

An MRT train then collided with the crane jib, resulting in one death and 10 injuries.  This accident has caused great public concern. While a preliminary investigation is under way, the Taichung City Government has ordered that work be suspended on nine construction projects, including the one on which the crane was working, run by Highwealth Construction Corp. The city is also investigating the construction companies involved.  The domino theory of accident causation proposed by US industrial safety pioneer Herbert Heinrich says that accidents are often the result of a domino-like series of faults, in which one act of negligence causes more dominoes to fall, eventually causing an accident to occur.  Three such dominos can be seen in last week’s accident, namely failures in the construction company’s outsourcing management, human operations and the Taichung MRT’s emergency response system.  First, the construction firm failed to provide adequate safety measures to ensure the safety of its workers and nearby pedestrians. Second, there was carelessness on the part of the workers. Third, Taichung Mass Rapid Transit Corp’s emergency response system failed to promptly detect and respond to the danger, thus acting as the final domino.  To prevent similar accidents from happening again, the government should implement the following suggestions.  First, bolster its supervision of the construction industry to ensure that construction firms abide by safety regulations and provide adequate safety measures.  Second, enhance workers’ awareness of industrial safety and strictly supervise their operation of machinery.  Third, increase supervision of rapid transit companies to ensure that they effectively inspect, maintain and repair their emergency response systems to ensure passenger safety.  With regard to preventing accidents in the construction industry, the government should respond with measures that go to the source of the problem. The government and relevant departments should bolster their supervision of the construction industry and enforcement of related laws, requiring construction companies and their contractors to strictly abide by regulations to ensure the safety of workers and the surrounding environment.  The government must also increase its supervision of rapid transport companies, requiring them to ensure passenger safety by properly inspecting and maintaining their emergency response systems.  In addition to government supervision, all parties involved in the construction industry must conscientiously perform their duties with regard to safety management by giving their workers a safe working environment and equipment, and ensuring that their employees are properly trained and aware of safety rules.  As for the workers themselves, they must also consciously abide by safety regulations and operating procedures, thus ensuring their own safety and the safety of others.  Accidents in the construction industry have an immeasurable effect on society. The government must protect the health and safety of workers and the public by uncovering the root causes of accidents.  Only in this way can the construction industry continue to develop and make greater social and economic contributions.  Jean Liu is a podcast executive producer.  Translated by Julian Clegg"

On Tuesday evening, the licensed practical nurse, 36, and spouse, who retired from the Marine Corps for medical reasons in 2017, shared that their child, who had been hospitalized with serious injuries' over the weekend, was 'doing well and home now.'  'I need to focus all my love and attention on their healing. I'll pop in here and there, but will be lagging on my messages for a bit,' Briana, who runs the Instagram account The Culbersons, wrote to her more than 276,000 Instagram followers.  The couple, who share Troy, 11, Owen, eight, Hank, three, and one-year-old Cora, have not revealed any additional information about the incident.  In the comment section of a video of Hank, uploaded on Wednesday, however, when someone asked how Hank was doing after his fall, Ryan replied that he was 'under concussion protocol, but doing great.'  Distressing: Vicki Gunvalson's daughter Briana Culberson and her husband Ryan revealed that one of their four children 'suffered a terrible accident on Mother's Day'  Scary weekend: On Tuesday evening, the licensed practical nurse, 36, and spouse, who retired from the Marine Corps for medical reasons in 2017, shared that their child, who had been hospitalized with serious injuries' over the weekend, was 'doing well and home now'  Gunvalson has not publicly commented on her grandson's injuries, but did share a card from four of her grandchildren, who she said she missed 'terribly.'  In March, the family moved from to Oklahoma from their home of several years in Illinois to raise their little ones in a 'slower paced country setting.'  In April, when praised for 'present and appreciative' she is with her brood in the comment section of one of her Instagram posts, Briana said she and Ryan had 'through a lot, together and individually.'  'We’ve had a lot of things happen that have made us evaluate what’s important to us and how we want to raise our kids. It hasn’t always been pretty but we’ve gotten to such a place of peace with our marriage and we changed our whole lives for our kids,' she explained of her priorities.  As for how they were enjoying their new residence, nestled between farms with horses and a treehouse in their backyard, the mother-of-three said the new setting has been 'so peaceful' and they were all 'loving it.'  Last year, Briana and Ryan welcomed their baby girl named Cora Rose, who they called a 'beautiful healthy blessing.'  She's maintains a mostly private life away from social media aside from her keto-inspired page where she gives followers updates on her day-to-day food choices on the mostly no-carb lifestyle.  Briana found fame at a young age as the daughter of the real OG from the OC, Vicki Gunvalson, who starred on the Real Housewives of Orange County from its inception in 2006 through 2019 when she left the show for good.  'I need to focus all my love and attention on their healing. I'll pop in here and there, but will be lagging on my messages for a bit,' Briana, who runs the Instagram account The Culbersons, wrote to her more than 276,000 Instagram followers  Fresh start: In March, the family moved from to Oklahoma from their home of several years in Illinois to raise their little ones in a 'slower paced country setting'  She celebrated her 12-year wedding anniversary with Ryan in October.  Prior to living in Oklahoma and Illinois, they previously resided in North Carolina for years.  Earlier this month, she opened up about knowing since she was 'old enough to remember' that she 'wanted to be a nurse.'  'My mom had health problems and many surgeries when I was a child. I always felt comfortable at the hospitals and taking care of her at home. That was easy, I knew I wanted to help people and it is the purpose for my life. I started working in the ER at 18 years old and graduated with my bachelors of science in nursing right after I turned 22. I spent 17 years in the ER and loved it, I even miss it daily,' she wrote on her Instagram account.  Beloved grandma: Gunvalson has not publicly commented on her grandson's injuries, but did share a card from four of her grandchildren, who she said she missed 'terribly'  Back in 2017, Briana was left 'fighting for her life' after surgeons made a mistake and operated on her with a dirty scalpel while performing a surgery to treat her lupus.  'It almost killed my daughter,' Vicki told People, at the time. '[The scalpel was infected] with feces from a previous surgery that day they put inside her body.'  The reality star stressed: ''So, not good, she almost lost her leg. She almost died and all this stuff.'  In 2018, she was hospitalized again and tried the keto diet with her husband to see if it would help her illness.  And after a year on the diet, she lost 45 pounds."

(KGNS) - Two weeks ago, a young man recently lost his life after a car accident on Loop 20 and Havana Drive.  It’s the latest incident that has city officials looking for ways to prevent more vehicle fatalities from happening at the same location.  Loop 20 is a busy road that gets drivers from one end of Laredo to another but over the years, it has become a hot spot for some of the deadliest car accidents.  From motorcyclists crashing into a ditch to most recently a rollover that claimed the life of a 22-year-old.  With so many accidents happening back-to-back, District Six councilmember Dr. Tyler king believes now is the time to act.  “I asked for a long-term plan to address this, and with city and traffic and police there’s a two prone approach that you got to fix an issue, but you also have to fix the speeding as well,” said Dr. King.  According to Dr. King the plan is a two-phase approach.  “Create a concrete barrier to replace those flimsy poles that do little to nothing, from International to approximately Shiloh. On top of that, an unofficial plan from TxDOT at this time is to narrow the loop in that eastward-eastbound section to a two lane around that shortest curve,” said Dr. King.  It is the councilmember’s hope that these measures could help reduce the number of accidents in the area.  Now, as an added layer of protection, Investigator Joe Baeza with the Laredo Police Deparment said they have increased police presence following the recent accidents.  “I think what people do really need to know is that what they need to realize is that we augmented the enforcement of the area quite a bit,” said Baeza.  Baeza adds that the issue also requires the help of the community.  “They have to do their part, if everybody were to travel the posting speed limit its almost very hard to get into any kind of trouble,” said Baeza.  So the next time you drive through Loop 20, officials encourage you to remain alert and follow the speed limit so that you get home to your loved ones safe and sound.  According to TxDOT, the concrete barrier installation project will begin in 2024.  For more headlines. click here.  Copyright 2023 KGNS. All rights reserved."

According to Cena, 46, the opportunity to be in the highly anticipated film came in the form of a chance encounter with “Barbie” actress Margot Robbie, 32, who was filming her movie across the street from his latest “Fast & Furious” installment.  “It was a happy accident, and I think ‘Barbie’ and ‘Fast X’ share a lot of parallels,” Cena said during the “Today” interview. “Their cast list is amazing. The ‘Barbie’ cast list is amazing. The ‘Fast X’ cast list is amazing. It was a chance maybe to [say], ‘Hey, would you guys be willing to have me if I could do something?’ “  “Fast X” star John Cena said that he told “Barbie” lead Margot Robbie he “would do, pretty much, whatever you guys need” to land a part in the movie. TODAY with Hoda & Jenna  Cena said that he told Robbie he “would do, pretty much, whatever you guys need ’cause I really enjoy the movie.”  Fortunately for the athlete, his “Suicide Squad” co-star made “a lot of the decisions” regarding casting and was later asked if he would be a merman.  The Post reached out to Cena and Robbie for comment.  Fortunately for the WWE icon, his “Suicide Squad” co-star made “a lot of the decisions” regarding casting and was later asked if he would be a merman. ©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection  When pressed by host Hoda Kotb, Cena recalled the experience of being on the film’s set as “surreal.”  “Honestly, I think people are going to have a lot of fun watching this,” he added. “I think it’s going to take a lot of people by surprise. [It’s] a very interesting take on everything but I was super lucky and it’s tremendously surreal.”  The “Playing with Fire” star revealed last week that his official audition for the summer flick initially did not go well.  “I tried and got rejected,” Cena said on SiriusXM’s “Pop Culture Spotlight” with Jessica Shaw. “They were putting out open casting for the movie. I get it, I wasn’t a piece for the puzzle.”  “Barbie” is set to party its way into theaters July 21. ©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection  “I think a lot of times people think, ‘Oh, he wouldn’t do that,’ ” continued Cena. “I don’t think there are any small parts. A chance is a chance. An opportunity to show your skill or develop a new skill, that’s fantastic. That’s why I want to do all this stuff, so I think once they realized I would just be grateful to be involved, they were like, ‘Yeah, you can do this.’ “  Cena will flip his fin alongside pop star Dua Lipa who was revealed to be playing the mermaid version of the popular Mattel doll.  Gerwig’s film has spawned unending waves of social media frenzy.  In April, the film dropped a full trailer featuring the entire cast as well character posters for all the different versions of Barbie.

The account claimed in the caption that it was an animated demonstration of a real incident that took place in 2016.  It further stated that the video of the incident was taken in Florida, where a 34-year-old person named Courtney Winston ran over a group of college students in an unfortunate accident, and none of the victims survived the impact of the hit.  Now TikTok users were confused as they tried to decipher whether or not the claim was true. Such notorious claims are not unusual on social media, as many accounts on different social media platforms are dedicated to spreading hoaxes and false and deceptive claims to baffle viewers.  However, no car accident involving that name and a group of college students was reported in December 2016. There is no other evidence supporting the supposed incident either.  TikTok users react to Courtney Winston car accident claim  The animated clip shared by @rbxleak is only a couple of seconds long, where a car is shown driving down a road. It’s displayed from a first-person perspective, like racing games. Then suddenly, the car collides with a group of people trying to cross the road, and the victims are seen immediately flown across the road. A loud screeching of a female is heard.  Here's how some people on TikTok reacted to the video:  TikTok users react to animated Courtney Winston car accident video.

An investigation determined Herwig was the one who hit the bicyclist while driving a pickup. When authorities found Herwig’s pickup, they allegedly found damage on the front of the vehicle that matched parts found at the scene of the accident.  According to court documents, Herwig told officers that he knew he hit something, but he wasn’t sure what it was.

(WXIX) - The family of a Northern Kentucky man is in despair after their loved one was removed from life support three months after a tragic farm accident.  Larry Posey, 74, passed on Mother’s Day from injuries he suffered after he was run over by a tractor while working on a farm along Duncan Road in Crittenden.  “I’m dead inside,” said Tracey Deleon, Posey’s daughter. “I’m dying right now. It’s like, killing me.”  Deleon is in gut-wrenching pain without her father.  “Every night I’m on my back porch, sitting away from the kids so they don’t see the emotions, until 3 a.m. I’m crying out on the porch by myself,” Deleon said.  The accident happened on Feb. 13 as Posey was helping a friend repair a tractor on the farm he owns. Deleon says later that evening, they got the call.  “There were a couple of different stories. First, it was told that once the filter was put on, the tractor jumped out of gear and ran over him,” she said “Then another story was told that he was under it... We’re not sure exactly which of those stories is the truth.”  UC Air Care flew her father to the University of Cincinnati Medical Center with a fractured skull, fractured ribs and a punctured lung. He was placed on life support and eventually transferred to The Christ Hospital, where he would die three months later.  “With him gone, that leaves us with nothing,” Deleon said. “I call his cell phone just to hear his voice on his voicemail. I’m lost.”  She says the work her father was doing that day was typical of the man renowned locally as a handyman who didn’t mind getting his hands dirty and bending over backward for those who needed him.  “He would come up and help on the farm to not be sitting,” she said. “He would cut the grass, he would take care of the cows, and he would take care of the horses... He was a great person. The best.”  Deleon says Posey was a retired coal miner and a major financial provider for the family. Now she’s hopeful an online fundraiser created in his honor will raise enough to cover his funeral expenses.  “My dad was amazing. He was amazing. He taught me everything I need to know about car work. He was always there for me. Always there for me,” she said “He deserves to be buried with dignity and respect. No matter what I have to do.”  The family is working with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to determine what exactly happened.  See a spelling or grammar error in our story?

The said road is known often called ‘killer road’ due to its poor condition, particularly within the limits of the Municipal Councils of Mandi Gobindgarh and Amloh.  The road has been playing havoc with the lives of the public and accidents here have become a routine.  The deceased has been identified as Jaswinder Singh of Shanti Nagar. He was working as a peon at the Motia Khan branch of Union Bank. As per the police, the deceased was returning home after duty. As he reached near a restaurant on the Amloh road, a speeding truck hit his scooter. Jaswinder fell on the ground and was crushed by the truck. He died on the spot.  The Mandi Gobindgarh-Nabha road, which connects the area with Sangrur and Malwa, has been in a poor condition since long. Potholes and plying of trucks loaded with heavy iron material on the road not only cause great inconvenience to the commuters but also poses a threat to their lives. Trucks loaded with iron often overturn due to the potholes.  Harpreet Singh Prince, president of the Mandi Gobindgarh Municipal Council said earlier there was a toll plaza on the road, but the contractor shut it and left the road at the mercy of the authorities. Since then, neither the municipal councils nor the government initiated the repair work of the road, he said.  During the Assembly elections, the sitting AAP MLA had promised that it would be his priority to get the road repaired if his party came to power. But nothing has been done so far even though the party has completed more than one year in power.  The condition of the road worsened after it was dug up for laying sewerage lines. Trucks carrying iron material are parked on the roadside, leading to snarl-ups and causing accidents.  The residents have been demanding the repairing of the road for long, but no one has paid any heed to their demands.

(WIAT) — On Wednesday, UAB honored trauma survivors, their families and the doctors that treated them.  Wil Raines is a survivor who said he’s alive today and able to live out his dream of being a father because of the care from trauma specialists at UAB.  Raines is a familiar face here at CBS 42. As a photojournalist, he is an integral part of our team, capturing the heart of stories through the camera lens but it’s his heart that’s taking center stage.  Raines is a car accident survivor and thanks to doctors at UAB’s Trauma Center, he is able to share his story of survival.  “Going across four lanes of traffic changed the rest of my life,” Raines said.  It was the day after Christmas, 1997 when young Raines’ life flashed before his eyes.  “People at the Chevron said ‘Man, there was a bag that went flying out that car.’ [In reality] that was me,” Raines said.  He had hopped in his friend’s Bronco. They were meeting friends at the gas station down the street when they got in a car accident.  “I always wear my seatbelt. But you know, you jump in the car and run across the street, run a mile down the street go see a friend. You don’t think about it. I didn’t think about it,” Raines said.  A car crashed into them causing the Bronco to flip three times throwing Raines out of the car.  “Everything turned white, and it was completely quiet. Growing up as a person of faith I knew exactly what it was. I wasn’t scared,” Raines said.  The crash happened in Prattville, miles from UAB’s Trauma Center. He had a broken arm, collapsed lung and a stage-five laceration on his liver, causing him to bleed out.  “I saw my mom and my dad and the last thing I said to them for a few weeks was pray for me,” Raines said.  His family doctor, Dr. Charles Cloutier knew Raines’ chances of survival were running out. It was a cold, rainy December night and Cloutier said the medivac was grounded because of the weather. He pulled some strings and got an ambulance from Prattville to take Raines to Birmingham. He rode with him the entire way giving him blood and fluids along the way.  “We got him to UAB about 4 a.m. and UAB took over. They were professional, excellent. We felt very comfortable with Wil being here at UAB. It’s a time that’s embedded in your brain and will not go away. It was a traumatic event for everyone involved. Wil was a trooper,” Dr. Cloutier said.  Thankfully the surgeries were a success. It was the beginning of a long road to recovery. He had been given a second chance at life.  “If it weren’t for them, I wouldn’t have my son. If it weren’t for them, I wouldn’t be standing here talking to y’all,” Raines said.  And this Wednesday, Raines got to thank that doctor in person at UAB’s Trauma Survivors’ Day.  “I just want to give him a hug. I was talking to my mom, and I said what can I get him. He’s the one that saved my life,” Raines said.  Raines said it’s because of doctors like Dr. Cloutier and centers like UAB’s Trauma Center that so many people get to live a long and healthy life."

On Friday, May 12, 30-year-old Scotty Hogg and his girlfriend 34-year-old Kaitlyn Brann were climbing Goodro’s Wall in Big Cottonwood Canyon when a large rock on the route gave way, causing both the climbers to fall. Brann was killed in the accident, and Hogg was transported to the hospital by helicopter with serious injuries.  The fundraiser was organized by Cory Lamkins, a friend of Hogg’s. Lamkins and Hogg met in 2017 while they were stationed in Iraq serving in the Army. Lamkins described Hogg as an avid outdoor enthusiast and a very dependable friend.  “He loves being outdoors and in nature,” Lamkins said. “If you call and you need something, he will help whether it’s in person or whether he spends all his days calling anybody he knows that can help you out closer to you. He’s always a guy that if you need him, he’s there.”  Although Lamkins had not met Brann in person, he said that he had spoken to her on the phone several times during calls with Hogg.  “I did not get to meet her in person, sadly, but I will say anybody that had the energy to love Scott must have been a pretty incredible person, because he’s all go all the time,” Lamkins said.  Hogg is still in the hospital where he is working with physical therapists to regain mobility after the accident.  “He’s got a long road ahead of him to fully recover,” Lamkins said. “Just like anybody who lost someone days ago, you know, he’s mentally going through your grinder, but all the love and support it’s really been helping him stay out of dark times.”  At the time of this article $9,030 had been donated out of the GoFundMe’s $20,000 goal. According to Lamkins, all donated funds that surpass the $20,000 goal will be donated to Brann’s family to help cover funeral expenses."

In a unanimous per curiam opinion, the Supreme Court ruled the Ohio Industrial Commission did not completely analyze the death benefits law, but instead focused only on whether Amanda Carpenter was Christopher McDonald’s wife. An unmarried person in a relationship with the deceased is not “presumed” to be entitled to death benefits under the law, but a case-by-case inquiry needs to be made under such circumstances.  The Court vacated the industrial commission’s order and directed it to determine if Carpenter is entitled to death benefits as a “member of McDonald’s family.”  Click to Expand  Benefit Denial Contested  In 2019, McDonald died in a ditch collapse. Carpenter, the mother of McDonald’s two minor children, applied to the Bureau of Workers’ Compensation for death benefits on behalf of the children and herself.  Carpenter identified herself as McDonald’s fiancée. She provided a sworn statement that she and McDonald had been in a relationship for 11 years and jointly owned property. The two were jointly responsible for mortgage and vehicle lease payments and credit card debts. Each had life insurance policies naming the other as the sole beneficiary. Carpenter indicated she worked part-time, and McDonald was the primary financial support for her and their two children. She added that they “had every intention of being married if not for this accident.”  A district hearing officer awarded benefits to the children, but not to Carpenter. She appealed and a staff hearing officer awarded her death benefits as well. The order was then appealed to the industrial commission, which vacated the decision of its staff hearing officer and denied Carpenter death benefits.  The commission determined Carpenter was not dependent on McDonald as a surviving spouse because they were never married and they could not be considered married under common law because Ohio abolished common-law marriage in 1991. The commission also stated that case law has not extended the benefit to “an unmarried person in a relationship” with the deceased, as Carpenter suggested.  Carpenter requested a writ of mandamus from the Tenth District Court of Appeals ordering the industrial commission to reverse its decision and award her death benefits. The Tenth District did so, and the industrial commission appealed the decision to the Supreme Court.  Supreme Court Analyzed Death Benefit Law  Payment of death benefits to the dependents of a worker who died on the job is governed by R.C. 4123.59(D), the opinion explained. The law explains that a surviving spouse living with the employee at the time of death is presumed to be wholly dependent on the deceased and entitled to death benefits.  The law says a “member of the family” may be a “prospective dependent” if the person also “bears to the deceased employee the relation of surviving spouse, lineal descendant, ancestor, or brother or sister.” The industrial commission may take any facts into consideration that indicate the person’s prospective dependency.  In all other cases, the commission must decide “in accordance with the facts in each particular case” if the person is “a member of the family of the deceased employee, or bears to the deceased employee the relation of surviving spouse, lineal descendant, ancestor, or brother or sister.”  The Court stated this last paragraph of the law applies to claims brought by a person not presumed to be a dependent of the employee, and may even apply to a surviving spouse if the spouse was not living with the employee at the time of death.  The opinion stated that the last paragraph of R.C. 4123.59(D) provides two potential categories of dependents. One is a member of the family of the deceased employee. The second is a person who “bears to the deceased employee the relation of surviving spouse, lineal descendant, ancestor, or brother or sister.” Because the sentence contains an “or,” a person does not have to be married to the deceased employee to be a member of the family, the Court ruled.  The law indicates “any” person may be eligible for benefits if that person is determined to be “a member of the family,” the opinion stated. Ohio workers’ compensation laws do not define “member of the family.” When denying Carpenter benefits, the commission did not consider or determine whether she was a member of McDonald’s family, the opinion stated.  The commission argued that for more than 80 years, the law in Ohio required a legal marriage before it was required to pay death benefits. The opinion noted the commission used cases from 1922 and 1957 to support its argument.  The Court pointed to more recent cases in which stepchildren who were not formally adopted, but lived with and were dependent on the deceased employee, were considered members of the family and were awarded death benefits.  The opinion stated the commission could consider that an unmarried person in a relationship with the deceased is a member of the family. The Court pointed to definitions in Black’s Law Dictionary that could include Carpenter. For instance, one definition of “family” in the law dictionary is “a group consisting of parents and their children,” the opinion noted. Another is “a group of people who live together and usu[ally] have a shared commitment to a domestic relationship.”  “Accordingly — as these definitions show — it is very well possible that Carpenter could qualify as a ‘member of the family of the deceased employee,’” the Court concluded. “Whether Carpenter actually qualifies as a ‘member of the family of the deceased employee’ under the particular facts of this case is a question that the commission will have to address.”  2022-0143.

Manoli's chef and owner, Manoli Katsaneva, shared the story on what shuttered his restaurant since December because of an accident in the business upstairs. He said a quarter-inch pipe came undone from a water cooler, letting out gallons of water for hours overnight.  ""It was just raining through the ceiling,"" he explained, ""there was water going through all of the drywall, all over the floor, the equipment, the floors, the tables. Then it went through our basement level, so it just completely kind of destroyed the entire restaurant.""  Katsanevas says damage costs have already topped $200,000 with the possibility of more to come. Without insurance, he doesn't know if his Manoli's would have recovered. And the damage couldn't have come at a worse time as the restaurant had just been nominated for a prestigious hospitality award.  ""We got nominated for James Beard [Award] which is amazing, it's like the Oscar for restaurants and obviously we were elated to have it; it would've been awesome if we were open when we had it because I'm sure it would've boosted our business,"" Katsanevas said.  Manoli's was also expecting to be the food destination during NBA All-Star Weekend. When that all came to a halt, Manoli's still found a way to make some things happen during the closure.  ""We were already contracted out by the NBA, so because of that we rented out a commissary kitchen and we still catered for three days straight, 8 hours a day over at the Hyatt for all the NBA All-Stars,"" the owner said.  On Tuesday, Manoli's was finally able to open its doors and allow customers to smell and taste what the owner himself describes as modern Greek food.  ""We're only a 50-seat restaurant. We did over 100 covers last night and they were all regulars that have been coming here for the eight years we've been open,"" Katsanevas said. ""It was just so cool to be able to see everyone again and hug everyone and say hi. It was probably one of the coolest services we ever worked."""

SPRINGFIELD GARDENS, Queens (WABC) -- A 14-year-old girl was killed after being ejected from a car as it slammed into the back of a parked UPS truck in Queens.  Police are investigating why a 16-year-old boy was behind the wheel with another minor. The NYPD says he was driving with a Learner's Permit and speeding.  ""As a mother, a mother don't want to go through this. I found her bracelet I can't sleep. I come to get her. I come to get my daughter,"" said Keisha Francis, the victim's mother.  Francis searched desperately through the broken glass Thursday morning for something, anything that would remind her of her 14-year-old daughter, Fortune Williams.  A bracelet was all that was left after the deadly crash.  ""I have three children and she showed me more love than anything else. At night I have to cuddle with Fortune, I couldn't sleep last night. I can't live without my daughter,"" Francis said.  Fortune was a passenger in the red BMW. Eyewitness News has obtained video but stopped it before it shows the car barreling into the back of a parked UPS truck.  The impact knocked the delivery driver to the ground.  ""The car was coming basically maybe 90-100 mph,"" a witness said.  An eyewitness says the 16-year-old driver of the BMW was tailing a tractor-trailer on North Conduit Avenue Wednesday around 6:45 p.m. when he tried to switch lanes and lost control.  Police, who set up a speed trap a day later, say the teen driver was going at high rate of speed.  The driver survived but Fortune was thrown from the BMW upon impact. She was a student at Springfield Gardens high school and interested in the medical field.  Her life was cut far too short, leaving her mother forever with a void.  ""My life will never be the same without Fortune. Fortune is a sweetheart. She's a loving, caring child,"" Francis said.  Her mother says she was working a double shift the night of this tragedy. Fortune was home with her older sister, but went outside to hang out in her friend's car. Sadly, she never came home.  The 16-year-old driver of the car was taken to Cohen Children's Medical Center where he is stable.

It claims the driver, Jamie Komoroski of James Island, had been “bar hopping” throughout the fateful day.  Charleston-based attorney Daniel Dalton of Mickelsen Dalton LLC is representing Aric Hutchinson, the groom who received multiple injuries in the golf cart-car accident that made national headlines.  Dalton  “This case is about keeping the public safe from drunk driving,” he said. “We’ve performed our own investigation into this matter. We’ve been cooperating with law enforcement however we can, and we felt confident enough to be ready to file the lawsuit based on what we’ve found out so far.”  The lawsuit follows a tragic accident in which the alleged drunk driver’s car collided with a golf cart transporting newlywed bride Samantha Miller and groom Hutchinson, as well as two others. The bride and groom had gotten married only hours earlier.  According to a news report, a lab report from the State Law Enforcement Division showed Komoroski had a blood-alcohol level of 0.26 at the time, more than three times over the legal limit.  Hutchinson is still physically recovering from injuries sustained in the crash, Dalton said. According to news reports, data retrieved from Komoroski’s rental car showed she was driving 65 mph, well over twice the speed limit.  Dalton said there are still facts and a lot of questions that hadn’t yet been answered.  “There are still many details we don’t know about the sequence of events leading up to the tragic crash,” Dalton said. “But by filing a lawsuit, we can begin the legal discovery process that allows us to get the answers that Samantha’s family deserves.”  According to the lawsuit, “Despite being noticeably and visibly intoxicated at each of these establishments, Jamie Komoroski continued to be served, provided, and/or allowed to consume alcohol in each of them.”  Dalton said video and photo evidence, as well as eyewitness testimony, were used in the investigation to ensure confidence in Komoroski’s level of intoxication described in the lawsuit.  Businesses named in the lawsuit were Beach Front Bars, Snapper Jacks, The Folly Beach Deli, The Drop In Bar & Deli, The Crab Shack, Folly Tacqueria, Taco Boy, El Gallo Bar and Grill, and Bottle Cap Management Group.  According to the lawsuit, these establishments “ … as licensed sellers of beer, wine and liquor for consumption pursuant to South Carolina law, had a duty to obey all laws and regulations regarding the sale of alcoholic beverages and exercise due care … not to allow patrons to become intoxicated, to not serve alcohol to intoxicated persons.”  The lawsuit also lists about 20 John and Jane Does representing owners, managers, operators, agents and more whose “negligence contributed to” Miller’s death.  The private investigation is ongoing, he said.  “We hope that the bars will cooperate with us and provide whatever they have,” Dalton said. “I would think given the tragic nature of this case that they would want to own up to whatever happened or didn’t happen … we’ve seen cooperation from some parties; others are tightening up a little bit."

Uğur Karahanlı’s father and mother died shortly before first responders arrived on the scene, while his wife was seriously injured in the accident.  According to local reports, Karahanlı, a former teacher who was dismissed by a government decree as part of purges that followed a July 15, 2016 coup attempt, was in 2021 sentenced to six-and-a-half years in prison on conviction of alleged links to the movement.  Karahanlı had previously been jailed in a prison in southern Hatay province, one of the areas hardest hit by two powerful earthquakes in early February, after which he was transferred to the prison in central Turkey.  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has been targeting followers of the Gülen movement, inspired by Turkish Muslim cleric Fethullah Gülen, since the corruption investigations of December 17-25, 2013, which implicated then-prime minister Erdoğan, his family members and his inner circle.  Dismissing the investigations as a Gülenist coup and conspiracy against his government, Erdoğan designated the movement as a terrorist organization and began to target its members. He intensified the crackdown on the movement after the abortive putsch in 2016, which he accused Gülen of masterminding. Gülen and the movement strongly deny involvement in the coup attempt or any terrorist activity.  Following the failed coup, the Turkish government declared a state of emergency and carried out a massive purge of state institutions under the pretext of an anti-coup fight.  More than 130,000 public servants, including 4,156 judges and prosecutors, as well as 24,706 members of the armed forces were summarily removed from their jobs for alleged membership in or relationships with “terrorist organizations” by emergency decree-laws subject to neither judicial nor parliamentary scrutiny.  Former public servants were not only fired from their jobs; they were also banned from working again in the public sector and getting a passport. The government also made it difficult for them to work formally in the private sector. Notes were put on the social security database about dismissed public servants to deter potential employers, leading them to work in unskilled jobs with little workplace safety. There have been a number of cases in which former public servants died in occupational accidents."

(Mainichi/Ryutaro Nishimoto)  MAEBASHI -- The parents of a 19-year-old university student who died in a recent rafting accident on the Tone River in Gunma Prefecture are seeking answers after he was found without a life jacket, and it emerged a guide on another boat had said the student's raft would capsize.  The victim, Keisuke Honda, had only just entered a national university in Tokyo, and on the day of the accident, he left his family home early in the morning. ""I had no idea that he was going rafting,"" his mother said. His father added, ""I thought he was going on a day trip with friends and that he would come back as normal.""  At around 6:45 p.m. on May 5, the parents received a call from Gunma Prefecture Police's Numata Police Station, informing them of the accident. They went by car to Gunma, arriving at about 9 p.m. It was dark and they couldn't see any rescue boats out.  ""Is no one looking for our son?"" they wondered in shock. The parents took out a flashlight they had bought on the way and made their way through the grass at the side of the river.  ""I thought that if he was in water as cold as this, I wanted to rescue him quickly,"" the father said. Multiple cuts ran up his arms, apparently made by the grass.  Son found with no life jacket  The teen's parents spent seven hours searching a roughly 1 kilometer stretch of the river starting from the accident site, but didn't find anything. Police resumed their search at 5 a.m. on May 6, and at 5:49 a.m. they found him about 300 meters downstream from the Suwakyo Bridge over the Tone River. The cause of death was drowning. He was not wearing a life jacket.  The parents met with officials from the rafting tour company at Numata Police Station on May 6, and spoke with them for about an hour. They asked about the situation at the time their son's raft capsized and about rescue efforts immediately afterward, but said they didn't receive a concrete explanation. ""They didn't tell us anything,"" the student's father recalled angrily.  Their distrust grew after they heard about conditions at the time of the accident from a man in another rafting boat, who took part in the same tour.  According to the man, the participants were in three boats, with two full of families with children, and a blue one carrying Honda and his friends. The man said that when he got into his boat, the guide said, ""That blue boat is going to capsize."" The other boats passed the accident site safely and then waited for the blue boat, and again the guide said that Honda's boat would capsize.  After the accident, the other two rafts were taken to the side of the river and the tour ended partway through. Participants were reportedly handed commemorative photos at this point, taken by a photographer who was following the boats in a vehicle along the river. The man said he wanted Honda's parents to know the river conditions at the time, and handed his photos to them, and also told them about what he saw.  Rocks and driftwood are seen scattered about at the scene of the accident as water splashes up, on the Tone River in Minakami, Gunma Prefecture, on May 9, 2023. (Mainichi/Ryutaro Nishimoto)  The photos showed Honda wearing a life jacket and a helmet, shoulder to shoulder with his friends, and showed him laughing as water splashed above the raft.  His mother said, ""It was a dangerous activity. He was suddenly thrown out into water chilly with snowmelt, and his life jacket was carried downstream, so he must have sunk into the water around where the boat capsized. The tour guide's rescue effort wasn't enough at all. I want the police to conduct a proper investigation.""  Operating company: 'A turn of events we can't take back'  The president of the company that organized the tour commented, ""I'm truly sorry that there has been a turn of events we can't take back. We will consider efforts to prevent a recurrence and think about how to atone for this.""  According to the president, participants sign consent forms acknowledging that if they fall out of the boat and stand up the current, their legs could get pinned against rocks and they could suffer broken bones or even drown. Verbal explanations were also given to make people aware of the risks.  On the possibility of a boat capsizing, the company president said, there were times when people played balancing games, standing on the edge of the boat and that the boats would sometimes capsize as a result. But people don't do that in the current season when there is a lot of water in the river and the temperature is cold.  Regarding the comment from the passenger on the other boat that their guide had said that the blue boat would capsize, the president said, ""When two boats have gone ahead and are waiting, we sometimes humorously explain that we will help the other one in such and such a way if they capsize.""  According to Outdoor Joint Association Minakami, an organization of Gunma Prefecture-based rafting companies, safety checks are conducted along the Tone River five times a year, and if tour guides find anything abnormal, they are required to quickly report it to the association. Each operator is also certified in whitewater rescue and first aid. Association director Mitsuyoshi Ishikawa commented, ""If something happens, we respond quickly. We've established fairly strict safety standards.""  A total of four people died in Tone River rafting accidents in Gunma Prefecture between 2000 and 2002 -- two male and one female passenger in their 20s and 30s and one male guide in his 20s.  Water safety group chairman: 'Wear your life jacket properly'  Hidetoshi Saito, chairman of the Society of Water Rescue and Survival Research and a graduate school professor at the Nagaoka University of Technology in Niigata Prefecture, commented, ""People need to be aware that boats can sink or capsize. That's not to say that we shouldn't get into them; rather I want people to wear life jackets properly so they can enjoy the ride.""  In the event of an accident such as a boat capsizing, it is important to float on the water to ensure one can breathe. According to Saito, life jackets can come off easily if only the zipper is closed, so the belt and buckle need to be fastened tighter than people might expect. He says that if the belt and buckle hadn't come undone, then the student may have slipped out of the life jacket, but if there were undone, then there is a possibility he either wasn't wearing it properly or had undone it himself before drowning. ""If he wasn't wearing it properly from the start then the operator would be held responsible,"" he said.  (Japanese original by Azusa Hinata and Ryutaro Nishimoto, Maebashi Bureau)"

Credit: JavierLJ/Shutterstock.com.  Chinese mining company Zijin Mining has reported a mining accident at one of its mines in Tibet, the circumstances of which have led to the stopping of production.  On 14 May, a lift cage fell during shaft construction in the drainage system at the Julong open-pit copper and polymetallic mine, cutting contact with six workers.  Zijin has suspended mining production at the site and launched search and rescue operations for the missing workers.  The company added that it has carried out an investigation and rectification of the hidden risks. The cause of the accident is still being investigated.  The construction of the Julong mine was subcontracted to Fujian Xingwanxiang Construction Group by Zijin subsidiary Tibet Julong Copper.  Zijin owns a 50.1% stake in the Julong mine, which produced 115,000 tonnes (t) of copper last year and is planning to increase its production to 152,000t this year.  Phase one production at Julong Copper began in December 2021. Located in the Tibetan plateau at an altitude between 4,000m and 5,000m, the mine features 10.7 million tonnes of copper and 570,000t of molybdenum.  Last month, the company through Barrick Gold, a joint venture with Barrick Niugini (BNL), entered a New Porgera Progress Agreement (NPPA) with the Papua New Guinea Government.  According to the NPPA, all three parties – Zijin, BNL and the Papua New Guinea Government – have agreed to reopen the Porgera Gold Mine at the earliest opportunity.  Operations at the mine were suspended in April 2020 due to the failure to secure approval for its extension. The NPPA signing is an important milestone in resuming operations."

After making sure everyone is safe and getting medical attention if necessary, many individuals find themselves wondering what else needs to be done or what rights they may have under the law.  To help sort out this legal process of a car accident case and know what information will be relevant during such proceedings, here are some key points to keep in mind for both women and men.  How to File a Claim After an Accident  Filing a claim after an accident can be a complicated and time-consuming process, but it is essential to ensure that you receive the compensation you deserve. Whether you were involved in a car accident, slip and fall, or any other type of incident, it’s crucial to seek legal advice right away to understand your rights and responsibilities.  You will need to gather evidence, such as photographs, witness statements, and medical records, to support your claim. It’s important to remember that insurance companies may try to offer you a settlement that is not in your best interest, so having an experienced attorney in your corner can help you navigate the claim process and negotiate a fair settlement. Don’t hesitate to reach out to a legal professional for assistance in filing your claim and protecting your rights.  Getting legal advice  The legal process for a car accident case can be complex, so it is always in your best interest to get legal advice as soon as possible. An experienced attorney will help you understand the laws that apply to your situation and provide sound legal advice on how to proceed with your claim. Whether you decide to get advice from youraccidentattorneys.com, or research to find a suitable attorney, make sure you are getting assistance from a qualified professional. When you are represented by a qualified attorney, you will be able to rest assured that your claim is in capable hands and that your rights are being appropriately protected.  Types of Damages You Can Seek in a Car Accident Case  In car accident cases, the types of damages that can be sought can vary greatly depending on the circumstances of the incident. The most common types of damages that plaintiffs may seek include compensation for medical expenses, lost wages, property damage, and pain and suffering.  However, there are other damages that may also be applicable, such as punitive damages, which are intended to punish a defendant for particularly egregious behavior. It is important to work with an experienced attorney who can guide you through the legal process and help you pursue the appropriate damages for your case. Don’t hesitate to seek legal advice if you’ve been involved in a car accident and believe you deserve compensation for any losses or injuries suffered.  Proving Fault in a Car Accident Case  When it comes to car accident cases, proving fault can be a complex process that often ends up in court. Legal professionals and insurance companies will examine a variety of factors, including police reports, witness statements, and medical evidence to determine who is at fault for the accident. It is important to remember that proving fault is not simply about assigning blame, but rather about providing justice and ensuring that the responsible party is held accountable for their actions. Therefore, if you are involved in a car accident, it is crucial to seek legal representation to ensure that your rights are upheld and the responsible party is brought to justice.  Common Defense Strategies Used in Car Accident Cases  When it comes to car accident cases, common defense strategies are often employed in an effort to minimize or eliminate liability. One such strategy involves arguing that the plaintiff was partially or completely at fault for the accident. Another common defense tactic is to challenge the plaintiff’s claims of injury or damages, often by questioning the severity of the injuries or the validity of the medical treatment received. Moreover, defendants may attempt to settle the case for a smaller amount by arguing that the plaintiff had pre-existing injuries or conditions that were aggravated by the accident. It is important to work with an experienced attorney who can help navigate these defense strategies and fight for your rights in court.  Timeline of the Legal Process for a Car Accident Case  When you’ve been in a car accident, the legal process can seem daunting and complicated. However, it’s important to understand the timeline of events that will unfold. The process typically begins with filing a claim with your insurance company, followed by an investigation into the accident and determining who is at fault.  From there, negotiations may take place to reach a settlement. If a settlement cannot be reached, the case will proceed to court where a judge or jury will ultimately determine the outcome. It’s important to have a knowledgeable and experienced legal team on your side to guide you through each step of the process and ensure that your rights are protected.  The legal process of a car accident case can be a painstaking one requiring effort from all parties involved in order to satisfactorily resolve the dispute. It is vital for those who are involved in an accident to understand their rights and the steps they can take toward seeking the damages they deserve. Knowing who is at fault for an accident, what types of damages you can recover, and having a timeline for the progression of your case will help ensure that proceedings move quickly and efficiently. With this knowledge in hand, each party can work together to ensure a swift resolution in their car accident case."

Warren,29, was walking along the junction of Trinity Church Road and North Shore Road between 2 am and 3:15 am when he was struck by a car.  His death took Bermuda’s road fatality toll for 2023 to five.  In a social media post, the Bermuda Football Association (BFA) said it “joins the Warren and Bermuda football family in mourning the loss of a rising icon of the beautiful game, Marco Warren, who had his debut international cap for Bermuda in March 2015 against Nicaragua. The match resulted in a 2-0 victory for our Gombey Warriors.  “BFA extends its heartfelt condolences to Marco’s family, friends, teammates, and fans. Our logo will be displayed in black until Marco’s funeral”.  Warren’s club, the PHC Zebras, also paid tribute to him saying they will never forget the impact that their star player had on the team and Bermuda.  “Marco was more than just a player. He was a part of our family, embodied the Zebra spirit, and was the heart of our team. Marco continually left fans in awe of his skills and inspired other players to improve. He was a humble person despite his level of greatness. When he was on the field, the “magician” just went to work,” the club said.  “Marco was a loving father, son, brother, boyfriend, nephew, cousin, teammate, and true friend. He was a leader both on and off the field as he demonstrated the well-rounded individual we aspire to develop for our community. All who encountered him were impressed with his wisdom and kindness.”  Bermudian star and Bristol City player Nahki Wells also remembered his teammate on Instagram.  Photo: @nahkiwells on Instagram  Wells posted a photo of him and Warren celebrating during a match.  Anyone with information that could solve this incident is urged to contact Police Constable Deforest Evans at 717-0860 or by e-mail at devans@bps.bm.

Nearly five of those collisions turn out fatal. These kinds of accidents can lead to life-changing disabilities and catastrophic financial losses. You might lose work hours, incur thousands of medical bills, and experience severe trauma. If you or a loved one has been injured in an accident, consult Edmonton pedestrian accident lawyers who can help you overcome all three challenges. However, you can take a few steps at the accident spot to solidify your legal claim.  1) Call for Medical Assistance  Your health is the most important consideration after a collision. Severe injuries don’t always make themselves known straight away. Shock can mask pain, so getting an assessment from a qualified healthcare provider is crucial. That said, this is when the evidence is at its best, so contact local law enforcement as soon as you’ve called for medical assistance. If your injuries are too severe to gather photographs and numbers, police presence at the scene will bolster your case.  An emergency room assessment is one of the most powerful things you can do to prove your damages. The sooner you see a doctor, the more convincing your evidence will be. Remember that personal injury cases draw more compensation when there’s solid diagnostic evidence, so X-rays and the like are key.  2) Gather Contact Information  Eyewitnesses disperse quickly. If your injuries aren’t life-threatening, exchanging information with everyone involved in the collision is essential. If there are eyewitnesses in sight, gather their contact details as well. You should also collect the insurance details of the at-fault party. While the police will gather their evidence, you should also take your photographs. If you see skid marks, car dents, or any other forms of damage, assume that an expert could use them to prove the cause of the accident. Make sure you snap the scene from different angles. You can’t take too many photographs, but you can certainly take too few.  3) Don’t Admit Guilt  Admitting guilt to eyewitnesses and at-fault parties can weaken your case, so avoid any comments that could be interpreted this way. Don’t apologize or express a sense of guilt. It’s also best to keep the experience off of social media. Tweets and blog posts can be used against you in court. It’s best to limit your communication to the absolute minimum lest you accidentally harm your chances in a personal injury trial.  4) Make Sure the Police Take Your Statement  Almost 40% of police reports don’t include a statement from the pedestrian, particularly if they’re sent to urgent care. The police must record your version of events. Your voice matters, so don’t be afraid to question the police report. This paperwork can be amended to reflect the situation more accurately. Call a lawyer if the officer refuses to take your statement or fix inaccuracies.  5) Start Making an Insurance Claim  Once you’ve dealt with the urgent aspects of your collision, it’s time to phone the driver’s insurance company to launch a claim. It’s best to limit your narrative to the essential facts, no matter how much they pressure you into providing more details. You’re not required to disclose facts about your medical care, police report, or partial fault.  6) Keep Track of Follow-Up Care  The more detailed your medical care is, the stronger your case will be, so go to all your recommended follow-up appointments. Request diagnostics if necessary. Keep an ongoing record of your medical bills and transportation costs. If you miss time off work, add your lost income to your records. These details will ultimately go to an insurer, but it’s best to seek legal advice before you hand them over.  Personal injury settlements can be difficult to secure without legal help. Insurers and at-fault parties are notorious for low-balling victims, but you can build a successful case with the right assistance. You need someone in your corner, no matter how strong or resourceful you are."

State police said the bear was crossing the southbound lanes of I-85 about two miles north of the DeWitt exit when the driver of a sports-utility vehicle slammed on the brakes to avoid hitting it. Another SUV, however, was not so fortunate and wound up hitting both the bear and the back of the first SUV.  No one inside either vehicle was injured. Witnesses told state police the bear ran away from the scene.  Earlier Monday, Petersburg Police reported a bear sighting near the Henry William Townhouses at the intersection of Lee Avenue and South Street. Authorities were encouraging anyone who may see the bear not to approach it and instead call police at (804) 732-4222 or the Virginia Department of Games and Inland Fisheries at (804) 367-1000.  A Petersburg Police spokesperson told The Progress-Index no other sightings were reported in the city.  Black bears are a common sight anywhere in Virginia, according to the state Department of Wildlife Resources. While seen sporadically along the coast, a DWF map indicates these animals can be found most anywhere in the state because they adapt so easily to their surroundings.  “They prefer habitats that provide cover, such as a densely wooded mature oak forests or swampy area in the coastal plain, and easily accessible food resources,” the DWF website said.  The National Park Service says black bears are far less aggressive than brown or any other type of bear and will usually avoid human contact. However, authorities remind people that despite their temperment, black bears still are wild animals and could attack if provoked. Therefore, it is wise to let a black bear alone should you see one.

Smith stated the map was originally conceived with split-screen in mind, and the team at Infinity Ward used Shipment for internal tests. It was then included in the broader ""playlist script"" for Modern Warfare, but the developer ""forgot"" to remove it before the game's final release.  After that, there was ""no going back,"" Smith recalled.  It is hard to imagine Call of Duty without Shipment. Even those with only a vague familiarity with the series can often name it as one of the franchise's maps. While it may have been included by accident, at least the end result was a happy one.  After all, we are now 16 years on from its first iteration, and here I am still writing about it."

The show, which first premiered in 2020, sees its cast battling a few unexpected surprises in Season 4. In the May 9 episode, the group was stunned when Judd Ryder and Marlene Harris’ son, Wyatt, is injured in a terrible bicycle accident – leaving some fans to wonder if he will die in the season finale. Before taking a peek into Wyatt’s seemingly tragic fate, let’s look back to his time on the popular show.

The teenager, who was raised by his mother, discovers that Judd is his father through an online genetics database. However, Judd and Wyatt’s relationship gets off to a rocky start, due to their conflicting lifestyles. But after being seemingly disappointed by his son’s veganism and disinterest in hunting, Judd eventually comes around and the two form a strong bond.

Share Copy Link Copy  Hide Transcript Show Transcript  Leo played it perfect tone which was, he's shivering. He could barely form the words, he knows he's gonna die. We've already seen that. He's made *** sacrifice for her. Of course, very controversial. You know, that he could have gotten on the, on the, the, the raft with her, but he saw that it would have compromised her safety and he kind of steps back. He did what the gentleman on the ship did. I was happy when I wrote that scene, I'll be back, I'll be back. So that, that's *** funny thing because in the script, it, it actually read, I think I'll come back and there was something about the way Arnold said it with his then quite thick Austrian accent. That didn't sound quite right. And so I said, well, just switch it to, I'll be back, you know, and he said, really? I said, yeah, and we just kind of, you know, made it up, made it up in the moment and of course, it became quite iconic. But here's the interesting thing about that line. You're watching the movie for the first time, you have no idea what's gonna happen next. And yet it still got *** laugh somehow people had gotten already. This guy was this bulldozer. You just get this innate sense of this guy as just this juggernaut. And when he says I'll be back, it's gonna be bad. So people laughed before they even knew they didn't even know what *** Terminator movie was at that point. Well, I think they were starting to figure it out. Come with me if you want to live. Terminator Two. That's the pivotal moment where Sarah has this stunning realization that the Terminator that's before her, her worst nightmare has turned into her savior and the savior of her son. And it was just *** fun moment to see how Linda would play that. We knew it was *** tough moment for her because her whole reality literally flips upside down. She played it beautifully. It's just *** nice piece of acting chicken. Oh, it's *** pure moment of exultation for him. He's just alive. He's in the moment he doesn't have *** penny in his pocket. He won the damn ticket in *** poker game. He's just living carefree fancy free. He's met Fabrizio and they're just having fun. It was an expression of life, his life spirit, which seems so unquenchable and so full of potential. Every time I'm aching by, I'm getting ready to do *** run. I'm, I'm talking to Leo on the radio. Ok. Howl, like *** wolf. You know, I got him howling like *** wolf. We tried it, you know, I don't know, 10 times and he looked great and his, his acting spirit was there, but we just couldn't quite find the right word and it just popped into my head. I said, just say, I'm the king of the world. I hear back on the lucky what I said, you gotta sell it, you gotta sell it. You know, just say I'm the king of the world and he did and he put his arms out and you feel that spirit and it became the focal point of the whole scene, the whole ship's energy, the pounding of the engines, the dolphins jumping and everything, all, you know, the sort of the beauty and the power and the majesty of it all culminated to his, his spirit at the, at the bow. Now I come along at the Academy Awards and make the classic mistake of assuming that just because we had won best picture or that, that I got be best director that everybody in the room loved the movie and would celebrate *** reference to the movie, but they weren't, not everybody voted for it, right? And the knives are always, they're, they're kind of always half drawn even when they're there to celebrate you. The knife is half out of the, out of the, the hilt. I mean out of the, the sheath, right? Yeah. So I put my foot in that one, Jack. I want you to draw me like one of your French girls, *** lot of people have, have kind of mocked and spoofed that line. But I think *** lot of people really like it. She's bold. She's taking the power. She's been robbed of power by her fiance, by her mother, by her social straitjacket. He's this devil may care, free spirit, artistic spirit, all the things that she wants to be and she just flips the script and tells him to do his thing. I think people celebrate her empowerment as *** character in, in that moment, it's also the promise of romance, the promise of sex. It's also this great liberation and it's my 40 something year old hand as Leo's 20 year old hand. But I do the, the picture and then Leo just made some head scratching, you know, while he was fiercely concentrating on, on her and pretending to draw. The only problem is I draw left handed and he was madly drawn way right handed. I should have made *** draw left handed. When you sketch, there's an arc that's formed by your wrist. So all my lines are arching in this direction. Now, I've got to do the drawing backwards. So if you look in the movie, I'm doing the outlining, but I'm not doing any of the shading. I'm doing the smudging cause I couldn't do it because the arcs were all the wrong, wrong direction. I don't know about you, but I intend to write *** strongly worded letter to the White Star line about all this. I just think people appreciate Jack's presence of mind to be taking the stress out of the situation for her by making *** joke. And Leo played it perfect tone which was, he's shivering. He can barely form the words. He knows he's gonna die. We've already seen that he's made *** sacrifice for her, of course, very controversial. You know, that he could have gotten on the, on the, the, the raft with her, but he saw that it would have compromised her safety and he kind of steps back. He did what the gentleman on the ship did when they stepped back from the life boats to save the women and Children first because that was honor and duty. I was happy when I wrote that scene. Get away from her. You ***. That's *** great uh iconic moment. The moment we knew we had them was then they just burst into wild applause on that line. They loved it. So we knew the movie had had landed. And then you realize this movie is about two females of different species, protecting their young and it's on, it was just the right line at the right time in that movie. And then the audience response to it reminded me why you do this. I was *** marine. Hey, yeah, *** warrior of the jarhead clan. My brother Dave uh was *** marine. He died recently and you go your whole life as *** marine. Jake doesn't matter where he goes in the universe if he was *** US marine at some point, he's *** marine. Only *** marine can call himself *** jarhead unless they're *** marine. In which case it's ok. So that was just *** little inside kind of marine corps reference. I put ***, I put *** few of them in, you know, kind of for my brother Dave who's *** guy that I really loved and admired. I see here, I see you, I see you as *** very important line. It resonates for people *** lot just popped into my head while I was writing the treatment in 95. And it's like, what would *** navy greeting be? You're walking towards somebody and I see you, you know, I basically kind of the simplicity of it, right? And then it started to take on various layers of meaning as I thought, well, what do people really want? They want to be seen? They want to be acknowledged, they want to be recognized, they want to be respected, they wanna be loved seeing it. It took on *** deeper meaning. Jake's kind of struggling with the idea. But of course, the whole movie is about that. The movie starts with him opening his eyes and it ends with him opening, he has woken up to *** greater experience of the world to *** deeper understanding. He's the only human that's ever truly understood the navi from their perspective and he inhabits as his avatar, he inhabits their world. And of course, he's learning from this woman that he's falling in love with. I think you're never more open than when you're falling in love with somebody that can teach you something. And so I see you took on many meanings. You know, I understand you, I acknowledge you, I respect you, I love you. There's the top layer of the movie which is plot and character. And then there's the second layer of the movie, which is thematic, right? Which is about themes of indigenous culture and human civilization, kind of at war with itself, you know, pulling us away from our connection to nature and all those, all those things. But there's another layer, there's *** tertiary layer which is mystical. If we don't service that layer as well, then we're not really doing *** worthy sequel or worthy Sequels to the first film. It continues to be important to ask the audience to see kind of with better eyes, some of the things that are, you know, our problems and our world. I mean, Avatar doesn't pretend to have some great solution. It's just saying, you know, our our our human journey is is very troubled right now. This is our whole, this is our family, this is our fortress. I question it. As I go along spending five years on essentially one ip one, you know, it's, it's 2.5 movies that we've been working on over the last last five years. You know, I question it and then I start seeing the results and then it's *** no brainer at that point. Then it just all comes to life and that world comes to life and you see the characters come to life. It's kind of magical. You know, sometimes I have to pinch myself when I see the end result of the process. So you just have to have faith in the process as you, as you go along. I knew I wanted to tell *** family story. I wanted to as an artist express some of the, the things, the ideas, the feelings that I had as *** parent and that I had observed in my kids and I'd done sort of parent child stories in the past, even all the way back to, to aliens and uh Terminator Two, but I hadn't lived it. There was *** lot of uh sort of great dramatic grist for the mill there uh around the dysfunction of families. But how there's *** strength at the core of families that helps get people through times are all in this highly angst ridden, highly anxious time. Right now. I wanted to within *** fantasy world show, special to *** young audience. It's ok even in even, you know, 200 years from now on *** distant planet, you know, kids are still gonna feel anxious or, or, or depressed or, or unseen, it's ok. You know, I'm just not only channeling my experience as *** parent, but my experience as *** teenager myself. And I just thought that that foundation of universal human experience put into the most far flung fantasy environment that you can imagine grounds it emotionally.

Instead, they made a simple assumption: that any violence against a left-wing protester is justified on its face. Perry had lived out the right-wing fantasy of lethal violence in defense of “order.” By their lights, he had done nothing wrong.  Prominent conservatives have taken the same view of Daniel Penny, the 24-year-old assailant in the killing of Jordan Neely in a New York City subway car this month. What we know is that Neely, who was homeless, was erratic and acting hostile toward other passengers. Witnesses said he had not attacked anyone. At some point, Penny, a former Marine, placed Neely in a chokehold, which killed him. Two other passengers restrained Neely while he struggled on the ground. Penny is now charged with second-degree manslaughter.  We don’t know much, yet, about Penny’s mind-set or motivation during his confrontation on the subway. But this has not stopped conservatives from valorizing him in the same way they valorized Rittenhouse and Perry. “The Marine who stepped in to protect others is a hero,” said Greene, now a congresswoman. The decision to charge Penny, said the Fox News host Greg Gutfeld, was “pro-criminal” and “anti-hero.”  In a testament to conservative enthusiasm for Penny, an online fund-raiser has raised more than $2 million for his legal defense. And DeSantis, now angling for the Republican presidential nomination, stepped in with a message of support. “We must defeat the Soros-Funded DAs, stop the Left’s pro-criminal agenda, and take back the streets for law abiding citizens,” he said on Twitter. “We stand with Good Samaritans like Daniel Penny. Let’s show this Marine … America’s got his back.”  It’s the same language, the same tropes, the same ideas. In listening to conservative fans of Rittenhouse, Perry and Penny, you would never know that there were actual people on the other side of these confrontations. You would never know that those people were, in life, entitled to the protection of the law and that they are, in death, entitled to a full account of the last moments of their lives, with legal responsibility for the men who killed them, if that’s what a jury decides."

Where some might see monotony, Shattuck saw opportunity. There was something about the feel of that first plastic set of clubs in his hands. Something about the challenge of firing to an imaginary pin. Something about the game that gripped him early and never let go.  ""He was obsessed with (golf),"" Scott Shattuck said of his son. ""We had to almost drag him inside the house.""  So yes, Shattuck always believed there was a chance he'd make it to the sport's biggest stage. Yet the 4-year-old who took delight in tearing up his parents' yard deep into the twilight couldn't have imagined the circuitous route that brought the now-28-year-old to the 2023 PGA Championship.  The 12-footer for par that Shattuck drained to win the PGA Professional Championship in New Mexico last month assured him of a spot in the strongest field of the year starting Thursday at Oak Hill.  It also served as a testament to the relentlessness of a self-professed grinder who was forced to rebuild his swing from the ground up following a car accident in 2019 that resulted in multiple herniated disks in his lower back and made even walking difficult.  The player who would spend 12 hours a day during the summer as a kid pounding ball after ball on the practice range spent the better part of two years watching the guys he competed with on the mini-tour circuit climb the ladder while he went through countless hours of physical therapy and wondered if he'd ever be able to swing something close to pain-free again.  ""Physically you can't even play golf, and mentally it's tough because now what else do you do with your time,"" Shattuck said. ""It took a lot to get over that hurdle.""  So Shattuck poured himself into his work as an assistant golf pro, showing others how to fix their swings while trying to devise a way to tweak his own.  ""It was more of an experiment than anything,"" he said. ""I knew what exactly in my golf swing hurt, so I figured if I could do something with my setup and my golf swing to take some pressure off of those areas, that even if I didn't fully heal that maybe I could still swing a golf club with minimal pain.""  After a two-year sabbatical, his game slowly returned, though not quite the same as before. A more upright stance cost him some distance with his irons, though he has compensated by finding a few more yards with his driver. And the days of planting himself at the range for hours on end are long gone.  The pain is manageable, at least most of the time. He abandoned Korn Ferry Tour qualifying after the first round last fall when his back flared up out of nowhere. His preparation includes a series of stretching exercises and twice-weekly visits to a physical therapist, all of it tinged with just a hint of uncertainty when he wakes up in the morning.  Shattuck is confident his back and his game are in good enough shape to make the cut this weekend. Asking for anything beyond that, at least for now, is just being greedy.  While the vast majority of the 156-man field plays golf for a living, Shattuck remains primarily a teacher. The morning after he got back from his victory in New Mexico — a win that earned Shattuck $60,000, a berth into the PGA and an exemption into six events in the 2024 season — he was back at Rolling Green Golf Club in Springfield, about 15 miles west of downtown Philadelphia.  There were slices to fix. Hooks to solve. A love for the game to impart the way his father did to him as a kid. The younger Shattuck was 14 when he beat his father for the first time, shooting a 67 from the back tees at The Golf Course at Glen Mills while the adults in the group turned to his father with eyebrows raised.  ""Braden would go around (with us) and (they'd) be like, 'Damn, this kid can play,'"" Scott Shattuck said with a laugh.  Sure, his son would prefer to play with a back that doesn't require so much maintenance. Yet the unwanted sabbatical brought on by the car accident also shifted Shattuck's perspective.  ""I had a little bit more of an intense outlook when I was younger,"" he said. ""Now I just feel a lot more fortunate to be out here. I feel like I'm playing with house money so it feels more relaxed.""  At least until he stands on the tee at 7 a.m. on Thursday as part of the first group out on the East Course, a moment that seemed so far away when he was tearing up the backyard as a kid — and even farther during his long recovery following the accident — finally at hand.  Maybe the nerves he fended off during the arduous process of getting here will make a brief appearance. He's not sure.  ""That's a great question,"" he said with a laugh. ""I think we're all going to find out the answer to that one at the same time."""

The incident occurred at around 2 a.m. on Sunday, May 14th on US 287 in Wichita Falls, Texas.  According to News Channel 6, a semi truck crashed through a grassy median along US 287 and and overturned, blocking the northbound lanes and much of the southbound lanes. The overturned semi truck then caused another wreck involving two box trucks, but no one was seriously hurt in either accident.  “You’ve got a semi truck that’s overturned blocking the entire north bound lane and into the southbound lanes as well. You got another accident that’s occurred already, I think maybe both had actually occurred and because people on the south bound lane tried to stop,” said Sheriff Duke, who responded to the wreck.  After the initial wrecks, Good Samaritans on the southbound side decided to pull over and try to help, and that’s when they were fatally struck by another vehicle. Duke says that, while stopping to help is appreciated, the safety of the situation should be assessed before stopping.  “Your life has got to be there Safety first before you can save someone else’s life, and so obviously call in locations, vehicles, what they see, if they saw multiple victims, anything,” said Sheriff Duke. “If they can park in that area where they’re safe, where no traffic is going to run over them, then they can get out and help and leave their emergency hazard lights on.”  “They’re not immune to being hit by people driving with their cellphones in their face and they’re just not paying attention, it just happens,” said Sheriff Duke. “But they need to put their emergency hazards on and either get past the accident and get in a safe area they can stop in and come back up on the shoulder of the road just to avoid traffic.”  The incident is still under investigation."

(Photo by Megan Vande Voort)  Seaplane accidents, while few, represent an area of general aviation where targeted training could pay real dividends.  That’s the takeaway from a new seaplane accident analysis report by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association Air Safety Institute (ASI).  Funded in part by the Seaplane Pilots Association, the Seaplane Accident Analysis Report 2008 – 2022 offers a detailed accident analysis, addressing flight conditions, fleet composition, accident causes, NTSB findings, and more.  The report also includes recommendations to reduce the number of accidents, including several training tips.  “Seaplanes are highly capable and uniquely suited for a wide variety of operations, but seaplane flying carries additional risk — due to the environment in which they operate — when not flown safely by proficient seaplane pilots,” says Robert Geske, AOPA Air Safety Institute manager of aviation safety analysis.  During the report period, 2008 to 2022, there were 406 seaplane accidents, with 77 ending in fatalities, he reports.  “For reference, general aviation accidents during the same period averaged 1,200 to 1,500 with 200 ending in a fatality,” he says. “The seaplane fleet makes up less than 5% of all general aviation aircraft, so understanding these types of accidents is valuable to the seaplane community.”  This report is also important as getting data has been increasingly difficult since the FAA began “repressing” seaplane activity data in 2015 “due to unreliable reporting and analysis.”  “For example, few seaplane aircraft operators report their hours. In addition, aircraft that switch out floats for other landing gear — as the season dictates — make reporting more difficult,” it continues.  The limited availability of seaplane flight hours and activity prevents a rate-based analysis of seaplane accidents. It also prevents “a meaningful year-to-year comparison and understanding of whether the rise and fall of accidents is attributed to flight activity or to an actual change,” the report notes.  With all that said, the report finds that one factor dominates the cause of seaplane accidents: Abnormal runway contact (ARC).  “This is best thought of as a landing surface contact since seaplanes do not need to operate from a paved runway surface,” according to the report. “These types of accidents occur mainly during landing (90%), with many resulting from gear-down water landings.”  The report recommends that a “broader adoption and installation of gear warning systems that aid in identifying the landing surface should reduce accidents in this category.”  It also suggests more participation by pilots in the Seaplane Pilots Association’s “Positive rate, gear up” campaign.  Loss of control in flight (LOC-I) is the deadliest cause of seaplane accidents.  “Given seaplanes’ unique operating environment, the maneuvering phase is where most of these accidents occur,” the report notes.  “Dedicated efforts targeted at low-speed awareness, distraction prevention, and positive aircraft control could drive down the frequency of fatal accidents,” it continues. “Seaplane pilots may also benefit from the installation and use of angle of attack indicators.”  It also notes that the installation of gear warning and advisory systems, which work to identify the landing surface and inform pilots of proper surface or water gear configuration, may drastically reduce nose-over events.  “While not as deadly as LOC-I, reducing the volume of accidents would, most likely, positively impact the cost and availability of insurance,” the report states.  The report concludes with a number of recommendations, including additional training, specifically in aircraft control, loss of control prevention, gear configuration, and operations during maneuvering.  One of the big issues with seaplane training are gaps in flying and training, according to the report, which notes that many pilots swap floats for skis or wheels as the seasons change.  “Seaplane pilots may experience six or more months away from seaplane operations, a situation that hinders their proficiency and impacts their training. Pilots who experience gaps due to seasonality need to take added precautions when resuming seaplane operations. Combating these gaps through a training course could help mitigate proficiency-related accidents.”  Another critical area for increased training is in decisionmaking, which was cited by the NTSB as a key contributor to seaplane accidents.  “Safety starts and ends with good decisions,” the report noted. “Reminding pilots of the effect their choices have on the outcome of the flight and helping them understand how to mitigate risks will further reduce all GA accidents.”  You can read the full report at AOPA.org/Training-and-Safety/Air-Safety-Institute/Accident-Analysis/Seaplane-Accident-Report."

Strickland was 50 on June 28, 2019, when she shot McWaters at the home they rented at 773 Target Road, just outside of Holly Hill.  There’s no debate as to whether Strickland shot and killed McWaters, but there is as to whether it was an accident or murder.  Strickland’s murder trial got underway Tuesday with 1st Circuit Assistant Solicitor David Osborne telling the jury that the killing was intentional, not any type of accident.  Osborne told the jury that McWaters was a long-time alcoholic.  “He was drinking himself to an early grave, but it should’ve been God’s call when Robert’s time on Earth was over,” he said.  Osborne claims Strickland couldn’t have accidentally shot McWaters because of the multiple safety features that were on gun used in the killing.  He also said Strickland initially told law enforcement officers that McWaters came at her, so she fired the gun at him.  The bullet struck him in his right temple.  Strickland later told investigators that McWaters challenged her knowledge of firearms.  She told investigators that she retrieved her son’s pistol from a dresser drawer in the extra bedroom.  Video of Strickland’s interview with investigators was played for the jury.  In it, she told Orangeburg County Sheriff’s Office Lt. James Shumpert that she was holding the gun and McWaters said, “You don’t know how to do it” as he sat on a chair at the kitchen table.  “I’m holding the gun. I didn’t know how to take it (the safeties) off, but I got it off,” she said.  She claims the gun accidentally discharged.  She put the gun back in its holster, according to authorities, before she called 911.  Defense attorney Jack Swerling told the jury that even though McWaters and Strickland’s relationship “was volatile and contentious, there was mutual feeling between each other. That’s why they stayed together.”  “She had no intention of leaving” the relationship, Swerling said.  The jury heard testimony that there had been a couple of calls for law enforcement to respond to the home previously concerning domestic disputes.  In one call, Strickland told responding Deputy Donald Huffman that McWaters kept waking her up while she tried to sleep.  Video footage from Huffman’s body camera was played for the jury.  Huffman told Strickland to consider going to a magistrate’s office to try to get the eviction process started to have McWaters leave.  Strickland never sought McWaters’ eviction.  Some of the witnesses the state called on Tuesday include:  Officer Michael Mann, who was employed by the Holly Hill Police Department at the time of the killing.  He was the first officer to respond to the residence at the request of the Orangeburg County Sheriff’s Office.  The jury watched Mann’s body camera video recording at the scene.  They saw Strickland was overcome with emotion and crying when Mann arrived at the house.  She was outside while using her phone and pointed to the inside of the home.  Orangeburg County Sheriff’s Office Deputy Roman Rodriguez, the first deputy to arrive on the scene.  Officer Joseph Henry Daugherty, Strickland’s ex-husband. Daugherty formerly worked at the Holly Hill Police Department, but wasn’t an officer there when McWaters was killed.  Daugherty testified that Strickland called him and told him that she’d “hurt” McWaters.  He told Strickland to call 911. He claims that she told him she did call 911, but no one answered.  Daugherty said he then called the Orangeburg County Sheriff’s Office dispatch number to report what Strickland told him.  Bruce Owens, of Holly Hill, testified that he let McWaters and Strickland rent the mobile home he had at 773 Target Road.  Owens told the jury that he’d known the McWaters family for a number of years.  He told the jury that McWaters wasn’t employed and was an alcoholic.  He also told them that Strickland was employed at tried to make ends meet in the household, but they didn’t always pay their rent on time.  Orangeburg County Sheriff’s Office Lt. William McCormick told the jury about photos he took at the crime scene, which included the shell casing from the bullet that was fired, the holstered firearm and various interior views of the home.  The trial will resume on Tuesday at 9:30 a.m. The trial is expected to last three or four days.  Circuit Judge Diane Goodstein is presiding."

Langenkamp was biking in Bethesda, Maryland when the driver of a semi-truck hit and killed her while turning right into a parking lot.  ""All that white line is, is an invitation. It's a death trap to bicyclists who think they're safe because they're in a bike lane,"" Dirk Debbink, Langenkamp's father, said.  Langenkamp's family immediately channeled their pain into action by gaining the attention of U.S. lawmakers who sponsored the Sarah Debbink Langenkamp Active Transportation Act.  ""It can't bring Sarah back, but over 1,000 people are killed every year, bicyclists and pedestrians in our country -- but can we make a 5% difference? That's 50 people. Ten percent? That's 100 people that don't have to go through this,"" Debbink said.  The bill would allocate existing federal funding to allow state and local government to build safer pathways for bicyclists and pedestrians.  ""Every day the dollars sit there and not out here, it's another day somebody else could get killed,"" Debbink said.  The Oconomowoc Common Council voted unanimously to support the Sarah Debbink Langenkamp Active Transportation Act on Tuesday.  ""We're going to do our best to help this tragedy become something positive,"" Oconomowoc Mayor Robert Magnus said.  Magnus and the Common Council are sending the Debbink family off to Washington D.C. with their signed letter of support.  Langenkamp's parents, Dirk and Terry Debbink, are meeting with lawmakers, including Sen. Ron Johnson and Sen. Tammy Baldwin on Wednesday.  ""We're all in. Let's make a difference if we can,"" Dirk Debbink said.  Langenkamp's family told CBS 58 she learned how to ride a bike in Oconomowoc where she grew up. Her passion for biking carried her throughout the world in countries like Uganda and Ukraine, where she served as a U.S. diplomat.  ""She loved biking and really committed to commuting by bike in whatever country she was working in,"" Alicia Bosscher, Langenkamp's sister, said.

The incident took place about midnight on Monday at the intersection of Newark Avenue and Coles Street. According to authorities, a male in his thirties was hurt in the collision.    The car that hit him fled the scene, and officers made no mention of the vehicle’s make or model. Authorities added that the victim was rushed to an area hospital, where he remains in serious but stable condition.  The prosecutor’s office requests that anybody with knowledge of the accident contact them. An investigation remains ongoing in the meantime.    Our thoughts are with the injured victim and his family at this time. We hope for his full recovery.  Pedestrian Accident Injuries in New Jersey  According to the most recent available accident statistics, a pedestrian was killed in a traffic collision in New Jersey 27% of the time over the last year alone.  Tragically, any pedestrian in New Jersey who is out for a stroll runs the risk of being in a collision. But some age groups see more traffic-related fatalities than others. For instance, adults over the age of 65 make up about 20% of all pedestrian accident fatalities. What’s more, New Jersey ranked among the top states for pedestrian deaths and injuries.  The busy streets in New Jersey clearly pose a threat to pedestrians, but the state has passed several laws that drivers must abide by to keep pedestrians safe. Drivers that break these prohibitions may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, particularly if a pedestrian is hurt. Drivers in New Jersey have a duty of care to pedestrians, and when they fail to uphold this responsibility, they may be held civilly accountable. Although pedestrians frequently sustain injuries in accidents, you have the right to use the road safely as a pedestrian in New Jersey.  At any time and at every intersection, pedestrians have the right to cross the roadway safely while walking on the sidewalk. Drivers are accountable for maintaining awareness of their surroundings and treating every other vehicle—including bicycles, trucks, and pedestrians—with respect. People’s disregard for others causes these awful accidents. You don’t have to go through this ordeal by yourself. You need to seek the assistance of a New Jersey pedestrian accident attorney.  If you have a Jersey City pedestrian accident lawyer on your side, your chances of winning your personal injury case will be greatly boosted.

Share Copy Link Copy  Hide Transcript Show Transcript  Leo played it perfect tone which was, he's shivering. He could barely form the words, he knows he's gonna die. We've already seen that. He's made *** sacrifice for her. Of course, very controversial. You know, that he could have gotten on the, on the, the, the raft with her, but he saw that it would have compromised her safety and he kind of steps back. He did what the gentleman on the ship did. I was happy when I wrote that scene, I'll be back, I'll be back. So that, that's *** funny thing because in the script, it, it actually read, I think I'll come back and there was something about the way Arnold said it with his then quite thick Austrian accent. That didn't sound quite right. And so I said, well, just switch it to, I'll be back, you know, and he said, really? I said, yeah, and we just kind of, you know, made it up, made it up in the moment and of course, it became quite iconic. But here's the interesting thing about that line. You're watching the movie for the first time, you have no idea what's gonna happen next. And yet it still got *** laugh somehow people had gotten already. This guy was this bulldozer. You just get this innate sense of this guy as just this juggernaut. And when he says I'll be back, it's gonna be bad. So people laughed before they even knew they didn't even know what *** Terminator movie was at that point. Well, I think they were starting to figure it out. Come with me if you want to live. Terminator Two. That's the pivotal moment where Sarah has this stunning realization that the Terminator that's before her, her worst nightmare has turned into her savior and the savior of her son. And it was just *** fun moment to see how Linda would play that. We knew it was *** tough moment for her because her whole reality literally flips upside down. She played it beautifully. It's just *** nice piece of acting chicken. Oh, it's *** pure moment of exultation for him. He's just alive. He's in the moment he doesn't have *** penny in his pocket. He won the damn ticket in *** poker game. He's just living carefree fancy free. He's met Fabrizio and they're just having fun. It was an expression of life, his life spirit, which seems so unquenchable and so full of potential. Every time I'm aching by, I'm getting ready to do *** run. I'm, I'm talking to Leo on the radio. Ok. Howl, like *** wolf. You know, I got him howling like *** wolf. We tried it, you know, I don't know, 10 times and he looked great and his, his acting spirit was there, but we just couldn't quite find the right word and it just popped into my head. I said, just say, I'm the king of the world. I hear back on the lucky what I said, you gotta sell it, you gotta sell it. You know, just say I'm the king of the world and he did and he put his arms out and you feel that spirit and it became the focal point of the whole scene, the whole ship's energy, the pounding of the engines, the dolphins jumping and everything, all, you know, the sort of the beauty and the power and the majesty of it all culminated to his, his spirit at the, at the bow. Now I come along at the Academy Awards and make the classic mistake of assuming that just because we had won best picture or that, that I got be best director that everybody in the room loved the movie and would celebrate *** reference to the movie, but they weren't, not everybody voted for it, right? And the knives are always, they're, they're kind of always half drawn even when they're there to celebrate you. The knife is half out of the, out of the, the hilt. I mean out of the, the sheath, right? Yeah. So I put my foot in that one, Jack. I want you to draw me like one of your French girls, *** lot of people have, have kind of mocked and spoofed that line. But I think *** lot of people really like it. She's bold. She's taking the power. She's been robbed of power by her fiance, by her mother, by her social straitjacket. He's this devil may care, free spirit, artistic spirit, all the things that she wants to be and she just flips the script and tells him to do his thing. I think people celebrate her empowerment as *** character in, in that moment, it's also the promise of romance, the promise of sex. It's also this great liberation and it's my 40 something year old hand as Leo's 20 year old hand. But I do the, the picture and then Leo just made some head scratching, you know, while he was fiercely concentrating on, on her and pretending to draw. The only problem is I draw left handed and he was madly drawn way right handed. I should have made *** draw left handed. When you sketch, there's an arc that's formed by your wrist. So all my lines are arching in this direction. Now, I've got to do the drawing backwards. So if you look in the movie, I'm doing the outlining, but I'm not doing any of the shading. I'm doing the smudging cause I couldn't do it because the arcs were all the wrong, wrong direction. I don't know about you, but I intend to write *** strongly worded letter to the White Star line about all this. I just think people appreciate Jack's presence of mind to be taking the stress out of the situation for her by making *** joke. And Leo played it perfect tone which was, he's shivering. He can barely form the words. He knows he's gonna die. We've already seen that he's made *** sacrifice for her, of course, very controversial. You know, that he could have gotten on the, on the, the, the raft with her, but he saw that it would have compromised her safety and he kind of steps back. He did what the gentleman on the ship did when they stepped back from the life boats to save the women and Children first because that was honor and duty. I was happy when I wrote that scene. Get away from her. You ***. That's *** great uh iconic moment. The moment we knew we had them was then they just burst into wild applause on that line. They loved it. So we knew the movie had had landed. And then you realize this movie is about two females of different species, protecting their young and it's on, it was just the right line at the right time in that movie. And then the audience response to it reminded me why you do this. I was *** marine. Hey, yeah, *** warrior of the jarhead clan. My brother Dave uh was *** marine. He died recently and you go your whole life as *** marine. Jake doesn't matter where he goes in the universe if he was *** US marine at some point, he's *** marine. Only *** marine can call himself *** jarhead unless they're *** marine. In which case it's ok. So that was just *** little inside kind of marine corps reference. I put ***, I put *** few of them in, you know, kind of for my brother Dave who's *** guy that I really loved and admired. I see here, I see you, I see you as *** very important line. It resonates for people *** lot just popped into my head while I was writing the treatment in 95. And it's like, what would *** navy greeting be? You're walking towards somebody and I see you, you know, I basically kind of the simplicity of it, right? And then it started to take on various layers of meaning as I thought, well, what do people really want? They want to be seen? They want to be acknowledged, they want to be recognized, they want to be respected, they wanna be loved seeing it. It took on *** deeper meaning. Jake's kind of struggling with the idea. But of course, the whole movie is about that. The movie starts with him opening his eyes and it ends with him opening, he has woken up to *** greater experience of the world to *** deeper understanding. He's the only human that's ever truly understood the navi from their perspective and he inhabits as his avatar, he inhabits their world. And of course, he's learning from this woman that he's falling in love with. I think you're never more open than when you're falling in love with somebody that can teach you something. And so I see you took on many meanings. You know, I understand you, I acknowledge you, I respect you, I love you. There's the top layer of the movie which is plot and character. And then there's the second layer of the movie, which is thematic, right? Which is about themes of indigenous culture and human civilization, kind of at war with itself, you know, pulling us away from our connection to nature and all those, all those things. But there's another layer, there's *** tertiary layer which is mystical. If we don't service that layer as well, then we're not really doing *** worthy sequel or worthy Sequels to the first film. It continues to be important to ask the audience to see kind of with better eyes, some of the things that are, you know, our problems and our world. I mean, Avatar doesn't pretend to have some great solution. It's just saying, you know, our our our human journey is is very troubled right now. This is our whole, this is our family, this is our fortress. I question it. As I go along spending five years on essentially one ip one, you know, it's, it's 2.5 movies that we've been working on over the last last five years. You know, I question it and then I start seeing the results and then it's *** no brainer at that point. Then it just all comes to life and that world comes to life and you see the characters come to life. It's kind of magical. You know, sometimes I have to pinch myself when I see the end result of the process. So you just have to have faith in the process as you, as you go along. I knew I wanted to tell *** family story. I wanted to as an artist express some of the, the things, the ideas, the feelings that I had as *** parent and that I had observed in my kids and I'd done sort of parent child stories in the past, even all the way back to, to aliens and uh Terminator Two, but I hadn't lived it. There was *** lot of uh sort of great dramatic grist for the mill there uh around the dysfunction of families. But how there's *** strength at the core of families that helps get people through times are all in this highly angst ridden, highly anxious time. Right now. I wanted to within *** fantasy world show, special to *** young audience. It's ok even in even, you know, 200 years from now on *** distant planet, you know, kids are still gonna feel anxious or, or, or depressed or, or unseen, it's ok. You know, I'm just not only channeling my experience as *** parent, but my experience as *** teenager myself. And I just thought that that foundation of universal human experience put into the most far flung fantasy environment that you can imagine grounds it emotionally.

An online campaign raised tens of thousands of dollars, with many donations accompanied by wishes of a fast recovery for Mary Jane Mullen, a Lenape secretary for the past 61 years.  But the campaign’s tenor changed abruptly when Mullen, 79, died from her injuries Sunday.  More: Lenape team among the 15Which teams made our South Jersey Mean 15 softball rankings after the sixth week?  “The Lenape family suffered a profound loss today,” Tony Cattani, the school’s principal said in an update to the GoFundMe account after Mullen’s death.  “Mary Jane was the embodiment of all that is good in our world,” Cattani wrote.  Mary Jane Mullen spent her career at Lenape  “She felt a genuine love for all things Lenape, including students, staff, and alumni,” he said. “She was always ready with a hug, a kiss, and some candy for anyone who needed it.”  Mullen, a sophomore when Lenape opened in 1958, went to work for the school’s administration one month after graduating from Lenape in June 1961.  ""Her hiring forever changed Lenape High School,"" a statement from Lenape Regional School District said Tuesday.  Mullen sent thousands of personal notes  It described Mullen, who had led a student club for future secretaries, as ""the heart of Lenape High School.""  ""She approached each day with genuine love, kindness and caring,"" the statement said.  Over the decades, the Medford resident sent ""thousands upon thousands of personalized notes"" to students, staffers and Lenape family members, said Carol Birnbohm, the district's superintendent.  She said the notes delivered messages of encouragement, gratitude and love from Mullen, who also bought Christmas ornaments and other gifts for students and staff.  One note, written last month, described Lenape as Mullen's ""happy place.""  ""I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else. This is my home,"" it said.  Cattani said graduates who return to the school for reunion activities typically inquire about Mullen.  ""Without fail, the first thing they ask is, ‘Is Mary Jane still here?’”  A display of photos in Lenape's 1980 yearbook, Legend, shows Mullen surrounded by smiling students. A sketch depicts a harried secretary typing between wire baskets piled high with papers.  The headlines read “MJ Club” and “Mary Jane, Mary Jane, She’s Our Girl.”  Text with the photos describes Mullen as “bubbling with effervescence” and notes she “attracts all sorts to her office.”  GoFundMe appeal started on day of accident  A Lenape graduate launched the GoFundMe campaign on the day of Mullen's accident. It sought to help with Mullen’s medical costs and to support a scholarship fund in her honor.  According to Medford police, Mullen's car collided with another vehicle at Route 70 and North Main Street.  She was taken to the trauma center at Cooper University Hospital, Camden. The other driver had no reported injuries from the accident, which remains under investigation.  Mullen initially was in good spirits but still had “a long road ahead,” said the appeal, which had raised almost $50,000 by Wednesday evening.  The expressions of hope and affection turned somber on Sunday.  ""Mary Jane was a Saint to all who entered her Office Domain,"" wrote one donor, Daniel Archibald. ""She will be missed but hopefully her legacy survives.""  “MaryJane is (an) angel now and always has been,” said another donor, Susan Burns.  Cattani noted members of Burlington County’s school crisis response team and other school counselors were made available to students and staffers.  “I ask all of our members of the Lenape Family to look after one another as we deal with the loss of our friend and someone who truly exemplified Lenape High School,” the principal wrote.  He said the school ""will plan a special way to memorialize Mary Jane in the near future.""  Services will be held at St. Mary of the Lakes Church, 40 Jackson Road, Medford, where friends may call Wednesday from 6 to 9 p.m.  A Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated Thursday.

The Utah Occupational Safety and Health Division “will not be investigating the fatality specifically but looking for any safety violations that could have caused or contributed to the cause of the accident,” Eric Olsen, communications director for the Utah Labor Commission, said Tuesday.  A statement from the Clearfield Police Department said Monday’s incident at Americold at 755 E. 1700 South is being investigated but that “initial information suggests this was a tragic accident.” The department didn’t name the 38-year-old man pending notification of extended family members.  The Clearfield incident is the 10th industrial death this year. “So far this year, including yesterday’s unfortunate event, there have been 10 workplace fatalities that fall under UOSH jurisdiction and are not attributed to preexisting conditions or sudden health problems such as heart attack,” Olsen said.  The man was somehow pinned between a forklift and freezer shelves, according to the Clearfield Police Department.  “First responders worked quickly and were able to free the victim from the entrapment and rendered some medical aid on scene in preparation for transport to the hospital,” said the police statement. But he had suffered “significant trauma to lower extremities” and died soon after reaching Holy Cross Hospital in Layton.  Newsletter"

To tell the story of its accidental origin, you need to know why it's special in the first place. Ice wine, often written as one word ('icewine') in Canada, and known as 'eiswein' in its native land of Germany, is wine pressed from frozen grapes.  The flavor of grape juice comes from the various sugars, acids, and aromatic compounds it contains, but a majority of the juice (roughly 70-80%) is plain old water. When grapes are left on the vine in the winter snow, that water freezes and the flavorful compounds separate. Thus, when the grapes are finally juiced, the water content is far lower than usual, resulting in juice that is more like extremely concentrated grape syrup. After the mixture is fermented for a few months, you're left with one of the sweetest and most flavorful wines in existence. The results are rather magical, and it's all thanks to the ingenuity of German vintners, who adapted to sudden harsh conditions.  Ice "

The latest on the investigation and the injuries tonight on channel 9 eyewitness news at five. pic.twitter.com/0VNvjnyL8V — Dave Faherty (@FahertyWSOC9) May 15, 2023  NC Wildlife said the crash happened Sunday at the Riverbend Boat Landing on Eddie Nichols Drive shortly before 6:30 p.m.  The people on the Sea-Doos did not know each other, investigators said, and they don’t think drugs or alcohol were involved.  All five patients were taken to the hospital with injuries that varied from minor to severe. Investigators say there were two adults on one Sea-Doo and three juveniles on the other.  The Lucia-Riverbend Fire Department told Channel 9′s Dave Faherty they have already responded to four accidents on the lake over the last four weeks, including one drowning.  “When they’re out there riding, they’re riding erratically. And I say with due disregard, they’re just not really paying attention,” Fire Chief David Toomey said. “They’re just trying to have a good time and I understand that.”  The wreck comes one week after Willie Gray heard an out of control personal watercraft strike his dock at the home he’s lived in for more than 30 years.  “As you can see right now, it’s very calm, but on the weekends it gets crazy here,” Gray said. “And it’s still early in the season.”  Crews are urging people to make sure they use the kill switch on their personal watercraft and wear a flotation device when on the water. It’s something Tomas Suska knows all too well. He said five years ago, he was on a jet ski when he was struck and had to go to the hospital afterwards.  “Just got in a T-bone accident and didn’t have time to react. The guy was broken in two different places, so you just got to be very careful,” he said.  Faherty asked NC Wildlife about possible charges in the Sea-Doo crash they said the case remains under investigation.  This is a developing story, check back at wsoctv.com for updates.

The crash happened around 1:30 p.m. as two Chevrolet minibuses from the private boarding school in Washington were carrying team members northbound on Route 63 just before the Route 4 roundabout in Goshen, according to state troopers from the Canaan barracks.  Pena Florentino was driving southbound in a Nissan Rogue and crossed into the oncoming lane, crashing head-on into one of the two minibuses, police said. The other minibus veered to avoid the Rogue, but rolled onto its side and hit a Chevrolet Suburban owned by the Hotchkiss School in Salisbury, Trooper Rob Flanigan reported.  All four drivers as well as Florentino’s passenger appeared unhurt, police said. But all passengers from the two minibuses and the Suburban were taken to Hungerford Hospital for evaluation and then released, according to police.  Police are still investigating, but issued Florentino a summons for failing to stay in the proper lane."

(KMIZ)  A Cole County ATV crash left four kids in a Columbia hospital Sunday morning. Another man was seriously injured in Cooper County after an ATV crash Saturday. Two other reports of ATV crashes were recorded in the past week from Moniteau County and Randolph County.  An increase in off-road riders starts anytime temperatures rise, Cpl. Kyle Green with the Missouri State Highway Patrol said. But the chance of getting into an accident also grows.  “They're not toys at all,” Green added. “But that's the way many people view them.”  Last year alone, the Missouri State Highway Patrol recorded 284 total ATV crashes in the state. Over 70% of those resulted in injuries and 23 of those crashes were fatal. In many cases, Green said safety devices in the vehicle weren’t being used if they had them.  “That's unfortunately where we get many of these serious crashes,” Green said. “Where people aren't wearing helmets or they're not wearing the seatbelts and they get thrown out into the woods.”  At the same time, all-terrain vehicle crashes present a different problem for first responders. Cole County EMS said Sunday’s crash was in a remote location.  “ATVs present a little bit more of an operational issue for us,” Eric Hoy the Chief of Emergency Medical Services said. “We think there was a delay in activating 911 because they were in such a rural area that they had to get somewhere where they could actually call.”  Additionally, ambulances were not able to reach the scene alone. The EMS Incident Commander requested mutual aid for all-terrain transport vehicles from the Cole County Emergency Response Team, the Jefferson City Fire Department and Osage Ambulance District.  “It really limits the capabilities of the first responders,” Green said. “If you're going to be out on property that's in a hard-to-reach spot, hard to locate, then you need to let somebody know… in case something happens, at least we have an idea where to start searching.”  Driving an all-terrain vehicle impaired is just that too- impaired driving. In 2022, the Missouri State Highway Patrol recorded 50 ATV accidents caused by drinking or drugs.  “Operating these while impaired is dangerous for not only them but for the other people that are out on the roadways,” Green added.  In Missouri, there’s no set age to drive an all-terrain vehicle. While children under 18 must legally wear a helmet, they can drive freely on private property. In the same way, the Missouri State Highway Patrol warns it’s the parent’s responsibility to make sure the kid is ready “mentally and physically” to drive an ATV.  Wearing a helmet and seatbelt, if the vehicle has one, can decrease the chances of being injured in an ATV or UTV crash Green said. Letting someone know where you’re headed and having a way to contact 911 if needed can help emergency services get to you more quickly if needed.  Driving an ATV with the same mentality as driving a vehicle could help avoid an accident completely.  “Just be sure to take extra caution just like you would in your vehicle,” Hoy added.  Drivers can find more on ATV or UTV rules and regulations for Missouri here."
