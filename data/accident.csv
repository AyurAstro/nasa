The man entrusted with transporting him to the coroner's office has been charged with the theft of his wedding ring  Example video title will go here for this video  PLACER COUNTY, Calif. — On March 29, dedicated husband and father of two Jason Cassem was killed in a tragic accident at his rural Placer County home.  The man entrusted with transporting Cassem's body to the coroner's office has been charged with the theft of his wedding ring.  ""It's just a ring, right? But it's not to me,"" said Cassem's bereaved wife, who didn't want to be identified. She has sought an order of protection against the suspect, 55-year-old Milton Burl Boykins.  Boykins was working for A&R Mortuary Services, a Modesto-based company contracted by Placer County.  Detectives say they found evidence that Boykins stole the ring from Jason's finger and sold it at a Sacramento pawn shop. Boykins has been charged with theft and was released from the Placer County jail on bail.  Cassem's widow said she was shocked to learn that the county contracted the transport of her husband to a private company, and worries she is not the first victim in this situation.  ""I didn’t knowingly entrust this person with my husband’s care. I didn’t know any differently,"" she said.  Seven weeks after Cassem died, detectives with the Placer County Sheriff's Office recovered his ring and returned it to his family.  As they grieve, the family is still fighting to make sure the driver is convicted, so something like this doesn't happen to anyone else.  ""I will fight every day, and every minute until I get justice for him,"" said Cassem.

"accident","2015-04-20","Not Discerned","{""NewYork"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-24T16:28:06","A federal court in New York has reiterated that a time lag between the date a trip-and-fall accident occurred and when the conduct alleged to have caused it took place does not itself relieve an insurer of its duty to defend its insured in an injury suit related to the accident.  ACE American Insurance Co. has been ordered to defend Consolidated Edison (ConED) in an injury lawsuit that blames one of ConEd’s sidewalk contractors for work it did months before the injury happened.  After Altagracia Ramirez tripped and fell on a sidewalk in the Bronx on April 20, 2015, she sued the owner and manager of the adjacent property. They, in turn, sued ConEd, which they believed was responsible for work on the sidewalk.  ConEd claimed that one of its contractors, Petmar Builders, was responsible for the construction work, and since ConEd was covered as an additional insured on the ACE contractor’s policy, ConEd asked the ACE to defend it.  ACE declined to provide a defense, largely because its insured contractor’s work did not happen “on/about” the date of the accident. Because Petmar’s work at the site was completed 10 months before the accident “and the job was signed off,” in ACE’s view, there was no coverage.  ConEd countered that there was coverage for defense because even though the contractor insured by ACE completed its work prior to the date of the alleged incident, this did not eliminate the possibility that the insured caused or created the defective condition that in turn allegedly caused Ramirez to fall.  The federal court for the Southern District of New York sided with ConEd and ordered that ACE defend ConEd.  The court said ACE was wrong in arguing that Petmar must have done its work on or about the time of the accident to trigger defense coverage for two reasons: the facts presented to ACE suggested a reasonable possibility that its named insured, Petmar, was a proximate cause of the accident, and the 10-month lapse of time between the contractor’s work and the accident does not cut off the chain of proximate cause as a matter of law.  There were indications in documents that ConEd was supposed to complete a permanent repair of the construction site after Petmar did a temporary repair. But the court said that was not at issue at this stage.  ACE had actual knowledge of facts indicating that Petmar had worked at the site of the accident, that Petmar had prepared a temporary patch, and that ConEd had not completed a permanent patch before the date of Ramirez’s accident.  “These facts were sufficient to indicate that Petmar had engaged in conduct—opening and temporarily patching the sidewalk—that gives rise to a risk that corresponds to the harm that ultimately took place—Ramirez tripping and falling on the sidewalk where the work was done,” the court said.  The information known to ACE at the time of its decision to decline coverage indicated a “reasonable possibility” that Petmar’s conduct proximately caused Ramirez’s injuries. As a result, ACE had a duty to defend ConEd in the underlying action, the court concluded.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNsYWltc2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL25ld3MvZWFzdC8yMDIzLzA1LzI0LzMxNzE1My5odG3SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

A CCTV footage which is being widely circulated on the internet shows the biker losing control of this bike and ramming straight into the concrete pillar. Reports suggest that there was a 15-minutes delay in making a SOS call due to connectivity issues inside the tunnel even though it was allegedly equipped with a emergency telephone SOS systems.  The biker reportedly succumbed to the injuries he sustained on this head. As per the police, the major cause of his death was 'brain injuries as his helmet was completely damaged'.  Also, looking closely at the CCTV footage suggest that the biker has hit his head on the concrete pillar that resulted in the fatal injuries.  While Times Drive has no update on the quality/make of the helmet the victim was using at the time of accident, as reports suggest, the rider's helmet was completely shattered from the impact. However, helmets from reputed brands generally do not shatter easily and are designed to absorb just high intensity impacts.  Why good quality helmets matter?  Helmets play a crucial role in protecting the lives. As a primary safety measure, they significantly reduce the risk of head injuries and fatalities in the event of accidents. The importance of wearing a helmet cannot be overstated, as it acts as a reliable shield against potential head trauma, safeguarding the most vulnerable part of the human body.  Helmets are designed to absorb the impact of a collision and distribute the force across a larger surface area, thus reducing the chances of severe head injuries. They provide a protective barrier against head trauma, skull fractures, brain damage, and other life-threatening injuries. By preventing or minimizing the extent of head injuries, helmets not only save lives but also contribute to the overall well-being and quality of life of riders.  Why India needs to promote safer helmets? A majority of the helmets that sell in the Indian market lack safety and miss the international safety standards by miles.  Thus it is essential to recognize that helmets must meet proper safety standards and be appropriately fitted to provide optimal protection.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aW1lc25vd25ld3MuY29tL2F1dG8vcHJhZ2F0aS1tYWlkYW4tdHVubmVsLWFjY2lkZW50LWlzLWEtZ3JpbS1yZW1pbmRlci13aHkteW91LW5lZWQtdG8tdXNlLXNhZmVyLWhlbG1ldHMtYXJ0aWNsZS0xMDA0OTMyNzDSAYsBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGltZXNub3duZXdzLmNvbS9hdXRvL3ByYWdhdGktbWFpZGFuLXR1bm5lbC1hY2NpZGVudC1pcy1hLWdyaW0tcmVtaW5kZXItd2h5LXlvdS1uZWVkLXRvLXVzZS1zYWZlci1oZWxtZXRzLWFydGljbGUtMTAwNDkzMjcwL2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

It would be recalled that the National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON) on Monday stated that pilgrims would not pay the entire $250 increase in airfare over the war in Sudan but $100 as the government had subsidised the other part.  The local airlines involved in hajj operations had requested that the fare be increased by $250 over the crisis in Sudan, which would require a longer travel time to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.  The Sudanese airspace has been shut since the crisis erupted in April.  But speaking in Abuja during a training exercise organised for staff of NAHCON, state pilgrim boards and private tour operators, Zikrullah Hassan, NAHCON Chairman, had assured that the pilgrims would not be asked to bear the additional cost.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vc2FoYXJhcmVwb3J0ZXJzLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzI0L3Bhc3NlbmdlcnMtYnVzLWNvbnZleWluZy1pbnRlbmRpbmctaGFqai1waWxncmltcy1hYnVqYS1pbnZvbHZlZC1yb2FkLWFjY2lkZW500gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"accident","2023-05-22","Not Discerned","{""Brandon"", ""Mississippi"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-25T05:04:31","New You can now listen to Insurance Journal articles!  Greasy, toxin-laden wastewater discharges by a Mississippi animal feed maker were not accidents and thus are not covered by a Crum & Foster pollution policy, a federal appeals court decided this week in a case that stemmed from an investigation that led to guilty pleas by two company officials.  The U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals on May 22 upheld a lower court’s 2022 ruling in Gold Coast Commodities Inc. vs. Crum & Forster Specialty Insurance Co. Gold Coast, which made feed and fertilizer from recovered restaurant cooking oil and animal fat, asked the federal district court to declare that Crum & Forster had a duty to defend the firm in a lawsuit brought by the city of Brandon.  The district court and the appeals court declined, noting emphatically that Mississippi law, like statutes in most states, requires defense of a third-party complaint only when the complaint “contains allegations covered by the language of the policy.” The pollution liability policy covered only accidents, not the intentional, surreptitious, and repeated dumping of the oily mess alleged by the state and local authorities.  “Facially-speaking, Gold Coast’s alleged wrongdoings clearly sound intentional, not accidental,” the 5th Circuit panel wrote in the opinion.  Gold Coast’s attorneys had tried to argue that the key word in the city’s complaint was “negligence,” which arguably means the discharges were accidental in nature.  “We aren’t convinced,” the judges wrote. “Drive-by or ‘conclusory’ uses of the word ‘negligence’ don’t transform the character of the factual allegations of intentional misconduct.”  The highly publicized dumping case began in 2017, and reads a little like a crime novel. The city of Brandon, an affluent suburb of Jackson, told the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality that it suspected that Gold Coast was secretly discharging the oily, low-pH, untreated wastewater into public sewers. The DEQ and the city began investigating. Brandon crews collected samples of sewage downstream from the feed plant and found that the water was much hotter and more acidic – with high levels of arsenic, lead, cadmium, chromium and mercury, the court opinion explained.  The city filed suit, charging that the discharge from Gold Coast was so corrosive that the city had to spend significant funds repairing its sewer system.  In August 2022, the owner of Gold Coast pleaded guilty to illegally dumping industrial waste into the Jackson sewer system. A month later, the president and the plant manager were indicted on the same charges, according to news reports and the U.S. attorney’s office. An employee at an industrial services firm also pleaded guilty to assisting Gold Coast in disposing of the toxic waste.  Circuit Judged Andrew Oldham dissented from the majority in the Crum & Forster opinion. He argued that the city of Brandon’s complaint was ambiguous and did not allege an intentional act. But, he said, Crum does not have duty to defend because the tortious conduct began before the insurance policy’s effective date.  The coverage dispute was not the first for Crum & Forster over oil products in recent months. In April of this year, two Crum subsidiaries asked a federal court in Massachusetts to declare that they have no duty to defend or cover a heating oil company over its delivery of oil that contained biodiesel. The incompatible oil allegedly damaged customers’ heating systems and set off class-action lawsuits.  The Crum companies argued that class actions fall outside the primary and umbrella policies and that the oil company knew the risks of mixing the fuels. The insurers said the policies excluded expected or intentional actions that caused damage and excluded damage from erroneous delivery of liquids.

T’rique Jeffrey’s family is one of two extending heartfelt gratitude that their loved ones were able to be medically airlifted, through the financial assistance of the Calvin Ayre Foundation (CAF).  In separate flights over the weekend, Jeffrey and cancer patient Deborah Carr’s paths almost crossed. While Carr was returning home to her family after receiving treatment in Suriname, T’rique was being hurried off to a specialised burn care centre in the Dominican Republic.  Media Relations Specialist for CAF, Jamilla Kirwan, said she received a call from T’rique’s tearful mother and father late last week, requesting assistance for the US$20,200 air ambulance flight.  At the time, T’rique was in a medically induced coma in the ICU at the Sir Lester Bird Medical Center, after sustaining burns to 52 percent of his body. A medical report provided by the family indicated that T’rique had extensive burns to his left arm, chest, abdomen, back, both limbs, and face.  T’rique Jeffrey Royston Jeffrey (right) accompanied his son overseas along with the boy’s mother Latoya Jarvis (right) with Reva Air Ambulance staff  He was injured after apparently putting rubbing alcohol on his skin, before playing with a lighter and accidentally setting himself on fire.  Given the extent of his burns, the decision was made by local hospital doctors to seek transfer to an overseas centre better equipped to adequately manage his case. T’rique’s parents Royston Jeffrey and Latoya Jarvis accompanied their son to the Dominican Republic.  Royston has kept Kirwan updated on his progress via WhatsApp.  “I will always be thankful and grateful to you guys,” Kirwan said the emotional father responded in a voice note.  Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Carr’s family said they are happy to have their loved one back home and in their care.  In the request letter to the Foundation, the spokesperson indicated that Carr had initially travelled to Suriname for treatment but, due to her extremely weakened state, would have needed to return home via air ambulance, accompanied by medical support.  The air ambulance cost the Foundation US$62,000, a figure the family spokesperson said they would never have been able to afford.  Kirwan added that she sends her best wishes to both families on behalf of CAF and Ambassador Calvin Ayre, and pledged CAF’s continued support to the people of Antigua and Barbuda.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vYW50aWd1YW9ic2VydmVyLmNvbS9jaGlsZC03LWJhZGx5LWJ1cm50LWluLWFjY2lkZW50LXVuZGVyZ29lcy10d28tc3VjY2Vzc2Z1bC1vcHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Attorneys Patrick S. Montoya and Markus M. Kamberger represented Jose Cruz and his family in the case. Cruz, the victim of two hit-and-runs that occurred within seconds of each other, spent two months in a coma and over 100 days in the hospital. He suffered a brain injury, a lumbar fracture, pelvic fractures, and lost his right leg in the accident.

""We asked the jury to award the price of normalcy for Mr. Cruz and his three minor daughters. We are proud to serve the Cruz family a piece of justice from a jury of their peers.""  Mr. Cruz was stopped at a red light near the Florida Turnpike when his vehicle was struck from behind. He then exited the vehicle to assess the damage and speak with the other driver, who fled. Moments later, a second driver failed to stop and struck Mr. Cruz at 40 – 50 mph while he was standing next to his disabled vehicle. That driver fled the scene as well.  Whitfield Coleman Montoya filed a lawsuit against the two drivers on behalf of the Cruz family. On May 22, a Broward County jury awarded compensatory damages for Mr. Cruz's past and future medical care and nursing expenses, loss of earnings and ability to earn a living, loss of capacity for the enjoyment of life, disability, disfigurement, and pain and suffering, in addition to his daughters' loss of consortium resulting from Mr. Cruz's permanent injuries.

Details are here!  The problems with Tesla’s autonomous driving system (FSD) are endless. This time, a vehicle driver filed a lawsuit against the company, which was previously tried for some fatal accidents. According to the driver’s claim, the vehicle forced him into an accident.  Using the electric car sharing system Revel, Akm Şemsuzzaman claimed that Tesla, which he used for work, drove himself on pedestrians and had an accident as a result.  Tesla Returns to Court  Compared to other electric vehicle manufacturers, Tesla’s introduction of autopilot support much earlier and capturing a large user base across the USA is seen as one of the company’s greatest achievements in recent years. However, in the past months, the name of the Tesla autopilot has been involved in many accidents.  It is stated that Tesla autopilot is in control in some fatal accidents. However, it is claimed that Akm Şemsuzzaman was almost never guilty in the accident. Shamsuzamman claims that the vehicle took off without warning in a parking garage and drove into pedestrians.  The driver, who pressed the brakes to stop, states that when he realized that the brakes were not working, he drove the vehicle into an empty parking lot to avoid hitting people and forced the vehicle to crash. Shamsuzamman, who was seriously and permanently injured after the accident, sued Tesla in the New York State Supreme Court.  While the model of the defective Tesla vehicle is not specified, the case is thought to take several years. On the other hand, accidents involving Tesla autopilot in the USA continue to increase day by day. If accidents continue, Tesla could lose their autopilot licenses.

The remaining hurdles to enacting the law are the full meeting of the committee and the Assembly plenary session.  An amendment bill that calls for the government to compensate for unavoidable childbirth accidents fully has passed a subcommittee of the National Assembly's Legal Affairs and Judiciary Committee on Wednesday. (Credit: Getty Images)  The Legal Affairs-Judiciary Committee held a subcommittee meeting on bills and deliberated and passed 33 bills, including an amendment to the Act on Medical Accident Damage Relief and Mediation of Medical Disputes on Wednesday.  The amendment to the Medical Accident Damage Relief and Mediation of Medical Dispute passed the subcommittee as the Ministry of Economy and Finance, which had been negative about the national compensation system for unavoidable medical accidents, changed its stance, according to parliamentary sources.  “The low birthrate is the most important national issue, and in this context, we agree with the Ministry of Health and Welfare that the government's role should be strengthened in the obstetrics and gynecology field, which is an essential medical area but placed under poor medical environment,"" said Kim Wan-soo, director of the economy and finance ministry’s Pension and Health and Budget Division.  However, the subcommittee failed to act on the amendment due to a lack of quorum.  The amendment bill, which passed the subcommittee, provides that the state will bear the full cost of compensation for unavoidable medical accidents during the delivery process despite the healthcare provider's duty of care. Currently, the compensation is financed 70 percent by the government and 30 percent by childbirth institutions.  Obstetricians welcome the bill’s passage at the subcommittee.  “It has the important implication of making the state fully liable for no-fault delivery accidents,"" said Kim Jae-yeon, chair of the Korean Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. “We appreciate the efforts of the Legal Affairs and Judiciary Committee and the Ministry of Health and Welfare to correct a law that violated the civil law doctrine of contributory negligence by requiring physicians to share in costs when they are not responsible.”  Kim noted that some obstetricians, even after paying large settlement money, cannot leave the delivery room to raise more funds for compensative maternal or neonatal deaths that have occurred despite their best efforts, adding that the amendment gives them hope after despairing over events that happened despite their best efforts.  “We hope that the amount of compensation for unavoidable medical accidents will be adjusted to a level that reflects the medical reality, the number of delivery-related medical cases will decrease, and the reimbursement for deliveries will be raised to a realistic level, creating a more stable childbirth environment,"" Kim said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvcmVhYmlvbWVkLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVWaWV3Lmh0bWw_aWR4bm89MjExODjSAUBodHRwczovL3d3dy5rb3JlYWJpb21lZC5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlVmlld0FtcC5odG1sP2lkeG5vPTIxMTg4?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The organisations, while expressing concern over number of deaths caused by road crashes, said they would work towards meeting United Nations (UN) Decade of Action for Road Safety 2021-2030 resolution target.  The UN plan has ambitious target of preventing at least 50 per cent of road traffic deaths and injuries by 2030.  They made the pledge at the launch, induction and training programme for pre and pro-crash initiative for the road transport sector organised by RTEAN for its members in Abuja, yesterday.  According to data released by FRSC this month (May), over 40,000 people die yearly as a result of road crashes in the country.  Also, about 1.3 million people were killed, and as many as 50 million people get injured each year globally.  Speaking at the event, President of RTEAN, Musa Maitakobi, stressed the need to enhance and improve on response time at any emergency situation on the road.  Maitakobi, who was represented by his deputy, Muhammad Bushara, said members of RTEAN would be massively trained in collaboration with the Nigerian Red Cross officials to efficiently handle emergency situations at the point of accident before moving to the hospital to save lives.  Noting that Mobile Emergency First Aid Clinics will be provided on roads, the RTEAN’s boss explained that road accidents victims would also be assisted to receive first aid treatment from the point of accidents by RTEAN trained members.  He stated: “For success of this programme, we intend to embark on public enlightenment, as this is the first time any association or union in the transport sector is initiating a programme that involves lives in collaboration with other professionals and experts in the field.  “It is also our belief that, with time, more persons will be trained (as we embark on training the trainers), and the issue of travellers dying before they could get to the hospital will be minimized. And with the support from relevant government agencies and organisations, we shall succeed and the roads will be made death free for Nigerians.”  ","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vZ3VhcmRpYW4ubmcvbmV3cy9ydGVhbi1mcnNjLXJlZC1jcm9zcy1tb3ZlLXRvLXJlZHVjZS1yb2FkLWFjY2lkZW50LWRlYXRocy1ieS01MC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

A public celebration of life has been scheduled for 12 p.m. Friday at the gardens.  Courtesy photo  A public celebration of life has been scheduled for Eagle County local Nick Courtens on Friday from noon to 2 p.m. at the Betty Ford Alpine Gardens in Vail.  Courtens, 34, the garden’s curator of plant collections, died in a paddling accident in Glenwood Canyon on Sunday.  Garfield County Coroner Robert Glassmire confirmed Tuesday morning to the Glenwood Springs Post Independent that Courtens was pronounced dead at the scene between Shoshone and Grizzly Creek in Glenwood Canyon after he fell from a raft and drowned.  Courtens was born on March 14, 1989, in New York, the oldest in a family of three children. He was connected to horticulture from a young age through his family’s farm, Roxbury Farm, in the Hudson Valley of New York.  Courtens studied horticulture at the Longwood Gardens professional gardener program and came to Colorado for a summer internship at Betty Ford Alpine Gardens in May of 2010. He remained on staff following the internship, ultimately becoming the curator. He also joined Ski and Snowboard Club Vail in 2012 as a coach.  The Betty Ford Alpine Gardens described Courtens as a rising star in North American horticulture, and Ski and Snowboard Club Vail said he was a significant contributor to the freeski and snowboard community in Vail.  Those closest to Courtens knew him as a dependable friend who took the lead in helping to plan the celebrations of life for Bindu Pomery and Lily Connelly , who were both killed in backcountry snowboard and ski accidents in Vail. He was also deeply affected by the death of his friend Spencer Cooke, a Vail local who died in 2015.  Courtens was himself a talented backcountry skier and also enjoyed mountain biking, fly-fishing and whitewater rafting. He was a world traveler who ventured to Alaska for heli-skiing, Central America for sightseeing, and Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan for mountain trekking in an effort to learn more about high-altitude horticulture.  In recent years, Courtens had branched out into public speaking and had been featured at several presentations for plant societies and botanic gardens. In April he visited Vancouver, Canada, where he studied plants and gardens and participated in speaking engagements.  Courtens is survived by his parents, Kelly Testa and Jean-Paul Courtens, brother Johannes Courtens, sister Annie Courtens, stepmother Jody Bolluyt, grandmothers Meg Cashen and Corrie Courtens-Soonius, as well as many aunts, uncles and cousins.  Friday’s celebration of life will take place on the lawn at the lower bench of the Betty Ford Alpine Gardens location, adjacent to the gardens.

The hospital said on Wednesday the team conducted the rare redo surgery of the ureter via Da Vinci robotic-assisted technology to treat the damaged urethra of the patient who had suffered a major pelvic fracture and serious damage to his vital organs in a road accident.  The surgery lasted for three hours and within 4 days the patient was discharged, the hospital added.  When the man, 37, was admitted admission at Fortis Gurgaon, he was on a catheter, which was inserted into the bladder through the abdomen, and was unable to pass urine on his own. He had severe disabling complications such as recurrent stricture (narrowing of the urethra), urinary incontinence (leaking urine by accident) and erectile dysfunction. He had undergone a procedure to reconstruct the urethra twice at Zambian-based hospitals, but both times, the procedure did not yield any results. He was advised to be on a suprapubic catheter—a device that’s inserted into the bladder to drain urine—for his entire life.  Also read | AIIMS to launch surgical robotics training facility for resident doctors, faculty today  Giving details of the case, Dr (Prof.) Anil Mandhani, Executive Director, Urology and Kidney Transplant, Fortis Memorial Research Institute, Gurgaon, said, “During the road accident, the patient’s pelvis to which the prostate is firmly attached got fractured and he was diagnosed with Pelvic fracture urethral distraction defect. When there is a disruption near the prostate in the male urethra, the two ends of the urethral tube move away from each other.”  “During open surgery, it is often necessary to remove a portion of the bone to access the proximal end of the urethral tube. However, joining the disrupted ends can be challenging as suturing may not be perfect. Hence, we decided to do a cystoscopy, a procedure to look inside the bladder using a thin camera called a cystoscope, along with robot-assisted redo (end to end) anastomotic urethroplasty under general anaesthesia,” added Mandhani.  “The robotic-assisted technology made the surgery easier as the doctors could reach the areas where it was very difficult to reach with bare hands. Also, robot-aided surgeries provide ten times magnification of the surgery site. In India, this is the first time a robot-aided surgery is being done in such a case,” he added.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9jaXRpZXMvZGVsaGkvZ3VyZ2Fvbi1wcml2YXRlLWhvc3BpdGFsLXJvYm90aWMtYWlkZWQtc3VyZ2VyeS16YW1iaWFuLWFjY2lkZW50LXZpY3RpbS04NjI3OTE1L9IBgwFodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvY2l0aWVzL2RlbGhpL2d1cmdhb24tcHJpdmF0ZS1ob3NwaXRhbC1yb2JvdGljLWFpZGVkLXN1cmdlcnktemFtYmlhbi1hY2NpZGVudC12aWN0aW0tODYyNzkxNS9saXRlLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

While six passengers died on the spot, another critically injured worker succumbed during evacuation. The remaining three workers, who sustained injuries in the accident, were shifted to Kishtwar district hospital for specialised treatment.Two of the deceased workers — Itva and Rahul —were from Jharkhand while the others belonged to J&K.Police registered a case and launched an investigation, while dismissing social media rumours of the banned People’s Anti-Fascist Front (PAFF) — an offshoot of Pakistan-backed terrorist outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed — claiming responsibility for the accident. “The news circulated on social media by disruptive illegal organisation PAFF claiming responsibility for the road accident of a vehicle in Dangduru, Dachan, is fake,” SSP Poswal said.Meanwhile, according to Democratic Progressive Azad Party Chairman & former J&K CM Ghulam Nabi Azad, locals have alleged that the construction company was using outdated transport for ferrying the workers as well as not providing employees with safety equipment, thus leading to such mishaps. “So, I demand an inquiry into the allegations alongside adequate compensation by both the company and the government to the victims’ families,” he said.Condoling the tragedy, Union minister Dr Jitendra Singh tweeted: “Spoke to DC Kishtwar Dr Devansh Yadav about unfortunate road accident at Dangduru Dam site.

Driving the news: There were 2.5 fatal bicycle crashes on average for every million Philadelphia residents between 2017-2021, per data from the League of American Bicyclists via National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. That's up 9% from 2012-2016, Axios' Alex Fitzpatrick and Kavya Beheraj report.  Why it matters: Bicycle use surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving many cities scrambling to install new bike lanes and adopt other measures to keep riders safe and encourage cycling.  Zoom in: Last year, 35 Philadelphians were killed in hit-and-runs, more than double the fatalities of 2019, per the Bicycle Coalition of Greater Philadelphia, citing police data.  The deaths included bicyclists, pedestrians, motorcyclists, skateboarders and at least two people struck while riding electric scooters.  The city has tried addressing the problem by installing protected bike lanes on more than 24 miles of streets. Officials pledged to increase that to 40 miles by 2025.  What they're saying: The ""trend line is going in the wrong direction,"" Sarah Clark Stuart, executive director of the Bicycle Coalition of Greater Philadelphia, tells Axios.  Zoom out: Philly cyclists have fared slightly better compared to the national average. There were 2.7 fatal bicycle crashes for every million U.S. residents between 2017-2021.  New Orleans (9.9), Tucson (8.9) and Jacksonville (7.9) had the highest rates of fatal accidents per million residents.  The latest: Some of the country's best new bike lane projects are in Seattle, Portland and Bethesda, Maryland, per advocacy group PeopleForBikes.  Jersey City and Hoboken, meanwhile, got a shoutout for an innovative project meant to better connect the neighboring cities, which have historically been frustratingly disconnected despite their proximity and well-developed internal bike lane networks.  The intrigue: Cities are grappling not just with an upswing in traditional bicycle use, but also a boom in e-bikes used by residents, tourists and delivery workers.  The challenge is figuring out how to best integrate the zippier, pedal-assist bikes — do they belong in bike lanes with slower, traditional two-wheelers, or should they be among the cars and trucks, where Vespa-style scooters travel?  Reality check: Protected bike lanes and other measures designed to keep cyclists safe are often met with fierce pushback from urban drivers who lament the loss of any lanes or parking spots.  What's next: Cities nationwide are applying for state and federal money — including some set aside as part of the 2021 infrastructure law — to further develop their bike trail networks and other cycling infrastructure.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS9sb2NhbC9waGlsYWRlbHBoaWEvMjAyMy8wNS8yNC9iaWN5Y2xlLWZhdGFsaXRpZXMtaGl0LWFuZC1ydW4tZGVhdGhz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Soward reported that Abel Calvillo Sr., 64, was found buried under mud after the walls of a 100-foot dug out mining road collapsed on a bulldozer he was operating at the mine operated by North American Construction Group.  According to reports, Calvillo was reported missing on the evening of Tuesday, May 16 as mine crews were unable to locate him. Atascosa Sheriff’s deputies and emergency services from Jourdanton Volunteer Fire Department were dispatched to the scene shortly after 4 a.m. on Wednesday.  “We were all just together for Mother’s Day and three days later, he was just gone,” said Rebecca Pesqueda, Calvillo’s niece. “It’s hard to put into words how our family is feeling right now, especially knowing he was alone when it happened. Abel filled our lives with so much laughter and love. He especially loved the children in our family, always joking and playing with them. He loved all of us like we were his own. We miss him so much.”  According to reports, a sheriff’s office drone was used and detected a hot spot under a mass of dirt, mud and water using thermal imaging equipment on the drone. That is when first responders and mine employees discovered a small portion of the dozer blade emerged from the mud and water.  “The area was difficult to navigate and personnel searching were sinking to their waist in the mud,” Soward said.  Search efforts were able to reach the cab of the dozer and pull the victim from the heavy machinery.  The victim was pronounced deceased at the scene by Justice of the Peace Rusty Prasifka who ordered an autopsy.  The exact cause of the fatal accident is under investigation by the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration. San Miguel referred the Pleasanton Express to North American Construction Group for comment. North American Construction Group declined to comment amid the investigation.  “We are grateful to all of the family, friends and members of our community who have reached out to us, stopped by or brought us food,” Pesqueda added. “I personally want to thank Constable Cregg Thompson, Pct. 3, who stopped by that morning and offered his condolences. It meant more to our family than he will ever know. Also Justice of the Peace Judge Rusty Prasifka, Precinct 4, and Commissioner Eliseo Perez of Precinct 3 for their help that day.”  “My dad was such a wonderful and hardworking man,” said Abel Jr. Calvillo. “I’m truly heartbroken and devastated by his tragic passing. I am thankful for all the great memories we shared together. Rest In Paradise dad, I love you,”  Calvillo’s obituary states that Abel was a very hardworking man who always lightened people’s day by making jokes and making everyone laugh. It stated he was respected by many, not only for his work ethic but his character, he always made time to be around his family and friends.

Dhola was produced before the magistrate, who remanded him in judicial custody after the police did not seek his further remand.  Meanwhile, the suspect has withdrawn an application filed for permission to appear in a BA first year examination. In the application, filed through advocates Terminder Singh and Sunil Singh Gill, Dhola had stated his police custody since May 20 had caused him mental stress and left him with little time to prepare for the examination. Under the circumstances, he did not wish to take the exam slated for May 26 and sought court’s permission to withdraw the application.  In another application, Dhola sought court directions to the Superintendent, Burail Jail, to provide him medical facilities, including proper bedding due to a disc problem he had suffered in 2018. He further urged the court to put him in a barrack away from hardened criminals, considering his young age. The court ordered provision of medical facilities as per the jail manual.  The court also directed the investigating officer to submit “zimni” report (daily report) in such a way that there was very little space between the lines.

"accident","2023-10-27","07:44:00","{""Wichita"", ""Kansas"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-24T19:27:06","A former Park City police sergeant who failed to properly investigate a fatal accident and then lied about why he didn’t take extra steps in the investigation had his license revoked this week.  Christopher Shields, who worked for the department from August 2013 to November 2022, did not dispute any of the facts laid out in the Kansas Commission on Peace Officers’ Standards and Training order revoking his license. He signed the document dated on Monday.  KCPOST oversees officer certifications within the state.  Scroll to continue with content Ad ADVERTISEMENT  Shields cannot apply to be a Kansas officer again for five years.  Shields was a sergeant when he left less than two weeks after the Oct. 27 fatal accident. A call to a number associated with Shields was not answered and a message was not returned.  No one at the police department could be reached as well despite multiple calls.  The accident, based on details from the KCPOST and media reports, involved two vehicles. KSN reported that 70-year-old Paula McKinney died after she was headed west on 53rd Street South, tried to turn into a convenience store and was hit by a 26-year-old Wichita man driving eastbound. He was injured in the accident, which happened just before 6 a.m.  The police department’s procedure requires officers to take measurements involving the accident if someone is triaged code red, which means critical. Shields was “acting in a supervisory capacity” at the time of the wreck, the KCPOST document says.  McKinney was originally triaged yellow, or serious, but it was changed seven minutes later to red. Shields was not “specifically made aware” of the change but it was updated in the call’s log that he had access to.  A rookie officer asked if measurements needed to be taken, but Shields said no because he didn’t know, or check, whether the triage had been changed, the document says.  Shields called for two tow trucks.  At 7:11 a.m., as one of the vehicles was being towed, another officer told Shields that the woman had been transported to a hospital in critical condition.  “EMS told me yellow,” the document says Shields replied. “I’m going with what EMS told me.”  An autopsy says “EMS records indicated that she was alert and oriented, before suddenly decompensating.”  The second tow truck arrived and removed the second vehicle. Shields cleared the scene at 7:41 a.m. and went back to the police station.  At 7:44 a.m., Shields, now knowing the woman had been triaged in critical condition, called a captain and told him he was “unaware of the triage change until after he cleared the scene,” the document says.  He asked the captain for advice on what to do. Roughly 30 minutes later, Shields learned the woman died.  In his report Shields wrote: “Once back at the station I pulled the call on my MCT and noticed that (McKinney’s) triage had been downgraded to code red with a GCS of 3.”  GCS appears to stand for Glasgow Coma Scale, which is a measurement of how responsive someone is.  Shields also told multiple officers that he didn’t know of the change from yellow to red until he was back at the station, the document says.  “Despite his assertions in writing and to other PCPD officers that he did not know of the triage change until he returned to the station, body cam footage clearly shows (Shields) being notified of the change by another officer,” the document says. “He responded in a flippant manner and took no steps to verify the information, alter his response to the collision scene, or preserve the scene.”  Additionally, the document says, Shields later admitted to a KCPOST investigator that he learned about the triage change at the “collision scene when told by other officers.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vY2Euc3BvcnRzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL3BhcmstY2l0eS1vZmZpY2VyLWxvc2VzLWxpY2Vuc2UtMTkyNzA2MzI5Lmh0bWzSAVdodHRwczovL2NhLnNwb3J0cy55YWhvby5jb20vYW1waHRtbC9uZXdzL3BhcmstY2l0eS1vZmZpY2VyLWxvc2VzLWxpY2Vuc2UtMTkyNzA2MzI5Lmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Chris was an exceptionally warm and friendly person, it was truly in his nature to be an easygoing, approachable, and likable guy. He was also deeply dedicated to the Sacramento restaurant community and its workforce. He will be missed, and our thoughts are with his family and friends.""  We heard the tragic news today that our past Sacramento Chapter President, Chris Jarosz, passed away early this morning... Posted by CRA Sacramento Chapter on Wednesday, May 24, 2023  California Highway Patrol says, just after 2 a.m., officers responded to the westbound side of the freeway near 51st Street to investigate a crash. At the scene, officers found that an SUV had crashed into a one-ton flatbed truck.  The truck was hitched to an arrow board trailer that was activated, pointing drivers to the right. Two employees were inside the truck, CHP says.  Officers found that the SUV crashed into the arrow board trailer, then into the truck. Jarosz wasn't wearing a seatbelt, CHP says, and was pronounced dead at the scene.  Both people who were in the construction truck weren't hurt, officers say.  ""In the restaurant business, you face challenges every day, but he had that ability to make that challenge an opportunity,"" said Patrick Mulvaney, owner of Mulvaney's B&L in midtown.  It wasn't until Wednesday afternoon that Mulvaney heard the news of Jarosz's death.  ""A, it's such a shock, and B, it's so fresh that we don't even know,"" he told CBS13.  Mulvaney said his friendship with Jarosz spanned more than 15 years. Since then, he said Jarosz played a key role in elevating Sacramento's restaurant industry to what it is now.  ""We as a community, the hospitality community, have changed that, and Chris was a big part of that and we will miss him,"" Mulvaney said.  For Mulvaney, he hopes Sacramento remembers Jarosz by his entrepreneurial spirit.  ""He saw opportunities and took the bold step to make them happen, and in doing that, I would argue he made Sacramento a better place,"" he said.  The Highway 50 incident was one of three deadly crashes around the greater Sacramento area Wednesday morning.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL3NhY3JhbWVudG8vbmV3cy9mYXRhbC1hY2NpZGVudC1oaWdod2F5LTUwLTEtcGVyc29uLWRlYWQv0gFcaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL3NhY3JhbWVudG8vbmV3cy9zYWNyYW1lbnRvLWhpZ2h3YXktNTAtZGVhZGx5LWNyYXNoLWNocmlzLWphcm9zei8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"accident","2022-05-24","Not Discerned","{""Rome"", ""Lazio"", ""Italy""}","2023-05-25T01:57:00","A journey of recovery and gratitude: For the first time, star singer Yoni Z tells COLlive.com about the motorbike accident in Rome, the devastating aftermath, the ""mistaken"" request at the Rebbe's Ohel and what he learned from the year-long experience for his new single. Full Story  By Sruly Meyer – COLlive  When Jewish music star Yoni Z is asked what was the date of the accident in Italy? He answers, without missing a beat, May 24th, 2022. Clearly, this date is forever etched in his mind.  With his second album just released on Lag BaOmer last year, Yoni was set to visit Israel to promote the new album. Interviews were lined up, concerts scheduled and flights booked. After years of non-stop work, Yoni wanted to take a one-day break, a day that would later turn into a year.  Yoni made a planned pitstop in Rome on his way to Israel. While riding a motorbike, something he had done many times before in other countries, there was a pothole at the bottom of a hill he could not see. Just yards away from the famed Roman coliseum, Yoni hit the sinkhole and the force sent him forward 15 feet in the air. When he landed, Yoni could feel the bones break, in specific, 7 different areas of bone broke.  Yoni couldn’t walk. The only thing unaffected was his left arm. He spent the next 10 days in the hospital until he was medically allowed to be transported.  Speaking to COLlive.com this week, Yoni says: “I want to say thank you to Rabbi Menachem Lazar of the Chabad Piazza Bologna in Rome.” The original public hospital where Yoni was taken, was not equipped or at the level needed. Yoni credits Rabbi Lazar for saving his life after he helped him be transferred to a private clinic.  After arriving at the clinic, scans were taken and sent to 3 specialists in Israel to determine what could be done. Yoni says the doctors all asked the same question, how old was the patient? Hearing that he was only 30, the doctors agreed that Yoni could avoid surgery if he put in an intense year of therapy.  Yoni told COLlive.com that the night before he left for Israel via Rome, he wrote a letter to the Rebbe‘s Ohel in New York. In the letter, he mistakingly asked for “success in Rome” instead of writing in Israel. “After seeing what I wrote, I thought maybe I should change it, but decided to leave it,” he reveals.  Little did he know that this request for blessing would actually come to fruition, as Yoni did in fact, need a bracha for success in Rome.  Yoni arrived back in Suffern, New York right before Shavuos last year. He shoulder was shattered and he was wheelchair-bound. With his arm broken, he could not even put on Tefilin. He laid flat for another 7 weeks until taking his first step.  During this time, Yoni had to cancel his appearances at concerts, interviews, weddings, focusing only on his recovery. After working on this new album for 2 years, and 3 years since his debut album, Yoni had to stop. The energetic singer was forced to take a break.  He says that not being able to promote a new album was very hard. When people asked him if he would write any music about this accident, “all I could think about was getting my body to move naturally and be healthy.”  At some point, after starting physical therapy, which lasted this entire past year, Yoni started to see the recovery actually happen. “I told myself that I would only write and sing about the accident if I can share a lesson from it.”  To be able to see the good in anything, and to see a silver lining, Yoni could track a path from the point of his accident, a low point, to now, a high point, knowing he was able to recover, and come through something hard and come out stronger on the other side.  “The most valuable lesson I took from this was, when the accident happened, it was almost 14 years since I had started singing,” he says. “I was always running, always chasing, always trying to reach a certain point of success, but I never stopped for a moment and appreciated the journey.”  Yoni continues, “It’s like riding a train through the Swiss Alps just to get to your destination without actually enjoying what you are seeing along the way.”  When asked what this taught him, Yoni answers: “It’s not about the destination. In fact, I don’t even know if there is a destination. It’s about the journey, and the moments along the way. I’ve learned to look at things in real time, and to start living in the moment.”  Yoni pauses again, eager to show Hakaras Hatov. “I want to thank everyone who wrote to me, and visited me, and everyone who has been with me along this journey. I’m so thankful that Hashem stopped me, and put the brakes on me,it gave me a chance to see what’s happening around me. Now that I’m back on my feet, and I can jump and run, and be on stage and dance, I take every moment as a gift.”  The Energizer Bunny, as he is nicknamed, is back and you can expect lots more music to follow, and of course a third album. In the meantime, Yoni reminds us, “It’s not only about what’s happening next. It’s also about what’s happening now.”  After releasing two holiday songs, one for Purim and Chanukah, and then a beautiful song for children of special needs, this is his first original new music since that accident.  A year later, on the eve of the anniversary, Yoni held a Seudas Hoda’ah and is releasing a brand new single titled ‘Hakol Letova’ speaking about the highs and lows of the year that passed and how ultimately, everything Hashem does is for the best, in this sure-to-be summer anthem.  When asked time and time again if he would write about the events that occurred, Yoni responded, “I would only write a song about this if it brought Simcha and smiles to people’s faces, as I remain forever in their debt for Davening so much for me and learning to never take anything in life for granted.”  VIDEO: YONI Z – HAKOL LETOVA  Written and Composed by Yoni Z  Arranged and mixed by Yoni Z and Jason Goldglancz  Additional lyrics by Aryella Korn and Yael Guenoun  Vocals recorded, engineered at Jason Goldglancz studios, Woodmere NY  Mastered by Shua Sorcher  Graphic Design: Yossi Zigelboum  Special thanks to Shloimy Zaltzman  Lyrics:  עברה שנה קצת לא פשוטה  תקופות של תקווה וגם דאגה  היו לי רגעים  זה מסלול החיים  אבל קול שקט בלב לחש לי מבפנים  כל העולם הוא גשר צר  ויודעים שהעיקר לא לפחד כלל  אז זכור ת׳אמונה  מה דעביד רחמנה  כי כל מה שקורה ׳גם זו לטובה׳!  ואוו! שכח מכל הפחד  ואוו! קח ת׳כל בנחת  ואוו! אז בא נשיר ביחד  הכל הכל לטובה  ואוו! שכח מכל הפחד  ואוו! קח ת׳כל בנחת  ואוו! אז בא נשיר ביחד  הכל הכל לטובה!  צועד קדימה  כי בך בטחתי  בוחר באמונה  כי בחיים לא שכחתי  שאתה תמיד איתי בכל פסיעותי  מבוקר ועד ערב אתה נר לרגלי  יש מעלי אבא ששומע  מחזיק אותי חזק ולא עוזב לרגע  ולפעמים כשזה נראה שכלום לא הולך  מה שלא אבין היום אני יבין בהמשך  ואוו! שכח מכל הפחד  ואוו! קח ת׳כל בנחת  ואוו! אז בא נשיר ביחד  הכל הכל לטובה  אוו! שכח מכל הפחד  ואוו! קח ת׳כל בנחת  ואוו! אז בא נשיר ביחד  הכל הכל לטובה!

Moore is accused of leaving a Sept. 7 accident where a pedestrian, Jokan Vuckovic of Poland, was struck and killed by a vehicle in the 300 block of East Indianola Avenue.  When police arrived, they found Vuckovic on the side of the road with several injuries. He died later at St. Elizabeth Health Center.  Moore was indicted Jan. 5 by a grand jury.  Assistant Prosecutor Mike Yacovone, who presented the case to the grand jury, said Moore could not face charges for Vuckovic’s death because, since he left the scene of the accident and wasn’t questioned until days or weeks later, there was no evidence he was drunk or driving recklessly when Vuckovic was hit.  Additionally, Vuckovic had a history of walking in the street and there was no way to know if he somehow walked in front of the vehicle that hit him with no warning or was not able to be seen, Yacovone said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndrYm4uY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9tYW4tcGxlYWRzLWd1aWx0eS10by1sZWF2aW5nLXNjZW5lLW9mLWZhdGFsLWFjY2lkZW50L9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndrYm4uY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9tYW4tcGxlYWRzLWd1aWx0eS10by1sZWF2aW5nLXNjZW5lLW9mLWZhdGFsLWFjY2lkZW50L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Many were routine – he knew who was going to win and how they were going to win. But sometimes things don’t always go as planned – even in real life.  This past weekend, Goldberg suffered an accident while he was doing something that had also become routine to him, using his tractor.  SUPER GLUED HIS HEAD WOUND SHUT!  The 56-year-old former five-time WCW and WWE Champion posted a photo on his Instagram on Monday that showed him bleeding pretty good from his head along with blood surrounding his right eye.  “Tpost: 1, Goldberg: 0,” the wrestling superstar wrote. A tpost is a type of fence post that is usually made out of steel.  TMZ Sports was able to get in touch with a representative for Goldberg who described the injury as the former wrestler “accidentally knocking his noggin on his tractor,” which “opened up a big gash near his forehead.”  Well, that’s good news, especially because of the many fans who were worried when they heard tractor accident. Plenty had to be praying Goldberg’s accident wasn’t something like that of which actor Jeremy Renner endured with a horrific snow plowing accident this winter.  Show some respect to @Goldberg. He’s one of the most iconic wrestlers ever. pic.twitter.com/rlj6iyLkVy — Savo Babicic (@TheOneIn1000000) August 18, 2020  Goldberg’s rep said that he’ll be fine and that he was planning to “super glue” his head wound closed while anyone else would probably be in the emergency room demanding immediate action.  The bottom line is, whether it’s The Rock, Hulk Hogan, or a damn tractor, there isn’t anything that’s getting in the way of Goldberg doing what he wants… even perhaps, a return to the wrestling ring in the near term.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm91dGtpY2suY29tL2dvbGRiZXJnLXN1ZmZlcnMtaGVhZC13b3VuZC1ibG9vZGllcy1mYWNlLWluLXRyYWN0b3ItYWNjaWRlbnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

All proceeds will go to help Parks’ parents with medical expenses.  Individual tickets cost $20, though people can purchase six for $100, according to Erica Tyson, Parks’ aunt who is organizing the benefit.  The first prize is an AR-15 rifle, the second prize is a $500 Visa gift card, the third prize is a propane grill and the fourth prize is an outdoor fire pit. People do not have to be present to win.  Tickets can be purchased through the event page, by contacting Tyson (980-205-5985) or at the church on June 3.  There will also be a silent auction that day featuring 22 gift baskets, along with a bounce house and face painting for kids and food plates people can purchase.  As of Wednesday morning, 34 people are planning on attending while 79 people are interested, according to the Facebook page.  Tyson helped organize a benefit ride in April at Hwy 55 Burgers Shakes and Fries in Albemarle that raised about $6,000, she said. She also created a GoFundMe page, which has raised $5,500 to help Parks and her family.  Parks, who lives in the Millingport area, has already had multiple surgeries and her family is facing more than $200,000 in medical expenses, according to Tyson. She had six fractures in her pelvis and a moderate liver laceration, Tyson said.  Parks was injured in a March 24 accident along N.C. Highway 73. Her older sister Kaylee was turning right onto NC 73 from Nelson Mountain Road with the intention of then turning left onto Cane Drive when another vehicle T-boned the car.  Kaylee sustained no major injuries, but Parks’ cousin 7-year-old Elise Lowrance died from her injuries a few days later.  After being in a wheelchair for eight weeks, Parks has started walking with the use of a walker, Tyson said, noting she should start physical therapy next week.  “The continued support has been such a blessing to us, we are blown away by everyone that has reached out and offered to help in various way and we are just so very grateful for all that has been done for us,” Tyson said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNuYXBvbmxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMjQvYmVuZWZpdC1yYWZmbGUtdG8taGVscC1taWxsaW5ncG9ydC10ZWVuYWdlci1pbmp1cmVkLWluLWNhci1hY2NpZGVudC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

There, family, students, teachers, administrators and community members gathered to share their grief, prayers and memories of the two student-athletes, who were tragically killed in a single-car accident on County Road 386 two days prior.  Andrew Sheppard, left, and Travis “TJ” Jenkins  The vigil, hosted by the boys’ classmates, marked just one of several large gatherings held in the accident’s wake. For those who attended, the event gave them a space to remember their loved ones not for the events of last weekend, but for the impact the two will have on their lives and on the community itself.  “What a great community that we get to live in and raise our children in,” said Port St. Joe High School Football Coach Tanner Jones as he looked out at those gathered. Jones had coached both Jenkins and Sheppard through their years at the high school.  Then, he turned his back to the crowd to address the gathered family members who sat behind him.  “To the parents, what a great job you did with those two boys and the men they were becoming. The impact that they made was on not just their family and their teammates, but the community as a whole. The love and outpouring that’s come out of this shows support for you all.”  Jenkins, 18, would have been entering his senior year at Port St. Joe High School in August. He is remembered not only as a stellar athlete and a strong student, but as a leader within his teams and his school and a young man deeply dedicated to his faith and to his family.  Sheppard, 16, would have been entering his junior year this fall, and his coaches say he was expected to take on leadership roles on his teams in the upcoming seasons.  Those who knew him described Sheppard as being a true problem solver and a hard worker. He was a member of both the school’s football and weightlifting teams and was known for his reserved but kind demeanor and his friendly smile.  The high school’s basketball coach, Sandy Quinn, who worked with Jenkins, led those gathered in prayer.  “We thank you for the lives of TJ and Andrew, Lord. But Lord, this community needs you more than ever. This family needs you more than ever,” he said.  “Lord, we have cried and cried and cried, and we ask why. But Lord, we know that you know. You make no mistakes. You know the way. You know the direction. So Father, we call on you tonight, Lord. We ask, we pray for your love to continue to shine on this family, on this community, Lord. We give you praise and we thank you, Lord God, for the many memories that TJ and Shep left in our lives, in this community.”  Accounts have been established for both Jenkins and Sheppard at Capital City Bank in Port St. Joe for those who wish to make donations to their families. Funds donated will go towards helping to pay for arrangements and other costs.  The account number for Jenkins is #10001223337. The account number for Sheppard is #10001223246.  Those who are making deposits from out of town are asked to make reference to the account number and address them to:  Capital City Bank — Attn: Kristi Dorman  150 Avenue A  Port St. Joe, FL 32456.

Funeral services will be held for both Jenkins and Sheppar in the high school’s gymnasium on Saturday, with services for Jenkins beginning at 11 a.m. EDT and services for Sheppard beginning at 3 p.m. EDT.  “The strength of our community is that we can come together in good times and in bad times,” said Preacher Dave Barkalow from the First United Methodist Church of Port St. Joe, who prayed with students in the school’s commons on Sunday following the news of Jenkins and Sheppard’s deaths.  “… I wish there were magic words, words we could just say to make everything better, but there aren’t. We live in a broken world. We live in a world where sometimes wonderful, beautiful things happen and where sometimes difficult, painful things happen. So as we gather here today, we pray that a spirit of comfort, a spirit of community, a spirit of love may mark us to give us the courage to be sad and to mourn and the courage to speak of the good times and the fond memories.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vZ3VsZmNvdW50eS5uZXdzLzIwMjMvMDUvMjMvcG9ydC1zdC1qb2UtY29tbXVuaXR5LW1vdXJucy0yLXN0dWRlbnQtYXRobGV0ZXMtbG9zdC1pbi1zYXR1cmRheS1uaWdodC1hY2NpZGVudC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The minister’s proposals include harsher drunk or drug driving penalties, speed limit changes, and road education for young people. Regarding scooters, new speed limits and compulsory number plates could be introduced.  “For those who use scooters: helmet, registration, insurance and good manners”, said Deputy Prime Minister and League (ID) leader Matteo Salvini.  “There were 3,120 deaths on Italian roads last year. This is impossible: we will work on a new highway code”, he announced.  Salvini’s statements come in the wake of the latest tragedy in Rome: a 24-year-old young man was run over and killed by a van while riding home on a scooter. This is the 58th victim since the beginning of the year.  The surge in e-scooter use started during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, and within a year, the number of accidents quadrupled, often caused by driving too fast (36%).  From 2020 to 2021, according to the National Institute of Statistics (Istat), road accidents involving e-scooters rose from 564 to 2,101 and injuries from 518 to 1,980. Of these, 1,903 were drivers, 77 passengers and 127 pedestrians. In 2021, there were 10 victims, one of whom was a pedestrian.  The number of accidents with bikes (691 in 2021 compared to 240 in 2020) and fatalities (13 in 2021 compared to 6 in 2020) also tripled.  ISTAT data also show that in Italy, in 2021, only 13% of electric scooter users previously travelled by car. Before the advent of scooters, most users travelled on foot, by bicycle or public transport.

Bystander, Levan Vashakidze, told Norwood News by phone that the accident occurred at around 1.40 p.m. on Monday, May 22. When Norwood News visited the crash site later on Monday afternoon, a police car and a scooter were seen, along with some blood stains on the road beside the scooter, which was upright and located next to a pillar supporting the elevated train track over Jerome Avenue.  According to police radio transmissions heard that day, it was reported at around 1.44 p.m. that a driver of a scooter had apparently been hit by a truck and that the truck had fled the scene. However, at 1.56 p.m., according to the police radio transmissions, responding officers reportedly said bystanders reported that the scooter driver wasn’t hit by a truck and that he had allegedly been “popping wheelies” [elevating the scooter onto its back wheel while still in motion] and had run into one of the pillars supporting the elevated train track, serving the 4 line.  According to police radio transmissions, the victim was treated at St. Barnabas Hospital. Norwood News contacted both the FDNY and the NYPD for any details about the incident and both departments reported not having any information about it.  As reported, in the same vicinity, 10 days earlier on Friday, May 12, at 6.10 a.m. at least one person was injured in a two-vehicle, high-speed collision involving an MTA bus and a car on Jerome Avenue by East 198th Street, one block from the above-mentioned collision, also in Bedford Park, at 6.10 a.m. Vashakidze, who works in the area, also witnessed the previous collision, as reported at the time.  The local worker was due to send us some pictures of the latest crash. However, we have not yet received them and were unable to reach Vashakidze when we called back.  Norwood News recently reported on the sentencing of Mario Rosario on April 20 to five years’ probation and 500 hours of community service for his plea to criminally negligent homicide in the death of his son, 4-year-old Mario “Mjay” Rosario, as the two rode on a scooter and crashed into a car on August 15, 2022, as reported by Norwood News at the time. Police said the child had not been equipped with a helmet at the time of the collision.  Separately, we also recently reported on the prevalence of scooter and motorbike drivers driving dangerously in the local area.

The victim wasn’t wearing a life jacket when he was found, but witnesses believe he was wearing one when the accident happened. A passenger, wearing a life jacket, survived the accident.  “One of the things you want to make sure you have every time you go out on the water, most importantly, is your life jacket,” said Tyler Crooks, Pennsylvania Fish and Boat waterways conservation officer in Somerset County.  There were a record low number of boating accidents, 41, in 2022 that resulted in nine fatalities across the state. The 10-year average is 60 accidents and 11 deaths.  “A lot of things that we find that cause accidents out on the water are people being distracted by friends and family and not keeping your eye out over the water like you should,” Crooks said. He also points out that boaters need to be defensive and pay attention where other boats are going.  Another cause of accidents involves driving a boat while under the influence of alcohol.  “BUI, boating under the influence, is a major issue. It’s the same as driving a car. If you are under the influence of alcohol, you are going to have worse reaction time and poor decision-making when you are trying to steer your craft,"" he said.  The officers are monitoring boaters to help keep them and other members of the public safe.  “If we want to do a safety check, we’re going to be looking for things like properly fitting life jackets, one on board for every person that’s on your boat,” Crooks said.  Not all life jackets are the same.  To be compliant with Pennsylvania regulations, a person’s life jacket needs to have a label reflecting that it is U.S. Coast Guard approved. The vest should also be the right size for the passenger's age and body size.  There are a variety of styles of life jackets on the market to make them comfortable for boaters and kayakers. Some are small inflatable models that don’t have the bulk of more traditional life jackets.  In addition, depending on the size of the boat, operators are required to have a fire extinguisher, a throwable flotation device and a sound producing device like a bell, horn or whistle.

"accident","2019-01-23","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-23T20:50:00","The former safety manager at the Signal Peak Energy LLC underground coal mine near Roundup was sentenced Tuesday for conspiring to make false reports about a mine accident in which an employee had his fingers crushed, resulting in partial amputation.  Curtis Floyd, 47, of Billings, was sentenced to two years of probation and fined $2,000, said U.S. Attorney Jesse Laslovich. Floyd pleaded guilty in January to an information charging him with conspiracy to submit false statements in mine records.  In a plea agreement reached in the case, the parties agreed that a term of probation was appropriate. U.S. District Judge Dana L. Christensen presided.  “As Signal Peak Energy’s safety manager, Floyd had a duty to make sure miners were safe and protected and to document and report accidents. Floyd not only failed the miners, but he also flaunted mandatory mine health and safety reporting regulations. We expect mines and their managers to operate in compliance with all regulations, and when they don’t, they will be held accountable,” U.S. Attorney Laslovich said.  “The Mine Safety and Health Administration relies on accurate and timely reporting data to inform our investigations and address safety and health hazards. These reports also help mine operators uphold their legal obligation to keep miners safe and healthy by advising the industry of necessary changes to prevent future incidents. Floyd’s failure to report this data undercuts this system and puts miners at risk. We thank the Department of Justice for its vigorous enforcement of the Mine Act and helping MSHA protect the nation’s miners,” said Assistant Secretary for Mine Safety and Health Chris Williamson.  The government alleged in court documents that in 2018, Floyd was the safety manager at the Signal Peak Energy coal mine and was responsible for overseeing safety-related accidents and injuries, ensuring that all such incidents were properly reported as required by federal law.  Instead, the government alleged, Floyd went along when management needed an accident covered up. Floyd dropped off injured miners at the hospital instead of escorting them inside or let them go home, knowing they would lie to doctors about how they got hurt, and he let required safety reports disappear instead of making sure the reports were filed.  In early 2018, John Doe 1, a miner, had his fingers crushed while loading mining materials. The injury eventually required partial amputation. As Floyd was taking John Doe 1 to the hospital, Dale Musgrave, the former vice president of underground operations, called the injured miner and directed him to falsely claim that the injury was unrelated to his work.  Musgrave told John Doe 1 that he would make it worth his while. Floyd told John Doe 1 he would support whatever decision was made. The injured miner agreed to not report the incident. Floyd and Musgrave were required to complete a U.S. Department of Labor Mine Safety and Health Administration Mine Accident, Injury and Illness report, but they never completed or submitted a report for this incident. They also failed to report John Doe 1’s injury on another MSHA quarterly report.  “Protecting the health and safety of our nation’s miners requires a team effort, which starts with mine operators following crucial safety and health laws and regulations. When mine operators violate their obligations or attempt to cheat the system, the Department of Labor will not hesitate to use every available tool to uphold the law, including partnering with other agencies. We are grateful for the Department of Justice’s critical partnership to keep all our nation’s miners safe,” said Solicitor of Labor Seema Nanda.  In February, a rock wall in the mine collapsed injuring three miners. One of the miners, whose leg was trapped under rock, was flown to a Billings hospital. The other two men were less severely injured. One was driven to Billings by ambulance, the other by private vehicle.  MSHA has yet to file a report on the incident.  Floyd's prosecution was part of a broad corruption investigation into Signal Peak Energy’s management and operations that resulted in criminal misdemeanor convictions of the company for willful violation of health and safety standards and felony convictions of some former mine managers and associates for embezzlement, tax evasion, bank fraud, money laundering, drugs and firearms violations. Musgrave was sentenced to probation and fined $20,000 for his conviction in the case.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Colin M. Rubich, Zeno B. Baucus and Timothy Tatarka prosecuted the case. The IRS Criminal Investigation, FBI, Department of Labor and Environmental Protection Agency conducted the investigation.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFodHRwczovL2JpbGxpbmdzZ2F6ZXR0ZS5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9leC1zaWduYWwtcGVhay1zYWZldHktbWFuYWdlci1zZW50ZW5jZWQtaW4tY2FzZS1pbnZvbHZpbmctYWNjaWRlbnQtY292ZXJ1cC9hcnRpY2xlXzZmNzA0ODhjLWY5YTgtMTFlZC04ZGY4LTlmOTAxYmQ2YTBkZC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Stanton County Sheriff’s Office says just before 3 p.m. they learned of a one-vehicle accident located west of Pilger on Hwy 275. When authorities got to the scene, they discovered the roadway was covered with debris after the axles of the semi-trailer broke loose and disintegrated. Authorities say this caused the mobile home the semi was transporting to “tilt precariously off the broken trailer.”  A special crew from Fremont, Nebraska was called in to fix the trailer so it could be moved. (Stanton County Sheriff's Office)  The westbound lane for Hwy 275 was closed for nearly six hours as multiple departments worked to direct traffic around the scene while a special wrecker crew called in from Fremont, Nebraska area worked to stabilize the load and repair the axles so the trailer could be safely stabilized and moved.  It took until about 10 p.m. for the highway to be cleared.  It took seven hours for crews to finish their work so the highway could be reopened.

The video, narrated by FirstEnergy safety spokesman Max Safety, explains how to identify risks surrounding an accident, including utility poles, power lines or transformers in contact with a vehicle.  “Car accidents involving utility equipment are especially dangerous due to the potential for live wires,” Candy Webb, manager of public safety at FirstEnergy, said. “We encourage schools, driver education teachers and first responders — and anyone who gets behind the wheel — to watch and share the video, which provides guidance about the best way to handle this type of situation.”  The video can be accessed for free on FirstEnergy’s YouTube channel or on the company’s Stop Look Live safety website. Instructions are easy to learn.  More tips on staying safe around electricity and near power lines and equipment are available on the Stop Look Live safety website at firstenergycorp.com/publicsafety.  Key steps to take after an accident:  ¯ Stop and look around to identify safety hazards, including downed or damaged lines, poles or electrical equipment.  ¯ Stay in the car unless the vehicle is smoking or on fire.  ¯ Signal to others to stay at least 30 feet from the vehicle, keeping pets away as well.  ¯ Call 911 immediately.  ¯ In the case of smoke or fire, exit by jumping out and clear of the vehicle with your feet together, making sure no part of your body touches the vehicle and ground at the same time.  ¯ Shuffle your feet, keeping them as close together as possible, while moving 30 feet from the vehicle to help prevent electrical injury.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmlldHRhdGltZXMuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy8yMDIzLzA1L2ZpcnN0ZW5lcmd5LXJlbGVhc2VzLXZpZGVvLW9uLWVsZWN0cmljYWwtc2FmZXR5LWFmdGVyLWNhci1hY2NpZGVudHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(KGNS) - Deeply concerned, a family in south Laredo is voicing their uneasiness following an alarming incident involving a high-speed chase in their community.  According to the family, this marks the third time an accident in the area causes damage to their property.  The reported incident took place shortly after 3 p.m. on Monday, May 22, when witnesses saw a high-speed chase involving state troopers. The chase came to an end at the corner of Sierra Vista and Ejido with the vehicle crashing into a family’s fence and several individuals seen fleeing from the vehicle.  Of particular concern to one mother is the fact that the incident happened near a school during the time when students are being released for the day.  Councilmember for District 1, Gilbert Gonzalez said, ”There’s a traffic light coming in Sierra Vista and Ejido pretty soon, but you see, traffic is not the problem. Traffic is a problem, but now, chases have become a new problem, a modern problem that did not exist before.” Despite the promise of a traffic light installation, the mother suggests the implementation of speed bumps as an alternative solution, pointing to the lack of respect drivers in the area show towards road signage.  As investigations into the recent chase continue, authorities have yet to release information on the circumstances leading to the pursuit.  For more headlines. click here.  Copyright 2023 KGNS.

"accident","2006-07-12","14:00:00","{""Newark"", ""NewJersey"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T18:12:49","The injuries sustained by victims of motorcycle accidents can range from minor wounds to fatalities. While a car or truck passenger has some protection in the vehicle and its safety features, a motorcyclist only has their helmet and protective gear. In an accident, a motorcyclist can be thrown or dragged without anything between their bodies and the road. This often leads to severe and life-changing injuries.  Common Motorcycle Accident Injuries  In this article, we take a look at some of the most common injuries in motorcycle accidents in Delaware and across the country.  Broken Bones or Fractures  Broken or fractured bones are common in any vehicle accident and are very common in motorcycle accidents. When a motorcyclist has to stop suddenly, the rider can be ejected, or thrown, from their motorcycle, and is often launched through the air. Inexperienced riders are even more likely to be thrown over the handlebars of their motorcycle in this kind of brake dive.  A rider who suffers a broken leg, arm, elbow, ribs, or other bones requires medical treatment and sometimes orthopedic surgery. Casts are typically worn for at least 6 weeks during which the recovering victim may be unable to work their usual job. Follow-up appointments and physical therapy may also interrupt a victim’s normal working hours.  Another common fracture in a motorcycle injury is a skull fracture, particularly if the rider was not wearing a helmet. A skull fracture is a serious, and sometimes fatal, head injury.  Head trauma or Brain Injury  Head trauma can happen when a motorcyclist suffers the impact of a crash or ejection on their head or face. It can cause a skull fracture, traumatic brain injury (T.B.I.), concussion, brain hemorrhage (bleeding), seizures, and paralysis. Many of these injuries can lead to long periods of treatment, hospitalization, and life-altering physical or emotional changes. If you have been in a motorcycle crash and you have suffered a head injury or have symptoms of a head trauma, such as a headache, nausea or vomiting, dilated pupils, or seizures, you should seek medical attention immediately.  Lacerations  Lacerations in a motorcycle accident are often seen on the face, arms, or torso of a motorcyclist. If the rider is wearing protective gear, it can protect the upper and lower body but a rider’s face is usually always exposed. Lacerations will require a visit to the emergency room for stitches, at least, and may require surgery and hospitalization. They also carry an increased risk of infection which can lead to further complications. Even after medical treatment, lacerations can cause permanent scarring and disfigurement. Lacerations to the face are particularly sensitive and may cause significant mental anxiety for a victim, on top of the physical harm that they have suffered.  Road Rash and Abrasions  Road rash is suffered by motorcyclists when their skin is scraped off as they are thrown across the surface of the road. It is a severe type of abrasion or friction burn. Road rash can happen even when a rider is traveling at low speeds, and are often suffered by bicyclists too. Wearing protective gear can reduce the risk and intensity of road rash.  Like burns, road rash is graded by severity. First-degree road rash, or minor abrasions, can heal within a few weeks but severe, third-degree road rash completely strips the skin exposing the underlying fat and tissue, and may require skin grafts, cause nerve damage, and leave permanent scarring. Any road rash is painful and, like all open wounds, carries a risk of infection.  Burns  A burn is a very painful and treatment-intensive injury. Burns should be treated immediately at the scene of an accident, with follow-up in the emergency room and beyond, as medically indicated. Burns can lead to scarring, disfigurement, and infection. They can also cause emotional distress for a victim, both from the initial pain and trauma of the accident and the long-term effects of disfigurement.  Internal Organ Damage and Bleeding  Not all injuries are immediately visible. Many major motorcycle injuries are internal, such as a lacerated spleen, liver injury, or punctured lung. A motorcyclist who has been involved in an accident should always be assessed for internal injuries. An impact to the abdomen, often suffered in a motorcycle accident, will frequently lead to such injuries.  Internal organ damage can require immediate surgery, hospitalization, and a lengthy recovery period. During this time, a victim will miss work and incur many medical expenses from surgeon fees to prescription medications, and should be compensated for these losses.  Amputations  When someone loses a limb in a motorcycle accident, or it has to be amputated as a result of the injuries sustained in the accident, the victim’s life is changed forever. In the immediate accident aftermath, they will require surgery, hospitalization, physical therapy, and, perhaps, counseling. As they leave hospital and return to their everyday life, they may require modifications to their home or vehicle, and may not be able to return to their job because of their injuries.  Back and Neck injuries  Injuries to the back, neck, and spinal cord are very common in vehicle accidents. A spinal cord injury can be particularly devastating as it is associated with nerve damage, paralysis, incontinence, respiratory problems, and sexual dysfunction. A seemingly minor back injury sustained in a motorcycle accident should not be ignored. Many victims complain of minor back and neck issues after an accident that develop into severe or chronic issues.  Mental or Emotional Trauma  A motorcycle accident is a very traumatic event, and the mental distress that can be caused by an accident should not be discounted. In addition, a victim’s injuries, such as amputation, disfigurement, burns, and scarring, can be a lifelong problem, physically and mentally. Victims may suffer depression, anxiety, PTSD, or other psychological trauma. If you have been involved in a motorcycle accident, you may need to seek professional help for your mental as well as your physical injuries.  What Should You Do If You Are Injured In a Motorcycle Accident?  If you have been injured in a motorcycle accident, the first and most important thing to remember is to seek medical help. Call 911 for an ambulance if you need emergency assistance, or go to the emergency room or your regular provider for evaluation. Keep a copy of your medical reports, discharge paperwork, and medical bills.  If you are able at the time of the accident, you should take photos and/or videos of the road and weather conditions, vehicle positions, and other relevant information. Your smartphone is also an easy way to record insurance information, vehicle registration, witness contact details, and other evidence and information that may be helpful to your claim.  An attorney will explain your right to compensation after a motorcycle accident and help you get the maximum compensation you deserve for your injuries.  Will You Get Compensation For Your Injuries in a Motorcycle Accident?  An innocent victim of a motorcycle accident deserves compensation for all of the injuries and losses that they sustain in an accident, and by law they are entitled to recover the damages caused by someone else’s negligence. These damages would include past medical expenses, future medical care, lost wages and benefits, home and vehicle modifications, damage to your motorcycle, and an amount to compensate you for your physical pain and mental trauma (known as “pain and suffering.”) Unfortunately, an insurance company is a for profit business that is incentivized to minimize losses and maximize profits. This means that an injured victim typically has to fight for the full and fair compensation that they deserve and are legally entitled to after a motorcycle accident.  Do You Need a Lawyer For a Motorcycle Accident?  When you are dealing with powerful insurance companies after a motorcycle accident, it is easy to accept a lowball settlement offer that seems like a lot of money but does not in reality cover all of your expenses and losses into the future.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpkc3VwcmEuY29tL2xlZ2FsbmV3cy93aGF0LWFyZS1jb21tb24taW5qdXJpZXMtaW4tYS0zOTc0NTMxL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"accident","2023-05-05","Not Discerned","{""Dallas"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T18:58:08","An 8-year-old Texas boy riding in a truck with his mother on Friday afternoon was killed in an accident after a truck allegedly blew a stop sign at an intersection, striking the vehicle carrying the child.  The boy, Thomas Berry, was pronounced dead after being transported to a hospital in Dallas while his mother, 48-year-old Tara Lynn Wright-Berry, was taken to a local hospital in Canton, Texas, with non-life-threatening injuries.  Police say the accident happened 11 miles southwest of Canton and that the driver of the other truck, Miguel Castro-Govea, 31, was arrested for allegedly causing the crash. He was first taken to the same Canton hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.  The driver was charged with criminal negligent homicide and is being held in the Van Zandt County Jail, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety. It's not immediately clear if he has entered a plea or retained an attorney.  Both vehicles were 2017 pickup trucks, say authorities.  Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage? Sign up for PEOPLE's free True Crime newsletter for breaking crime news, ongoing trial coverage and details of intriguing unsolved cases.  Meanwhile, the Berry family is mourning the loss of a son they say loved baseball.  “Thomas was on the Canton Astros coach pitch baseball team,” the family said in a GoFundMe page, which has raised tens of thousands of dollars in recent days to aid the family. “He was excited to play on the team because his favorite color was orange. He loved playing with his teammates and had found a new spot as the Astros catcher.”  Tara said her son “was so excited about baseball this year that he even slept in his hat and jersey some nights,” according to the fundraiser page, which noted the crash took place near the family’s home.  Jenny Wells-Fain, who helped coach Thomas’ team and launched the GoFundMe to support the family, tells PEOPLE she remembers Thomas “had a great attitude about everything.”  He was also brave, his coach says, recalling a time when the team needed someone to play catcher last-minute: “Thomas threw his hand up and said, ‘I would like to do it!’ “ she remembers.  “He always had a positive attitude and he was the ultra caring type of kid,” Wells-Fain says. “Always very funny, but just very sweet to everybody.”  Thomas’ team played their first game without him Monday night, which Wells-Fain says became more of a “beautiful tribute” than a usual little league game. The team hung Thomas’ jersey up in the dugout, while one of his two older sisters led the group around the bases so he could symbolically score the team’s first run. Before the game, Wells-Fain says their opponents walked over each carrying an orange rose – the color of Thomas’ Canton Astros team – and the kids shared memories about him before the first pitch.  “It wasn’t just our team that was affected,” she says. “This is a small community where everybody on every team knew him. There's only one elementary school in Canton, Texas, so all of those kids are going to the same school, so there's a lot of players on the other teams that were very close friends with Thomas. It affected our community as a whole.”  The community has stepped up to help the family too, with many neighbors dropping off groceries and household supplies.  The Canton Youth Recreation Association said on Facebook that it will host a benefit baseball tournament in June, with “only one goal and that is to raise as much money to help the Berry family in a time that we wish on no one.”  Police say an investigation into the crash is still ongoing. It was a cloudy day, but road conditions were listed as dry, according to the Texas Department of Safety report. Both Thomas and his mother were wearing their seatbelts, the report says.  A funeral for Thomas will be held Sunday in Canton.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlLmNvbS90ZXhhcy1ib3ktOC1raWxsZWQtaW4tY2FyLWFjY2lkZW50LTc1MDE3NTLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The 56-year-old WWE Hall of Famer revealed Tuesday on Instagram that he gashed his head in a tractor accident, captioning the gnarly photo, “#Tpost 1, Goldberg 0.”  A rep for Goldberg told TMZ that the wrestler “accidentally knocked his noggin on his tractor” while doing work on his property.  Goldberg is most famous for his streak that occurred when he made his professional wrestling debut in WCW, and proceeded to go 173-0.  After more than a decade away from WWE, Goldberg returned to the ring in 2016, and had matches with Brock Lesnar, Kevin Owens, Bray Wyatt, Drew McIntyre, the Undertaker and Roman Reigns.  He spoke to The Post’s Joseph Staszewski last year about what he loved most about his comeback.  WWE legend Bill Goldberg shared photos of a bloody head gash he suffered.

Washington County officials are saying that the accident took place on May 19. A vehicle containing five teenage girls overturned in the roadway.

A full investigation into the collision remains ongoing at this time.  Liability For White Creek Car Accidents  Car accidents are one of the leading causes of serious injury and death in the United States. According to the Centers For Disease Control, “Reducing motor vehicle crash deaths was one of the great public health achievements of the 20th century for the US. However, more than 32,000 people are killed and 2 million are injured each year from motor vehicle crashes.” Larger vehicles can be particularly dangerous for a number of reasons.  They have a high center of gravity and are more prone to tipping over.  Larger vehicles weigh more and are more prone to breaking down if not properly maintained.  Larger vehicles have large blind spots that can obscure the presence of smaller vehicles.  Any person that is injured in a car accident may have legal recourse through a bodily injury claim. Damages in a civil claim can help cover lost wages, medical bills and pain and suffering. It is extremely important that evidence is properly preserved after an accident. A personal injury attorney can examine all of the unique facts of your case and let you know what your legal options are.  Investigating A New York Car Accident  We at Gersowitz Libo & Korek, P.C. extend our best wishes to all of the people injured in this collision.

They are stationed at U.S. Coast Guard Maritime Safety and Security Team Seattle (91101).  The three members were returning to Coast Guard Base Seattle after their lunch break when they saw dark smoke. The crew parked to investigate. Two cars had collided and one of the cars turned over in the collision. White, Collins, and Walp assisted emergency services in recovering the individual in the turned over vehicle.  During the rescue, White climbed onto the vehicle and used a hammer to break the window.  “After arriving on scene, we knew it was bad and immediately jumped into action,” said White. “I quickly assessed how to free the trapped passenger and planned how to get him out safely and quickly. After we got him out and to safety, it was clear he needed medical attention. We conducted first aid and monitored him until emergency services arrived.”  Collins and Walp assisted White in pulling the individual out of the vehicle and transferring him to emergency medical services.  “When we smelled the fuel and saw it leaking onto the hot exhaust system, we knew we needed to act quickly. I jumped up on the van and helped Erick pull the guy from his van and got him off and to the side as fast as we could. I was terrified that if I didn’t act that something bad would happen to the trapped passenger, we had to get him out and to safety,” said Collins.  Walp also assessed the situation to make sure everyone on scene was safe.  “I checked the other vehicle for passengers and cleared away the bystanders. The hazardous cargo in the van and the leaking fuel could have created a much bigger accident and injured a lot more people making it crucial that they stay back,” said Walp.  “Coast Guardsman possess an innate, unwavering drive to rescue and protect those in need,” said Lt. Karrie A Jeffries, the executive officer of MSST Seattle. “Their commitment to saving the individual exemplify the highest standards of integrity and selflessness.

A public celebration of life has been scheduled for 12 p.m. Friday at the gardens.  Courtesy image  A public celebration of life has been scheduled for Eagle County local Nick Courtens on Friday from noon to 2 p.m. at the Betty Ford Alpine Gardens in Vail.  Courtens, 34, the garden’s curator of plant collections, died in a paddling accident in Glenwood Canyon on Sunday.  Garfield County Coroner Robert Glassmire confirmed Tuesday morning to the Glenwood Springs Post Independent that Courtens was pronounced dead at the scene between Shoshone and Grizzly Creek in Glenwood Canyon after he fell from a raft and drowned.  Courtens was born on March 14, 1989, in New York, the oldest in a family of three children. He was connected to horticulture from a young age through his family’s farm, Roxbury Farm, in the Hudson Valley of New York.  Courtens studied horticulture at the Longwood Gardens professional gardener program and came to Colorado for a summer internship at Betty Ford Alpine Gardens in May of 2010. He remained on staff following the internship, ultimately becoming the curator. He also joined Ski and Snowboard Club Vail in 2012 as a coach.  Support Local Journalism Donate    The Betty Ford Alpine Gardens described Courtens as a rising star in North American horticulture, and Ski and Snowboard Club Vail said he was a significant contributor to the freeski and snowboard community in Vail.  Those closest to Courtens knew him as a dependable friend who took the lead in helping to plan the celebrations of life for Bindu Pomery and Lily Connelly, who were both killed in backcountry snowboard and ski accidents in Vail. He was also deeply affected by the death of his friend Spencer Cooke, a Vail local who died in 2015.  Courtens was himself a talented backcountry skier and also enjoyed mountain biking, fly-fishing and whitewater rafting. He was a world traveler who ventured to Alaska for heli-skiing, Central America for sightseeing, and Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan for mountain trekking in an effort to learn more about high-altitude horticulture.  In recent years, Courtens had branched out into public speaking and had been featured at several presentations for plant societies and botanic gardens. In April he visited Vancouver, Canada, where he studied plants and gardens and participated in speaking engagements.  Courtens is survived by his parents, Kelly Testa and Jean-Paul Courtens, brother Johannes Courtens, sister Annie Courtens, stepmother Jody Bolluyt, grandmothers Meg Cashen and Corrie Courtens-Soonius, as well as many aunts, uncles and cousins.  Friday’s celebration of life will take place on the lawn at the lower bench of the Betty Ford Alpine Gardens location, adjacent to the gardens.

Her family says it happened after her horse spun and fell on top of her. She’s been in the ICU for a week, but her dad tells Arizona’s Family she is slowly making progress.  Marino Sperandeo says his daughter, Emmie, will soon be moving into the neurological ward, where she will go through extensive physical therapy. He says the accident happened just a month after she was thrown from a bucking horse that left her with a concussion and a broken finger.  Sperandeo says Emmie has always had a love for animals. He says she was inspired by Western living and her social media knowledge, which drove her to become an influencer. “Pretty much all of her income is derived from social media efforts,” he said.  Thousands have been following her journey for several years. She’s traveled and worked in several different continents, countries and states. Most recently, she was sharing her journey from Montana to Arizona. But last week, her dad says Emmie was involved in an accident involving one of her horses. “She was holding on to the horse and was whip lashed by the horse as it fell sideways. That caused her head to hit the floor,” he said.  Sperandeo says her horse fell on top of her and fractured her head in two different places. “It hit hard enough that people from 100 yards away could hear the impact of her head on the ground,” he said.  Right now, he says all she can remember are memories from 7 to 14 years ago. Another aspect that has her family worried is that by law, she was dropped from her family’s insurance after turning 26. “She’s 27 now and since then she got dropped off my insurance probably less than a year ago. When that happened I don’t know if she went out and got the Affordable Care Act or got Medicare or supplemental health insurance,” Sperandeo said.  While there are so many questions about financials and recovery, Emmie’s dad says there is no doubt her hundreds of thousands of followers have provided love and support. “She’s a tough kid but she’s got a long road ahead of her,” he said.  Emmie has several animals, and her family is working to figure out how to get the dog and horses from Arizona to Florida, where they live. They say her bison will most likely have to go to Montana.

One person involved in the collision said the cause was a vehicle that drifted into oncoming traffic. The accident happened along Grant Line Road between White Rock and Douglas Roads around 1:37 p.m.  Injuries Reported in Three-Vehicle Car Accident  A report about the accident issued by the responding California Highway Patrol (CHP) officers said the vehicles involved in the crash included a Ford F-150 pickup pulling a fifth-wheel trailer and a Honda. The individual in the Honda appeared to have suffered injuries in the crash. Two of the vehicles were left blocking the southbound lanes, while the truck and trailer blocked the west edge of the roadway. The incident is being investigated by CHP traffic accident personnel to determine the cause and to assign fault.  Why a Driver Would Suddenly Cross Into Oncoming Traffic  One of the most dangerous behaviors on the road is when a driver suddenly veers across into oncoming traffic. This can have devastating consequences, and yet it happens all too frequently. There are several potential reasons why a driver might cross into oncoming traffic and cause a car accident.  A distracted driver may not be paying attention to what is going on around them and may not realize they are about to cross the yellow line. Distractions can include texting or talking on a cell phone, putting on makeup, eating, fiddling with the radio, or any number of other activities. In these cases, the driver is simply not paying attention and their lack of focus could have deadly consequences.  Impairment can also determine why a driver might cross into oncoming traffic. Impairment includes any substance or condition that may reduce the ability of a driver to operate their vehicle safely, such as alcohol , drugs or medical issues.  Inexperience can often lead to an inexperienced driver not understanding where the yellow line is or being unable to react quickly enough when they realize they are about to cross it.  Fatigue can lead to a driver crossing into oncoming traffic if they nod off while driving.

A friend of the teenager took it and left the area, according to police. What was found was a 9 mm casing.  A 14-year-old was found nearby with a stab wound to his upper back. Police currently believe that injury occurred in a separate incident from the accidental shooting.  Both teens were taken to the hospital.  This incident comes less than a month after four men and a 16-year-old boy were shot on May 7 while sitting on the curb drinking on the 400 block of Redwood Avenue. In that case, an unidentified man walked up to the group and began firing. All five were taken to the hospital with serious but not life-threatening injuries.  One year ago, attendees at Redwood City’s Fox Theater where Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai was speaking, were told to sit tight before leaving due to 150-200 teens across the street at Courthouse Square shooting off fireworks.  As officers arrived, the group began to throw things at them. Two of the teens began to fight the officers, police said at the time.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vcGFkYWlseXBvc3QuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMjIvYm95LXB1dHMtZ3VuLWluLXdhaXN0YmFuZC1zaG9vdHMtaGltc2VsZi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"accident","2022-12-01","Not Discerned","{""NewYork"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T00:07:37","The year 2022 marked the year that drug tests administered after workplace accidents showing positive results for marijuana reached the highest level in 25 years, according to a recent Quest Diagnostics analysis.  The Quest Diagnostics analysis, unveiled Thursday, showed that positive marijuana urine tests after workplace accidents among the general U.S. workforce hit 7.3% last year. In 2021, it was slightly lower at 6.7%.  For its entire analysis, Quest Diagnostics looked at more than 10.6 million drug test results. Those results, which had a timeframe of January to December 2022, came from urine, hair and oral-fluid drug tests.  The higher percentage had a correspondence with the move by some states to make usage of marijuana legal, the workplace drug testing provider suggested.  A total of 22 states have made recreational marijuana use legal, with Colorado and Washington state having led the way starting 11 years ago. Included in the states that have done so are California, Arizona and Massachusetts, among others. D.C. has legalized it as well.  MEDICAL MARIJUANA DISPENSARIES OPEN IN GEORGIA: ‘IMPROVED QUALITY OF LIFE’  Meanwhile, the drug has legal approval for medical use in more than three dozen states, the National Conference of State Legislatures said.  Quest Diagnostics found that the percentage of people in the general U.S. workforce that tested positive for marijuana came in at 4.3% in 2022. That marked an increase from the prior year, when it reported 3.9%.  The analysis also looked at how positive worker marijuana tests differed in states based on the legality status of the substance.  ""In the general U.S. workforce, states that have legalized recreational and medical marijuana use exhibit higher positivity rates that the national average,"" Quest Diagnostics Senior Director of Science for Employer Solutions Dr. Suhash Harwani said in the press release. ""States that have not legalized marijuana appear to have positivity rates below the national averages.""  Where people are legally allowed to use it recreationally, the percentage was 5.7%, Quest Diagnostics said. About 3.9% of the general U.S. workforce tested positive for marijuana in states permitting medical usage. In states barring both, the rate was 3.1%.  All three categories saw increases year over year, according to the analysis.  Quest Diagnostics credited higher shares testing positive for marijuana and amphetamines with boosting the overall drug positivity rate for general U.S. workers in urine tests. For amphetamines, it went from 1.3% in 2021 to 1.5% in 2022.  AMERICANS SPENT MORE ON LEGAL CANNABIS IN 2022 THAN CHOCOLATE, BEER: REPORT  The rate for drugs overall, at 5.7%, was up slightly from 2021, according to the analysis.  ""Year-over-year and five-year data point to continuously higher workforce drug positivity overall, by industry, and across multiple drug categories,"" Harwani also said. ""As employers express concerns for employee health, wellness and safety, they may want to consider these data as a warning sign, particularly as a growing body of science demonstrates the risks of marijuana to mental and physical health.""  Among more than 9 million urine drug tests of the general workforce and ""federally mandated, safety-sensitive"" workforce, 4.6% had positive results, Quest Diagnostics found. That percentage was the same year over year, it noted.  The practice of employers subjecting their staffers to drug testing has become more and more debated over the years.  NEW YORK PREPARED TO ISSUE 300 LEGAL POT DISPENSARY LICENSES  Among all Americans, roughly 18% reported in 2019 at least one instance of them using marijuana, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The percentage of Americans that said ""yes"" when asked about whether marijuana should become legal has been flat for three years, with 68% expressing that position in 2022, 2021 and 2020, according to a Gallup poll from November.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvcG9zaXRpdmUtbWFyaWp1YW5hLXRlc3RzLWZvbGxvd2luZy13b3JrcGxhY2UtYWNjaWRlbnRzLWhpZ2hlc3QtMjUteWVhcnPSAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL3Bvc2l0aXZlLW1hcmlqdWFuYS10ZXN0cy1mb2xsb3dpbmctd29ya3BsYWNlLWFjY2lkZW50cy1oaWdoZXN0LTI1LXllYXJzLmFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"accident","2023-05-23","19:00:00","{""Kisumu"", ""Nyanza"", ""Kenya""}","2023-05-22T21:02:56","Accidents can happen anytime, anywhere, resulting in injury, disability and, in a worst-case scenario, death.  That could spell financial catastrophe for the victim and their dependants if the breadwinner dies or is incapacitated.  Personal accident insurance is the best way to cushion individuals and families from the economic vagaries of accidental death and injury.  Its unique benefit is, it provides financial backup for the insured in case of temporary or permanent disability. It also caters to hospital bills up to a specific limit and the costs of artificial appliances such as crutches, hearing aid and prosthetics.  Many people are still not covered yet anybody who is likely to be financially impacted by being out of work due to accident-related injuries must possess this policy.  Fortunately, with as little as Sh228, for instance, a student can now purchase an annual personal accident cover, one of the most affordable. And being in the Digital Age, one only requires a smartphone or other internet-enabled computer device to sign up and get a cover in a few minutes, from anywhere.  So, why are people, especially the tech-savvy youth, uninsured? In the challenging economic environment, insurance may be perceived as an expensive luxury. But with the high number of road fatalities and injuries, personal accident insurance is critical. Statistics show 3,000 Kenyans, or one in 15,000, are likely to perish in a road crash every year.  With the ever-present threat of physical injury, the benefits of being insured outweigh the cost, especially considering the likely loss of income due to hospitalisation for prolonged periods. Besides, innovative technologies allow for the personalisation of underwriting products.  Data analytics, for instance, gives insurers a deeper view into the behaviours of their clients, helping them to customise solutions to their financial and insurance needs.  Financial technology firms specialising in providing insurance solutions, insurtech, has lent impetus to the increased adoption of digital channels in underwriting. Insurer and insured enjoy numerous benefits—including improved operational efficiency, faster claims processing, reduced costs and enhanced client experience. Underwriters should deploy insurtech platforms to attract young people, driving generational brand loyalty for insurers. Kenyan youth are a vastly under-served market with unique attitudes to insurance.  A survey in Kenya three years ago revealed that 89 per cent of the youth would opt for health insurance with 56 per cent for motor insurance and 48 per cent education insurance. It was explained that young people highly value their well-being.  Sensitising the youth on personal accident insurance can drive uptake among this highly dynamic group. Mobile-enabled insurtech apps are a plausible way of delivering insurance coverage to underserved markets like the youth. Insurers and intermediaries should focus on selling the financial benefits of personal accident insurance while simplifying products using innovative digital solutions.

It started almost by accident, but for 10 years has made people take me more seriously.  ""Talking through a man's voice helped me be able to ask for things I never would've asked for as myself,"" says Jamira Burley. Source: Jamira Burley  Jamira Burley, 34, works in the tech industry and has a fake personal assistant named Matt.  She says people treat you differently when they think you have an assistant — especially a male assistant.  As a woman of color who works in tech, Burley has felt more confident when she pretends to be Matt over email.  This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jamira Burley, a 34-year-old who works in the tech industry. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.  Scroll to continue with content Ad ADVERTISEMENT  I have a secret to tell you.  For the last 10 years, I've had a fake assistant. His name is Matt, and he answers emails for me. He negotiates rates, schedules meetings, and rejects offers that aren't up to par.  He also doesn't exist.  I created my fake personal assistant, Matt, a decade ago  It happened almost by accident. I had made a separate email account for people to contact me with opportunities, and I got an email where the person seemed to assume that a third person, like an assistant, was manning the contact email address.  And I just rolled with it.  My name is not a blank slate, like Matt's is  You read it and you can tell it's not American. You can also guess that I'm a woman.  As a woman of color who works in tech, I'm often the only person like me in the room. Having ""Matt"" on my side — a person who could be a white man — made me feel more confident. Talking through a man's voice helped me be able to ask for things I never would've asked for as myself.  People took me more seriously as a professional because I had an assistant  I immediately noticed that Matt garnered a level of respect that I, as Jamira, didn't. People would offer me more money when Matt was involved, and they treated me as more of a force to be reckoned with.  And when an opportunity didn't work out, it was easier to have Matt say no to something than to do it myself.  Creating Matt felt like cracking a code, but it didn't always feel good  I had figured out how to make people take me more professionally, but it was by using a fictitious white man as a go-between.  I try to remind myself that to change the rules of the game, you have to get yourself into the room first. Matt helped me get into more rooms.  Luckily, someone only asked to speak to Matt on the phone once. I asked one of my brothers to get on the phone and pretend to be Matt, which he did. I think people don't usually ask to actually speak to him because I have a deck of all my offerings that Matt would send out so all their questions are already answered.  My fake Matt is actually based on a real Matt  The real Matt is a close friend who doesn't know that he's the inspiration for my fake assistant. I met Matt in high school, and I was so impressed by his ability to believe he's deserving of opportunities that come to him.  He never seemed surprised when things worked out. As a white man, he moved through the world with a confidence that it seemed like he was almost born into.  I wanted to emulate it, so I did. He doesn't know that I've been using him as inspiration for my fake assistant's persona for more than a decade, and he won't know until he reads this. But I think he'll think it's funny.  Story continues  I posted a TikTok about my fake assistant  It's been viewed more than 550,000 times and liked more than 81,000 times.  ""People treat you entirely different when they think you have an assistant, and also when that assistant is male,"" I said in the video. By posting it, I realized that many more women than I thought do the same thing I've done.  And it's not just women or women of color who do this — it's disabled people or people who are a part of any minority group.  I've grown a lot in my decade with Matt  This is what I've learned: We all have to move through the world with the certainty and confidence of a white man. We are just deserving.  And until we can ask for what we need ourselves, have Matt ask for you.

The lawsuit aims to seek justice and accountability for the tragic car crash that claimed the life of Deputy Daniel Kin. Filed in Franklin County, the lawsuit holds Short responsible for the alleged negligence that led to the untimely death of Daniel Kin and the subsequent damages suffered by his family. The legal representation for the lawsuit is being provided by Jedidiah Bressman at Bressman Law.  “Police officers, just like the rest of us, deserve to be protected,” Bressman said in a press release. “Defendant Short has failed to take accountability for his actions.”  According to the lawsuit, on or about December 15, 2022, Deputy Daniel Kin was carrying out his duties as a deputy for the Wyandot County Sheriff’s office, transporting an inmate in a sheriff’s vehicle on Route 104 in Pickaway County, Ohio. Tragically, the vehicle operated by Daniel Kin was struck by defendant Steven Short’s motor vehicle, resulting in severe injuries and subsequent pain for Daniel Kin. Despite the efforts of medical professionals, Daniel Kin passed away.  The lawsuit alleges that the negligence of Short directly and proximately caused the collision and subsequent death of Daniel Kin. The complaint highlights the intense pain endured by Daniel Kin during treatment and his transportation to the hospital, citing it as a direct result of Short’s alleged negligence.  Left behind in the wake of this devastating loss are Daniel Kin’s wife, Erin Kin, and their two children. The lawsuit emphasizes that the alleged negligence of Short has caused immeasurable emotional suffering and significant financial burdens for Daniel Kin’s surviving family.  Erin Kin is seeking damages exceeding $500,000, reflecting the injuries and losses suffered as a direct and proximate result of Short’s alleged negligence. Although the exact financial extent of the damages cannot be specified at this time, the lawsuit underscores the significant impact it has had on the family’s livelihood.  Erin Kin and her legal team are determined to pursue justice and accountability in this matter.

"accident","2019-05-05","16:48:00","{""Indianapolis"", ""Indiana"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T18:49:13","Stefan Wilson was taken to hospital after he and Katherine Legge crashed together during Monday afternoon’s post-qualifying practice for the upcoming Indianapolis 500.  The incident occurred with 48 minutes remaining in the two-hour session. In a pack of traffic, Wilson appeared to slow through the apex of turn one, and Legge struck him from behind, pitching both cars towards the SAFER barrier. Wilson’s #24 Cusick Motorsports car spun 360 degrees and hit the barrier head-on, while Legge’s #44 Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing car hit the wall right-side first and momentarily lifted into the air.  Wilson was extracted out of his car by the IndyCar safety team and loaded onto a stretcher with a neck brace fitted. Wilson gave a thumbs up to the crowd before he was transported directly to Indiana University Methodist Hospital, bypassing the Indianapolis Motor Speedway’s care centre.  Legge walked away seemingly unhurt from the incident, and was then evaluated and released from the care centre. IndyCar medical director Dr. Julia Vaizer said that Wilson was awake and alert following the accident.  “I can tell you that he [Stefan] is doing well,” said Dr. Vaizer. “He’s being transported to a local hospital for advanced imaging and further evaluation, but he is in good spirits.”  Speaking to NBC after the accident, Legge said she had little explanation for the accident.  “The cars in front were all checking up and I lifted as much as I could, downshifted, hit the brakes, but it wasn’t enough as they were checking up,” she said. “I got into the back of Stefan and we both ended up in the wall.”  The crash is further headache for RLL, who lost Graham Rahal’s #15 car from Sunday’s race after he was bumped out of qualifying by Jack Harvey.  “I know that its another blow to the team,” said Legge. “After yesterday, those guys don’t deserve it. It’s not right.”  This was the first significant crash throughout the entire Indianapolis 500 race meeting. Both days of qualifying and the preceding three days of practice were run without any crashes.  Wilson, 33, qualified for his fifth Indianapolis 500 on Saturday, and is due to start 25th in this Sunday’s race. His best finish in four previous attempts is 15th in 2018, a race in which he led three laps while bidding to win the race on a fuel strategy gamble.  The youngest of two racing brothers from Sheffield, Stefan has been taking part in the Indianapolis 500 in tribute to his older brother Justin, a multi-time IndyCar Series race winner and Formula 1 driver who died due to injuries sustain a crash during the 2015 IndyCar Pocono 500.

(WFIE) - The Tri-State has recently seen accidents and deaths related to off road vehicles.  Safety when enjoying the outdoors is important to remember this time of year.  On Monday, family and friends buried 16-year-old Landon Grigg of Hopkins County after a side-by-side accident.  An accident also happened Sunday in Webster County, where a motocross rider was injured at the Echo Valley complex.  With the warm weather approaching, outdoor activities become more popular. Safety should always be considered when it comes to outdoor activities.  Since school is out for the summer, kids have more free time to ride ATVs, RTVs, dirt bikes, and UTVs recreationally.  Indiana has a helmet law where anyone under the age of 18 has to wear a helmet while on or in any off-road vehicle or they could receive a $500 fine.  Indiana Conversation Officer Ryan McIntyre shared tips to stay safe while riding.  “Watch your speed, wear a helmet, wear as much ATV safety gear as you can, and just be safe,” says McIntyre.  We reached out to Webster County officials for more information on the accident that happened over the weekend and are waiting to hear back.  We will update you as we learn more.

"accident","2005-09-13","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T16:42:11","On September 13, 2005, a disease began to spread in the massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) World of Warcraft.  An update to the game had introduced a new area for higher-level players, known as Zul'Gurub. In the area, there was a boss called ""Hakkar the Soul Flayer"" (warning: this article may contain words used primarily by dorks), a massive winged serpent that had a power that hadn't been introduced to the world yet: ""Corrupted Blood"".  Advertisement Advertisement  The idea was that Hakkar would infect players with the debuff, dealing 875-1,125 points of damage plus 200 damage per second to the target and all nearby enemies for 10 seconds. The unique part of this disease was that it would spread to other players in the vicinity of the infected player, all of whom would then lose health.  It was supposed to be annoying to players during this one battle, but ultimately stay in this specific area while you fought the boss. However, the creators hadn't quite thought things through.  Hakkar was able to transmit the virus to players' pets. Unfortunately, this meant that when you dismissed your pet when they were infected, unknown to patient zero, they remained infected until they were summoned again somewhere outside of the boss area.  Patient zero summoned their pet in a city elsewhere in World of Warcraft, and the plague spread like... well, a plague. Adding to the problem was that non-playable characters (NPCs) that give out quests to the players could contract the disease and spread it to others, without taking damage or dying, essentially acting like asymptomatic spreaders.  Advertisement Advertisement  The resulting pandemic became what the players (and epidemiologists) now refer to as the Hakkar Blood Plague or the Corrupted Blood incident.  What's cool about the incident, especially for epidemiologists, is how well it modeled actual viruses and outbreaks in the real world, as has been pointed out in a thread on Twitter, as well as in a 2007 paper published in The Lancet.  ⓘ IFLScience is not responsible for content shared from external sites.  Advertisement Advertisement  It killed low-level players quickly, simulating the vulnerable such as the elderly or the immunocompromised. You have players who can teleport from city to city, simulating traveling by air in the real world. Stronger players could withstand the disease, barely being weakened by it, simulating those who get mildly ill from a disease.  ""Also aiding in the continuation of the epidemic, a cycle involving the resurrection of weaker characters by those with healing abilities, saw the susceptible population continually replenished (only to be reinfected and die again),"" the team added in their paper.  Then you have the added bonus that people would behave in ways similar to how they would act in the real world.  In an attempt to control the outbreak, the game's makers tried to instigate a quarantine, asking the infected to isolate themselves from uninfected areas. As with real life, many players were compliant but others resisted the quarantine. Due to the highly contagious nature of the disease, the outbreak soon spread through the cities.  Advertisement Advertisement  As well as people who would spread the disease around cities (on purpose or by accident), you also had many people who would attempt to heal the sick and the dying, acting like first responders and medics in the real world. According to the Lancet paper, unfortunately, this may have extended the Corrupted Blood outbreak ""by keeping infected individuals alive long enough for them to continue spreading the disease, and by becoming infected themselves and being highly contagious when they rushed to another area"" though overall they may have reduced mortality rates.  Ultimately, attempting to deal with the outbreak through in-world measures failed due to players not taking the risks seriously, and heading to areas where there were infections, spreading it themselves to others. It had to be fixed by rolling out another update.  Though slightly silly and ultimately of no consequence, it was a good model to see if an extremely highly-contagious disease could be contained through public health actions. Many of the players' commitment to the game was so strong that it gave researchers a pretty good model for how people would act in a real outbreak.  ""All together, these seemingly innocuous aspects of the game world, each directly mirroring an aspect of real-world epidemiology, allowed what should have been a very minor point of interest in a small area of the game, catering to a very specific subset of the players, to become the first online instance of uncontrolled plague to affect millions of Americans, Asians, and Europeans at home,"" authors of the 2005 study wrote in their paper.  Advertisement Advertisement  It gave some good lessons for how people might deal with an outbreak in the real world, and the authors made suggestions for how further games could be used to model more realistic diseases that might cause a pandemic.  Then, unfortunately, we all learned the hard way.  The study was published in The Lancet. An earlier version of this article was first published in January 2021.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlmbHNjaWVuY2UuY29tL3RoZS1jb3JydXB0ZWQtYmxvb2QtaW5jaWRlbnQtaG93LWEtdmlkZW9nYW1lLWFjY2lkZW50LWVlcmlseS1wcmVkaWN0ZWQtdGhlLWNvdmlkLTE5LXBhbmRlbWljLTY5MDQz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"accident","2006-02-10","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T10:20:39","Lexie Bader was 15 years old when she suffered a life-changing snowboarding accident. She was traveling approximately 20 mph and hit a tree. She broke her ankle, but it never quite healed correctly. Over the next nine years, she would have around 30 surgeries performed on it.  Lexie was diagnosed with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) as if the previous nine years weren’t hard enough. CRPS is a form of chronic pain that usually affects an arm or a leg. It typically develops after an injury, surgery, stroke, or heart attack. The pain is out of proportion to the severity of the initial injury and caused by an injury to or difference in the peripheral and central nervous systems. For Lexie, there was no cure.  CRPS is considered the most painful chronic pain syndrome known. It is nicknamed the “suicide disease” because of the prevalence of people committing suicide due to the pain. For this reason, Lexie decided she wanted to amputate her leg rather than live with the pain.  Unfortunately for Lexie, the nerve disease spread to the other side of her body after her surgery and began to affect her other leg. CRPS occasionally spreads from its source to elsewhere in the body, such as the opposite limb.  She was devastated, as the pain was back, so she also decided to amputate her other leg.  Now she is equipped with two prosthetic legs, with various feet and blades that screw into the bottom of the sockets. She and her boyfriend make their own blades for the sockets so she can stay active doing the things she loves, like running, skiing, snowboarding, ice climbing, and rock climbing.  Most importantly, Lexis is back on the snow. She is now 26 years old, and this last season was the first time she got back on the slopes since her amputations. She was up on the mountain almost every weekend, and she had no discomfort.  It is a testament to her for making the tough decisions that ultimately led her back to doing the things she loves. She has a lot of life left to live, and now she can live it to the fullest.

The brother-in-law, , was handling a firearm when it was discharged, killing the 15-year-old. Noakes was arrested on murder charges.  According to Oroville Police Department Sergeant Joel Malinowski, investigators are still conducting interviews in an effort to gather more details about the circumstances that led up to the shooting.    Jinay says Noakes would never intentionally harm her brother.  RELATED |  ""My brother-in-law would never think, in his life, ever think about harming my brother. He loved him just as much as we do,"" Jinay said. ""[Noakes] is a very good guy and everyone that hung around my brother would know that. He was always hanging out with Big Chris...He was so funny. He lost his sense of humor after this...This hurts him more than it hurts us.""  The Lindke family is currently raising money to help cover funeral costs. Jinay remembers her brother as a fun-loving teenager and says they'd bicker just like any other siblings.  ""He had the biggest smile that made everyone else smile. He was very goofy and weird,"" she said. ""Every single time we'd get into a fight, usually I'm not saying sorry first cuz I'm stubborn but I'd go into his room and we’d snuggle and we’d say our sorrys and talk about it.""  Speaking to KRCR Monday, Jinay was critical of Butte County law enforcement and the way they handle minors, noting her brother has made mistakes and has had run-ins with law enforcement, without going into detail.  ""If the law would put more of an effort toward these kids and took more of a legal action towards them...if my brother would have gotten more discipline then he would've probably done better,""Jinay said.  She says she was shocked that her brother even had a firearm in his possession.

"accident","2023-10-06","15:00:00","{""Urbana"", ""Illinois"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T17:02:11","David Brandt, known for having been the subject of the viral “Honest Work” internet meme, is confirmed to have died in an automobile crash. He was 76-years-old.  Brandt was hospitalized over the weekend after being involved in an automobile accident in Urbana, Illinois and later died due to the result of suffering several serious injuries. Of course, for those familiar with Brandt and the memes surrounding him, then they know that he left behind quite the legacy.  The aforementioned “Honest Work” meme first began circulating in 2012. “It ain’t much,” the meme often reads, “but it’s honest work.” The image, and its accompanying statement, originated at a Natural Resources Conservation Service event on Brandt’s own farm in Carroll, Ohio.  Naturally, David Brandt was rather fond of the meme and the impact it had on his work. In fact, he continued to use use the meme as a symbol for the work he and his family performed with their farm. The farm, which has consistently belonged to his family, is said to consist of 736 acres of no-till row crops and cover crops. As of this writing, the farm involves three different generations of his family.  Furthermore, Brandt’s work extended far past memes and his own farm. He often traveled the country to perform in different seminars and reports where he discussed agriculture and his family’s business. As such, the meme is just the tip of the iceberg for what he’s accomplished over his lifetime. It certainly goes to show what honest work can do.  His company Walnut Creek Seeds was owned and operated by Brandt alongside his son, daughter-in-law, and grandson. As such, his legacy will continue to live on and it’s quite impressive to see what kind of career he’s led. Perhaps saying it “ain’t much” is an understatement.  David Brandt’s obituary can be read below:  Ohio agriculture has never before known a global cultural phenomenon quite like David Brandt, of Fairfield County, who passed away at the age of 76 from complications resulting from an automobile accident.  He was known around the world as the face of a meme associated with honest work. In agricultural circles, Brandt will be remembered as a global leader in no-till, cover crops, soil health, nutrient dense crops, and direct marketing. Agriculturalists from around the world visited his Fairfield County farm each year to see his soils first-hand and learn from his many years of experience. He also traveled the world speaking about his farm. Brandt was a Vietnam veteran who returned home to farm in the late 1960s, but soon after his return, Brandt’s father died in a farming accident. He and his wife, Kendra (who passed away in 2020), were forced to sell the farm and start over with very little equipment. No-till was a way to reduce costs. Since then, Brandt’s use of no-till and cover crops has increased soil organic matter and decreased input costs dramatically. He has served as a conservation mentor to many. He farmed and operated Walnut Creek Seeds, with his son, daughter-in-law and grandson.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjcmVlbmdlZWsubmV0LzIwMjMvMDUvMjIvZGF2aWQtYnJhbmR0LWhvbmVzdC13b3JrLW1lbWUtZGVhZC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"accident","2020-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Augusta"", ""Georgia"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T06:24:23","Car accidents aren’t uncommon in Augusta, Georgia. Georgia’s Department of Transportation Crash Data Portal estimates that the number of car accidents in Augusta between 2019 and 2020 was 18,029.  If you have sustained injuries in a car accident and suffered losses, feel free to consult an Augusta car accident lawyer for advice on whether or not you are entitled to a claim and what steps you should take.  Should you pursue a personal injury claim? Here are critical determinant factors to always remember and how to proceed with the claim.  Time Limit for Making a Claim  When you make your insurance claim or file, a lawsuit plays a significant part in determining the validity of your claim. Many car accidents involve claiming an insurance company, which may be to the defendant’s insurer or your own.  In many states, insurance companies require accident victims to file claims within a “reasonable” time. Some insurers have a strict time frame within which you must file a claim. To avoid invalidating your claim, act quickly and don’t wait too long to file your claim with the insurance company.  On the other hand, it is pertinent that you know the personal injury statutory limitations in your jurisdiction if you are filing a car accident lawsuit. Filing outside of the statute of limitations will have dire consequences, as the court will consider your claim time-barred. In many states, the statute of limitations for personal injury claims is 1-2 years.  Elements of Negligence  For a favorable outcome in your claim, you must satisfy all the elements of negligence. You must demonstrate that the defendant owed you a duty of care and breached the duty of care. Also, you must prove that the defendant’s negligence led to your injuries. Without satisfying all these elements, you will likely not receive compensation.  It’s common for the at-fault party in a car accident to raise the defense of contributory or comparative negligence. If the defendant shows that you didn’t act reasonably and suffered injuries, they may hold you partially liable.  You would not receive any damages if the accident happened in a state that upholds contributory negligence laws. However, if the accident occurred in a state that supports comparative negligence laws, how much you receive as compensation will depend on your share of liability.  Sufficient Evidence  The strength of your personal injury claim hinges mainly on the evidence you can present to the court to prove negligence. A lack of sufficient evidence is just cause for the court to dismiss your claim.  To improve your chances of getting compensation, ensure you provide the relevant documentation to support your claim.  The first of these documents is the car accident police report which the insurance company will find helpful when reviewing your claim and conducting their independent investigations.  Secondly, get witness statements. The testimony of people who witnessed the accident will only strengthen your claim.  Lastly, gather all the medical reports to confirm your injuries, which will also contain information on your history. Additionally, keep the receipts for medical tests, medication, and any other charges related to the treatment of your injuries.  The insurance adjuster may try to dispute your injuries, but this may be a big challenge when you have supporting medical reports. For example, if the insurance adjuster claims you have a pre-existing condition, the reports will show your medical history and most recent health status. Depending on the severity of your injuries, your lawyer may use an expert witness to corroborate the details in your medical reports.  Wrapping Up  Having learned that you are entitled to an injury claim and what to expect, you want to have the right people in your corner. So, do some research and hire professionals to help you get the claim.

The accident happened on Friday, May 19, just after 10:30 p.m., on Gerber Road at Waterman Road.  According to CHP, they received a call of a traffic crash and sent officers to investigate. Preliminary investigation indicates that a white Prius was traveling eastbound on Gerber Road between 45 to 50 mph. As the car passed the intersection of Waterman Road on a green light, a pedestrian ran directly in front of the car.  The car struck the pedestrian, identified as Melina Griset Alvarez, and she was thrown approximately 20 inches east before coming to a rest 3 inches off the roadway in an embankment.

The accident happened just after 2:30 p.m. on Monday in the construction zone about a mile west of the Girard Exit (Exit 9). The crash involved a semi, a flatbed pulling a trailer, a van and a car in the eastbound lanes.  According to Erie County Coroner Lyell Cook, the crash may have happened as traffic slowed due to another accident up the road.  The 12-year-old victim was pronounced dead at the scene. Four other people were taken to the hospital including the child’s mother who was flown by helicopter.  All five were in the van which flipped onto its side.  Interstate 90 remains closed eastbound from West Springfield to the Girard Exit causing huge traffic back-up on the highway and on the detour routes.  (WJET/WFXP/YourErie.com) — A rollover accident on I-90 earlier this afternoon has caused serious injuries for those involved.  All lanes are currently shut down on Interstate 90 eastbound Monday afternoon in Erie County due to the accident. That accident happened around 2:30 p.m. between Exit 6 and Exit 8 at mile marker 8.  PennDOT is now reporting I-90 eastbound is closed from Exit 3 (Route 6N – West Springfield/Cherry Hill) to Exit 9 (Route 18 – Girard/Platea). The area was originally closed from Exit 6 to Exit 9 on I-90 and was expanded as of 4:15 p.m.  For those who haven’t been that far west on I-90 in a while, roadwork is being done currently, with the westbound lane’s pavement totally stripped, limiting motorists to one lane both east and westbound with large cement dividers in between.  It is within this change in traffic patterns that the accident occurred. One car is heavily damaged and flipped entirely on its side.  I-90 has been brought to a near standstill at this time. A STAT medevac helicopter was called in to transport for life-threatening injuries.  The Erie County Coroner has confirmed he has been called to the scene of the accident. We reached out to Pennsylvania State Police in Girard for more information, but there has been no update on the condition of those involved at this time.

"accident","2023-04-14","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T13:09:00","The pilot reported that during the preflight inspection, he filled the Piper J-4A’s forward (main) fuel tank to about 1 inch below the top and noted that the auxiliary fuel tank contained 4 gallons of fuel. The pilot used a stick to “dip” the two fuel tanks and validate the amount of fuel in them.  The pilot planned on departing from North Omaha Airport (3NO) in Nebraska for flight operations in the airport’s traffic pattern.  Before the takeoff, the fuel selector was positioned for the forward fuel tank. During the takeoff, the airplane traveled about three-quarters of the way down the runway and climbed to about 300 feet above ground level. The engine sputtered once and stopped producing power. The pilot switched the fuel selector to the auxiliary fuel tank and tried to restart the engine unsuccessfully.  He maneuvered the airplane for a forced landing, but the airplane hit the ground and came to rest next to a tree in a field.  The pilot reported that fuel was pouring into the cockpit after the airplane came to rest, and he quickly got out of the airplane.  The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings and the fuselage, while the pilot sustained minor injuries.  A post-accident examination of the airframe and engine revealed that the fuel tank cap found installed on the filler neck of the forward fuel tank did not appear to be the correct part for the airplane. It had a part number of 2501621 etched on it with no manufacturer name displayed.  The fuel tank cap appeared to be manufactured with a single vent hole. The fuel tank cap was equipped with two worn gaskets stacked under the cap. The lower gasket had multiple visible cracks present on both sides of it. The upper gasket was wrinkled and was displaced toward the vent hole, which blocked the venting capability of the fuel tank. Based on the available evidence, it could not be determined when the vent hole became blocked. No fuel was observed in the forward fuel tank, which had sustained impact damage.  For the Piper J-4 Cub, the sole source of venting for the forward fuel tank is through a vented fuel tank cap. The approved part numbers for the forward fuel tank caps from the original equipment manufacturer (Piper) are A748 (the older style) or 00062-40 (the newer style).  The pilot reported that the forward fuel tank cap was on the airplane when he purchased it several years ago. The pilot and his brother purchased the airplane together in March 2011, and the pilot became the sole owner in October 2017. The pilot did not have any knowledge of the origin or the background of the forward fuel tank cap.  According to the airplane’s maintenance logbook, during the airplane’s most recent annual inspection, the airplane was inspected per Piper Inspection Sheets 230-3000. The accident occurred 39 days after the inspection, and 2.3 airplane flight hours had accumulated since the inspection.  The FAA Airplane Flying Handbook (FAA-H-8083-3B) discusses preflight procedures and states in part:  Checking the fuel tank vent is an important part of a preflight assessment. If outside air is unable to enter the tank as fuel is drawn into the engine, the eventual result is fuel starvation and engine failure. During the preflight assessment, the pilot should look for signs of vent damage and blockage. Some airplanes utilize vented fuel caps, fuel vent tubes, or recessed areas under the wings where vents are located. The pilot should use a flashlight to look at the fuel vent to ensure that it is free from damage and clear of obstructions. If there is a rush of air when the fuel tank cap is cracked, there could be a serious problem with the vent system.  Probable Cause: A total loss of engine power due to a blocked fuel tank cap vent hole, which resulted in fuel starvation. Contributing to the accident was the mechanic’s and the pilot’s inadequate inspections of the fuel tank cap.  NTSB Identification: 103179  To download the final report. Click here.

In a recent interview with the “Valuetainment: PBD” podcast, Mike Tyson made mention of what others have hinted at regarding the cause behind a reported “medical complication” for Jamie Foxx.  When host Patrick Bet-David asked Tyson if he was following “what’s going on with Jamie Foxx,” Tyson replied, “He’s not feeling well.”  Bet-David said, “Something’s going on with him?” and Mike Tyson replied, “Yeah, they said stroke; I have no idea what happened to him.”  Don’t Push Tyson Too Hard  It is unclear if Tyson quickly realized that he might have said too much, but Tyson clarified and attempted to move on from the subject.  The host pressed on and later in the show Tyson became agitated which you do not want to have happen when sitting next to a man once considered “the baddest man on the planet.”  “Hey listen, if we don’t know by now they don’t want us to. You know, man; come on, stop,” Tyson said to create a hard stop on the Jamie Foxx health questions.  For years, the entertainer has worked on producing a movie on his former friend, with the actor playing the titular character. The project has been in the works for more than a decade, and recently gained traction as a potential TV movie. Given his current health, it is unclear if Foxx will remain in the starring role for the project.  What Happens Now With The Tyson Movie?  “Well, it was a possibility,” Tyson continued. “I don’t know what’s going to happen now. But, you know, it’s a strong possibility. Because, you know, Jamie’s closer to my age, so in order to do him, they were going to do what they did with Benjamin Button. They were going to make him look younger.”  However, now the world wants some clarity on Foxx’s health. According to reports, he has been undergoing medical treatment at a physical rehabilitation facility in Chicago, where he has been receiving care for the past few weeks.  What Is Wrong With Jamie Foxx?  What Foxx is being treated for has not been announced to the public. However, the facility specializes in rehabilitation care for patients with physical impairments to the brain and spine.  FOXX Initially was hospitalized in Atlanta in mid-April after experiencing an undisclosed “medical complication,” per his daughter, Corinne Foxx. Since, the family has been tight-lipped regarding his condition.  Foxx’s daughter, with whom he has co-hosted the game show “Beat Shazam,” has shared an “update from the family” on her Instagram story that her father has “been out of the hospital for weeks, recuperating.”  Multiple celebrities have expressed on social media that they’re praying for the actor’s recovery, with no indication of his current condition or confirmation of what he has gone through. The lack of information has led to rumors, and Foxx’s daughter wasn’t having it.  “Sad to see how the media runs wild,” Corinne Foxx wrote at the time. “My dad has been out of the hospital for weeks, recuperating. In fact, he was playing pickleball yesterday! Thanks for everyone’s prayers and support!”  In a since-deleted April 12 Instagram post, Corinne Foxx wrote that her father experienced a “medical complication” the day before, and “quick action and great care” helped guide him toward recovery.  Earlier this month, Jamie Foxx shared a brief message on Instagram to express his gratitude for the support he has received, writing, “Appreciate all the love!!!

Keystone / Jose Sotomayor  read aloud pause  X  A fire that led to the death of 27 miners at a Peruvian mine has prompted questions about the rigor behind a Swiss government-backed effort to improve safety and working conditions in the gold supply chain.  This content was published on May 21, 2023  NZZamSonntag/jdp  Switzerland is one of the most important hubs for gold trading and refining. It’s estimated that around two-thirds of the world’s gold is refined in the country. Much of this gold is mined by artisanal and small-scale miners in Latin America and Africa.  The Swiss government has been working with refiners and various organisations to improve the safety and working conditions of artisanal miners under the banner of the Better Gold Initiative, a public-private partnership supported by the Swiss government.  On May 6, a fire broke out at La Esperanza mine in the Yanaquihia district in Peru, killing 27 gold miners who were unable to escape. The fire was the country's deadliest mining accident since 2000.  The mine had been part of the Swiss Better Gold Initiative, reveals the German-language paper NZZamSonntag. In June 2020, the initiative announced that a partnership with the Yanaquihua mining company and the Swiss refiner Metalor led to the creation of a fully traceable and responsible international supply chain from the Arequipa region in Peru to the Swiss market.  The initiative is now trying to make sense of the tragedy. “The accident is a shock for us,” Thomas Hentschel, Director of the Swiss Better Gold Initiative, told NZZamSonntag. He’s visited the mine before and said, “it's one of the really good mines we have in Peru”.  Christoph Wiedmer, co-director of the NGO Society for Threatened Peoples, says that the accident should prompt reflection on whether there’s enough rigor in the responsible mining standards and verification systems.  “Although the causes have not yet been conclusively clarified, from our point of view the question arises as to whether responsibility has been sufficiently taken adopted across the entire supply chain,” said Wiedmer in a press release. “There are many indications that the previous due diligence measures were insufficient.”  The Better Gold Initiative for Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining was launched in 2013 by the Swiss Better Gold Association with the aim to expand production of responsibly sourced artisanal and small-scale mined gold with a focus on Peru, Colombia and Bolivia. A key aspect is formalisaing miners and securing accreditation as responsible producers. Companies such as refiners and jewelers commit to buy Swiss Better Gold at a premium price. The initiative received CHF18 million in federal funding until 2025.

"accident","2023-04-26","Not Discerned","{""Changsha"", ""Hunan"", ""China""}","2023-05-22T01:29:07","By Jiang Chenglong | China Daily | Updated: 2023-05-22 09:23  Property owner, public officials are at fault in Hunan accident that killed 54  The collapse of a self-constructed building in Hunan province that killed 54 people last year was an ""especially serious production safety liability accident"" caused by the property owner's illegal construction and operation, as well as local governments' irresponsibility and buck-passing, which led to major long-term safety hazards, an investigation said on Sunday.  The results of the investigation into the case were released on Sunday afternoon by an investigation team launched by the State Council, China's Cabinet. Meanwhile, 66 public officials, including four provincial-level officials, were held accountable to varying degrees for the accident.  According to a news release from the investigation team, the accident that occurred in April last year in the Wangcheng district of Hunan's Changsha city left 54 people dead and nine injured, and caused a direct economic loss of 90.78 million yuan ($13.9 million).  The original five-story building, built illegally by the property owner, was built poorly to begin with, with an unreasonable structure, weak stability and low load-bearing capacity, the investigation found. After the illegal construction of three additional floors, the load increased even more dramatically, exceeding the structure's maximum load capacity and ultimately leading to the total collapse of the building, according to the statement.  The investigation concluded that the governments of Hunan province, Changsha city and Wangcheng district, and relevant departments had various problems, including the slow and perfunctory implementation of crackdowns on illegal construction.  In July 2020, a yearlong inspection of illegal construction was launched across the nation, while the governments of Changsha city and Wangcheng district began carrying out inspections half a year later and one year later, respectively — quite near the deadline of the nationwide campaign, the leader of the investigation team said.  ""There was no time[for them] to carry out the inspections, and they reported seriously false data,"" the statement said.  The investigation found that a substantial number of illegally constructed houses were not included in the management and supervision of the housing authorities of Changsha and Wangcheng.  Based on the results, the investigation team concluded that officials from the Hunan, Changsha and Wangcheng governments were responsible for the accident.  The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China and the National Supervisory Commission imposed penalties on four senior officials, namely Hu Henghua, Chen Wenhao, Wu Guiying and Hu Zhongxiong. From 2013 to 2021, they served in key Party and government positions, such as Changsha's mayor and Party chief, in relation to leading the urban construction and inspection work. They were given intra-Party warnings and demerits.  Another 62 public local officials suspected of violating laws and regulations around the accident were held accountable by the Hunan provincial discipline inspection authorities.  Four public officials, including Zhou Zhengmao, former deputy head of the Wangcheng government, had their cases transferred to judicial organs for serious violations of discipline and law and suspected duty crimes.  The other 58 public officials received various punishments. Changsha Mayor Zheng Jianxin, for example, was removed from his position. In addition, 14 people, including Wu Zhiyong, the owner of the building, were investigated by the police and prosecuted by procuratorial organs on accusations of committing major liability accidents, providing false certification documents and picking quarrels and provoking trouble.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZ2xvYmFsLmNoaW5hZGFpbHkuY29tLmNuL2EvMjAyMzA1LzIyL1dTNjQ2YWM0MTZhMzEwYjYwNTRmYWQ0NGJkLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Besut district police chief Supt Abdul Rozak Muhammad said the 38-year-old man was believed to have shot the 32-year-old victim between midnight and 1am.  “Preliminary investigations found that the suspect and the victim, who are good friends, entered the forest with a shotgun, believed to be homemade, to hunt mouse deer.  “On their way home, the suspect claimed to have accidentally pulled the trigger of the firearm that he was carrying, causing the bullet to hit the victim who was behind the suspect,” he said in a statement today.  He said some 50 ball bearings from the shotgun pellet were found lodged inside the victim’s body, including on the neck and arms.  According to Abdul Rozak, the police received a report about a man who had been shot and was receiving treatment at Besut Hospital at about 2am on the day of the incident.  “The victim was then referred to Sultanah Nur Zahirah Hospital for further treatment, and his condition was reported to be stable,” he said.

Mairi Espie needed hospital treatment and has been permanently scarred by the burn while cleaning at the peri-peri chicken chain's branch in Dundee in December 2019.  The corrosive detergent burned through the 21-year-old's jeans, melting the skin on her left thigh, as she decanted it during her shift.  Mairie was rushed to A&E and needed specialist skin treatment, but the burn has still left a three-inch sore, the Daily Record reports.

""It shouldn’t have needed to go as far as a legal action but at the same time I also shouldn’t have been burned in the first place,"" she said following the settlement.  ""This was never about the money for me, just recognition, because at the time it felt like people didn’t believe it was that bad or anything was wrong.  ""But to be fair to Nando’s I think they’ve now done the right thing – they settled the case pretty quickly, the staff have been supportive and the issues that led to me getting hurt seem to have been addressed now so hopefully it means others will be safe too.

He was known around the world as the face of a meme associated with honest work. In agricultural circles, Brandt will be remembered as a global leader in no-till, cover crops, soil health, nutrient dense crops, and direct marketing. Agriculturalists from around the world visited his Fairfield County farm each year to see his soils first-hand and learn from his many years of experience. He also traveled the world speaking about his farm. Brandt was a Vietnam veteran who returned home to farm in the late 1960s, but soon after his return, Brandt’s father died in a farming accident. He and his wife, Kendra (who passed away in 2020), were forced to sell the farm and start over with very little equipment. No-till was a way to reduce costs. Since then, Brandt’s use of no-till and cover crops has increased soil organic matter and decreased input costs dramatically. He has served as a conservation mentor to many. He farmed and operated Walnut Creek Seeds, with his son, daughter-in-law and grandson.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vb2NqLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1L2JyYW5kdC1wYXNzZWQtYXdheS1sZWF2aW5nLWEtbGVnYWN5LW9mLWNvbnNlcnZhdGlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"accident","1991-07-07","Not Discerned","{""SanDiego"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T04:14:00","This love story couldn’t happen today.  Back in 1991 – before dating apps existed, when Portland (as well as the world) was a very different place – a Northeast Portland woman signed up for a Rose Festival program in which locals offered to “host” sailors when the U.S. Navy ships arrived for the annual event.  The woman’s name reminded one sailor of a girl he knew back home in Michigan.  That’s the only reason they met.  She took him out for pizza. They chatted. It was all very casual and innocent.  Things didn’t get serious until they found the dead body.  ***  Carolyn Becker, born and raised in Portland.  Carolyn Becker was born and raised in Portland and graduated from Reynolds High School. Throughout her childhood, she said, the Rose Festival was a very big deal.  “We always went to the parade,” she said. “When I was little, my friends and I had gone to the junior parade and the rides on the waterfront.”  In 1991, she was 28 and coming out of what she called a “bad relationship” when she saw a Rose Festival announcement about a quirky program, started in 1976, called Host-A-Sailor.  A Portland-area resident could volunteer to help a sailor enjoy the city during Fleet Week.  Host-A-Sailor was far tamer than it might sound to today’s Tinder-attuned ears. It usually involved a host taking a sailor to a restaurant, maybe with a side trip to a touristy spot like the Rose Garden or Powell’s City of Books. And that would be it. Sailor and host would say a cheery goodbye and part ways.  Becker figured the program would prompt her to get out of the house and visit downtown, so she called the festival’s office and supplied her information, which included her name and work phone number. She offered to take a sailor out to dinner.  No vetting.  No background checks.  Not even a photo.  Rose Festival officials simply stuck Becker’s slip of paper with her contact info and offer of a meal, along with hundreds of other similar slips of paper, on a board for the sailors to peruse when they walked off the gangplank.  Shortly after Bob Marnon’s ship docked on the Willamette River in the heart of the city, commanders briefed the crew about Rose Festival activities, and mentioned the Host-A-Sailor program.  Marnon checked it out, scanning the names on the large notice board set up in Waterfront Park specifically for this purpose. He stopped when he saw the name Becker, the same last name as a girl he knew in his hometown back in Michigan.  He decided it was fate. He took the slip of paper off the board, walked to a payphone, dropped in some change and called the number on the paper.  A woman answered.  It was not Carolyn Becker. Marnon discovered he was calling the local Social Security Administration office, where Becker worked.  Marnon left a message, but he knew that was pointless. He was at a payphone that did not accept incoming calls. Normal life back before cellphones.  He waited by the phone for a few minutes, weighing his options.  He fished out more change.  Another call.  No answer.  He almost tossed the slip of paper into the garbage and moved on. But something stopped him.  One more time, he decided.  Worst case he was out less than a dollar.  He put more change into the phone, punched in the number.  “I was near my phone,” said Becker. “I heard it ring. He introduced himself. I told him I’d take him out for pizza that night.”  It was a short, straightforward conversation, almost businesslike.  Becker met Marnon at the ship a couple hours later and drove him across the river to a favorite pizza place in Southeast Portland.  “He wanted to pay for the pizza,” she said. “I wouldn’t let him. One of the rules was that volunteers host the sailor. We sat and we talked.”  This was not a blind date.  Just a couple strangers talking.  “I wasn’t looking for anything,” said Becker. “Neither was he.”  But love has a funny way of creeping up on people.  ***  Bob Marnon while he was stationed in San Diego.  It wasn’t a blind date, but they liked each other, had enjoyed spending time together.  When Becker drove Marnon back to his ship, they found themselves agreeing to meet the next night when he got off duty.  They walked around downtown Portland that following evening, talking about their families and life. When the night ended, Marnon asked for Becker’s home address and telephone number. She gave them to him, but she didn’t think anything of it.  “His ship was leaving, and I figured I’d never hear from him again,” she said.  A few days later, Marnon called her from Vancouver, Canada.  He can’t explain exactly why.  A look in her eye?  Her smile?  Her voice?  Why?  “I don’t know,” he said. “I guess I just kind of liked her.”  Marnon can be understated. Yes, he just kind of liked her.  Becker recognized his voice immediately when he called.  “I was surprised,” she said. “Delightfully so.”  Letters and more calls followed.  Marnon used vacation time to come to Portland to celebrate her birthday. They went on a hike to the Cape Lookout State Park near Tillamook.  Then something unusual – and distressing – happened.  “We found a dead body,” Becker said. “That’s when our relationship solidified.”  ***  Marnon recalled it was about dusk. He and Becker were walking on the beach when he saw a man lying on the sand, the waves washing over him.  “I thought someone was passed out,” he said. “I kicked off my shoes and went running because the tide was coming in and starting to wash him out.”  When he got to the body, he knew the man was dead. He pulled the body out of the water and waited for Becker, who’d gone to the ranger station to get help.  When she returned, authorities had been called and took over the matter. She took the moment to ask Marnon why he’d run into the surf. He told her that if that man was his brother, he’d want someone to try to help.  “I thought, Man, this is a good guy,” said Becker. “That’s when I fell in love.”  The next day the couple was in a Tillamook hardware store when they overheard customers talking about the body found by beachcombers. Authorities eventually determined the man drowned after falling off a fishing boat.  The traumatic experience on the beach brought them closer, made them realize something fundamental about each other.  “No one,” said Marnon, “has a dating story like ours.”  After the trip, they kept in touch.  Letters.  Calls.  A bittersweet memory kept coming back to Becker.  The month before she met Marnon, her grandfather died.  “My grandmother was so distraught,” Becker said. “I went to visit her, and she said she wanted to die. She wanted to hold hands with my grandfather one last time and be buried together.”  Her grandmother’s pain was so palpable; it was heartbreaking. But it also gave her hope.  “I knew,” she said, “that was the kind of love I wanted in my life.”  In November, six months after their first meeting, Becker used a week of vacation to visit Marnon in San Diego. They drove up to Los Angeles.  “We went to Disneyland,” she said. The theme park – and everything about the day – was magical.  “When we left Disneyland, we drove straight to Las Vegas and got married in one of those chapels,” she said. “When I flew back to Portland, my parents picked me up at the airport and I told them I was married.”  In January 1992, Becker – now Carolyn Marnon – left Portland and moved in with her husband in a San Diego apartment.  “We had our son in 1993,” she said. “Bob re-enlisted and we were transferred to Treasure Island near San Francisco.”  ***  Marnon, a machinist mate in the Navy, oversaw engines and turbines on the ship. He left the service after nearly a decade, and he and Carolyn moved to Westland, a Detroit suburb, where he uses his Navy skills as a supervisor in a power plant. His wife is a church administrator. Their son is 29. Their daughter, married, is 27.  The nature of love, said Carolyn Marnon, remains mysterious.  “Love,” she said, “comes to you when you’re not looking for it.”  The Host-A-Sailor program ended 20 years ago. Fleet Week continues, but it’s not what it used to be. It was dialed back after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and never recovered.  Carolyn Marnon’s mother died in 2005, her father the following year, the last time she was in Portland.  She has no family left in her hometown, no one there she regularly keeps in touch with.  And yet she subscribes to the Portland Rose Festival newsletter.  “It will always have a special place in my heart,” she said. “That’s where I found the love of my life.”  — Tom Hallman Jr  503-221-8224; thallman@oregonian.com; @thallmanjr  Our journalism needs your support.

Parambir had been arrested on Saturday after being on the run for three days.  On Sunday, Parambir’s counsel also moved an application in court seeking permission for his client to appear in his annual exam scheduled to be held on May 26.  Police said they will now question Parambir to ascertain the details of a woman friend, who was allegedly with him in the red-coloured Beetle car at the time of the accident, as well as also to try to figure the names of all those who had helped him escape from the spot later.  On Sunday, the police told the court that the interrogation of Parambir was required in order to ascertain where he had been hiding for the last three days.  A police officer, on condition of anonymity, said that Parambir’s woman friend has been identified as a shooter and a notice has been served to her to join the investigations. He added that the duo used to practice together at the Chandigarh police shooting range in Sector 25.  Investigators stated that the Parambir was enroute to drop his woman friend from the Sector 25 shooting range to Mullanapur roundabout when the road accident took place at the Dhanas-Sarangpur road on May 17. He was arrested for culpable homicide not amounting to murder and rash driving.  Police have so far established that 19-year-old Parambir is a national level shooter, and a BA first year student in SD College, Sector 32.

A case under charges of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, and rash driving has been registered at Sarangpur police station and Parambir arrested on Saturday  Investigators so far have claimed that it was Parambir who was behind the wheels of the car on Wednesday night.  SSP (UT) Kanwardeep Kaur said, “During the course of investigations, we examined the CCTV footage, and social media accounts of the accused, besides taking technical assistance and cultivating human intelligence to trace accused. At least 15 police teams were formed who conducted raids at multiple places during our search for the accused. He was finally arrested from near Dhanas on Saturday evening.”  Advertisement  A police officer said that the accused, Paramveer, was identified by at least two people, who were present at the spot at the time when the speeding Beetle car hit the seven people on May 17.

The vehicle was driven by Officer David Danielson.  The accident occurred near the intersection of Woodbury Street and North 12th Avenue. Danielson was conducting a routine patrol through the area at the time. The officer immediately summoned medical treatment for the child, who was transported to a medical facility. The Marshalltown Fire Department and the Unity Point Ambulance service responded.  The accident did not appear to result in serious injury. The boy, son of Laura Gonzalez-Saravia, was treated for a wound on his right foot and lower leg, and had various scratches and abrasions. He was treated and released, and will have additional medical follow-up later this week.  Gonzalez-Saravia said her son, Maximiliano Saravia, is doing better, but is complaining of pain. He woke up scared because he could not move his leg. His ankle is broken, but Maximiliano will see a specialist on Monday to determine a treatment plan, and how long recuperation will be.  Marshalltown Police Department Chief Mike Tupper said, upon reviewing the video from the police department vehicle, Danielson was trying to navigate around an ice cream truck, and the boy ran out in front.  “He [Danielson] had no chance to avoid him,” Tupper said. “I want to emphasize that I am not blaming anyone. Accidents happen.”  The chief said other children and adults were in the vicinity when the accident occurred, and added Gonzalez-Saravia was with her son right away.  “It happened fast,” Tupper said. “We are thankful the child is okay. I called the mom last night. We are going to stay in touch with her and make sure they have all the help they need.”  To help avoid similar accidents in the future, Tupper urged parents to talk to their children about safely crossing the street. He said children need to be watched closely, and be with an adult or a responsible older child who can help with crossing.  “Having five kids myself, I know this stuff happens,” Tupper said. “We are just really thankful no one was seriously injured.”  Danielson has been a Marshalltown police officer for 16 years, and works as uniformed patrol. An investigation of the accident is ongoing.  ——  Contact Lana Bradstream at 641-753-6611 ext. 210 or lbradstream@timesrepublican.com.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzcmVwdWJsaWNhbi5jb20vbmV3cy90b2RheXMtbmV3cy8yMDIzLzA1LzQteWVhci1vbGQtaGl0LWJ5LW1wZC12ZWhpY2xlLTIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Besides, a pet dog riding with them was also killed in the mishap.  Investigating officer Sub-Inspector Balraj Singh from the Sadar police (Tarn Taran) said the deceased was identified as Jobanpreet Singh (23), a resident of Tur village, and the injured as Harmanjit Singh of Sangha village. Harmanjit was admitted to a private hospital in Tarn Taran.  The deceased along with his friend was going towards the Goindwal Sahib side when a speeding Scorpio (PB-09 AJ-9363) coming from the opposite side hit them near Jhander village. The impact of the collision was such that the head of Jobanpreet Singh was severed.  A large number of residents living in nearby areas rushed to the spot and started rescue operations. A police team from the Sadar police led by Sub-Inspector Balraj Singh reached the spot.

"accident","2023-05-21","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T20:23:12","Lifelong learning is a choice.  “My best advice for those in this field: Pay attention, experiment, and be prepared for things to KEEP changing,” explains Cammy Bean in a Crystal Balling With Learnnovators interview. “AI is getting built into all the tools we already use and our workflows will continue to evolve. So don’t resist it—resistance is futile, after all.”  Bean is well known within the L&D community for her books The Accidental Instructional Designer, 1st and 2nd editions. She’s also the author of several TD magazine articles and is a digital learning professional and senior solutions consultant at Kineo.  Like other individuals, L&D professionals can get too focused on the bells and whistles and cool capabilities of technology. Bean cautions, “Someone getting into ID who is starting as a course builder using a tool like Storyline may make the mistake of trying to build courses that have all the functionality and all the animation and all the clicking. Don’t over-architect the learner experiences you design.”  She adds: “Just because a tool has an interactive type or cool feature doesn’t mean you should make use of it. I call it ‘avoiding the trap of clicky-clicky bling-bling.’ Instead, focus on designing a learning experience that supports the learner to be able to do what you need on the job and avoid all the ‘jazz hands’ distractions that can actually depress learning outcomes.”  Advertisement  Bean is helping guide attendees at ATD23 and facilitated two sessions on Sunday, May 21. During “Best Practices for the Accidental Instructional Designer,” she shared core tips on how attendees can quickly improve their skills in writing better experiences and designing more effective digital learning interactions.  Also on Sunday, Bean was in the ATD Career Center leading “Charting Your Career Path in L&D: From Instructional Designer to Where?” Many of those in L&D joined the profession quite by accident. Is there something else in the future for you, a somewhat divergent road within the field you’d like to explore?  Advertisement  Bean’s session discussed the Talent Development Capability Model to inspire attendees to think about how they may grow and where their skills may shine, and she spoke about her theory, the four pieces of the “learning pie.”  “For those of you getting into the training and instructional design field, think about the big picture that makes up this field. I talk about it in terms of gaining proficiency in the four pieces of pie that make up our practice: learning, creativity, technology, and business. Within each of these pieces of pie, there’s a lot to drill down into.”  A well-rounded practitioner typically develops a deep “sweet spot” where they focus their skill development, states Bean. “When I got started, my focus was on writing and experience design (creative), and I started understanding learning objectives and Bloom’s taxonomy (learning). We were a high-end custom shop, and [although] I left the technology pieces to others, I did have to take on project management and client communication (business).”  Bean suggests that L&D practitioners know their own strengths within the learning pie. “In the 27 years I’ve been in the industry,” she shares, “I’ve grown into all of these pieces a little bit at a time, and I continue to find new areas to learn more about. Lately, I’ve been reading and learning about data and analytics, which is definitely not my sweet spot and not something I would have thought I’d ever be all that interested in. Don’t feel you have to take it all on all at once. You’ve got time—especially if you stick around in this field. The opportunities for growth and development are practically endless.”  ","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRkLm9yZy9hdGQyM25ld3MvaXRzLW5vLWFjY2lkZW500gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

She helped get him out and then worked to get her husband Jeremy out of the driver’s seat. All while the engine was now on fire and the flames started spreading.  “I said come on baby you gotta get out of this truck, it’s on fire and first thing he says ‘I’m gone’, he says ‘I’m gone’, he thought he was dead. I said you’re ok, you gotta get out of this truck,” said Crews.  Video from another driver shows the intensity of the flames and you can hear things popping and exploding.  EMS arrived and there were others who stopped to help. Crews said her husband and his brother have several broken ribs and bones but they’re alive.  St. Louis City Police are investigating the crash and have not released details on why the first car stopped on the interstate. The driver in that vehicle died on the scene. The crash happened at 4:20am and resulted in lanes shutdown on Sunday morning.  Copyright 2023 KMOV.

A single workplace accident can leave a big impact on your business. Between the medical bills, the lost productivity, all the workers’ compensation paperwork, and the low morale, the costs are high. Taking measures to ensure that your workplace is safe, cost effective and will improve employee morale, while also boosting productivity and having a positive impact on your bottom line.  Unfortunately, workplace injuries are all too common. While some workplace injuries will inevitably fall outside your realm of control, you can take certain steps to prevent unexpected incidents at your business. Use these workplace injury prevention tips to improve employee safety at your business.  Workplace safety tips to help in accident prevention is the best way to avoid these costs. Safety guidelines on how to prevent workplace accidents and protect the workforce.  Incorporate a safety and wellness plan  The foundation for a safe work environment is an effective accident prevention and wellness program. Implementing a formal workplace injury prevention program is key to identifying such risks.  Conduct pre placement physicals  Verifying that your potential employees have the professional experience and physical acumen to safely perform all of the duties required for the job can go a long way toward keeping workers safe. Some accidents are caused by inexperience and the inability to physically perform the position.  Educate employees and management staff frequently and effectively  Continually cultivate a safety standard among employees and management staff. Train employees about the importance of following safety measures as often as possible. Many occupational injuries and illnesses can be prevented through an established communication system.  Research safety vulnerabilities  Pay attention to common accidents and develop strategies to keep these setbacks from happening.  Provide protection equipment  PPE is necessary and should be enforced at hiring, meetings, and with impromptu monitoring. Take time to teach employees how to properly use goggles, face protection, gloves, hard hats, safety shoes, and earplugs or ear muffs. Also encourage the employees to attend industry safety workshops and classes.  Have adequate staffing levels  Most of the time, overtime hours are implemented because of low staffing levels. Overworked employees may suffer from exhaustion and cut corners to meet or exceed output. Hiring part-time or seasonal staff could help prevent accidents due to exhaustion.  Inspect and maintain all company vehicles  According to The Occupational Safety and Health Act findings, workplace driving accidents cost employers an average of $60 billion dollars a year. Maintenance should include monthly inspections and repairing vehicles as soon as possible.  Monitor safety measures  After initial training, reinforce safety measures at every opportunity, i.e. staff meetings, supervision, and education. Reward employees who abide by setting standards or staying injury free for a specified amount of time.  Keep an orderly workplace  Poor housekeeping can cause serious health and safety hazards. The layout of the workplace should have adequate footpath markings, be free of debris, and a stations for cleaning up spills. Make sure all instructions are clear and organized to prevent undue mishaps in the workplace.  Be prepared with workers’ compensation  Unfortunately, no matter how much you invest in health, safety, and training, accidents still happen, and a worker can still get injured on the job. When an accident occurs, be sure that you’re prepared by having adequate workers’ compensation coverage. If one of your employees becomes injured or sick while on the job, workers’ compensation insurance can pay for their medical expenses and rehabilitation costs.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhyZGlnZXN0LmNvbS93aHktd29ya3BsYWNlLWFjY2lkZW50LXByZXZlbnRpb24tc3RyYXRlZ2llcy1hcmUtb2YtdXRtb3N0LWltcG9ydGFuY2Uv0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlaHJkaWdlc3QuY29tL3doeS13b3JrcGxhY2UtYWNjaWRlbnQtcHJldmVudGlvbi1zdHJhdGVnaWVzLWFyZS1vZi11dG1vc3QtaW1wb3J0YW5jZS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Wyatt Fleming was five-years-old when he got into a lawnmower accident at his home and lost his leg. The month of May marks this anniversary, but instead, his family is turning tragedy into triumph.  Now, 7 years old, Fleming is everything you’d expect a little boy to be: Happy. active, curious and full of energy.  When asked what he liked to do for fun, his response was like any other kid his age.  “I like to ride my bike,” he said.  A near-tragedy  Two years ago this month. it almost didn’t seem possible. Wyatt was playing in the yard and had a run-in with a lawnmower his grandmother was operating.  “She was cutting grass and for those big lawn mowers, when you get to the corner you hit a spot where you need to turn around, you sort of have to back them up a little bit to turn them around. And although my children know better, you know, telling them that you know you have to stay away from a lawnmower, especially when it's running. My son has ADHD and it was one of those moments where he was just, you know, 'I want to see grandma,'” said Megan Standish-Fleming, Wyatt's mother.  She said he ran out to go see his grandmother and ran up behind her at the exact moment as she was trying to turn the lawn mower around.  “It was one of those freak accidents,” she said.  When her husband called 911, the ambulance available for dispatch was coming from northern Wake County, taking about 20 minutes.  “Fairview Fire heard the call and said you know this, this does not sound good. I think we might need to roll out to that. And they showed up at our house within five minutes. Five minutes. If they had not shown up, Wyatt would have died,” Standish-Fleming said.  He had an immediate traumatic amputation of his left leg.  Standish-Fleming said firefighters with the Fairview Fire Department had the proper training to help get the blood under control.  “They got him under control and got some IVs going and everything. They saved my son's life. Incredible. Literally saved my son's life and they weren't even supposed to be there.” she explained.  A moment two years in the making  Ever since that day, the family has wanted to find ways like this to thank those who have helped then and now.  “I'm just happy to get out here to see other people just like me,” Wyatt said at the North Carolina Adapted Sports' first Bike Rodeo, Helmet Safety Check, and Touch-A-Truck fundraiser.  NC Adapted Sports showed Wyatt what is possible for him. Over the past two years, they have helped him stay active and provided his parents with the right resources to navigate his new normal.  Dozens of people came out to the Middle Creek Community Center for the fundraiser who also had a big role in helping him.  “He stopped saying I can't do anything. I can't do anything and started saying I can do stuff. I can ride a bike. I can do this,” Standish-Fleming said.  They’re now using this time as an opportunity to help others learn more about resources out there for kids like Wyatt. In turn, it’s helping them heal.  “You can do the things you want to do. You know it might be rough today but you can overcome,"" Standish-Fleming said.

On Sunday in Kansas City, Missouri, Murray found himself hoisting a trophy for the first time in seven years after winning the 2023 AdventHealth Championship on the Korn Ferry Tour. He did so despite a double-bogey 7 on the 18 hole.  Murray put himself in great position after a 64 on Saturday. He opened that round with three straight birdies, had another at 12 and then put his foot on the gas, closing with birdies on Nos. 15 through 18.  On Sunday, Murray birdied Nos. 1, 7 and 10 before an eagle on No. 13. He had another birdie on 16 before parring the 17th. With just one bogey through 71 holes, Murray stumbled a bit on the par-5 closing hole with a double but shot a 68 to get to 19 under and hold off Rico Hoey and Wilson Furr by a shot.  The win was Murray’s second on the Korn Ferry Tour. He also won as a rookie on the PGA Tour at the 2016 Barbasol Championship.  Murray made news off the course for getting into Twitter spats with other pros, particularly Kevin Na. Murray’s scooter accident in Bermuda didn’t lead to any broken bones but he needed 50 stitches — 25 stitches on his face, 10 on his leg and others on various parts of his body.

Jeremy Renner Shared His Physical Recovery Update  On Thursday, Jeremy Renner made an Instagram post to update fans about his physical recovery. The “Avengers” actor shared a video of him exercising his legs on an anti-gravity treadmill. He captioned the post, “First attempt at a very light jog with weight-assisted lift for the broken tibia.”  In his update, Renner also shared his short motivation during recovery, writing, “Pain is progress for me.” He said jogging was “a new exercise” and required “movement I’m not used to.” As he jogged and started breathing heavier, Renner added, “Walking and jogging [use] very different muscle groups.”  He’s Shared Clips Of Himself Exercising  Renner has recently shared several clips of his physical recovery progress with fans. The videos showed the 52-year-old actor doing different exercises to regain full mobility in his legs after shattering his tibia.

However, it is easily done and could happen to you.  2 Check your gate before boarding - or you might end up in the wrong country Credit: Alamy  Last November, a woman from the US was meant to fly with Frontier from Pennsylvania to Florida, only to end up in Jamaica when the gate changed after visiting the bathroom.  A Brit almost flew home from Turkey to Gatwick rather than Birmingham after boarding the wrong easyJet plane.  And a grandma ended up in Poland rather than Slovenia after a boarding blunder with Wizz Air.  While it may seem obvious when boarding a flight, the issue is becoming more frequent due to the higher volume of flights taking off.  Passengers are able to get through security with their passport and boarding pass, but it is up to them to find the correct gate.  Crew will also usually check passports both at the gate and while boarding - but this can sometimes be bypassed, resulting in being on the wrong flight.  If it is a full flight, your error is more likely to be caught before take off - but if the plane is half empty, you might take off before you realise the mistake.  Some airlines take liability - both Wizz Air and Frontier apologised to their passport and offered compensation when it happened.  However, airlines such as Ryanair say the onus is on the passenger to find the correct plane.  A spokesperson previously said: ""It is each passenger's responsibility to ensure they board the correct aircraft.""  It isn't always that simple - as some airlines have multiple flights to the same destination in one day.  One couple from Manchester only realised they were on the wrong flight to Alicante because their seats were taken - as there were two flights leaving at a similar time.  To avoid it happening to you, here are some ways you can make sure you end up at the correct destination.  Double-check your gate flight number before boarding the plane  Ask crew at the desk for the destination you are heading to  Check with flight attendants while boarding  Flag with crew if someone claims to be in your seat  Here are some other big airport mistakes you could be making.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL3RyYXZlbC84MTY2NTI5L3dyb25nLWZsaWdodC1ib2FyZGluZy1taXN0YWtlLWV4cGxhaW5lZC_SAVNodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGUtc3VuLmNvbS90cmF2ZWwvODE2NjUyOS93cm9uZy1mbGlnaHQtYm9hcmRpbmctbWlzdGFrZS1leHBsYWluZWQvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Staring at a series sweep, the Lakers will need to pull off a miracle to make the NBA Finals now. While the night turned out to be disappointing for the Purple and Gold, there was one moment in the game that united the entire NBA fanbase, albeit an unfortunate one. LeBron James‘ mid-game collision with a famous 56-year-old brought out the cruel side of fans.  With yet another close battle in Game 3, physical plays were indeed expected. But definitely not with a 56-year-old official. Though the Lakers are trailing 0-3 in the series, that did not stop their fans from enjoying James’ collision.  LeBron James’ unintended contact leads to bleeding  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad  The Lakers are in big trouble! Initially trailing down 2-0, the Lakers had a perfect chance to even the series with two home games. Anyhow, Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray did not let LeBron James and the Lakers gain momentum. After tonight’s loss, the 4-time MVP’s hopes of his 5th ring might get dashed soon. Amid all these concerns, however, Lakers fans had fun mocking famous official, Scott Foster after The King collided with him mid-game.  Foster is one of the most controversial referees in the NBA. His impact on the games has often been a huge deciding factor. Moreover, Foster’s infamous incidents with Chris Paul are well-known around the hoops community. 38-year-old Paul had a 13-game losing streak in the playoffs when Foster was one of the officials of the game before finally breaking the curse this year. Was James taking revenge for his good friend?  Watch this story: “As staggering insult on live TV leaves LeBron James unfazed, Lakers’ star shoots daggers at Ja Morant’s Grizzlies”  In the game today, LeBron James bumped into Foster when he rushed for a fast break. Though it was unintentional, Foster was seen bleeding as he received assistance from medical staff. Surprisingly, the 56-year-old did not get any pity from the fans.  Scott Foster gets no sympathy from the NBA world  Well, fans believe Foster has made a lot of game-changing calls. Calls that have not favored their favorite team. Thus, after colliding with James today, fans did not pity him. Rather, they enjoyed it for a while.

The incident occurred at approximately 1:10 p.m. at Wagner Heights Road and Thornton Road in Stockton, officials said.  Details on the Box Truck Versus Pedestrian Accident in Stockton  A preliminary release by Stockton PD revealed that Thornton Road near the intersection of Wagner Heights Road was briefly shut down for officials to investigate and clear the scene. The incident involved a box truck and a pedestrian identified as a teenage girl. Additional information on the box truck versus pedestrian accident in Stockton was unavailable due to an ongoing investigation.  Seeking Financial Compensation in a Pedestrian Accident Injury Case  Car versus pedestrian crashes may result in traumatic injuries requiring ongoing rehabilitation and medical treatment. Common pedestrian injuries include traumatic brain injuries, broken bones, spinal cord injuries, road rash, and more. If driver negligence was the cause of the incident, an injured pedestrian may have grounds for a claim for damages against the at-fault party. These claims are generally filed against the insurer representing the motorist that caused the pedestrian accident. Eligible claimants may be reimbursed for medical bills, pain and suffering, wage loss, and more.  Drivers in California are required to exercise a higher duty of care in locations where there are children present, like community parks, neighborhoods, and school zones. When a motorist fails to uphold this duty and causes a pedestrian accident involving a minor child, they may be liable for the resulting losses. It is essential to retain legal counsel in these situations to protect your rights and best interests. Learn how our legal team at AutoAccident.com can help you and your family through this difficult time by scheduling a free case evaluation. Watch this video to learn more about us and how we can help.  How Much Time Do You Have to File a Personal Injury Case?  There is a limited amount of time to bring a case in California. Eligible claimants generally have up to two years to file a case in court, according to CCP 335.1. This deadline is extended for minor children injured in accidents. After their 18th birthday, they have two years to file a case in civil court. Claimants must do so to protect the statute if the matter is not settled within that time. Failing to do so may lead to the court’s dismissal of the case. Do not let this happen in your case, and retain legal counsel immediately following your accident.

As the bus crossed Perambalur , the driver operated the vehicle recklessly and negligently. Consequently, Sathish was thrown upward, and hit the bus's roof, He then fell onto the iron rod of the seat handle in front of him causing severe injuries to his vertebral column requiring medical treatment. He filed a petition with the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, seeking compensation.After evaluating the oral and documentary evidence, the tribunal concluded that the accident occurred solely due to the bus driver’s reckless driving. The tribunal also acknowledged the claimant’s significant injuries to the vertebral column, which prevented him from performing his daily activities. Taking into account a certificate issued by a government doctor, confirming the his 40% disability, the tribunal directed the transport corporation to pay Sathish a compensation of 6.44 lakh in 2019.Challenging the tribunal’s decision, the transport corporation (appellant) filed civil miscellaneous appeals with the Madurai bench of the Madras high court. The appellant argued against the plausibility of being thrown up to the bus roof and subsequently falling onto the iron rod of the seat handle, deeming the claimant’s account highly implausible.Justice R Vijayakumar examined the medical records, which clearly indicated that Sathish suffered severe injuries, including a compressed fracture in his vertebra. A disability certificate issued by the medical board verified a 40% disability. The tribunal has rightly awarded compensation in this case. There are no grounds to interfere with the award passed by the tribunal, observed the judge, who dismissed the appeal preferred by the transport corporation.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vbS50aW1lc29maW5kaWEuY29tL2NpdHkvbWFkdXJhaS9oYy11cGhvbGRzLTYtNGwtcmVsaWVmLWZvci1hY2NpZGVudC12aWN0aW0vYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvMTAwMzg5ODkxLmNtc9IBcGh0dHBzOi8vbS50aW1lc29maW5kaWEuY29tL2NpdHkvbWFkdXJhaS9oYy11cGhvbGRzLTYtNGwtcmVsaWVmLWZvci1hY2NpZGVudC12aWN0aW0vYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93LzEwMDM4OTg5MS5jbXM?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The accident occurred on Friday, May 19, 2023, at Enyiresi in the Eastern Region on the Accra-Kumasi highway.  The man, identified as Kofi Gyan, was driving a Hyundai Sonata car with registration number GS 7776-19.  The car is reported to have fallen into a river along the highway when he lost control of the steering wheel in an attempt to avoid a head-on collision with a sprinter bus that had made a wrongful overtaking.  This resulted in the death of the three occupants.  Confirming the incident to Myjoyonline.com, an Assistant Divisional Officer (ADO) Alex King Nartey of the Public Relations Department of the Ghana National Fire Service (GNFS), said the bodies of the deceased, one male and two females, were deposited by officers of the GNFS at the Enyiresi Government Hospital.  According to him, the GNFS received a distress call about the incident at 6:10 am on Friday, and arrived at the scene at 6:33am. He said the three bodies and the car were retrieved at 7:03am using the GNFS’ equipment.  According to ADO King Nartey, their preliminary investigations suggest that the car may have crashed on a hard surface since it was severely damaged from the front.  Although the Police Motor Traffic and Transport Department (MTTD) is yet to comment on the accident, ADO King Nartey said he suspects the driver of the sprinter whose reckless overtaking caused the accident fled the scene.  He, therefore, appealed to members of the public who may have been on board the sprinter bus to volunteer information to the police that can lead to the driver’s arrest.  A group of young men from the community had attempted to retrieve the bodies and the car from the river, but were unsuccessful until officers of the Ghana National Fire Service arrived at the scene.

[Right] The 33-year-old victim suffered head injuries as a result of the accident.  She was on her way to get breakfast before heading to work when a van came out of nowhere and changed her life.  Stomp earlier reported that a 50-year-old man was arrested for allegedly driving under the influence of drugs and suspected drug-related offences after the van he was driving hit a woman along Jalan Sultan on Apr 18.  The 33-year-old woman was taken conscious to hospital.  Stomp contributor Candy told Stomp she was the victim of the accident and wanted to share how her life has been impacted by that fateful day.  The single mum of a one-year-old baby said the day started out like any other work day.  At about 7.20am, she was about to enter a 7-Eleven at the Textile Centre to get her breakfast before taking the bus to work  ""Before entering, I felt a sudden sense of unease,"" she said.  ""I looked up and saw a white van driving towards me just 20 metres away.  ""He was so fast and came out of nowhere without any horning or precautions.  ""I tried to dodge but he hit me and I flew onto the pavement.  ""The moment he hit me, my brain went blank and the next thing I knew, I was bleeding from my head with excruciating pain all over my body.  [[nid:517239]]  ""I couldn't stand on my own or move.  ""I was in shock while sitting there bleeding and trying to call for an ambulance.  ""Suddenly, the driver who hit me came out of his van but was incoherent and unable to speak clearly, let alone assist me.""  Candy said two kind cyclists, a man and a woman, crossed the road to come to her aid and helped her to stop the bleeding on her head with their first aid kits.  They also brought her some drinking water.  ""People around started gathering and some even tried to speak with the driver but he couldn't say anything clearly and he started laying down on the pavement,"" Candy said.  ""At this point, the two cyclists and onlookers suspected that he was under the influence.  ""He had knocked down a road sign, busted his van's front tyre and broken the vehicle's front windshield, indicating that he was driving at a pretty fast rate at the time of the incident.""  Candy said when the police and an ambulance came, she was taken to the nearest hospital, Raffles Hospital at about 8.10am and admitted for observation at the accident and emergency department where tests were run and she was examined for injuries.  Aftermath  ""The next day, the accident was reported on the news stating that the Lalamove van driver was driving under the influence of drugs,"" said Candy.  ""A good friend of mine who's also an independent insurance agent contacted me and informed me that for any incident that involved driving under the influence, the insurance company would not cover my third-party damage or hospital bills.  [[nid:628070]]  ""When I received the news at the hospital, I was devastated and feared the high cost of medical bills.  ""I immediately contacted my doctors in charge and asked to be discharged as I couldn't afford to stay longer.  ""The doctors then informed me that apart from bruises all over my body and the lacerations on my head and ears, I had sustained a concussion to my head, two annular tears in my neck and lumbar spine and also a torn ligament on my left knee.  ""I also had a white spot on my right brain which needs further observation to determine its cause.  ""They recommended that I should stay for observation and continue with a follow-up later on, but I conveyed the fact that my financial situation would not allow me to stay warded any longer.""  Candy was discharged on the second day since her accident.  She told Stomp that she has had to undergo three magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, two CT scans and over ten X-rays.  She was advised by her doctor to avoid any prolonged walking, standing, bending of her neck, heavy duties or any kind of sports until further follow-ups and assessments.  [[nid:627923]]  ""My annular tears and injured ligament could take up to two years to heal from my current condition,"" she said.  Prior to the accident, Candy had just started a new job and was in the midst of her three-month probation period, ending on June 7.  ""My new job has been greatly affected as I'm no longer able to fulfil my job scope which involves some manual labour,"" she said.  ""I've been taking unpaid days off as well and have no means right now to get legal help or advice.  ""What happened to me could be the first but definitely not the last and the victim shouldn't be the one suffering the consequences of other's actions.""  This article was first published in Stomp.

The Guardia Civil told The Associated Press that one of its patrols was the first to reach the pilot, who fell outside the exterior fence surrounding the airbase.  According to the Guardia Civil, the pilot suffered injuries to his legs, apparently because he ejected with a parachute from a low altitude. He was evacuated to hospital in a helicopter.  The Guardia Civil said it would collaborate with the military in investigating the crash. It said that the initial information provided by the pilot was that the plane had apparently suffered a malfunction.  The American-made F-18 Hornet has formed a part of the air defenses of the United States since the 1980s and has been purchased by the air forces of several allied countries.  Spain’s air force acquired its first 72 models of F-18 manufactured by McDonnell Douglas in 1983. The fighters, known for their versatility, entered service three years later. Spain's air force later purchased an unspecified number of additional F-18s.  The Zaragoza base is home to a unit of Spain’s F-18s.  Spain’s defense ministry did not immediately respond to questions by the AP about the crash.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipQFodHRwczovL3d3dy53Zm16LmNvbS9uZXdzL2FwL2FwLXRvcC1uZXdzL2YtMTgtZmlnaHRlci1qZXQtYWNjaWRlbnQtYXQtemFyYWdvemEtYWlyYmFzZS1hcy1waWxvdC1lamVjdHMtc3VjY2Vzc2Z1bGx5L2FydGljbGVfMWU1NmU5MWYtYmY0ZS01NDFiLThkNGItNTZkOWZiYWZkZGU4Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The restaurant plans to donate 10 percent of its proceeds to Harper’s family. Share Copy Link Copy  It has been one week since 1-year-old Harper Wren died after being hit by a train in Hardin, Missouri. Her family says it was a heartbreaking accident.Now, the community is working together to honor her memory and support her family. The community has set up a memorial near the tracks where she died with messages of love, stuffed animals, and photos of the almost 2-year-old. ""She had the cutest little cheeks and little rolls. She was just so cute,” her cousin, Sheri Hager, said. “Harper was just a light. She was a light for all of us.""Hager said their family has been overwhelmed with all the support they have received over the past week. “The support has been very much appreciated from everybody, as this has been very tragic for the entire family, for the communities, for the first responders,” she said. That support is widespread. On Saturday, dozens went to a fundraiser at Catfish Charlie’s in Wellington. The restaurant plans to donate 10 percent of its Saturday proceeds to Harper’s family. ""If we can help out in any way possible, we'd be more than happy and that's what we're here for,” Catfish Charlie’s manager Cosette Spencer said. “Seems like people are really wanting to get involved and help out in any way we can.""Hager said the money raised will go toward funeral expenses for Harper and moving expenses for her parents. ""Eventually, they're wanting to relocate away from the train tracks because those were directly in front of their home,” Hager said. “I've never seen such loving, giving, forgiving individuals as those two. It just really kind of gives you some hope.”In the wake of such a tragic accident, her family is asking for grace and kindness. Hager said they have been receiving negative and unkind messages on social media. The Ray County Sheriff posted a video on Facebook addressing some of those messages, asking community members to leave the family alone.""This was a tragic accident,"" Sheriff Scott Childers said. ""For those who are wanting to blame someone, be thankful that you are not in that position. Also remember things can change in a heartbeat, a blink of an eye. Accidents happen. Injuries happen. Kids can walk away.""“Just know that not all details are going to be given. They are very hard to swallow and that information's not for everyone to know,” Hager said. “It was just one of those freak accidents that happened. So, I think the family would just like for everybody to remember, to be kind. And I pray that your family never has to go through something like this.”Hager also said they're hoping to pass Harper's Law. The law would require fences around train tracks in residential areas. She said if it will prevent another tragedy from happening — it's more than worth it.“If we can do anything to make this tragedy a little bit better for others, then that's what our goal is, to try to protect another family from going through this devastation,” Hager said.If you would like to help, there is also a GoFundMe set up to help the family.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rbWJjLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2p1c3QtcHVyZS1saWdodC1jb21tdW5pdHktcmVtZW1iZXJzLTEteWVhci1vbGQtZ2lybC1oaXQtYW5kLWtpbGxlZC1ieS10cmFpbi1pbi1oYXJkaW4tbWlzc291cmkvNDM5NTAwOTbSAYgBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cua21iYy5jb20vYW1wL2FydGljbGUvanVzdC1wdXJlLWxpZ2h0LWNvbW11bml0eS1yZW1lbWJlcnMtMS15ZWFyLW9sZC1naXJsLWhpdC1hbmQta2lsbGVkLWJ5LXRyYWluLWluLWhhcmRpbi1taXNzb3VyaS80Mzk1MDA5Ng?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Royal St. Christopher and Nevis Police Force (RSCNPF) said it is investigating the accident that resulted in the death of 15- year-old Lashley Weekes of Saddlers, St. Kitts.  The incident occurred on Friday around 8:15 pm in the area of Halfway Tree.  Preliminary investigatory reports indicate that motor truck PA-2893, owned and driven by Morgan Wyatt of The Alley, Sandy Point, ran off the island's main road and collided with a house owned by Desmond Morton, located on the seaside of the road.  Wyatt was driving in the direction of Sandy Point with three passengers, Weekes, Tijay Matthew, and ‘Stachie’ of Saddlers.  He overtook two parked vehicles and rapidly swerved back to the seaside lane to avoid oncoming traffic. This resulted in his truck veering off the road and crashing into Morton’s house. Matthew and ‘Stachie’, were in the truck’s bed and fell off upon impact.  Weekes was the passenger inside the truck. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

"accident","2021-08-11","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T04:00:00","THE Oxford Mail on April 30 reported that there had been 135 personal injury claims submitted to Oxfordshire County Council over the last year and one of the leading causes was potholes.  Potholes can be extremely hazardous for people cycling, especially when the pothole is encountered at speed.  However, what makes them even more perilous is the fact that they are often hard to spot.  READ AGAIN: Pubs could be saved by community groups  Puddles, leaves, and debris can obscure them, rendering them invisible to unsuspecting cyclists and exacerbating the dangers they face on the road.  The limited funds allocated for road maintenance in the UK have contributed to the worsening state of repair of our public roads.  Oxfordshire County Council as Highways Authority is responsible for maintaining these roads, but as local budgets continue to be squeezed, insufficient funds are currently available for the vital task of maintenance. Consequently, many potholes remain unrepaired, posing an ongoing risk to cyclists and other road users.  While car drivers may experience a jolt and potential damage to their vehicles, the risks are multiplied for cyclists. Even the most skilled and experienced cyclists can face severe consequences when encountering a pothole at speed.  A slight knock or a bumpy ride caused by riding over a deep pothole can lead to a loss of control, potentially throwing the cyclist off their bike. In some instances, cyclists have swerved into traffic, leading to accidents that result in not only damage to their bikes but also serious injuries or worse, loss of life.  Here’s Cyclox member Sushila Dhall’s account of her encounter with a pothole which illustrates just how dangerous they can be for people on bikes.  “On August 11, 2021 the front wheel of my bike hit a deep pothole where Cowley Road had not been repaired properly. I was indicating to turn left and had one hand on the handlebar.  READ AGAIN: Abingdon welcomes new mayor in annual ceremony  “It seemed I fell in slow motion onto the handlebars, cracking my ribs and unable to take a breath. I fell briefly unconscious as I landed on my hand breaking my wrist, and had a seizure due to brief lack of oxygen. I was in hospital for three days, and off work for several weeks. It took my wrist a year to heal properly, as the bone had to be mended with a metal insert.”  Another of our Cyclox members told us that she cycles less frequently due to the worry about potholes on the roads. This reduction in cycling not only affects individual well-being but also undermines efforts to promote sustainable transportation and combat congestion and air pollution.  What can you do to avoid potholes when out on your bike?  •Never let your mind wander. The term sometimes used is “relaxed concentration” when on your bike.  •Don’t hug the kerb. Good road positioning at least 70cm out from the kerb, will keep you away from sunken drains or steeply cambered road edges and will give you more room to manoeuvre around a pothole.  •Swerving out into the road is dangerous. Scan the road far ahead so that you can change your road position gradually if there’s a hazard.  •Pothole depth can be hidden by rainwater so always go around any puddle if you can.  Since potholes present greater danger to cyclists, it’s important that the council prioritises ones that put cyclists at risk. It’s crucial therefore that you report dangerous potholes. The best way to report is through Oxfordshire County Council’s dedicated FixMyStreet website https://fixmystreet.oxfordshire.gov.uk/ Alternatively you can download an app on your smart phone and report through that. Our experience has been that the county council is pretty responsive if a pothole is posing a danger to people cycling.

Bosses at Little Green Rascals have launched an investigation into the incident and will share the conclusions when it is finished.  Neil told Yorkshire Live that he received a phone call from staff to tell him Delilah had fallen and hurt herself, just before Neil left to collect her. He took a photograph of Delilah, which shows her bloodied and bruised eye. Neil then took her to A&E in York where the 1.5cm gash was closed with glue.  The dad-of-five has submitted a complaint to industry watchdog Ofsted. Neil said his daughter had previously suffered minor injuries while playing, which were reported to him by nursery staff.  Neil admitted his daughter had been 'clumsy' in the past but he was so concerned about the most recent incident he has withdrawn Delilah from the nursery.  The nurseries' accident report said that staff had not seen how Delilah injured her eye, however she told a staff member she hit it on a chair. The staff member found her on the floor with the injury to her eye, the report added.  Neil said the family had been left ""very traumatised"" and Delilah was struggling to sleep, had been crying and was in pain.

Among the compensation components was Rs 3 lakh towards disability, pain and suffering and loss of amenities of life and of life expectancy. ""The evidence on record goes to established that the accident was occurred due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle by its driver and the applicant had sustained injuries and disability in that accident,"" the tribunal said. The amount will have to be paid by the truck owner, ABC Logistics, and The New India Assurance Co Ltd.Kadu submitted the claim before the tribunal on January 25, 2009. He submitted that on November 23, 2018, at about 2.30 pm when the accident took place, he was seriously injured and rushed to the hospital in Panvel. He was later transferred to a bigger hospital in CBD Belapur. Kadu left leg had to be amputated below the knee. He said that he was admitted to the hospital for over a month for which he spent around Rs 10 lakh.The insurer came with defence that the driver of the offending vehicle was not holding a valid and effective driving licence. Thus, according to the insurer there was a breach of the terms and conditions of the policy for which the insurer will have to be exonerated completely.The tribunal, however said the burden of proving this defence was on the insurer.But, the insurer has not examined any witness or placed on record any documentary evidence for proving its defence.

The three individuals got burnt on the spot as a result of the accident whilst forty others sustained varied degrees of injuries.    The injured included the driver of the trailer who had one leg chopped off and had to be rushed to the Holy Family Hospital in Techiman and other nearby hospitals for medical attention.    The accident which occurred around 11:00 pm on Friday, May 19, 2023, at Bono Manso involved a Tamale-Accra bound Kia Grand Bird with registration number AK 285-22 and a trailer loaded with drinks with registration number AS 4766.    According to an eyewitness account, the Kia Grand Bird in an attempt to overtake a vehicle collided head-on with the trailer and burst into flames.    “The Kia Grand Bird was following an STC bus, so when the STC bus did overtaking, it wanted to follow suit but it collided with the trailer and caught fire”, the eyewitness detailed.    Confirming the tragic incident, the Bono East Fire Commander, ACFO Emmanuel Inkoom, revealed that they had a distress call about the accident so they rushed there to deal with the situation.    “Around 11: 40 pm yesterday, we had a call that an accident had occurred at Bono Manso so we quickly rushed to the scene. When we got to the scene, three people had been burnt beyond recognition with several others sustaining serious injuries so they were rushed to the hospital for treatment”.    Meanwhile, the Assembly Member for Manso Electoral Area, Nabila Francis Shaibu, has blamed the accident on authorities’ refusal to construct speed ramps despite several appeals.    “We have been appealing to authorities to construct speed ramps on the stretch to deal with the speeding but they refused and this is the result”.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdoYW5hd2ViLmNvbS9HaGFuYUhvbWVQYWdlL05ld3NBcmNoaXZlL1RocmVlLXBlcnNvbnMtYnVybnQtdG8tZGVhdGgtaW4tYW4tYWNjaWRlbnQtMTc3MDYyMNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"accident","1994-08-15","Not Discerned","{""SaltLakeCity"", ""Utah"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T00:00:02","David Mead claimed his wife, Pamela, had slipped and drowned in their koi fish pond after recovering from bunion surgery. The truth, investigators learned, was far more sinister.  Utah Man Killed Wife In Their Backyard Fish Pond And Claimed She Drowned By Accident  On August 15, 1994, neighbors called 911 to report “screaming and howling” at the house next door in Salt Lake City, Utah.  How to Watch Watch Accident, Suicide, or Murder on Oxygen Saturdays 8/7c and next day on Peacock. Catch up on the Oxygen App.  When first responders arrived, a wildly distraught David Mead said his wife, Pamela, had fallen into their fish pond and drowned. He had dragged her body out of the water.  “The EMT there pronounced her deceased,” Salt Lake City PD Sergeant Mike Roberts told Accident, Suicide or Murder, airing Saturdays at 8/7c on Oxygen.  David was so hysterical he was restrained with handcuffs and put in a patrol car. Meanwhile, investigators processed the scene.  What Happened to Pamela Mead?  Pamela, fully clothed, was lying on her back near the koi pond that was about four feet deep and lined with rocks and bricks.  RELATED: Man Choked His Girlfriend To Death In Scrapyard And Staged The Scene To Look Like She Hanged Herself  “On the back of her head they found that she had a fairly small wound,” said Howard Lemcke, Salt Lake County Deputy DA. “It seemed to be from hitting one of those rocks.”  Neighbors who heard the noise from the Mead residence told investigators that it was pitch dark near the pond. They also said that the Meads appeared to be a happy couple. They had been married about three years and were new homeowners.  Originally from Colorado, Pamela, 29, was a flight attendant who was “very kind, very good-natured,” said her friend Saranya Davis.  Pamela had undergone bunion surgery shortly before died, which made walking difficult. Investigators believed that could have contributed to her fatal trip-and-fall.  An autopsy was performed the next day. The medical examiner observed indicators of drowning as well as the laceration on the back of Pamela’s head. He saw no defensive wounds.  “I ruled the cause of death a drowning and I ruled the manner of death as an accident,” Dr. Todd Grey, former Utah State Chief Medical Examiner, told producers.  But the unusual circumstances of Pamela’s death raised concerns with her family back in Colorado. They shared suspicions about David with Utah detectives. Her family also hired a private investigator, Roger Tinsley, to look into what they considered to be Pamela’s “incomprehensible” death.  Related  Tinsley began by interviewing the Meads’ neighbors. Some believed David’s behavior on the night his wife drowned was “over the top,” as though he was acting. While that raised a red flag, it didn’t prove guilt.  David Mead's Affair, Exposed  Then, on August 18, a woman reached out to police and told them that her friend, Winnetka ""Winnie"" Walls, had been secretly dating David. Winnie agreed to speak with the police.  Walls admitted that “she had been David’s kept woman for some time,” said Lemcki, but she claimed that she didn’t know he was married when their relationship began two years earlier. David timed his liaisons with Walls around Pamela’s work as a stewardess.  Investigators also learned that his aviation maintenance business was in financial trouble. Pamela’s family had secured a loan to bail David’s business out. If he divorced his wife, his relatives could recall the note and he didn’t have the means to repay it, detectives said.  David saw killing Pamela as a solution, Walls said.  Walls told police that David’s plan to murder Pamela involved her having a “nasty fall.” Then he’d collect on a $250,000 life insurance policy he took out a few months before she drowned.  When Walls gave David an ultimatum to leave his wife or lose her, he put his plan in motion, according to detectives.  RELATED: Man With Firearms Training Claimed He Fatally Shot His Wife By Accident While Cleaning Gun  Despite their suspicions about David, investigators didn’t have enough evidence to make an arrest. The fact that Pamela’s death had been ruled an accident was another hurdle.  Grey reviewed the case, and found that the wound on the back of Pamela’s head appeared to have been caused by a blow, not a fall.  He deemed the cause of her death “pending.”  Nine days after Pamela’s death, investigators finally interviewed David. He said he was working on the night of August 15 — and that he had asked Pamela to feed the fish.  David claimed that he returned home that night at 11 p.m. When he couldn’t find Pamela in the house, he went to the backyard, where it was dark because the outside lights weren’t on. He found her in the pond.  He admitted to his affair with Winnie, which he downplayed as “a fling,” according to police. David agreed to take a lie detector test the next day.  Related  In the meantime, detectives dug deeper into the life insurance policy. They learned that David’s brother had asked the company not to discuss the policy with authorities.  Pamela’s family then told police that David had also been involved with a woman named Stormy Simon.  They claimed that Pamela had overheard a phone conversation between David and Stormy. David had allegedly said he didn’t want to divorce Pamela and that “it would just be easier to kill her.”  As a result, Pamela went home to Colorado. But a month later, she returned to Utah to work on her marriage.  RELATED: Was A Campground Dispute Between 2 Deaf Men That Led to Death Self-Defense Or Murder?  More evidence accumulated when detectives learned that the lightbulbs in the outdoor lamps by the pond worked but had been unscrewed.  They also learned that David’s family members had since destroyed the pond. David told Tinsley he had the pond torn down so no one else would get hurt.  At this point the investigation stalled. David passed the polygraph, his work alibi seemed airtight, and Walls recanted about everything she’d told police.  David Mead Is Arrested and Convicted in Pamela Mead's Murder  David Mead, featured in Accident, Suicide, or Murder 417 Photo: Oxygen  Authorities were undaunted. “We just kept working on the case,” said Lemcke.  They caught a break when James Hendrix, David’s cousin, reached out. He told police that David asked him to kill Pamela.  “He gave him parameters,” said Roberts. “It has to be while I’m at work. It has to either look like an accident or a burglary or a robbery. I will give you $30,000 from the $250,000 settlement.”  Hendrix never acted and didn’t take David’s offer seriously. Yet days later Pamela was dead.  Armed with this new information, investigators returned to Grey. He acknowledged that he had made an error and changed the cause of death to homicide, according to “Accident, Suicide or Murder.”  RELATED: L.A. Businessman Claimed Girlfriend Accidentally Drowned — But Evidence Pointed To Murder  Although the D.A. needed more evidence to press criminal charges, Pamela’s family filed a wrong death civil case. The proceedings began in late 1996.  One of David’s coworkers told authorities that he had covered David’s shift the night Pamela died. That destroyed David’s alibi, but the civil case ended in a hung jury.  But the hole in David’s alibi allowed criminal charges to be made on August 15, 1997.  Stormy Simon reached out to the D.A., explaining that she had been afraid to come forward before. She agreed to testify at David’s two-week trial, which began in October 1988.  During it, prosecutors argued that David struck Pamela in the back of the head in their dark backyard and then drowned her in the pond.  David Mead, then 31, was found guilty and sentenced to five years to life. In 2016 his first parole request was denied. According to Accident, Suicide or Murder, his next hearing is in 2037.

The crash occurred on County Route 68 in the Town of White Creek around noon Friday, the sheriff’s office said in a news release. The vehicle, occupied by three 16-year-old and two 15-year-old girls, was traveling west on County Route 68 when it left the roadway and overturned.  One person was airlifted to Albany Medical Center with critical injuries, the sheriff’s office said. Another was taken by ambulance to Albany Medical Center with serious but non-life-threatening injuries, and the others were transported to Southwestern Vermont Medical Center with non-life-threatening injuries.  The sheriff’s office did not release the teens’ names. No update was available Saturday evening on the condition of the crash victims.  County Route 68 was closed while the accident scene was re-constructed. Preliminary investigation indicates speed contributed to the rollover, but no arrests were made at the time. The investigation continues.  The Washington County and Saratoga County sheriff’s offices’ accident reconstruction teams, New York State Police, fire departments from White Creek, Cambridge and Shaftsbury, and Cambridge Valley Rescue Squad and Bennington EMS were involved in the response.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFodHRwczovL3Bvc3RzdGFyLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2FjY2lkZW50LWFuZC1pbmNpZGVudC9maXZlLXRlZW5zLWh1cnQtb25lLWNyaXRpY2FsbHktaW4tcm9sbG92ZXItYWNjaWRlbnQtaW4td2FzaGluZ3Rvbi1jb3VudHkvYXJ0aWNsZV9hY2ExMTBkYS1mNzFjLTExZWQtYTU1MC1hZjdjNzM5YjE1YTUuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The 73-year-old comedian revealed his positive outlook on life with Fox News Digital months after suffering third-degree burns to his face from a gasoline fire at his Burbank garage.  Two months later, Leno was involved in a motorcycle accident in Las Vegas where he broke multiple bones. When asked why he never complains about any of his injuries or the extensive recovery process, his answers were simple.  ""First of all they’re accidents. If they were deliberate, I would be complaining,"" he said before joking, ""Ya, the guy deliberately set me on fire.""  JAY LENO RECALLS MOMENT HIS ‘FACE CAUGHT ON FIRE’ DURING GARAGE BLAZE WHEN HE SUFERED SERIOUS BURNS  Jay Leno has a lot to be grateful for after a few serious accidents landed him in the hospital with broken bones and third-degree burns.  When Fox News Digital caught up with Leno on the red carpet for the ""Hot Wheels: Ultimate Challenge"" premiere, the car connoisseur found a silver lining in the last few difficult months.  READ ON THE FOX NEWS APP  ""Look, I’ve been extremely lucky in my life, you know, and even though the accidents weren’t fun, I was still pretty lucky. I didn’t lose an eye, I’m not horribly disfigured … well, just regular disfigured.  ""I’ve got a lot to be grateful for.""  JAY LENO SHOWS OFF ‘NEW FACE’ AFTER SUFFERING THIRD-DEGREE BURNS  The former late night talk show host suffered ""significant burns to his face and hands"" in addition to scarring on his chest when flames erupted while he was working underneath one of his vehicles on Saturday, Nov. 12.  Leno said in a statement to Fox News Digital shortly after the accident, ""I got some serious burns from a gasoline fire. I am OK. Just need a week or two to get back on my feet.""  Leno had at least two surgeries during his 10-day stay at the Grossman Burn Center in West Hills, one of which was a ""surgical excision and grafting procedure."" He also required the use of a hyperbaric chamber to help provide better blood flow and decrease bacteria.  Jay Leno said good-bye to The Grossman Burn Center Care Team in November after a 10-day stint.  One of those surgeries included doctors creating an entirely new ear for Leno.  Story continues  When asked if it was true he had a new facial feature, Jay was excited to share, ""Oh ya it’s a brand-new ear. When in a fire, ear is just flesh … they kind of made a new one for me.""  Only months after he was released from the hospital, Leno was ""knocked off"" his motorcycle and broke two ribs, his kneecaps and collarbone.  JAY LENO GIVES HEALTH UPDATE AS HE'S SEEN BEHIND THE WHEEL FOR THE FIRST TIME AFTER BEING RELEASE FROM HOSPITAL  He's still somewhat recovering.  Leno showed facial scarring shortly after being discharged from the hospital.  ""First of all, in Hollywood – it’s only how you look, nobody cares how you feel like,"" he joked. ""I mean I still have a broken collar bone, two broken ribs and two cracked knee caps, but I’m getting around.""  Leno recalled the motorcycle incident in January, and said that he went out for a test drive on a 1940 Indian motorcycle. He recognized the smell of a gas leak and maneuvered through a different road.  CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER  ""I turned down a side street and cut through a parking lot, and unbeknownst to me, some guy had a wire strung across the parking lot but with no flag hanging from it,"" Leno told the Las Vegas Review Journal.

Jay Leno returned to the stage shortly after his garage fire accident.  Jay Leno has hundreds of rare and collectible cars in his Burbank garage.  Leno has long been a connoisseur of car culture . He worked as a mechanic while rising through the ranks as a stand-up comedian, and he now owns more than 280 unique vehicles.  The impressive collection of rare, antique and vintage cars is reportedly worth from $50 million to $100 million, but estimates vary due to predictions in what some rare cars could sell for.  On ""Jay Leno's Garage,"" Leno chats with car enthusiasts about favorite makes and models, in addition to showing off his prized collection of cars, motorcycles and all-terrain vehicles.

"accident","2017-07-26","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T03:44:45","MT. HOOD, Ore. — After an unfortunate accident that left him paralyzed neck down, a student at Southern Utah University climbed the tallest peak in Oregon.  When Vishal Shukla was 23, he was in a body surfing accident in California where he broke his neck and was paralyzed in all four limbs. After surgery, he got some devastating news.  “It’s something that a 23-year-old kid never wants to hear. And the exact words were: 'We do not think you’ll walk,'” explained Shukla.  Shukla spent half his life living in Richfield, Utah, and goes to school at SUU. After rigorous training — physically and mentally — he said his recovery is nothing short of a miracle.  “I can use my hands, I can use my arms, I can move around, but my paralysis still affects me to a pretty considerable degree,” said Shukla. “For example, my triceps are still pretty paralyzed — I can’t do a push-up. My grip strength is only a third of what it used to be.”  Fast forward 14 months and Shukla is not just walking, but climbing mountains. This week, he summited Mount Hood — something not many people can accomplish, let alone people once paralyzed in all four limbs.  ""It was definitely a pretty strenuous climb,” recounted Shukla. “But I have absolutely nothing but sheer gratitude for my friends and the crew that we had up there.”  He credits his progress to the teams at Intermountain Health in Murray and physical therapists at Neuroworx in Sandy.  “Thanks to the entire team, the physical therapists, occupational therapists and doctors — everyone did such an amazing job,"" he said.  Shukla also turned his journey into a way to give back to a place that helped him get back on his feet.  “One of the first thoughts I feel like most people have is that you just don’t want anyone else to go through such a similar experience,"" he said.  So he decided to raise funds for families at Neuroworx who might not be able to afford the kind of care they need.  “That money will cover continued rehab sessions that other people’s insurance will unfortunately no longer cover,"" he said.  Donations to Shukla's cause can be made on a GoFundMe page HERE.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxM25vdy5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL3NvdXRoZXJuLXV0YWgtdW5pdmVyc2l0eS1zdHVkZW50LWRlZmllcy1vZGRzLXN1bW1pdGluZy1tdC1ob29kLWFmdGVyLWFjY2lkZW50LWxlZnQtaGltLXBhcmFseXplZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

At 11:06 p.m. Friday, troopers responded to the intersection of state Route 117 and Phillips Road.  They found Braden N. Schick, 43, of Lima, drove a 2020 Chevrolet Silverado southbound on Phillips Road. He entered the intersection and began making a right turn when his vehicle went into the opposite lane of travel.  That’s when a 2007 Volvo semi tractor-trailer driven by Vladimir Zdravkovic, 36, of Winchester, Virginia, which was headed southeast on state Route 117, struck Schick’s truck head-on. The impact pushed Schick’s truck off the norhheast side of the intersection.  The semi-truck and trailer went off the right side of the roadway, down a ditch and into a utility pole. Power lines were knocked down and across the roadway.  Westminster EMS transported Schick to Lima Memorial Health System with serious injuries. He reportedly was not wearing a seat belt, and alcohol was a suspected factor, the OSHP reported.  Zdravkovic did not report an injury.  State Route 117 was closed for several hours as crews worked to remove power lines and vehicles from the scene.  Assisting on the scene were the Allen County Sheriff’s Office, Mid-Ohio Energy, Westminster Fire and EMS, Wayne Township EMS, Minich Truck Repair, Kenny’s Auto Towing and Miller Auto.

(His voice later returned to the film following his rise to fame)  No one stays on top forever. Now, he may be tacking to the Left to reclaim his Hollywood golden days. So far, the public isn’t buying it, but his Hollywood peers just might.  In fact, evidence suggests they already are.  The descent unofficially began with “The Last Action Hero,” the 1993 film that failed to live up to its pre-release hype. The hits began drying up, and by the early 2000s he gave up acting for politics.  He became California’s last Republican governor, but since his dramatic career shift he’s been tacking to the Left when possible.  Arnold Schwarzenegger Returned To Acting Around 2011  Schwarzenegger was never a hard-Right figure, but his GOP bona fides have softened in recent years. And it’s possible it’s a last-ditch attempt at both relevancy and Hollywood gigs.  The star’s official comeback following his gubernatorial period began with a thud. The 2013 actioner “The Last Stand” featured Schwarzenegger in familiar territory, playing a reluctant hero in an action-packed caper. The movie bombed with just $12 million at U.S. theaters.  He kept going, faring slightly better with “Escape Plan” (co-starring former ‘80s peer Sylvester Stallone) which earned $25 million. He subsequently tanked with “Sabotage” ($10 million) and “Maggie,” an indie flop which earned less than $200,000 stateside.  Even two attempts to revive the “Terminator” franchise fell flat at the box office.  What does an aging action star do when his audience deserts him? Kiss up to liberal Hollywood, which overlooks box office grosses if you toe the proper line.  Schwarzenegger played up to the government’s pandemic narratives in recent years, instructing his fellow Americans to listen to Dr. Anthony Fauci. He went so far as to curse out critics with an infamous “screw your freedom” declaration. To his credit, he subsequently apologized, something neither Howard Stern or Jimmy Kimmel have done following their over-the-top pandemic cries.  The star also compared the Jan. 6 riots to the Kristallnacht pogrom during a heated video shared on social media.  “I grew up in Austria. I am very aware of Kristallnacht, or the Night of Broken Glass…It was a night of rampage against the Jews carried out in 1938 by the Nazi equivalent of the Proud Boys. Arnold Schwarzenegger  More recently, the former governor refused to criticize current California leader Gavin Newsom for collegial reasons.  “When you become part of the club, you don’t criticize governors — because you know how tough the job is.” Arnold Schwarzenegger  He still snuck in a jab or two against Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, who he called “too conservative” for his tastes.  “I was against some of the stuff he did with COVID. But who am I to judge? That’s for the people of Florida.” Arnold Schwarzenegger  News flash: Americans are flocking to Florida, in part, because DeSantis followed the actual science and shook off Dr. Fauci’s draconian measures that produced little but harmed many businesses (and lives).  So far, the actor’s liberal charm offensive is working.  Schwarzenegger is the focus of a three-part documentary dubbed, what else, “Arnold,” for Netflix. He’s also starring in the streamer’s “FUBAR,” an action comedy in the vein of his last big hit, “True Lies.”  Will audiences ignore “FUBAR” like they did his recent films? If so, he may have to start talking up AOC or President Joe Biden to stay in the industry’s good graces.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm91dGtpY2suY29tL2Fybm9sZC1zY2h3YXJ6ZW5lZ2dlcnMtc2hpZnQtdG8tdGhlLWxlZnQtbm8tYWNjaWRlbnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

While walking the 2023 ACM red carpet, the “Lights On In The Kitchen” singer told Taste of Country that she’s been focusing on her health and being extra cautious.  Videos by American Songwriter  The platinum-selling performer was forced to postpone a string of shows in 2021 after she was propelled from a horse in Montana. McBryde landed on her head, which knocked her unconscious. The vocalist was rushed to a local emergency room, where she was diagnosed with a concussion and needed a handful of stitches to “close” her scalp.  The following year, her bandmate Wes Dorethy got into a UTV accident. The instrumentalist had to undergo emergency surgery. After a difficult few months, the band has prioritized looking out for one another.  “We’re taking better care of each other and better care of ourselves,” McBryde told the outlet. “Since we started doing those things on purpose—it’s not like we were crappy to each other—we started being more mindful about it, then I became a member of the Grand Ole Opry, and then I won a Grammy, and then we headlined RodeoHouston. All these amazing things, all this hard work that we’ve been putting in all these years, has started paying off.”  As an award-winning group, they stay far away from dangerous activities to prevent any accidents that can hinder their flourishing career.  “I was just like, ‘Wow, that was so bad. It was so bad,'” she recalled. “We have to take better care of ourselves. So, right now no one’s riding as much as a scooter. No ATVs, no skateboards, no horses.”  Although the accident significantly impacted her tour due to terrible vertigo, she revealed that it also affected her songwriting process. McBryde explained that she now has a refreshing and optimistic perspective on life after they were granted another chance.  “Songwriting-wise, it feels sort of like you can walk into the room knowing no matter what we create today, the thing that I wanted to be when I grew up, I am,” she uttered. “So, even if we don’t get a song today, I’m so happy about who we are and the season that we’re walking into.”  The singer-songwriter is back in action. She previously supported Wynonna Judd on her final tour, performed her smash hit “Brenda Put Your Bra On” at the ACM Awards from her critically acclaimed album Lindeville, and is expected to appear alongside Jelly Roll and Tanya Tucker on the road this summer.

The aircraft landed within the perimeter of the base, the defense ministry said on Twitter.  The base, which is about 10 miles (16 kilometers) outside the city, belongs to the Spanish Air and Space Force.  Videos posted on social media showed a plane in flames falling towards the ground.  The air force said several hours after the crash that the pilot was “recovering favorably” but would remain in the hospital under observation for “a few days.”  Spain’s public news agency EFE said the F-18 was training for a flying exhibition when the crash occurred.  The Guardia Civil told The Associated Press that one of its patrols was the first to reach the pilot, who fell outside the exterior fence surrounding the airbase.  According to the Guardia Civil, the pilot suffered injuries to his legs, apparently because he ejected with a parachute from a low altitude. He was evacuated to hospital in a helicopter.  The Guardia Civil said it would collaborate with the military in investigating the crash. It said that the initial information provided by the pilot was that the plane had apparently suffered a malfunction.  The American-made F-18 Hornet has formed a part of the air defenses of the United States since the 1980s and has been purchased by the air forces of several allied countries.  Spain’s air force acquired its first 72 models of F-18 manufactured by McDonnell Douglas in 1983. The fighters, known for their versatility, entered service three years later. Spain's air force later purchased an unspecified number of additional F-18s.  The Zaragoza base is home to a unit of Spain’s F-18s.

Outages began being reported around 11 am in western Emporia affecting customers from Prairie Street to the Lyon County Highway Department north to south and West Ninth Avenue to just past Industrial Road east to west. The outage was restored nearly an hour after it was first reported.  The outage also affected a series of traffic lights in the western corridor. All lights are back up and running. No accidents were reported as a result of the traffic lights being offline.  A broken insulator was determined to be the cause of the outage according to Evergy.  At the same time of the outages, Emporia Fire and EMS were called out twice to Kansas Turnpike mile marker 106 southbound, 21 miles southwest of Emporia, for what turned out to be two injury accidents — with the first being reported around 10:30 am. According to the Kansas Highway Patrol, a 2019 Grand Cherokee driven by 22-year-old Scott Relyea of Friso, Texas hydroplaned on the roadway due to wet conditions, entered a ditch and struck an embankment.  Scott Relyea suffered no apparent injury, however, a passenger, 56-year-old Sheryl Relyea also of Frisco, Texas was taken to Newman Regional Health with suspected minor injuries. Both were wearing their seatbelts at the time of the accident.  Less than 15 minutes later, a second injury crash was reported less than a quarter-mile away on the Turnpike. This wreck also involved a hydroplaned SUV, but the driver and a passenger both declined ambulance transports to hospitals.  11:40 am Friday: Power outages and injury accidents reported in 30 minute span Friday morning as moderate to heavy rainfall continues  A major power outage and at least one injury accident have been reported in and around Emporia as moderate to heavy rainfall continues.

LOUIS, MO – Saint Louis University graduate student Aniketh Vyas says the SLU community treated him like a part of a family, and he is eternally grateful for it.  Vyas lost part of his left leg due to a Jan. 24, 2022, accident on Interstate 64 that sent him, two St. Louis police officers and several others to the hospital with critical injuries.  He walked across the stage at Chaifetz Arena Friday during the School of Science and Engineering precommencement ceremony to receive his master’s in computer science. Vyas completed the degree on time with the rest of his class.  Launch Slideshow Aniketh Vyas celebrates during the School for Science and Engineering pre-commencement ceremony. Photo by Sarah Conroy.  “When the accident happened, the first person to respond was Dr. Pestello,” Vyas said of SLU’s President Fred P. Pestello, Ph.D. “He and some of the global graduate advisors and Eric Armbrecht (associate provost) came immediately, and they took it upon themselves to take care of me.”  On Jan. 24 last year, Vyas was in a ride-share vehicle with other SLU students. The disabled vehicle was pulled off to the side of westbound I-64 with a police presence when another driver came barreling through the crash scene, striking the students and the officers.  “The driver was going 100 miles an hour and lost control of his vehicle,” Vyas said.  Vyas was taken to SSM Health Saint Louis University Hospital, where doctors determined his injuries would require amputation of part of his left leg.  “SLU took on everything while I was in the hospital,” Vyas said. “They took care of everything knowing that I didn’t have parents here, and I drew strength and power from that.”  Vyas said drawing strength from the supporters around him helped him get through the depression that followed the accident.  “I had to reevaluate my life,” he said. “I liked to play games and to run around and travel. I didn’t know right away what my life was going to be without both of my legs.”  The trauma from the accident wasn’t only his – Vyas was on Facetime with his sister telling her that he was okay after the first accident when the vehicle came crashing into the accident scene.  “They have shared this trauma with me,” he said of his family. “They are a part of it, but they are also a part of my healing.”  Healing came through tears and support from the community around him.  “I cried every night for months, but I knew I needed to come out of it,” he said. “SLU went the extra mile with me.”  Vyas said the support from the SLU community was ongoing throughout his recovery. University leaders helped find accommodating housing during his recovery and assisted with his prosthetic. They also worked with the hospital to ensure friends and family could visit.  Vyas said his friends brought him his assignments and would study together in his hospital room so he didn’t fall behind.  “Aniketh demonstrated a remarkable resilience that inspired us all,” said Flavio Esposito, Ph.D., assistant professor of computer science. “I had the privilege of witnessing Aniketh's commitment and dedication to his studies. In the aftermath of the accident, he refused to let circumstances hinder his academic pursuits. His determination is an example for all of us that often find excuses for why we cannot succeed.”  After months of recovery, Vyas faced a setback. An infection sent him back to a hospital room for several weeks.  “He’s been really strong,” said friend and classmate Vamshikrishna Reddy Gantla. “He was almost recovered when that infection came and set him back again.”  Gantla also received his master’s on Friday and is one of the people Vyas credits with helping him get through the past 16 months. He also notes the importance of Kavya Sri Kurada, Devidath Namboori, Sujan Reddy Kandela, Sathwik Reddy and Aashi Pandey in his recovery process.  Vyas said he is looking forward to pursuing a career in computer science, and he credits his time at Saint Louis University for preparing him for the future.  “My mantra is never stop and keep smiling,” he said. “You can adapt and keep going.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNsdS5lZHUvbmV3cy8yMDIzL21heS9jb21wdXRlci1zY2llbmNlLWdyYWR1YXRlLnBocNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The final day of class is My 25.  ""We had some abrasions on the forehead. We had abrasions on knees, arms,"" Asbill said.

Two third-grade classes and their teachers were returning to Bolivar after a field trip to Smallin Civil War Cave in Ozark. A total of 35 were on board.

Berg said the bus driver attempted to avoid hitting the hay bale but was unable to avoid it and then lost control and drove through the median.  The bus crossed the southbound lanes of Missouri 13 and landed in the west ditch. The badly damaged bus did not hit any other vehicles.

Options for Justice and Financial Recovery for Surviving Family Members  When a family loses a loved one because of another party’s poor choices, it may be challenging to cope with grief. Any loss of life due to carelessness or negligence may be considered wrongful death. While the loss may have been accidental, it was preventable had the other side exercised the duty of care they owed the lost close relative. Surviving family members may find themselves in the position to file a wrongful death action against the other side to obtain justice and financial recovery. Such cases may be one of a wide array of situations, including pedestrian accidents.  California law allows surviving family members to seek reimbursement for non-economic and economic damages in a wrongful death action after a fatal incident. These include reasonable costs of funeral services, medical bills before the decedent’s passing (recoverable in a survival action), lost income, mental anguish, loss of companionship, and other associated losses. While no amount of compensation will ever fully alleviate the devastation and pain surviving family members are feeling, holding the other side financially accountable for their negligence may help provide a sense of closure moving forward.  The next step to take after losing a loved one in a fatal accident is to contact an attorney to discuss the case in a free consultation to help you understand your rights and options for recovery. Due to California’s two-year statute of limitations, survivors have a short window of time to seek justice and financial recovery for their losses from a wrongful death case. At AutoAccident.com, we are available anytime to offer free case evaluations. Our California wrongful death attorneys work on contingency, meaning we do not get paid unless you do. For more information about our law firm, watch this video.  Who Can File a Wrongful Death Case in California?  According to CCP 377.60, the spouse, domestic partner, and child or children of the individual whose life was cut short due to wrongful death have priority for filing. If these family members do not exist, a wrongful death action may be brought in benefit of the putative spouse, stepchildren, parents, and other close relatives who depended on the decedent for financial support. To determine your eligibility for filing, we encourage you to schedule a free consultation with one of our skilled and compassionate California wrongful death lawyers at AutoAccident.com today.

Doctors then rushed the young man for a bronchoscopy to remove the object, using a flexible tube and feeding it down the man’s throat.  Eventually, the doctors successfully dislodged the false teeth from his lung airway.  The patient experienced bronchospasm – where muscles in the lung airway tighten – from the operation and was given steroid treatment before being discharged, Jam Press reported.  The 1.5-inch denture was stuck in his lung. Jam Press/Cureus  The row of silver teeth were swallowed by the Wisconsin man after he suffered a seizure. Jam Press/Cureus  Doctors removed the dentures which were causing the muscles in his lung airway tightened. Jam Press/Cureus  Earlier in May, a woman’s denture accident went viral after being posted to TikTok, when the false teeth fell out into her birthday cake as she took a bite.  Footage of the dental breakdown currently has over 82 million views on TikTok, showing a woman preparing to eat a piece of chocolate cake during what appears to be her birthday celebration.  However, when she attempts to taste the delectable looking cake, her dentures get stuck and are left lingering on the cake. Luckily, she sees the funny side, bursting into laughter over the mishap.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE5L21hbi0yMi1nZXRzLWRlbnR1cmVzLXN0dWNrLW5lYXItbHVuZy1hZnRlci1hY2NpZGVudGFsbHktc3dhbGxvd2luZy10aGVtL9IBamh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE5L21hbi0yMi1nZXRzLWRlbnR1cmVzLXN0dWNrLW5lYXItbHVuZy1hZnRlci1hY2NpZGVudGFsbHktc3dhbGxvd2luZy10aGVtL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

He's being held on a $25,000 bond.  According to the criminal complaint, a bullet went through the victim's upper left thigh.  Authorities found out about the shooting third-hand. The complaint says Koleske called his mother, but the woman couldn't leave work, so she called her mother who then called 911.  Police and paramedics arrived at 5122 19th Ave. But Koleske and his girlfriend who also was inside initially refused to let them in.  When they got in, they found the three-year-old lying on a bed, crying, with a bath towel draped over her leg. Koleske said he tried to care for the girl himself by giving her Tylenol and wrapping the wound with a towel. He said he even tried using popsicles to help with the pain and slow the bruising.  The defendant maintained the gunshot came from outside of the house, But officers smelled gun powder from a freshly fired gun, and also recovered a bullet and a casing from the bedroom.  ""The defendant stated that because he was on probation he was never going to call the police or 911,"" the complaint reads. ""Det.

The gun Koleske allegedly used was never found. Police got a run around, and eventually determined that it may have been passed to another individual who had already sold it.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) released data this week on 2021 occupant protection in passenger vehicles, finding that of the 26,325 passenger vehicle occupants who died in accidents that year, 11,813 of them – almost 50% – were not restrained by seatbelts.  Officials have not reported unrestrained vehicle crash death numbers that high in a decade.  According to the report, at least 60% of occupants involved in a pickup truck accident who were killed in 2021 were not wearing a seatbelt, a significantly higher number than occupants in all other types of passenger vehicles, including SUV drivers, passenger car drivers, and van drivers.  Accident Fatalities on the Rise  The new report comes as the NHTSA is attempting to reduce a record surge in auto accident fatalities. A comprehensive overview of motor vehicle traffic crashes was released by the agency in April, indicating that deaths caused by car accidents in 2021 marked the largest increase in 20 years.  Such a dramatic rise in car accident deaths has been linked to riskier driver behavior during the Covid-19 pandemic, including speeding, driving under the influence of drugs and alcohol, and failure to wear seatbelts.  Unrestrained Pickup Truck Occupants Have Been At Higher Risk For Decades  Unbelted pickup truck occupants have been considered a high risk demographic for fatal car accidents for over 20 years, the NHTSA noted in a press release. However, the agency stressed that the new statistics are especially concerning.  According to the data, 60% of pickup truck drivers and 64% of pickup truck passengers killed in car crashes in 2021 were not wearing seatbelts. Comparatively, 49% of SUV drivers killed in a 2021 car crash were unrestrained, 47% of passenger car drivers killed in a 2021 car crash were unrestrained, and 44% of van drivers killed in a 2021 car crash were not wearing seatbelts.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFib3V0bGF3c3VpdHMuY29tL3BpY2t1cC10cnVjay1hY2NpZGVudC1zZWF0YmVsdC1yZXBvcnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

This is stated in a report from the West Iceland Police.  The conditions for performing rescue work were very difficult. The beach was accessible only by sea. The man was pronounced dead at the scene by a doctor who was the first to arrive on the scene, along with a rescue team, the announcement reported.  Slippery cliff face  It was raining with fog at the time of the accident and the cliff face was very slippery. The circumstances of the accident are being investigated by the West Iceland Police.  The police got the notice of the accident just before noon yesterday about a man who had fallen off the cliffs at Arnarstapi and was lying motionless in the beach below the cliffs.  In his mid seventies  The man who died in this accident was in his mid-seventies. The accident was reported to the police by a local tourist group. Jónas Ottósson, a police officer with the West Iceland Police said that the man had not been a foreign tourist.  The accident happened in a creek behind the marina at Arnarstapi and to get there was very difficult, according to Jónas.  “We need to go over the data we have just collected. We think we know what happened, but it needs to be confirmed,” he says, adding that the field research is complete.  Took time to procure a boat  Jón Þór Víglundsson, information officer of the ICE-SAR Landsbjörg, says that the conditions for rescue work were challenging. Rescue workers from Lífsbjörg rescue team in Snæfellsnesbær were preparing to set up lines and glide down to the shore when it was discovered that it was possible to get to the man from the ocean.  There was no lifeboat on site and it took quite a long time to get a boat from the marina at Arnarstapi because the coastal fishermen had prepared their fleet for the severe weather that lay ahead, according to Víglundsson.  A doctor on board the boat then confirmed that it was a fatal accident. A lifeboat later arrived from Snæfellsbær with police and ambulance crews on board to get the deceased from the scene.  The rescue work was completed about 1:30 pm yesterday. The lifeguards from Lífsbjörg were subsequently treated for trauma as is the norm when such events occur.  Asked if the Coast Guard helicopter had been called in for the accident, Jón Þór says it was on a different call at the same time. Arrangements were being made to get the patient from the helicopter on board an ambulance while it was assisting Arnarstapi, but before this, it was confirmed that it was a fatal accident. Therefore, the helicopter did not go to the scene.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vaWNlbGFuZG1vbml0b3IubWJsLmlzL25ld3MvbmV3cy8yMDIzLzA1LzE5L2ZhdGFsX2FjY2lkZW50X2F0X2FybmFyc3RhcGkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

In the company of two other passengers, Hart found himself in a distressing situation as the 1970 Plymouth Barracuda they were traveling in veered off the road, descending down an embankment. The aftermath of the crash led to Hart being airlifted to a Los Angeles hospital, where he underwent treatment for severe back injuries.  After several months, Kevin Hart decided to share a deeply personal revelation regarding the incident, admitting that he had deliberately downplayed the intensity of his pain during his recovery. The reason behind his deception was his fear that medical professionals would discourage him from attempting to regain his ability to walk.

Following the procedure, he spent a duration of 10 days in the hospital before transitioning to a rehabilitation facility, as reported by Entertainment Weekly. In an episode of his show Laugh Out Loud in 2019, Kevin Hart contemplated his life after the accident, revealing his immense challenges in carrying out even the simplest of tasks.  “I could not fu*king move. I could not wipe my a*s…I literally couldn’t do any of that. it makes you realize… you really are helpless. There was nothing I could do,” he said.

He expressed,  “You don’t realize that your back is connected to everything. So coming out of back surgery, everything changed… That’s when you get to see what really matters, who really matters.

It took two and a half weeks before Kevin Hart could finally move without the aid of a walker. During this challenging period, he leaned heavily on his family for assistance and unwavering support.

"accident","2021-10-25","Not Discerned","{""Merrillan"", ""Wisconsin"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T19:15:00","Neil “Moose” Kinder remembers grabbing his cellphone to answer his wife’s call shortly after colliding with three trees along a rural stretch of road near Merrillan, Wis. He remembers that he didn’t feel any pain, despite the cab of his pickup being crushed in around him after rolling over into a ditch. He remembers hearing birds settling back into those trees he disturbed.  But in a way, Kinder was lucky. He was remembering. He was still alive.  Kinder, 30, recalled that fateful day to a room of first responders, firefighters and medical personnel during Gundersen Health System’s Advances in Trauma Care symposium last week. He did so seated next to the nurse who cared for him during his hospital stay, as well as the flight crew of GundersenAIR that transported him to La Crosse before it was too late.  Kinder was driving down that road on a late October evening in 2021 when he lost control of his vehicle and left the road, only coming to rest after striking the trees.  “After I impacted, I laid there and realized that it did not look good,” he said, his voicing cracking. “I was trying to figure out what exactly I was going to do.”  That’s when his wife Ashley – who worried about Kinder’s safety on those roads after dark – called. He answered his blood-covered phone and told her what had happened.  “I remember the words that I said. I said, ‘Call 911. I’m in a ditch and I’m dying,’” he said.  Eventually, Kinder was transported by helicopter to La Crosse, and shortly after, Ashley and his parents arrived. He saw his mom, and as reality of the situation set in, he told her he was probably going to lose his leg. Then, in a cracking voice, his dad spoke.  “He said, ‘Neil, it’s already gone.’”  Kinder hadn’t realized that to extract him from his vehicle, his left leg had to be amputated above the knee at the scene.  “This made me understand mentally that it was gone,” he said. “There was no trying and failing to keep the leg and all the complications that go along with it.”  But instead of despair, Kinder felt something else.  “I just felt blessed to be alive for my family, no matter what the outcome was going to be,” he said. “I was given another chance to live.”  Kinder was about to begin the most grueling journey of his life, saturated with surgeries to repair the dozens of fractures he sustained. He was filled with staples, plates and screws, and finally, he was fitted for a prosthetic leg. Months of physical therapy and learning to walk again followed.  “The start of fittings was a challenge,” he said. “Not having any strength or balance in my core, lower back and hips, it was a huge challenge to overcome even trying to fit the prosthetic. … And it hurt. The tip of the stump just hurt.”  During his presentation, Kinder showed the group gathered a photo of his amputated limb that was taken by Shannon Brozak, a PA in Gundersen’s general surgery department. He shared it not for the shock value, but because of the value he places on that photo. It’s all he has left of the tattoo that was on the leg – a tire track with his daughter’s name beneath it.  “My oldest had a brush with death when she was 16 months old,” he said. “She was run over, and that was the tread pattern that ran her over.”  Kinder’s still in pain to this day, using medication to ease it just a bit. At its height, he was taking more than 50 pills a day. His parents altered the front half of their house to accommodate his needs. He still sleeps in a hospital bed to be as comfortable as possible. His mother has been a constant caretaker.  Despite those hardships, he’s thankful. The gratitude extends not only to his family, but to those who were on the scene that day who saved his life, and to those who assist in his recovery.  “I’d like to give a big thank you to the guys who took care of me, and the guys who are still taking care of me,” Kinder said. “You are just as important in the process as the support that I have at home. This is the Moose family. Thank you all.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFodHRwczovL2xhY3Jvc3NldHJpYnVuZS5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9idXNpbmVzcy9oZWFsdGgtY2FyZS9ndW5kZXJzZW4tcGF0aWVudC1ncmF0ZWZ1bC1mb3ItY2FyZS1hZnRlci1sb3NpbmctbGVnLWluLXBpY2t1cC10cnVjay1hY2NpZGVudC9hcnRpY2xlXzcyZjZjNTY2LWY2NGQtMTFlZC04OGExLTI3ZmUwYmIxNDE4ZS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"accident","2023-05-11","Not Discerned","{""Lynchburg"", ""Virginia"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T16:10:50","LYNCHBURG, Va. – Focused. Diligent. Determined. These were the words used to describe Josiah Fowler, a Liberty University sophomore student who lost his life in a tragic cycling accident near Lynchburg last week.  As we’ve reported previously, on the afternoon of May 11, Fowler, of McDonough, Georgia, was cycling solo on English Tavern Road in Campbell County when he was hit by a vehicle. Virginia State Police says he was transported to Roanoke Memorial Hospital, where he died the following morning. No charges have been filed, according to State Police.  Now, those at Liberty University are taking the time to remember the impact Fowler has had during his 20 years in this world.  Many can recall the time Fowler spent on the university’s triathlon team.  Head Coach Heather Gollnick, who will be speaking at his celebration of life service this Saturday at noon at First Baptist Church in Atlanta, said he was unlike any other athlete she has ever met.  “It was a true honor to coach Josiah,” said Gollnick. “He was without question one of the hardest workers on the team. In all my years of coaching, I honestly haven’t experienced an athlete who was more focused, diligent, and determined to learn what was for him a new sport, triathlon.”  Recent graduate and fellow team member JJ Bagans was heartbroken by the news, which came on the first day of Liberty University’s 50th Commencement.  “It’s just a shock,” Bagans said. “A bunch of us were with him early that (Thursday) morning at another one of our friends’ graduation ceremonies. He brought us all graduation cards with a smile on his face. He was one of the purest souls that I’ve ever met, selfless and giving. He didn’t run this race on earth for himself; he ran it for God and for others, as was evident by what he was doing on his last day, celebrating someone else. He wanted to watch us all graduate before he went home.”  As many continue to mourn the loss, Liberty’s interim president, Jerry Prevo, issued a statement on behalf of Liberty:  We are deeply saddened by the loss of this exceptional young man, a brother in Christ, and we will be praying for his family and friends during this very difficult time. We know as believers in the Lord Jesus Christ that Josiah is in the arms of the Savior and that one day we will all be united with each other again.

"accident","2023-05-17","10:00:00","{""Jacksonville"", ""Florida"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T17:02:22","This is a carousel. Use Next and Previous buttons to navigate  A story map created by two Jacksonville seniors that shows all vehicle accidents that have happened in town in the past six years took first place in a statewide competition and will go on to national competition.  Seniors Rachel Lay and Grace Newman created a map pinpointing more than 2,000 accidents to identify areas where a higher number of accidents occur.  ""Growing up, Rachel and I have seen and heard about several traffic accidents that have happened throughout the 18 years we have been alive,"" Newman said. ""We were inspired to do this project because of two separate car accidents that happened recently to students that go to school in Jacksonville ... One of the accidents was at a two-way intersection and the student survived with only a couple minor injuries. The other student was also at a two-way intersection, but unfortunately the accident was fatal.""  The girls worked with Jacksonville Police Chief Adam Mefford to get details of every accident from 2017 through 2022 before plotting them on the map.  They also received data from the Illinois Department of Transportation on traffic patterns, including the number of vehicles that travel through an intersection on any given day.  Using that, they were able to compare the number of accidents to the amount of traffic to see when areas are the most dangerous, Lay said. Streets such as Morton Avenue have a high volume of vehicles and a higher number of accidents but, compared to other intersections, the number of accidents is low compared to the amount of traffic, she said.  ""We believe density is not a cause,"" Lay said. ""We also found that the Central Park Plaza one-way intersection is an area of significance on this map because it had a high amount of accidents for the rate of annual average daily traffic.""  The pair identified several areas that show a high number of accidents in comparison to their traffic volume: the south entrance to the downtown square, and the intersections of West College Avenue and Park Street, West College Avenue and South Church Street; West Lafayette Avenue and North Prairie Street, and Walnut and North Main streets.  Each intersection has its own set of circumstances that Lay and Newman believe leads to a higher amount of accidents.  At the square, limited signage noting the one-way traffic flow could contribute to the problem, Newman said.  At West College Avenue and Park Street, it is only a two-way stop and has limited visibility because of parked cars, she said.  At Walnut and North Main streets, a flashing light and a change in speed coming south into town could confuse drivers, the pair said.  ""There was a wide association between the number of stop signs and the number of accidents,"" Lay said. ""It appears that the four-way stops are safer than two-ways stops or the one-way roads.""  The project took about a month to complete once the data was received, Lay said.  The project was submitted to a state competition and won first place, earning the pair the right to represent the state in a national competition.  Jacksonville High School geography teacher Jim Chelsvig said this is the fourth project the school has submitted to the state competition and the fourth to finish in first place.  JHS has yet to take the top spot in the national competition, but Chelsvig is hopeful about this project.  ""I feel like this is one of our most complete sets of analysis,"" Chelsvig said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm15am91cm5hbGNvdXJpZXIuY29tL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS9qaHMtc3R1ZGVudC1wcm9qZWN0LWFjY2lkZW50cy1qYWNrc29udmlsbGUtdGFrZXMtMTgxMDQ3NDAucGhw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"accident","2023-05-17","Not Discerned","{""WestChesterTownship"", ""Ohio"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T14:21:39","Pay attention for five minutes and you’ll see an Amazon or other delivery truck. This highlights a concern with the continued growth of Amazon and its web of delivery providers: who is responsible when those delivery vehicles are involved in accidents?  Despite the fact that Amazon dictates the routes and schedules of the majority of delivery vehicles – the company is increasingly using delivery providers other than the USPS – Amazon has tried through legal techniques to limit its liability in the event one of the drivers is involved in an accident. The company has done this in part through what are known as hold harmless, or indemnification agreements. These agreements ensure that the delivery companies take responsibility for accidents, even where their drivers are rushing in order to keep to Amazon's notoriously difficult schedules.  And this is concerning, because with the ubiquity of delivery services, accidents are inevitable.  So, who is responsible?  The answer is the owner/operator of the vehicles, which may be sufficient if that they have adequate insurance. The problem arises where the company does not have adequate insurance to cover damages.  Let's look at an example: Smithco operates a delivery service. The company's primary contract is with Amazon to delivery its packages. Smithco maintains a $500,000 liability policy on its vehicles.  John, a Smithco driver, is exhausted, having worked a twelve-hour day delivering for the company, but in order to satisfy Amazon's requirements, must make one last delivery. Tired and not paying complete attention, John looks down at his phone and doesn't see Tim, a pedestrian, crossing the street. He hits Tim, causing severe and permanent injuries.  Amazon, of course, claims that it has no responsibility because it does not own the vehicle and does not employ the driver. Smithco's insurance company will likely pay the entire amount of its insurance policy, but this isn't enough.  In this case, Tim would, after exhausting the insurance policy of Smithco, look to his own insurance policy's SUM, or UM coverage. This coverage provides for supplemental benefits where the wrongdoer's insurance is insufficient to cover the damages. The critical thing here, however, is that Tim must have taken proactive steps to ensure that his SUM/UM limits were high, because if he did not, his carrier would likely have only given him the New York mandated minimum of $25,000.  Assessing and determining liability following an accident can be a complex and confusing process.

That colleague was State Senator Dan Roberts. Roberts had been in the midst of carrying legislation on the Senate floor when he received the news.  Congressman Gary Palmer said on Facebook, “I am heartbroken to hear the news my pastor, Harry Reeder, has passed away. Dr. Reeder was more than a pastor, he was a dear friend, mentor, and a man who understood and exemplified Godly leadership. Harry had an enormous impact on the lives of countless men and women. I will miss his teaching and his friendship, but I’m confident in knowing that one day I will see him again.

He graciously accepted with nothing to gain for himself. He only came from a desire to impact legislators with the gospel and to be with Senator Dan Roberts for Alabama. He arrived last night and visited with me for about an hour. We met early this morning and he spoke to our group. Only God knew it would be his last message as he never made it home. Hear the entire story and my tribute. We hurt his family and the church but Harry is now truly home.”  Members of the Briarwood Congregation were informed in a statement from the Church on Facebook that read as follows:  “Dear Congregation,  It is with a deeply heavy heart that I communicate to you that our Lord has called Pastor Reeder home through a car accident. Please pray for Cindy, Jennifer, Ike, Abby, and their entire family as well as our staff and church family as we all grieve this tremendous loss together.  But we do not grieve without hope because we know our pastor is with His Savior and has been received by grace with – “Well done My good and faithful servant.”  In Christ our Lord!

The incident highlights the persistence of human trafficking in the mountainous border region, where there has long been a trade in agricultural goods and workers coming from Vietnam to the relatively poor Chinese province of Guangxi.  One of the other victims was Chinese and the nationality of the other has yet to be determined, according to the social media account of the local Jingxi county government.  They were among 14 people aboard an off-road vehicle that overturned and fell into a gully, the government said.  It said the incident was related to human smuggling.  The survivors included the Chinese driver, a Chinese assistant and two Vietnamese citizens, all of whom are being questioned, the government said.  Limited job opportunities in parts of Vietnam have prompted some of its citizens to seek their fortunes in countries where wages are higher, including in marginally better-off parts of China, where they work on farms and in factories and where some women have been lured into forced marriages.  In 2019, the bodies of 39 young Vietnamese were found in a container truck in southeastern England in an apparent people-smuggling tragedy.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2NoaW5hLXZpZXRuYW0taHVtYW4tc211Z2dsaW5nLWJvcmRlci1hY2NpZGVudC1hNWExZDIyMmE1OTMxZDBmZmFmNWQyNGFlY2UwMzZmZtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(WNCN) — A family in Raleigh is turning a traumatic situation into an opportunity to help others.  Wyatt Fleming and his bearded dragon, Mushu (Chloe Rafferty/CBS 17)  They want to use their story to spread awareness.  Wyatt Fleming is an active seven-year-old who loves riding his bike and has a special bond with his bearded dragon, Mushu, who has the same amputation as he does.  Two years ago, Wyatt was playing in the yard when he had a traumatic run-in with a lawnmower.  “I was backing up and I heard it getting closer and closer and I finally turned around and it was right there,” Wyatt explained.  Megan Standish-Fleming showing where the accident happened (Chloe Rafferty/CBS 17)  His mom, Megan Standish-Fleming, got the call while she was at work.  “It was such a shock when I lifted up that blanket and I saw one foot,” she said. “And the first thing Wyatt said to me was, ‘Mommy, why weren’t you there?’”  Since then, the family’s focus has been on healing.  “I wanted to make something better out of that really bad day,” Standish-Fleming explained.  They visited the Fairview Fire Department to thank the first responders who saved Wyatt’s life the day of the accident.  They also got involved with the nonprofit, North Carolina Adapted Sports, where Wyatt met others just like him.  “They opened the door, ‘Hey Wyatt!’ My son’s eyes got about that big around because at five years old he hadn’t seen another amputee, not that he was even aware of,” Standish-Fleming said.  The organization gave Wyatt opportunities like rock climbing and also gave him a special bike — his new favorite thing.  “I loved it!” Wyatt exclaimed.  He also got several prosthetic legs from Del Bianco Prosthetics.  “Watching him be able to do it and hearing him be so excited, ‘Mom, look at me, look look look!’ was the greatest feeling in the world,” Standish-Fleming said.  She now serves on the nonprofit’s board, using her family’s story to help others.  “Getting involved in sports really helps,” she said.  On Sunday, the North Carolina Adapted Sports organization will host its first Bike Rodeo, Helmet Safety Check, and Touch-A-Truck fundraiser.

For people that drive this highway frequently, they don't always think it's the road causing these accidents, but rather human error.  Kevin Hohe says he drives through the Gallatin Canyon often during the winter months, and he believes accidents happen due to drivers' speed.  “If you're grabbing your brakes all the time and you don't use the turnouts, you're going to irritate everybody behind you and people are going to get impatient and bad things are going to happen,” says Hohe.  Montana Highway Patrol Sergeant Cody Ruane says most accidents have to do with careless driving and people getting impatient on the two lanes in the canyon.  “They'll cross on double-yellow lines, improper passing and clipping other vehicles, forcing them into ditches,"" says Sergeant Ruane, ""or even through the winter periods, they'll slide right off and crash into the guardrails or off the side into the ditch as well.”  Ruane says accidents on Highway 191 are on par with last year. From January 1 to May 1 last year, there were 28 accidents, and this year there are 24. There were 13 injury crashes last year, and this year there have been 10 with one fatality.  Sergeant Ruane says there are ways to help prevent accidents.  “There are plenty of turnouts to use if you want to do your Sunday driving, but you need to be aware of those turnouts,"" says Sergeant Ruane. ""Take them when people start backing up behind you. That's what leads to people being impatient and ultimately going to road rage.”  Hohe believes, “If you're not comfortable to drive the speed limit on the road, you probably shouldn't drive the road.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rYnprLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvbWhwLXNheXMtYWNjaWRlbnRzLW9uLWhpZ2h3YXktMTkxLWFyZS1vbi1wYXItd2l0aC1sYXN0LXllYXItZm9sbG93aW5nLXR3by1hY2NpZGVudHMtdGhpcy13ZWVr0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

On the night of April 28, a golf cart carrying four people was struck from behind by an alleged drunk driver near Charleston, South Carolina, killing 34-year-old Samantha Miller and critically injuring her new husband, Aric Hutchinson, and two others. The couple had just celebrated their wedding earlier that day.  ""Sam's just got that glow. She's the type that walks in a room, and you notice,"" Hutchinson said.  Aric Hutchinson kisses Samantha Miller in an undated photo. Courtesy Aric Hutchinson  Hutchinson spoke to ""Good Morning America"" in his first interview since the tragic accident that killed his wife, sharing how he's coping with the immense loss after what he said had been a perfect day.  ""I'm still trying to wrap my head around it. That night, going from an all-time high to an all-time low, it's pretty rough to try to comprehend,"" Hutchinson said.  He said the couple had been surrounded by friends and family who had traveled from all over the country.  Samantha Miller and Aric Hutchinson in an undated photo. Courtesy Aric Hutchinson  ""She was so happy. I mean, planning a wedding, as most people know, is extremely stressful. And she just had a weird, like, calmness that night,"" said Hutchinson, who added that the wedding and reception were one of the best nights of his life.  According to a GoFundMe set up by Hutchinson's mother, Hutchinson broke both legs, parts of his face and his back, and suffered brain bleeds and numerous cuts in the accident. The two others in the golf cart with Hutchinson and Miller suffered injuries including severe road rash and open wounds, according to Charleston ABC affiliate WCIV.  The last thing I remember her saying was she wanted the night to never end.  Hutchinson said he doesn't remember the crash but remembers the last thing his wife told him.  ""I do remember the last thing I remember her saying was she wanted the night to never end,"" said Hutchinson, who said the next thing he remembered was waking up in the hospital room, asking ""Where's Sam?""  ""That's when [my mother] told me there's an incident and that Sam didn't make it,"" he added.  Samantha Miller kisses Aric Hutchinson in an undated photo. Courtesy Aric Hutchinson  The driver of the vehicle that struck the golf cart, Jamie Komoroski, 25, was arrested and charged with three counts of DUI causing serious bodily injury/death and one count of reckless homicide. Komoroski was allegedly driving 65 mph in a 25 mph zone when the crash happened, according to a police report released by the Folly Beach Department of Public Safety. According to the toxicology report, Komoroski's blood alcohol level was more than three times the legal limit.  An attorney for Komoroski shared a statement after her arrest, saying: ""We cannot fathom what the families are going through and offer our deepest sympathies. We simply ask that there not be a rush to judgment. Our court system is founded upon principles of justice and mercy and that is where all facts will come to light.""  On Wednesday, Hutchinson filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Komoroski and several local bars and restaurants where she allegedly drank the night of the crash. Komoroski's employer and supervisor were also named in the lawsuit and are accused of ""pressuring"" her to attend a function and consume ""excessive amounts of alcoholic beverages"" the night of the accident, according to the lawsuit.  Komoroski's employer said in a statement there was not an ""officially organized employee function around drinking"" and Komoroski had just started training for the job.  Hutchinson said he's not ready to address Komoroski at this time.  ""I can't right now,"" he said. ""I'd like to. I mean, she stole an amazing human being that should not have been taken.""

However, that foundation was shaken within the past two years after McBryde and a bandmate both suffered serious, life-threatening accidents.  McBryde's accident occurred in September 2021 when a horse she was riding in Montana sped off uncontrollably. She fell off the horse and became unconscious upon hitting the ground, requiring ""life-saving"" measures to keep her breathing. She also suffered a concussion and a broken pelvis.  Thankfully, McBryde healed up and was able to resume touring. The band was handed another blow in December 2022, however, when bandmate Wes Dorethy suffered a ""near-fatal"" UTV accident. According to Dorethy's post about the situation, he underwent emergency surgery that saved his life, but still faced a long road to recovery.  When talking with Taste of Country's Adison Haager at the 2023 ACM Awards, McBryde says in the aftermath of both incidents, she and her band have made a concerted effort to treat each other and themselves with kindness.  Since then, only good things have followed.  ""We're taking better care of each other and better care of ourselves,"" she says. ""Since we started doing those things on purpose — it's not like we were crappy to each other — we started being more mindful about it, then I became a member of the Grand Ole Opry, and then I won a Grammy, and then we headlined RodeoHouston. All these amazing things, all this hard work that we've been putting in all these years has started paying off.""  The singer shared that even 18 months after her horseback riding accident, she was still struggling with vertigo and unable to do things she loves. She adds that the incidents have motivated herself and her bandmates to simply ""make better choices"" and stay healthy.  ""I was just like, 'Wow, that was so bad. It was so bad,'"" she says of the incident. ""We have to take better care of ourselves. So, right now no one's riding as much as a scooter. No ATVs, no skateboards, no horses.""  The two near-death experiences for herself and Dorethy also changed McBryde's songwriting process, as she now looks at life with newfound gratitude.  ""Songwriting-wise, it feels sort of like you can walk into the room knowing no matter what we create today, the thing that I wanted to be when I grew up, I am,"" she says. ""So, even if we don't get a song today, I'm so happy about who we are and the season that we're walking into.""  Despite her disastrous horseback riding session in 2021, McBryde says she will ride a horse again in the future, and she's working with a therapist to ward off any negative psychological effects from the accident.

Ron DeSantis would extend liability protections to private aerospace companies if crew members are injured or killed in spaceflights.  The legislation (SB 1318) was among 62 bills DeSantis received Tuesday. He has until May 31 to act on the proposal.  With the state seeing growth in private launches, the bill would cover crew members who are employees or contractors of companies such as SpaceX and others.  Senate bill sponsor Tom Wright, a New Smyrna Beach Republican who chairs the Senate Military and Veterans Affairs, Space and Domestic Security Committee, said earlier this year the proposal “would adapt Florida law to address the evolution of space flight, allowing company employees of SpaceX, Boeing, Blue Origin and so forth to fly to space under this.”  The law doesn’t cover ground crew members or change workers’ compensation rules.  The measure isn’t the only legislation now on DeSantis’ desk that has a tie to the space industry.

But the former WWE superstar and current movie star revealed how a chance encounter got him cast in Barbie.  When appearing on The Today Show, Cena cited a “happy accident” as the reason he was cast in Barbie. He first compared the Barbie film and the Fast & Furious franchise saying that the two have some parallels including “amazing” cast lists for both films. He then revealed that he pitched himself for the film during an accidental run-in with Robbie.  “We literally randomly ran into each other as friends. Fast X was filming right across the street from Barbie and they said ‘Why don’t you do Barbie?’ I said, ‘I’ve been trying,’ and Margot makes a lot of decisions for that and I said, ‘Well, I’ll do whatever you need,'” said Cena, who also revealed that he is playing a merman in the film.  John Cena has become a rising star in Hollywood after being the face that ran WWE for over a decade. In recent years, he transitioned into acting full-time and even starred with Margot Robbie in James Gunn‘s The Suicide Squad a couple of years back. He also starred in F9 in 2021 as Jakob Toretto, brother of Dom (Vin Diesel), and will reprise his role in Fast X.

"accident","2023-05-07","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Fri 19 May 2023 00:50:06","Tragedy recently struck in the Albarkawa area of Zamfara State when eight people died in a boat accident. Residents of the community explain to MAIHARAJ ALTINE how the young women and children died while searching for potable water  Gusau, the Zamfara State, capital has recorded several boat accidents as a result of the struggle by the inhabitants to get water from the river very close to the town as both the state and the federal governments have over the years failed to provide the over 500,000 residents with potable water.  The people of the town particularly women and children have to go to the river in canoes to fetch water for domestic purposes, despite the inherent dangers involved. This is because it is the only source of getting water whenever there is water scarcity in the town.  Although many boat accidents have occurred in the town in the past, the one that happened on May 7 when seven children and a prospective bride lost their lives was the most pathetic.  It was very pathetic in the sense that, the victims were mainly women and children among them was a girl called Zainab Yusuf who was about to get married. Her younger brother Aliyu Yusuf was also among those who lost their lives in the incident.  Both Zainab and Aliyu came from one poor family whose parents depended solely on them for drinking water as they could not afford to buy water from vendors who sell a Jerry can of water at N150.  Aged 18, Zainab Yusuf lost her life in a tragic boat accident a few weeks before her wedding which was slated to take place before the end of this month.  Speaking to The PUNCH, the father of the late Zainab, Lawal Yusuf expressed disgust over the incident which he described as the worst thing that ever happened to him.  He said, “I will never forget this throughout my life because I was not at home when the incident happened.  “I was away from home when my neighbour called me on the phone and told me that both my daughter, Zainab and my son Aliyu had died in boat accident.  “I nearly fainted but managed to come home where I met the two corpses lying on the floor.”  Although Yusuf described the incident as an act of God, he, however, blamed both the state and the federal governments for their failure to provide Gusau with potable water.  According to him, the inability of the appropriate authorities to provide water to the inhabitants of the town is the major reason why the people have to go to the river to get water.  “You see, we have to send our wards to the river to fetch water for our domestic purposes because that is the only alternative as the government failed to supply us with drinking water,” he lamented.  He maintained that several lives were lost in the river explaining that, “People will continue to die there, as long as the government fails to address the issue of water scarcity in the town.”  He called on the state government to do something urgently to arrest the current water scarcity in the state capital.  Also speaking, the mother of the two deceased children, Fatima Adamu, said, she sent them to the river on the fateful day to fetch water for the family as according to her, there was no water in the house.  “There was no water in the house on that day, so I asked Zainab and Aliyu to go to the river and get water so that we can cook food and do other domestic activities because it’s the only source of water in this area”.  “As I waited for them to come back, I heard people shouting, saying that, there was a boat accident and many children were in the river”.  “I rushed to the scene to see what was really happening because my children were there.”  “As soon as I reached the river, I met some people trying to rescue those who were under the water”.  “As I waited impatiently by the river bank, I just saw my daughter’s dead body being carried out of the river by the rescuers.  “Some minutes later, the corpse of my son, Aliyu was also discovered and brought out of the water. This made me scream heavily and fell on the ground”.  Fatima explained that all arrangements for the wedding of her late daughter were completed, adding, “We planned to send her to her husband’s house before the end of this month (May.)”  One of the rescuers, Muddasir Sani, said he brought out about seven corpses including that of Zainab.  Sani maintained that the accident happened as a result of overloading, explaining that, “The canoe was supposed to convey only 12 persons but there were over 20 people with their Jerry cans.”  He stated that as the canoe was moving, it capsized and sunk into the river and everybody in it went under the water because none of them was able to swim.  “I personally evacuated seven corpses including that of the girl who was about to get married.”  The community leader of the Albarkawa area where the incident occurred, Yahaya Yusuf, said he witnessed the rescue of some children as well as the evacuation of some corpses.  Yusuf added maintained that six children were saved by the rescuers and eight dead bodies were evacuated, adding that more children were still missing.  He said, “I was around when six children were rescued and eight dead bodies were also recovered”.  Yusuf stated that the people of the area were in dire need of potable water, adding that, whenever there was water scarcity in the town, the people of the area had to go to the river to fetch water as it was the only alternative.  He lamented that between March to May this year, there were three boat accidents which claimed many lives.  He called on the state government to do something urgently to address the issue of water scarcity.  “I am using this medium to appeal to the state government to please come to our aid and provide our people with good drinking water so as to alleviate the suffering of our people”.  “We wrote so many complaints to the state government many years ago but nothing was done.  “Our children don’t go to school whenever there is water scarcity. Many of them have to go to the river to get water for their parents, despite the danger involved in the process.”  Our correspondent gathered that the residents had to be conveyed in boats to fetch water from a part of the river that they considered potable.  But the state Commissioner for Water Resources, Ibrahim Isa Mayana in an interview with The PUNCH, said the problem of water scarcity would soon be over.  Mayana who earlier argued that the boat accident had nothing to do with the water scarcity said normal water supply had been restored to Gusau.  He stated, “Normal water supply was restored in the town two days ago. The eight persons who lost their lives in the river did not go there to fetch water. They were going for another thing went their boat capsized”.  “I am telling you, that, those who have died in the river as a result of the boat accident did not go there to fetch water. They were going somewhere when the incident happened.  However, the state police command confirmed the death of eight persons in the boat mishap.  The command called on the people of the state to always monitor the movement of their wards and check their whereabouts, especially during rainfall.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vcHVuY2huZy5jb20vYm9hdC1hY2NpZGVudC13YXRlci1zY2FyY2l0eS1wdXNoZXMtemFtZmFyYS1jaGlsZHJlbi13b21lbi10by1kZWF0aC_SAVxodHRwczovL3B1bmNobmcuY29tL2JvYXQtYWNjaWRlbnQtd2F0ZXItc2NhcmNpdHktcHVzaGVzLXphbWZhcmEtY2hpbGRyZW4td29tZW4tdG8tZGVhdGgvP2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

While considered one of the most preventable causes of death, municipal police and RCMP are confronted daily with individuals who, for whatever reason, think they can safely drive while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.  In 2020, more than 2,000 drivers in Nova Scotia were charged with impaired-related offences.  The penalties for such offences include the loss of a driver’s license for at least one year (longer for additional convictions), a fine beginning at $1,000 (fines are increased on subsequent convictions) and acquiring a criminal record. There are also fees associated with reinstating a license along with higher insurance fees as a result of an impaired conviction.  In Canada, the prohibited blood-alcohol concentration (BAC) level is 80 milligrams or more (mg) of alcohol per 100 millilitres (ml) of blood.  For cannabis (THC), there are two prohibited levels for THC (the active ingredient in marijuana): it is a less serious offence to have between 2 nanograms (ng) and 5 ng of THC per ml of blood. It is a more serious offence to have 5 ng of THC or more per ml of blood.  The prohibited levels of alcohol and cannabis, when found in combination, is 50 mg or more of alcohol per 100 ml blood and 2.5 ng or more of THC per ml of blood.  Having detectable levels of other drugs such as LSD, psilocybin, or cocaine in your system within two hours of driving is also prohibited.  As part of National Safe Driving Week, Cape Breton Regional Police staged a mock, single-vehicle accident involving an impaired (by drugs) driver and then walked reporters through the steps that officers must take to properly investigate such an event.  The driver, played by Const. Marvin MacDonald, was deemed to be impaired by marijuana. A passenger in the vehicle he was driving was rejected when the vehicle rolled over and later died in hospital.  One of the first police units to attend an impaired accident scene is the traffic safety unit, specifically an accident reconstructionist. Const.

"accident","2023-05-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 21:43:42","Mining has increased dramatically on the Tibetan Plateau – and with it pollution and degradation.  View of a river polluted by mining in Maldrogongkar county, western China's Tibet Autonomous Region, in an undated photo.  A search is underway for six workers who went missing after a lift cage fell at a Chinese-backed copper mine in Tibet during shaft construction of an open-pit mine drainage system project, forcing production to stop.  The accident occurred May 14 at the Julong Copper and Polymetallic Mine site operated by Tibet Julong Copper Co. Ltd. in copper-rich Gyama township in Meldrogunkar county of Lhasa prefecture. China’s Zijin Mining Group Co. Ltd. owns a 50.1% stake in the subsidiary.  The six missing miners work at Fujian Xingwanxiang Construction Group Co., Ltd., subcontracted by Tibet Julong Copper Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of Zijin Mining Group, to perform the project construction. Their names and ethnic identities have not been released.  After the accident, Julong Copper began an emergency and rescue plan and reported the incident to the relevant government departments, Zijin Mining Group said Monday in a statement filed with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and posted on the company’s website.  Julong Copper also suspended production and was investigating the incident, which “led to the loss of contact with six Xingwanxiang staff members,” it said.  “The company will continue to pay attention to the Incident, and discharge its information disclosure obligations in a timely manner,” the statement said.  Zijin Mining Group has not posted any updates, and did not respond to attempts to gather more information.  It owns three sites in Tibet, which generate nearly half of the company’s revenue, said Dhondup Wangmo, a research fellow at the Tibet Policy Institute in Dharamsala, India.  Expansion of mining  Mining and mineral exploration have increased dramatically on the Tibetan Plateau since 2006 following the arrival of the Golmud-Lhasa railway link and Chinese government programs and promotion.  With it has come an increase in pollution and a destruction of pasture land, prompting Tibetan protests over harm caused to the environment and local livestock.  A surge in the Chinese government’s mining activities in Meldrogunkar’s Gyama Valley began as early as in the 1980s and has yielded valuable resources such as gold and copper for products benefiting China’s economy, said a Tibetan from the area who now lives in exile.  “But it has come at the cost of environmental degradation and the relocation of Tibetan nomads who grazed their animals there,” said the source who asked that his identity not be disclosed.  “The forced settlement of nomads is a policy that China’s Communist Party has been pushing for years in Tibet,” he said.  The increased mining activity also led to pollution and contaminated water sources that killed animals who drank from them, he said.  “Tibetans in the region have protested over the years — many have been detained and many imprisoned as well,” the Tibetan said.  Operations at one Gyama copper and gold mine was the scene of a catastrophic landslide that killed 83 people, mostly Chinese migrant workers in March 2013, drawing attention to the toll that mining and industrialization were having in Tibet.

Two pilots were in the aircraft but it was not clear who was at the controls. After approximately 20 minutes of circuits, the pilots then flew a low pass parallel to Runway 03, followed by a steep right turn passing over several people while steeply banked and at 72 ft above the ground. During this turn, the aircraft was seen to descend and hit the ground – both pilots were fatally injured.  The investigation could not determine exactly why the aircraft descended in the turn, but no defects could be found with the aircraft or its engine. There was evidence that the aircraft’s electronic displays lost power before the accident and this could have caused a distraction for the pilots. However, the aircraft was being flown in a manner that exposed the aircraft, the occupants and the people on the ground to a high risk of an accident.  While not contributing to the outcome, the investigation identified several shortcomings in the build process of the aircraft and the registration of its ballistic parachute recovery system. The Light Aircraft Association (LAA) and Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) have taken action to address these, with the LAA exploring ways to improve oversight of the build process within the 51% amateur building rules. In addition, during an inspection carried out immediately before the accident, the CAA identified shortcomings in the aerodrome’s safety management system, which the CAA has stated have now been addressed.

DSP Gurmukh Singh pacifying Dhanas residents who staged a protest over ‘police inaction’. (HT Photo)  Police said Mustafa Ansari, 23, of Dhanas died at PGIMER around 3.30 am on Thursday. After battling for life for nearly 24 hours, another victim, Bimlesh, 50, also breathed her last at PGIMER. On Wednesday, Rajwanti was crushed by the car. Four other victims remain hospitalised.  Even as the accident toll rose to three, police were still groping in the dark about the identity of the hatchback’s driver till late Thursday. Having a Punjab registration number (PB23-J-0001), the vehicle is registered in the name of Kamaljit Singh, a resident of Prabhat Road, Zirakpur, and one of the directors of a Zirakpur mall.  The FIR, meanwhile, lodged under Section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of the Indian Penal Code has nominated no accused. If proven, the charge is punishable with imprisonment for life or imprisonment up to 10 years.  Sources in the police said a family member of the car owner was behind the wheel.  Speaking to HT, Kamaljit’s brother said while his relative was present in the car, it was being driven by a driver who fled the spot after the accident.  On other hand, people present at the spot claimed that there were only two people in the car, including a woman. Amid victims’ cries for help, a woman wearing blue and black clothes was seen rushing towards the car, taking out a bag from the navigator side of the car and running away.  Police sources said though the red Beetle is registered at a Zirakpur address, the family is currently residing in Panchkula.  Sources said a police team visited the house of the suspect driver on Wednesday late evening but couldn’t find him. “His phone is also switched off. He also got injured in the accident and fled the spot. We have got vital leads but have not nominated anyone in the FIR, as the investigation is on,” a police officer on the condition of anonymity said.  “FIR was registered against unidentified car driver since there was no one on the spot except the car. Our teams are on the job to arrest the accused,” said Chandigarh SSP Kanwardeep Kaur.  A senior police officer said police will also check the Internet Protocol Detail Record (IPDR) of the suspect to know the exact route he followed and if he was at the accident spot.  Locals stage protest  Meanwhile, Dhanas residents staged a sit-in against absence of CCTV cameras and defunct traffic lights at the EWS Chowk in Dhanas where the accident took place. The protesters also sought the arrest of the accused and warned cops against arresting the wrong person. DSP Gurmukh Singh assured the protesters of fair action.  Police said a team of engineering and traffic experts also visited the spot on Thursday morning. A few protesters also claimed that they saw the man who was behind the wheel.  Among them, Mohammad Jia Ul claimed that he heard the driver requesting a cop to drop him to PGIMER, but the cop asked him to go in a private vehicle. He managed to flee as everyone was busy rescuing the victims, Mohammad added.

According to The Daily Mail, on Wednesday, May 17, Pullos was driven by her father to a Malibu detox and residential treatment facility, which cost roughly $2,600 a week. The outlet notes the location “boasts several alcohol and drug addiction treatments, ranging from a ten-day long detox to a more intensive medication-assisted treatment with a residential option for round-the-clock care.  “An intensive outpatient program is then offered as a transition, as well as an aftercare program for those who use the facilities.”  Just before 1:30 a.m. on Saturday, April 29, Pullos reportedly drove her vehicle the wrong way on the 134 freeway before colliding head-on with a 23-year-old male driver of a Kia who suffered major injuries and rushed to an area hospital. Pullos herself required help from the Pasadena Fire Department who used the jaws of life to extract her from the wrecked 2019 Ford she was driving.  Before the accident, Pullos was also reportedly involved in a hit-and-run with another vehicle, an Oldsmobile driven by a 27-year-old woman from Fontana in the westbound lane, which did not result in any serious injuries. According to a police report, “It was determined Haley Pullos was involved in a hit and run traffic collision that occurred in the city of Pasadena prior to entering the wrong way onto the eastbound SR-134 freeway.”  It’s unclear how long Pullos is expected to remain in the facility but The Daily Mail notes that if she “chooses a longer outpatient treatment of 15 weeks, it could cost up to $28,875.” The other option they point out is a detox of up to ten days which will cost about $3,750, while the available inpatient programs are priced at $5,400 for 90 days.“General Hospital” has temporarily recast the role of Molly Lansing-Davis with newcomer Holiday Mia Kriegel (“Bull,” “Animal Kingdom”).

"accident","2022-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 18:12:32","The number of U.S. workers who tested positive for marijuana following work-related accidents reached its highest level in a quarter-century last year, and researchers say the positive drug test increase correlates with more states legalizing cannabis recreationally and medicinally.  The new analysis released Thursday by Quest Diagnostics shows that workers who tested positive for THC, the psychoactive component of cannabis, following job site incidents increased to 7.3% in 2022 from 6.7% in 2021, and that the figures follow a steady increase in post-accident cannabis positivity each year between 2012 and 2022.  Analysts looked at more than 6.3 million urine tests across the general U.S. workforce, and found that year-over-year positivity increased in nine out of 15 industries examined during the 10-year period, and that over the most recent five years workforce drug positivity increased in every industry category.  Marijuana positivity was highest in retail trade and accommodation and food services, while cocaine positivity also increased in 12 out of 15 industries during the study period.  The study shows that the combined U.S. workforce positivity for all drugs in 2022 was at the highest level in two decades, and that the 2021 and 2022 positivity rates were the highest they have been since 2001.  While the main focus was on marijuana, the study also showed that amphetamine use was also on the rise among U.S. workers, with positive drug tests for amphetamines increasing by 15.4% in 2022. The amphetamine data, researchers noted, does not differentiate between illicit drugs and prescribed medications.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zdXJhbmNlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjMwNTE4L05FV1MwOC85MTIzNTc1MjAvUG9zdC1hY2NpZGVudC13b3JrcGxhY2UtcG90LXRlc3RpbmctcmVhY2hlcy0yNS15ZWFyLWhpZ2gt0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Use Next and Previous buttons to navigate  A story map created by two Jacksonville seniors that shows all vehicle accidents that have happened in town in the past six years took first place in a statewide competition and will go on to national competition.  Seniors Rachel Lay and Grace Newman created a map pinpointing more than 2,000 accidents to identify areas where a higher number of accidents occur.  ""Growing up, Rachel and I have seen and heard about several traffic accidents that have happened throughout the 18 years we have been alive,"" Newman said. ""We were inspired to do this project because of two separate car accidents that happened recently to students that go to school in Jacksonville ... One of the accidents was at a two-way intersection and the student survived with only a couple minor injuries. The other student was also at a two-way intersection, but unfortunately the accident was fatal.""  The girls worked with Jacksonville Police Chief Adam Mefford to get details of every accident from 2017 through 2022 before plotting them on the map.  They also received data from the Illinois Department of Transportation on traffic patterns, including the number of vehicles that travel through an intersection on any given day.  Using that, they were able to compare the number of accidents to the amount of traffic to see when areas are the most dangerous, Lay said. Streets such as Morton Avenue have a high volume of vehicles and a higher number of accidents but, compared to other intersections, the number of accidents is low compared to the amount of traffic, she said.  ""We believe density is not a cause,"" Lay said. ""We also found that the Central Park Plaza one-way intersection is an area of significance on this map because it had a high amount of accidents for the rate of annual average daily traffic.""  The pair identified several areas that show a high number of accidents in comparison to their traffic volume: the south entrance to the downtown square, and the intersections of West College Avenue and Park Street, West College Avenue and South Church Street; West Lafayette Avenue and North Prairie Street, and Walnut and North Main streets.  Each intersection has its own set of circumstances that Lay and Newman believe leads to a higher amount of accidents.  At the square, limited signage noting the one-way traffic flow could contribute to the problem, Newman said.  At West College Avenue and Park Street, it is only a two-way stop and has limited visibility because of parked cars, she said.  At Walnut and North Main streets, a flashing light and a change in speed coming south into town could confuse drivers, the pair said.  ""There was a wide association between the number of stop signs and the number of accidents,"" Lay said. ""It appears that the four-way stops are safer than two-ways stops or the one-way roads.""  The project took about a month to complete once the data was received, Lay said.  The project was submitted to a state competition and won first place, earning the pair the right to represent the state in a national competition.  Jacksonville High School geography teacher Jim Chelsvig said this is the fourth project the school has submitted to the state competition and the fourth to finish in first place.  JHS has yet to take the top spot in the national competition, but Chelsvig is hopeful about this project.  ""I feel like this is one of our most complete sets of analysis,"" Chelsvig said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm15am91cm5hbGNvdXJpZXIuY29tL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS9qaHMtc3R1ZGVudC1wcm9qZWN0LWFjY2lkZW50cy1qYWNrc29udmlsbGUtdGFrZXMtMTgxMDQ3NDAucGhw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The car was totaled, leaving him with a severed right femur. After he was airlifted to a hospital, doctors told Wilson that he could have died. That moment, he said, changed everything.  For nearly half of his time at Seton School in Manassas, senior Wilson struggled with his faith. After the accident, however, “I began to see the big picture that I had been trying to see for the longest time,” he said. “There really is a God up there, and he’s looking out for me, and I have guardian angels always looking out for me.” Now, he offers every day to Christ, both the good and bad moments.  “I’m just looking at my life as a blessing from God, and I’m still here. So, I’m trying to just spread the positivity around and make sure that everyone can see the good in all situations.”  While in recovery, Wilson was confined to a wheelchair for two months at the beginning of the school year. This period of immobility was difficult for the student athlete, on Seton’s swim, basketball and lacrosse teams. Yet, with a determination to recover and regain strength in his leg, he worked with his physical therapist and found himself on crutches a month later. Two weeks after he put the crutches down, he was back in the pool, swimming for the school team and preparing to compete again.  “Thank God I was able to recover, because my doctors told me I wasn’t going to be able to walk until February.

A car, truck, or SUV sits in a damaged state while it awaits authorities to haul it off. In this case, a BMW 5-Series ended up not just damaged but on a power pole support wire. The driver’s reaction is surprising.  Brought to us by a poster over on Reddit, the short film shows a BMW 5-Series with its front wheels about five feet in the air. The accident itself isn’t shown on film but one way or another, the driver managed to put this 4,000+-pound sedan halfway into the sky before it came to rest.  “Yo, did that really just happen?” the cameraman asks moments before the driver falls out of the car. “Tell me this dude is not drunk,” they say. While there’s no clear indication of intoxication levels, it’s worth noting that the driver seems to attempt to dislodge the BMW by tugging on its trunk. Whether or not they understood that the car would then likely roll back onto them isn’t clear.  Read: Watch A Train Smash Through A Mercedes After Woman Ignores Roadsigns  It’s tough to tell exactly what went down but those seven-spoke wheels indicate that this is likely a 5-Series with the optional Sport package of its day. Whether it’s a six-cylinder or V8 is tougher to say because the video doesn’t show the badge clearly and the rear bumper is destroyed and obscured as well.  The E60 generation of the BMW 5-Series came with either rear or all-wheel drive. So it seems plausible that there might have existed a way to reverse the car off of the support wire given that it had enough traction.

On the night of April 28, a golf cart carrying four people was struck from behind by an alleged drunk driver near Charleston, South Carolina, killing 34-year-old Samantha Miller and critically injuring her new husband, Aric Hutchinson, and two others.  The couple had just celebrated their wedding earlier that day, ABC News reported previously.  Hutchinson spoke to “Good Morning America” in his first interview since the tragic accident that killed his wife, sharing how he’s coping with the immense loss after what he says had been a perfect day.  “She was so happy. I mean, planning a wedding, as most people know, is extremely stressful. And she just had a weird, like, calmness that night,” said Hutchinson, who added that the wedding and the reception were one of the best nights of his life.  According to a GoFundMe set up by Hutchinson’s mother, Hutchinson broke both legs, parts of his face, and his back, and suffered brain bleeds and numerous cuts in the accident. The two others in the golf cart with Hutchinson and Miller suffered injuries including severe road rash and open wounds, according to Charleston ABC affiliate WCIV.  The driver of the vehicle that struck the golf cart, Jamie Komoroski, 25, was arrested and charged with three counts of DUI causing serious bodily injury/death and one count of reckless homicide. Komoroski was allegedly driving 65 miles per hour in a 25 miles per hour zone when the crash happened, according to a police report released by the Folly Beach Department of Public Safety.  Hutchinson said he’s not ready to address the driver at this time.  “I can’t right now,” he said. “I’d like to.

"accident","2023-05-18","Not Discerned","{""Huntsville"", ""Alabama"", ""UnitedStates""}","Fri 19 May 2023 00:26:00","HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (WAFF) - The Guest Passenger Statute was written in Alabama during the Great Depression when there were not as many cars on the road. State lawmakers at the time hoped it would encourage people to carpool without fear of being sued in case of an accident.  The Guest Passenger Statute prevents anyone who is riding as a passenger from suing or filing an insurance claim against a driver who negligently causes an accident. A common example is someone running through a red light and hitting somebody.  In 2023, however, cars are everywhere and accidents happen every day. As a result, Bart Siniard, a personal injury attorney, says this law should no longer exist.  ”Nobody really knows this statute exists other than lawyers, judges, and people who have been affected by it,” said Siniard.  Sherri Hurst is Siniard’s client, who was on the wrong end of the Guest Passenger Statute.  “I had no idea, all I knew is I had been injured, and I went out to the insurance company, letting them know what had happened,” said Hurst. “Actually, the driver, it was her insurance so she reached out to them. And they denied it.”  Sherri Hurst had her foot run over accidentally by another driver while leaving the backseat passenger’s side of her family’s car. Her filed claim was denied, so she brought a lawsuit against the driver’s insurance company.  “We went to the Supreme Court and it took over five years to get this reconciled in order for me to be compensated,” Hurst said.  Though Hurst was eventually compensated, the law was never changed.  Siniard however argues the statute is unconstitutional.  He says it violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, by dividing the driver and passenger of a car into separate classes of people: the class of people who can be successful in personal injury claims and another who can’t be successful.  It took Hurst five years and a fight with the Alabama Supreme Court to be compensated, but she’s definitely learned a lesson from her unfortunate accident.  “I’ll drive myself where I need to go,” she laughed. “I don’t carpool much. Or I am in the front, and I make sure that I say ‘Okay I’m in the clear.’”  Click Here to Subscribe on YouTube: Watch the latest WAFF 48 news, sports & weather videos on our YouTube channel!

"accident","2022-05-11","Not Discerned","{""Prospect"", ""Connecticut"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 10:03:03","WASHINGTON — An inbound Metra BNSF Line train was traveling at 60.9 mph when it struck a 33,000-pound box truck at a grade crossing in Clarendon Hills, Ill., in a May 11, 2022, accident that killed a passenger, according to information in the accident docket released Wednesday by the National Transportation Safety Board.  The preliminary accident report was released in June 2022 [see “NTSB releases preliminary report …,” Trains News Wire, June 16, 2022]. The final report, which will determine probable cause and make any safety recommendations, is still pending. The docket, which consists of information gathered during the accident investigation, includes 59 documents with more than 500 pages of data.  Metra train 1242 is normally an all-stops train that would have been slowing for a stop in Clarendon Hills. It was running express because it was behind schedule after a delayed departure to change trainsets because of mechanical problems with the original equipment, according to a report from the rail Operations Group Chair. The train was traveling at 69.8 mph when the engineer spotted the truck stalled on the Prospect Avenue grade crossing and began braking. That group said the crew’s train handling was “not believed to be causal or a contributing factor in this accident.”  The passenger killed was later identified as 72-year-old Christina Lopez of Downers Grove, Ill., who was ejected from the cab car. The train’s conductor told investigators she believed that passenger had been sitting on the engineer’s side, three seats back from the mid-car entry and exit doors on the engineer’s side. That was the location that sustained the most damage, as the truck was rotated by the collision and then struck the lead car behind the doors.  Two other passengers and two crew members were also injured.  Reports at the time suggested the truck may have been caught on the crossing because of traffic resulting from road construction. A suit by Lopez’ family against Metra, BNSF, and Del’s Moving, owner of the truck, claims the road work created unsafe conditions [see “Family of Metra passenger killed … files suit,” June 23, 2022].  But the report on the driver’s actions indicates he told investigators truck’s engine “suddenly cut off” as the truck crossed the crossing, and when he attempted to restart it, the engine did not make any sound. After multiple restart attempts, he and the two other occupants of the truck exited the vehicle when they saw the train approaching. Crash damage made it impossible for investigators to test the truck’s drive train.  Just 48 seconds elapsed between the moment the truck stalled and the collision, based on security camera footage and data from a crossing gate device at Prospect Avenue. According to the timeline contained in the docket’s Signal and Highway Group Chairs’ Factual Report, the crossing gates’ lights activated 13 seconds after the truck stalled; the gates ere down 11 seconds later, and the collision occurred another 24 seconds after that. The 35 seconds of warning provided by the lights is well above the 20 seconds required by the Federal Railroad Administration.  Among other notable details from the docket:  — According to a medical report, the driver did not have a valid commercial driver medical certificate at the time of the crash, having failed to follow up on a request for information from his cardiologist about a recent heart attack. He also failed to undergo required post-accident U.S. Department of Transportation drug and alcohol testing.  — The truck was in violation of a Clarendon Hills ordinance regarding designated truck routes at the time of the collision, having failed to take the most direct route from the closest non-restricted street to reach its pickup point, according to the Signals and Highway report. The driver had followed directions from a GPS device that did not take truck routes into account.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50cmFpbnMuY29tL3Rybi9uZXdzLXJldmlld3MvbmV3cy13aXJlL21ldHJhLXRyYWluLWhpdC1zdGFsbGVkLXRydWNrLWF0LTYwLW1waC1pbi0yMDIyLWFjY2lkZW50LXRoYXQta2lsbGVkLXBhc3Nlbmdlci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Our thoughts, prayers, and full support are with his family,” said district Superintendent David A. Bolton in a statement Thursday.  The accident took place at roughly 10:50 p.m. on May 17 on the 200 block of Allentown Road, the Franconia Township Police Department announced earlier Thursday.  Arriving officers found that a 2016 BMW sedan had left the roadway and crashed into an occupied home. The car was “fully engulfed in flames,” according to police, and officers and members of the Souderton Fire Department worked to extinguish the fire before it spread to the house.  “The driver, and lone occupant of the vehicle, identified as a 16-year-old Sellersville resident was pronounced dead at the scene,” police said.  Five occupants inside the house were uninjured, and the house was inspected by Franconia’s fire marshal and code enforcement department, who declared the home structurally unsafe, police said. The family is being relocated and the house was secured by Moyer’s Restoration, according to police, and no officers, firefighters or members of the public were hurt.  In a statement Thursday afternoon, Bolton said the student was a junior at Pennridge High School, who had “joined the PHS family last year as a 10th grader and this year, he attended the Tech School for Automotive and received his high school courses through our cyber programming.”  “This loss is sure to raise many emotions, concerns, and questions for our entire school community, especially our students, their families, and our staff. The child’s mother has also asked us to continue to speak with other parents about the importance of safe driving,” Bolton said.  School crisis intervention teams are available to assist students, parents, and school personnel, in addition to outside resources, and the superintendent urged students or families to contact their child’s school counselor or the main district offices for additional support. A district spokesman added that the statement from Bolton would be the only comment from the district.  Allentown Road was closed between Lower Road and Banbury Road with the assistance of the Harleysville Fire Police until 1:50 a.m. Thursday.

CeFaan Kim has more.  SPRINGFIELD GARDENS, Queens (WABC) -- A 14-year-old girl was killed after being ejected from a car as it slammed into the back of a parked UPS truck in Queens.  Police are investigating why a 16-year-old boy was behind the wheel with another minor. The NYPD says he was driving with a Learner's Permit and speeding.  ""As a mother, a mother don't want to go through this. I found her bracelet I can't sleep. I come to get her. I come to get my daughter,"" said Keisha Francis, the victim's mother.  Francis searched desperately through the broken glass Thursday morning for something, anything that would remind her of her 14-year-old daughter, Fortune Williams.  A bracelet was all that was left after the deadly crash.  ""I have three children and she showed me more love than anything else. At night I have to cuddle with Fortune, I couldn't sleep last night. I can't live without my daughter,"" Francis said.  At a vigil on Thursday night, Francis and the victim's aunt were unable to withstand the weight of the excruciating pain.  So many loved ones turned out that the NYPD had to show up to control traffic, with a sea of purple spilling into the street.  Before police arrived, you could hear the sound of speeding vehicles drown out the sound of a mother's anguish.  Fortune was a passenger in the red BMW. Eyewitness News has obtained video but stopped it before it shows the car barreling into the back of a parked UPS truck.  The impact knocked the delivery driver to the ground.  ""The car was coming basically maybe 90-100 mph,"" a witness said.  An eyewitness says the 16-year-old driver of the BMW was tailing a tractor-trailer on North Conduit Avenue Wednesday around 6:45 p.m. when he tried to switch lanes and lost control.  Police, who set up a speed trap a day later, say the teen driver was going at high rate of speed.  The driver survived but Fortune was thrown from the BMW upon impact. She was a student at Springfield Gardens high school and interested in the medical field.  Her life was cut far too short, leaving her mother forever with a void.  ""My life will never be the same without Fortune. Fortune is a sweetheart. She's a loving, caring child,"" Francis said.  Her mother says she was working a double shift the night of this tragedy. Fortune was home with her older sister, but went outside to hang out in her friend's car. Sadly, she never came home.  The 16-year-old driver of the car was taken to Cohen Children's Medical Center where he is stable.

"accident","2023-07-08","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 10:17:54","Dramatic twists and turns and a series of accusations adding more suspense to the unfortunate death of Sub-Inspector (SI) Junmoni Rabha, who lost her life in a fatal road accident on Monday night.  The latest whistle comes from Junmoni’s mother where she has accused the top brass of Nagaon police of “murdering” her daughter as the latter ferreted out their plans of a possible criminal conspiracy.  “The SP and DSP….all are involved in something big and Junmoni might have come to know about their malicious intentions, that is why they killed her!,” Junmoni’s weeping mother said.  She also claimed that the team of police led by Nagaon SP had raided her residence on an ill-fated night and seized more than Rs 1 lakh, apart from a small amount of jewelry. During the raid, she said that a police official allegedly seized her phone and switched it off before deleting several contacts and phone numbers from it.  The police had also threatened her to not speak anything in front of the media, Junmoni’s mother further claimed.  The raid, it’s now said, was conducted on the basis of a complaint lodged against Junmoni at Lakhimpur Police Station in which she has been accused of being involved in an extortion case.  She informed that the police team had arrived at her residence late at night, possibly after the tragic car crash that claimed Junmoni’s life.  Further, Junmoni’s mother claimed that the post-mortem of the deceased cop was carried out without her consent. This raises suspicion as Junmoni’s body had several injury marks indicating that she was assaulted with sticks or rods before her untimely death, her mother said.  In light of such anomalies, the family of the deceased cop has now sought the intervention of Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma into what is being described as a case of ‘premeditated murder’.  Earlier, an informant of SI Junmoni, Hasina Begum, who provided information against a fake gold nexus to her, also claimed that the accident was a premeditated murder. She has bought in serious allegations against the police asserting that Junmoni Rabha was innocent and that the case lodged against her was baseless.  “She has been killed and that the IC of Naoboicha police out post Sanjib Bora, is involved in the whole incident since he had demanded Rs 6 lakh from Junmoni Rabha to settle the police complaint lodged against her by an arrested accused of the fake gold case,” Hasina Begum told News Live.  Junmoni Rabha, who was embroiled in various controversies last year, died in a road accident at Kaliabor in Assam’s Nagaon district on Monday night. The vehicle in which Rabha was travelling in, reportedly collided with an oncoming container truck bearing registration number ‘UP 78UT 4518’ near Sarubhagia village on National Highway 37. Sources said that the vehicle was completely crushed in the accident as the impact was huge.  Rabha was a SI at Morakolong police station in Nagaon who made headlines last year for various controversies she was embroiled in – including corruption, criminal conspiracy, and cheating, for which was also arrested. She was later granted bail by a session’s court.  Junmoni’s death has raised several questions of whether it was murder, suicide or just an accident that turned fatal. Due to this, Director General of Police (DGP) GP Singh handed over the case to CID.  According to DGP Singh, a case was registered against Junmoni Rabha at the North Lakhimpur Police Station on May 15, a day before her death where she was named as an accused. Both the cases including the FIR lodged against Rabha and her tragic death will now be investigated by the CID, informed GP Singh.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c2xpdmV0di5jb20vbmVpdGhlci1hbi1hY2NpZGVudC1ub3ItYS1zdWljaWRlLWp1bm1vbmktcmFiaGEtd2FzLW11cmRlcmVkLWNsYWltcy1wb2xpY2UtaW5mb3JtYW50LWhhc2luYS1iZWd1bS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The victim's mother, Jessica Weaver, has condemned what she described as the inadequate response of the park lifeguards, claiming that their lack of preparation is partially to blame for the tragedy.  Trigger warning: This article concerns the accidental death of a child, the reader's discretion is advised  The Camp Cohen Water Park is managed by the City of El Paso, according to The El Paso Times. City officials have refused to comment on the death of Anthony Malave, stating that the case is currently under investigation. The Camp Cohen Water Park, one of the city's four water parks, was initially opened in 2021. It was closed for an undisclosed period before May 13. The day of the tragedy was labeled a ""soft opening"" event.  Anthony Malave's funeral took place on May 15, 2023  As reported by CBS, on Saturday, Jessica Weaver attended the soft opening of Camp Cohen with Anthony Malave. Weaver told reporters that the accident occurred at approximately 5 pm when Malave was found unresponsive in a pool. Fox noted that the EMS was called at 5:09 pm and arrived at 5:14 pm.  Jessica Weaver said that upon their arrival, first responders attempted to use CPR equipment on Anthony Malave. However, they faced technical difficulties. Weaver claimed that it was clear the lifeguards were not well trained.  Weaver said:  “They weren’t ready to switch out equipment if one wasn’t working properly for this child, they didn’t know do hands on mouth to mouth CPR, they didn’t even say hey this isn’t working, let’s do this, it was like let’s keep going with what we have and see the outcome.""  She continued:  “They kept saying the same thing that it’s not sealing properly around his mouth so he’s not getting the oxygen he needed, but never was there a switch of hey we got another one, here’s another piece of equipment, here let’s try this, it was just traumatizing to watch. ""  Jessica Weaver told CBS reporters that she does not blame the lifeguards but hopes that the city will provide them with adequate training in the future. She added that many of the lifeguards were young, describing them as ""children saving children.""

But I’m glad people are calling out the mom for her lack of reaction/concern for it.  In order to stop further drownings at the city's water parks, Jessica Weaver told reporters from various media sites that she is committed to speaking out against the inadequate safety responses. In a message delivered during an ABC 7 interview, she reminded parents to keep an eye on their children at the pool and to make sure that they were wearing floating devices.  The funeral of Anthony Malave was held on May 15, 2023. His obituary stated that he left behind a mother and a pair of grandparents.  Drowning rates in America  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are approximately 4000 fatal unintentional drownings in America a year and 8000 nonfatal drownings. The Red Cross noted that around 10 people die from drowning in America each day.  Studies show that for children between the ages of 1 and 4, drowning is the most common cause of death. US government sites state that to prevent drowning, parents should closely supervise children who are in the pool and implement a buddy system so that swimmers can look after one another in case of an emergency.

The iCarly actress was on tour for her debut album, Sparks Fly, in August of that year when her tour bus crashed into a semi-truck en route to Kansas. As per research done on internet trends, several netizens are once again taking keen interest in the actress' older accident.  This could be because a video of the actress narrating the accident has gone viral on TikTok, racking up over 142 thousand views and counting.  The TikTok clip of Cosgrove talking about the accident has amassed over 100,000 views (Image via TikTok/@mirandacosgroveupdates)  Miranda Cosgrove's tour bus smashed into a semi-truck en route to Kansas  Miranda Cosgrove was at the peak of her popularity in 2011.  Nickelodeon's iCarly was running successfully, the star had just released her debut album, Sparks Fly, and she toured the United States for her debut solo tour, The Dancing Crazy Tour.  Once Cosgrove released her second LP, High Maintenance, she decided to extend the Dancing Crazy tour into the summer.  cosgrover forever @king_cosgrover    #Cosgroversnation  #Mirandaourqueen  #generationcosgrovers  #Cosgoversreligion The best tour of the world Dancing crazy tour, @mirandacosgrove is the best. she make proyects so greats, so wonderful, she is the best.

A pity of that accident, that driver was so stupid#Cosgroversnation #Mirandaourqueen#generationcosgrovers#Cosgoversreligion https://t.co/GQYISKpW8Z  It was during the extended, Dancing Crazy Summer Tour that Miranda Cosgrove's tour bus smashed into a semi-truck in Illinois. The actress was en route to Kansas after a concert at the Fraze. Instead of swerving to avoid the semi, the tour bus driver hit the brakes, which resulted in the accident.  The accident left the actress and singer with a broken ankle that required surgery. Her mother also suffered concussions. The bus driver was severely injured and had to be airlifted to the hospital. Reports indicate that his arm was sliced right through and required 45 stitches.  ""I like, flew out of the bed and I hit the wall"": Miranda Cosgrove  The viral clip originated from EP #31 of Whitney Cummings' Good For You Podcast, where Miranda Cosgrove appeared as a guest. The actress labeled her accident as a ""Crazy weird thing that happened"" and explained that getting into a car accident was now a big fear of hers:  ""Especially if you're sleeping in a car or for a while after it happened, I would like, wake up in the night because I'd like, remember because I heard a big sound when the tour bus ran into another car.""  Miranda Cosgrove subsequently elaborated on how wearing UGG boots protected her leg from further damage:  ""I like, flew out of the bed and I hit the wall, so my foot like, hit the wall and the UGGs protected it.""  Miranda also had a funny story about her involvement in her mom's concussion. In the accident, a bookcase fell on top of the actress, and she disorientedly threw it off of her, only for it to inadvertently land on her mother. Her mother later suffered a concussion and was knocked out for the entire ordeal.  Miranda Cosgrove's surgeon was clueless about a hole in her foot  In October 2021, the actress appeared in actor Sean Hayes' and Dr. Priyanka Wali's podcast, Hypocondriactor, where she spoke about the extent of her injuries. Cosgrove remembered being relatively calm after the accident after being ensured that her injuries were treatable:  ""I wasn't really freaking out that much I don't know if it's just, you know, what people do when something traumatic happens you're kind of calm for once.""  When the then 20-year-old woke up after the surgery and got rid of her cast, she recalled seeing a hole between her ankle and her knee. She likened its size to that of the top of an expo marker. She said that it eventually healed, but at the time, it looked like someone cut a hole through her foot.  Dr. Priyanka Wali presented a few possibilities for the presence of the hole. Her first guess was that it was related to the insertion of a surgical rod at the time of the operation, but she acknowledged that if that were true, the doctors would know. Cosgrave explained that the medical staff were clueless about what it was:  ""The surgeon was like..., I wasn't in there when that happened, if we had something to do with it, I wasn't in, there. It must've been after I left the room.""  The only answer she got was from her physical therapist, who clarified that sometimes during surgery, it was necessary to make a hole to drain excess blood that flows toward the foot. Dr. Wali said she wasn't familiar with the process but wouldn't rule that out.

What You Need To Know Researchers at North Carolina State University developed a complex model to improve how quickly first responders get to car accidents    In computational testing, the model outperformed the existing techniques    This research can help agencies for long-term planning and on a day-to-day basis  Asya Atik and Dr. Leila Hajibabi are hoping their research will improve how quickly first responders, like police and EMTs, can respond to a car accident.  They developed a model that can help authorities figure out where to put first responder infrastructure, and determine which responders are best placed to reach an accident quicker.  The Ph.D. candidate, Atik, said she really wanted to work on something that would make a difference in the community.  “I personally am educated on optimization and engineering tools,” Atik said. “I’m also getting my Ph.D. in transportation systems, so I was looking into emergency response type of fields. I also want to work on something that I know has a value that will help people.”  Atik said during their research, they looked at statistics in the United States and realized quickly there were a lot of traffic accidents happening nationwide. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, more than five million traffic accidents were reported by police in the United States in 2020; and these accidents led to over 38,000 lives lost.  “It’s important to save lives and of course if there is an accident on the road, you clear the roadway from the accident as quickly as possible to make sure you’re avoiding secondary accounts and maintaining the safety on the roadways,” Hajibabi, assistant professor at NCSU, said.  Through their research, they said shorter response times could help avoid some of these impacts. Using real world data, they developed a model that maximizes the coverage area and minimizes the amount of time it would take to reach accident sites. They factored in things like fleet size, resources available to first responders and dispatching locations.  They said their model did better than existing models in terms of improving response times, regardless of the size of the traffic problem they were responding to. They’re hoping that this work helps inform agencies to make decisions when responding to these emergencies.  To test the model, researchers used data collected by the North Carolina Department of Transportation looking at more than 10,000 traffic incidents that happened in over 10,000 different location in Raleigh.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vc3BlY3RydW1sb2NhbG5ld3MuY29tL25jL2NoYXJsb3R0ZS9uZXdzLzIwMjMvMDUvMTcvbmV3LW1vZGVsLXRvLWhlbHAtZmlyc3QtcmVzcG9uZGVyc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Britain's Princess Diana(AP/ File photo)  On her last day, Princess Diana was with her partner at the time, 42-year-old Dodi Fayed, a film producer and son of billionaire Harrod's owner Mohamed Al Fayed, as Christopher Andersen recounted in the book “The Day Diana Died.”  The couple had come to Paris from Sardinia on August 30, 1997, after spending more than a week together around the Mediterranean. When they left Dodi Fayed’s Paris apartment in a Mercedes-Benz driven by Henri Paul- deputy head of security at the Ritz- they were accompanied by bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones.  When their car entered the Pont de L’Alma tunnel, Paul lost control of the vehicle after which the vehicle collided into the tunnel’s 13th pillar, resulting in a devastating collision that killed both Paul and Dodi Fayed at the scene.  Princess Diana remained alive as first responders arrived on the scene of the crash.  “We took her out of a car, put her on a stretcher, and at that moment the doctor said she was in cardiac arrest. So we gave her CPR, and after 20 seconds she regained consciousness and we transferred her to the ambulance,"" a first responder had then said as per Associated Press.  The car crash occurred as per royal expert Christopher Anderson owing to a number of photographers pursuing the Mercedes-Benz on motorcycles. After chasing after the car, the paparazzi reportedly remained at the scene of the accident, photographing Diana in her final moments.  “I think one of the hardest things to come to terms with is the fact that the people that chased her into the tunnel were the same people that were taking photographs of her while she was still dying on the back seat of the car,” Prince Harry told BBC.  “William and I know that. We’ve been told that numerous times by people that know that was the case,"" he added.  “Those people that caused the accident, instead of helping, were taking photographs of her dying,” he asserted.

Andhure said a major accident was averted as he was driving at a moderate speed.“The incident happened when some of the passengers were about to deboard at Shevalwadi. I was driving at moderate speed and slowed down further as some passengers were waiting to get off. The passengers had asked me stop a little fruther from the designated spot. I looked in the rear-view mirror only to find a rear wheel was about to come off. I slowed down further just before two wheels came off. I somehow stopped it a at a safe point before asking all passengers to get off. My habit of driving at moderate speeds paid off,” Andhure, who is currently posted in Parel depot and has been a MSRTC employee for the past 10 years, told TOI.Commuters have been up in arms against the state transport utility over faulty vehicles leaving its management in damage control mode. However, Shekhar Channe, the vice chairman and managing director of MSRTC called the incident a minor one. “In Mumbai, no buses are allowed to ply after they have operated for eight years. It was not an old bus. There has been a lapse in the maintained or spare parts are faulty. We are investigating the matter. It is unusual for wheels to come off the bus,” he said.Vipul Jain, a regular MSRTC commuter, said that travelling in the buses has become scary. “The Shivshahi buses are in a shambles and other buses have serious faults. Most drivers are rash leading to accidents. The assurance that MSRTC buses will provide safe rides, is long gone, hence people tend to spend more money and opt for private buses,” he said.Meanwhile, the MSRTC will start operations of five Shivai e-buses between Pune and Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar from Thursday.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2NpdHkvcHVuZS9idXMtd2hlZWxzLWNvbWUtb2ZmLWRyaXZlci1hdmVydHMtYWNjaWRlbnQvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvMTAwMzE3MjQyLmNtc9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vbS50aW1lc29maW5kaWEuY29tL2NpdHkvcHVuZS9idXMtd2hlZWxzLWNvbWUtb2ZmLWRyaXZlci1hdmVydHMtYWNjaWRlbnQvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93LzEwMDMxNzI0Mi5jbXM?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

An MRT train then collided with the crane jib, resulting in one death and 10 injuries.  This accident has caused great public concern. While a preliminary investigation is under way, the Taichung City Government has ordered that work be suspended on nine construction projects, including the one on which the crane was working, run by Highwealth Construction Corp. The city is also investigating the construction companies involved.  The domino theory of accident causation proposed by US industrial safety pioneer Herbert Heinrich says that accidents are often the result of a domino-like series of faults, in which one act of negligence causes more dominoes to fall, eventually causing an accident to occur.  Three such dominos can be seen in last week’s accident, namely failures in the construction company’s outsourcing management, human operations and the Taichung MRT’s emergency response system.  First, the construction firm failed to provide adequate safety measures to ensure the safety of its workers and nearby pedestrians. Second, there was carelessness on the part of the workers. Third, Taichung Mass Rapid Transit Corp’s emergency response system failed to promptly detect and respond to the danger, thus acting as the final domino.  To prevent similar accidents from happening again, the government should implement the following suggestions.  First, bolster its supervision of the construction industry to ensure that construction firms abide by safety regulations and provide adequate safety measures.  Second, enhance workers’ awareness of industrial safety and strictly supervise their operation of machinery.  Third, increase supervision of rapid transit companies to ensure that they effectively inspect, maintain and repair their emergency response systems to ensure passenger safety.  With regard to preventing accidents in the construction industry, the government should respond with measures that go to the source of the problem. The government and relevant departments should bolster their supervision of the construction industry and enforcement of related laws, requiring construction companies and their contractors to strictly abide by regulations to ensure the safety of workers and the surrounding environment.  The government must also increase its supervision of rapid transport companies, requiring them to ensure passenger safety by properly inspecting and maintaining their emergency response systems.  In addition to government supervision, all parties involved in the construction industry must conscientiously perform their duties with regard to safety management by giving their workers a safe working environment and equipment, and ensuring that their employees are properly trained and aware of safety rules.  As for the workers themselves, they must also consciously abide by safety regulations and operating procedures, thus ensuring their own safety and the safety of others.  Accidents in the construction industry have an immeasurable effect on society. The government must protect the health and safety of workers and the public by uncovering the root causes of accidents.  Only in this way can the construction industry continue to develop and make greater social and economic contributions.  Jean Liu is a podcast executive producer.

Distressing: Vicki Gunvalson's daughter Briana Culberson and her husband Ryan revealed that one of their four children 'suffered a terrible accident on Mother's Day'  Scary weekend: On Tuesday evening, the licensed practical nurse, 36, and spouse, who retired from the Marine Corps for medical reasons in 2017, shared that their child, who had been hospitalized with serious injuries' over the weekend, was 'doing well and home now'  Gunvalson has not publicly commented on her grandson's injuries, but did share a card from four of her grandchildren, who she said she missed 'terribly.'  In March, the family moved from to Oklahoma from their home of several years in Illinois to raise their little ones in a 'slower paced country setting.'  In April, when praised for 'present and appreciative' she is with her brood in the comment section of one of her Instagram posts, Briana said she and Ryan had 'through a lot, together and individually.'  'We’ve had a lot of things happen that have made us evaluate what’s important to us and how we want to raise our kids. It hasn’t always been pretty but we’ve gotten to such a place of peace with our marriage and we changed our whole lives for our kids,' she explained of her priorities.  As for how they were enjoying their new residence, nestled between farms with horses and a treehouse in their backyard, the mother-of-three said the new setting has been 'so peaceful' and they were all 'loving it.'

Prior to living in Oklahoma and Illinois, they previously resided in North Carolina for years.  Earlier this month, she opened up about knowing since she was 'old enough to remember' that she 'wanted to be a nurse.'  'My mom had health problems and many surgeries when I was a child. I always felt comfortable at the hospitals and taking care of her at home. That was easy, I knew I wanted to help people and it is the purpose for my life.

Beloved grandma: Gunvalson has not publicly commented on her grandson's injuries, but did share a card from four of her grandchildren, who she said she missed 'terribly'  Back in 2017, Briana was left 'fighting for her life' after surgeons made a mistake and operated on her with a dirty scalpel while performing a surgery to treat her lupus.  'It almost killed my daughter,' Vicki told People, at the time. '[The scalpel was infected] with feces from a previous surgery that day they put inside her body.'  The reality star stressed: ''So, not good, she almost lost her leg. She almost died and all this stuff.'

It’s the latest incident that has city officials looking for ways to prevent more vehicle fatalities from happening at the same location.  Loop 20 is a busy road that gets drivers from one end of Laredo to another but over the years, it has become a hot spot for some of the deadliest car accidents.  From motorcyclists crashing into a ditch to most recently a rollover that claimed the life of a 22-year-old.  With so many accidents happening back-to-back, District Six councilmember Dr. Tyler king believes now is the time to act.  “I asked for a long-term plan to address this, and with city and traffic and police there’s a two prone approach that you got to fix an issue, but you also have to fix the speeding as well,” said Dr. King.  According to Dr. King the plan is a two-phase approach.  “Create a concrete barrier to replace those flimsy poles that do little to nothing, from International to approximately Shiloh. On top of that, an unofficial plan from TxDOT at this time is to narrow the loop in that eastward-eastbound section to a two lane around that shortest curve,” said Dr. King.  It is the councilmember’s hope that these measures could help reduce the number of accidents in the area.  Now, as an added layer of protection, Investigator Joe Baeza with the Laredo Police Deparment said they have increased police presence following the recent accidents.  “I think what people do really need to know is that what they need to realize is that we augmented the enforcement of the area quite a bit,” said Baeza.  Baeza adds that the issue also requires the help of the community.  “They have to do their part, if everybody were to travel the posting speed limit its almost very hard to get into any kind of trouble,” said Baeza.  So the next time you drive through Loop 20, officials encourage you to remain alert and follow the speed limit so that you get home to your loved ones safe and sound.  According to TxDOT, the concrete barrier installation project will begin in 2024.  For more headlines. click here.  Copyright 2023 KGNS.

According to Cena, 46, the opportunity to be in the highly anticipated film came in the form of a chance encounter with “Barbie” actress Margot Robbie, 32, who was filming her movie across the street from his latest “Fast & Furious” installment.  “It was a happy accident, and I think ‘Barbie’ and ‘Fast X’ share a lot of parallels,” Cena said during the “Today” interview. “Their cast list is amazing. The ‘Barbie’ cast list is amazing. The ‘Fast X’ cast list is amazing. It was a chance maybe to [say], ‘Hey, would you guys be willing to have me if I could do something?’ “  “Fast X” star John Cena said that he told “Barbie” lead Margot Robbie he “would do, pretty much, whatever you guys need” to land a part in the movie. TODAY with Hoda & Jenna  Cena said that he told Robbie he “would do, pretty much, whatever you guys need ’cause I really enjoy the movie.”  Fortunately for the athlete, his “Suicide Squad” co-star made “a lot of the decisions” regarding casting and was later asked if he would be a merman.

[It’s] a very interesting take on everything but I was super lucky and it’s tremendously surreal.”  The “Playing with Fire” star revealed last week that his official audition for the summer flick initially did not go well.  “I tried and got rejected,” Cena said on SiriusXM’s “Pop Culture Spotlight” with Jessica Shaw. “They were putting out open casting for the movie. I get it, I wasn’t a piece for the puzzle.”  “Barbie” is set to party its way into theaters July 21. ©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection  “I think a lot of times people think, ‘Oh, he wouldn’t do that,’ ” continued Cena. “I don’t think there are any small parts. A chance is a chance. An opportunity to show your skill or develop a new skill, that’s fantastic. That’s why I want to do all this stuff, so I think once they realized I would just be grateful to be involved, they were like, ‘Yeah, you can do this.’ “  Cena will flip his fin alongside pop star Dua Lipa who was revealed to be playing the mermaid version of the popular Mattel doll.

Then suddenly, the car collides with a group of people trying to cross the road, and the victims are seen immediately flown across the road. A loud screeching of a female is heard.

(KCAU) — A woman was taken to a hospital with serious injuries after what officials are calling a “freak accident” on Tuesday.  At 4:55 p.m. officials were called to investigate a crash on Highway 24, according to a release from the Stanton County Sheriff’s office.  The release states that the investigation found that a 77-year-old woman was traveling west on Highway 24 when the driver’s side door to her van partially opened. Officials believe the driver was trying to close the door when she lost control of the vehicle.  The van then crossed over the eastbound lane before entering the south ditch while at highway speeds. The release states the woman fell through the open door while the vehicle continued moving through a grove of trees and fence line. The car finally came to a stop in a farm field.  Officials arrived on the scene to find the woman unconscious. She was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment of her injuries. She was allegedly not wearing her seatbelt at the time of the crash, according to the release.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpb3V4bGFuZHByb3VkLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3Mvd29tYW4tc2VyaW91c2x5LWluanVyZWQtaW4tZnJlYWstYWNjaWRlbnQtbmVhci1zdGFudG9uLXNoZXJpZmYtc2F5cy_SAXdodHRwczovL3d3dy5zaW91eGxhbmRwcm91ZC5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL3dvbWFuLXNlcmlvdXNseS1pbmp1cmVkLWluLWZyZWFrLWFjY2lkZW50LW5lYXItc3RhbnRvbi1zaGVyaWZmLXNheXMvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Online court documents show 29-year-old Casey Herwig of Cherokee, Iowa is facing one charge of knowingly leaving the scene of an accident resulting in death. The charge comes from an incident that happened in Cherokee back on Dec. 26, 2022.  Authorities say at about 8:30 p.m. they received a call about a bicyclist laying in the roadway at the intersection of N 6th Street and West Willow.  An investigation determined Herwig was the one who hit the bicyclist while driving a pickup. When authorities found Herwig’s pickup, they allegedly found damage on the front of the vehicle that matched parts found at the scene of the accident.  According to court documents, Herwig told officers that he knew he hit something, but he wasn’t sure what it was. When asked by officers if it was possible he hit a person, Herwig reportedly said that it “could’ve been.”  Documents identify the bicyclist as Phillip Watterson, a resident of Cherokee.

(WXIX) - The family of a Northern Kentucky man is in despair after their loved one was removed from life support three months after a tragic farm accident.  Larry Posey, 74, passed on Mother’s Day from injuries he suffered after he was run over by a tractor while working on a farm along Duncan Road in Crittenden.  “I’m dead inside,” said Tracey Deleon, Posey’s daughter. “I’m dying right now. It’s like, killing me.”  Deleon is in gut-wrenching pain without her father.  “Every night I’m on my back porch, sitting away from the kids so they don’t see the emotions, until 3 a.m. I’m crying out on the porch by myself,” Deleon said.  The accident happened on Feb. 13 as Posey was helping a friend repair a tractor on the farm he owns. Deleon says later that evening, they got the call.  “There were a couple of different stories. First, it was told that once the filter was put on, the tractor jumped out of gear and ran over him,” she said “Then another story was told that he was under it... We’re not sure exactly which of those stories is the truth.”  UC Air Care flew her father to the University of Cincinnati Medical Center with a fractured skull, fractured ribs and a punctured lung. He was placed on life support and eventually transferred to The Christ Hospital, where he would die three months later.  “With him gone, that leaves us with nothing,” Deleon said. “I call his cell phone just to hear his voice on his voicemail. I’m lost.”  She says the work her father was doing that day was typical of the man renowned locally as a handyman who didn’t mind getting his hands dirty and bending over backward for those who needed him.  “He would come up and help on the farm to not be sitting,” she said. “He would cut the grass, he would take care of the cows, and he would take care of the horses... He was a great person. The best.”  Deleon says Posey was a retired coal miner and a major financial provider for the family. Now she’s hopeful an online fundraiser created in his honor will raise enough to cover his funeral expenses.  “My dad was amazing. He was amazing. He taught me everything I need to know about car work. He was always there for me. Always there for me,” she said “He deserves to be buried with dignity and respect. No matter what I have to do.”  The family is working with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to determine what exactly happened.  See a spelling or grammar error in our story?

The said road is known often called ‘killer road’ due to its poor condition, particularly within the limits of the Municipal Councils of Mandi Gobindgarh and Amloh.  The road has been playing havoc with the lives of the public and accidents here have become a routine.  The deceased has been identified as Jaswinder Singh of Shanti Nagar. He was working as a peon at the Motia Khan branch of Union Bank. As per the police, the deceased was returning home after duty. As he reached near a restaurant on the Amloh road, a speeding truck hit his scooter. Jaswinder fell on the ground and was crushed by the truck. He died on the spot.  The Mandi Gobindgarh-Nabha road, which connects the area with Sangrur and Malwa, has been in a poor condition since long. Potholes and plying of trucks loaded with heavy iron material on the road not only cause great inconvenience to the commuters but also poses a threat to their lives. Trucks loaded with iron often overturn due to the potholes.  Harpreet Singh Prince, president of the Mandi Gobindgarh Municipal Council said earlier there was a toll plaza on the road, but the contractor shut it and left the road at the mercy of the authorities. Since then, neither the municipal councils nor the government initiated the repair work of the road, he said.  During the Assembly elections, the sitting AAP MLA had promised that it would be his priority to get the road repaired if his party came to power. But nothing has been done so far even though the party has completed more than one year in power.  The condition of the road worsened after it was dug up for laying sewerage lines. Trucks carrying iron material are parked on the roadside, leading to snarl-ups and causing accidents.  The residents have been demanding the repairing of the road for long, but no one has paid any heed to their demands.

(WIAT) — On Wednesday, UAB honored trauma survivors, their families and the doctors that treated them.  Wil Raines is a survivor who said he’s alive today and able to live out his dream of being a father because of the care from trauma specialists at UAB.  Raines is a familiar face here at CBS 42. As a photojournalist, he is an integral part of our team, capturing the heart of stories through the camera lens but it’s his heart that’s taking center stage.  Raines is a car accident survivor and thanks to doctors at UAB’s Trauma Center, he is able to share his story of survival.  “Going across four lanes of traffic changed the rest of my life,” Raines said.  It was the day after Christmas, 1997 when young Raines’ life flashed before his eyes.  “People at the Chevron said ‘Man, there was a bag that went flying out that car.’ [In reality] that was me,” Raines said.  He had hopped in his friend’s Bronco. They were meeting friends at the gas station down the street when they got in a car accident.  “I always wear my seatbelt. But you know, you jump in the car and run across the street, run a mile down the street go see a friend. You don’t think about it. I didn’t think about it,” Raines said.  A car crashed into them causing the Bronco to flip three times throwing Raines out of the car.  “Everything turned white, and it was completely quiet. Growing up as a person of faith I knew exactly what it was. I wasn’t scared,” Raines said.  The crash happened in Prattville, miles from UAB’s Trauma Center. He had a broken arm, collapsed lung and a stage-five laceration on his liver, causing him to bleed out.  “I saw my mom and my dad and the last thing I said to them for a few weeks was pray for me,” Raines said.  His family doctor, Dr. Charles Cloutier knew Raines’ chances of survival were running out. It was a cold, rainy December night and Cloutier said the medivac was grounded because of the weather. He pulled some strings and got an ambulance from Prattville to take Raines to Birmingham. He rode with him the entire way giving him blood and fluids along the way.  “We got him to UAB about 4 a.m. and UAB took over. They were professional, excellent. We felt very comfortable with Wil being here at UAB. It’s a time that’s embedded in your brain and will not go away. It was a traumatic event for everyone involved. Wil was a trooper,” Dr. Cloutier said.  Thankfully the surgeries were a success. It was the beginning of a long road to recovery. He had been given a second chance at life.  “If it weren’t for them, I wouldn’t have my son. If it weren’t for them, I wouldn’t be standing here talking to y’all,” Raines said.  And this Wednesday, Raines got to thank that doctor in person at UAB’s Trauma Survivors’ Day.  “I just want to give him a hug. I was talking to my mom, and I said what can I get him. He’s the one that saved my life,” Raines said.  Raines said it’s because of doctors like Dr. Cloutier and centers like UAB’s Trauma Center that so many people get to live a long and healthy life.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiczQyLmNvbS9uZXdzL2Nhci1hY2NpZGVudC1zdXJ2aXZvci1zaGFyZXMtc3RvcnktYXQtdWFicy10cmF1bWEtc3Vydml2b3JzLWRheS_SAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnM0Mi5jb20vbmV3cy9jYXItYWNjaWRlbnQtc3Vydml2b3Itc2hhcmVzLXN0b3J5LWF0LXVhYnMtdHJhdW1hLXN1cnZpdm9ycy1kYXkvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

On Friday, May 12, 30-year-old Scotty Hogg and his girlfriend 34-year-old Kaitlyn Brann were climbing Goodro’s Wall in Big Cottonwood Canyon when a large rock on the route gave way, causing both the climbers to fall. Brann was killed in the accident, and Hogg was transported to the hospital by helicopter with serious injuries.  The fundraiser was organized by Cory Lamkins, a friend of Hogg’s. Lamkins and Hogg met in 2017 while they were stationed in Iraq serving in the Army. Lamkins described Hogg as an avid outdoor enthusiast and a very dependable friend.  “He loves being outdoors and in nature,” Lamkins said. “If you call and you need something, he will help whether it’s in person or whether he spends all his days calling anybody he knows that can help you out closer to you. He’s always a guy that if you need him, he’s there.”  Although Lamkins had not met Brann in person, he said that he had spoken to her on the phone several times during calls with Hogg.  “I did not get to meet her in person, sadly, but I will say anybody that had the energy to love Scott must have been a pretty incredible person, because he’s all go all the time,” Lamkins said.  Hogg is still in the hospital where he is working with physical therapists to regain mobility after the accident.  “He’s got a long road ahead of him to fully recover,” Lamkins said. “Just like anybody who lost someone days ago, you know, he’s mentally going through your grinder, but all the love and support it’s really been helping him stay out of dark times.”  At the time of this article $9,030 had been donated out of the GoFundMe’s $20,000 goal. According to Lamkins, all donated funds that surpass the $20,000 goal will be donated to Brann’s family to help cover funeral expenses.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vdG93bmxpZnQuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvZnJpZW5kLW9mLW1hbi1pbmp1cmVkLWluLWNsaW1iaW5nLWFjY2lkZW50LWNyZWF0ZXMtZ29mdW5kbWUtdG8tY292ZXItbWVkaWNhbC1leHBlbnNlcy_SAXdodHRwczovL3Rvd25saWZ0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1L2ZyaWVuZC1vZi1tYW4taW5qdXJlZC1pbi1jbGltYmluZy1hY2NpZGVudC1jcmVhdGVzLWdvZnVuZG1lLXRvLWNvdmVyLW1lZGljYWwtZXhwZW5zZXMvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"accident","2019-12-05","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 13:05:48","Death Benefits Wrongfully Denied to Woman Whose Fiancé Died in Industrial Accident  A woman whose fiancé and father of her children died in an industrial accident was wrongfully denied death benefits solely because she was not his spouse, the Supreme Court of Ohio ruled today.  In a unanimous per curiam opinion, the Supreme Court ruled the Ohio Industrial Commission did not completely analyze the death benefits law, but instead focused only on whether Amanda Carpenter was Christopher McDonald’s wife. An unmarried person in a relationship with the deceased is not “presumed” to be entitled to death benefits under the law, but a case-by-case inquiry needs to be made under such circumstances.  The Court vacated the industrial commission’s order and directed it to determine if Carpenter is entitled to death benefits as a “member of McDonald’s family.”  Click to Expand  Benefit Denial Contested  In 2019, McDonald died in a ditch collapse. Carpenter, the mother of McDonald’s two minor children, applied to the Bureau of Workers’ Compensation for death benefits on behalf of the children and herself.  Carpenter identified herself as McDonald’s fiancée. She provided a sworn statement that she and McDonald had been in a relationship for 11 years and jointly owned property. The two were jointly responsible for mortgage and vehicle lease payments and credit card debts. Each had life insurance policies naming the other as the sole beneficiary. Carpenter indicated she worked part-time, and McDonald was the primary financial support for her and their two children. She added that they “had every intention of being married if not for this accident.”  A district hearing officer awarded benefits to the children, but not to Carpenter. She appealed and a staff hearing officer awarded her death benefits as well. The order was then appealed to the industrial commission, which vacated the decision of its staff hearing officer and denied Carpenter death benefits.  The commission determined Carpenter was not dependent on McDonald as a surviving spouse because they were never married and they could not be considered married under common law because Ohio abolished common-law marriage in 1991. The commission also stated that case law has not extended the benefit to “an unmarried person in a relationship” with the deceased, as Carpenter suggested.  Carpenter requested a writ of mandamus from the Tenth District Court of Appeals ordering the industrial commission to reverse its decision and award her death benefits. The Tenth District did so, and the industrial commission appealed the decision to the Supreme Court.  Supreme Court Analyzed Death Benefit Law  Payment of death benefits to the dependents of a worker who died on the job is governed by R.C. 4123.59(D), the opinion explained. The law explains that a surviving spouse living with the employee at the time of death is presumed to be wholly dependent on the deceased and entitled to death benefits.  The law says a “member of the family” may be a “prospective dependent” if the person also “bears to the deceased employee the relation of surviving spouse, lineal descendant, ancestor, or brother or sister.” The industrial commission may take any facts into consideration that indicate the person’s prospective dependency.  In all other cases, the commission must decide “in accordance with the facts in each particular case” if the person is “a member of the family of the deceased employee, or bears to the deceased employee the relation of surviving spouse, lineal descendant, ancestor, or brother or sister.”  The Court stated this last paragraph of the law applies to claims brought by a person not presumed to be a dependent of the employee, and may even apply to a surviving spouse if the spouse was not living with the employee at the time of death.  The opinion stated that the last paragraph of R.C. 4123.59(D) provides two potential categories of dependents. One is a member of the family of the deceased employee. The second is a person who “bears to the deceased employee the relation of surviving spouse, lineal descendant, ancestor, or brother or sister.” Because the sentence contains an “or,” a person does not have to be married to the deceased employee to be a member of the family, the Court ruled.  The law indicates “any” person may be eligible for benefits if that person is determined to be “a member of the family,” the opinion stated. Ohio workers’ compensation laws do not define “member of the family.” When denying Carpenter benefits, the commission did not consider or determine whether she was a member of McDonald’s family, the opinion stated.  The commission argued that for more than 80 years, the law in Ohio required a legal marriage before it was required to pay death benefits. The opinion noted the commission used cases from 1922 and 1957 to support its argument.  The Court pointed to more recent cases in which stepchildren who were not formally adopted, but lived with and were dependent on the deceased employee, were considered members of the family and were awarded death benefits.  The opinion stated the commission could consider that an unmarried person in a relationship with the deceased is a member of the family. The Court pointed to definitions in Black’s Law Dictionary that could include Carpenter. For instance, one definition of “family” in the law dictionary is “a group consisting of parents and their children,” the opinion noted. Another is “a group of people who live together and usu[ally] have a shared commitment to a domestic relationship.”  “Accordingly — as these definitions show — it is very well possible that Carpenter could qualify as a ‘member of the family of the deceased employee,’” the Court concluded. “Whether Carpenter actually qualifies as a ‘member of the family of the deceased employee’ under the particular facts of this case is a question that the commission will have to address.”  2022-0143.

A bracelet was all that was left after the deadly crash.  ""I have three children and she showed me more love than anything else. At night I have to cuddle with Fortune, I couldn't sleep last night. I can't live without my daughter,"" Francis said.  Fortune was a passenger in the red BMW. Eyewitness News has obtained video but stopped it before it shows the car barreling into the back of a parked UPS truck.  The impact knocked the delivery driver to the ground.  ""The car was coming basically maybe 90-100 mph,"" a witness said.  An eyewitness says the 16-year-old driver of the BMW was tailing a tractor-trailer on North Conduit Avenue Wednesday around 6:45 p.m. when he tried to switch lanes and lost control.  Police, who set up a speed trap a day later, say the teen driver was going at high rate of speed.  The driver survived but Fortune was thrown from the BMW upon impact. She was a student at Springfield Gardens high school and interested in the medical field.  Her life was cut far too short, leaving her mother forever with a void.  ""My life will never be the same without Fortune. Fortune is a sweetheart. She's a loving, caring child,"" Francis said.  Her mother says she was working a double shift the night of this tragedy. Fortune was home with her older sister, but went outside to hang out in her friend's car. Sadly, she never came home.  The 16-year-old driver of the car was taken to Cohen Children's Medical Center where he is stable.

"accident","2023-04-28","Not Discerned","{""FollyBeach"", ""SouthCarolina"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 21:24:03","The widower groom of the newlywed killed by an alleged drunk driver on Folly Beach April 28 has filed a wrongful death civil lawsuit. It claims the driver, Jamie Komoroski of James Island, had been “bar hopping” throughout the fateful day.  Charleston-based attorney Daniel Dalton of Mickelsen Dalton LLC is representing Aric Hutchinson, the groom who received multiple injuries in the golf cart-car accident that made national headlines.  Dalton  “This case is about keeping the public safe from drunk driving,” he said. “We’ve performed our own investigation into this matter. We’ve been cooperating with law enforcement however we can, and we felt confident enough to be ready to file the lawsuit based on what we’ve found out so far.”  The lawsuit follows a tragic accident in which the alleged drunk driver’s car collided with a golf cart transporting newlywed bride Samantha Miller and groom Hutchinson, as well as two others. The bride and groom had gotten married only hours earlier.  According to a news report, a lab report from the State Law Enforcement Division showed Komoroski had a blood-alcohol level of 0.26 at the time, more than three times over the legal limit.  Hutchinson is still physically recovering from injuries sustained in the crash, Dalton said. According to news reports, data retrieved from Komoroski’s rental car showed she was driving 65 mph, well over twice the speed limit.  Dalton said there are still facts and a lot of questions that hadn’t yet been answered.  “There are still many details we don’t know about the sequence of events leading up to the tragic crash,” Dalton said. “But by filing a lawsuit, we can begin the legal discovery process that allows us to get the answers that Samantha’s family deserves.”  According to the lawsuit, “Despite being noticeably and visibly intoxicated at each of these establishments, Jamie Komoroski continued to be served, provided, and/or allowed to consume alcohol in each of them.”  Dalton said video and photo evidence, as well as eyewitness testimony, were used in the investigation to ensure confidence in Komoroski’s level of intoxication described in the lawsuit.  Businesses named in the lawsuit were Beach Front Bars, Snapper Jacks, The Folly Beach Deli, The Drop In Bar & Deli, The Crab Shack, Folly Tacqueria, Taco Boy, El Gallo Bar and Grill, and Bottle Cap Management Group.  According to the lawsuit, these establishments “ … as licensed sellers of beer, wine and liquor for consumption pursuant to South Carolina law, had a duty to obey all laws and regulations regarding the sale of alcoholic beverages and exercise due care … not to allow patrons to become intoxicated, to not serve alcohol to intoxicated persons.”  The lawsuit also lists about 20 John and Jane Does representing owners, managers, operators, agents and more whose “negligence contributed to” Miller’s death.  The private investigation is ongoing, he said.  “We hope that the bars will cooperate with us and provide whatever they have,” Dalton said. “I would think given the tragic nature of this case that they would want to own up to whatever happened or didn’t happen … we’ve seen cooperation from some parties; others are tightening up a little bit.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vY2hhcmxlc3RvbmNpdHlwYXBlci5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8xNy93aWRvd2VyLW9mLWJyaWRlLWtpbGxlZC1pbi1mb2xseS1iZWFjaC1hY2NpZGVudC1maWxlcy1sYXdzdWl0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

On Wednesday, the operator of the company that rented out that vehicle — a 31-foot-long, five-ton 2001 Ford Excursion stretch limousine — was found guilty on 20 counts of second-degree manslaughter in the October 2018 accident.  The operator, Nauman Hussain, could face up to 15 years in prison when he is sentenced on May 31.  The verdict, announced to an emotionally charged courtroom and after less than a day of deliberation by a jury in Schoharie County, west of Albany, caps a nearly five-year ordeal for the families of the victims, which included all 17 passengers, the driver and two pedestrians outside a cafe and store in Schoharie, N.Y.

Uğur Karahanlı’s father and mother died shortly before first responders arrived on the scene, while his wife was seriously injured in the accident.  According to local reports, Karahanlı, a former teacher who was dismissed by a government decree as part of purges that followed a July 15, 2016 coup attempt, was in 2021 sentenced to six-and-a-half years in prison on conviction of alleged links to the movement.  Karahanlı had previously been jailed in a prison in southern Hatay province, one of the areas hardest hit by two powerful earthquakes in early February, after which he was transferred to the prison in central Turkey.  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has been targeting followers of the Gülen movement, inspired by Turkish Muslim cleric Fethullah Gülen, since the corruption investigations of December 17-25, 2013, which implicated then-prime minister Erdoğan, his family members and his inner circle.  Dismissing the investigations as a Gülenist coup and conspiracy against his government, Erdoğan designated the movement as a terrorist organization and began to target its members. He intensified the crackdown on the movement after the abortive putsch in 2016, which he accused Gülen of masterminding. Gülen and the movement strongly deny involvement in the coup attempt or any terrorist activity.  Following the failed coup, the Turkish government declared a state of emergency and carried out a massive purge of state institutions under the pretext of an anti-coup fight.  More than 130,000 public servants, including 4,156 judges and prosecutors, as well as 24,706 members of the armed forces were summarily removed from their jobs for alleged membership in or relationships with “terrorist organizations” by emergency decree-laws subject to neither judicial nor parliamentary scrutiny.  Former public servants were not only fired from their jobs; they were also banned from working again in the public sector and getting a passport. The government also made it difficult for them to work formally in the private sector. Notes were put on the social security database about dismissed public servants to deter potential employers, leading them to work in unskilled jobs with little workplace safety. There have been a number of cases in which former public servants died in occupational accidents.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vc3RvY2tob2xtY2Yub3JnLzItbWVtYmVycy1vZi1mYW1pbHkta2lsbGVkLWluLXRyYWZmaWMtYWNjaWRlbnQtd2hpbGUtZHJpdmluZy10by12aXNpdC1qYWlsZWQtcHVyZ2UtdmljdGltL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(Mainichi/Ryutaro Nishimoto)  MAEBASHI -- The parents of a 19-year-old university student who died in a recent rafting accident on the Tone River in Gunma Prefecture are seeking answers after he was found without a life jacket, and it emerged a guide on another boat had said the student's raft would capsize.  The victim, Keisuke Honda, had only just entered a national university in Tokyo, and on the day of the accident, he left his family home early in the morning. ""I had no idea that he was going rafting,"" his mother said. His father added, ""I thought he was going on a day trip with friends and that he would come back as normal.""  At around 6:45 p.m. on May 5, the parents received a call from Gunma Prefecture Police's Numata Police Station, informing them of the accident. They went by car to Gunma, arriving at about 9 p.m. It was dark and they couldn't see any rescue boats out.  ""Is no one looking for our son?"" they wondered in shock. The parents took out a flashlight they had bought on the way and made their way through the grass at the side of the river.  ""I thought that if he was in water as cold as this, I wanted to rescue him quickly,"" the father said. Multiple cuts ran up his arms, apparently made by the grass.  Son found with no life jacket  The teen's parents spent seven hours searching a roughly 1 kilometer stretch of the river starting from the accident site, but didn't find anything. Police resumed their search at 5 a.m. on May 6, and at 5:49 a.m. they found him about 300 meters downstream from the Suwakyo Bridge over the Tone River. The cause of death was drowning. He was not wearing a life jacket.  The parents met with officials from the rafting tour company at Numata Police Station on May 6, and spoke with them for about an hour. They asked about the situation at the time their son's raft capsized and about rescue efforts immediately afterward, but said they didn't receive a concrete explanation. ""They didn't tell us anything,"" the student's father recalled angrily.  Their distrust grew after they heard about conditions at the time of the accident from a man in another rafting boat, who took part in the same tour.  According to the man, the participants were in three boats, with two full of families with children, and a blue one carrying Honda and his friends. The man said that when he got into his boat, the guide said, ""That blue boat is going to capsize."" The other boats passed the accident site safely and then waited for the blue boat, and again the guide said that Honda's boat would capsize.  After the accident, the other two rafts were taken to the side of the river and the tour ended partway through. Participants were reportedly handed commemorative photos at this point, taken by a photographer who was following the boats in a vehicle along the river. The man said he wanted Honda's parents to know the river conditions at the time, and handed his photos to them, and also told them about what he saw.  Rocks and driftwood are seen scattered about at the scene of the accident as water splashes up, on the Tone River in Minakami, Gunma Prefecture, on May 9, 2023. (Mainichi/Ryutaro Nishimoto)  The photos showed Honda wearing a life jacket and a helmet, shoulder to shoulder with his friends, and showed him laughing as water splashed above the raft.  His mother said, ""It was a dangerous activity. He was suddenly thrown out into water chilly with snowmelt, and his life jacket was carried downstream, so he must have sunk into the water around where the boat capsized. The tour guide's rescue effort wasn't enough at all. I want the police to conduct a proper investigation.""  Operating company: 'A turn of events we can't take back'  The president of the company that organized the tour commented, ""I'm truly sorry that there has been a turn of events we can't take back. We will consider efforts to prevent a recurrence and think about how to atone for this.""  According to the president, participants sign consent forms acknowledging that if they fall out of the boat and stand up the current, their legs could get pinned against rocks and they could suffer broken bones or even drown. Verbal explanations were also given to make people aware of the risks.  On the possibility of a boat capsizing, the company president said, there were times when people played balancing games, standing on the edge of the boat and that the boats would sometimes capsize as a result. But people don't do that in the current season when there is a lot of water in the river and the temperature is cold.  Regarding the comment from the passenger on the other boat that their guide had said that the blue boat would capsize, the president said, ""When two boats have gone ahead and are waiting, we sometimes humorously explain that we will help the other one in such and such a way if they capsize.""  According to Outdoor Joint Association Minakami, an organization of Gunma Prefecture-based rafting companies, safety checks are conducted along the Tone River five times a year, and if tour guides find anything abnormal, they are required to quickly report it to the association. Each operator is also certified in whitewater rescue and first aid. Association director Mitsuyoshi Ishikawa commented, ""If something happens, we respond quickly. We've established fairly strict safety standards.""  A total of four people died in Tone River rafting accidents in Gunma Prefecture between 2000 and 2002 -- two male and one female passenger in their 20s and 30s and one male guide in his 20s.  Water safety group chairman: 'Wear your life jacket properly'  Hidetoshi Saito, chairman of the Society of Water Rescue and Survival Research and a graduate school professor at the Nagaoka University of Technology in Niigata Prefecture, commented, ""People need to be aware that boats can sink or capsize. That's not to say that we shouldn't get into them; rather I want people to wear life jackets properly so they can enjoy the ride.""  In the event of an accident such as a boat capsizing, it is important to float on the water to ensure one can breathe. According to Saito, life jackets can come off easily if only the zipper is closed, so the belt and buckle need to be fastened tighter than people might expect. He says that if the belt and buckle hadn't come undone, then the student may have slipped out of the life jacket, but if there were undone, then there is a possibility he either wasn't wearing it properly or had undone it himself before drowning. ""If he wasn't wearing it properly from the start then the operator would be held responsible,"" he said.

He loved the outdoors, hunting, John Deere, the smell of fresh country air, and taking great care of the land entrusted to him and the animals that dwelled it. He was our north, south, east and west. Our working week and Sunday rest. Scott was the friend we all needed and will be forever missed.""  The report also said:  He knew he was up in the silo shoveling sileage at 12:30 p.m. He went up to look for his brother and noticed the silage motor had fallen on his back.  When police arrived, the man was pronounced dead. It appeared the wire snapped, and the motor fell approximately 50 feet and pinned Tyrba.

Credit: JavierLJ/Shutterstock.com.  Chinese mining company Zijin Mining has reported a mining accident at one of its mines in Tibet, the circumstances of which have led to the stopping of production.  On 14 May, a lift cage fell during shaft construction in the drainage system at the Julong open-pit copper and polymetallic mine, cutting contact with six workers.  Zijin has suspended mining production at the site and launched search and rescue operations for the missing workers.  The company added that it has carried out an investigation and rectification of the hidden risks. The cause of the accident is still being investigated.  The construction of the Julong mine was subcontracted to Fujian Xingwanxiang Construction Group by Zijin subsidiary Tibet Julong Copper.  Zijin owns a 50.1% stake in the Julong mine, which produced 115,000 tonnes (t) of copper last year and is planning to increase its production to 152,000t this year.  Phase one production at Julong Copper began in December 2021. Located in the Tibetan plateau at an altitude between 4,000m and 5,000m, the mine features 10.7 million tonnes of copper and 570,000t of molybdenum.  Last month, the company through Barrick Gold, a joint venture with Barrick Niugini (BNL), entered a New Porgera Progress Agreement (NPPA) with the Papua New Guinea Government.  According to the NPPA, all three parties – Zijin, BNL and the Papua New Guinea Government – have agreed to reopen the Porgera Gold Mine at the earliest opportunity.  Operations at the mine were suspended in April 2020 due to the failure to secure approval for its extension. The NPPA signing is an important milestone in resuming operations.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbmluZy10ZWNobm9sb2d5LmNvbS9uZXdzL3ppamluLW1pbmluZy1zdG9wcy1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLXRpYmV0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"accident","2016-07-10","Not Discerned","{""Westfield"", ""Indiana"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 12:55:22","When you’ve been in a car accident, there is no doubt the situation can be incredibly stressful and overwhelming. After making sure everyone is safe and getting medical attention if necessary, many individuals find themselves wondering what else needs to be done or what rights they may have under the law.  To help sort out this legal process of a car accident case and know what information will be relevant during such proceedings, here are some key points to keep in mind for both women and men.  How to File a Claim After an Accident  Filing a claim after an accident can be a complicated and time-consuming process, but it is essential to ensure that you receive the compensation you deserve. Whether you were involved in a car accident, slip and fall, or any other type of incident, it’s crucial to seek legal advice right away to understand your rights and responsibilities.  You will need to gather evidence, such as photographs, witness statements, and medical records, to support your claim. It’s important to remember that insurance companies may try to offer you a settlement that is not in your best interest, so having an experienced attorney in your corner can help you navigate the claim process and negotiate a fair settlement. Don’t hesitate to reach out to a legal professional for assistance in filing your claim and protecting your rights.  Getting legal advice  The legal process for a car accident case can be complex, so it is always in your best interest to get legal advice as soon as possible. An experienced attorney will help you understand the laws that apply to your situation and provide sound legal advice on how to proceed with your claim. Whether you decide to get advice from youraccidentattorneys.com, or research to find a suitable attorney, make sure you are getting assistance from a qualified professional. When you are represented by a qualified attorney, you will be able to rest assured that your claim is in capable hands and that your rights are being appropriately protected.  Types of Damages You Can Seek in a Car Accident Case  In car accident cases, the types of damages that can be sought can vary greatly depending on the circumstances of the incident. The most common types of damages that plaintiffs may seek include compensation for medical expenses, lost wages, property damage, and pain and suffering.  However, there are other damages that may also be applicable, such as punitive damages, which are intended to punish a defendant for particularly egregious behavior. It is important to work with an experienced attorney who can guide you through the legal process and help you pursue the appropriate damages for your case. Don’t hesitate to seek legal advice if you’ve been involved in a car accident and believe you deserve compensation for any losses or injuries suffered.  Proving Fault in a Car Accident Case  When it comes to car accident cases, proving fault can be a complex process that often ends up in court. Legal professionals and insurance companies will examine a variety of factors, including police reports, witness statements, and medical evidence to determine who is at fault for the accident. It is important to remember that proving fault is not simply about assigning blame, but rather about providing justice and ensuring that the responsible party is held accountable for their actions. Therefore, if you are involved in a car accident, it is crucial to seek legal representation to ensure that your rights are upheld and the responsible party is brought to justice.  Common Defense Strategies Used in Car Accident Cases  When it comes to car accident cases, common defense strategies are often employed in an effort to minimize or eliminate liability. One such strategy involves arguing that the plaintiff was partially or completely at fault for the accident. Another common defense tactic is to challenge the plaintiff’s claims of injury or damages, often by questioning the severity of the injuries or the validity of the medical treatment received. Moreover, defendants may attempt to settle the case for a smaller amount by arguing that the plaintiff had pre-existing injuries or conditions that were aggravated by the accident. It is important to work with an experienced attorney who can help navigate these defense strategies and fight for your rights in court.  Timeline of the Legal Process for a Car Accident Case  When you’ve been in a car accident, the legal process can seem daunting and complicated. However, it’s important to understand the timeline of events that will unfold. The process typically begins with filing a claim with your insurance company, followed by an investigation into the accident and determining who is at fault.  From there, negotiations may take place to reach a settlement. If a settlement cannot be reached, the case will proceed to court where a judge or jury will ultimately determine the outcome. It’s important to have a knowledgeable and experienced legal team on your side to guide you through each step of the process and ensure that your rights are protected.  The legal process of a car accident case can be a painstaking one requiring effort from all parties involved in order to satisfactorily resolve the dispute. It is vital for those who are involved in an accident to understand their rights and the steps they can take toward seeking the damages they deserve. Knowing who is at fault for an accident, what types of damages you can recover, and having a timeline for the progression of your case will help ensure that proceedings move quickly and efficiently. With this knowledge in hand, each party can work together to ensure a swift resolution in their car accident case.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vc2ZsY24uY29tL3RoZS1sZWdhbC1wcm9jZXNzLW9mLWEtY2FyLWFjY2lkZW50LWNhc2Utd2hhdC15b3UtbmVlZC10by1rbm93L9IBUWh0dHBzOi8vc2ZsY24uY29tL3RoZS1sZWdhbC1wcm9jZXNzLW9mLWEtY2FyLWFjY2lkZW50LWNhc2Utd2hhdC15b3UtbmVlZC10by1rbm93Lw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

His death took Bermuda’s road fatality toll for 2023 to five.  In a social media post, the Bermuda Football Association (BFA) said it “joins the Warren and Bermuda football family in mourning the loss of a rising icon of the beautiful game, Marco Warren, who had his debut international cap for Bermuda in March 2015 against Nicaragua. The match resulted in a 2-0 victory for our Gombey Warriors.  “BFA extends its heartfelt condolences to Marco’s family, friends, teammates, and fans. Our logo will be displayed in black until Marco’s funeral”.  Warren’s club, the PHC Zebras, also paid tribute to him saying they will never forget the impact that their star player had on the team and Bermuda.  “Marco was more than just a player. He was a part of our family, embodied the Zebra spirit, and was the heart of our team. Marco continually left fans in awe of his skills and inspired other players to improve. He was a humble person despite his level of greatness. When he was on the field, the “magician” just went to work,” the club said.  “Marco was a loving father, son, brother, boyfriend, nephew, cousin, teammate, and true friend. He was a leader both on and off the field as he demonstrated the well-rounded individual we aspire to develop for our community. All who encountered him were impressed with his wisdom and kindness.”  Bermudian star and Bristol City player Nahki Wells also remembered his teammate on Instagram.

That said, this is when the evidence is at its best, so contact local law enforcement as soon as you’ve called for medical assistance. If your injuries are too severe to gather photographs and numbers, police presence at the scene will bolster your case.  An emergency room assessment is one of the most powerful things you can do to prove your damages. The sooner you see a doctor, the more convincing your evidence will be. Remember that personal injury cases draw more compensation when there’s solid diagnostic evidence, so X-rays and the like are key.  2) Gather Contact Information  Eyewitnesses disperse quickly. If your injuries aren’t life-threatening, exchanging information with everyone involved in the collision is essential. If there are eyewitnesses in sight, gather their contact details as well. You should also collect the insurance details of the at-fault party. While the police will gather their evidence, you should also take your photographs. If you see skid marks, car dents, or any other forms of damage, assume that an expert could use them to prove the cause of the accident. Make sure you snap the scene from different angles. You can’t take too many photographs, but you can certainly take too few.  3) Don’t Admit Guilt  Admitting guilt to eyewitnesses and at-fault parties can weaken your case, so avoid any comments that could be interpreted this way. Don’t apologize or express a sense of guilt. It’s also best to keep the experience off of social media. Tweets and blog posts can be used against you in court. It’s best to limit your communication to the absolute minimum lest you accidentally harm your chances in a personal injury trial.  4) Make Sure the Police Take Your Statement  Almost 40% of police reports don’t include a statement from the pedestrian, particularly if they’re sent to urgent care. The police must record your version of events. Your voice matters, so don’t be afraid to question the police report. This paperwork can be amended to reflect the situation more accurately. Call a lawyer if the officer refuses to take your statement or fix inaccuracies.  5) Start Making an Insurance Claim  Once you’ve dealt with the urgent aspects of your collision, it’s time to phone the driver’s insurance company to launch a claim. It’s best to limit your narrative to the essential facts, no matter how much they pressure you into providing more details. You’re not required to disclose facts about your medical care, police report, or partial fault.  6) Keep Track of Follow-Up Care  The more detailed your medical care is, the stronger your case will be, so go to all your recommended follow-up appointments. Request diagnostics if necessary. Keep an ongoing record of your medical bills and transportation costs. If you miss time off work, add your lost income to your records. These details will ultimately go to an insurer, but it’s best to seek legal advice before you hand them over.  Personal injury settlements can be difficult to secure without legal help. Insurers and at-fault parties are notorious for low-balling victims, but you can build a successful case with the right assistance. You need someone in your corner, no matter how strong or resourceful you are.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vdml2YWdsYW1tYWdhemluZS5jb20vaW5qdXJlZC1pbi1hLXBlZGVzdHJpYW4tYWNjaWRlbnQtNi1pbW1lZGlhdGUtc3RlcHMteW91LXNob3VsZG50LW1pc3Mv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The cast list is amazing, the Barbie cast list is amazing, the Fast X cast list is amazing,” he told Hoda Kotb during an interview on the NBC morning show. “So, with a lot of opportunity, it was a chance for maybe to [say], ‘Hey, would you guys be willing to have me if I could do something?'”  Cena told Kotb that he “kind of” pitched himself for the film “in an accidental run-in with Margot Robbie” where he said, “I would do, pretty much, whatever you guys need ’cause I really enjoy the movie and they asked me if I wanted to be a merman.”  The Peacemaker actor said that Fast X was filming across the street from where Barbie was filming.

State police said the bear was crossing the southbound lanes of I-85 about two miles north of the DeWitt exit when the driver of a sports-utility vehicle slammed on the brakes to avoid hitting it. Another SUV, however, was not so fortunate and wound up hitting both the bear and the back of the first SUV.  No one inside either vehicle was injured. Witnesses told state police the bear ran away from the scene.  Earlier Monday, Petersburg Police reported a bear sighting near the Henry William Townhouses at the intersection of Lee Avenue and South Street. Authorities were encouraging anyone who may see the bear not to approach it and instead call police at (804) 732-4222 or the Virginia Department of Games and Inland Fisheries at (804) 367-1000.  A Petersburg Police spokesperson told The Progress-Index no other sightings were reported in the city.  Black bears are a common sight anywhere in Virginia, according to the state Department of Wildlife Resources. While seen sporadically along the coast, a DWF map indicates these animals can be found most anywhere in the state because they adapt so easily to their surroundings.  “They prefer habitats that provide cover, such as a densely wooded mature oak forests or swampy area in the coastal plain, and easily accessible food resources,” the DWF website said.  The National Park Service says black bears are far less aggressive than brown or any other type of bear and will usually avoid human contact. However, authorities remind people that despite their temperment, black bears still are wild animals and could attack if provoked. Therefore, it is wise to let a black bear alone should you see one.

""There's little happy experiments. Things that worked out, things that didn't work out for whatever reason,"" Smith said, before admitting Shipment is the ""bane of his existence"".  Smith stated the map was originally conceived with split-screen in mind, and the team at Infinity Ward used Shipment for internal tests. It was then included in the broader ""playlist script"" for Modern Warfare, but the developer ""forgot"" to remove it before the game's final release.  After that, there was ""no going back,"" Smith recalled.  It is hard to imagine Call of Duty without Shipment.

He's this devil may care, free spirit, artistic spirit, all the things that she wants to be and she just flips the script and tells him to do his thing. I think people celebrate her empowerment as *** character in, in that moment, it's also the promise of romance, the promise of sex. It's also this great liberation and it's my 40 something year old hand as Leo's 20 year old hand. But I do the, the picture and then Leo just made some head scratching, you know, while he was fiercely concentrating on, on her and pretending to draw. The only problem is I draw left handed and he was madly drawn way right handed. I should have made *** draw left handed. When you sketch, there's an arc that's formed by your wrist. So all my lines are arching in this direction. Now, I've got to do the drawing backwards. So if you look in the movie, I'm doing the outlining, but I'm not doing any of the shading. I'm doing the smudging cause I couldn't do it because the arcs were all the wrong, wrong direction. I don't know about you, but I intend to write *** strongly worded letter to the White Star line about all this. I just think people appreciate Jack's presence of mind to be taking the stress out of the situation for her by making *** joke. And Leo played it perfect tone which was, he's shivering. He can barely form the words. He knows he's gonna die. We've already seen that he's made *** sacrifice for her, of course, very controversial. You know, that he could have gotten on the, on the, the, the raft with her, but he saw that it would have compromised her safety and he kind of steps back. He did what the gentleman on the ship did when they stepped back from the life boats to save the women and Children first because that was honor and duty. I was happy when I wrote that scene. Get away from her. You ***. That's *** great uh iconic moment. The moment we knew we had them was then they just burst into wild applause on that line. They loved it. So we knew the movie had had landed. And then you realize this movie is about two females of different species, protecting their young and it's on, it was just the right line at the right time in that movie. And then the audience response to it reminded me why you do this. I was *** marine. Hey, yeah, *** warrior of the jarhead clan. My brother Dave uh was *** marine. He died recently and you go your whole life as *** marine. Jake doesn't matter where he goes in the universe if he was *** US marine at some point, he's *** marine. Only *** marine can call himself *** jarhead unless they're *** marine. In which case it's ok. So that was just *** little inside kind of marine corps reference. I put ***, I put *** few of them in, you know, kind of for my brother Dave who's *** guy that I really loved and admired. I see here, I see you, I see you as *** very important line. It resonates for people *** lot just popped into my head while I was writing the treatment in 95. And it's like, what would *** navy greeting be? You're walking towards somebody and I see you, you know, I basically kind of the simplicity of it, right? And then it started to take on various layers of meaning as I thought, well, what do people really want? They want to be seen? They want to be acknowledged, they want to be recognized, they want to be respected, they wanna be loved seeing it. It took on *** deeper meaning. Jake's kind of struggling with the idea. But of course, the whole movie is about that. The movie starts with him opening his eyes and it ends with him opening, he has woken up to *** greater experience of the world to *** deeper understanding. He's the only human that's ever truly understood the navi from their perspective and he inhabits as his avatar, he inhabits their world. And of course, he's learning from this woman that he's falling in love with. I think you're never more open than when you're falling in love with somebody that can teach you something. And so I see you took on many meanings. You know, I understand you, I acknowledge you, I respect you, I love you. There's the top layer of the movie which is plot and character. And then there's the second layer of the movie, which is thematic, right? Which is about themes of indigenous culture and human civilization, kind of at war with itself, you know, pulling us away from our connection to nature and all those, all those things. But there's another layer, there's *** tertiary layer which is mystical. If we don't service that layer as well, then we're not really doing *** worthy sequel or worthy Sequels to the first film. It continues to be important to ask the audience to see kind of with better eyes, some of the things that are, you know, our problems and our world. I mean, Avatar doesn't pretend to have some great solution. It's just saying, you know, our our our human journey is is very troubled right now. This is our whole, this is our family, this is our fortress. I question it. As I go along spending five years on essentially one ip one, you know, it's, it's 2.5 movies that we've been working on over the last last five years. You know, I question it and then I start seeing the results and then it's *** no brainer at that point. Then it just all comes to life and that world comes to life and you see the characters come to life. It's kind of magical. You know, sometimes I have to pinch myself when I see the end result of the process. So you just have to have faith in the process as you, as you go along. I knew I wanted to tell *** family story. I wanted to as an artist express some of the, the things, the ideas, the feelings that I had as *** parent and that I had observed in my kids and I'd done sort of parent child stories in the past, even all the way back to, to aliens and uh Terminator Two, but I hadn't lived it. There was *** lot of uh sort of great dramatic grist for the mill there uh around the dysfunction of families. But how there's *** strength at the core of families that helps get people through times are all in this highly angst ridden, highly anxious time. Right now. I wanted to within *** fantasy world show, special to *** young audience. It's ok even in even, you know, 200 years from now on *** distant planet, you know, kids are still gonna feel anxious or, or, or depressed or, or unseen, it's ok. You know, I'm just not only channeling my experience as *** parent, but my experience as *** teenager myself. And I just thought that that foundation of universal human experience put into the most far flung fantasy environment that you can imagine grounds it emotionally.

"accident","2019-07-03","00:00:00","{""Perry"", ""Georgia"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 09:00:24","Although it is possible the jury made a mistake when it handed down a guilty verdict, neither Carlson nor Rittenhouse nor Abbott tried to argue the case on the merits. Instead, they made a simple assumption: that any violence against a left-wing protester is justified on its face. Perry had lived out the right-wing fantasy of lethal violence in defense of “order.” By their lights, he had done nothing wrong.  Prominent conservatives have taken the same view of Daniel Penny, the 24-year-old assailant in the killing of Jordan Neely in a New York City subway car this month. What we know is that Neely, who was homeless, was erratic and acting hostile toward other passengers. Witnesses said he had not attacked anyone. At some point, Penny, a former Marine, placed Neely in a chokehold, which killed him. Two other passengers restrained Neely while he struggled on the ground. Penny is now charged with second-degree manslaughter.  We don’t know much, yet, about Penny’s mind-set or motivation during his confrontation on the subway. But this has not stopped conservatives from valorizing him in the same way they valorized Rittenhouse and Perry. “The Marine who stepped in to protect others is a hero,” said Greene, now a congresswoman. The decision to charge Penny, said the Fox News host Greg Gutfeld, was “pro-criminal” and “anti-hero.”  In a testament to conservative enthusiasm for Penny, an online fund-raiser has raised more than $2 million for his legal defense. And DeSantis, now angling for the Republican presidential nomination, stepped in with a message of support. “We must defeat the Soros-Funded DAs, stop the Left’s pro-criminal agenda, and take back the streets for law abiding citizens,” he said on Twitter. “We stand with Good Samaritans like Daniel Penny. Let’s show this Marine … America’s got his back.”  It’s the same language, the same tropes, the same ideas. In listening to conservative fans of Rittenhouse, Perry and Penny, you would never know that there were actual people on the other side of these confrontations. You would never know that those people were, in life, entitled to the protection of the law and that they are, in death, entitled to a full account of the last moments of their lives, with legal responsibility for the men who killed them, if that’s what a jury decides.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTYvb3Bpbmlvbi9uZWVseS1wZW5ueS1wZXJyeS1yaXR0ZW5ob3VzZS1kZXNhbnRpcy5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"accident","2019-07-10","Not Discerned","{""Pittsford"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 21:45:00","PITTSFORD, N.Y. — Braden Shattuck can't quite explain why he was so intent on spending a not-insignificant portion of his childhood hitting 30-yard pitch shots from one side of his family's backyard in the Philadelphia suburbs to the other.  Where some might see monotony, Shattuck saw opportunity. There was something about the feel of that first plastic set of clubs in his hands. Something about the challenge of firing to an imaginary pin. Something about the game that gripped him early and never let go.  ""He was obsessed with (golf),"" Scott Shattuck said of his son. ""We had to almost drag him inside the house.""  So yes, Shattuck always believed there was a chance he'd make it to the sport's biggest stage. Yet the 4-year-old who took delight in tearing up his parents' yard deep into the twilight couldn't have imagined the circuitous route that brought the now-28-year-old to the 2023 PGA Championship.  The 12-footer for par that Shattuck drained to win the PGA Professional Championship in New Mexico last month assured him of a spot in the strongest field of the year starting Thursday at Oak Hill.  It also served as a testament to the relentlessness of a self-professed grinder who was forced to rebuild his swing from the ground up following a car accident in 2019 that resulted in multiple herniated disks in his lower back and made even walking difficult.  The player who would spend 12 hours a day during the summer as a kid pounding ball after ball on the practice range spent the better part of two years watching the guys he competed with on the mini-tour circuit climb the ladder while he went through countless hours of physical therapy and wondered if he'd ever be able to swing something close to pain-free again.  ""Physically you can't even play golf, and mentally it's tough because now what else do you do with your time,"" Shattuck said. ""It took a lot to get over that hurdle.""  So Shattuck poured himself into his work as an assistant golf pro, showing others how to fix their swings while trying to devise a way to tweak his own.  ""It was more of an experiment than anything,"" he said. ""I knew what exactly in my golf swing hurt, so I figured if I could do something with my setup and my golf swing to take some pressure off of those areas, that even if I didn't fully heal that maybe I could still swing a golf club with minimal pain.""  After a two-year sabbatical, his game slowly returned, though not quite the same as before. A more upright stance cost him some distance with his irons, though he has compensated by finding a few more yards with his driver. And the days of planting himself at the range for hours on end are long gone.  The pain is manageable, at least most of the time. He abandoned Korn Ferry Tour qualifying after the first round last fall when his back flared up out of nowhere. His preparation includes a series of stretching exercises and twice-weekly visits to a physical therapist, all of it tinged with just a hint of uncertainty when he wakes up in the morning.  Shattuck is confident his back and his game are in good enough shape to make the cut this weekend. Asking for anything beyond that, at least for now, is just being greedy.  While the vast majority of the 156-man field plays golf for a living, Shattuck remains primarily a teacher. The morning after he got back from his victory in New Mexico — a win that earned Shattuck $60,000, a berth into the PGA and an exemption into six events in the 2024 season — he was back at Rolling Green Golf Club in Springfield, about 15 miles west of downtown Philadelphia.  There were slices to fix. Hooks to solve. A love for the game to impart the way his father did to him as a kid. The younger Shattuck was 14 when he beat his father for the first time, shooting a 67 from the back tees at The Golf Course at Glen Mills while the adults in the group turned to his father with eyebrows raised.  ""Braden would go around (with us) and (they'd) be like, 'Damn, this kid can play,'"" Scott Shattuck said with a laugh.  Sure, his son would prefer to play with a back that doesn't require so much maintenance. Yet the unwanted sabbatical brought on by the car accident also shifted Shattuck's perspective.  ""I had a little bit more of an intense outlook when I was younger,"" he said. ""Now I just feel a lot more fortunate to be out here. I feel like I'm playing with house money so it feels more relaxed.""  At least until he stands on the tee at 7 a.m. on Thursday as part of the first group out on the East Course, a moment that seemed so far away when he was tearing up the backyard as a kid — and even farther during his long recovery following the accident — finally at hand.  Maybe the nerves he fended off during the arduous process of getting here will make a brief appearance. He's not sure.  ""That's a great question,"" he said with a laugh. ""I think we're all going to find out the answer to that one at the same time.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL2tlbm9zaGFuZXdzLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvZm91ci15ZWFycy1hZnRlci1hLWNhcmVlci10aHJlYXRlbmluZy1jYXItYWNjaWRlbnQtc2hhdHR1Y2stcmVhY2hlcy10aGUtcGdhL2FydGljbGVfYzUyZjNiNzktMmQ3OC01NTIwLTllODgtMDdjZDY0NGZmNjQ0Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The incident occurred at around 2 a.m. on Sunday, May 14th on US 287 in Wichita Falls, Texas.  According to News Channel 6, a semi truck crashed through a grassy median along US 287 and and overturned, blocking the northbound lanes and much of the southbound lanes. The overturned semi truck then caused another wreck involving two box trucks, but no one was seriously hurt in either accident.  “You’ve got a semi truck that’s overturned blocking the entire north bound lane and into the southbound lanes as well. You got another accident that’s occurred already, I think maybe both had actually occurred and because people on the south bound lane tried to stop,” said Sheriff Duke, who responded to the wreck.  After the initial wrecks, Good Samaritans on the southbound side decided to pull over and try to help, and that’s when they were fatally struck by another vehicle. Duke says that, while stopping to help is appreciated, the safety of the situation should be assessed before stopping.  “Your life has got to be there Safety first before you can save someone else’s life, and so obviously call in locations, vehicles, what they see, if they saw multiple victims, anything,” said Sheriff Duke. “If they can park in that area where they’re safe, where no traffic is going to run over them, then they can get out and help and leave their emergency hazard lights on.”  “They’re not immune to being hit by people driving with their cellphones in their face and they’re just not paying attention, it just happens,” said Sheriff Duke. “But they need to put their emergency hazards on and either get past the accident and get in a safe area they can stop in and come back up on the shoulder of the road just to avoid traffic.”  The incident is still under investigation.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vY2RsbGlmZS5jb20vMjAyMy9zZW1pLXRydWNrLWFjY2lkZW50LXR1cm5zLWZhdGFsLXdoZW4tZ29vZC1zYW1hcml0YW5zLW1ha2UtdW5zYWZlLXN0b3AtdG8taGVscC_SAWtodHRwczovL2NkbGxpZmUuY29tLzIwMjMvc2VtaS10cnVjay1hY2NpZGVudC10dXJucy1mYXRhbC13aGVuLWdvb2Qtc2FtYXJpdGFucy1tYWtlLXVuc2FmZS1zdG9wLXRvLWhlbHAvP2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"accident","2008-07-10","Not Discerned","{""Oshkosh"", ""Wisconsin"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 16:09:00","A plane flies overhead Michael Larsen’s 1954 Cessna 170B at the Oshkosh Seaplane Base. (Photo by Megan Vande Voort)  Seaplane accidents, while few, represent an area of general aviation where targeted training could pay real dividends.  That’s the takeaway from a new seaplane accident analysis report by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association Air Safety Institute (ASI).  Funded in part by the Seaplane Pilots Association, the Seaplane Accident Analysis Report 2008 – 2022 offers a detailed accident analysis, addressing flight conditions, fleet composition, accident causes, NTSB findings, and more.  The report also includes recommendations to reduce the number of accidents, including several training tips.  “Seaplanes are highly capable and uniquely suited for a wide variety of operations, but seaplane flying carries additional risk — due to the environment in which they operate — when not flown safely by proficient seaplane pilots,” says Robert Geske, AOPA Air Safety Institute manager of aviation safety analysis.  During the report period, 2008 to 2022, there were 406 seaplane accidents, with 77 ending in fatalities, he reports.  “For reference, general aviation accidents during the same period averaged 1,200 to 1,500 with 200 ending in a fatality,” he says. “The seaplane fleet makes up less than 5% of all general aviation aircraft, so understanding these types of accidents is valuable to the seaplane community.”  This report is also important as getting data has been increasingly difficult since the FAA began “repressing” seaplane activity data in 2015 “due to unreliable reporting and analysis.”  “For example, few seaplane aircraft operators report their hours. In addition, aircraft that switch out floats for other landing gear — as the season dictates — make reporting more difficult,” it continues.  The limited availability of seaplane flight hours and activity prevents a rate-based analysis of seaplane accidents. It also prevents “a meaningful year-to-year comparison and understanding of whether the rise and fall of accidents is attributed to flight activity or to an actual change,” the report notes.  With all that said, the report finds that one factor dominates the cause of seaplane accidents: Abnormal runway contact (ARC).  “This is best thought of as a landing surface contact since seaplanes do not need to operate from a paved runway surface,” according to the report. “These types of accidents occur mainly during landing (90%), with many resulting from gear-down water landings.”  The report recommends that a “broader adoption and installation of gear warning systems that aid in identifying the landing surface should reduce accidents in this category.”  It also suggests more participation by pilots in the Seaplane Pilots Association’s “Positive rate, gear up” campaign.  Loss of control in flight (LOC-I) is the deadliest cause of seaplane accidents.  “Given seaplanes’ unique operating environment, the maneuvering phase is where most of these accidents occur,” the report notes.  “Dedicated efforts targeted at low-speed awareness, distraction prevention, and positive aircraft control could drive down the frequency of fatal accidents,” it continues. “Seaplane pilots may also benefit from the installation and use of angle of attack indicators.”  It also notes that the installation of gear warning and advisory systems, which work to identify the landing surface and inform pilots of proper surface or water gear configuration, may drastically reduce nose-over events.  “While not as deadly as LOC-I, reducing the volume of accidents would, most likely, positively impact the cost and availability of insurance,” the report states.  The report concludes with a number of recommendations, including additional training, specifically in aircraft control, loss of control prevention, gear configuration, and operations during maneuvering.  One of the big issues with seaplane training are gaps in flying and training, according to the report, which notes that many pilots swap floats for skis or wheels as the seasons change.  “Seaplane pilots may experience six or more months away from seaplane operations, a situation that hinders their proficiency and impacts their training. Pilots who experience gaps due to seasonality need to take added precautions when resuming seaplane operations. Combating these gaps through a training course could help mitigate proficiency-related accidents.”  Another critical area for increased training is in decisionmaking, which was cited by the NTSB as a key contributor to seaplane accidents.  “Safety starts and ends with good decisions,” the report noted. “Reminding pilots of the effect their choices have on the outcome of the flight and helping them understand how to mitigate risks will further reduce all GA accidents.”  You can read the full report at AOPA.org/Training-and-Safety/Air-Safety-Institute/Accident-Analysis/Seaplane-Accident-Report.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vZ2VuZXJhbGF2aWF0aW9ubmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8xNi9yZXBvcnQtdGFrZXMtaW4tZGVwdGgtbG9vay1hdC1zZWFwbGFuZS1hY2NpZGVudHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Strickland was 50 on June 28, 2019, when she shot McWaters at the home they rented at 773 Target Road, just outside of Holly Hill.  There’s no debate as to whether Strickland shot and killed McWaters, but there is as to whether it was an accident or murder.  Strickland’s murder trial got underway Tuesday with 1st Circuit Assistant Solicitor David Osborne telling the jury that the killing was intentional, not any type of accident.  Osborne told the jury that McWaters was a long-time alcoholic.  “He was drinking himself to an early grave, but it should’ve been God’s call when Robert’s time on Earth was over,” he said.  Osborne claims Strickland couldn’t have accidentally shot McWaters because of the multiple safety features that were on gun used in the killing.  He also said Strickland initially told law enforcement officers that McWaters came at her, so she fired the gun at him.  The bullet struck him in his right temple.  Strickland later told investigators that McWaters challenged her knowledge of firearms.  She told investigators that she retrieved her son’s pistol from a dresser drawer in the extra bedroom.  Video of Strickland’s interview with investigators was played for the jury.  In it, she told Orangeburg County Sheriff’s Office Lt. James Shumpert that she was holding the gun and McWaters said, “You don’t know how to do it” as he sat on a chair at the kitchen table.  “I’m holding the gun. I didn’t know how to take it (the safeties) off, but I got it off,” she said.  She claims the gun accidentally discharged.  She put the gun back in its holster, according to authorities, before she called 911.  Defense attorney Jack Swerling told the jury that even though McWaters and Strickland’s relationship “was volatile and contentious, there was mutual feeling between each other. That’s why they stayed together.”  “She had no intention of leaving” the relationship, Swerling said.  The jury heard testimony that there had been a couple of calls for law enforcement to respond to the home previously concerning domestic disputes.  In one call, Strickland told responding Deputy Donald Huffman that McWaters kept waking her up while she tried to sleep.  Video footage from Huffman’s body camera was played for the jury.  Huffman told Strickland to consider going to a magistrate’s office to try to get the eviction process started to have McWaters leave.  Strickland never sought McWaters’ eviction.  Some of the witnesses the state called on Tuesday include:  Officer Michael Mann, who was employed by the Holly Hill Police Department at the time of the killing.  He was the first officer to respond to the residence at the request of the Orangeburg County Sheriff’s Office.  The jury watched Mann’s body camera video recording at the scene.  They saw Strickland was overcome with emotion and crying when Mann arrived at the house.  She was outside while using her phone and pointed to the inside of the home.  Orangeburg County Sheriff’s Office Deputy Roman Rodriguez, the first deputy to arrive on the scene.  Officer Joseph Henry Daugherty, Strickland’s ex-husband. Daugherty formerly worked at the Holly Hill Police Department, but wasn’t an officer there when McWaters was killed.  Daugherty testified that Strickland called him and told him that she’d “hurt” McWaters.  He told Strickland to call 911. He claims that she told him she did call 911, but no one answered.  Daugherty said he then called the Orangeburg County Sheriff’s Office dispatch number to report what Strickland told him.  Bruce Owens, of Holly Hill, testified that he let McWaters and Strickland rent the mobile home he had at 773 Target Road.  Owens told the jury that he’d known the McWaters family for a number of years.  He told the jury that McWaters wasn’t employed and was an alcoholic.  He also told them that Strickland was employed at tried to make ends meet in the household, but they didn’t always pay their rent on time.  Orangeburg County Sheriff’s Office Lt. William McCormick told the jury about photos he took at the crime scene, which included the shell casing from the bullet that was fired, the holstered firearm and various interior views of the home.  The trial will resume on Tuesday at 9:30 a.m. The trial is expected to last three or four days.  Circuit Judge Diane Goodstein is presiding.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFodHRwczovL3RoZXRhbmRkLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2NyaW1lLWFuZC1jb3VydHMvd29tYW4tb24tdHJpYWwtaW4taG9sbHktaGlsbC1kZWF0aC1kZWZlbnNlLXNob290aW5nLXdhcy1hY2NpZGVudC9hcnRpY2xlX2M5YTFlOTY4LWY0NDAtMTFlZC1hNDgyLTNiY2EyZWE0OWExYy5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(CBS 58) -- An Oconomowoc family is advocating for safer bike paths after their daughter and sister, Sarah Debbink Langenkamp, was killed in an accident in August 2022.  Langenkamp was biking in Bethesda, Maryland when the driver of a semi-truck hit and killed her while turning right into a parking lot.  ""All that white line is, is an invitation. It's a death trap to bicyclists who think they're safe because they're in a bike lane,"" Dirk Debbink, Langenkamp's father, said.  Langenkamp's family immediately channeled their pain into action by gaining the attention of U.S. lawmakers who sponsored the Sarah Debbink Langenkamp Active Transportation Act.  ""It can't bring Sarah back, but over 1,000 people are killed every year, bicyclists and pedestrians in our country -- but can we make a 5% difference? That's 50 people. Ten percent? That's 100 people that don't have to go through this,"" Debbink said.  The bill would allocate existing federal funding to allow state and local government to build safer pathways for bicyclists and pedestrians.  ""Every day the dollars sit there and not out here, it's another day somebody else could get killed,"" Debbink said.  The Oconomowoc Common Council voted unanimously to support the Sarah Debbink Langenkamp Active Transportation Act on Tuesday.  ""We're going to do our best to help this tragedy become something positive,"" Oconomowoc Mayor Robert Magnus said.  Magnus and the Common Council are sending the Debbink family off to Washington D.C. with their signed letter of support.  Langenkamp's parents, Dirk and Terry Debbink, are meeting with lawmakers, including Sen. Ron Johnson and Sen. Tammy Baldwin on Wednesday.  ""We're all in. Let's make a difference if we can,"" Dirk Debbink said.  Langenkamp's family told CBS 58 she learned how to ride a bike in Oconomowoc where she grew up. Her passion for biking carried her throughout the world in countries like Uganda and Ukraine, where she served as a U.S. diplomat.  ""She loved biking and really committed to commuting by bike in whatever country she was working in,"" Alicia Bosscher, Langenkamp's sister, said.

The car that hit him fled the scene, and officers made no mention of the vehicle’s make or model. Authorities added that the victim was rushed to an area hospital, where he remains in serious but stable condition.  The prosecutor’s office requests that anybody with knowledge of the accident contact them. An investigation remains ongoing in the meantime.    Our thoughts are with the injured victim and his family at this time. We hope for his full recovery.  Pedestrian Accident Injuries in New Jersey  According to the most recent available accident statistics, a pedestrian was killed in a traffic collision in New Jersey 27% of the time over the last year alone.  Tragically, any pedestrian in New Jersey who is out for a stroll runs the risk of being in a collision. But some age groups see more traffic-related fatalities than others. For instance, adults over the age of 65 make up about 20% of all pedestrian accident fatalities. What’s more, New Jersey ranked among the top states for pedestrian deaths and injuries.  The busy streets in New Jersey clearly pose a threat to pedestrians, but the state has passed several laws that drivers must abide by to keep pedestrians safe. Drivers that break these prohibitions may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, particularly if a pedestrian is hurt. Drivers in New Jersey have a duty of care to pedestrians, and when they fail to uphold this responsibility, they may be held civilly accountable. Although pedestrians frequently sustain injuries in accidents, you have the right to use the road safely as a pedestrian in New Jersey.  At any time and at every intersection, pedestrians have the right to cross the roadway safely while walking on the sidewalk. Drivers are accountable for maintaining awareness of their surroundings and treating every other vehicle—including bicycles, trucks, and pedestrians—with respect. People’s disregard for others causes these awful accidents. You don’t have to go through this ordeal by yourself. You need to seek the assistance of a New Jersey pedestrian accident attorney.  If you have a Jersey City pedestrian accident lawyer on your side, your chances of winning your personal injury case will be greatly boosted.

Share Copy Link Copy  Hide Transcript Show Transcript  Leo played it perfect tone which was, he's shivering. He could barely form the words, he knows he's gonna die. We've already seen that. He's made *** sacrifice for her. Of course, very controversial. You know, that he could have gotten on the, on the, the, the raft with her, but he saw that it would have compromised her safety and he kind of steps back. He did what the gentleman on the ship did. I was happy when I wrote that scene, I'll be back, I'll be back. So that, that's *** funny thing because in the script, it, it actually read, I think I'll come back and there was something about the way Arnold said it with his then quite thick Austrian accent. That didn't sound quite right. And so I said, well, just switch it to, I'll be back, you know, and he said, really? I said, yeah, and we just kind of, you know, made it up, made it up in the moment and of course, it became quite iconic. But here's the interesting thing about that line. You're watching the movie for the first time, you have no idea what's gonna happen next. And yet it still got *** laugh somehow people had gotten already. This guy was this bulldozer. You just get this innate sense of this guy as just this juggernaut. And when he says I'll be back, it's gonna be bad. So people laughed before they even knew they didn't even know what *** Terminator movie was at that point. Well, I think they were starting to figure it out. Come with me if you want to live. Terminator Two. That's the pivotal moment where Sarah has this stunning realization that the Terminator that's before her, her worst nightmare has turned into her savior and the savior of her son. And it was just *** fun moment to see how Linda would play that. We knew it was *** tough moment for her because her whole reality literally flips upside down. She played it beautifully. It's just *** nice piece of acting chicken. Oh, it's *** pure moment of exultation for him. He's just alive. He's in the moment he doesn't have *** penny in his pocket. He won the damn ticket in *** poker game. He's just living carefree fancy free. He's met Fabrizio and they're just having fun. It was an expression of life, his life spirit, which seems so unquenchable and so full of potential. Every time I'm aching by, I'm getting ready to do *** run. I'm, I'm talking to Leo on the radio. Ok. Howl, like *** wolf. You know, I got him howling like *** wolf. We tried it, you know, I don't know, 10 times and he looked great and his, his acting spirit was there, but we just couldn't quite find the right word and it just popped into my head. I said, just say, I'm the king of the world. I hear back on the lucky what I said, you gotta sell it, you gotta sell it. You know, just say I'm the king of the world and he did and he put his arms out and you feel that spirit and it became the focal point of the whole scene, the whole ship's energy, the pounding of the engines, the dolphins jumping and everything, all, you know, the sort of the beauty and the power and the majesty of it all culminated to his, his spirit at the, at the bow. Now I come along at the Academy Awards and make the classic mistake of assuming that just because we had won best picture or that, that I got be best director that everybody in the room loved the movie and would celebrate *** reference to the movie, but they weren't, not everybody voted for it, right? And the knives are always, they're, they're kind of always half drawn even when they're there to celebrate you. The knife is half out of the, out of the, the hilt. I mean out of the, the sheath, right? Yeah. So I put my foot in that one, Jack. I want you to draw me like one of your French girls, *** lot of people have, have kind of mocked and spoofed that line. But I think *** lot of people really like it. She's bold. She's taking the power. She's been robbed of power by her fiance, by her mother, by her social straitjacket. He's this devil may care, free spirit, artistic spirit, all the things that she wants to be and she just flips the script and tells him to do his thing. I think people celebrate her empowerment as *** character in, in that moment, it's also the promise of romance, the promise of sex. It's also this great liberation and it's my 40 something year old hand as Leo's 20 year old hand. But I do the, the picture and then Leo just made some head scratching, you know, while he was fiercely concentrating on, on her and pretending to draw. The only problem is I draw left handed and he was madly drawn way right handed. I should have made *** draw left handed. When you sketch, there's an arc that's formed by your wrist. So all my lines are arching in this direction. Now, I've got to do the drawing backwards. So if you look in the movie, I'm doing the outlining, but I'm not doing any of the shading. I'm doing the smudging cause I couldn't do it because the arcs were all the wrong, wrong direction. I don't know about you, but I intend to write *** strongly worded letter to the White Star line about all this. I just think people appreciate Jack's presence of mind to be taking the stress out of the situation for her by making *** joke. And Leo played it perfect tone which was, he's shivering. He can barely form the words. He knows he's gonna die. We've already seen that he's made *** sacrifice for her, of course, very controversial. You know, that he could have gotten on the, on the, the, the raft with her, but he saw that it would have compromised her safety and he kind of steps back. He did what the gentleman on the ship did when they stepped back from the life boats to save the women and Children first because that was honor and duty. I was happy when I wrote that scene. Get away from her. You ***. That's *** great uh iconic moment. The moment we knew we had them was then they just burst into wild applause on that line. They loved it. So we knew the movie had had landed. And then you realize this movie is about two females of different species, protecting their young and it's on, it was just the right line at the right time in that movie. And then the audience response to it reminded me why you do this. I was *** marine. Hey, yeah, *** warrior of the jarhead clan. My brother Dave uh was *** marine. He died recently and you go your whole life as *** marine. Jake doesn't matter where he goes in the universe if he was *** US marine at some point, he's *** marine. Only *** marine can call himself *** jarhead unless they're *** marine. In which case it's ok. So that was just *** little inside kind of marine corps reference. I put ***, I put *** few of them in, you know, kind of for my brother Dave who's *** guy that I really loved and admired. I see here, I see you, I see you as *** very important line. It resonates for people *** lot just popped into my head while I was writing the treatment in 95. And it's like, what would *** navy greeting be? You're walking towards somebody and I see you, you know, I basically kind of the simplicity of it, right? And then it started to take on various layers of meaning as I thought, well, what do people really want? They want to be seen? They want to be acknowledged, they want to be recognized, they want to be respected, they wanna be loved seeing it. It took on *** deeper meaning. Jake's kind of struggling with the idea. But of course, the whole movie is about that. The movie starts with him opening his eyes and it ends with him opening, he has woken up to *** greater experience of the world to *** deeper understanding. He's the only human that's ever truly understood the navi from their perspective and he inhabits as his avatar, he inhabits their world. And of course, he's learning from this woman that he's falling in love with. I think you're never more open than when you're falling in love with somebody that can teach you something. And so I see you took on many meanings. You know, I understand you, I acknowledge you, I respect you, I love you. There's the top layer of the movie which is plot and character. And then there's the second layer of the movie, which is thematic, right? Which is about themes of indigenous culture and human civilization, kind of at war with itself, you know, pulling us away from our connection to nature and all those, all those things. But there's another layer, there's *** tertiary layer which is mystical. If we don't service that layer as well, then we're not really doing *** worthy sequel or worthy Sequels to the first film. It continues to be important to ask the audience to see kind of with better eyes, some of the things that are, you know, our problems and our world. I mean, Avatar doesn't pretend to have some great solution. It's just saying, you know, our our our human journey is is very troubled right now. This is our whole, this is our family, this is our fortress. I question it. As I go along spending five years on essentially one ip one, you know, it's, it's 2.5 movies that we've been working on over the last last five years. You know, I question it and then I start seeing the results and then it's *** no brainer at that point. Then it just all comes to life and that world comes to life and you see the characters come to life. It's kind of magical. You know, sometimes I have to pinch myself when I see the end result of the process. So you just have to have faith in the process as you, as you go along. I knew I wanted to tell *** family story. I wanted to as an artist express some of the, the things, the ideas, the feelings that I had as *** parent and that I had observed in my kids and I'd done sort of parent child stories in the past, even all the way back to, to aliens and uh Terminator Two, but I hadn't lived it. There was *** lot of uh sort of great dramatic grist for the mill there uh around the dysfunction of families. But how there's *** strength at the core of families that helps get people through times are all in this highly angst ridden, highly anxious time. Right now. I wanted to within *** fantasy world show, special to *** young audience. It's ok even in even, you know, 200 years from now on *** distant planet, you know, kids are still gonna feel anxious or, or, or depressed or, or unseen, it's ok. You know, I'm just not only channeling my experience as *** parent, but my experience as *** teenager myself. And I just thought that that foundation of universal human experience put into the most far flung fantasy environment that you can imagine grounds it emotionally.

"accident","2023-05-03","Not Discerned","{""Camden"", ""NewJersey"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 23:00:46","MEDFORD - When a beloved employee at Lenape High School was hurt in a May 3 traffic accident, the school community responded with an outpouring of support.  An online campaign raised tens of thousands of dollars, with many donations accompanied by wishes of a fast recovery for Mary Jane Mullen, a Lenape secretary for the past 61 years.  But the campaign’s tenor changed abruptly when Mullen, 79, died from her injuries Sunday.  More: Lenape team among the 15Which teams made our South Jersey Mean 15 softball rankings after the sixth week?  “The Lenape family suffered a profound loss today,” Tony Cattani, the school’s principal said in an update to the GoFundMe account after Mullen’s death.  “Mary Jane was the embodiment of all that is good in our world,” Cattani wrote.  Mary Jane Mullen spent her career at Lenape  “She felt a genuine love for all things Lenape, including students, staff, and alumni,” he said. “She was always ready with a hug, a kiss, and some candy for anyone who needed it.”  Mullen, a sophomore when Lenape opened in 1958, went to work for the school’s administration one month after graduating from Lenape in June 1961.  ""Her hiring forever changed Lenape High School,"" a statement from Lenape Regional School District said Tuesday.  Mullen sent thousands of personal notes  It described Mullen, who had led a student club for future secretaries, as ""the heart of Lenape High School.""  ""She approached each day with genuine love, kindness and caring,"" the statement said.  Over the decades, the Medford resident sent ""thousands upon thousands of personalized notes"" to students, staffers and Lenape family members, said Carol Birnbohm, the district's superintendent.  She said the notes delivered messages of encouragement, gratitude and love from Mullen, who also bought Christmas ornaments and other gifts for students and staff.  One note, written last month, described Lenape as Mullen's ""happy place.""  ""I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else. This is my home,"" it said.  Cattani said graduates who return to the school for reunion activities typically inquire about Mullen.  ""Without fail, the first thing they ask is, ‘Is Mary Jane still here?’”  A display of photos in Lenape's 1980 yearbook, Legend, shows Mullen surrounded by smiling students. A sketch depicts a harried secretary typing between wire baskets piled high with papers.  The headlines read “MJ Club” and “Mary Jane, Mary Jane, She’s Our Girl.”  Text with the photos describes Mullen as “bubbling with effervescence” and notes she “attracts all sorts to her office.”  GoFundMe appeal started on day of accident  A Lenape graduate launched the GoFundMe campaign on the day of Mullen's accident. It sought to help with Mullen’s medical costs and to support a scholarship fund in her honor.  According to Medford police, Mullen's car collided with another vehicle at Route 70 and North Main Street.  She was taken to the trauma center at Cooper University Hospital, Camden. The other driver had no reported injuries from the accident, which remains under investigation.  Mullen initially was in good spirits but still had “a long road ahead,” said the appeal, which had raised almost $50,000 by Wednesday evening.  The expressions of hope and affection turned somber on Sunday.  ""Mary Jane was a Saint to all who entered her Office Domain,"" wrote one donor, Daniel Archibald. ""She will be missed but hopefully her legacy survives.""  “MaryJane is (an) angel now and always has been,” said another donor, Susan Burns.  Cattani noted members of Burlington County’s school crisis response team and other school counselors were made available to students and staffers.  “I ask all of our members of the Lenape Family to look after one another as we deal with the loss of our friend and someone who truly exemplified Lenape High School,” the principal wrote.  He said the school ""will plan a special way to memorialize Mary Jane in the near future.""  Services will be held at St. Mary of the Lakes Church, 40 Jackson Road, Medford, where friends may call Wednesday from 6 to 9 p.m.  A Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated Thursday.  Burial will be private.  Jim Walsh is a senior reporter at the Courier-Post, Burlington County Times and The Daily Journal.

The Utah Occupational Safety and Health Division “will not be investigating the fatality specifically but looking for any safety violations that could have caused or contributed to the cause of the accident,” Eric Olsen, communications director for the Utah Labor Commission, said Tuesday.  A statement from the Clearfield Police Department said Monday’s incident at Americold at 755 E. 1700 South is being investigated but that “initial information suggests this was a tragic accident.” The department didn’t name the 38-year-old man pending notification of extended family members.  The Clearfield incident is the 10th industrial death this year. “So far this year, including yesterday’s unfortunate event, there have been 10 workplace fatalities that fall under UOSH jurisdiction and are not attributed to preexisting conditions or sudden health problems such as heart attack,” Olsen said.  The man was somehow pinned between a forklift and freezer shelves, according to the Clearfield Police Department.  “First responders worked quickly and were able to free the victim from the entrapment and rendered some medical aid on scene in preparation for transport to the hospital,” said the police statement.

To tell the story of its accidental origin, you need to know why it's special in the first place. Ice wine, often written as one word ('icewine') in Canada, and known as 'eiswein' in its native land of Germany, is wine pressed from frozen grapes.  The flavor of grape juice comes from the various sugars, acids, and aromatic compounds it contains, but a majority of the juice (roughly 70-80%) is plain old water. When grapes are left on the vine in the winter snow, that water freezes and the flavorful compounds separate. Thus, when the grapes are finally juiced, the water content is far lower than usual, resulting in juice that is more like extremely concentrated grape syrup. After the mixture is fermented for a few months, you're left with one of the sweetest and most flavorful wines in existence. The results are rather magical, and it's all thanks to the ingenuity of German vintners, who adapted to sudden harsh conditions.

Gaston Co- Lucia Riverbend Fire shared these pictures after two personal watercraft crashed on Mountain Island Lake sending five people to the hospital. The latest on the investigation and the injuries tonight on channel 9 eyewitness news at five. pic.twitter.com/0VNvjnyL8V — Dave Faherty (@FahertyWSOC9) May 15, 2023  NC Wildlife said the crash happened Sunday at the Riverbend Boat Landing on Eddie Nichols Drive shortly before 6:30 p.m.  The people on the Sea-Doos did not know each other, investigators said, and they don’t think drugs or alcohol were involved.  All five patients were taken to the hospital with injuries that varied from minor to severe. Investigators say there were two adults on one Sea-Doo and three juveniles on the other.  The Lucia-Riverbend Fire Department told Channel 9′s Dave Faherty they have already responded to four accidents on the lake over the last four weeks, including one drowning.  “When they’re out there riding, they’re riding erratically. And I say with due disregard, they’re just not really paying attention,” Fire Chief David Toomey said. “They’re just trying to have a good time and I understand that.”  The wreck comes one week after Willie Gray heard an out of control personal watercraft strike his dock at the home he’s lived in for more than 30 years.  “As you can see right now, it’s very calm, but on the weekends it gets crazy here,” Gray said. “And it’s still early in the season.”  Crews are urging people to make sure they use the kill switch on their personal watercraft and wear a flotation device when on the water. It’s something Tomas Suska knows all too well. He said five years ago, he was on a jet ski when he was struck and had to go to the hospital afterwards.  “Just got in a T-bone accident and didn’t have time to react. The guy was broken in two different places, so you just got to be very careful,” he said.  Faherty asked NC Wildlife about possible charges in the Sea-Doo crash they said the case remains under investigation.  This is a developing story, check back at wsoctv.com for updates.

Another man was seriously injured in Cooper County after an ATV crash Saturday. Two other reports of ATV crashes were recorded in the past week from Moniteau County and Randolph County.  An increase in off-road riders starts anytime temperatures rise, Cpl. Kyle Green with the Missouri State Highway Patrol said. But the chance of getting into an accident also grows.  “They're not toys at all,” Green added. “But that's the way many people view them.”  Last year alone, the Missouri State Highway Patrol recorded 284 total ATV crashes in the state. Over 70% of those resulted in injuries and 23 of those crashes were fatal. In many cases, Green said safety devices in the vehicle weren’t being used if they had them.  “That's unfortunately where we get many of these serious crashes,” Green said. “Where people aren't wearing helmets or they're not wearing the seatbelts and they get thrown out into the woods.”  At the same time, all-terrain vehicle crashes present a different problem for first responders. Cole County EMS said Sunday’s crash was in a remote location.  “ATVs present a little bit more of an operational issue for us,” Eric Hoy the Chief of Emergency Medical Services said. “We think there was a delay in activating 911 because they were in such a rural area that they had to get somewhere where they could actually call.”  Additionally, ambulances were not able to reach the scene alone. The EMS Incident Commander requested mutual aid for all-terrain transport vehicles from the Cole County Emergency Response Team, the Jefferson City Fire Department and Osage Ambulance District.  “It really limits the capabilities of the first responders,” Green said. “If you're going to be out on property that's in a hard-to-reach spot, hard to locate, then you need to let somebody know… in case something happens, at least we have an idea where to start searching.”  Driving an all-terrain vehicle impaired is just that too- impaired driving. In 2022, the Missouri State Highway Patrol recorded 50 ATV accidents caused by drinking or drugs.  “Operating these while impaired is dangerous for not only them but for the other people that are out on the roadways,” Green added.  In Missouri, there’s no set age to drive an all-terrain vehicle. While children under 18 must legally wear a helmet, they can drive freely on private property. In the same way, the Missouri State Highway Patrol warns it’s the parent’s responsibility to make sure the kid is ready “mentally and physically” to drive an ATV.  Wearing a helmet and seatbelt, if the vehicle has one, can decrease the chances of being injured in an ATV or UTV crash Green said. Letting someone know where you’re headed and having a way to contact 911 if needed can help emergency services get to you more quickly if needed.  Driving an ATV with the same mentality as driving a vehicle could help avoid an accident completely.  “Just be sure to take extra caution just like you would in your vehicle,” Hoy added.  Drivers can find more on ATV or UTV rules and regulations for Missouri here.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vYWJjMTduZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL3RyYW5zcG9ydGF0aW9uLzIwMjMvMDUvMTQvYXR2LXNhZmV0eS1wcmVjYXV0aW9ucy1hcy1hY2NpZGVudHMtY29udGludWUtaW4tbWlzc291cmkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
