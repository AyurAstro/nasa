Uğur Karahanlı’s father and mother died shortly before first responders arrived on the scene, while his wife was seriously injured in the accident.  According to local reports, Karahanlı, a former teacher who was dismissed by a government decree as part of purges that followed a July 15, 2016 coup attempt, was in 2021 sentenced to six-and-a-half years in prison on conviction of alleged links to the movement.  Karahanlı had previously been jailed in a prison in southern Hatay province, one of the areas hardest hit by two powerful earthquakes in early February, after which he was transferred to the prison in central Turkey.  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has been targeting followers of the Gülen movement, inspired by Turkish Muslim cleric Fethullah Gülen, since the corruption investigations of December 17-25, 2013, which implicated then-prime minister Erdoğan, his family members and his inner circle.  Dismissing the investigations as a Gülenist coup and conspiracy against his government, Erdoğan designated the movement as a terrorist organization and began to target its members. He intensified the crackdown on the movement after the abortive putsch in 2016, which he accused Gülen of masterminding. Gülen and the movement strongly deny involvement in the coup attempt or any terrorist activity.  Following the failed coup, the Turkish government declared a state of emergency and carried out a massive purge of state institutions under the pretext of an anti-coup fight.  More than 130,000 public servants, including 4,156 judges and prosecutors, as well as 24,706 members of the armed forces were summarily removed from their jobs for alleged membership in or relationships with “terrorist organizations” by emergency decree-laws subject to neither judicial nor parliamentary scrutiny.  Former public servants were not only fired from their jobs; they were also banned from working again in the public sector and getting a passport. The government also made it difficult for them to work formally in the private sector. Notes were put on the social security database about dismissed public servants to deter potential employers, leading them to work in unskilled jobs with little workplace safety. There have been a number of cases in which former public servants died in occupational accidents."

(Mainichi/Ryutaro Nishimoto)  MAEBASHI -- The parents of a 19-year-old university student who died in a recent rafting accident on the Tone River in Gunma Prefecture are seeking answers after he was found without a life jacket, and it emerged a guide on another boat had said the student's raft would capsize.  The victim, Keisuke Honda, had only just entered a national university in Tokyo, and on the day of the accident, he left his family home early in the morning. ""I had no idea that he was going rafting,"" his mother said. His father added, ""I thought he was going on a day trip with friends and that he would come back as normal.""  At around 6:45 p.m. on May 5, the parents received a call from Gunma Prefecture Police's Numata Police Station, informing them of the accident. They went by car to Gunma, arriving at about 9 p.m. It was dark and they couldn't see any rescue boats out.  ""Is no one looking for our son?"" they wondered in shock. The parents took out a flashlight they had bought on the way and made their way through the grass at the side of the river.  ""I thought that if he was in water as cold as this, I wanted to rescue him quickly,"" the father said. Multiple cuts ran up his arms, apparently made by the grass.  Son found with no life jacket  The teen's parents spent seven hours searching a roughly 1 kilometer stretch of the river starting from the accident site, but didn't find anything. Police resumed their search at 5 a.m. on May 6, and at 5:49 a.m. they found him about 300 meters downstream from the Suwakyo Bridge over the Tone River. The cause of death was drowning. He was not wearing a life jacket.  The parents met with officials from the rafting tour company at Numata Police Station on May 6, and spoke with them for about an hour. They asked about the situation at the time their son's raft capsized and about rescue efforts immediately afterward, but said they didn't receive a concrete explanation. ""They didn't tell us anything,"" the student's father recalled angrily.  Their distrust grew after they heard about conditions at the time of the accident from a man in another rafting boat, who took part in the same tour.  According to the man, the participants were in three boats, with two full of families with children, and a blue one carrying Honda and his friends. The man said that when he got into his boat, the guide said, ""That blue boat is going to capsize."" The other boats passed the accident site safely and then waited for the blue boat, and again the guide said that Honda's boat would capsize.  After the accident, the other two rafts were taken to the side of the river and the tour ended partway through. Participants were reportedly handed commemorative photos at this point, taken by a photographer who was following the boats in a vehicle along the river. The man said he wanted Honda's parents to know the river conditions at the time, and handed his photos to them, and also told them about what he saw.  Rocks and driftwood are seen scattered about at the scene of the accident as water splashes up, on the Tone River in Minakami, Gunma Prefecture, on May 9, 2023. (Mainichi/Ryutaro Nishimoto)  The photos showed Honda wearing a life jacket and a helmet, shoulder to shoulder with his friends, and showed him laughing as water splashed above the raft.  His mother said, ""It was a dangerous activity. He was suddenly thrown out into water chilly with snowmelt, and his life jacket was carried downstream, so he must have sunk into the water around where the boat capsized. The tour guide's rescue effort wasn't enough at all. I want the police to conduct a proper investigation.""  Operating company: 'A turn of events we can't take back'  The president of the company that organized the tour commented, ""I'm truly sorry that there has been a turn of events we can't take back. We will consider efforts to prevent a recurrence and think about how to atone for this.""  According to the president, participants sign consent forms acknowledging that if they fall out of the boat and stand up the current, their legs could get pinned against rocks and they could suffer broken bones or even drown. Verbal explanations were also given to make people aware of the risks.  On the possibility of a boat capsizing, the company president said, there were times when people played balancing games, standing on the edge of the boat and that the boats would sometimes capsize as a result. But people don't do that in the current season when there is a lot of water in the river and the temperature is cold.  Regarding the comment from the passenger on the other boat that their guide had said that the blue boat would capsize, the president said, ""When two boats have gone ahead and are waiting, we sometimes humorously explain that we will help the other one in such and such a way if they capsize.""  According to Outdoor Joint Association Minakami, an organization of Gunma Prefecture-based rafting companies, safety checks are conducted along the Tone River five times a year, and if tour guides find anything abnormal, they are required to quickly report it to the association. Each operator is also certified in whitewater rescue and first aid. Association director Mitsuyoshi Ishikawa commented, ""If something happens, we respond quickly. We've established fairly strict safety standards.""  A total of four people died in Tone River rafting accidents in Gunma Prefecture between 2000 and 2002 -- two male and one female passenger in their 20s and 30s and one male guide in his 20s.  Water safety group chairman: 'Wear your life jacket properly'  Hidetoshi Saito, chairman of the Society of Water Rescue and Survival Research and a graduate school professor at the Nagaoka University of Technology in Niigata Prefecture, commented, ""People need to be aware that boats can sink or capsize. That's not to say that we shouldn't get into them; rather I want people to wear life jackets properly so they can enjoy the ride.""  In the event of an accident such as a boat capsizing, it is important to float on the water to ensure one can breathe. According to Saito, life jackets can come off easily if only the zipper is closed, so the belt and buckle need to be fastened tighter than people might expect. He says that if the belt and buckle hadn't come undone, then the student may have slipped out of the life jacket, but if there were undone, then there is a possibility he either wasn't wearing it properly or had undone it himself before drowning. ""If he wasn't wearing it properly from the start then the operator would be held responsible,"" he said.  (Japanese original by Azusa Hinata and Ryutaro Nishimoto, Maebashi Bureau)"

Credit: JavierLJ/Shutterstock.com.  Chinese mining company Zijin Mining has reported a mining accident at one of its mines in Tibet, the circumstances of which have led to the stopping of production.  On 14 May, a lift cage fell during shaft construction in the drainage system at the Julong open-pit copper and polymetallic mine, cutting contact with six workers.  Zijin has suspended mining production at the site and launched search and rescue operations for the missing workers.  The company added that it has carried out an investigation and rectification of the hidden risks. The cause of the accident is still being investigated.  The construction of the Julong mine was subcontracted to Fujian Xingwanxiang Construction Group by Zijin subsidiary Tibet Julong Copper.  Zijin owns a 50.1% stake in the Julong mine, which produced 115,000 tonnes (t) of copper last year and is planning to increase its production to 152,000t this year.  Phase one production at Julong Copper began in December 2021. Located in the Tibetan plateau at an altitude between 4,000m and 5,000m, the mine features 10.7 million tonnes of copper and 570,000t of molybdenum.  Last month, the company through Barrick Gold, a joint venture with Barrick Niugini (BNL), entered a New Porgera Progress Agreement (NPPA) with the Papua New Guinea Government.  According to the NPPA, all three parties – Zijin, BNL and the Papua New Guinea Government – have agreed to reopen the Porgera Gold Mine at the earliest opportunity.  Operations at the mine were suspended in April 2020 due to the failure to secure approval for its extension. The NPPA signing is an important milestone in resuming operations."

After making sure everyone is safe and getting medical attention if necessary, many individuals find themselves wondering what else needs to be done or what rights they may have under the law.  To help sort out this legal process of a car accident case and know what information will be relevant during such proceedings, here are some key points to keep in mind for both women and men.  How to File a Claim After an Accident  Filing a claim after an accident can be a complicated and time-consuming process, but it is essential to ensure that you receive the compensation you deserve. Whether you were involved in a car accident, slip and fall, or any other type of incident, it’s crucial to seek legal advice right away to understand your rights and responsibilities.  You will need to gather evidence, such as photographs, witness statements, and medical records, to support your claim. It’s important to remember that insurance companies may try to offer you a settlement that is not in your best interest, so having an experienced attorney in your corner can help you navigate the claim process and negotiate a fair settlement. Don’t hesitate to reach out to a legal professional for assistance in filing your claim and protecting your rights.  Getting legal advice  The legal process for a car accident case can be complex, so it is always in your best interest to get legal advice as soon as possible. An experienced attorney will help you understand the laws that apply to your situation and provide sound legal advice on how to proceed with your claim. Whether you decide to get advice from youraccidentattorneys.com, or research to find a suitable attorney, make sure you are getting assistance from a qualified professional. When you are represented by a qualified attorney, you will be able to rest assured that your claim is in capable hands and that your rights are being appropriately protected.  Types of Damages You Can Seek in a Car Accident Case  In car accident cases, the types of damages that can be sought can vary greatly depending on the circumstances of the incident. The most common types of damages that plaintiffs may seek include compensation for medical expenses, lost wages, property damage, and pain and suffering.  However, there are other damages that may also be applicable, such as punitive damages, which are intended to punish a defendant for particularly egregious behavior. It is important to work with an experienced attorney who can guide you through the legal process and help you pursue the appropriate damages for your case. Don’t hesitate to seek legal advice if you’ve been involved in a car accident and believe you deserve compensation for any losses or injuries suffered.  Proving Fault in a Car Accident Case  When it comes to car accident cases, proving fault can be a complex process that often ends up in court. Legal professionals and insurance companies will examine a variety of factors, including police reports, witness statements, and medical evidence to determine who is at fault for the accident. It is important to remember that proving fault is not simply about assigning blame, but rather about providing justice and ensuring that the responsible party is held accountable for their actions. Therefore, if you are involved in a car accident, it is crucial to seek legal representation to ensure that your rights are upheld and the responsible party is brought to justice.  Common Defense Strategies Used in Car Accident Cases  When it comes to car accident cases, common defense strategies are often employed in an effort to minimize or eliminate liability. One such strategy involves arguing that the plaintiff was partially or completely at fault for the accident. Another common defense tactic is to challenge the plaintiff’s claims of injury or damages, often by questioning the severity of the injuries or the validity of the medical treatment received. Moreover, defendants may attempt to settle the case for a smaller amount by arguing that the plaintiff had pre-existing injuries or conditions that were aggravated by the accident. It is important to work with an experienced attorney who can help navigate these defense strategies and fight for your rights in court.  Timeline of the Legal Process for a Car Accident Case  When you’ve been in a car accident, the legal process can seem daunting and complicated. However, it’s important to understand the timeline of events that will unfold. The process typically begins with filing a claim with your insurance company, followed by an investigation into the accident and determining who is at fault.  From there, negotiations may take place to reach a settlement. If a settlement cannot be reached, the case will proceed to court where a judge or jury will ultimately determine the outcome. It’s important to have a knowledgeable and experienced legal team on your side to guide you through each step of the process and ensure that your rights are protected.  The legal process of a car accident case can be a painstaking one requiring effort from all parties involved in order to satisfactorily resolve the dispute. It is vital for those who are involved in an accident to understand their rights and the steps they can take toward seeking the damages they deserve. Knowing who is at fault for an accident, what types of damages you can recover, and having a timeline for the progression of your case will help ensure that proceedings move quickly and efficiently. With this knowledge in hand, each party can work together to ensure a swift resolution in their car accident case."

Warren,29, was walking along the junction of Trinity Church Road and North Shore Road between 2 am and 3:15 am when he was struck by a car.  His death took Bermuda’s road fatality toll for 2023 to five.  In a social media post, the Bermuda Football Association (BFA) said it “joins the Warren and Bermuda football family in mourning the loss of a rising icon of the beautiful game, Marco Warren, who had his debut international cap for Bermuda in March 2015 against Nicaragua. The match resulted in a 2-0 victory for our Gombey Warriors.  “BFA extends its heartfelt condolences to Marco’s family, friends, teammates, and fans. Our logo will be displayed in black until Marco’s funeral”.  Warren’s club, the PHC Zebras, also paid tribute to him saying they will never forget the impact that their star player had on the team and Bermuda.  “Marco was more than just a player. He was a part of our family, embodied the Zebra spirit, and was the heart of our team. Marco continually left fans in awe of his skills and inspired other players to improve. He was a humble person despite his level of greatness. When he was on the field, the “magician” just went to work,” the club said.  “Marco was a loving father, son, brother, boyfriend, nephew, cousin, teammate, and true friend. He was a leader both on and off the field as he demonstrated the well-rounded individual we aspire to develop for our community. All who encountered him were impressed with his wisdom and kindness.”  Bermudian star and Bristol City player Nahki Wells also remembered his teammate on Instagram.  Photo: @nahkiwells on Instagram  Wells posted a photo of him and Warren celebrating during a match.

Nearly five of those collisions turn out fatal. These kinds of accidents can lead to life-changing disabilities and catastrophic financial losses. You might lose work hours, incur thousands of medical bills, and experience severe trauma. If you or a loved one has been injured in an accident, consult Edmonton pedestrian accident lawyers who can help you overcome all three challenges. However, you can take a few steps at the accident spot to solidify your legal claim.  1) Call for Medical Assistance  Your health is the most important consideration after a collision. Severe injuries don’t always make themselves known straight away. Shock can mask pain, so getting an assessment from a qualified healthcare provider is crucial. That said, this is when the evidence is at its best, so contact local law enforcement as soon as you’ve called for medical assistance. If your injuries are too severe to gather photographs and numbers, police presence at the scene will bolster your case.  An emergency room assessment is one of the most powerful things you can do to prove your damages. The sooner you see a doctor, the more convincing your evidence will be. Remember that personal injury cases draw more compensation when there’s solid diagnostic evidence, so X-rays and the like are key.  2) Gather Contact Information  Eyewitnesses disperse quickly. If your injuries aren’t life-threatening, exchanging information with everyone involved in the collision is essential. If there are eyewitnesses in sight, gather their contact details as well. You should also collect the insurance details of the at-fault party. While the police will gather their evidence, you should also take your photographs. If you see skid marks, car dents, or any other forms of damage, assume that an expert could use them to prove the cause of the accident. Make sure you snap the scene from different angles. You can’t take too many photographs, but you can certainly take too few.  3) Don’t Admit Guilt  Admitting guilt to eyewitnesses and at-fault parties can weaken your case, so avoid any comments that could be interpreted this way. Don’t apologize or express a sense of guilt. It’s also best to keep the experience off of social media. Tweets and blog posts can be used against you in court. It’s best to limit your communication to the absolute minimum lest you accidentally harm your chances in a personal injury trial.  4) Make Sure the Police Take Your Statement  Almost 40% of police reports don’t include a statement from the pedestrian, particularly if they’re sent to urgent care. The police must record your version of events. Your voice matters, so don’t be afraid to question the police report. This paperwork can be amended to reflect the situation more accurately. Call a lawyer if the officer refuses to take your statement or fix inaccuracies.  5) Start Making an Insurance Claim  Once you’ve dealt with the urgent aspects of your collision, it’s time to phone the driver’s insurance company to launch a claim. It’s best to limit your narrative to the essential facts, no matter how much they pressure you into providing more details. You’re not required to disclose facts about your medical care, police report, or partial fault.  6) Keep Track of Follow-Up Care  The more detailed your medical care is, the stronger your case will be, so go to all your recommended follow-up appointments. Request diagnostics if necessary. Keep an ongoing record of your medical bills and transportation costs. If you miss time off work, add your lost income to your records. These details will ultimately go to an insurer, but it’s best to seek legal advice before you hand them over.  Personal injury settlements can be difficult to secure without legal help. Insurers and at-fault parties are notorious for low-balling victims, but you can build a successful case with the right assistance. You need someone in your corner, no matter how strong or resourceful you are."

State police said the bear was crossing the southbound lanes of I-85 about two miles north of the DeWitt exit when the driver of a sports-utility vehicle slammed on the brakes to avoid hitting it. Another SUV, however, was not so fortunate and wound up hitting both the bear and the back of the first SUV.  No one inside either vehicle was injured. Witnesses told state police the bear ran away from the scene.  Earlier Monday, Petersburg Police reported a bear sighting near the Henry William Townhouses at the intersection of Lee Avenue and South Street. Authorities were encouraging anyone who may see the bear not to approach it and instead call police at (804) 732-4222 or the Virginia Department of Games and Inland Fisheries at (804) 367-1000.  A Petersburg Police spokesperson told The Progress-Index no other sightings were reported in the city.  Black bears are a common sight anywhere in Virginia, according to the state Department of Wildlife Resources. While seen sporadically along the coast, a DWF map indicates these animals can be found most anywhere in the state because they adapt so easily to their surroundings.  “They prefer habitats that provide cover, such as a densely wooded mature oak forests or swampy area in the coastal plain, and easily accessible food resources,” the DWF website said.  The National Park Service says black bears are far less aggressive than brown or any other type of bear and will usually avoid human contact. However, authorities remind people that despite their temperment, black bears still are wild animals and could attack if provoked. Therefore, it is wise to let a black bear alone should you see one.

So famous, it actually got a revamp for the likes of Vanguard and Modern Warfare 2 (where it was set on a ship).  Its somewhat simple design, which sees a collection of vacant containers for players to shoot their way around, is a mainstay of the series. However, the original map nearly didn't make its way into Call of Duty at all. As hard as it is to imagine now, Shipment's inclusion in 2007's Modern Warfare was ""truly an accident"".  Watch on YouTube Here is Shipment in 2022's Modern Warfare 2.  Speaking to Dexerto, Infinity Ward multiplayer design director Geoff Smith shared more backstory on Shipment's genesis.  ""There's little happy experiments. Things that worked out, things that didn't work out for whatever reason,"" Smith said, before admitting Shipment is the ""bane of his existence"".  Smith stated the map was originally conceived with split-screen in mind, and the team at Infinity Ward used Shipment for internal tests. It was then included in the broader ""playlist script"" for Modern Warfare, but the developer ""forgot"" to remove it before the game's final release.  After that, there was ""no going back,"" Smith recalled.  It is hard to imagine Call of Duty without Shipment. Even those with only a vague familiarity with the series can often name it as one of the franchise's maps. While it may have been included by accident, at least the end result was a happy one.  After all, we are now 16 years on from its first iteration, and here I am still writing about it."

Share Copy Link Copy  Hide Transcript Show Transcript  Leo played it perfect tone which was, he's shivering. He could barely form the words, he knows he's gonna die. We've already seen that. He's made *** sacrifice for her. Of course, very controversial. You know, that he could have gotten on the, on the, the, the raft with her, but he saw that it would have compromised her safety and he kind of steps back. He did what the gentleman on the ship did. I was happy when I wrote that scene, I'll be back, I'll be back. So that, that's *** funny thing because in the script, it, it actually read, I think I'll come back and there was something about the way Arnold said it with his then quite thick Austrian accent. That didn't sound quite right. And so I said, well, just switch it to, I'll be back, you know, and he said, really? I said, yeah, and we just kind of, you know, made it up, made it up in the moment and of course, it became quite iconic. But here's the interesting thing about that line. You're watching the movie for the first time, you have no idea what's gonna happen next. And yet it still got *** laugh somehow people had gotten already. This guy was this bulldozer. You just get this innate sense of this guy as just this juggernaut. And when he says I'll be back, it's gonna be bad. So people laughed before they even knew they didn't even know what *** Terminator movie was at that point. Well, I think they were starting to figure it out. Come with me if you want to live. Terminator Two. That's the pivotal moment where Sarah has this stunning realization that the Terminator that's before her, her worst nightmare has turned into her savior and the savior of her son. And it was just *** fun moment to see how Linda would play that. We knew it was *** tough moment for her because her whole reality literally flips upside down. She played it beautifully. It's just *** nice piece of acting chicken. Oh, it's *** pure moment of exultation for him. He's just alive. He's in the moment he doesn't have *** penny in his pocket. He won the damn ticket in *** poker game. He's just living carefree fancy free. He's met Fabrizio and they're just having fun. It was an expression of life, his life spirit, which seems so unquenchable and so full of potential. Every time I'm aching by, I'm getting ready to do *** run. I'm, I'm talking to Leo on the radio. Ok. Howl, like *** wolf. You know, I got him howling like *** wolf. We tried it, you know, I don't know, 10 times and he looked great and his, his acting spirit was there, but we just couldn't quite find the right word and it just popped into my head. I said, just say, I'm the king of the world. I hear back on the lucky what I said, you gotta sell it, you gotta sell it. You know, just say I'm the king of the world and he did and he put his arms out and you feel that spirit and it became the focal point of the whole scene, the whole ship's energy, the pounding of the engines, the dolphins jumping and everything, all, you know, the sort of the beauty and the power and the majesty of it all culminated to his, his spirit at the, at the bow. Now I come along at the Academy Awards and make the classic mistake of assuming that just because we had won best picture or that, that I got be best director that everybody in the room loved the movie and would celebrate *** reference to the movie, but they weren't, not everybody voted for it, right? And the knives are always, they're, they're kind of always half drawn even when they're there to celebrate you. The knife is half out of the, out of the, the hilt. I mean out of the, the sheath, right? Yeah. So I put my foot in that one, Jack. I want you to draw me like one of your French girls, *** lot of people have, have kind of mocked and spoofed that line. But I think *** lot of people really like it. She's bold. She's taking the power. She's been robbed of power by her fiance, by her mother, by her social straitjacket. He's this devil may care, free spirit, artistic spirit, all the things that she wants to be and she just flips the script and tells him to do his thing. I think people celebrate her empowerment as *** character in, in that moment, it's also the promise of romance, the promise of sex. It's also this great liberation and it's my 40 something year old hand as Leo's 20 year old hand. But I do the, the picture and then Leo just made some head scratching, you know, while he was fiercely concentrating on, on her and pretending to draw. The only problem is I draw left handed and he was madly drawn way right handed. I should have made *** draw left handed. When you sketch, there's an arc that's formed by your wrist. So all my lines are arching in this direction. Now, I've got to do the drawing backwards. So if you look in the movie, I'm doing the outlining, but I'm not doing any of the shading. I'm doing the smudging cause I couldn't do it because the arcs were all the wrong, wrong direction. I don't know about you, but I intend to write *** strongly worded letter to the White Star line about all this. I just think people appreciate Jack's presence of mind to be taking the stress out of the situation for her by making *** joke. And Leo played it perfect tone which was, he's shivering. He can barely form the words. He knows he's gonna die. We've already seen that he's made *** sacrifice for her, of course, very controversial. You know, that he could have gotten on the, on the, the, the raft with her, but he saw that it would have compromised her safety and he kind of steps back. He did what the gentleman on the ship did when they stepped back from the life boats to save the women and Children first because that was honor and duty. I was happy when I wrote that scene. Get away from her. You ***. That's *** great uh iconic moment. The moment we knew we had them was then they just burst into wild applause on that line. They loved it. So we knew the movie had had landed. And then you realize this movie is about two females of different species, protecting their young and it's on, it was just the right line at the right time in that movie. And then the audience response to it reminded me why you do this. I was *** marine. Hey, yeah, *** warrior of the jarhead clan. My brother Dave uh was *** marine. He died recently and you go your whole life as *** marine. Jake doesn't matter where he goes in the universe if he was *** US marine at some point, he's *** marine. Only *** marine can call himself *** jarhead unless they're *** marine. In which case it's ok. So that was just *** little inside kind of marine corps reference. I put ***, I put *** few of them in, you know, kind of for my brother Dave who's *** guy that I really loved and admired. I see here, I see you, I see you as *** very important line. It resonates for people *** lot just popped into my head while I was writing the treatment in 95. And it's like, what would *** navy greeting be? You're walking towards somebody and I see you, you know, I basically kind of the simplicity of it, right? And then it started to take on various layers of meaning as I thought, well, what do people really want? They want to be seen? They want to be acknowledged, they want to be recognized, they want to be respected, they wanna be loved seeing it. It took on *** deeper meaning. Jake's kind of struggling with the idea. But of course, the whole movie is about that. The movie starts with him opening his eyes and it ends with him opening, he has woken up to *** greater experience of the world to *** deeper understanding. He's the only human that's ever truly understood the navi from their perspective and he inhabits as his avatar, he inhabits their world. And of course, he's learning from this woman that he's falling in love with. I think you're never more open than when you're falling in love with somebody that can teach you something. And so I see you took on many meanings. You know, I understand you, I acknowledge you, I respect you, I love you. There's the top layer of the movie which is plot and character. And then there's the second layer of the movie, which is thematic, right? Which is about themes of indigenous culture and human civilization, kind of at war with itself, you know, pulling us away from our connection to nature and all those, all those things. But there's another layer, there's *** tertiary layer which is mystical. If we don't service that layer as well, then we're not really doing *** worthy sequel or worthy Sequels to the first film. It continues to be important to ask the audience to see kind of with better eyes, some of the things that are, you know, our problems and our world. I mean, Avatar doesn't pretend to have some great solution. It's just saying, you know, our our our human journey is is very troubled right now. This is our whole, this is our family, this is our fortress. I question it. As I go along spending five years on essentially one ip one, you know, it's, it's 2.5 movies that we've been working on over the last last five years. You know, I question it and then I start seeing the results and then it's *** no brainer at that point. Then it just all comes to life and that world comes to life and you see the characters come to life. It's kind of magical. You know, sometimes I have to pinch myself when I see the end result of the process. So you just have to have faith in the process as you, as you go along. I knew I wanted to tell *** family story. I wanted to as an artist express some of the, the things, the ideas, the feelings that I had as *** parent and that I had observed in my kids and I'd done sort of parent child stories in the past, even all the way back to, to aliens and uh Terminator Two, but I hadn't lived it. There was *** lot of uh sort of great dramatic grist for the mill there uh around the dysfunction of families. But how there's *** strength at the core of families that helps get people through times are all in this highly angst ridden, highly anxious time. Right now. I wanted to within *** fantasy world show, special to *** young audience. It's ok even in even, you know, 200 years from now on *** distant planet, you know, kids are still gonna feel anxious or, or, or depressed or, or unseen, it's ok. You know, I'm just not only channeling my experience as *** parent, but my experience as *** teenager myself. And I just thought that that foundation of universal human experience put into the most far flung fantasy environment that you can imagine grounds it emotionally.

Instead, they made a simple assumption: that any violence against a left-wing protester is justified on its face. Perry had lived out the right-wing fantasy of lethal violence in defense of “order.” By their lights, he had done nothing wrong.  Prominent conservatives have taken the same view of Daniel Penny, the 24-year-old assailant in the killing of Jordan Neely in a New York City subway car this month. What we know is that Neely, who was homeless, was erratic and acting hostile toward other passengers. Witnesses said he had not attacked anyone. At some point, Penny, a former Marine, placed Neely in a chokehold, which killed him. Two other passengers restrained Neely while he struggled on the ground. Penny is now charged with second-degree manslaughter.  We don’t know much, yet, about Penny’s mind-set or motivation during his confrontation on the subway. But this has not stopped conservatives from valorizing him in the same way they valorized Rittenhouse and Perry. “The Marine who stepped in to protect others is a hero,” said Greene, now a congresswoman. The decision to charge Penny, said the Fox News host Greg Gutfeld, was “pro-criminal” and “anti-hero.”  In a testament to conservative enthusiasm for Penny, an online fund-raiser has raised more than $2 million for his legal defense. And DeSantis, now angling for the Republican presidential nomination, stepped in with a message of support. “We must defeat the Soros-Funded DAs, stop the Left’s pro-criminal agenda, and take back the streets for law abiding citizens,” he said on Twitter. “We stand with Good Samaritans like Daniel Penny. Let’s show this Marine … America’s got his back.”  It’s the same language, the same tropes, the same ideas. In listening to conservative fans of Rittenhouse, Perry and Penny, you would never know that there were actual people on the other side of these confrontations. You would never know that those people were, in life, entitled to the protection of the law and that they are, in death, entitled to a full account of the last moments of their lives, with legal responsibility for the men who killed them, if that’s what a jury decides."

Where some might see monotony, Shattuck saw opportunity. There was something about the feel of that first plastic set of clubs in his hands. Something about the challenge of firing to an imaginary pin. Something about the game that gripped him early and never let go.  ""He was obsessed with (golf),"" Scott Shattuck said of his son. ""We had to almost drag him inside the house.""  So yes, Shattuck always believed there was a chance he'd make it to the sport's biggest stage. Yet the 4-year-old who took delight in tearing up his parents' yard deep into the twilight couldn't have imagined the circuitous route that brought the now-28-year-old to the 2023 PGA Championship.  The 12-footer for par that Shattuck drained to win the PGA Professional Championship in New Mexico last month assured him of a spot in the strongest field of the year starting Thursday at Oak Hill.  It also served as a testament to the relentlessness of a self-professed grinder who was forced to rebuild his swing from the ground up following a car accident in 2019 that resulted in multiple herniated disks in his lower back and made even walking difficult.  The player who would spend 12 hours a day during the summer as a kid pounding ball after ball on the practice range spent the better part of two years watching the guys he competed with on the mini-tour circuit climb the ladder while he went through countless hours of physical therapy and wondered if he'd ever be able to swing something close to pain-free again.  ""Physically you can't even play golf, and mentally it's tough because now what else do you do with your time,"" Shattuck said. ""It took a lot to get over that hurdle.""  So Shattuck poured himself into his work as an assistant golf pro, showing others how to fix their swings while trying to devise a way to tweak his own.  ""It was more of an experiment than anything,"" he said. ""I knew what exactly in my golf swing hurt, so I figured if I could do something with my setup and my golf swing to take some pressure off of those areas, that even if I didn't fully heal that maybe I could still swing a golf club with minimal pain.""  After a two-year sabbatical, his game slowly returned, though not quite the same as before. A more upright stance cost him some distance with his irons, though he has compensated by finding a few more yards with his driver. And the days of planting himself at the range for hours on end are long gone.  The pain is manageable, at least most of the time. He abandoned Korn Ferry Tour qualifying after the first round last fall when his back flared up out of nowhere. His preparation includes a series of stretching exercises and twice-weekly visits to a physical therapist, all of it tinged with just a hint of uncertainty when he wakes up in the morning.  Shattuck is confident his back and his game are in good enough shape to make the cut this weekend. Asking for anything beyond that, at least for now, is just being greedy.  While the vast majority of the 156-man field plays golf for a living, Shattuck remains primarily a teacher. The morning after he got back from his victory in New Mexico — a win that earned Shattuck $60,000, a berth into the PGA and an exemption into six events in the 2024 season — he was back at Rolling Green Golf Club in Springfield, about 15 miles west of downtown Philadelphia.  There were slices to fix. Hooks to solve. A love for the game to impart the way his father did to him as a kid. The younger Shattuck was 14 when he beat his father for the first time, shooting a 67 from the back tees at The Golf Course at Glen Mills while the adults in the group turned to his father with eyebrows raised.  ""Braden would go around (with us) and (they'd) be like, 'Damn, this kid can play,'"" Scott Shattuck said with a laugh.  Sure, his son would prefer to play with a back that doesn't require so much maintenance. Yet the unwanted sabbatical brought on by the car accident also shifted Shattuck's perspective.  ""I had a little bit more of an intense outlook when I was younger,"" he said. ""Now I just feel a lot more fortunate to be out here. I feel like I'm playing with house money so it feels more relaxed.""  At least until he stands on the tee at 7 a.m. on Thursday as part of the first group out on the East Course, a moment that seemed so far away when he was tearing up the backyard as a kid — and even farther during his long recovery following the accident — finally at hand.  Maybe the nerves he fended off during the arduous process of getting here will make a brief appearance. He's not sure.  ""That's a great question,"" he said with a laugh. ""I think we're all going to find out the answer to that one at the same time."""

The incident occurred at around 2 a.m. on Sunday, May 14th on US 287 in Wichita Falls, Texas.  According to News Channel 6, a semi truck crashed through a grassy median along US 287 and and overturned, blocking the northbound lanes and much of the southbound lanes. The overturned semi truck then caused another wreck involving two box trucks, but no one was seriously hurt in either accident.  “You’ve got a semi truck that’s overturned blocking the entire north bound lane and into the southbound lanes as well. You got another accident that’s occurred already, I think maybe both had actually occurred and because people on the south bound lane tried to stop,” said Sheriff Duke, who responded to the wreck.  After the initial wrecks, Good Samaritans on the southbound side decided to pull over and try to help, and that’s when they were fatally struck by another vehicle. Duke says that, while stopping to help is appreciated, the safety of the situation should be assessed before stopping.  “Your life has got to be there Safety first before you can save someone else’s life, and so obviously call in locations, vehicles, what they see, if they saw multiple victims, anything,” said Sheriff Duke. “If they can park in that area where they’re safe, where no traffic is going to run over them, then they can get out and help and leave their emergency hazard lights on.”  “They’re not immune to being hit by people driving with their cellphones in their face and they’re just not paying attention, it just happens,” said Sheriff Duke. “But they need to put their emergency hazards on and either get past the accident and get in a safe area they can stop in and come back up on the shoulder of the road just to avoid traffic.”  The incident is still under investigation."

(Photo by Megan Vande Voort)  Seaplane accidents, while few, represent an area of general aviation where targeted training could pay real dividends.  That’s the takeaway from a new seaplane accident analysis report by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association Air Safety Institute (ASI).  Funded in part by the Seaplane Pilots Association, the Seaplane Accident Analysis Report 2008 – 2022 offers a detailed accident analysis, addressing flight conditions, fleet composition, accident causes, NTSB findings, and more.  The report also includes recommendations to reduce the number of accidents, including several training tips.  “Seaplanes are highly capable and uniquely suited for a wide variety of operations, but seaplane flying carries additional risk — due to the environment in which they operate — when not flown safely by proficient seaplane pilots,” says Robert Geske, AOPA Air Safety Institute manager of aviation safety analysis.  During the report period, 2008 to 2022, there were 406 seaplane accidents, with 77 ending in fatalities, he reports.  “For reference, general aviation accidents during the same period averaged 1,200 to 1,500 with 200 ending in a fatality,” he says. “The seaplane fleet makes up less than 5% of all general aviation aircraft, so understanding these types of accidents is valuable to the seaplane community.”  This report is also important as getting data has been increasingly difficult since the FAA began “repressing” seaplane activity data in 2015 “due to unreliable reporting and analysis.”  “For example, few seaplane aircraft operators report their hours. In addition, aircraft that switch out floats for other landing gear — as the season dictates — make reporting more difficult,” it continues.  The limited availability of seaplane flight hours and activity prevents a rate-based analysis of seaplane accidents. It also prevents “a meaningful year-to-year comparison and understanding of whether the rise and fall of accidents is attributed to flight activity or to an actual change,” the report notes.  With all that said, the report finds that one factor dominates the cause of seaplane accidents: Abnormal runway contact (ARC).  “This is best thought of as a landing surface contact since seaplanes do not need to operate from a paved runway surface,” according to the report. “These types of accidents occur mainly during landing (90%), with many resulting from gear-down water landings.”  The report recommends that a “broader adoption and installation of gear warning systems that aid in identifying the landing surface should reduce accidents in this category.”  It also suggests more participation by pilots in the Seaplane Pilots Association’s “Positive rate, gear up” campaign.  Loss of control in flight (LOC-I) is the deadliest cause of seaplane accidents.  “Given seaplanes’ unique operating environment, the maneuvering phase is where most of these accidents occur,” the report notes.  “Dedicated efforts targeted at low-speed awareness, distraction prevention, and positive aircraft control could drive down the frequency of fatal accidents,” it continues. “Seaplane pilots may also benefit from the installation and use of angle of attack indicators.”  It also notes that the installation of gear warning and advisory systems, which work to identify the landing surface and inform pilots of proper surface or water gear configuration, may drastically reduce nose-over events.  “While not as deadly as LOC-I, reducing the volume of accidents would, most likely, positively impact the cost and availability of insurance,” the report states.  The report concludes with a number of recommendations, including additional training, specifically in aircraft control, loss of control prevention, gear configuration, and operations during maneuvering.  One of the big issues with seaplane training are gaps in flying and training, according to the report, which notes that many pilots swap floats for skis or wheels as the seasons change.  “Seaplane pilots may experience six or more months away from seaplane operations, a situation that hinders their proficiency and impacts their training. Pilots who experience gaps due to seasonality need to take added precautions when resuming seaplane operations. Combating these gaps through a training course could help mitigate proficiency-related accidents.”  Another critical area for increased training is in decisionmaking, which was cited by the NTSB as a key contributor to seaplane accidents.  “Safety starts and ends with good decisions,” the report noted. “Reminding pilots of the effect their choices have on the outcome of the flight and helping them understand how to mitigate risks will further reduce all GA accidents.”  You can read the full report at AOPA.org/Training-and-Safety/Air-Safety-Institute/Accident-Analysis/Seaplane-Accident-Report."

Strickland was 50 on June 28, 2019, when she shot McWaters at the home they rented at 773 Target Road, just outside of Holly Hill.  There’s no debate as to whether Strickland shot and killed McWaters, but there is as to whether it was an accident or murder.  Strickland’s murder trial got underway Tuesday with 1st Circuit Assistant Solicitor David Osborne telling the jury that the killing was intentional, not any type of accident.  Osborne told the jury that McWaters was a long-time alcoholic.  “He was drinking himself to an early grave, but it should’ve been God’s call when Robert’s time on Earth was over,” he said.  Osborne claims Strickland couldn’t have accidentally shot McWaters because of the multiple safety features that were on gun used in the killing.  He also said Strickland initially told law enforcement officers that McWaters came at her, so she fired the gun at him.  The bullet struck him in his right temple.  Strickland later told investigators that McWaters challenged her knowledge of firearms.  She told investigators that she retrieved her son’s pistol from a dresser drawer in the extra bedroom.  Video of Strickland’s interview with investigators was played for the jury.  In it, she told Orangeburg County Sheriff’s Office Lt. James Shumpert that she was holding the gun and McWaters said, “You don’t know how to do it” as he sat on a chair at the kitchen table.  “I’m holding the gun. I didn’t know how to take it (the safeties) off, but I got it off,” she said.  She claims the gun accidentally discharged.  She put the gun back in its holster, according to authorities, before she called 911.  Defense attorney Jack Swerling told the jury that even though McWaters and Strickland’s relationship “was volatile and contentious, there was mutual feeling between each other. That’s why they stayed together.”  “She had no intention of leaving” the relationship, Swerling said.  The jury heard testimony that there had been a couple of calls for law enforcement to respond to the home previously concerning domestic disputes.  In one call, Strickland told responding Deputy Donald Huffman that McWaters kept waking her up while she tried to sleep.  Video footage from Huffman’s body camera was played for the jury.  Huffman told Strickland to consider going to a magistrate’s office to try to get the eviction process started to have McWaters leave.  Strickland never sought McWaters’ eviction.  Some of the witnesses the state called on Tuesday include:  Officer Michael Mann, who was employed by the Holly Hill Police Department at the time of the killing.  He was the first officer to respond to the residence at the request of the Orangeburg County Sheriff’s Office.  The jury watched Mann’s body camera video recording at the scene.  They saw Strickland was overcome with emotion and crying when Mann arrived at the house.  She was outside while using her phone and pointed to the inside of the home.  Orangeburg County Sheriff’s Office Deputy Roman Rodriguez, the first deputy to arrive on the scene.  Officer Joseph Henry Daugherty, Strickland’s ex-husband. Daugherty formerly worked at the Holly Hill Police Department, but wasn’t an officer there when McWaters was killed.  Daugherty testified that Strickland called him and told him that she’d “hurt” McWaters.  He told Strickland to call 911. He claims that she told him she did call 911, but no one answered.  Daugherty said he then called the Orangeburg County Sheriff’s Office dispatch number to report what Strickland told him.  Bruce Owens, of Holly Hill, testified that he let McWaters and Strickland rent the mobile home he had at 773 Target Road.  Owens told the jury that he’d known the McWaters family for a number of years.  He told the jury that McWaters wasn’t employed and was an alcoholic.  He also told them that Strickland was employed at tried to make ends meet in the household, but they didn’t always pay their rent on time.  Orangeburg County Sheriff’s Office Lt. William McCormick told the jury about photos he took at the crime scene, which included the shell casing from the bullet that was fired, the holstered firearm and various interior views of the home.  The trial will resume on Tuesday at 9:30 a.m. The trial is expected to last three or four days.  Circuit Judge Diane Goodstein is presiding."

(CBS 58) -- An Oconomowoc family is advocating for safer bike paths after their daughter and sister, Sarah Debbink Langenkamp, was killed in an accident in August 2022.  Langenkamp was biking in Bethesda, Maryland when the driver of a semi-truck hit and killed her while turning right into a parking lot.  ""All that white line is, is an invitation. It's a death trap to bicyclists who think they're safe because they're in a bike lane,"" Dirk Debbink, Langenkamp's father, said.  Langenkamp's family immediately channeled their pain into action by gaining the attention of U.S. lawmakers who sponsored the Sarah Debbink Langenkamp Active Transportation Act.  ""It can't bring Sarah back, but over 1,000 people are killed every year, bicyclists and pedestrians in our country -- but can we make a 5% difference? That's 50 people. Ten percent? That's 100 people that don't have to go through this,"" Debbink said.  The bill would allocate existing federal funding to allow state and local government to build safer pathways for bicyclists and pedestrians.  ""Every day the dollars sit there and not out here, it's another day somebody else could get killed,"" Debbink said.  The Oconomowoc Common Council voted unanimously to support the Sarah Debbink Langenkamp Active Transportation Act on Tuesday.  ""We're going to do our best to help this tragedy become something positive,"" Oconomowoc Mayor Robert Magnus said.  Magnus and the Common Council are sending the Debbink family off to Washington D.C. with their signed letter of support.  Langenkamp's parents, Dirk and Terry Debbink, are meeting with lawmakers, including Sen. Ron Johnson and Sen. Tammy Baldwin on Wednesday.  ""We're all in. Let's make a difference if we can,"" Dirk Debbink said.  Langenkamp's family told CBS 58 she learned how to ride a bike in Oconomowoc where she grew up. Her passion for biking carried her throughout the world in countries like Uganda and Ukraine, where she served as a U.S. diplomat.  ""She loved biking and really committed to commuting by bike in whatever country she was working in,"" Alicia Bosscher, Langenkamp's sister, said.  Debbink said lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have the chance to come together to support safer biking in communities across the country."

He also revealed that wife Angela had a feeling that something bad was going to happen to Ava.  ""The hard part of it is that my wife really listens to her intuitions and she actually on Thursday bought everyone into the kitchen and told everyone, 'I have a feeling my daughter is going to the ER this week. Do not let her do anything that she can get hurt doing.'""  Alfonso Ribeiro/Instagram, Joce zerojack/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images  Ribeiro added, ""That obviously wasn't listened to.

""How long has your wife been a psychic?,"" asked Ripa, to which Ribeiro responded, ""Unfortunately, most of her life. She very rarely gets things wrong and sees things coming. You don't always listen to that feeling, and I think that all mothers have that beautiful intuition.""  ""That was very specific but all mothers have that intuition,"" he continued. ""You carry this soul around in your body for nine months; there is a connection that men can never understand that women have with their babies. And she felt something that unfortunately everyone didn't abide by that information.""  The Dancing with the Stars co-host and Angela first revealed last Friday that their daughter had emergency surgery after falling off her sit-down scooter.  ""Not the kind of day you want the day before turning 4,"" wrote Ribeiro alongside a photo showing Ava's injuries.  ""Just want to give a heartfelt thank you to @kareskinmd for the emergency service and procedure to help lessen the likelihood of scaring. So proud of how brave my baby girl was during the surgery,"" he added.  Ribeiro and Angela share Ava and sons Alfonso ""AJ"" Lincoln, 9, and Anders Reyn, 8.

The incident took place about midnight on Monday at the intersection of Newark Avenue and Coles Street. According to authorities, a male in his thirties was hurt in the collision.    The car that hit him fled the scene, and officers made no mention of the vehicle’s make or model. Authorities added that the victim was rushed to an area hospital, where he remains in serious but stable condition.  The prosecutor’s office requests that anybody with knowledge of the accident contact them. An investigation remains ongoing in the meantime.    Our thoughts are with the injured victim and his family at this time. We hope for his full recovery.  Pedestrian Accident Injuries in New Jersey  According to the most recent available accident statistics, a pedestrian was killed in a traffic collision in New Jersey 27% of the time over the last year alone.  Tragically, any pedestrian in New Jersey who is out for a stroll runs the risk of being in a collision. But some age groups see more traffic-related fatalities than others. For instance, adults over the age of 65 make up about 20% of all pedestrian accident fatalities. What’s more, New Jersey ranked among the top states for pedestrian deaths and injuries.  The busy streets in New Jersey clearly pose a threat to pedestrians, but the state has passed several laws that drivers must abide by to keep pedestrians safe. Drivers that break these prohibitions may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, particularly if a pedestrian is hurt. Drivers in New Jersey have a duty of care to pedestrians, and when they fail to uphold this responsibility, they may be held civilly accountable. Although pedestrians frequently sustain injuries in accidents, you have the right to use the road safely as a pedestrian in New Jersey.  At any time and at every intersection, pedestrians have the right to cross the roadway safely while walking on the sidewalk. Drivers are accountable for maintaining awareness of their surroundings and treating every other vehicle—including bicycles, trucks, and pedestrians—with respect. People’s disregard for others causes these awful accidents. You don’t have to go through this ordeal by yourself. You need to seek the assistance of a New Jersey pedestrian accident attorney.  If you have a Jersey City pedestrian accident lawyer on your side, your chances of winning your personal injury case will be greatly boosted.

Share Copy Link Copy  Hide Transcript Show Transcript  Leo played it perfect tone which was, he's shivering. He could barely form the words, he knows he's gonna die. We've already seen that. He's made *** sacrifice for her. Of course, very controversial. You know, that he could have gotten on the, on the, the, the raft with her, but he saw that it would have compromised her safety and he kind of steps back. He did what the gentleman on the ship did. I was happy when I wrote that scene, I'll be back, I'll be back. So that, that's *** funny thing because in the script, it, it actually read, I think I'll come back and there was something about the way Arnold said it with his then quite thick Austrian accent. That didn't sound quite right. And so I said, well, just switch it to, I'll be back, you know, and he said, really? I said, yeah, and we just kind of, you know, made it up, made it up in the moment and of course, it became quite iconic. But here's the interesting thing about that line. You're watching the movie for the first time, you have no idea what's gonna happen next. And yet it still got *** laugh somehow people had gotten already. This guy was this bulldozer. You just get this innate sense of this guy as just this juggernaut. And when he says I'll be back, it's gonna be bad. So people laughed before they even knew they didn't even know what *** Terminator movie was at that point. Well, I think they were starting to figure it out. Come with me if you want to live. Terminator Two. That's the pivotal moment where Sarah has this stunning realization that the Terminator that's before her, her worst nightmare has turned into her savior and the savior of her son. And it was just *** fun moment to see how Linda would play that. We knew it was *** tough moment for her because her whole reality literally flips upside down. She played it beautifully. It's just *** nice piece of acting chicken. Oh, it's *** pure moment of exultation for him. He's just alive. He's in the moment he doesn't have *** penny in his pocket. He won the damn ticket in *** poker game. He's just living carefree fancy free. He's met Fabrizio and they're just having fun. It was an expression of life, his life spirit, which seems so unquenchable and so full of potential. Every time I'm aching by, I'm getting ready to do *** run. I'm, I'm talking to Leo on the radio. Ok. Howl, like *** wolf. You know, I got him howling like *** wolf. We tried it, you know, I don't know, 10 times and he looked great and his, his acting spirit was there, but we just couldn't quite find the right word and it just popped into my head. I said, just say, I'm the king of the world. I hear back on the lucky what I said, you gotta sell it, you gotta sell it. You know, just say I'm the king of the world and he did and he put his arms out and you feel that spirit and it became the focal point of the whole scene, the whole ship's energy, the pounding of the engines, the dolphins jumping and everything, all, you know, the sort of the beauty and the power and the majesty of it all culminated to his, his spirit at the, at the bow. Now I come along at the Academy Awards and make the classic mistake of assuming that just because we had won best picture or that, that I got be best director that everybody in the room loved the movie and would celebrate *** reference to the movie, but they weren't, not everybody voted for it, right? And the knives are always, they're, they're kind of always half drawn even when they're there to celebrate you. The knife is half out of the, out of the, the hilt. I mean out of the, the sheath, right? Yeah. So I put my foot in that one, Jack. I want you to draw me like one of your French girls, *** lot of people have, have kind of mocked and spoofed that line. But I think *** lot of people really like it. She's bold. She's taking the power. She's been robbed of power by her fiance, by her mother, by her social straitjacket. He's this devil may care, free spirit, artistic spirit, all the things that she wants to be and she just flips the script and tells him to do his thing. I think people celebrate her empowerment as *** character in, in that moment, it's also the promise of romance, the promise of sex. It's also this great liberation and it's my 40 something year old hand as Leo's 20 year old hand. But I do the, the picture and then Leo just made some head scratching, you know, while he was fiercely concentrating on, on her and pretending to draw. The only problem is I draw left handed and he was madly drawn way right handed. I should have made *** draw left handed. When you sketch, there's an arc that's formed by your wrist. So all my lines are arching in this direction. Now, I've got to do the drawing backwards. So if you look in the movie, I'm doing the outlining, but I'm not doing any of the shading. I'm doing the smudging cause I couldn't do it because the arcs were all the wrong, wrong direction. I don't know about you, but I intend to write *** strongly worded letter to the White Star line about all this. I just think people appreciate Jack's presence of mind to be taking the stress out of the situation for her by making *** joke. And Leo played it perfect tone which was, he's shivering. He can barely form the words. He knows he's gonna die. We've already seen that he's made *** sacrifice for her, of course, very controversial. You know, that he could have gotten on the, on the, the, the raft with her, but he saw that it would have compromised her safety and he kind of steps back. He did what the gentleman on the ship did when they stepped back from the life boats to save the women and Children first because that was honor and duty. I was happy when I wrote that scene. Get away from her. You ***. That's *** great uh iconic moment. The moment we knew we had them was then they just burst into wild applause on that line. They loved it. So we knew the movie had had landed. And then you realize this movie is about two females of different species, protecting their young and it's on, it was just the right line at the right time in that movie. And then the audience response to it reminded me why you do this. I was *** marine. Hey, yeah, *** warrior of the jarhead clan. My brother Dave uh was *** marine. He died recently and you go your whole life as *** marine. Jake doesn't matter where he goes in the universe if he was *** US marine at some point, he's *** marine. Only *** marine can call himself *** jarhead unless they're *** marine. In which case it's ok. So that was just *** little inside kind of marine corps reference. I put ***, I put *** few of them in, you know, kind of for my brother Dave who's *** guy that I really loved and admired. I see here, I see you, I see you as *** very important line. It resonates for people *** lot just popped into my head while I was writing the treatment in 95. And it's like, what would *** navy greeting be? You're walking towards somebody and I see you, you know, I basically kind of the simplicity of it, right? And then it started to take on various layers of meaning as I thought, well, what do people really want? They want to be seen? They want to be acknowledged, they want to be recognized, they want to be respected, they wanna be loved seeing it. It took on *** deeper meaning. Jake's kind of struggling with the idea. But of course, the whole movie is about that. The movie starts with him opening his eyes and it ends with him opening, he has woken up to *** greater experience of the world to *** deeper understanding. He's the only human that's ever truly understood the navi from their perspective and he inhabits as his avatar, he inhabits their world. And of course, he's learning from this woman that he's falling in love with. I think you're never more open than when you're falling in love with somebody that can teach you something. And so I see you took on many meanings. You know, I understand you, I acknowledge you, I respect you, I love you. There's the top layer of the movie which is plot and character. And then there's the second layer of the movie, which is thematic, right? Which is about themes of indigenous culture and human civilization, kind of at war with itself, you know, pulling us away from our connection to nature and all those, all those things. But there's another layer, there's *** tertiary layer which is mystical. If we don't service that layer as well, then we're not really doing *** worthy sequel or worthy Sequels to the first film. It continues to be important to ask the audience to see kind of with better eyes, some of the things that are, you know, our problems and our world. I mean, Avatar doesn't pretend to have some great solution. It's just saying, you know, our our our human journey is is very troubled right now. This is our whole, this is our family, this is our fortress. I question it. As I go along spending five years on essentially one ip one, you know, it's, it's 2.5 movies that we've been working on over the last last five years. You know, I question it and then I start seeing the results and then it's *** no brainer at that point. Then it just all comes to life and that world comes to life and you see the characters come to life. It's kind of magical. You know, sometimes I have to pinch myself when I see the end result of the process. So you just have to have faith in the process as you, as you go along. I knew I wanted to tell *** family story. I wanted to as an artist express some of the, the things, the ideas, the feelings that I had as *** parent and that I had observed in my kids and I'd done sort of parent child stories in the past, even all the way back to, to aliens and uh Terminator Two, but I hadn't lived it. There was *** lot of uh sort of great dramatic grist for the mill there uh around the dysfunction of families. But how there's *** strength at the core of families that helps get people through times are all in this highly angst ridden, highly anxious time. Right now. I wanted to within *** fantasy world show, special to *** young audience. It's ok even in even, you know, 200 years from now on *** distant planet, you know, kids are still gonna feel anxious or, or, or depressed or, or unseen, it's ok. You know, I'm just not only channeling my experience as *** parent, but my experience as *** teenager myself. And I just thought that that foundation of universal human experience put into the most far flung fantasy environment that you can imagine grounds it emotionally.

An online campaign raised tens of thousands of dollars, with many donations accompanied by wishes of a fast recovery for Mary Jane Mullen, a Lenape secretary for the past 61 years.  But the campaign’s tenor changed abruptly when Mullen, 79, died from her injuries Sunday.  More: Lenape team among the 15Which teams made our South Jersey Mean 15 softball rankings after the sixth week?  “The Lenape family suffered a profound loss today,” Tony Cattani, the school’s principal said in an update to the GoFundMe account after Mullen’s death.  “Mary Jane was the embodiment of all that is good in our world,” Cattani wrote.  Mary Jane Mullen spent her career at Lenape  “She felt a genuine love for all things Lenape, including students, staff, and alumni,” he said. “She was always ready with a hug, a kiss, and some candy for anyone who needed it.”  Mullen, a sophomore when Lenape opened in 1958, went to work for the school’s administration one month after graduating from Lenape in June 1961.  ""Her hiring forever changed Lenape High School,"" a statement from Lenape Regional School District said Tuesday.  Mullen sent thousands of personal notes  It described Mullen, who had led a student club for future secretaries, as ""the heart of Lenape High School.""  ""She approached each day with genuine love, kindness and caring,"" the statement said.  Over the decades, the Medford resident sent ""thousands upon thousands of personalized notes"" to students, staffers and Lenape family members, said Carol Birnbohm, the district's superintendent.  She said the notes delivered messages of encouragement, gratitude and love from Mullen, who also bought Christmas ornaments and other gifts for students and staff.  One note, written last month, described Lenape as Mullen's ""happy place.""  ""I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else. This is my home,"" it said.  Cattani said graduates who return to the school for reunion activities typically inquire about Mullen.  ""Without fail, the first thing they ask is, ‘Is Mary Jane still here?’”  A display of photos in Lenape's 1980 yearbook, Legend, shows Mullen surrounded by smiling students. A sketch depicts a harried secretary typing between wire baskets piled high with papers.  The headlines read “MJ Club” and “Mary Jane, Mary Jane, She’s Our Girl.”  Text with the photos describes Mullen as “bubbling with effervescence” and notes she “attracts all sorts to her office.”  GoFundMe appeal started on day of accident  A Lenape graduate launched the GoFundMe campaign on the day of Mullen's accident. It sought to help with Mullen’s medical costs and to support a scholarship fund in her honor.  According to Medford police, Mullen's car collided with another vehicle at Route 70 and North Main Street.  She was taken to the trauma center at Cooper University Hospital, Camden. The other driver had no reported injuries from the accident, which remains under investigation.  Mullen initially was in good spirits but still had “a long road ahead,” said the appeal, which had raised almost $50,000 by Wednesday evening.  The expressions of hope and affection turned somber on Sunday.  ""Mary Jane was a Saint to all who entered her Office Domain,"" wrote one donor, Daniel Archibald. ""She will be missed but hopefully her legacy survives.""  “MaryJane is (an) angel now and always has been,” said another donor, Susan Burns.  Cattani noted members of Burlington County’s school crisis response team and other school counselors were made available to students and staffers.  “I ask all of our members of the Lenape Family to look after one another as we deal with the loss of our friend and someone who truly exemplified Lenape High School,” the principal wrote.  He said the school ""will plan a special way to memorialize Mary Jane in the near future.""  Services will be held at St. Mary of the Lakes Church, 40 Jackson Road, Medford, where friends may call Wednesday from 6 to 9 p.m.  A Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated Thursday.  Burial will be private.  Jim Walsh is a senior reporter at the Courier-Post, Burlington County Times and The Daily Journal. Email him at jwalsh@cpsj.com."

The Utah Occupational Safety and Health Division “will not be investigating the fatality specifically but looking for any safety violations that could have caused or contributed to the cause of the accident,” Eric Olsen, communications director for the Utah Labor Commission, said Tuesday.  A statement from the Clearfield Police Department said Monday’s incident at Americold at 755 E. 1700 South is being investigated but that “initial information suggests this was a tragic accident.” The department didn’t name the 38-year-old man pending notification of extended family members.  The Clearfield incident is the 10th industrial death this year. “So far this year, including yesterday’s unfortunate event, there have been 10 workplace fatalities that fall under UOSH jurisdiction and are not attributed to preexisting conditions or sudden health problems such as heart attack,” Olsen said.  The man was somehow pinned between a forklift and freezer shelves, according to the Clearfield Police Department.  “First responders worked quickly and were able to free the victim from the entrapment and rendered some medical aid on scene in preparation for transport to the hospital,” said the police statement. But he had suffered “significant trauma to lower extremities” and died soon after reaching Holy Cross Hospital in Layton.  Newsletter"

You can see the cab of the truck which hit the Corvette transport is crushed, as are the cars on the end of the transport. According to the report, the transporter had merged onto I-64 and was getting up to speed, something which takes quite the distance for a laden truck, when the other semi ran into the back of it.  This sadly is a real danger when big trucks are merging onto freeways.

To tell the story of its accidental origin, you need to know why it's special in the first place. Ice wine, often written as one word ('icewine') in Canada, and known as 'eiswein' in its native land of Germany, is wine pressed from frozen grapes.  The flavor of grape juice comes from the various sugars, acids, and aromatic compounds it contains, but a majority of the juice (roughly 70-80%) is plain old water. When grapes are left on the vine in the winter snow, that water freezes and the flavorful compounds separate. Thus, when the grapes are finally juiced, the water content is far lower than usual, resulting in juice that is more like extremely concentrated grape syrup. After the mixture is fermented for a few months, you're left with one of the sweetest and most flavorful wines in existence. The results are rather magical, and it's all thanks to the ingenuity of German vintners, who adapted to sudden harsh conditions.  Ice "

Gaston Co- Lucia Riverbend Fire shared these pictures after two personal watercraft crashed on Mountain Island Lake sending five people to the hospital. The latest on the investigation and the injuries tonight on channel 9 eyewitness news at five. pic.twitter.com/0VNvjnyL8V — Dave Faherty (@FahertyWSOC9) May 15, 2023  NC Wildlife said the crash happened Sunday at the Riverbend Boat Landing on Eddie Nichols Drive shortly before 6:30 p.m.  The people on the Sea-Doos did not know each other, investigators said, and they don’t think drugs or alcohol were involved.  All five patients were taken to the hospital with injuries that varied from minor to severe. Investigators say there were two adults on one Sea-Doo and three juveniles on the other.  The Lucia-Riverbend Fire Department told Channel 9′s Dave Faherty they have already responded to four accidents on the lake over the last four weeks, including one drowning.  “When they’re out there riding, they’re riding erratically. And I say with due disregard, they’re just not really paying attention,” Fire Chief David Toomey said. “They’re just trying to have a good time and I understand that.”  The wreck comes one week after Willie Gray heard an out of control personal watercraft strike his dock at the home he’s lived in for more than 30 years.  “As you can see right now, it’s very calm, but on the weekends it gets crazy here,” Gray said. “And it’s still early in the season.”  Crews are urging people to make sure they use the kill switch on their personal watercraft and wear a flotation device when on the water. It’s something Tomas Suska knows all too well. He said five years ago, he was on a jet ski when he was struck and had to go to the hospital afterwards.  “Just got in a T-bone accident and didn’t have time to react. The guy was broken in two different places, so you just got to be very careful,” he said.  Faherty asked NC Wildlife about possible charges in the Sea-Doo crash they said the case remains under investigation.  This is a developing story, check back at wsoctv.com for updates.

(KMIZ)  A Cole County ATV crash left four kids in a Columbia hospital Sunday morning. Another man was seriously injured in Cooper County after an ATV crash Saturday. Two other reports of ATV crashes were recorded in the past week from Moniteau County and Randolph County.  An increase in off-road riders starts anytime temperatures rise, Cpl. Kyle Green with the Missouri State Highway Patrol said. But the chance of getting into an accident also grows.  “They're not toys at all,” Green added. “But that's the way many people view them.”  Last year alone, the Missouri State Highway Patrol recorded 284 total ATV crashes in the state. Over 70% of those resulted in injuries and 23 of those crashes were fatal. In many cases, Green said safety devices in the vehicle weren’t being used if they had them.  “That's unfortunately where we get many of these serious crashes,” Green said. “Where people aren't wearing helmets or they're not wearing the seatbelts and they get thrown out into the woods.”  At the same time, all-terrain vehicle crashes present a different problem for first responders. Cole County EMS said Sunday’s crash was in a remote location.  “ATVs present a little bit more of an operational issue for us,” Eric Hoy the Chief of Emergency Medical Services said. “We think there was a delay in activating 911 because they were in such a rural area that they had to get somewhere where they could actually call.”  Additionally, ambulances were not able to reach the scene alone. The EMS Incident Commander requested mutual aid for all-terrain transport vehicles from the Cole County Emergency Response Team, the Jefferson City Fire Department and Osage Ambulance District.  “It really limits the capabilities of the first responders,” Green said. “If you're going to be out on property that's in a hard-to-reach spot, hard to locate, then you need to let somebody know… in case something happens, at least we have an idea where to start searching.”  Driving an all-terrain vehicle impaired is just that too- impaired driving. In 2022, the Missouri State Highway Patrol recorded 50 ATV accidents caused by drinking or drugs.  “Operating these while impaired is dangerous for not only them but for the other people that are out on the roadways,” Green added.  In Missouri, there’s no set age to drive an all-terrain vehicle. While children under 18 must legally wear a helmet, they can drive freely on private property. In the same way, the Missouri State Highway Patrol warns it’s the parent’s responsibility to make sure the kid is ready “mentally and physically” to drive an ATV.  Wearing a helmet and seatbelt, if the vehicle has one, can decrease the chances of being injured in an ATV or UTV crash Green said. Letting someone know where you’re headed and having a way to contact 911 if needed can help emergency services get to you more quickly if needed.  Driving an ATV with the same mentality as driving a vehicle could help avoid an accident completely.  “Just be sure to take extra caution just like you would in your vehicle,” Hoy added.  Drivers can find more on ATV or UTV rules and regulations for Missouri here."
