"accident","2018-07-23","23:00:00","Not Discerned","2023-06-09T04:04:41","Days after a triple-train tragic accident in Odisha, a fire was spotted in an air-conditioned coach of Durg-Puri Express in the Nuapada district, causing panic among passengers, the East Coast Railway said in an official statement.  “Smoke was detected in the B3 coach of the train as the train reached the Khariar Road station on Thursday evening. The brake pads caught fire due to friction and incomplete release of brakes. The fire was confined to brake pads. There was no damage,"" the statement read.  The East Coast Railways informed that the problem was rectified in less than an hour and the train departed the station at 11 pm. No casualties were reported from the incident, however, it created panic among passengers and most of them rushed out of the train.  This came days after one of the worst train tragedies in the country at the Bahanaga Bazar station in Odisha’s Balasore district, which claimed over 270 lives and left more than 1,100 people injured after a crash involving Bengaluru-Howrah Superfast Express, Shalimar-Chennai Central Coromandel Express, and a goods train.  The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is currently investigating the Odisha train accident. The central agency was handed over the investigation as the Ministry of Railways was suspected tampering with the electronic interlocking system.  The preliminary investigation concluded that a “signaling error"" has caused the Odisha train accident. However, a senior Indian Railway official has disagreed with certain findings of the five-member inquiry committee.  Senior Section Engineer A.K. Mahanta gave a dissenting note to the report and said that the ‘datalogger’ report concludes that the signal was green for the main line, not the loop line.  “Based on observations from the data logger report the point was set for the normal side (main line). It may be reserved after derailment (sic),"" he said.  The Indian Railways has maintained that disagreements among the members during the preliminary stage of the investigation are common and something conclusive will only be revealed after a full inquiry by the commissioner of rail safety.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vbmV3cy9pbmRpYS9vZGlzaGEtZmlyZS1vbi1leHByZXNzLXRyYWluLWNyZWF0ZXMtcGFuaWMtYWZ0ZXItanVuZS0yLXRyaXBsZS10cmFpbi1hY2NpZGVudC0xMTY4NjI4MTc5NTA2My5odG1s0gGJAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9uZXdzL2luZGlhL29kaXNoYS1maXJlLW9uLWV4cHJlc3MtdHJhaW4tY3JlYXRlcy1wYW5pYy1hZnRlci1qdW5lLTItdHJpcGxlLXRyYWluLWFjY2lkZW50L2FtcC0xMTY4NjI4MTc5NTA2My5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"accident","2021-12-13","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-06-08T00:04:07","To  Smt Nirmala Sitharaman  Union Finance Minister  Dear Smt Sitharaman,  I refer to the hasty, sweeping Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSE) disinvestment policy announced by you in your Budget Speech in 2021 and further spelt out by the Department of Public Enterprises in their guidelines on 13-12-2021. As a sequel to it, Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM), functioning under your oversight, has embarked on a highly indiscriminate CPSE disinvestment drive, which lacks application of mind and vision. From what one has seen so far, DIPAM seems to be blissfully unaware of the antecedents of the bidders to whom it is selling away highly valuable CPSEs and their assets. The two recently aborted cases of Central Electronics Ltd (CEL) and Pawan Hans bear testimony to this.  On the other side, Niti Ayog has joined the bandwagon of wholesale privatisation of the Indian economy at the cost of the public interest and has come up with the bizarre idea of “global champions capable of producing for the world” (https://www.niti.gov.in/battling-barrier-scale), a euphemism for choking competition and consciously promoting a few private oligarchs to rule the economy. In line with this, the government has introduced yet another questionable idea, the “Production-Linked Incentive ” scheme, which provides cover for giving outright subsidies to private companies through a first-come-first-served approach, a non-transparent way of choosing beneficiaries, held illegal by the apex court in the 2G Spectrum and Coalgate cases, without imposing any obligation on beneficiary companies to add net domestic value, without any commitment that they should supply products at globally competitive prices, that they should generate pre-committed employment opportunities and contribute to indigenous open-access R&D and technology development. These subsidies, spanning over the next 5 years, amount to a mind-boggling figure of Rs 2 lakhs crores. Compare this with a paltry amount of Rs 18,000 Crores for which the government sold its flagship airline, AIr India to a private company and Rs 210 Crores at which it sold the CEL, along with its assets the value of which far exceeds the disinvestment proceeds.  In times of disasters and emergencies, when private oligarchs fleece their customers and profiteer at the cost of the economy, it is the CPSEs that rise to the occasion and provide critically needed relief. During the hard times of Covid, it was the Railways, the public sector Air India and the State-owned public transport utilities that came to the government’s aid, whereas when Indian students caught in the Ukraine war were to be brought back urgently to India, the same Air India run in the private sector charged the government heavily.  At the site of the recent railway accident in Odisha, where the surviving passengers and their families urgently needed mobile connectivity, it was not private companies that came to their help. It was the telecom CPSE, BSNL, which suffered heavily at the hands of the government all these years, that set up an emergency mobile tower , offered free connectivity to traumatised passengers and their families and demonstrated the professional competence and social sensitivity of the public sector, as illustrated by the following picture.  While BSNL offered services free of cost, the two private telecom companies, which benefited immensely from the government’s extraordinary munificence of the recent 5G auctions with little competition, charged commercial rates. They used the BSNL tower, as usual!  The policy of the government seems to be to diminish the public sector at the cost of fulfilling its own welfare mandate spelt out in the Directive Principles of the Constitution, subsidise private oligarchs at the cost of the public exchequer and promote crony capitalism of the worst kind.  A blurred vision and a policy void; are they forcing India to lose its way?

"accident","2023-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-06-08T14:56:53","What to do after a hit-and-run in New Jersey  Bumping another vehicle or property such as a mailbox or a sign can happen. But if a driver flees the scene without providing their information or making sure no one was hurt, it likely qualifies as a hit-and-run in New Jersey.  New Jersey hit-and-run laws dictate that leaving the scene of an accident could mean fines, license suspension or, in more serious cases, jail time. Knowing the proper steps to take after an accident could minimize the consequences.  Hit-and-runs in New Jersey  Recent data show that so far in 2023, New Jersey has recorded 210 crashes and 219 fatalities. And hit-and-run accidents have been trending upward nationwide, according to AAA. Some experts point to distracted motorists as a driving force behind the increase.  Regardless of whether you are behind the wheel, on a bicycle or on foot, staying alert and being aware of hit-and-run laws in the state could help prevent a severe outcome.  New Jersey hit-and-run laws  New Jersey Revised Statute Sections 39:4-129 state that drivers who strike a person or property must immediately stop. Those who don’t remain at the scene of the accident could be charged with a hit-and-run. The repercussions that follow will depend on the severity of the accident.  A New Jersey hit-and-run conviction could lead to a minimum fine ranging between $200 to $400 for a first offense, plus a potential driver’s license suspension. If someone was injured or killed, the driver might be charged with a third-degree felony and face imprisonment on top of a $2,500 to $5,000 fine. All of this applies even if the driver claims they were not aware of any serious injury caused at the time of the incident.  In addition to legal issues, a hit-and-run driver will likely have to pay higher auto insurance premiums once they’re permitted to drive again.  How hit-and-runs impact car insurance rates in New Jersey  In New Jersey, the average cost of a full coverage auto insurance policy is $1,754. Causing an accident of any sort could amount to an average spike of $829 a year, but a hit-and-run is likely to impact rates even more. That’s because the driver will have both an accident and a criminal conviction on their record and could be classified as high-risk in the eyes of insurers.  5 things to do after a hit-and-run in New Jersey  Even the safest drivers may cause an accident. However, how you handle the situation could make all the difference between a standard accident and the more serious crime of leaving the scene. To avoid being charged with a hit-and-run, consider taking the following precautions:  Stop immediately: New Jersey drivers who are involved in a collision are required by law to immediately stop. Leaving the scene may be classified as a hit-and-run. Assess the situation and the parties involved: After stopping, drivers should find out if everyone is okay. If it is unclear whether someone may be hurt, it could be a good idea to stick around for emergency services. Call for emergency services: If anyone appears disoriented or hurt, drivers should call 911 right away and request help at the scene of the accident. Document what happened: If there are no injuries or help is on the way, drivers should safely move to the side of the road to assess the damage, take photos and exchange information. Drivers who have damaged the property of someone who is not present should leave their contact information with a brief explanation of what happened. Call your insurance carrier: After any accident, drivers should call their New Jersey insurance company right away. Doing so before leaving the scene may make it easier to provide detailed information while it is still top of mind. Send photos, as well, to show the extent of the damage.  Will insurance cover a hit-and-run?  Depending on the coverage on a driver’s policy, insurance may help to pay for damages resulting from a hit-and-run:  Liability coverage: Liability insurance is required by law. Property damage liability is designed to help pay for damage to other drivers’ vehicles and/or property after an at-fault accident, while bodily injury liability is meant to help pay for the other party’s injuries.  Personal injury protection: As a no-fault state, New Jersey requires drivers to have personal injury protection (PIP). PIP is designed to help pay for your injuries and any injuries that your passengers sustain, regardless of who is at fault for an accident.  Collision coverage: Collision insurance is an optional coverage type that’s meant to help pay for damage your vehicle sustains after an accident you cause, whether incurred from colliding with another vehicle or a stationary object.  Uninsured motorist coverage: Uninsured motorist insurance is another optional coverage type that can help pay for expenses if you are involved in an accident and the at-fault driver doesn’t have insurance to cover your or your passengers’ damages.

The crash occurred along southbound Howe Avenue at the Hurley Way intersection around 4:26 p.m. When California Highway Patrol (CHP) officers arrived at the scene, they discovered a Nissan Sentra on the sidewalk and what they thought might have been the suspect vehicle at the intersection.  Authorities Seek Driver Who Fled from Two-Vehicle Accident Scene  One of the vehicles had crashed into a retaining wall. Although injuries were reportedly involved, the person who called in the collision did not want an ambulance, and two people were sitting outside the vehicle but near it. The CHP traffic investigation unit is examining the accident to determine how it occurred and is seeking the hit-and-run driver.  Identifying Hit-and-Run Drivers: How Lawyers Do It  It is common for injured parties to feel helpless and distraught following an intersection hit-and-run. You may be able to get help from an injury lawyer. By conducting diligent investigations and utilizing their legal expertise, they may be able to locate the responsible party. When the driver is located, they can negotiate for the injured party with the at-fault motorist’s insurance company or even take the case to court if necessary. The following are some ways in which a lawyer can identify a hit-and-run driver:  Area camera footage: The lawyer reviews surveillance footage from CCTV cameras or other sources to identify the missing vehicle and possibly get footage of the fleeing driver.  Witnesses to the collision: An intersection hit-and-run driver’s identity can sometimes be determined by interviewing witnesses or hearing rumors from those in the neighborhood. Lawyers are trained in interviewing techniques that allow them to obtain accurate details from those who were involved in the two-vehicle accident and witnesses.  Accident reconstruction : By reconstructing the two-vehicle accident, the lawyer can determine the positioning of the vehicles and often which driver was at fault.  Insurance: Lawyers may be able to trace the responsible party by reviewing insurance records and contacting companies that cover drivers in the area.  Social media activity: Sometimes, people brag about getting away with a hit-and-run or post about their involvement in an accident on social media. This activity can be investigated by a lawyer and used against drivers who committed such crimes.  Covering Accident Injuries With Uninsured/Underinsured Insurance  If you’re involved in an accident with a hit-and-run driver who cannot be located, you need uninsured/underinsured insurance. If the other driver is located and has insufficient coverage for your medical bills and other expenses, underinsured motorist coverage can help fill the gap between what they pay and what you need. The policy of a family member who has this coverage can be used instead if you don’t have it. Insurance rates remain the same.

We will not allow such a situation to repeat itself. I see no reason why disciplinary action will not be taken against the erring staff in this hospital”, the governor declared.  “If any medical doctor or any personnel in any of our facilities is not willing to attend to patients without cogent reason, he or she should equally be fired without hesitation”, Zulum said.  He added, “Within the next 24 hours, the Hospital Management Board and the Ministry of Health should investigate the incident and ensure disciplinary measures are enforced against all those on duty that refused to admit victims of the accident brought here.”  Governor Zulum noted that the state government has invested heavily in the health sector, including the welfare of the medical officers, across the state, and he called on medical officers to reciprocate the gesture by providing quality healthcare services to all patients without discrimination.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhbmd1YXJkbmdyLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA2L3Byb2JlLXN0YWZmLXdoby1yZWplY3RlZC12aWN0aW1zLW9mLWFjY2lkZW50LXp1bHVtLXRlbGxzLW1pbmlzdHJ5LW9mLWhlYWx0aC_SAXRodHRwczovL3d3dy52YW5ndWFyZG5nci5jb20vMjAyMy8wNi9wcm9iZS1zdGFmZi13aG8tcmVqZWN0ZWQtdmljdGltcy1vZi1hY2NpZGVudC16dWx1bS10ZWxscy1taW5pc3RyeS1vZi1oZWFsdGgvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

CBC Sports has learned that Ruck will compete in the 50, 100, and 200-metre freestyle events, as well as the 100 butterfly at an international swim meet in Santa Clara, Cali., this weekend.  Swimming Canada high performance director John Atkinson says he talked to Ruck last week and says her recovery has gone well. He's also optimistic about Ruck competing for Canada at the world championships next month in Japan.  ""She's been doing a lot of kick training. She's worked on this with her coach in Stanford and when I talked to her last week Taylor was in a very, very good place from a mental health perspective,"" Atkinson said.  ""She can go and race and get a real indicator of where she's at and I'll talk to her after the meet.""  Ruck has played a pivotal role in Canada's relay success on the international stage at the past two Olympics and world championships.  Her last competition came in mid-March when she defended her 200-yard title at the NCAA championships.  The 23-year-old from Kelowna, B.C., arrived in Toronto a week later with the intention of competing at the national trials at the Pan Am Sports Centre.  But just a couple of days ahead of trials it was revealed Ruck would not be competing.  ""I need to put myself in the best position to perform to my goals at the Olympics next year,"" Ruck said in a statement released by Swimming Canada.  ""Right now that means I need to unplug for a little while, so I can come back refreshed and ready to be at my best in the pool.""  In that same release Swimming Canada wrote that Ruck ""found she was feeling exhausted after a busy season.""

Example video title will go here for this video  EAST POINT, Ga. — East Point Police said they have more information about the case where a 9-year-old was shot and killed inside of a home while he was playing with friends. Police Chief Shawn Buchanan said the tragedy that killed King Black was likely an accident.  King was shot at a home on East Washington Avenue Saturday night. When officers arrived, they found his body outside. After interviewing witnesses, police learned King was shot inside of the home before collapsing outside. He was taken to the hospital where he later died.  ""I want to make this clear, this was not a violent attack, this was not a random attack. We truly believe this was an accidental shooting that occurred,"" Buchanan said. ""I want to make people clear on that. This was not a child out playing and was just randomly shot by a stranger.""  The 9-year-old's mother, Joy King, is heartbroken behind the shooting.  “All I heard and can remember from that day is the banging on the door and hearing King’s been shot. I just ran over,” Joy previously said.  She found her son covered in blood, fighting for his life just one street behind her house.  “He was collapsed laying down on his stomach just bleeding really bad, and I just laid next to him. I told him, 'Be strong and I love him,'” she said.  Joy said King was a rising fourth grader at Hamilton E. Holmes Elementary School who loved music.  As for the police investigation, the chief said it's still underway.  ""We're doing a very deep dive into the investigation to ensure it was an accident and making sure things were not done that shouldn't have been done or weapons left in a place they shouldn't have been left,"" Buchanan said.  The chief said they are in the final interview phase and that should wrap up Friday; any arrests would come after that.  In the meantime, King's family set up an online fundraiser for funeral expenses. Those who would like to help can do so here.","https://news.google.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?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The suspect Sanjay Kumar. (HT Photo)  Read here: ‘Seeing blood every time…’: NDRF personnel traumatised after Odisha train crash  The officials identified the man as Sanjay Kumar, a resident of Patna, adding that his mother had actually died in 2018. They said that after the Balasore accident, he travelled to Delhi with an aim to meet railways minister Ashwini Vaishnaw and seek a job for himself.  Officials told HT that Kumar, who was caught on Thursday, had not only been to the minister’s residence with his claim but also had visited the Rail Bhawan on two separate days. “When Kumar reached Vaishnaw’s residence, he was directed to Rail Bhawan in order to meet the minister. It was then that he approached the minister’s office and was apprehended after he kept changing his statements,” a railways official told HT.  Giving details of the case, one Railway Board official said, “Kumar approached officials, claiming that his mother was a passenger on the ill-fated Coromandel Express that crashed into a goods train and died in the accident. However, we got suspicious when we found that he did not have any proof of his mother’s travel.”  A second Railway Board official told HT that when Kumar was asked to show information related to his mother’s travel, he could not answer. “He claimed that he booked the ticket via a travel agent but did not remember his name. He could also not prove that his mother was on the waiting list.”  The second official said that Kumar did provide his mother’s photograph. “We started searching for his mother at all the stations at which the train had halted before the accident. Our aim was to locate her with facial recognition technology. However, when we could not locate her at any of the stations, we grew more suspicious.”  It was then, a senior official handling the case, said that Kumar confessed that he was lying about his mother’s death. “His mother had died in 2018, but after the Balasore accident when the railway ministry announced ex-gratia payment to the family of passengers who had lost their lives, Kumar decided to approach the minister and ask him to give a job rather than the compensation amount,” the official said, declining to be named.  Read here: Odisha train accident: Shrieks, screams ensued as Coromandel Express crashed.

Reyna Law Firm's services are offered to victims of such crashes in Austin and nearby along with the families of those killed in fatal collisions.  For more information see https://www.reynainjurylaw.com/austin  The Texas-wide firm states its clients can seek recompense for the effects that semi-truck accidents have had on their lives. Reyna Law Firm presents its new consultation and representation options with services specifically suited for the immediate aftermath of truck crashes, drawing on its team's relevant legal experience in this area.  Heavy commercial fleet vehicles have the capacity to cause immense destruction in the event of a traffic disaster. This is precisely why trucking companies typically need to hold premium insurance coverage for their vehicles. For the individual who's been injured in a trucking accident, however, dealing with insurers can prove tricky.  As explained by Reyna Law Firm: ""The trucking company or their insurance company may reach out to you directly to offer you a settlement offer early on in the case. However, it is rarely recommended that you take this without first consulting with a Texas trucking accident lawyer.""  The assistance of a personal injury professional can prove crucial for truck accident victims, says the firm. Owing to its ability to collaborate with medical personnel and assess related documents, Reyna Law Firm is able to determine the extent of its clients' injuries and evaluate the appropriateness of any settlements that have been proposed.  In the event that clients are perceived as being shortchanged by insurers or opposing legal teams, Reyna Law Firm offers legal help. Acknowledging that truck accident victims are rarely in a condition to focus on injury claims, the firm does all legwork involved with negotiations and, when called upon, representing clients in court.  Reyna Law Firm remains equipped to advise clients in their recovery from all manner of vehicular accidents, citing its work with victims of crashes involving cars and motorcycles as well as 18-wheelers.  ""I was in a severe car wreck and suffered a concussion,"" said one prior client. ""I thought I was going to lose everything.

"accident","2019-01-06","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-06-08T18:48:11","Like so many – from collaborators to fans – Chris Hemsworth was shaken by the news of Jeremy Renner being hospitalized in early January after a snowplow accident left him with 30+ broken bones. Through both the accident and his MCU co-stars, Hemsworth began to acknowledge just how quickly life can be taken, as the Avengers united via a group text in the immediate aftermath.  In a new profile for GQ, Chris Hemsworth said that Jeremy Renner’s accident – in which he was run over by a 14,000+-pound snowcat while helping a family member free their car after a storm – offered an opportunity to put life into perspective, all while he and his Marvel family had no idea if Renner would pull through. “We were all on our Avengers text chain, we were all chatting. And it was wild. None of us really knew how serious it was…I think anything like that, it’s an immediate realisation of ‘Wow, any of us can go at any minute……We’re getting to the age now where we’re going to start losing people we love.” The 39-year-old actor added, “I don’t think I wanna turn 40…I still feel like I’m 25 and I’ve got heaps of time. Now I’m like, ‘Oh, I could be halfway. More than halfway.’…The reality of ‘I’m not going to be here forever’ is sinking in.”  While Jeremy Renner’s accident highlighted the true fragility of life, his recovery process – which he has been detailing over the last six months – has been a true inspiration. Renner has provided numerous updates for his fans on social media, proving that the old cliche of a “real-life superhero” is sometimes deserved.  While Chris Hemsworth didn’t specifically say who was on the group text, Scarlett Johansson previously told Variety that she and Chris Evans visited Jeremy Renner in the hospital, which probably points to a couple of big names. “I was honestly so fucking happy to see him. I didn’t know if I was ever going to see him again…To not only see him again but to see him thriving and in such an amazing space, mentally…And I just was so happy to see that he is full of life and light, and he’s also hilarious.”  While Chris Hemsworth and Jeremy Renner haven’t shared the screen for some time now, the former has made time to reflect on his day of Thor and the negative feedback the MCU movies have gotten from major directors.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmpvYmxvLmNvbS9jaHJpcy1oZW1zd29ydGgtcmVtZW1iZXJzLXdpbGQtYXZlbmdlcnMtZ3JvdXAtdGV4dC1hZnRlci1qZXJlbXktcmVubmVycy1hY2NpZGVudC_SAfsBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuam9ibG8uY29tL2NocmlzLWhlbXN3b3J0aC1yZW1lbWJlcnMtd2lsZC1hdmVuZ2Vycy1ncm91cC10ZXh0LWFmdGVyLWplcmVteS1yZW5uZXJzLWFjY2lkZW50L2FtcC8_ZmJjbGlkPUl3QVIwY2lydDM5R2RqVjlhemVxZGNhRG9GT0lQZURSV29EWEZhQ2RTNnMydENnRjhWM0hSc0ZPX1ZGSkVfYWVtX3RoX0FiLVBQMGMzZjllZXgtSVd4ZC12SGpPcERVa1dsZXRMZEo2ZWNTR3p2YkR3bE1mSWpJVURYTWtYcGRjdDBjdFNHdjA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The vehicle was driving in autonomous mode when the accident occurred.  Waymo, which is owned by Google’s parent company Alphabet, said that although the vehicle saw the dog running towards it, it was “not able to avoid contact.” It cites the “unusual path” of the animal and the speed at which it ran towards the vehicle, as reasons why.  “The investigation is ongoing, however the initial review confirmed that the system correctly identified the dog which ran out from behind a parked vehicle but was not able to avoid contact,” Waymo said in a statement to Tech Crunch. “We send our sincere condolences to the dog’s owner.”  Read: Software Bug Causes Waymo Traffic Than Usual In Bizarre Driverless Jam  Waymo says that its autonomous system saw the dog despite the human operator missing it, likely because of the angle at which the dog approached it. However, neither the human operator nor the vehicle’s autonomous systems applied the brakes.  As part of its investigation, Waymo reconstructed the accident in simulations to see if a non-impaired driver with their eyes always on the dog could have stopped in time, and found that they could not. It says that means that the collision was unavoidable in this circumstance.  advertisement scroll to continue  Regardless, Waymo could still suffer backlash for this incident. The company recently expanded its area of operation in Phoenix, Arizona, and teamed up with Uber to give the public autonomous taxi rides.  It is also gearing up to do the same in San Francisco. A blow to its public image could put riders’ willingness to get in its autonomous vehicles at risk, which is something that Waymo recognizes.  “The trust and safety of the communities we are in is the most important thing to us, and we’re continuing to look into this on our end,” it said in a statement.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcnNjb29wcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wNi93YXltby1zZWxmLWRyaXZpbmctY2FyLWtpbGxzLWRvZy1pbi11bmF2b2lkYWJsZS1hY2NpZGVudC1hY2NvcmRpbmctdG8tdGhlLWNvbXBhbnkv0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2Fyc2Nvb3BzLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA2L3dheW1vLXNlbGYtZHJpdmluZy1jYXIta2lsbHMtZG9nLWluLXVuYXZvaWRhYmxlLWFjY2lkZW50LWFjY29yZGluZy10by10aGUtY29tcGFueS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"accident","2023-08-16","18:00:00","{""Baleshwar"", ""Orissa"", ""India""}","2023-06-09T06:05:53","The ghastly triple-train accident in Odisha has exposed the loopholes in the Railways including under-funded passenger safety programme, overburdened tracks, and the inadequate maintenance of existing railway lines which need an upgrade  The deadly train accident involving the Shalimar-Chennai Coromandel Express and Yesvantpur-Howrah Express in Odisha’s Balasore has left at least 288 dead and thousands more injured. As the debris at the accident site gets cleared and loved ones mourn the dead, it is about time that Railways’ safety practices come under the lens.  It is already known that there has been under-funding of the key safety programme, Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh (RRSK), ever since it was launched. This has happened because the Railways has consistently failed to put in its share in the fund, which was to come from internal accruals. And such under-funding of RRSK has happened also when the year-on-year increase in budgetary allocation for the Railways has been on record high, with 2023-24 allocation the highest-ever at ₹2.4 lakh crore.  Also read: Odisha train tragedy: By roping in CBI, Centre seeks to absolve itself of neglect  While the case has been handed over to the CBI to investigate the reason behind the deadly crash, it is pertinent to examine how misplaced focus on launching new trains and upgrading passenger amenities, while perhaps not focusing enough on safety practices, may have led to the sad state of affairs.  Vande Bharat mania  Since Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke of launching 75 Vande Bharat trains in his Independence Day speech of 2021, the PR around the launch of these trains has overshadowed all other aspects of the functioning of the Indian Railways.  As per budget estimates for 2023-24, the Railways has earmarked a fifth of the total annual allocation for rolling stock at ₹51,510 crore, which is more than the combined allocation for new lines and gauge conversion. The allocation for doubling existing lines has seen a 28 per cent decline versus RE of 2022-23. And though the budget allocation for track renewals is up 12 per cent, the biggest jump has been earmarked for passenger amenities at 180 per cent. This money is meant mainly for developing railway stations.  A senior, retired Railway official said that while the emphasis on launching Vande Bharat trains is a welcome move, it remains counterproductive since the new trains are unable to reach their speed potential due to the poor condition of the tracks.  Also read: Sabotage behind Odisha train tragedy? Sr. Rly engineer’s tell-all interview  “The time saved by deploying Vande Bharat trains on many routes is just 10-15 minutes, and this saving also comes from better acceleration and deceleration of these trains, not due to faster speed. The Railways has been unable to speed up trains despite assertions to the contrary,” the official said.  Vande Bharat can run at 160 kmph but the average speed on Indian tracks is just 50 kmph; the train comes fitted with the Kavach anti-collision system which has been ready for long, but the Railways has been unable to deploy it on a majority of the network.  Since the Vande Bharat trains are equipped to be faster and safer, they also command a premium in fares. This renders them unaffordable for large masses of rail passengers who continue to depend on older train sets. Several railway experts have said that instead of focusing single-mindedly on Vande Bharat train manufacturing, the Railways needs to take measures to increase the overall speed of passenger trains on its network through infrastructure upgrades.  Congestion compromises safety  One of the most obvious and perhaps the most ignored reasons for lax safety practices across the railways network is massive congestion. Alok Kumar Verma, retired chief engineer with the Railways, quoted the National Rail Plan devised by the national transporter itself to point out that about 10,000 km of the trunk routes across the railway network are so congested that they are using 125 per cent of capacity.  “Amid such congestion, if there is systemic failure somewhere along the network, a lot of trains get bunched up (Balasore is one of the busy lines, trains after seven to eight minutes in both directions). When trains start bunching up, the effect could be felt for several 100 kms on the network, and the after-effects last for two-three days before operations normalise. During this time, there can be no inspection and no maintenance work, even if it is a scheduled maintenance block,” Verma said. So congestion and delayed trains are directly impacting safety practices across the railways network.  Also read: Odisha train accident: School that stored bodies may be razed as kids refuse to return  Besides, due to such severe congestion and trains bunching up, manpower gets overworked and stressed. Station masters, loco pilots, and other safety workers are compelled to work overtime due to delays. This further compromises the safety of the network.  The Ministry of Railways had projected an additional 275 million passengers, on an average, each year between 2021 and 2031. By 2031, the Railways is projected to transport over 12 billion people annually. But with new lines, equipment, and manpower not keeping pace, how will safety practices get the required upgrade?  Verma said the need of the hour is for the Railways to build new lines, parallel to the existing ones. “The Railways needs to upgrade about 15,000 km of trunk routes to remove bottlenecks and raise train speeds. On another 10,000 km, new trunk lines must be built – they need not be adjacent to existing lines but can be built close by so that major stations en route remain the same. Today, some of the busiest routes on the Railway network are Delhi-Mumbai, Delhi-Howrah, Delhi-Chennai, Mumbai-Howrah, and Howrah-Chennai (through Balasore). These routes are heavily congested,” he said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlZmVkZXJhbC5jb20vYW5hbHlzaXMvbGVzc29ucy1sZWFybnQtZnJvbS1vZGlzaGEtdHJhaW4tYWNjaWRlbnQtdXBncmFkZWQtdHJhY2tzLWRlY29uZ2VzdGlvbi1vZi1yYWlsd2F5LWxpbmVzLW11c3Qv0gGBAWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlZmVkZXJhbC5jb20vYW5hbHlzaXMvbGVzc29ucy1sZWFybnQtZnJvbS1vZGlzaGEtdHJhaW4tYWNjaWRlbnQtdXBncmFkZWQtdHJhY2tzLWRlY29uZ2VzdGlvbi1vZi1yYWlsd2F5LWxpbmVzLW11c3QvP2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

On Tuesday, June 6, Grayson Pope, a rising junior and “standout” baseball player at Hewitt-Trussville High School, was playing golf with teammates when a storm started brewing in Trussville, the Trussville Tribune reported.  “I just remember hearing the crack of a tree,” Brett Moseley, a teammate who was in the golf cart with Pope, told AL.com. “He was driving and I was in the passenger seat.”  The tree came crashing down, hitting the golf cart and knocking Pope unconscious in a “freak accident,” his father, David Pope, said in a Facebook post.  “He was just laying there,” Moseley told AL.com. “When I grabbed him out of the cart, I was carrying him and I sat him down. Nobody’s phone would work because it was so wet, so I used Siri to call 911.”  Pope’s family said he was rushed to a hospital and began testing for a traumatic brain injury. By the evening of June 7, he had undergone multiple CT scans and had significant brain swelling, according to a Facebook post made in a “Prayers for Grayson Pope” community page.  Grayson Pope, a rising junior, was a “standout” baseball player already committed to a college program, outlets report.  “He is on a ventilator but trying and breathing on his own at times,” the 8:34 p.m. update read. “He is sedated and when they reduce that he is starting to respond to pain but not as much as they want him to. He isn’t responding to verbal commands. Because he isn’t responding verbally, they are doing an MRI to make sure there isn’t some bleeding somewhere else that the CT scan didn’t show.”  As Pope was fighting in the hospital, his community came together.  Around 10 p.m. on June 6, around 150 people gathered at a local church to pray for Pope, many of whom were high school classmates who cheered for him on the field, the Trussville Tribune reported.  Pope committed to play baseball at the University of Tennessee as a sophomore, according to the Trussville Tribune, and he also plays for a club team.  Grayson, right, was hit by a falling tree during a storm on a golf course, his family said.  “We ask for prayers from everyone for our guy, Grayson Pope and his family,” Excel Baseball Academy wrote on Facebook. “It is going to be a real fight and a long recovery, but we know G is going to battle back.”  On June 7, a huge crowd gathered at a public park to pray and sing for Pope, led by musician Ethan Womack, AL.com reported.  Photos of Pope sat on tables with baseballs inscribed with “Pray 4 Gray,” group members shared on the community Facebook page.  “David and I are overwhelmed by the love and prayers from Trussville, Knoxville, Chattanooga, Kentucky and many other states,” Pope’s mother, Jamie Partin Pope, wrote on the page. “Grayson feels your prayers!”  In a June 8 update, David Pope said his son’s neurologist told them he had micro hemorrhages on his brain and on his brain stem. He said the bleeds explained why Pope wasn’t responding to verbal commands and movements.  “The plan is to continue to heal and take another MRI in 1 week to see where he is at,” David Pope said in a Facebook post.

The school was hastily turned into a temporary morgue, following the deadly train accident that claimed the lives of 288 people and injured over 1,000.  The school management committee has now requested the government to demolish the 65-year-old school building of the Bahanaga High School, located near the Bahanaga Bazar railway station.  According to a report in Aaj Tak, parents of the students are getting nervous to send their children back to the building. However, the committee has said that the reason for their request to demolish the school is the age of the building.  Pramila Swain, headmistress of the Bahanaga High School, has said that the young children are scared to come back to the school. The school has planned to organise ‘spiritual programmes’ and conduct rituals in order to remove the fear from the minds of these children. Swain added that some of the senior students and NCC cadets of the school had also participated in the rescue operation.  Also read: Balasore train accident: 82 bodies still unidentified; Odisha consults neighbours  The School and Mass Education Department had directed Balasore collector Dattatraya Bhausaheb to visit the school. He said that after meeting the headmistress and the staff, he has learned that everyone wants to demolish the old building and construct a new one.  The collector was told by a member of the school committee that the children saw on TV that the dead bodies were kept in the school building, after which the children got nervous to return to school on June 16.  The school premises were sanitised after the bodies were taken to Bhubaneswar. However, the parents and children are in a state of panic.  The school committee had earlier given permission to keep the dead bodies in only three classes but the district administration had to keep the bodies in the open hall for identification.  District Education Officer (DEO) Bishnu Charan Sutar organised a meeting to motivate the students and parents. He also said that no student will be out of school. “We will ensure that no student is out of school. The school and the local people have contributed a lot in the rescue and relief operation. The District Collector said that he has asked the school committee to pass a resolution demanding the demolition of the building and hand it over to the government. He also said that the school building is old and is often used to shelter people during floods. The school can be renovated under the transformation program,” said Sutar.

Adair County Sheriff Jeff Vandewater says that if you do have an accident, the first thing you should do is figure out if you need emergency help or not. He explains that if you do, then call 911. If you don’t need emergency help, then there are a few things that could happen. If it was a single vehicle accident, a claim would need to be made to the drivers insurance company, along with moving the vehicle so that other motorists will be safe.  Vandewater adds that if it is a multiple vehicle accident, always get the other person’s insurance information, and give them your information as well, that way when both individuals contact their own insurance, they can give correct information. When it comes to trying to prevent accidents, he tells Raccoon Valley Radio what he thinks is most important to do.  “Well, I think the biggest thing, as busy as we all are, I think the biggest thing is to just slow down and focus on driving. Slowing down, lowering your speed, staying at the speed limit. That gives you a lot more reaction time.”  Vandewater mentions that another thing that drivers can do to help prevent accidents is to reduce the number of distractions. That means leaving your phone alone when you’re behind the wheel and trying not to look away to long if you need to adjust your radio. He advises that people also practice defensive driving habits, because even if you’re being safe and doing what you’re supposed to, that doesn’t always mean that other drivers are being safe.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhY2Nvb252YWxsZXlyYWRpby5jb20vMjAyMy8wNi8wOC9hZGFpci1jb3VudHktc2hlcmlmZi1vbi1yb2FkLWFuZC1hY2NpZGVudC1zYWZldHkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Instead, she wears them like a badge of honour.  The Big Bang Theory actor, 37, opened up about her scars, as well as the accident where she acquired them, during an appearance on the SmartLess podcast, cohosted by Jason Bateman, Will Arnett, and Sean Hayes.  Kaley is an experienced horse jumper and competitor, so her visit to a Los Angeles ranch in September 2010 should have been smooth sailing. Unfortunately, it was anything but. Shortly after she saddled up and readied to ride, her horse got spooked and threw Kaley off. She landed on the ground, directly under the horse, which attempted to jump over her but instead crushed her left leg. The average horse weighs up to 1,200 pounds, so you can imagine the damage.  “I remember clear as day, because it takes a second when something is that bad. I was like, ‘Did I just fall on a whole thing of leaves?’ Because I heard all the cracking,” she explained to everyone's horror. “It took me like 5 or 10 seconds to actually realise it wasn’t just 400 leaves; it was my bones.” Kaley sustained a compound fracture of her tibia and fibula, which resulted in a “horrible, horrible, horrible break” that forced her bones through her skin.  Due to the severity of the injury, doctors made Kaley sign a release form that allowed them to amputate her leg if necessary. “They made me sign something that said, 'We don't know until we get in there and see this leg, and it could come out that you don't have it anymore,’” she shared in The Big Bang Theory: The Definitive, Inside Story of the Epic Hit Series. Thankfully, Kaley was back on her feet after two weeks, despite doctors not expecting her to be able to walk again.  Today Kaley is left with significant scarring that she wears like a badge of bravery. “I've got some good scars,” she said. “It makes you feel like a badass.” The severity of the accident didn't keep her away from horses for long. In an April Instagram story, Kaley shared sweet pics of her two-month-old daughter, Matilda, meeting Kaley's horses, Carlata and Cody.  Nothing can keep Kaley Cuoco away from her horses, not even almost losing a leg.

"accident","1999-10-25","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-06-08T13:15:00","In 1999, a plane followed a strange route in the United States skies. It took off from Florida and climbed to the intended altitude, but instead of flying towards Dallas, where it was supposed to go, it started flying straight over the US towards Canada.  The crew couldn't be contacted and military aircraft were scrambled to accompany and even intercept the Phantom Flight, fearing the worst.  However, what nobody knew at that time was that everyone on board the plane was either unconscious or deceased.  The aircraft, a Learjet 35 registered as flight number N47BA, was a private jet carrying several important individuals. They departed from Orlando, Florida on October 25, 1999. Among the passengers were golf legend Payne Stewart, former football star Robert Fraley, the president of Stewart Golf Agency, Van Arden and Bruce Borland, a golf course architect from Jack Nicklaus' company.  The plane also had two pilots, Michael Kling and Stephanie Belgrigg, for whom it was a routine trip to Dallas, Texas. In total, six people were on board the small aircraft, which was set for a leisurely three-hour flight.  Learjet 35 grounded on the tarmac (credit: Wikimedia Commons)  They took off as usual and began climbing to the pre-approved altitude of 11,900 meters (39,000 feet) above sea level. At 7,000 meters (23,000 feet), radio contact was confirmed by the pilot, indicating that everything was in order. That was the last communication received from the plane.  Six minutes later, an attempt was made to get in contact with the plane, but there was no response. Multiple subsequent attempts to get in contact, but failed. Red warning lights flashed, alarm bells rang and it was time for the Air Force to intervene.  An F-16 fighter jet in the area flew to intercept the Learjet and perform a visual inspection.  Colonel Olson, the pilot of the fighter jet, had said that there was no visible damage to the Learjet and it was flying straight, but he couldn't see what was happening in the cockpit and identify the crew. The windows were sealed, appearing to be covered in a layer of water or ice.  Two additional jets were dispatched later for further investigation, confirming the growing concern. According to some Pentagon reports, there was consideration of shooting it down in case the plane entered populated airspace. However, these reports were denied, claiming that it was never a viable option.  Nevertheless, former Canadian prime minister, Jean Chretien, admitted later in a book he wrote that if the Learjet 35 had entered Canadian airspace, there would have been authorization to shoot it down due to the fear of it crashing into the city of Winnipeg.  As the aircraft only carried fuel for four and a half hours of flight, when it ran out, it began a spiraling descent. Eyewitness accounts noted that it appeared to have lost control and was heading toward the ground at almost supersonic speed.  Learjet 35 grounded (credit: Wikimedia Commons)  It crashed on flat ground in South Dakota, completely destroying the aircraft and leaving a large crater.  So, what happened to the crew?  After the investigation, it was determined that there had been a drastic loss of cabin pressure throughout the aircraft. It is unclear why this happened, but the crew was unable to obtain any oxygen and lost consciousness due to hypoxia.  The others on the plane quickly realized they were deprived of air and lost consciousness due to the drop in oxygen levels, which is what happened to the pilots.  The autopilot then maintained the aircraft's altitude and flew straight until the fuel ran out. For nearly four hours, the plane flew without anyone controlling it.  To this day, it remains unclear why the sudden loss of cabin pressure happened. Findings from the black box recordings indicated that no one was responsive during the final minutes of the flight and it is possible that the entire crew lost consciousness right after their last known contact with air traffic control.  Findings from the wreckage indicated that the pressure valve of the oxygen bottle that was supposed to be activated in the event of a dip in air pressure was open and the simulation team determined that, assuming the oxygen bottle contained an adequate supply of oxygen, additional oxygen should have been available to the oxygen masks for the two pilots. It is still unknown why that didn't happen.  The safety board was unable to determine why the crew couldn't or didn't receive supplemental oxygen in sufficient time and/or at an adequate concentration to prevent hypoxia and loss of functional capacity.  A report by the National Transportation Safety Board showed that the plane underwent several maintenances related to cabin pressure in the months leading up to the crash. Investigators were unable to determine whether the jobs were due to a common problem - replacements and repairs were documented, but no reports of pilot discrepancies that caused the repairs or the frequency of such reports were found.  A memorial now stands at the site of the crash, dedicated to the victims of the tragic accident, but we will never know what really happened aboard Learjet 35.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpwb3N0LmNvbS9qLXNwb3QvYXJ0aWNsZS03NDU2NDTSAS1odHRwczovL20uanBvc3QuY29tL2otc3BvdC9hcnRpY2xlLTc0NTY0NC9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"accident","2023-06-06","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-06-08T17:13:49","Nevada Man Sentenced to 30 Days in Jail for Fatal Car Accident that Killed Paiute Filmmaker Myron Dewey  Tags  Details By Darren Thompson June 08, 2023  Schurz, NEV. —John Walsh was sentenced in Nye County, Nev., on Tuesday, June 6, to 30 days in the Nye County Jail for a car accident that left Paiute journalist Myron Dewey dead at 49.  Walsh pleaded guilty in April to vehicular manslaughter for the death of Dewey after nearly two years of court proceedings. Dewey’s family and supporters were disappointed in the sentencing, with one of his sons saying it is another example of injustice against Indigenous people.  “My father’s failed justice from Nye County is a clear example of how we as Indigenous are treated and how the white privilege is taken care of,” said Joseph Dewey, one of Myron’s sons, in a statement on Wednesday. “After almost two years of this battle for justice, we were let down even more as Judge Jennifer Klapper showed no compassion as she handed 30 days to a murderer.”  Never miss Indian Country’s biggest stories and breaking news. Sign up to get our reporting sent straight to your inbox every weekday morning.  The sentencing comes close to two years after Dewey’s death on Sept. 26, 2021. Walsh wasn’t charged by Nye County officials until July 13, 2022, after Dewey’s family pressured Nye County officials to continue to investigate the car accident.  Walsh was initially charged with driving under the influence resulting in death, and reckless driving resulting in death, after law enforcement found he had cannabinoids in his blood system. He faced 20 years in Nevada state prison.  Dewey was an award-winning filmmaker, journalist, professor and activist from the Walker River Paiute Indian Reservation in Schurz, Nev. He founded Smoke Signals, a multi-media platform to bridge Tribes and technology. One of his most notable contributions to journalism was his live-streaming from the encampments near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in 2016 and 2017. Thousands of people joined in solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe to protest the building of an underground crude oil pipeline—the Dakota Access Pipeline—and Dewey live-streamed on-the-ground events on multi-media platforms.  Dewey co-directed the award-winning 2017 film, “Awake: A Dream from Standing Rock.” The film tells a side of the story of the Indigenous-led, peaceful resistance for clean water, the environment, and the future of the planet in of the largest protest encampments in American history. Dewey’s drone footage of environmental causes earned him a visiting professor status at Duke University in 2021, where he taught rogue journalism at the Center for Documentary Studies.  Walsh was sentenced to 30 days in the Nye County Jail, five months suspended driver’s license, 250 hours of community service, and an 8-hour drug and alcohol class.  “Judge Jennifer Klapper sentenced John Walsh today to a mere 250 hours of community service and one-month county jail for vehicular manslaughter against Myron Dewey,” Deborah Parker, Myron’s former partner and mother of his youngest child, told Native News Online. “Our family is devastated with the result. Justice was not served.”  Walsh avoided a trial and likely a harsher sentence in exchange for a plea. Statistically, defendants who accept a plea arrangement are given a lighter sentence suggestion by the prosecutor, where a judge most often agrees. There are many reasons courts and defendants approach and accept plea arrangements over trial: they cost less, they take less time, and they lower the risk of a harsher punishment.  “The judge chose to acknowledge John Walsh’s attorney’s request for community service even with the fifth district attorney on our family’s side,” Joseph Dewey said. “Historically, systemic racism against Indigenous peoples through the U.S. courts has been going on over 400 years and continues.”  More Stories Like This  Native News is free to read.

The boat captain, Daniel Gavin Couch, 49, has been charged with manslaughter in the crash. The Florida public defender's office representing Couch in the criminal case declined Thursday to comment on that case, which is still pending.  Roughly a dozen family members, including Alaparthi’s 6-year-old daughter and her husband, were on the boat at the time of the crash and watched on as their loved one died. They were visiting the Keys from Elk Grove Village, Illinois, and told the captain they could return the next day if the weather was too bad to go up in the parasail. But the captain said it would be OK, the family's attorney Michael Haggard said when he filed the first wrongful death lawsuit last June.  After the parasail hit the bridge, Alaparthi was underwater. Her 10-year-old son was hanging upright, and her 9-year-old nephew was bent backward with his head under water, the report said.  “The captain did not maneuver his vessel under the bridge to offer aide even though the family members on the parasail vessel later reported they were begging him to help,” the arrest warrant said.  The captain of a nearby boat took the victims to shore.  ""Thankfully, he cut those three down, he administered CPR, along with the people on his boat, and he took them to the nearest dock and he called for emergency services,"" said Pedro Echarte with The Haggard Law Firm. ""Unfortunately, it was too late for Srinivasro's wife. But that captain and his herioc action saved the lives of those two children. He is a true hero in every sense of the word.""  Investigators also found Couch’s decision to cut the tow line was “gross and flagrant” and he should have taken into account other possible options to safely bring the passengers down.  ""There needs to be strict regulations in place, and those who disregard the safety of the guests should face these consequences for their actions,"" Srinivasro Alaparthi said.  Alaparthi's son and nephew suffered ""severe physical injuries,"" his lawyer said, which, in addition emotional injuries, they are still recovering from a year later.  ""The loss sustained on May 30, 2022 is unimaginable,"" said Echarte. ""Her son and nephew were not only injured themselves, but they were strapped onto this parasail and witnessed their mother and aunt suffer her last and final moments.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYmNjaGljYWdvLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2h1c2JhbmQtb2YtaWxsaW5vaXMtd29tYW4ta2lsbGVkLWluLXRyYWdpYy1wYXJhc2FpbGluZy1jcmFzaC1zcGVha3Mtb3V0LWZvci0xc3QtdGltZS1zaW5jZS1hY2NpZGVudC8zMTU3NjIxL9IBmAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYmNjaGljYWdvLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2h1c2JhbmQtb2YtaWxsaW5vaXMtd29tYW4ta2lsbGVkLWluLXRyYWdpYy1wYXJhc2FpbGluZy1jcmFzaC1zcGVha3Mtb3V0LWZvci0xc3QtdGltZS1zaW5jZS1hY2NpZGVudC8zMTU3NjIxLz9hbXA9MQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Cruz said it was about 2:19 p.m. when a Mass Coastal trash train came over the bridge, hitting the man and pushing him into the water below.  Witnesses, including a train conductor, reportedly jumped into the water to try to save him. The man was eventually pulled from the water and taken to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead.

(WAFB) - The St. Francisville community is coming together to honor the life of 38-year-old Rachel Hann.  She died in a boating accident last week on the Mississippi River.  RELATED: Missing boater identified; boat operator hospitalized after crash  “She’s my baby sister, she’s my little sister. So, this earth will not be as sparkly without her,” said Breanne Hales, Rachel Hann’s sister.  Hann was the passenger in a 16-foot aluminum vessel when the vessel hit a moving barge in the Mississippi River near St. Francisville on May 30. Officials said Hann was ejected into the water and did not resurface.  Her body was recovered days later, a couple of miles from where the incident took place.  RELATED: St. Francisville woman’s body found in Mississippi River  “And so, while this is terrible, that’s worse. Not knowing if she’s coming back, not knowing what’s going to happen is so much worse. And we’re just so grateful that everybody got on their boats, all the search and rescue teams, all the people who volunteered their time, citizens just got in their boats and went looking for her,” said Hales.  Hann had only been living in St. Francisville for a short time.  However, people said she had already made a huge impact on the town and those that lived there.  Thursday night was all about celebrating her life with some of her favorite things.  “Rachel’s favorite food groups would be pizza, chocolate, boxed wine, and chips. She loved all of that good stuff. She was a junk food kind of a junkie, and managed to keep her skinny figure,” said Hales.  People wore pink shirts, which was her favorite color. And her best friends said, they even got matching tattoos of a camping symbol, during one of their girls trips years ago.  “She came back here, she wanted to be here. And she loved this community, and they just opened their arms to her, and she felt so at home,” said Annie Elliott, Rachel’s best friend.  “She wasn’t here for a very long time in St. Francisville, but everybody knew her. She made so many friends. And everybody she met, they absolutely loved her,” said Devon Anderson, Rachel’s best friend.  The group also released paper lanterns right alongside the river, which was one of her favorite places to be.  Her life was lost so tragically, it makes it a little bit better to say that we know that she was really, really happy when she went, and that’s a little bit of solace if anything,” said Genevieve Schaefer, Rachel’s best friend.  “I’m just so glad that she had as much love in her life as she did,” said Hale.  The boat operator was also hospitalized after the crash.  The Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries is in charge of the investigation, which is still ongoing at this time.

The staff member was on site at the splash pad when exposed to the chemicals, but the person was able to call Burlington Rural Fire Chief Karter Lesmann before collapsing. Lesmann arrived on the scene and performed life-saving measures until an ambulance arrived.  “I don’t know 100 percent what caused it. A Fargo company had been working on it and adjusting the levels of chemicals. It looked like an injection line wasn’t where it was supposed to be. So, they walked right into a cloud of vapor,” Lesmann said. “I just got called there as a responder, but there were no meters or detectors. It’s hard to protect yourself if you’re not going to spend the money to do it.”  Lesmann said that the pad will be closed until repairs and updates have been done to ensure proper ventilation and the facility is in compliance with health and safety rules. However, Lesmann was unsure how long Burlington residents would be without a local option to cool off and beat the heat.  “That’s a good question.

"accident","2012-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Sarasota"", ""Florida"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-06-06T16:09:39","Understanding the Heightened Car Accident Risks for Seniors in Sarasota Florida  Growing number of older drivers in Sarasota, Florida face increased road risks.  Seniors practice safe driving but are vulnerable to severe accidents.  Florida witnesses high traffic fatalities among drivers aged 65 and older.  Experienced car accident injury lawyers at Goldman, Babboni, Fernandez, Murphy & Walsh are available for free consultations  The evolving landscape of Sarasota, Florida roadways sees older drivers more frequently behind the wheel. Despite seniors usually being more careful and employing safe driving practices such as avoiding speeding and driving under the influence, they are more susceptible to severe injury or fatality in a car crash. In such cases, a local Sarasota car accident lawyer could be a critical advocate for those affected.  At Goldman, Babboni, Fernandez, Murphy & Walsh, our proficient team of Sarasota car accident lawyers understands the worries about senior drivers on the road, especially in Florida. The state is known for a high number of traffic fatalities involving drivers aged 65 and older. As our Baby Boomer population continues to age, we predict an increase in crash rates.  The Statistics  Statistics from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) show about 35 million licensed drivers in the U.S. aged 65 and older, a figure set to rise to 40 million by 2020. Projections in Florida suggest that by 2030, one in four drivers will be over 65. In 2012, car accidents claimed the lives of 5,560 senior drivers nationwide and injured 214,000 more, highlighting the critical role that a Sarasota car accident attorney can play.  Florida, unfortunately, carries the burden of having the highest percentage of older drivers and, in correlation, the highest number of accidents involving seniors. TRIP, a national transportation research group, noted that within a single year, 271 senior drivers in Florida tragically died in car accidents. The fatalities involving a senior driver, of all ages, exceeded 500.  The Advantages and Concerns  Despite the rising number of accidents as drivers age, particularly those above 80, it's not necessarily due to a higher propensity for accidents. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pointed out these drivers are more susceptible to injuries and ensuing medical complications. If injured, contacting a car accident lawyer in Sarasota can be instrumental in navigating the aftermath.  Nevertheless, it's worth mentioning that seniors have some safety advantages on the road:  • They are more likely to use their seat belts, with nearly 80 percent buckling up.    • Senior drivers typically avoid driving during unfavorable weather, at night, or in heavy traffic, reducing their chances of an accident.    • Impaired driving is less prevalent among senior drivers, with only 5 percent of deadly crashes involving a senior driver reporting a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.08 or higher.  • They generally disapprove of and refrain from phone use while driving, minimizing distractions.  Despite these positives, there are some worries. Age-related deficits such as reduced vision, slower cognitive processing, and physical limitations can lead to higher crash rates among senior drivers. The increased usage of prescription medications and the potential for medical emergencies while driving also present additional risks. In these situations, a car accident attorney in Sarasota can help manage the legal aspects.  The Challenges Faced by Senior Drivers  Decreased Vision: Safe driving depends heavily on good vision, which naturally declines with age. This decline affects the ability to perceive and react to hazards, road signs, pedestrians, and other vehicles. Seniors may also struggle with nighttime vision, dealing with the glare of oncoming headlights, or transitioning quickly from light to dark and vice versa. Reduced peripheral vision and the development of eye diseases, like cataracts or macular degeneration, exacerbate these issues.  Slower Cognitive Processing:  Aging can also affect cognitive abilities, particularly processing speed and multitasking. This can increase the risk of accidents, making the services of a Sarasota car accident lawyer invaluable in these unfortunate events.

The plane Azarian and the others were traveling in was registered to Encore Motors of Melbourne, Inc., a company owned by John and Barbara Rumpel.  According to the Federal Aviation Administration, the plane departed Elizabethton Municipal Airport heading for Long Island’s MacArthur Airport in New York.  The plane reached the New York area before making a U-turn and heading toward Virginia, according to the flight-tracking website Flight Aware. It continued past the airport it was scheduled to land at and flew over restricted airspace in Washington DC.  After the plane entered the restricted airspace and the pilot did not respond to air traffic controllers, F-16s were deployed and authorized to travel at supersonic speeds to catch up with the plane. The speed at which the F-16s flew caused the sonic boom heard across the area.  After flying over DC, the plane began to descend, until it crashed in the George Washington National Forest.  “My family is gone, my daughter and granddaughter,” Barbara Rumpel, wrote in a Facebook post soon after the crash.

Last December, Freddie, was involved in an accident at the programme’s test track at Dunsfold Aerodrome while filming and was airlifted to hospital.  Production has since ceased on the series, with BBC bosses saying in March that it would be “inappropriate” to resume while Freddie continues his recovery.  Weighing in on Top Gear’s future, James, who co-hosted the series alongside Jeremy Clarkson and Richard Hammond, told City AM the “unfortunate” incident could lead to a “reinvention” of the show.  “It happens now and then, and it’s no bad thing,” he pointed out. “That’s a big, difficult question for the BBC.  “The Freddie Flintoff thing is deeply unfortunate. It’s obviously a bit more serious than we first thought, it’s not just a bit of a shunt, he’s badly hurt.”  Freddie Flintoff  Freddie Flintoff  James continued: “Whether or not it’ll keep going, I don’t know. I’d love to see it continue. It’s been going for a very long time. I watched it as a kid so I wouldn’t want it to disappear.”  Freddie was taken to hospital after being involved in the accident while shooting for the hit motoring show in Surrey in December.  Earlier this year, BBC Studios said that “under the circumstances” they feel “it would be inappropriate to resume making series 34 of Top Gear at this time”.  A statement continued: “We have sincerely apologised to Freddie and will continue to support him with his recovery.  “We understand this will be disappointing for fans, but it is the right thing to do, and we’ll make a judgment about how best to continue later this year.  “This has also impacted the production team, who we continue to support.”  Freddie – real name Andrew Flintoff – was previously involved in a minor incident when he crashed into a market stall in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, in February 2019.  Months later, in September 2019, he crashed again while driving a three-wheel vehicle at a reported speed of 124mph during filming for Top Gear at Elvington Airfield in Yorkshire. He walked away from the incident unharmed.

"accident","2012-06-08","19:00:00","{""SanRafael"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-06-06T23:02:23","In 2017, Novato resident Joanne Greene promoted multiple interfaith gatherings of local Jews and Muslims, convened a symposium on the Golden Age of Spain and co-led a JCC trip to Spain.  It was a lot of activity for someone who only five years prior had been hit by a car.  In her first book, “By Accident: A Memoir of Letting Go,” Greene, 69, assiduously recounts the impact of that accident — as well as a series of other ordeals — on her psyche and her life.  Formerly the director of Jewish engagement at the Osher Marin JCC, Greene writes that the accident proved to be “a catalyst for me, a sudden graphic stop to my constantly-in-motion existence, my need to produce and achieve to feel worthy of love, my need to control everything because I’ve believed it would make me safer.”  The JCC in San Rafael, in conjunction with Congregation Rodef Sholom and Copperfield Books, will host Greene for a reading and book signing on June 25, five days after the book’s publication date. (It’s already available as an audiobook on Audible.)  One day 11 years ago, Greene left work at the JCC and stepped into a crosswalk on North San Pedro Road. The car to the right of her stopped, but a truck behind that car did not, colliding with the car and pushing it forward. Greene was lifted onto the car’s hood, then thrown hard to the ground. The impact left her with multiple fractures of her pelvis and other serious injuries. Recovery would challenge her as nothing before had.  Born in 1954, Joanne Rosenzweig grew up near Boston in a fairly typical, close-knit Jewish family. After media studies at Northwestern University, she earned her bachelor of fine arts in communication arts at Emerson College. Making her way to the Bay Area, she launched a successful career in radio, including stints at KRE, KSAN (where she met her husband, Fred Greene, a producer), KFRC (where she spent 13 years as public affairs director then news director) and KGO (where she served as a fill-in talk show host).  It was while raising her two sons with Fred that she reengaged with Judaism. She got involved at Rodef Sholom, served three years as board chair of the Union for Reform Judaism’s Camp Newman, and in 2009 took the position of director of the Koret Center for Jewish Peoplehood at the Osher Marin JCC.  In an interview, she described herself pre-accident as a woman who took pride in accomplishment and set high standards for herself — as a professional, wife, mother, daughter, woman and feminist. She was the kind of person who was in perpetual motion from morning to night.  A broken pelvis put all that on pause. She is still high-achieving, but her accident forced her to surrender some of the pillars of her personality: independence, constant activity, and the illusion of control. The process of realigning her psyche was arguably as painful as the physical ordeal of healing.  We don’t have control over what happens to us but we absolutely have control over how we respond.  Some six months after the accident, she believed herself ready to return to work, even though the word “stress” now had new and unmanageable dimensions.  She reduced her hours to half-time, but “the universe,” as she is wont to say, had further challenges in store for her: a cancerous colon tumor, a benign tumor in her lungs and a hurricane in Mexico that confronted her with a near-death experience.  Greene had been keeping a journal as part of her coping strategy, and began writing a book after leaving the JCC in 2019.  “If I had to boil it all down,” Greene said, “what I wanted to offer my readers is this: Life is gonna happen, and loss, injury, illness; for some, divorce, or getting fired from jobs. We don’t have control over what happens to us but we absolutely have control over how we respond.”  Greene said she leaned on her husband for strength as the days of recovery turned into months and years. Indeed, she said, “Someone told me the book reads like a love letter to my husband. He was extraordinary.”  She also drew on Jewish tradition and community for support. “No question: Jewish wisdom helped me enormously,” she said. “I saw all of what was happening as opportunities for growth, to become a better person. And I think that’s a very spiritual approach. Which is not to say it was easy or that I was always successful.”  Greene explained, “We are descendants of survivors. It is no accident that my grandparents left Europe for a better life, fleeing the pogroms, fleeing persecution and lack of economic opportunity. They came to this country not speaking a word of English, pulled themselves up by their bootstraps, dealt with challenge after challenge, and were undaunted. I feel like that’s deep in my DNA, as it is in the DNA of many J. readers. I’m sure that will resonate.”  With her background in radio, Greene in 2021 co-created the podcast “All the F-Words” with Gabi Moskowitz, a Bay Area writer. Taking off from virtually any word that starts with F, the co-hosts discuss issues from fanaticism to firearms to feng shui to FOMO (fear of missing out). Moskowitz, who lives a few blocks from the Greenes and is raising two small children, says she enjoys their conversations both on air and off.  “Joanne is a living embodiment of ‘don’t sweat the small stuff.’ She is so good at rising above adversity large and small,” Moskowitz said. “But it’s not just the literal words of her advice. It’s her tone. The energy she gives off is so comforting because you can see how unruffled she is by challenges. Her perspective and wisdom touch everything.”  In 2023, Greene created a second podcast with her husband. “In This Story … with Joanne Greene” features micro-essays by Greene set to music and sound effects.  Both podcasts are available on all major podcast platforms.  While the radio medium suits her as much now as it ever did, writing the book provided an important sense of completion.  “It feels good to have captured my learnings,” she said.  “By Accident: A Memoir of Letting Go” by Joanne Greene (She Writes Press, 177 pages).

"accident","2023-06-06","Not Discerned","{""Hokitika"", ""WestCoast"", ""NewZealand""}","2023-06-06T17:22:26","Lois Williams joins Newsroom after more than three decades as a senior Radio New Zealand journalist and more recently as a Local Democracy reporter on the West Coast.  News  Accident shows DoC risking another Cave Creek  A tramper who fell 16m from a Department of Conservation swing bridge was a victim of mismanagement, a former ranger claims  A senior DoC ranger who threw in his job over lax safety standards says the department is playing down the seriousness of an accident in which a tramper fell from a West Coast swing bridge after slipping through inadequate safety netting.  Dave Hawes, who worked for the Conservation Department on the Coast for 14 years, says he was so worried by escalating risks that he wrote to DoC director general Penny Nelson last year urging her to investigate.  “We have a structural management problem that has taken us back to Cave Creek levels of disconnect and resulting risk to public and staff … your health and safety team are completely disconnected from front-line reality,” Hawes wrote.  The Cave Creek disaster involved the collapse of a DoC West Coast viewing platform in which 14 people died.  The accident on the Collier Gorge swing bridge south of Hokitika illustrates his concerns, says Hawes, and there have been other potentially fatal incidents that he says reflect a lack of field skills and experience within DoC.  In a report released to media this week DoC reviews the June 2020 accident in which a Christchurch tramper was left hanging from the bridge by his pack before plunging into the Whitcombe River narrowly missing large rocks.  The man’s feet slipped sideways and he fell between the deck of the bridge and polythene barrier netting that had detached from its fastenings, the report says.  “The tramper’s pack snagged on the bridge holding their fall, but they could not regain the bridge deck and slipped out of the pack and fell 16m landing between rocks in water deep enough to cushion their fall.”  The man was swept down the river and managed to clamber out suffering only cuts and bruises.  Christchurch Tramping Club captain Bryce Williamson says the man was experienced at crossing swing bridges including the three wire type that have no barrier netting.  “He was reasonably staunch about it - he went on to finish the tramp after a change of clothes.  “But he was pretty shaken and a bit traumatised. He was left dangling by his pack straps over the drop and the rocks.  “He had enough time to try for the right spot but I’d say nine out of 10 times someone in that situation would have died.”  The group leader had tried to pull the man up but could not and rightly kept the others off the weight-restricted bridge, Williamson says.  “The last thing they needed was for the bridge to collapse and take others with it. The only way out for him was to drop into the river.”  Hopelessly underresourced  Williamson is reluctant to fault DoC for the close call saying only that the bridge was clearly not in an “appropriate” condition and the department is hopelessly underresourced.  Hawes has no such reservations.  “There were so many fail points here. They were using trawler netting and they were attaching it to the bridge deck and the first wire with steel loop ties.  “You have a moving structure and that’s never going to hold - the netting breaks away and DoC knew that.”  That’s borne out in an earlier report that says: “Nylon mesh wears through at these sites and may be not the best type to use, especially when we’re using it to prevent falls.”  And DoC staff who inspected Collier Gorge bridge three months before the accident found the netting detached in places, the report says.  That alone should have triggered a rethink, Hawes says.  Dave Hawes quit DoC out of fear of involvement in a fatal accident. Photo: Supplied  “So what do they do? They fasten it back in exactly the same way. It’s like Einstein’s definition of insanity.  “There’s a serious competence and skill-set issue right there. An experienced person would have thought, hang on, this isn’t working, how do we make it safe?”  The workers had also cut the netting in two lengthwise, leaving it weaker on the cut edge and compounding the risk, Hawes says.  “There was trawler netting on bridges in my patch when I was leading ranger teams, but it was wrapped right under the deck and up the other side.  “It wasn’t in two pieces.”  Rolling out replacements  After the accident DoC ordered the gradual replacement of the polyethylene netting with steel mesh.  Heritage and visitors director Cat Wilson says at the time of the mishap 116 of DoC’s old-style swing bridges had barrier netting, but there was no specific policy on installing it.  Work on replacing the netting has been prioritised according to risk and is almost complete, she says.  “Remediation work on two remaining bridges has been planned; these bridges are temporarily closed and/or are regarded as low-risk through consultation with DoC engineers.”  Two investigations followed the Collier Gorge accident, one involving the team who worked on the bridge and one by a DoC engineering manager.  And an online system was set up for reporting visitor accidents.  Hawes doesn’t think that’s enough.  “They pretty much swept this under the carpet — it should have sparked a full ICAM [incident cause analysis method] inquiry that would have revealed deficiencies in staff training and experience and the failures of management to ensure those things were in place.”  What keeps the former ranger awake at night, though, are more recent incidents than Collier Gorge.  “Because they’ve lost so many staff and the budgets are slashed to hell, they have to prioritise high-risk stuff like this.  “But that means they’re not doing the basics any more like track clearing and in doing that they’ve created a whole new risk to the public.”  Another near miss  Hawes is thinking about a mother and children who lost their way on an overgrown track in the Robinson Valley a couple of years ago trying to find the Lake Christabel hut.  “The track was overgrown and had completely disappeared at one point and it was getting on dark.  “They were bushed and had to spend the night in the open.  “They were just lucky the weather was fine. It could have ended badly.”  In the past when DoC had the budget for it the track would have been regularly inspected and put on the work programme before it became dangerously overgrown, he says.  The near miss that sticks in his mind – and the one that led to his quitting in January this year – involved an untrained DoC worker flouting operating rules by trying to fell a large tree on a track using a digger.  “He told the young guy he was working with to climb on the suspended trunk and hack through the root ball. He broke every bloody safety rule in the book.  “Fortunately the young bloke refused and videoed it on his phone.”  Hawes says in another incident a worker new to the job started unloading equipment from the rear of a helicopter close to a hut while the tail rotor was still spinning.  “His supervisor was supposed to be there but wasn’t.  “If he’d hit the rotor the machine could have spun and killed him and the pilot and the people on the hut veranda.  “The chopper pilot nearly lost it, and I don’t blame him, but he got hauled over the coals.  “It was butt-covering by DoC management and it was about a lack of experience and supervision.”  Hawes quit two years earlier than he intended worn down, he says, by the stress of trying to keep visitors safe and assets in good shape without the necessary resources.  “You look at something like the Collier Gorge accident and it’s like all the holes in the Swiss cheese slices are lining up again.  “I don’t want to be around to see people killed.”  Made with the support of the Public Interest Journalism Fund","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3Nyb29tLmNvLm56L25ld3MvYWNjaWRlbnQtc2hvd3MtZG9jLXJpc2tpbmctYW5vdGhlci1jYXZlLWNyZWVr0gFTaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3c3Jvb20uY28ubnovbmV3cy9hY2NpZGVudC1zaG93cy1kb2Mtcmlza2luZy1hbm90aGVyLWNhdmUtY3JlZWs_YW1wPTE?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

He told New Age that they rushed to the spot after receiving news and rescued 11 bodies and 10 seriously injured people from there and sent the wounded to the hospital in a critical condition.  ‘Earlier at noon, local people also sent several injured people to the hospital after rescuing them from the spot,’ he said, adding that the death toll might increase.  Several-kilometre-long traffic congestion was created on both sides of the highway in Nazirbazar area following the deadly road crash and traffic movement on the Dhaka-Sylhet highway became normal around 8:30am three hours after the accident.  As news spread, relatives of the victims crowded into the premises of SOMCH and the hospital atmosphere became heavy with the cries of the victims’ near and dear ones.  Sher Islam, one of the survivors and also a construction contractor, who was undergoing treatment at the SOMCH, told New Age that the sylhet-bound truck was coming from the opposite direction through the left side of the road.  ‘When the truck was about 50 feet away from our pickup van, it suddenly swerved to the right side of the road while at the same time the driver of our vehicle also turned the steering to the right, thereby causing the accident,’ he said.  Another survivor Pallab, 25, told journalists that the speeding truck was moving along the wrong side of the road and collided head-on with their vehicle.  ‘My head stuck at something after the collision and I cannot remember anything after that moment,’ he added.  State minister for shipping Khalid Mahmud Chowdhury, who was visiting Sylhet, rushed to the hospital to see the accident victims immediately after landing in Sylhet Osmani International Airport in the morning.  The junior minister arrived in Sylhet on Wednesday morning to attend a scholarship-awarding ceremony of an educational institution at Osmani Nagar upazila and to inspect Shewla Land Port at Biyanibazar upazila in the district.  ‘The government will stand beside the affected families and provide all kinds of cooperation,’ he said.  Khalid Mahmud also announced financial assistance of Tk 20,000 to the family of each victim on behalf of the government.  He also said that the government would bear medical expenses of the injured.  At that time, the Awami League nominated mayoral candidate for Sylhet City Corporation election Anwaruzzaman Chowdshury and SOMCH director Brigadier General Mahbubur Rahman Bhuiyan were with the state minister.  Sylhet deputy commissioner Md Mojibar Rahman told New Age that the district administration allotted Tk 20,000 to the deceased families and Tk 10,000 to each of the injured.  Anwaruzzaman also announced that each of the deceased families would be provided with Tk 25,000.  Dakshin Surma police officer-in-charge Kamrul Hasan Talukder said that they seized the truck and the pickup van from the spot, but the drivers of the vehicles could not be traced out.  ‘It is possible to confirm now whether the drivers of the two vehicles are alive or they have escaped the scene after the accident,’ he said.  ‘We are busy making preparations to hand over the bodies to their families after completion of all formalities.’  The police officer added that additional district magistrate Imrul Hasan passed an order to hand over the bodies to their relatives without post-mortem examinations following applications filed by the families concerned.  ‘Izazul, son of Sayed Nur, one of the road accident victims, wanted to file a case with the police on behalf of the deceased,’ he said, adding that preparation to file the case also was underway.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld2FnZWJkLm5ldC9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMzYxMC8xMy1wZW9wbGUta2lsbGVkLWluLXN5bGhldC1yb2FkLWFjY2lkZW500gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

MARIGOT--A vehicle accident occurred at the entrance to Baie Rouge around 2:00am Monday when the driver misjudged the bend in the road and lost control.  The Fire Brigade (pompiers) responded first to this accident which, according to the Gendarmerie, involved a “powerful, heavy, pickup vehicle” with four people on board.  “The young driver, who did not test positive for alcohol or drugs, was driving this vehicle for the first time and it seems his speed was excessive,” said Gendarmerie Commandant Lieutenant-Colonel Maxime Wintzer. “The vehicle rolled over several times. The passengers were shocked and concussed, but were able to get out of the vehicle before it burst into flames.”  The victims were transported to hospital while the pompiers extinguished the fire.  “High displacement vehicles should not be driven like city cars. In any case, there are speed limits when there are bends in the road. Ignoring speed limits is a recipe for accidents,” Wintzer said.  A similar accident occurred in the same place a few weeks ago, although neither the Gendarmes nor pompiers were called out at that time. It was thought the occupants walked away from that accident unharmed.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5aGVyYWxkLnN4L2lzbGFuZHMvZm91ci1pbmp1cmVkLWluLWJhaWUtcm91Z2UtYWNjaWRlbnQtbW9uZGF5LW1vcm5pbmfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Henry Dunn, 23, spent 11 months travelling across southeast Asia, New Zealand and then Australia before he was injured last November.  He was involved in a “serious accident” just a week before he was due to leave the cattle ranch in the Northern Territory he had spent three months working on.  Henry was later airlifted to hospital where he underwent emergency surgery which resulted in the amputation of his lower left arm.  He says that under Australia’s Northern Territory Workers’ Compensation Scheme he is unable to sue his employer for negligence under common law and so he needs to fundraise to pay for things “that are not covered by insurance”.  Writing on his GoFundMe page, he said: “This includes things such as specialised equipment for sports and daily living which will enable me to continue participation as well as leisure activities including cycling, Crossfit, gardening, fishing, surfing just to name a few.  “As well as adaptive training courses, charitable events and seminars which will all aid my recovery.  “Any donations you can give will be massively appreciated.  “I will keep you posted on my progress via my Instagram and how the donations you have made improve the quality of my life as an amputee.  “I am optimistic about the future and the challenges to come.”  Before the accident, Henry was determined to see the world after graduating from Cardiff Metropolitan University in 2020.  Unfortunately, the coronavirus pandemic affected his plans, so when the world gradually reopened he jetted off last January.  He initially went to southeast Asia before progressing to New Zealand and Australia.  “In the 11 months of being away, I met amazing people, experienced new cultures, foods, and activities which all aided my personal development and view of the world,” he said.  Since returning to the UK, Henry, from Gloucestershire, has been sharing images and videos of his recovery.  Clips include him having a new prosthetic arm fitted and doing strenuous activities like rowing and lifting weights.  Showcasing a new pin lock prosthetic arm, he wrote: “A new cast had to be created due to the changing of shape of my residual limb. The changing of shape is a positive thing as overtime it has decreased in size.  “The functions are exactly the same as my previous one, but the pin lock system will stop the prosthetic from coming off due to sweat like the previous one did.  “It is far easier to put on and off using a pin lock system as it is basically a quick release and easy to lock in.  “I managed to have a little play on the rower during one of my physio sessions which felt great but maybe at a 20% push.”  Click here to donate to Henry’s GoFundMe appeal.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvLnVrL25ld3MvdWsvaG9tZS1uZXdzL2FtcHV0ZWUtdWstaGVucnktZHVubi1hdXN0cmFsaWEtYjIzNTE3NzAuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

After four days in the hospital, the politician took to Instagram earlier this week, where he shared a photo of himself in polo gear along with a caption explaining the scary accident.  “Out of commission for awhile. Just spent 4 days in the hospital. Had a polo accident,” he wrote. “Broke 7 bones and puncturing my lungs. But don’t worry. I’ll live. If, I don’t die. J/k. I’ll be back in 7 weeks.”  Ravenel added, “When they took the x-rays, they said, ‘You’ve broken these bones before.’ I was a bit surprised. Didn’t know broken bones left scars.”  The former reality star joined Southern Charm’s original cast in 2014 before leaving in 2018 at the end of the show’s fifth season. Bravo announced his exit not long after he was arrested and charged with assault and battery when his children’s nanny accused him of raping her, per People. He eventually pled guilty to third-degree assault and battery in 2019 and his 30-day prison sentence was reduced to a $500 fine and probation.  During his time on the show, he ran as an independent candidate for the U.S. Senate against Lindsey Graham, where he came in third place, earning a mere 3.9% of the vote.  Seven years before his 2014 loss, Ravenel served five months as South Carolina’s treasurer before he was indicted on federal cocaine distribution charges. After attending rehab and pleading guilty, he was sentenced to 10 months in federal prison in 2008.  Another large part of his storyline on the hit Bravo series followed his tumultuous relationship with ex-girlfriend Kathryn Dennis, who was only 21 when she met the then 50-year-old Ravenel. The former couple went on to have two children together before ultimately breaking up in 2016. Dennis — who remained on the series after Ravenel’s departure — has since confirmed that she will not return for Season 9.  Southern Charm is currently streaming on Peacock.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vZGVjaWRlci5jb20vMjAyMy8wNi8wNi9zb3V0aGVybi1jaGFybS10aG9tYXMtcmF2ZW5lbC1ob3NwaXRhbGl6ZWQtcG9sby1hY2NpZGVudC_SAVxodHRwczovL2RlY2lkZXIuY29tLzIwMjMvMDYvMDYvc291dGhlcm4tY2hhcm0tdGhvbWFzLXJhdmVuZWwtaG9zcGl0YWxpemVkLXBvbG8tYWNjaWRlbnQvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Odessa, Texas--(Newsfile Corp. - June 6, 2023) - Reyna Law Firm has announced new expansions, with its personal injury assistance services now accessible for oilfield disaster victims in Artesia, Carlsbad, Hobbs, Jal, Lovington, and Roswell, New Mexico.With the announcement, Reyna Law Firm aims to improve access to personal injury claim representation services in extended regions. Now operating several offices in New Mexico in close proximity to its Odessa, Texas branch, the firm further extends its guidance to victims of severe accidents involving vehicular crashes, workplace negligence, and others.  For more information see https://www.reynainjurylaw.com/odessa      Reyna Law Firm Expands Oilfield Accident Legal Representation To New Mexico  To view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:  https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8814/169065_1412bb4444f14983_001full.jpg  Its latest expansion is primarily carried out in response to oilfield catastrophes in the Permian Basin, known as one of the main footholds of the American oil industry. Workers from West Texas and southeast New Mexico are currently involved in an oil production operation that The Financial Times calls ""booming."" With more employees, though, comes a higher chance of on-the-job injuries.  The dangers associated with oilfields for workers are well-documented, says the firm's lead attorney JR Reyna, pointing to the hazardous materials and unsafe machinery often found at sites. Accordingly, the law firm provides its expanded services to members of the New Mexico oilfield workforce who have sustained serious injuries as a result of poor safety conditions.  Reyna Law Firm's expanded services, now accessible in the New Mexico counties of Eddy, Chaves, and Lea, include initial case reviews where injured parties or their families can outline their situation. Reyna Law Firm's attorneys work to evaluate such cases in order to project where liability lies and map out possible legal avenues to explore in pursuit of compensation.  Once aligned with the goals of its clients, Reyna Law Firm works to negotiate settlements offered by oilfield companies or insurers. If they deem such figures as unsuitable to cover the pain and suffering that oilfield accidents have had on their clients, the injury lawyers are able to take proceedings to court.  Further, Reyna Law Firm notes that as a contingency-based firm, its clients pay for legal fees only if their injury claim has been successful. Having expanded its services to New Mexico, the firm now offers residents round-the-clock communication - with consultations scheduled online or via its over-the-phone contact options.

"accident","2023-06-07","Not Discerned","{""Baleshwar"", ""Orissa"", ""India""}","2023-06-07T06:48:19","Five days after the disastrous Odisha train accident, the agony continues for the families of the victims. Hundreds of bodies are piling up in hospitals in and around Balasore as kin find it difficult to identify them. The triple collision led to corpses being badly damaged, making it nearly impossible for kin to identify them.  Already heartbroken, families are struggling to find missing relatives and claim bodies. So far more than 280 people have died and around 177 bodies have been identified. More than 100 others need to be handed over.  The fight over bodies  Chaos and confusion prevail with several families squabbling over bodies. Two families, one from Howrah and another from north Dinajpur, clashed over a dead victim.  Jahangir Midday (42) and Anjarul Haque (41) both have been declared dead in the Odisha train tragedy. Both were wearing identical clothes, according to the police.  Midday’s body, which had multiple injuries and was decomposed, was handed over to his brother after it was identified at AIIMS, Bhubaneswar, reports The Times of India (ToI). They were later told that some other family had claimed the same body.  However, this is not an isolated case.  Mohammed Imam Ul Haq from Bihar faced a similar dilemma. The body of his brother is still missing and the one which he said is that of his 12-year-old nephew is being claimed by another family, reports Reuters.  “We are Muslim, boys are circumcised at birth; however, the body is in no condition to even check that,” Haq said of the remains he believes are of his nephew.  Several families who have been waiting for days said that the bodies of their relatives are being released to someone else.  Also read: Odisha: What’s electronic interlocking system & could Kavach have prevented it?  DNA testing  The only way out is to conduct a DNA test on the dead. Authorities had taken DNA samples from all the dead bodies in hospitals across the state, Prateek Singh, a senior police official, told the media on Tuesday.  Some of these samples will be reportedly sent to Delhi on a flight after which the identity of the bodies will be ascertained.  The DNA samples will be preserved so that there is no problem in the future. Bodies will be handed over to families after verification, only adding to their pain. Authorities say that this process is necessary to ensure transparency and no errors.  “In cases where there are multiple claimants, we have taken DNA samples from family members and we will preserve the bodies until the DNA matches,” Singh told local media.  AIIMS, Bhubaneswar has also started DNA sampling of the claimants. As many as 10 samples have so far been collected from the claimants, a senior official of the hospital told news agency Press Trust of India (PTI).  In a conference held by AIIMS Bhubaneswar Executive Director Ashutosh Biswas and Khurda Divisional Railway Manager Rikesh Ray, they said that at least 52 unidentified bodies are in the hospital.  Also read: Is the Odisha train accident an outcome of sabotage? Why CBI has been called in  The mix-up in bodies  Despite the DNA testing, families say there have been mix-ups. A claimant from, Jharkhand on Tuesday alleged that they had on Monday identified the body of Upendra Kumar Sharma, but it was handed over to someone other on 6 June.  “What is the point of doing DNA sampling if the body has been handed over to someone other? We had identified Upendra from the tattoo mark on his body,” the relative added.  Another grief-stuck mother from Nepal told NDTV that the body of her teenage son was identified but she was informed that it was handed over to some other family.  West Bengal resident Zakaria Laskar has similar woes. The body of his uncle was claimed by a woman from Malda, the report says. “I don’t know the woman’s name. They are just telling me a woman has taken the body,” he told NDTV.  The challenge of preserving remains  However, the problems are only expected to compound for hospital authorities. The hot weather in Odisha poses a big challenge to preserving the remains.  “It was very difficult to store such a large number of bodies with care, identify those and dispatch the bodies to their families after all due formalities,” Dr Biswas said.  AIIMS, Bhubaneswar has procured at least five deep freezer containers from Paradip Port on Monday, which will help store the bodies. According to an official, they can be preserved in these containers for six months.  A group of 20 medical professionals comprising specialists in anatomy and forensic medicine from central government hospitals in New Delhi like AIIMS, Lady Hardinge and Ram Manohar Lohia, arrived in Balasore to help preserve the bodies.  Corpses have also been surgically embalmed to delay decomposition but it is a race against time. Yet there are concerns.  Dr Prabhas Ranjan Tripathy, professor of anatomy at AIIMS Bhubaneswar, told Hindustan Times that embalming should be done within six to 12 hours of the death. A delay causes it to lose effectiveness and decompose quickly. “The accident happened during the summer so that has exacerbated the process. Also if the body is damaged, embalming is difficult,” he said.  The challenges continue for medical experts as Odisha struggles to pick up the pieces. But the plight of relatives is heartbreaking, they have no time to mourn leave alone come to terms.

None of us really knew how serious it was,” the star told the publication of the aftermath. “I think anything like that, it’s an immediate realization of, ‘Wow, any of us can go at any minute…’ ""  The Snow White and the Huntsman actor also admitted that approaching a milestone birthday later this year has made him think about how quickly life is passing him by. “I don’t think I wanna turn 40,” he told the outlet. “I still feel like I’m 25 and I’ve got heaps of time. Now I’m like, ‘Oh, I could be halfway. More than halfway.’ ”  “It is a lot of time,” he continued. “If I get there! The reality of, ‘I’m not going to be here forever’ is sinking in.”    Renner's December 2022 incident saw him break over 30 bones and undergo multiple surgeries after being run over by a 7-ton snow plow. The actor had been clearing snow from his driveway and for neighbors.  Hemsworth was quick to send his well wishes to the Hawkeye star when Renner posted on Instagram from hospital and thanked everyone for their support just days after the accident. “Speedy recovery buddy. Sending love your way!"" he wrote in the comments section.  More than four months removed from the incident, he appears to remain on course in his recovery. While he has not yet announced any future film roles, Renner walked his first red carpet since the incident last month at the Los Angeles premiere of his Disney+ reality series Rennervations.  On May 19, the star shared a video of himself lightly jogging on a Boost Microgravity Treadmill that he wrote was his ""first attempt at a light jog"" since the accident.  Over Memorial Day weekend, he returned to Lake Tahoe for what he implied in an Instagram caption was a visit with his loved ones. ""Home,"" the Hawkeye actor wrote above a picture of jet skis.""    Chris Hemsworth. Georges Antoni  Elsewhere in the British GQ interview, Hemsworth opened up life with Pataky, who he married in 2010, just months after meeting her.    The Thor actor shared that their relationship had gone “so fast,” and explained to the publication that there was a time when key milestones in his professional and family life were happening at once.  “We were having kids the same time my career was taking off, same time we were getting married, same time we were getting to know each other,"" he said. ""It feels like we got to know each other halfway through our relationship, five, six years ago. In a beautiful way. Once our kids were out of nappies, things became a bit more manageable.”  Adding he wouldn’t be where he is today without the Spanish actress, Hemsworth continued: “Her sacrifice, commitment, work, support, forgiveness – everything that she has given me over the years has been incredible. I couldn’t have done any of the things I’ve done without it.    The couple both regularly post to social media celebrating family life, including a hilarious post that celebrated his twin sons' 9th birthday earlier this year.    Elsa Pataky and Chris Hemsworth. Lisa Maree Williams/Getty Images  On March 19, Hemsworth posted a family pic to Instagram that had been snapped as his wife pushed one of their sons face-first into a chocolate cake. ""Happy 9th birthday to my two little men!"" Hemsworth wrote on the fun-loving family pic. ""Only one way to eat cake in this house and that's to have mum slam your head into it face first!!""  ""'Hey mum I don't like chocolate cake I prefer vanilla,' "" the actor teased. ""'Oh really son, what about now?'

The accident occurred on northbound Interstate 476 at 5:00 a.m., close to mile marker 15.4, between exits 13 (U.S. Route 30 to St. Davids/Villanova) and 16A (Pennsylvania Route 23/Interstate 76).  News footage showed the truck cab was pressed up against the side of the trailer as though the vehicle had jackknifed and run off the road. Behind the vehicle was a smashed white vehicle on the pavement. The U-Haul trailer the white vehicle was towing was also smashed into a lamppost.  Around the time the road was reopened late Monday morning, Pennsylvania State Police reported that a woman had died at the site. However, PSP troopers did not specify which car the individual was traveling in.  An investigation remains ongoing, and no additional details about the other injured victims have been provided. PSP troopers will release further information as it becomes available.  Our thoughts and best wishes for a full recovery go out to the injured victims.  Truck Accidents in Philadelphia  Even while the incidence of truck crashes in Pennsylvania may be smaller than the rate of other kinds of collisions, the outcomes of truck collisions are virtually invariably catastrophic. In only one year, almost 110,000 Americans had significant injuries directly from being involved in an accident with such a large vehicle.  In actuality, there has been around a 25% rise in fatal truck accidents across the country over the last decade. Regrettably, the rate of truck accidents has increased in Pennsylvania.  If you were injured in an accident involving a commercial vehicle that was not your fault, it goes without saying that you should consider your legal options with an experienced attorney as soon as possible after receiving medical treatment.  If you were not at fault for the accident but sustained serious injuries, the person who caused the collision may be forced to pay your medical expenses and lost income.  If a driver is permanently disabled due to injuries, an insurance company may look for loopholes to avoid paying for long-term care or lost income and earning potential. Even if the victims’ injuries were not their fault, businesses and major insurance conglomerates might try to avoid paying to protect their bottom line.

"accident","2023-11-12","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-06-06T23:19:00","The investigation continues into Sunday’s fatal flight of a 1990 Cessna Citation 560, which crashed in Virginia killing all four occupants. Incapacitation due to hypoxia, most likely resulting from a pressurization issue, is strongly suspected, as the Citation pilot stopped responding to radio calls 15 minutes into the flight, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. Also, the Citation apparently followed the lateral track of its flight-planned path, turning toward and then overflying its destination, New York Long Island McArthur Airport (KISP). But it flew the flight-planned path at 34,000 feet and continued on a consistent track until apparently running out of fuel and spiraling to the ground at a high rate of descent.  Further, according to reporting in The New York Times, pilots of F-16 fighters that were scrambled to intercept the business jet (alarming residents and government officials around Washington, D.C., with sonic booms) reported seeing the pilot slumped over the controls and unresponsive to radio calls and flares.  Much of the news coverage focuses on the widely heard and recorded sonic booms, which were authorized by NORAD due to the Citation’s track overflying—but not penetrating—Washington’s restricted airspace, which caps at 18,000 feet. But the unknowns surrounding the circumstances of the actual accident flight are drawing more attention from the aviation community.  As yet unanswered is what caused the Citation to turn toward the destination airport, then fly on at 34,000 feet on what appears to be a direct line back toward the departure airport in Elizabethton, Tennessee (0A9). Perhaps coincidentally, that heading also corresponds closely to the final track of the Runway 24 ILS approach at KISP. Investigators are exploring whether the flight management system (FMS) commanded the autopilot to fly the lateral track of a programmed flight plan after the pilot lost consciousness. As shown on flight tracking service FlightAware, the Citation followed a normally assigned IFR routing, which includes a dogleg over the Sea Isle VOR in southern New Jersey, to help remain clear of more congested airspace farther inland.  The incident is similar to the hypoxia-related Learjet crash that killed golfer Payne Stewart in October 1999. Except in that case, the aircraft did not make any autopilot-generated turns. Intercepting fighters tracked the Learjet on a straight line until it, too, ran out of fuel and spiraled to the ground near Mina, South Dakota.  Some observers (including AVweb readers commenting on our initial coverage of the accident on Sunday night) suggested that the pilot might have included the departure airport in the original flight plan as a check to see if there was enough fuel on board to return—and never removed the waypoint. Thus, the Citation would have continued on autopilot back toward the departure airport at the programmed altitude. After engine flameout from fuel exhaustion, the autopilot would have raised the nose attempting to maintain the programmed altitude until the aircraft stalled and spiraled to the ground.  The aircraft owner, reportedly a pilot, told The New York Times the passengers were his daughter, two-year-old granddaughter and the child’s nanny. They were returning to their home on Long Island, New York, after visiting him at his home in North Carolina.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF2d2ViLmNvbS9hdmlhdGlvbi1uZXdzL2h5cG94aWEtc3VzcGVjdGVkLWluLW15c3RlcmlvdXMtY2l0YXRpb24tZmF0YWwtYWNjaWRlbnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(WCVB) – A woman in Massachusetts was working at her dream job when motherhood came calling.  Isabel Miller stepped away from her role as a fashion designer to raise her son.  That son though, became her new model – leading her back to the career she loved so much.  Miller is the owner of Hedgehog Belly Design, an infant and children’s wear clothing company she founded in her hometown of Framingham.  “Ever since growing up I probably have known that I wanted to have a store, my own company,” she said.  Miller’s journey to creating her own company first started in New York City.  After graduating college with a degree in fashion design and production, she landed a job at Marc Jacobs working in their brand-new children’s wear line.  Burberry in London was the next stop.  But when motherhood called, it was time to come home and eventually embark on her own clothing line and business.  “I went from having a team, like of people. So, I would sketch my idea and be like here make it. And now I’m like drafting the pattern. I’m making the prototype. I’m grading out all the patterns,” Miller explained.  Miller admits her clothing line was a happy accident. She was making outfits for her son when other moms started to take notice.  “I designed this one pair of pants, and I would send him to day care and people were like, ‘Oh! Where did you get those pants? Those are so cute,’” Miller said.  Miller says when it comes to creating a successful kid clothing company, it’s key to remember not only who’s buying it, but who’s wearing it as well.  “Everything is always machine washable,” Miller said. “Everything is always soft to the touch and comfortable. And I try to always have everything be natural fibers or predominantly natural fibers.”  Copyright 2023 WCVB via CNN Newsource.

None of the six children who were passengers on the Regional School Unit 18 bus were injured, but two others in another vehicle required medical treatment, according to a release from Shannon Moss, spokesperson for the Maine Department of Public Safety.  Tuesday’s crash was the second serious collision involving a school bus within the past week. A 13-year-old Gray-New Gloucester Middle School student was struck and seriously injured when a tractor-trailer truck apparently failed to stop for a school bus on May 30.  On Tuesday, the RSU 18 school bus was stopped and letting children off when it was struck from behind. The bus’s stop lights were activated at the time.  A Dodge Caravan operated by 24-year-old Michael Grier Jr. of Belgrade struck the rear-end of a Ford Fusion that was legally stopped behind the bus. The force of the collision pushed the Fusion into the rear of the bus where it became wedged beneath it.  Occupants of the Fusion were taken to a local hospital and released. The driver and passenger in the Caravan were not injured. There were six children and a driver on the bus.  Advertisement  There have been 411 crashes involving school buses in Maine since the beginning of 2019, according to the Bureau of Highway Safety. Three were fatal crashes – one in 2019 and two in 2022 – and injuries were reported in 68 of the crashes. So far this year, there have been 37 crashes involving school buses, 10 involving injuries.  The 13-year-old Gray-New Gloucester Middle School student was hit by the truck while crossing Lewiston Road (Route 100) in Gray. Police and school officials say the bus was stopped at a regular bus stop with its flashing lights and flashing stop arm engaged.  School and family members say the student suffered significant injuries.  The teen hasn’t been identified, but his mother, Heather Phillips, started a GoFundMe fundraiser to help cover medical costs and the family’s expenses in the coming weeks. As of Tuesday, she has raised more than $23,000.  The boy is going to be taken to Boston where he will undergo rehabilitation treatment at Mass General Brigham Spaulding Rehabilitation Center, according to his mother.

(WALA) - We’re hearing from the grieving family of a 15-year-old killed in a UTV accident over the weekend in Stockton.  Houston Glass just finished his freshman year at McGill-Toolen with a big future ahead.  Now, his mom and dad are remembering their joyful son.  FOX10 News’s Lacey Beasley sat down with Houston’s mother and some family, and through tears, they recalled many silly, goofy stories of him.  They describe Houston as young, energetic, and kind. A 15-year-old outdoorsman, as his family calls him, and a lover of hunting, fishing, dancing, and cooking. His mother, Jennifer, said he just killed his first turkey and was so proud of it. He one day hoped to attend the University of Alabama or maybe enlist in the military.  His dad Glenn Glass sent some words about his son:  “Houston was the kindest, most polite, most courageous, and most loving son anyone could ever ask for. Everyone that knew him, loved him. He loved his family, his friends, and the outdoors. He was a hunter and an avid fisherman, but most importantly, he was my best friend. He was a wonderful son, and our family will miss him always.”  His mother, Jennifer Randolph sent this:  “Houston was a vibrant, adventurous, and an entertaining person. He had a bright spirit that brought energy to any group that he was part of. Early days, he enjoyed sports and being with teammates, but then he found his true love of the outdoors – hunting, fishing, anything that was outside and dirty.  Most of all, Houston was kind and loving – his love for his family was deep – he couldn’t wait for his sisters to get home from college; he loved spending time with his dad at the hunting camp; and he never failed to remind his mom that she was the best, most beautiful person he knew. Life won’t be the same without his silly songs, his impromptu dancing, off the wall jokes, and mostly his warm strong hugs.”  A memorial mass for Houston is at St. Ignatius 8:15 a.m. Wednesday.

The “Big Bang Theory” star, 37, shared on Apple’s “SmartLess” podcast that she broke her leg 12 or 13 years ago after falling off a horse.  “It was a bad accident, it was a very bad accident,” she told co-hosts Jason Bateman, Will Arnett and Sean Hayes.  The fall itself didn’t break any bones, she explained, but she was seriously injured when the horse stepped on her leg.  “I remember clear as day, because it takes a second when something is that bad,"" she said. “I was like, ‘Did I just fall on a whole thing of leaves?’ Because I heard all the cracking. … It took me like five or 10 seconds to actually realize it wasn’t just 400 leaves, it was my bones.”  Cuoco said she suffered a compound fracture of her tibia and fibula, the two bones that connect the ankle to the knee, causing the bones to pierce through the skin of her lower leg.  “It just was a horrible, horrible, horrible break,” she said.  She said she underwent surgery following the gruesome accident. Before going under anesthesia, she had to sign a release allowing doctors to amputate her leg if needed.  Luckily, doctors were able to save her limb, and they inserted pins and rods in her leg that remain there to this day.  “I’ve got some good scars,” Cuoco said. “It makes you feel like a badass.”  She added that while doctors didn’t think she would walk for three months, she was “walking in a week with a boot,” and was back to filming “The Big Bang Theory” within two weeks.  “It was miraculous,” she said.  The actor, who stars in Peacock's new dark comedy series, ""Based on a True Story,"" is known for her love of horses and other animals.

Cuoco's horse seemed intrigued by Matilda. @kaleycuoco via Instagram  “Finally Tildy met her barn friends today!” she captioned a photo in her Instagram story.  Cuoco and her partner, “Ozark” star Tom Pelphrey, welcomed baby Matilda on March 30.  “Introducing, Matilda Carmine Richie Pelphrey, the new light of our lives!” she wrote on Instagram a few days after Matilda was born. “We are overjoyed and grateful for this little miracle.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvZGF5LmNvbS9oZWFsdGgva2FsZXktY3VvY28taG9yc2UtcmlkaW5nLWFjY2lkZW50LXJjbmE4Nzg3N9IBKWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvZGF5LmNvbS90b2RheS9hbXAvcmNuYTg3ODc3?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"accident","2023-05-21","Not Discerned","{""SanFrancisco"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-06-06T20:40:55","A Waymo robotaxi operating in autonomous mode struck and killed a small dog last month in San Francisco, according to an incident report filed with the California Department of Motor Vehicles. The incident appears to have been unavoidable, based on information provided in the report.  Any collision involving an autonomous vehicle — even one in which the company is not at fault — can cause a backlash, particularly in a city like San Francisco, where there is already tension between city officials, AV tech companies and the public. If technological capability and a favorable regulatory environment are two legs of a solid AV commercialization stool, public perception is the crucial third. And a self-driving car killing a sweet pooch has the potential to kick out that third leg.  It also comes at a critical time for the industry and, specifically, for Waymo, which is expanding its robotaxi network in Phoenix and gearing up to charge fares for fully autonomous (meaning no human behind the wheel) rides in San Francisco.  According to the report, one of Waymo’s self-driving Jaguar I-Pace cars was traveling on Toland Street, a low-speed street near Waymo’s depot, and the dog ran into the street. The vehicle was operating in autonomous mode, and a human safety operator was in the driver’s seat at the time of the accident.  The human operator didn’t see the dog, but the vehicle’s autonomous system did. However, a number of factors, including the speed and trajectory of the dog’s path, made the collision unavoidable, according to Waymo.  In response to our questions about the incident, Waymo sent TechCrunch the following statement:  On May 21 in San Francisco, a small dog ran in front of one of our vehicles with an autonomous specialist present in the driver’s seat, and, unfortunately, contact was made. The investigation is ongoing, however the initial review confirmed that the system correctly identified the dog which ran out from behind a parked vehicle but was not able to avoid contact. We send our sincere condolences to the dog’s owner. The trust and safety of the communities we are in is the most important thing to us and we’re continuing to look into this on our end.  Neither the safety operator nor the autonomous system braked to avoid collision, according to Waymo. In both cases, that’s because of the “unusual path” the dog took at “a high rate of speed directly towards the side of the vehicle,” said a Waymo spokesperson.  One of the ways Waymo evaluates its autonomous driver’s collision avoidance performance is by comparing it to that of a model for a non-impaired, with eyes always on the conflict (NIEON) human driver. A Waymo spokesperson told TechCrunch that the company reconstructed last month’s event in simulation against the NIEON model, but the analysis showed a collision in this case was unavoidable.  Sagar Behere, VP of safety at AV verification and validation startup Foretellix, told TechCrunch that timing is a key factor in an AV’s ability to avoid collision. (Behere spoke to TechCrunch about AV technology generally, and not about Waymo specifically.)  “If you saw the object, when did you see it? Did you see it in time to be able to act on it and make a good evasive maneuver?” said Behere. “Or maybe you saw it and predicted it would move in a way that required you to take no action? Or maybe you were about to take action, but then the object changed course.”  Despite Waymo’s potential for plausible deniability here, the company and the industry at large are still at risk of a downturn in public perception, which could make AV expansion plans more difficult.  Recent studies show that public perception around autonomous vehicles is improving, albeit slowly and mainly in regard to lower levels of automated driving like advanced driver assistance systems. People trust advanced driver assistance systems in today’s new vehicles (systems that require a human to be ready to take control) over fully autonomous vehicles when it comes to crash prevention, according to a study from the AAA’s Foundation for Traffic Safety, which collected responses from 2018 to 2020  Another study that collected nearly 6,000 responses between February and June 2022 found that trust in AVs decreases after a crash, while levels of concern increase. However, those with prior knowledge of AVs are more optimistic toward the technology, even after a crash, because they generally accept that AVs will not always make the right decisions at early stages of adoption.  Public perception aside, Waymo could face investigations from regulatory bodies like the National Highway Traffic Association. NHTSA requires manufacturers and operators of high-level autonomous vehicles to submit incident reports for crashes if the autonomous driving system was in use at any time within 30 seconds of the crash and the crash resulted in property damage or injury. The agency told TechCrunch it had reached out to Waymo for more information, but has no open investigations into the company at this time.  In 2018, when an autonomous vehicle from Uber’s now-shuttered AV unit hit and killed a pedestrian, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) launched an investigation. Usually, the NTSB launches a highway investigation when there’s been a significant crash that highlights a potential national safety issue. A spokesperson from the agency told TechCrunch she doesn’t believe NTSB has any current investigations involving Waymo.  This article has been updated with NHTSA’s statement.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyMy8wNi8wNi9hLXdheW1vLXNlbGYtZHJpdmluZy1jYXIta2lsbGVkLWEtZG9nLWluLXVuYXZvaWRhYmxlLWFjY2lkZW50L9IBZGh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyMy8wNi8wNi9hLXdheW1vLXNlbGYtZHJpdmluZy1jYXIta2lsbGVkLWEtZG9nLWluLXVuYXZvaWRhYmxlLWFjY2lkZW50L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(Spenser Heaps, Deseret News )  Estimated read time: 2-3 minutes  LITTLE COTTONWOOD CANYON — A canyoneer died over the weekend in a rappelling accident in Little Cottonwood Canyon, authorities said.  The canyoneer rappelled off the end of his or her rope on the Great White Icicle and fell 300 feet, resulting in fatal injuries, according to Salt Lake County Sheriff's Search and Rescue. The identity of the canyoneer has not yet been released.  Search and rescue officials said the canyoneer was knowledgeable about the location of the next rappel station but for some reason passed it. The person's partner attempted to signal that the canyoneer had gone too far, but the warning was inaudible due to noise from the water. The partner reached the canyoneer and attempted to administer first aid.  Search and rescue officials say the canyoneers opted not to put knots in the end of their ropes over worry that the ropes would get stuck and become impossible to retrieve in the water.

"accident","2023-05-04","Not Discerned","{""Detroit"", ""Michigan"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-06-06T21:13:00","DETROIT, Mich. (WXYZ) — The fatal bus accident Friday in downtown Detroit was not the first for the driver behind the wheel.  The DDOT veteran who ran over 67-year-old Janice Bauer at the intersection of Congress and Griswold, according to multiple sources, also ran over and killed pedestrian Joey Davis years earlier.  “This was a human life that was lost once, and now we’re faced with this again,” said attorney James Harrington, whose firm represented Davis’s family in 2015. “It’s unacceptable.”  Surveillance video showed that Davis was run over after stepping off the bus and retrieving his bike from the rack at the front.  The driver appears to be looking up at her rearview mirror and didn’t notice Davis was right in front of her when she started driving forward.  “The driver just took off. Horrible accident. No excuse,” said Dan Dirks in 2017, while he was director of DDOT. “One of our customers suffered a fatality.”  Dirks said the bus driver responsible was taken off the road for a year before being retrained and returned to full duty in 2017.  “(She) went through extensive retraining...the last report I heard, which was a couple of days ago, was that she was doing fine,” Dirks said back in 2017.  Reached by phone Tuesday, Joey Davis’s daughter Rachel said she was stunned to learn that the same driver who ran over her father was allowed to remain behind the wheel.  “I feel like the people who let her back were very negligent in their job and her re-training,” Davis said. “I feel like if they had properly done their jobs, another woman wouldn’t have lost their life.”  Harrington and the Fieger law firm sued the city over the 2015 death, settling the case for $4.5 million.  “The right thing would have been to remove her from the road and never allow her to get back behind awheel to allow something like this to happen,” Harrington said.  The bus driver was taken off the road Friday, while an investigation into the fatal accident is ongoing.  “This is an event that never should have happened in any circumstances. It’s broad daylight, and she ran over not only one but two members of our community and killed them,” Harrington said. “How is this tolerated?”  In a statement released Friday, Mayoral spokesman John Roach said, in part, that a review is already ongoing to determine “whether the city has the proper internal and labor relations processes in place to prevent accidents involving the city’s bus operators.”  Contact 7 Investigator Ross Jones at ross.jones@wxyz.com or at (248) 827-9466.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy53eHl6LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvaW52ZXN0aWdhdGlvbnMvaG93LWlzLXRoaXMtdG9sZXJhdGVkLWZhbWlseS1ncmlldmVzLWFmdGVyLWRkb3QtZHJpdmVycy1zZWNvbmQtZmF0YWwtYWNjaWRlbnTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"accident","2019-05-12","21:00:00","{""Cannes"", ""ProvenceAlpesCoteDAzur"", ""France""}","2023-06-05T15:30:40","Slammed at Cannes, Lily-Rose Depp’s The Idol arrives on Sky Atlantic with a lot to live up to. Is it really the sleaziest television ever made? The short answer is yes. The longer answer is yes, and let’s never speak of it again.  Slithering out of the imagination of Euphoria creator Sam Levinson, this music industry drama (Sky Atlantic, 9pm) is so ludicrous there is surely a strong possibility it’s a meta-prank by Levinson and his co-creator Abel Tesfaye. Nobody makes something this dreadful by accident.  Tesfaye is better known as pop star The Weeknd, which is also the length of time he spent taking acting lessons for The Idol. His biggest hit is called Blinding Lights, but here it’s the cardboard performance as a DJ turned pop Svengali that makes you want to cover your eyes.  He plays “Tedros” – not Tetris, as I initially thought – an “enigmatic” hustler who befriends a Britney-esque pop star, Jocelyn. She is portrayed without a whiff of self-awareness by Lily-Rose Depp, daughter of Johnny Depp and Vanessa Paradis. Jocelyn is introduced pouting at the camera in the photo shoot at which she insists on whipping her top off. A party-pooping intimacy coordinator encourages her to cover up – but, in a fearless display of female empowerment, she faces him down and continues disrobing. Take it from the Weeknd: getting your kit off for a sleazy photographer is the new girl bossing.  READ MORE  The Idol comes to the screen fumigated in controversy, with its director Amy Seimetz having quit, supposedly when 80 per cent of filming was complete and allegedly because of creative differences with Tesfaye. According to Rolling Stone, Tesfaye was unhappy that the show had too much of a “female perspective”. “It went from satire to the thing it was satirising,” a crew member complained to Rolling Stone.  Such accusations will not be new to Levinson. With Euphoria, he was charged with spinning a bizarre fantasy of teenagers as over-sexed and drugged-up libertines. That series was partly rescued by lead actress Zendaya, who found hidden depths in Levinson’s shallow script. But Depp either lacks the ability or inclination to put layers on the perpetually semi-naked Jocelyn.  She isn’t helped by dialogue that lands like an intern asked to write “pornographic Stanley Kubrick”. “He’s so rapey,” says Jocelyn’s assistant of Tedros’s character. “I kind of like that about him,” she giggles.  [ Lily-Rose Depp: ‘It’s always a little sad to see mean, false things said about someone you care about’ ]  Tesfaye isn’t required to remove his clothes. However, his dialogue is every bit as toe-curling as Depp’s. “Pop music is the ultimate Trojan horse,” Tedros tells Jocelyn. But isn’t the ultimate Trojan horse… a Trojan horse?  The Weeknd’s music is vapid but seductive. With The Idol, he replicates the first but forgets the second. It’s a creepy male gaze-athon that feels like the work of someone who went back in time and stopped the #MeToo movement from happening. Here is A Star Is Born remade as A Star Is Porn – television so icky that getting it out of your system will take a cold shower and several rounds of therapy.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlyaXNodGltZXMuY29tL2N1bHR1cmUvdHYtcmFkaW8vMjAyMy8wNi8wNS90aGUtaWRvbC1ub2JvZHktbWFrZXMtc29tZXRoaW5nLXRoaXMtZHJlYWRmdWwtYnktYWNjaWRlbnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"accident","2023-03-31","Not Discerned","{""Delhi"", ""Delhi"", ""India""}","2023-06-06T06:04:46","On 31st March this year, a 24 year muslim youth, boarded Jansampark Kranti Express at Delhi. Enroute, close to the train’s destination, at a place called Shoranur, he purchases petrol, and boards another train Alapurrha-Kannur Executive Express on 02 April. And then all of sudden, while the train is negotiating a bridge, he sprays petrol on his co-passengers, and sets them afire. Nine of them suffered serious burn injuries. A man, his wife along with her infant jumped out of the train and was later found dead near the tracks.  As per the Special Investigation Team (SIT) Shahrukh had changed his dress after the attack. This has been captured by CCTV. The SIT is also certain that local support and facilitation was extended to him.  This jihadi act was perpetrated by Shahrukh Saifi, a resident of infamous Shaheenbagh in Delhi. He was finally apprehended by the Maharashtra ATS in Ratnagiri. As per the Special Investigation Team (SIT) Shahrukh had changed his dress after the attack. This has been captured by CCTV. The SIT is also certain that local support and facilitation was extended to him.  Precisely, two months later, on 01 June a compartment was again set on fire at Kannur. Mercifully, it was an empty coach. This coach was meters away from a BPCL fuel storage facility. As per the police, this time the perpetrator was a Hindu by the name of Prusenjit Sidgar, a resident of 24 Parganas in West Bengal. The police explanation was bizarre rather an assault on any sane mind. It maintained that the accused had worked in several hotels in Mumbai and Kolkatta, but for the last two years was an itinerant beggar. Unable to receive any alms during that fateful period, he out of sheer frustration set the coach on fire. The police further said it was an impromptu act wherein the accused used matchbox for the purpose. The matchbox was in his possession to cater to his smoking habit.  Was it another attempt to balance jihadi terror by fabricating an act of sabotage by a lunatic Hindu?  Shahrukh, the police maintains, was highly radicalized. He was deeply inspired by Zakir Naik and Islamic preacher Israr Ahmed based in Pakistan. What was the inspiration for 40 year old Pushanjit Sidgar? Why was Kannur region chosen for the attack? Probably because of the most favourable jihadi eco system that prevails there. Kasargod, Kannur, Kozhikode, Mallapuram, Palakadd and Waynad are part of this eco system, with Coimbatore serving as the pivot. It is this eco system that is at the centre of ‘Love Jihad’. It is this entrenched jihadi eco system that provided jihadis for the Islamic State from India, as well as sex slaves, victims of Love Jihad. This region is at the centre of the movie ‘Kerela Story’.  Why travel all the way from Delhi and West Bengal to Kannur in Kerela to carry out jihadi attack? This signifies the pan Indian nature of Jihad in India or Ghazwa-e-Hind Just as the Popular Front of India (PFI) went right from Kerela to Shaheenbagh in Delhi to fund and spearhead the anti-India Jihadi protests, Shahrukh travelled from Shaheenbagh to Kerela to choose his Jihadi target i.e. train passengers. Train terrorism is very much a part of jihadi terrorism dictionary in India. The modus operandi that Shahrukh chose was reminiscent of the incendiary attack on the Sabarmati Express at Ghodra on 27 Feb 2002 in which 59 karsevaks were burnt alive. Godhra too had a favourable eco system for this kind of a jihadi attack.  Why travel all the way from West Bengal to Kerela for Jihadi attack? It is because West Bengal has become the Iynchpin of the jihadi eco system of eastern part of our country comprising Bangladesh, southern part of Assam, eastern part of Bihar, West Bengal, which includes the Silliguri Corridor. Infact West Bengal has outdone Bangladesh in radicalisation and jihadi activity, radiating to other parts of India. Just recently, on 22nd May, the Gujarat police apprehended four terrorists in Ahmedadabad, namely Mohd Sajid, Khalid Ansari, Azharul Islam, and Mainmul Ansari. They were all trained in Bangladesh. They had links with AI Qaeda and were tasked to carryout jihadi activities in Gujarat.  From beginning of this year there have been several attacks on Vande Bharat trains in muslim predominant regions. The pattern of stone pelting has uncanny similarity.  On 15th Jan this year, a NIA court in Bengaluru sentenced four JMB members to seven years rigorous imprisonment. A large amount of bomb making material was recovered from them. The recovery also included Rocket Launcher manufacturing material. They also were found guilty of committing dacoities at several locations in Bengaluru for generating funds for Jihad. Earlier, on 30th November three members of the JMB were also sentenced for seven years imprisonment for similar jihadi activities. They were again from West Bengal. In July 2019, the NIA busted a JMB sleeper module and recovered hand grenades and bomb making material. They were planning to carry out multiple attacks in different parts of the state. Bangladeshi jihadis are also engaged in economic Jihad in Bengaluru.  In Feb 2020, a NIA court awarded six years imprisonment to a Bangladeshi national for distributing fake Indian currency. Bengali speaking jihadis, perpetrating jihadi attacks in Mumbai, Kerela and Bengaluru is a reminder of the pan sub-continental dimension of Islam. Committing dacoities to raise funds from within India for Ghazwa e Hind, is the concept of ‘Male-Ganimat’ or war booty, enjoined by Islamic scriptures. In this regard the jihadis are inspired by the ultimate messianic example in Islam.  All the subcontinental jihadi tanzeems feed on each other. The AI Qaeda is the mother organization of most of these groups. Pakistan based jihadi tanzeems like the Lashkar e Taiba (LeT) and Jaish e Mohammad (JeM) have substantial influence amongst the fundamentalists in Bangladesh. ln the JeM attack on Pathankot airbase in Jan 2016, a JMB operative, Zia-ul-Haque also had important role. He had close links with the JeM. He is also one of the accused in Burdwan blasts. He was arrested by the NIA in 2014. JeM’s Bengal link has been well established. A JeM operative Belal Hussain alias Nandu Mondal was also arrested for his role in the Kandhar hijack . He was also known for his frantic efforts towards establishment of a JeM network in West Bengal.  From beginning of this year there have been several attacks on Vande Bharat trains in muslim predominant regions. The pattern of stone pelting has uncanny similarity. Vande Bharat trains have been attacked by the jihadis because they view any progressive development in India from the Jihadi and Pakistani prism. They wish India to be cut to the level of Pakistan. India’s progress is an anathema to them. They curse Abul Kalam Azad for his un-Islamic acts of contributing towards enhancing the strategic strength of India.  In January alone there were three attacks on Vande Bharat trains i.e. Katihar in Bihar, Phansidewa in West Bengal, Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh. In the following month there were two attacks, one in Mehboobnagar in Telangana, and the other between Krishnarajpuram and Bengaluru Cantonment in Karnatka. Again in March, a Vande Bharat train was damaged in Murshidabad in West Bengal. In April, in Andhra Pradesh, a Vishakhapatnam bound Vande Bharat was stone-pelted between Khamam and Vijayawada railway station. In May, another Vandey Bharat, travelling between Kasargod and Tiruvanthapuram in Kerela came under attack.  The endemic attacks on Vande Bharat trains have been generally in and around the Red Corridor and the Jihadi Corridor, extending from Kerela to West Bengal. We have seen the anti-national bonhomie between Maoists and Jihadis, and their political benefactors at Shaheen Bagh. Balasore also lies in the proximity same corridor.  Since Jihad in the country is a pan-Indian phenomenon, attacks on trains have pan-India impact. The attacks on Vande Bharat trains probably fell short of the intended jihadi message, a target with much bigger human component was chosen  Intelligence agencies of inimical foreign countries have been desperately vying for direct and indirect presence here, because of the place being the site of India’s missile tests. The humongous mishap or the three train crash on 02 June in Balasore wherein in the Coromandel Express lost 275 passengers should be viewed in this backdrop. Given this backdrop it is rather premature to dismiss the three train crash as accident.  The Railway Minister Mr Ashwani Vaishnav has said: “The root cause of the horrifying incident has been identified… I do not want to go in to the details. Let the report come out. I will just say that the root cause and the people responsible have been identified.” The minister has indicated that something went wrong with the electronic interlocking system based on an electronic point machine, a critical device for railway signaling and electronic interlocking. From the minister’s statement, it can be extrapolated that there has been some submission or commission by the railway staff. In the prevailing environment, jihadi subversion or Maoist subversion or both is a distinct possibility.  Since Jihad in the country is a pan-Indian phenomenon, attacks on trains have pan-India impact. The attacks on Vande Bharat trains probably fell short of the intended jihadi message, a target with much bigger human component was chosen. Thus Coromandel Express became the target.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHA6Ly93d3cuaW5kaWFuZGVmZW5jZXJldmlldy5jb20vY29yb21hbmRlbC1leHByZXNzLWFjY2lkZW50LW9yLXRlcnJvci1hdHRhY2sv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"accident","2023-11-06","14:30:00","{""Channelview"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-06-06T03:07:53","A Channelview man walks away with a few scrapes after accidentally sending a natural gas tank 900 feet away into his neighbor's home on Avenue C.  CHANNELVIEW, Texas (KTRK) -- Two homes were destroyed in one freak accident on the east side of Harris County on Monday evening.  The Harris County Fire Marshal's Office told Eyewitness News that the call came in at about 2:30 p.m. as an explosion, but as they started asking questions, they realized a man was trying to dispose of a compressed natural gas tank when he and the tank went flying.  The compressed natural gas tank now sits in one family's front yard after leaving a crater through the roof of their home and the floor of their living room.  The homeowner, Jose Ortiz, told ABC13 he thanks God that his family was outside when this big tank dropped from the sky and into their home on Avenue C.  ""Yo estoy agradecido con Dios que mi familia esta bien,"" Ortiz said.  Ortiz said his sister-in-law was relaxing on the hammock while their children played in the front yard when she heard a loud noise. When she opened the front door to the home, she saw it was destroyed. The tank, which has since been removed, caused a hole about six feet on the roof and the floor to cave in.  Nine hundred feet away on Sheldon Road, ABC13 met Antonio Medralo, who said the tank went flying from his yard, and it's something he never expected.  ""Nadie sabe que va pasar una cosas de esas,"" Medralo said.  Medralo said he was tired of seeing it lying at his home since they bought it years ago and decided to use a saw to try to splice it to throw it away. Bystanders told ABC13 they heard a loud explosion and spotted sawdust, and a man, who we now know is Medralo, in the air.  Medralo, with a cut on his forehead and a scrape on his back, was seemingly almost unharmed.  ""I could not begin to explain how it is that he has the minor injuries that he has and was able to walk away. I would certainly buy a lottery ticket if I were him,"" HCFMO Deputy Chief Mitchell Weston said.  Medralo said he feels lucky and thankful his family, and Ortiz's family are OK.  Weston said the tank was abandoned in the Medralo's yard, and Monday was the day they wanted to dispose of it, and when they cut the tank with a saw, the pressure escaped.  He says the pressure of the tank was so powerful that it looked like there was an explosion at Medralo's home too. According to Weston, the tank is made of metal and fiberglass. He recommends people not cut into these tanks.  Medralo's message to the Ortiz family is he's very sorry and that this wasn't intentional. He said it's a lesson learned.  As for the Ortiz family, they're now trying to figure out where they will sleep and how they will afford to repair damages to their family home that was no fault of their own. The Ortiz family created a GoFundMe to help raise money to fix their home.  HCFMO said the explosion is a civil matter, meaning no one will be charged with a crime.

Henry Dunn was working on a cattle station in the Northern Territory when the lower half of his left arm was crushed in a machine and had to be amputated. The accident happened on November 15.  Scroll to continue with content Ad ADVERTISEMENT  Mr Dunn’s year abroad began last January, when he flew out to Thailand before travelling through southeast Asia, then to New Zealand and finally Australia.  There, he spent three months working on a cattle station, learning to drive tractors, a forklift truck and ride a motorbike to move cattle between paddocks.  “As I approached my last week before heading on to Perth, I was involved in a serious accident,” said the Cardiff Metropolitan University graduate, recounting his ordeal on an online fundraising page.  Mr Dunn had been using a tool that drives fenceposts into the ground when his left arm was crushed, according to LBC.  He was flown 500km (310 miles) to the Royal Darwin Hospital where he underwent emergency surgery, in which the lower part of his arm was amputated.  “It wasn’t the end to my travels as anyone expected,” he wrote.  Mr Dunn has now returned to the UK. Updates posted on his Instagram page show him undergoing physiotherapy and exercising rigourously, while trying various prosthetics for his lower arm.  “My ‘residual limb’ is changing shape all of the time as it goes through different stages of healing,” he wrote in Instagram. “Doctors explained the healing like baking a pie. The outside looks ready but inside is still raw; still a long way to go.”  Henry Dunn spent three months working on a cattle farm in Australia’s Northern Territory (Henry Dunn/Instagram)  Henry has received a payout through the Northern Territory Workers’ Compensation Scheme, but has launched a fundraiser to help cover costs not covered, such as leisure activities and courses to aid his recovery. He has so far raised around £8,000.  ”What’s most important now is building a strong foundation for both my physical and mental recovery,” he wrote on the fundraiser, where his response to the accident has been praised as “inspirational”.  “I am optimistic about the future and the challenges to come.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vdWsuc3BvcnRzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL2JyaXRpc2gtdHJhdmVsbGVyLTIzLWxvc2VzLWFybS0wOTM2NDI3NjguaHRtbNIBVmh0dHBzOi8vdWsuc3BvcnRzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9hbXBodG1sL25ld3MvYnJpdGlzaC10cmF2ZWxsZXItMjMtbG9zZXMtYXJtLTA5MzY0Mjc2OC5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"accident","2021-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Pasco"", ""Washington"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-06-05T15:17:00","Boating accidents involving captains impaired by alcohol or drugs fell by nearly half in Florida, those killed while operating personal watercraft dropped by 70%, and the overall number of people injured while boating was down slightly.  That’s according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission’s new report on the 2022 boating season. The main takeaway: Fewer accidents at sea, but more deaths overall.  Florida still leads the nation in the number of registered vessels.  Boating deaths climbed slightly, perhaps because the number of fatal falls from a vessel was up as was the percentage of accidents that resulted in a drowning death.  Forest Rothchild, a spokesman for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission in Southwest Florida, said the report may survey bad things that happen on what is supposed to be a good day on the water, but it holds many clues to safe boating — such as the person driving the vessel should have plenty of experience and expertise.  “One of the biggest standouts is not giving the proper lookout, which often carries over to boater inexperience,” he said. “Most often we see people with less often than 100 hours of experience, and we see them almost get tunnel vision, which is why we try to reiterate people’s situational awareness and having a 360-degree lookout when operating a vessel.”  Captains with no formal boating experience were at the helm in 70% of accidents last year, down from 83% in 2021, despite the number of boating safety education cards being issued down by roughly 5,000 in 2022 from the previous year.  Anyone born on or after Jan. 1, 1988, must complete a boating safety class to captain a boat in Florida, although the successful completion of a boating education course that results in the card is suggested for new captains.  The Florida Keys took the top spot in the number of boating accidents previously held by the greater Miami area.  Pinellas County ranked fourth in total accidents last year in Florida with 40 incidents.  Lee County ranked fifth with 37 accidents resulting in three fatalities.  Hillsborough County ranked eighth with 22 accidents, and Sarasota County ranked ninth with 19 accidents.  Collier County ranked 12th with 18 incidents, but nobody died.  Citrus County ranked 17th with 15 accidents. Charlotte County ranked 18th with 14 accidents and two fatalities. Pasco County ranked 19th with 13 accidents.  Manatee County ranked 21st with 12 incidents.  More than 80% of those who died were not wearing a lifejacket.  “Accidents happen quickly and unexpectedly, and boaters might not have time to grab their life jacket before finding themselves in the water,” said Lt. Nicholas Korade from FWC’s boating and waterways section. “The message is clear: life jackets save lives.”  In 2021, 23% of captains were impaired, 17 people died on personal watercraft, vessels a rider sits or stands on, not within, and the number of people injured while boating in the Sunshine State was 469.  In 2022, those numbers were 13%, five, and 457.  In 2021, 1.01 million boats were registered in Florida, boating deaths totaled 60, and 33 of those were from drowning.  In 2022, those numbers were 1.03 million, 65, and 38.  The FWC is responsible for reviewing, analyzing, and compiling boating accident data for the state. Its statistical report details boating accidents and their causes.  Information from the News Service of Florida contributed to this story.

As many as 10 samples have so far been collected from the claimants, a senior official of AIIMS, Bhubaneswar said.  He said the bodies have now been shifted to the five containers where they can be preserved for longer period.  The official said there should be no hurry in disposing the bodies after DNA sampling as they can be preserved in container for six months.  Of the 278 dead persons, 177 bodies have been identified while another 101 need to be identified and handed over to their families.  AIIMS, Bhubaneswar had received 123 bodies of which around 64 have been identified.  A claimant from, Jharkhand on Tuesday alleged that they had on Monday identified body of Upendra Kumar Sharma, but it was handed over to someone other on June 6.  ""What is the point of doing DNA sampling if the body has been handed over to someone other. We had identified Upendra from the tattoo mark on his body,"" the relative said.  However, Dr Pravas Tripathy, Deputy Superintendent of AIIMS, Bhubaneswar, said that the bodies were being handed over after detail inquiry. It is a fact that more than one family have been claiming a single body and for that DNA sampling is being done.  Replying a question, he said that it may require at least 7 to 10 days to get DNA sampling report.  As the bodies were now being kept in container, there should be no problem in preserving the bodies, he said.  Most of the victims belonged to West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu besides Odisha.  Meanwhile, three agencies - CBI, Commissioner of Railway safety (CRS) and GRP, Balasore - have begun inquiry into the Balasore triple train crash in which at least 278 people were killed.  Meanwhile, Khurda Divisional Railway Manager (DRM) Rinkesh Roy suspected outside physical tampering of equipment for which the Coromandel express entered into the loop line and hit the iron laden goods train causing triple train crash on June 2.  Roy said when the Coromandel express passed through Bahanaga Bazar station, there was green signal on the main line. The signal is usually green when all the pre-conditions required for the signal to go green are perfect. If any of the pre-conditions does not meet, technically the signal can never turn green. Unless and until anyone tampers with the signal system, it remains red, Mr. Roy said.  Stating that the railways has a system called data logger where each event starting from the pushing of signal buttons gets recorded, the DRM said that the ""data logger shows that there was green signal.

Swift, 33, was introducing her band's latest member, pianist Karina DePiano, when she turned around to cover her mouth and cough. ""I just swallowed a bug. I'm so sorry,"" she told fans, according to videos from the show.  ""It's totally fine. It's just stupid,"" said Swift, before trying to spit out the bug and joking, ""Delicious.""  ""Oh, God,"" added the Grammy winner. ""Is there any chance none of you saw that?""  Swift laughed as she continued coughing and said, ""It's fine. I swallowed it.""  ""This is going to happen again tonight. There's so many bugs. There's 1,000 of them,"" she told the crowd. ""Anyway, this has been fun.""

"accident","2023-06-03","02:00:00","Not Discerned","2023-06-05T15:48:20","MONTREAL (AP) – A fishing excursion ended in tragedy on Saturday when four children died in a village in northeastern Quebec, provincial police said.  Authorities said they were still searching for a missing man in his 30s who was a member of the fishing party and remained unaccounted for.  The bodies of the four children – all minors older than 10 – were found unresponsive on the river bank a few hours after authorities received an emergency call about a group that had been swept up by the tide near Portneuf- sur-Mer, about 550 kilometers (341 miles) northeast of Montreal.  They were among a group of 11 people who were fishing for capelin on foot near the shore when they were caught off guard by the rising tide.  Quebec provincial police divers and Canadian Forces members took part in the search for the missing adult.  Mayor Jean-Maurice Tremblay said Saturday he did not know more about the victims or if they were from Portneuf-sur-Mer, a community of about 600 people.  “Everyone is affected by what happened, because this kind of event, it’s the first time it’s happened,” Tremblay said in French. “When it involves five people, and four children drowning during a recreational activity, it’s certain people are quite sad about it.”  Capelin – a silvery smelt fish – are a forage species consumed by many marine animals, and Tremblay said fishing for them is a popular activity in his part of Quebec’s north shore. It is done on the banks of the river using scoops rather than fishing lines.  Capelin most often roll at night, so people light a fire on the shore and wait, Tremblay added.  Tremblay said the sandbank on which the victims were fishing is accessed by all- terrain vehicles. They were caught on a part of the peninsula where parts can be submerged by up to four meters of water when the tide rises.  A 911 call came in at about 2 a.m. on Saturday, and police say six people were rescued from the water and five others were reported missing – the four victims and the missing man.  The bodies of the four children were transported to a nearby health clinic where a doctor confirmed their deaths.  Police investigators and forensic teams have been deployed to shed light on what happened.  Copyright 2023 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

"accident","2020-07-20","14:00:00","{""ConceptionBaySouth"", ""NewfoundlandAndLabrador"", ""Canada""}","2023-06-06T00:00:51","'There's a heartfelt desire for healing for all of those involved,' said lawyer for Hurricane Industrial Equipment Ltd.  ST. JOHN'S, N.L. — A Nova Scotia-based industrial equipment dealership has been fined $10,000 for an accident that saw a forklift mast fall on a service technician working in Conception Bay South, pinning him underneath.  The man, who suffered a partial hand amputation and a crushed chest, had not wanted to see anyone charged in relation to the incident and was grateful to the workers who had saved his life, prosecutor Amber Haighway said in provincial court in St. John’s Monday.  The Hurricane Industrial Equipment Ltd. employee was performing maintenance repairs to a 15,000-pound forklift at a Bluewater Agencies Ltd. property in Chamberlains in July 2020, when the forklift mast fell on him.  Bluewater employees heard the crash and attempted to use a small forklift to free the employee – who was choking due to the weight on his chest — to no avail. They eventually used a bigger piece of equipment to hoist the mast enough to slide the technician out from under it and gave him first aid until emergency services arrived.  A bottle jack used by the employee failed testing conducted as part of a subsequent independent examination, which revealed the jack had not been fitted with a device to prevent collapse in the event of loss of hydraulic pressure.  “On the date of the incident, the jack was not sufficient to support the equipment that (the employee) was working on. Secondary blocking was not used to support the equipment,” said defence lawyer Greg Anthony.  Hurricane Industrial’s policy requires employees to inspect a jack for physical deficiencies prior to using it and remove it from service if any are found. There was no evidence whether the technician had performed an inspection on the day in question.  Hurricane Industrial pleaded guilty to two violations of the province’s Occupational Health and Safety Act, one for failing to provide and maintain a safe workplace and necessary equipment, and another for unlawfully using a hydraulic jack for blocking an elevated part of mobile equipment, and the Crown withdrew six other charges. Bluewater Agencies had also originally been charged, but the Crown withdrew those charges last January.  Haighway and Anthony submitted a joint recommendation to Judge Jennifer Mercer for a $10,000 fine for Hurricane Industrial, which had never been charged under the OHS Act previously.  “It was not (the employee’s) desire through this process that any party be charged with regard to this incident. In a previous discussion that we had a few months ago, he also made a point of saying he was grateful for those persons who were around him at the time of the incident and indicated that without their quick response, he might not have lived,” Haighway told the court.  However, she pointed out, standards for laying and prosecuting OHS charges require companies to be held accountable for violations.  “It's every worker's right to attend their place of employment and to be free from risk, injury or death,” she said. “Without maintaining safe working standards and holding employers accountable for violations, each workplace has the potential to enable tragic results.”  Anthony told the court the incident wasn’t the result of a flagrant disregard for safety or any intentional conduct by Hurricane Industrial. He detailed the changes the company has made since the accident, including the implementation of a new jacking and blocking procedure; the monthly inspection by the company and yearly inspection by an external consultant of all jacks; weekly safety meetings with technicians, and the development of a mobile training app that provides lessons on safe workplace practices and other topics.  “The company does not compromise employee or project safety,” Anthony said, adding the employee had undergone jacking and blocking training a year prior to the accident and is a respected and valued field service technician who had “always been viewed as having good judgment and as being a very safety oriented individual.”  Hurricane supported the man during his recovery by keeping him on the payroll, paying for his physiotherapy and extra medical expenses, and accommodating his slow return to his regular duties last year, Anthony said.  “Hurricane … accepts and acknowledges its responsibility in this matter and there's a heartfelt desire for healing for all of those involved,” he told the court.  Mercer accepted the joint recommendation and gave the company 90 days to pay the fine.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zYWx0d2lyZS5jb20vYXRsYW50aWMtY2FuYWRhL25ld3MvY2FuYWRhL25vdmEtc2NvdGlhLWNvbXBhbnktZmluZWQtMTAwMDAtZm9yLXdvcmtwbGFjZS1hY2NpZGVudC10aGF0LXNhdy1mb3JrbGlmdC1tYXN0LWZhbGwtb24tZW1wbG95ZWUtMTAwODYwNzI2L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

""It's devastating to hear that she leaves behind a small child, a boyfriend, and family, loved ones.

Authorities secure the entrance to Mine Bank Trail, an access point to the rescue operation along the Blue Ridge Parkway where a Cessna Citation crashed over mountainous terrain near Montebello (AP)  The family had been returning home to East Hampton, New York, after a four-day trip to Mr Rumpel’s home in North Carolina, he told The New York Times.  “My family is gone, my daughter and granddaughter,” Barbara Rumpel, an NRA executive, wrote in a Facebook post.  Another daughter, 19-year-old Victoria, died in a diving accident in 1994, according to DailyMail.com.  After her death, Mr Rumpel and his wife bought an 11-storey building in Melbourne, Florida, and turned it into Victoria Landing, an assisted-living facility named after their late daughter.  “Victoria Landing gets its name from Victoria Rumpel. Victoria was John’s daughter who died tragically at the young age of nineteen in a scuba diving accident,” the website states.  “John honors the memory of his daughter with the Victoria Landing name. With that honor comes the responsibility to make Victoria Landing the very best it can be…in commemoration of Victoria and in celebration of everything life can and should be. Life is simply too precious.”  The plane’s lone pilot was seen slumped over in his seat before it crashed in a heavily wooded area near Waynesboro, Virginia, a source told CNN.  The flight had been travelling from east Tennessee to Long Island New York at 34,000ft when it became unresponsive and triggered an interception by military fighter jets protecting the US capital.  John Rumpel said his daughter, grandchild and her nanny were onboard the plane (AP)  When the F-16 jets reached the plane at around 3.20pm ET they fired flares to try and get the pilot’s attention, according to a statement from the Continental US North American Aerospace Defense Command Region.  “The pilot was unresponsive and the Cessna subsequently crashed near the George Washington National Forest, Virginia,” the release said. “NORAD attempted to establish contact with the pilot until the aircraft crashed.”  The jets were authorized by officials to “travel at supersonic speeds” which led to a boom across the DC area. The F-16s did not shoot down the plane, a US official told CNN.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvLnVrL25ld3Mvd29ybGQvYW1lcmljYXMvZGMtcGxhbmUtY3Jhc2gtZ29wLWRvbm9yLWIyMzUxOTc5Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Memorial Day weekend marks the unofficial beginning of summer and is one of the biggest boating holidays of the year. Partnering with other law enforcement agencies, FWC officers were proactive in getting boating safety messaging out to the public before the weekend and were on the lookout for reckless or impaired vessel operators.  Between May 27-29, FWC officers removed approximately 100 unsafe and impaired vessel operators across the state of Florida for boating under the influence and responded to over 30 boating accidents. There were zero fatalities reported during this time.  “I credit the visibility and the hard work of our officers and partner agencies educating the public, removing impaired boaters from behind the wheel and responding quickly to accidents. Nothing would make me happier than to report the number zero every year,” said Lt. Col. Brian Smith, Acting Director of the FWC Division of Law Enforcement. “Florida is considered the boating and fishing capital of the world for good reason. Operating a vessel while impaired not only puts yourself and everyone on board in danger but also everyone else around you trying to enjoy a great weekend on the water.”  FWC officers were laser-focused on boating safety enforcement over the busy holiday weekend. Statewide, officers issued more than 4,000 warnings and nearly 900 citations for boating violations. They responded to more than 40 emergency calls for assistance and search and rescue.  The FWC reminds all boaters to enjoy time with friends and family but do so safely and don’t forget to designate a sober operator before departing from the dock.  For more information about boating safety, visit MyFWC.com/Boating and select “Boater Education” then “Boating Safety.”  To report dangerous boating activity the public can submit anonymous tips by texting Tip411 (847411) with the keyword “FWC” followed by the location and any information about the violation or call 888-404-FWCC (3922). Additionally, there is an easy-to-use downloadable iPhone or Android app: “FWC Wildlife Alert.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vbXlmd2MuY29tL25ld3MvYWxsLW5ld3MvbWVtb3JpYWwtd2Vla2VuZC02MjMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

He said ultimately, the accident changed his life for the better.  “You can look at an event like this negatively or positively,” said Kennison. “I took everything learned from playing sports and turned it into ‘How quick can I get into my wheelchair?’ ‘How quick can I learn how to go to the bathroom and shower?’ ‘How quick can I learn to ski again?’ I realized that if I wasn’t going to do it, no one’s going to do this for me. I really took that as motivation. This a new life. I knew that there would be challenges, and I accepted them.”  Six years later, he executed a double back flip at the exact spot of his accident. The feature length documentary film, “Full Circle: A Story of Post Traumatic Growth,” directed by Josh Berman and produced by Denver based Level 1 Production, documents that journey.  “Full Circle” is kicking off Carbondale-based 5Point Film’s Summer Film Series with two screenings: Tuesday at the Wheeler Opera House, and Wednesday at TACAW. Kennison will be at both events, which will include a Q&A after the film.  “Full Circle,” Trevor Kennison at Corbet’s Couloir.  Level 1 Production/Courtesy photo  Courtesy Dew Tour  Kennison, originally from New Hampshire, grew up a gifted all-around athlete and fell in love with Colorado when he was 12 on a family road trip across the Western states, which he called “the best experience of his life.” That trip, and the fact that his sister was living in the Roaring Fork Valley, inspired him to move to Avon when he was 21. Less than a year later, his life would change dramatically.  He said the first year after the accident was tough. After months at Denver’s Craig Hospital, he returned to New Hampshire and stayed with a friend, who took him in and let him sleep on the couch. But with the bathroom on the second floor, it wasn’t a long-term situation.  He credits his his sister and brother-in-law, Ashley and Thomas Caruso, who lived in Snowmass, for getting him to a better place.  “They took me out for my first runs and got me involved with Challenge Aspen and other organizations, which was really cool,” he said. “But the first time was hard. After trying a few times, I finally got on a run, and I’m going down and going down and I’m just gripping the outriggers so hard, I couldn’t feel my forearms. And from there I was hooked. I was living in Aspen, and I was skiing Snowmass and Highlands with my brother-in-law snowboarding behind me every single day. That is why I became the sit skier I am today, because he gave me the confidence that I can try this and if I fall, he’s going to pick me up. For him to do that and watch me progress was just the best thing ever.”  Behind the scenes of the filming of “Full Circle.”  Level 1 Production/Courtesy photo  The film has been in the works since before the lockdowns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which Kennison called a blessing in disguise. When he initially approached Director Josh Berman about the project, the idea was to produce a three-part limited docuseries leading up to his attempt at the double back flip. But the pandemic gave the filmmakers time to flesh out a more robust story and connect Kinneson’s story with one that happened 50 years earlier.  “Full Circle” follows Trevor on his path of post-traumatic growth and concurrently the story of pioneer climber and extreme skier Barry Corbet, who became a paraplegic after a 1968 helicopter crash in Aspen.  “Full Circle,” Barry Corbet filming at Craig Hospital in Denver.  Level 1 Production/Courtesy photo  Skier dies at Steamboat Resort after falling in tree well  Though 50 years apart, their stories mirror each other with common locations and themes — injuries in the Colorado backcountry, rehab at Craig Hospital, fame in Jackson Hole. But they also share a resiliency of spirit and refusal to let their love of life to be diminished by their injuries. It’s ultimately a film about hope and not only surviving, but thriving through life’s most difficult challenges.  For Kennison who is just shy of his 31st birthday, he is grateful to be where he is today and said that not being afraid to ask for and accept help, as well as taking care of his mental health, ultimately got him through the dark days.  “I don’t care if you’re disabled or able bodied, it’s just so important to work on your mental health. This injury so physical, but at the same time with a spinal cord injury, it’s also such a mental battle,” he said.  “What do I want audiences to take away? If someone is struggling or going through anything difficult, I just want to give them some hope. I went back and got redemption. And I am just so thankful for everyone that helped me get to where I am and for what’s to come. I can’t wait for people to see this movie. It’s going to change so many lives.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdW1taXRkYWlseS5jb20vbmV3cy9jb2xvcmFkby1yaWRlci1wYXJhbHl6ZWQtaW4tMjAxNC12YWlsLXBhc3MtYWNjaWRlbnQtdHJldm9yLWtlbm5pc29uLWZpbmRzLXJlZGVtcHRpb24taW4tZnVsbC1jaXJjbGUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

It’s also important to know what NOT to do. Here are 3 common mistakes drivers make after a collision.  First, Forgetting to gather information. A name and number of the other driver are not enough. Ask to see their license. Take photos of their license plate and both vehicles. Talk to witnesses.  Second, failing to call the police. Not reporting an accident to law enforcement makes you vulnerable to an uninsured driver or simply a dishonest one. Always call the police and file an accident report.  And third, refusing medical care. Acknowledge if you feel pain, even if it’s later after the adrenaline has worn off. If necessary, schedule an appointment with a medical care provider.  If you’ve been involved in an accident, you can always call the Taylor King law firm at 1.800.CAR.WRECK.

"accident","2022-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-06-05T20:14:13","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) is concerned that aviation accident reports are published with considerable delays. This contravenes the 1944 Convention of International Aviation or the Chicago Convention and prevents lessons can be learned. During Monday’s Annual General Meeting in Istanbul, IATA called on governments to maintain the longstanding obligation to timely publish reports. IATA is concerned about delayed publication of accident reports.  “Of the 214 accidents in the last five years, only 96 final accident reports are available. This is an inexcusable violation of the Chicago Convention and a disservice to the safety of our passengers and crew. Governments and their agencies must improve,” Director General Willie Walsh said in his speech.  The Chicago Convention dictates that states that are in charge of an accident investigation must submit a preliminary report to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) within thirty days of the accident. The final report must be published as soon as possible and within twelve months of the accident. If that is not possible, interim statements should be published annually.  Nick Careen, Senior Vice President Operations, Safety, and Security said during a presentation later that same day that just 31 reports were published in less than one year of the accident. The majority (58) have taken between one and three years to be released. He also noted that interim statements often provide little more than what was presented in the preliminary report. “Five of the 96 reports do not meet ICAO’s criteria for such reports while four others are not publicly accessible for various reasons,” said Careen.  “Safety is aviation’s highest priority. Failure to publish prompt and complete accident investigation reports deprives operators, equipment manufacturers, regulators, infrastructure providers, and other concerned stakeholders of critical information that could make flying even safer,” IATA says.  Five fatal accidents in 2022  In 2022, there were 39 accidents compared to 43 for the five-year average. There were five fatal accidents that resulted in the loss of life of 158 fatalities compared to 121 fatalities in 2021. The fatality risk was 0.11. “This means that on average, a person would need to take a flight every day for 25.214 years to experience a 100 percent fatal accident. This is an improvement over the five-year fatality rate with an average of 22.116 years,” said Nick Careen.  This year marks the twentieth anniversary of the IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA), a system launched to improve global accident rates. “IOSA has improved safety, greatly and reduced redundant audits. It is used by many regulators to complement their safety programs. Last year, the IOSA airlines all-accident rate was four times better than the rate for non-IOSA airlines of 0.70 versus 2.82,” Careen said.  He added: “Since 2005, the all-accident rate for airlines on the IOSA registry is 1.40 per million sectors compared with 3.49 per million sectors for non-IOSA airlines. Similarly, the fatality rate is 0.11 compared with 0.62.” IATA continues to roll out IOSA and plans to do 25 risk-based audits this year and 100 in 2024.  Accident rates per region increased in Europe, Latin America, Northeast Asia, and Africa. Nowhere the rate was so has in Africa, where the high number of accidents with turboprops is to blame.

"accident","2023-06-02","Not Discerned","{""NewYork"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-06-05T01:17:51","By India Today News Desk: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, in the United States, hit out at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over the Odisha triple-train accident which claimed at least 275 lives since Friday evening. Addressing the Indian diaspora in New York on Sunday, the Gandhi scion said the BJP always looks back and passes the blame.  ""You ask them (BJP) anything, they will look back and pass the blame. Ask them why the train accident (in Odisha) took place, and they (BJP) will say Congress did this 50 years ago,"" he said.  Read More  ""Their immediate response is peeche dekho (look in history),"" Rahul Gandhi said. He further drew parallels between the BJP and RSS, saying their approach was retrospective and they were merely seeking to blame the past.  Rahul Gandhi also mentioned a train tragedy under the Congress government and, in the wake of the railway accident, the then railway minister had stepped down from office as a moral responsibility. Hinting at his recent demand for Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw's resignation after the horrific train accident in Odisha, Rahul Gandhi said that his party did not shy away from taking the responsibility.  ""I remember a train accident when the Congress was in power. The Congress did not get up and say 'now it is the fault of the British that the train has crashed'. The Congress minister said 'it's my responsibility and I'm resigning'. So this is the problem we have back home, we make excuses and we are not accepting the reality we are faced with,"" Gandhi said, without naming the Congress minister.  The train collision involving Shalimar-Chennai Central Coromandel Express, Bengaluru-Howrah Superfast Express and a goods train is regarded as one of the worst railway tragedies in the history of the country. The triple train collision has claimed at least 275 lives and left more than 1,100 injured.  'PM MODI DRIVING CAR LOOKING INTO REAR-VIEW MIRROR'  Continuing his tirade against the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the former Congress MP said the ""prime minister is trying to drive the Indian car and he only looks at the rear-view mirror"".  ""He (Prime Minister Narendra Modi) is trying to drive the car...the Indian car and he looks in the rear-view mirror. Then he does not understand why this car is crashing, not moving forward. And it's the same idea with the BJP, with the RSS. All of them. You listen to the ministers, you listen to the prime minister. You will never find them talking about the future. They only talk about the past,"" he said, adding that the BJP and the RSS are incapable of looking into the future.  ""They never talk about the future; they only talk about the past. And they will always blame somebody else for the past,"" he said.  Speaking about the relevance of non-resident Indians in the country's politics, the senior Congress leader said, ""The central architect of modern India was an NRI, Mahatma Gandhi was an NRI...The freedom movement of India began in South Africa...Nehru, BR Ambedkar, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, and Subhas Chandra Bose, all were NRIs and had an open mind to the outside world. They all came home with different ideas.""  ""That's what I expect from you (the Indian community),"" Gandhi said.  ""Had he been a Congress minister, he would have said it is my responsibility and I would have given the resignation. But BJP always gives excuses,"" he further said.  The now-expelled Lok Sabha MP's attack at the Centre came during his ongoing visit to the US. He made headlines recently over his remarks about the prime minister preaching God.  He had said, ""I think if you sat Modi Ji down next to God, he would start explaining to God how the universe works. And God would get confused about what I have created.”  (With PTI inputs)  WATCH | CBI probe into Odisha train crash recommended by railway board, says Ashwini Vaishnaw","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRpYXRvZGF5LmluL2FtcC9pbmRpYS9zdG9yeS9vZGlzaGEtdHJhaW4tYWNjaWRlbnQtcmFodWwtZ2FuZGhpLWluZGlhbi1kaWFzcG9yYS11bml0ZWQtc3RhdGVzLW5ldy15b3JrLWJqcC1ibGFtZS1jb25ncmVzcy0yMzg4ODEzLTIwMjMtMDYtMDXSAZkBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5kaWF0b2RheS5pbi9hbXAvaW5kaWEvc3Rvcnkvb2Rpc2hhLXRyYWluLWFjY2lkZW50LXJhaHVsLWdhbmRoaS1pbmRpYW4tZGlhc3BvcmEtdW5pdGVkLXN0YXRlcy1uZXcteW9yay1ianAtYmxhbWUtY29uZ3Jlc3MtMjM4ODgxMy0yMDIzLTA2LTA1?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Thirteen years on, Presenjit is still recorded as “missing” in the administration’s diaries and, therefore, the family is yet to get his death certificate .Paulomi’s mother Juthika had sought the certificate as the family had been given initial compensation and Prasenjit continued to be missing. The absence of death certificates means such families cannot apply for benefits. They are crucial as the railways had promised jobs for the victims ’ kin and for claims in a tribunal.“My mother tried meeting CM Mamata Banerjee, subsequent railway ministers, local MLAs, district authorities before finally moving the civil judge’s court in Jhargram. We had lost our only earning member and had to hit the streets. My mother passed away last year. Now, I will continue her mission,” Paulomi told TOI.Others, like Surendra Singh from Kolkata and Rajesh Kumar Bothra from Liluah, moved court in 2018. Both lost their wives and children in the accident . In a 2022 hearing, the railways questioned the need for the suits. The state is yet to appear.According to Tirthankar Bhakat, the lawyer of four Jnaneswari victims’ families, all his clients had their blood tests conducted twice to thrice for DNA matches. “Yet, of the original 37 bodies unrecognised, 24 continue in the same category. All the state needs to do is call for reports from their local police stations and the place where they were seen last. A notice in a newspaper completes the process. Yet, even as we stare at another deadly railway accident, none of the ministers or bureaucrats step up for these victims,” said Bhakat.An SER spokesperson said the death certificates will be issued by the state, not the railways. The Bengal home department could not be contacted for comment.

Former corporator Sandeep Sutar rushed to the hospital upon getting the news. He slammed the civic body and said that NMMC took three years to renovate the park and just after three days there was an accident.  “Shockingly, the incident occurred despite claims by the civic body that the park had been modernised, that the maintenance, as well as testings, were done and that it was safe,” he added. “It could have been worse.”","https://news.google.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?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

But, the Sunday on June 4 was not a usual weekend as the special train from Odisha to Chennai carrying injured passengers from the derailed Coromandel Express arrived. The ambulance sound, the rushing up of wheelchairs to transport injured passengers, the clumsy voices of support staff, crying sounds of relatives who saw their loved ones after tragic hours, all these scenes have changed the place hectic and frenetic.  “Still, I have not come out of the shock which I went through. The accident happened in a fraction of second, I can’t explain the gory scenes I have witnessed, everywhere I saw was nothing but blood and mutilated bodies. The screams and voices of the people are still echoing in my ear. It would take some days for me to become normal,” M Rajesh, a passenger from the train said while sharing his horrible experience.  Rajesh was one of the 137 passengers the Tamil Nadu government has safely transported to Chennai. They were traveling in the ill-fated Coromandel Express on June 2.  Rajesh is a truck driver from Royapuram, Chennai. He and his team of six other drivers went to Bangladesh border on June 2 to deliver some goods in the truck. They booked tickets the same day on the Coromandel Express to reach Chennai. Unfortunately, the train derailed and ended up in one of the worst tragic accidents.  “The accident left me in mental trauma. Don’t know that I prefer trains to travel in my life hereafter. I was even scared to board this special train. Whenever I hear some noise it gives me shivers,” added Rajesh.  “It is a man-made disaster and that could have been avoided,” fumed another passenger Samsudheen from Payyanur Kerala. He was returning in Coromandel Express with his family after meeting his son in Kolkata.  He added, “I have crossed 45 years, but I have never seen a harrowing accident like this in my lifetime.” The Kerala government has arranged a special service to take care of him and his family to reach back.  State Health and Family Welfare Minister Ma Subramanian and Revenue and Disaster Management Minister KKSSR Ramachandran received the injured passengers with their teams.  As many as 290 passengers, who met with the tragic accident boarded the train and other than 137 had disembarked at various stations on the way. The train departed from Bhadrak railway station Odisha on June 3 and reached Chennai central railway station at 4:45 am, on Sunday.  A medical team with 36 doctors and 30 medical staff examined and provided first aid to the passengers. Some passengers with major injuries were transported to Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital through ambulances. Nearly, 20 ambulances were stationed at Central railway station which was used to transport the passengers with major injuries to the hospitals.  More than 207 ICU beds have been set up in 6 government hospitals, including RGGGH, Omandurar multi-specialty hospital, and Stanley government Hospital to provide utmost care and treatment to the passengers, said Subramanian. A special medical team was stationed in Chennai international airport to treat the passengers who reach the city by flight, he added.  The Revenue Department has arranged transport facility for the passengers to reach their homes.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR0bmV4dC5pbi9uZXdzL3RhbWlsbmFkdS9nb3J5LWFjY2lkZW50LXN1cnZpdm9ycy1zdGlsbC1pbi1zaG9jay1yZWNvdW50LWhvcnJvci1vbi1yZWFjaGluZy1jaGVubmFpLTcxNjY5N9IBeWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR0bmV4dC5pbi9hbXAvbmV3cy90YW1pbG5hZHUvZ29yeS1hY2NpZGVudC1zdXJ2aXZvcnMtc3RpbGwtaW4tc2hvY2stcmVjb3VudC1ob3Jyb3Itb24tcmVhY2hpbmctY2hlbm5haS03MTY2OTc?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The first was a scary garage fire after an accident involving one of his cars. He suffered second and maybe third-degree burns, however, as he recovered the former Tonight Show host kept his wits about him. Then, a couple of months after that, Leno broke multiple bones in a motorcycle accident . While some may suspect that he’d slow down and maybe retire after all of this, it’s actually the opposite as the comedian opened up the future of his career.  Despite the fact that Jay Leno was involved in two dangerous accidents in two months, he has every intention to keep working. When it comes to retirement, he explained to Page Six that there’s only one way he’ll stop working, saying:  [I won’t stop working] unless I have a stroke. Then you slow down. That’s when you retire — when you have your stroke.  Based on how he’s bounced back from these two major incidents, it’s clear that the former Tonight Show host has no intention of slowing down. As the publication reported in November, after Leno was hospitalized for ten days with third-degree burns after the garage fire, a week after he was discharged, he was back on stage doing stand-up. So, his drive to keep doing what he loves is clear.  Then, in January, Jay Leno fell off his motorcycle, and he broke his collarbone, two ribs and had two cracked kneecaps. Literally, just a few days later he was back to work with his cars and his jokes.  The comedian continued to talk about his recovery, saying he’s doing really well, and doesn’t need to go to physical therapy anymore. After noting that he’s “doing good,” and saying that he was “fine” on multiple occasions, he spoke about how lucky he feels saying:  Look, when you’re in my position, when you’re any kind of celebrity, you’re luckier than most people.  He continued to say that “bad things happen to people every day,” and that they might not have the financial stability he was. The former Jay Leno's Garage host said that he's fortunate to be in the position he is. With his cheeky sense of humor, Leno explained that “as long as you look OK, you’re OK in Hollywood,” but based on these updates it really sounds like he’s doing well.  Despite the accidents, Jay Leno is still enjoying working on his massive car collection and taking his vehicles out for rides. He also noted that his wife has been supportive of his hobby.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpbmVtYWJsZW5kLmNvbS90ZWxldmlzaW9uL3dpbGwtamF5LWxlbm8tcmV0aXJlLWFmdGVyLXJlY2VudC1hY2NpZGVudHMtaG9zcGl0YWxpemF0aW9ucy13aGF0LWhlLXRoaW5rc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

In May alone, Waco PD has reported two crashes involving a child being knocked outside the vehicle.  The reported crash on May 18 left the child dead.  “Car seat safety and seatbelt safety alone can really save your life if you ever are in a car crash, said Waco PD PIO Cierra Shipley. “That is why we always say it’s so important to make sure that you secure that car seat properly.”  Shipley says its important to have a car seat which properly fits a child’s size.  “As they grow, they grow into a booster seat or a seat belt, but just make sure that you’re following those rules properly and to make sure you secure the car seat properly,” said Shipley.  Allison O’Cnnor with the City of Temple says rear facing child seats are the safest to install for children until they’re at least two years old.  O’Connor says there’s different ways to hook it up.  “Please make sure you’re installing the seat, using a seat belt or a latch system but not both,” said O’Connor.  O’Connor says a good way to test the car seat is to move it around.  If there’s too much movement in the seat, it can possibly injure your child.  “There can be too much movement in the case of an accident which could cause additional injuries to the child’s neck and spine,” said O’Connor.  O’Connor says its best to have no more than one inch of seatbelt slack on the car seat.  If you ever have any questions on if you properly installed your car seat, you can call Waco PD or the Temple Fire Department and they’ll come check it out and fix it if there’s any problems.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vY3czOS5jb20vbmV3cy90ZXhhcy93YWNvLXBvbGljZS1lbmNvdXJhZ2VzLWNhci1zZWF0LXNhZmV0eS1hZnRlci12ZWhpY2xlLWFjY2lkZW50LWxlYXZlcy1jaGlsZC1kZWFkL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"accident","2023-07-05","Not Discerned","{""IslamoradaVillageOfIslands"", ""Florida"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-06-04T16:08:00","Boating accidents involving captains impaired by alcohol or drugs fell by nearly half in Florida, those killed while operating personal watercraft dropped by 70 percent, and the overall number of people injured while boating was down slightly.  That’s according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission’s new report on the 2022 boating season. The main takeaway: Fewer accidents at sea, but more deaths overall.  Florida still leads the nation in the number of registered vessels.  Boating deaths climbed slightly, perhaps because the number of fatal falls from a vessel was up as was the percentage of accidents that resulted in a drowning death.  Forest Rothchild, a spokesman for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission in Southwest Florida, said the report may survey bad things that happen on what is supposed to be a good day on the water, but it holds many clues to safe boating –- such as the person driving the vessel should have plenty of experience and expertise.  “One of the biggest standouts is not giving the proper lookout, which often carries over to boater inexperience,” he said. “Most often we see people with less often than 100 hours of experience, and we see them almost get tunnel vision, which is why we try to reiterate people’s situational awareness and having a 360-degree lookout when operating a vessel,”  Captains with no formal boating experience were at the helm in 70 percent of accidents last year, down from 83 percent in 2021, despite the number of boating safety education cards being issued down by roughly 5,000 in 2022 from the previous year.  Anyone born on or after Jan. 1, 1988, must complete a boating safety class to captain a boat in Florida, although the successful completion of a boating education course that results in the card is suggested for new captains.  The Florida Keys took the top spot in the number of boating accidents previously held by the greater Miami area.  Lee County ranked fifth in total accidents last year in Florida with 37 resulting in three fatalities.  Collier County ranked 13th with 18 incidents, but nobody died. Charlotte County ranked 18th with 14 accidents and two fatalities.  More than 80 percent of those who died were not wearing a lifejacket.  “Accidents happen quickly and unexpectedly, and boaters might not have time to grab their life jacket before finding themselves in the water,” said Lt. Nicholas Korade from FWC’s boating and waterways section. “The message is clear: life jackets save lives.”  In 2021, 23 percent of captains were impaired, 17 people died on personal watercraft, vessels a rider sits or stands on, not within, and the number of people injured while boating in the Sunshine State was 469.  In 2022, those numbers were 13 percent, five, and 457.  In 2021, 1.01 million boats were registered in Florida, boating deaths totaled 60, and 33 of those were from drowning.  In 2022, those numbers were 1.03 million, 65, and 38.  The FWC is responsible for reviewing, analyzing, and compiling boating accident data for the state. Its statistical report details boating accidents and their causes.

"accident","2005-02-25","Not Discerned","{""Springfield"", ""Missouri"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-06-04T09:06:27","TRUMBULL — Nearly two decades after a hockey accident led to a torn neck artery and subsequent stroke, a town resident is a leading volunteer helping others to overcome their own brain injuries.  Last month, Garrett Mendez, 36, received the Hamden Regional Chamber of Commerce's ""Healthcare Warrior Award"" for his volunteer work at the Gaylord Specialty Healthcare hospital in Wallingford.  Mendez suffered the brain-stem stroke in 2005, days after colliding head-first with the boards while playing in a junior hockey game in Springfield, Mass. He was 19 and preparing to play for Western New England University at the time of the incident, which tore an artery in the back of his neck. After experiencing weakness in his legs and suffering from a headache, he was found unresponsive by his mother and rushed to an emergency room.  Doctors at the time said the tear, which slowly bled and clotted, caused the stroke.  Mendez was admitted to Gaylord Hospital for intensive inpatient rehabilitation, which helped him restore some of the movement he lost from the accident. Today, Mendez says, he has lost some fine motor skills, but makes up for it with gross motor skills involving the larger muscles in his body.  His speech also became clear in the recovery after undergoing exercises and learning to coordinate his breathing.  ""When I first suffered my stroke, I couldn't say a word. I had to relearn how to talk,"" Mendez said.  Mendez said he was inspired to volunteer for the hospital by his parents. While he was still recovering, they helped other patients get to and from their rooms and volunteered at events.  ""As I got better, I began to go with them to events to help out there,"" Mendez said. ""That's where I felt I need to give back as much as I can.""  Mendez is now one of the most active volunteers at Gaylord, where he mentors those who have acquired brain injuries. His work is part of a peer mentorship program that connects patients and their families with trained volunteers who had received treatment for similar injuries.  Mendez has volunteered at the hospital in weekly visits since 2018. He said his work as a mentor often involves advocating for a patient's needs such as suggesting types of therapy. For example, he said he might suggest that staff consider pool therapy for patients who were swimmers or enjoyed swimming before their injury — or if it's simply hot outside.  ""Some of them have good days, some of them have bad days, which happens. Just really overall anxiety and frustration,"" Mendez said of patients he's worked with. ""I want them to be able to kind of vent on me to tell me what's going on.""  A recent graduate of Sacred Heart University, Mendez also works part-time for a physical therapy office in Westport. He's previously worked at similar offices about 10 years.

A screenshot of the GoFundMe campaign (click the photo to go to the page) supporting the family of Mahesh Boya, the Eden Prairie man who died in a rollover crash in Wisconsin last month.  Boya, a student at Concordia University and a member of the Indian Student Association, was one of four friends from Eden Prairie traveling in a 2006 Toyota Camry when the crash occurred at about 9 a.m. May 23, about 35 miles south of Duluth on Highway 35 near Solon Springs, Wisconsin.  According to the Wisconsin State Patrol, the driver, Pallapolu Reddy, 23, swerved to avoid an object on the road, causing the vehicle to lose control and overturn.  Boya, a backseat passenger, was ejected during the crash and pronounced dead at the scene. He was not wearing a seat belt.  Advertisement  The driver and another passenger, 21-year-old Bharath Reddy, were treated for non-life-threatening injuries at Essentia Health in Duluth, while another passenger, 22-year-old Thumu S. Reddy, was not injured. All three were wearing seatbelts at the time of the crash.  The state patrol reported that alcohol was not a factor in the crash, which remains under investigation.  A day after the accident, Dheeraj Kolla of the school’s Indian Student Association launched a GoFundMe campaign to support Boya’s family financially. The campaign aims to assist with funeral expenses, medical bills, and other unanticipated costs.  The campaign has raised about $66,000 of its $100,000 goal as of Sunday afternoon.  On the GoFundMe page, Boya is described as a bright and ambitious student who hailed from a small village in the Mahabubnagar district of the Indian state of Telangana.  He faced numerous challenges in pursuing a better future, coming from a financially disadvantaged background, the page stated. His father worked as a contract worker in Maharashtra, while his mother dedicated herself to being a homemaker.  “We cannot fathom the pain and loss that Mahesh’s family is enduring at this moment,” the GoFundMe page stated. “As a close-knit community, let us rally together and provide support to help alleviate the financial burden they now face. Funeral expenses, medical bills, and the various costs associated with such an unexpected tragedy can be overwhelming.”  Any funds raised beyond the immediate needs will be used to establish a memorial scholarship in his name, “ensuring that his legacy lives on and inspires other students from underprivileged backgrounds to pursue their dreams,” the page stated.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVwbG9jYWxuZXdzLm9yZy8yMDIzLzA2LzA0L2dvZnVuZG1lLWNhbXBhaWduLWxhdW5jaGVkLWZvci1lcC1tYW4ta2lsbGVkLWluLXdpc2NvbnNpbi1yb2xsb3Zlci1hY2NpZGVudC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"accident","2023-06-04","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-06-04T13:01:11","The derailment in eastern India that killed 275 people and injured hundreds was caused by an error in the electronic signaling system that led a train to wrongly change tracks and crash into a freight train, officials said Sunday.  Authorities worked to clear the mangled wreckage of the two passenger trains that derailed Friday night in Balasore district in Odisha state in one of the country’s deadliest rail disasters in decades.  An Odisha government statement revised the death toll to 275 after a top state officer put the number at over 300 on Sunday morning. The officer spoke on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to speak to reporters.  Jaya Verma Sinha, a senior railway official, said the preliminary investigations revealed that a signal was given to the high-speed Coromandel Express to run on the main track line, but the signal later changed, and the train instead entered an adjacent loop line where it rammed into a freight loaded with iron ore.  Rescue workers gather around damaged carriages during search for survivors at the accident site of a three-train collision near Balasore, about 200 km (125 miles) from the state capital Bhubaneswar in the eastern state of Odisha, on June 3, 2023. (Ph Expand  The collision flipped Coromandel Express’s coaches onto another track, causing the incoming Yesvantpur-Howrah Express from the opposite side also to derail, she said.  The passenger trains, carrying 2,296 people, were not overspeeding, she said. Trains that carry goods are often parked on an adjacent loop line so the main line is clear for a passing train.  Verma said the root cause of the crash was related to an error in the electronic signaling system. She said a detailed investigation will reveal whether the error was human or technical.  The electronic interlocking system is a safety mechanism designed to prevent conflicting movements between trains. It also monitors the status of signals that tell drivers how close they are to a next train, how fast they can go and the presence of stationary trains on the track.  ""The system is 99.9% error free. But 0.1% chances are always there for an error,"" Verma said. To a question whether the crash could be a case of sabotage, she said ""nothing is ruled out.""  An aerial view of Force Rescue continues work at the site of a train accident at Odisha, Balasore, India, 03 June 2023. (Photo by Stringer/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)  On Sunday, a few shattered carriages, mangled and overturned, were the only remnants of the tragedy. Railway workers toiled under the sun’s glare to lay down blocks of cement to fix the broken tracks. A crew with excavators was removing mud and the debris to clear the crash site.  At one of the hospitals nearly 15 kilometers (9 miles) from the site, survivors spoke of the horror of the moment of the crash.  Pantry worker Inder Mahato could not remember the exact sequence of events, but said he heard a loud bang when the Coromandel Express crashed into the freight. The impact caused Mahato, who was in the bathroom, to briefly lose consciousness.  Moments later when he opened his eyes, he saw through the door that was forced open people writhing in pain, many of them already dead. Others were frantically trying to get out from the twisted wreckage of his rail car.  For hours, Mahato, 37, remained stuck in the train’s bathroom, before rescuers scaled up the wreckage and pulled him out.  ""God saved me,"" he said, lying on the hospital bed while recuperating from a hairline fracture in his sternum. ""I am very lucky I am alive.""  Mahato’s friends weren’t so lucky. Four of them died in the crash, he said.  Officials display pictures of victims for family members to identify bodies at a business park used as temporary mortuary for the dead recovered from the carriage wreckage of a three-train collision near Balasore, in India's eastern state of Odisha, Expand  Meanwhile, many desperate relatives were struggling to identify the bodies of their loved ones because of the gruesomeness of the injuries. Few others were searching hospitals to check whether their relatives were alive.  In the same hospital where Mahato was recovering from his injuries, Bulti Khatun roamed outside the premises in a dazed state, holding an identity card of her husband who was onboard the Coromandel Express and traveling to southern Chennai city.  Khatun said she visited the morgue and other hospitals to look for him, but was unable to find him.  ""I am so helpless,"" she said, sobbing.  Fifteen bodies were recovered on Saturday evening and efforts continued overnight with heavy cranes being used to remove an engine that settled on top of a rail car. No bodies were found in the engine and the work was completed on Sunday morning, said Sudhanshu Sarangi, director-general of fire and emergency services in Odisha.  The crash occurred at a time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi is focusing on the modernization of the British colonial-era railroad network in India, which has become the world’s most populous country with 1.42 billion people. Despite government efforts to improve safety, several hundred accidents occur every year on India’s railways, the largest train network under one management in the world.  Modi visited the crash site on Saturday and talked to rescue officials. He also visited a hospital to inquire about the injured, and spoke to some of them.  Modi told reporters he felt the pain of the crash victims. He said the government would do its utmost to help them and strictly punish anyone found responsible.  In 1995, two trains collided near New Delhi, killing 358 people in one of the worst rail accidents in India. In 2016, a passenger train slid off the tracks between the cities of Indore and Patna, killing 146 people.  Most such accidents in India are blamed on human error or outdated signaling equipment.

Police said they were called that day just after 11 p.m. about reports of shots fired into an occupied home. Moments later, they said, they received a report of someone evading a motor vehicle accident at the intersection of Broad Street and Westfield Road.  ""The vehicle was left behind in the intersection and the occupants fled the scene,"" they said. ""The investigation would reveal the two incidents were linked.""  Police said a single round was fired into the home on Park Avenue, adding the bullet went through the two front doors into the living area, then traveled into a bedroom and became lodged in the wall. They said three residents were at home when the bullet was fired into the apartment, but no one was reported struck.

A support motorcycle, with a driver and cameraman, collided with one of the athletes on a bicycle. The driver of the motorcycle, a 70-year-old man, died on the scene. The 50-year-old cameraman and 26-year-old athlete survived and were both taken to the hospital, the athlete having suffered serious injuries.  The accident occurred in the second leg of the race on bicycles and was captured on live television. The race continued, but the live broadcast did not, out of respect for those involved in the accident and their loved ones. The police cordoned off the part of the road where the accident occurred and eventually set up a diversion. However, only the nine competitors who were in the lead were able to continue the race without complications, as several others had to stop and walk their bikes while emergency services attended to the victims. The German Red Cross team offered counseling to witnesses of the accident.  What caused the collision at the Ironman European championships triathlon?  Police spokesman Curt Wenzel said that the cause of the collision is still unknown, but noted that though the area of the collision was narrow, it should not have been particularly dangerous compared to other places along the route. Some other athletes, however, criticized the quantity of motorcycles as well as the narrow roads.  “It was incredibly narrow, a complete farce. I was right next to it and saw the bike shatter into what felt like a thousand pieces,” said fourth place finisher Jan Frodeno. “I know that such things must always be covered by the media, but athletes’ safety should come first.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vZW4uYXMuY29tL290aGVyX3Nwb3J0cy9kZWFkbHktYWNjaWRlbnQtaW4taGFtYnVyZy1nZXJtYW55LXR2LW1vdG9yY3ljbGUtY29sbGlkZXMtd2l0aC1hdGhsZXRlLWluLXRyaWF0aGxvbi12L9IBhAFodHRwczovL2VuLmFzLmNvbS9vdGhlcl9zcG9ydHMvZGVhZGx5LWFjY2lkZW50LWluLWhhbWJ1cmctZ2VybWFueS10di1tb3RvcmN5Y2xlLWNvbGxpZGVzLXdpdGgtYXRobGV0ZS1pbi10cmlhdGhsb24tdi8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"accident","2023-06-03","02:00:00","Not Discerned","2023-06-04T07:48:42","A fishing excursion ended in tragedy on Saturday when four children died in a village in northeastern Quebec, provincial police said.  Authorities said they were still searching for a missing man in his 30s who was a member of the fishing party and remained unaccounted for.  The bodies of the four children — all minors older than 10 — were found unresponsive on the river bank a few hours after authorities received an emergency call about a group that had been swept up by the tide near Portneuf-sur-Mer, about 550 kilometers (341 miles) northeast of Montreal.  They were among a group of 11 people who were fishing for capelin on foot near the shore when they were caught off guard by the rising tide.  Quebec provincial police divers and Canadian Forces members took part in the search for the missing adult.  Mayor Jean-Maurice Tremblay said Saturday he did not know more about the victims or if they were from Portneuf-sur-Mer, a community of about 600 people.  “Everyone is affected by what happened, because this kind of event, it’s the first time it’s happened,” Tremblay said in French. “When it involves five people, and four children drowning during a recreational activity, it’s certain people are quite sad about it.”  Capelin — a silvery smelt fish — are a forage species consumed by many marine animals, and Tremblay said fishing for them is a popular activity in his part of Quebec’s north shore. It is done on the banks of the river using scoops rather than fishing lines.  Capelin most often roll at night, so people light a fire on the shore and wait, Tremblay added.  Tremblay said the sandbank on which the victims were fishing is accessed by all-terrain vehicles. They were caught on a part of the peninsula where parts can be submerged by up to four meters of water when the tide rises.  A 911 call came in at about 2 a.m. on Saturday, and police say six people were rescued from the water and five others were reported missing — the four victims and the missing man.  The bodies of the four children were transported to a nearby health clinic where a doctor confirmed their deaths.  Police investigators and forensic teams have been deployed to shed light on what happened.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY25ld3MuY29tL25ld3Mvd29ybGQvY2hpbGRyZW4tZHJvd24tZmlzaGluZy1hY2NpZGVudC1jYW5hZGEtcXVlYmVjLXJjbmE4NzYxMdIBKmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvYW1wL3JjbmE4NzYxMQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

It seems two passenger trains were derailed when one hit a cargo train. It's one of the worst train crashes in Indian history and the worst in several decades. Sandeep Sahu went to a nearby hospital yesterday and can tell us more. Good morning, Sandeep.  SANDEEP SAHU, BYLINE: Good morning.  RASCOE: So what do we know about what happened on Friday?  SAHU: One of the passenger trains, which was coming from the eastern Indian city of Shalimar and traveling to Chennai - that hit a stationary goods train at the Bahanaga station in eastern Indian state of Odisha. And once the collision took place, 12 carriages of the train got derailed and landed on an adjacent track where there was another train coming from the opposite direction. And the three carriages of the second train were also derailed in the collision. One of the carriages landed on top of the carriage of another train. So there were three trains involved, and it was a horrible, horrible accident that has left at least 275 people dead.  RASCOE: And you spoke to people in a hospital there about what they saw. Can you tell us about that?  SAHU: I met this woman who was with her family and she had boarded the train just 15 minutes before the crash. She was traveling with her husband and two sons, and they all were critically injured in the mishap. She and her youngest son were admitted in this Balasore hospital, and her husband and eldest son were shifted to a medical facility in Cuttack City, which has better medical facilities. And she was very distraught, unable to know anything about the condition of her husband and son. So she was very worried. She was very critically injured, but she was more worried about the fate of her husband and her youngest son.  This morning, there were five bodies extricated from the mangled remains of the train that met with an accident. And they were lined up in a school building nearby. While I was having a look at the bodies, the mobile phone inside the pocket of one of the victims started ringing. It was obviously someone close to that person who was desperately calling without quite knowing that this person is already dead. So that was a very touching scene.  RASCOE: Oh, wow. But there was some good news from that. Like, were there any ones who were rescued alive?  SAHU: Yes, yes, yes. It was a miracle of sorts. Even the railway officials and others engaged in the rescue operation - they had all assumed that there will be nobody alive in the accident site. But they were surprised to find one person who had got stuck in the mangled remains. He was rescued this morning alive, and he was immediately rushed to the hospital. That was a surprise because it has now been more than 36 hours after the accident.  RASCOE: Have officials said who is to blame or how this horrific accident happened?  SAHU: A top railway official said today that the preliminary findings of the ongoing inquiry suggest that it was a signaling error which led to the accident. But he was not willing to give any more details, and he was not very forthcoming about who will responsible. But the prime minister of India, Mr. Narendra Modi, who was here yesterday - he has said that strict action will be taken against anyone found responsible for this accident.  RASCOE: That's Sandeep Sahu in Balasore, thank you so much for joining us.  SAHU: Thank you.

"accident","2023-06-03","02:00:00","{""Baleshwar"", ""Orissa"", ""India""}","2023-06-04T23:02:00","An electronic signaling system error led to the train derailment in India that killed nearly 300 people and injured hundreds more, officials said Sunday. The error caused a train to wrongly change tracks and crash into a freight train in India's eastern state of Odisha, creating a disastrous pileup that involved a second passenger train as well.  Authorities worked to clear the mangled wreckage of the two passenger trains that derailed Friday night in Balasore district in Odisha in one of the country's deadliest rail accidents in decades.  An Odisha government statement revised the death toll to 275 on Sunday. More than 850 others were injured as of Saturday night, according to officials. Earlier Saturday, the Indian army assisted police and the National Disaster Response Force, as well as other rescue teams, to search for survivors.  ""We are not very hopeful of rescuing anyone alive,"" Sudhanshu Sarangi, Odisha's fire services chief told reporters on Saturday morning. Footage from the site of the accident showed bodies lined up along the train tracks while authorities transported injured survivors to hospitals. Odisha's Chief Secretary Pradeep Jena said at the time that more than 200 ambulances were in service.  Rescuers carry the body of a victim at the site of passenger trains that derailed in Balasore district, in the eastern Indian state of Orissa, June 3, 2023. AP Photo/Rafiq Maqbool  Jaya Verma Sinha, a senior railway official, said the preliminary investigations revealed that a signal was given to the high-speed Coromandel Express to run on the main track line, but the signal later changed, and the train instead entered an adjacent loop line where it rammed into a freight loaded with iron ore.  The collision flipped the Coromandel Express coaches onto another track, causing the incoming Yesvantpur-Howrah Express from the opposite side also to derail, she said.  The passenger trains, carrying 2,296 people, were not overspeeding, she said. Trains that carry goods are often parked on an adjacent loop line so the main line is clear for a passing train.  Verma said the root cause of the crash was related to an error in the electronic signaling system. She said a detailed investigation will reveal whether the error was human or technical.  People watch at the site where trains that derailed, in Balasore district, in the eastern Indian state of Orissa, June 4, 2023. AP Photo/Rafiq Maqbool  The electronic interlocking system is a safety mechanism designed to prevent conflicting movements between trains. It also monitors the status of signals that tell drivers how close they are to a next train, how fast they can go and the presence of stationary trains on the track.  ""The system is 99.9% error free. But 0.1% chances are always there for an error,"" Verma said. To a question whether the crash could be a case of sabotage, she said ""nothing is ruled out.""  On Sunday, a few shattered carriages, mangled and overturned, were the only remnants of the tragedy. Railway workers toiled under the sun's glare to lay down blocks of cement to fix the broken tracks. A crew with excavators was removing mud and the debris to clear the crash site.  At one of the hospitals nearly 9 miles from the site, survivors spoke of the horror of the moment of the crash.  Pantry worker Inder Mahato could not remember the exact sequence of events, but said he heard a loud bang when the Coromandel Express crashed into the freight. The impact caused Mahato, who was in the bathroom, to briefly lose consciousness.  Moments later when he opened his eyes, he saw through the door that was forced open people writhing in pain, many of them already dead. Others were frantically trying to get out from the twisted wreckage of his rail car.  For hours, Mahato, 37, remained stuck in the train's bathroom, before rescuers scaled up the wreckage and pulled him out.  ""God saved me,"" he said, lying on the hospital bed while recuperating from a hairline fracture in his sternum. ""I am very lucky I am alive.""  Mahato's friends weren't so lucky. Four of them died in the crash, he said.  People look at the photographs of the passengers who were traveling in the trains that got derailed for identification in Balasore district, in the eastern Indian state of Orissa, June 4, 2023. AP Photo/Rafiq Maqbool  Meanwhile, many desperate relatives were struggling to identify the bodies of their loved ones because of the gruesomeness of the injuries. Few others were searching hospitals to check whether their relatives were alive.  In the same hospital where Mahato was recovering from his injuries, Bulti Khatun roamed outside the premises in a dazed state, holding an identity card of her husband who was onboard the Coromandel Express and traveling to southern Chennai city.  Khatun said she visited the morgue and other hospitals to look for him, but was unable to find him.  ""I am so helpless,"" she said, sobbing.  Fifteen bodies were recovered on Saturday evening and efforts continued overnight with heavy cranes being used to remove an engine that settled on top of a rail car. No bodies were found in the engine and the work was completed on Sunday morning, said Sudhanshu Sarangi, director-general of fire and emergency services in Odisha.  The crash occurred at a time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi is focusing on the modernization of the British colonial-era railroad network in India, which has become the world's most populous country with 1.42 billion people. Despite government efforts to improve safety, several hundred accidents occur every year on India's railways, the largest train network under one management in the world.  Modi visited the crash site on Saturday and talked to rescue officials. He also visited a hospital to inquire about the injured, and spoke to some of them.  Modi told reporters he felt the pain of the crash victims. He said the government would do its utmost to help them and strictly punish anyone found responsible.  In 1995, two trains collided near New Delhi, killing 358 people in one of the worst rail accidents in India. In 2016, a passenger train slid off the tracks between the cities of Indore and Patna, killing 146 people.  Most such accidents in India are blamed on human error or outdated signaling equipment.  About 22 million people ride 14,000 trains across India every day, traveling on 40,000 miles of track.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvaW5kaWEtdHJhaW4tYWNjaWRlbnQtZXJyb3Itc2lnbmFsaW5nLXN5c3RlbS1jYXVzZS1yYWlsd2F5LW9mZmljaWFsL9IBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL2luZGlhLXRyYWluLWFjY2lkZW50LWVycm9yLXNpZ25hbGluZy1zeXN0ZW0tY2F1c2UtcmFpbHdheS1vZmZpY2lhbC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Dominic Rene Vasquez, 28, was running into oncoming traffic when he approached a Jeep at a stoplight about 5 p.m. May 25 at the intersection of Vance Jackson and Jackson Keller roads, according to San Antonio police.  Dominic approached the SUV’s rear passenger-side door and tried to enter, the police report states. The driver, who did not know him, drove forward to get away, but Dominic continued to hold onto the door handle, fell, and was run over by the vehicle’s right rear tire, investigators said. The driver pulled into a nearby parking lot to wait for first responders, and no criminal charges are expected, police said.  ALSO READ: Pedestrian killed in hit-and-run on Interstate 35 downtown  Dominic was taken with life-threatening injuries to University Hospital, where he died May 30.  Moments before the accident, Dominic told his mother he had requested an Uber driver to take him home, prompting his family to speculate that he mistook the Jeep for his ride, his brother Daniel Vasquez said in an interview. Dominic had been at Sugar’s moments before the accident.  Courtesy of Daniel Vasquez  While the circumstances of Dominic’s fatal incident are still coming into focus, the memories others have of him are vivid and inspiring as numerous people have shared images of a joyful man, describing him as a dear friend who helped many through difficult times.  As an artist, Dominic was known for painting murals of people’s loved ones who died. Daniel Vasquez said his brother didn’t paint for money, but rather as a way to heal and comfort others. He often worked with acrylic and oil-based paints, making portraits of Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X and Nipsey Hussle.  He was born and raised in San Antonio, the fourth of 13 brothers and sisters. He also left behind a 6-year-old daughter.  “He just wanted to be a dad,” his older brother said, saying it was all he would talk about.  ALSO READ: Pedestrian killed by pickup on West Side street; driver accused of fleeing scene arrested  His family has started a GoFundMe fundraising campaign to “give Dom the burial fit for a king — as he deserves.”  Dominic had honed his skills as a barber since he was a child, when he and his brothers would cut each other’s hair. As he grew older, he began cutting his friends’ hair as well.  “Everyone wanted a cut,” Daniel Vasquez said. “He started charging five dollars, then eventually people were throwing him money to cut hair, and he’d have a line of people waiting for him.”  Recently, Dominic worked mostly as a mobile barber, operating under the name Thy Kingdom Cutz. And he would often draw a crowd of clients whenever he set up a chair at an area barbershop. He even gave free haircuts to people in need.  “He would add an extra touch and make you look different,” his brother said. “I guess it was art. He saw the portrait and made us look better.”  Courtesy of Daniel Vasquez  Dominic had cut his brother’s hair the day before his death. They talked about his favorite car, a 1969 Camaro convertible.  He had dreams of setting up his own place and was close to saving enough money to make it happen.  Daniel Vasquez said he has received many messages about his brother from friends, former classmates and art teachers of the schools he attended, from elementary to high schools, including McCollum and East Central. He also at one point attended Kennedy High School, where he played football.  Some of his teachers have asked to continue displaying his art, the elder Vasquez said.  ALSO READ: Two critical after motorcyclist drives into pedestrians on West Side  Dominic also attended the University of the Incarnate Word, where he studied art and business management.

"accident","2020-05-12","Not Discerned","{""Fremont"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-06-02T00:09:00","FREMONT -- While cities around the Bay Area have tried some unusual tactics to deal with the homeless, large boulders that were placed to keep RVs from parking along Kato Road in Fremont a couple of years ago are sparking a discussion about safety.  The installation of the rocks has stirred controversy since their placement in 2020. A recent accident has elevated safety concerns.  On May 12, a 57-year-old woman sustained severe injuries when her vehicle collided with the boulders. She died six days later.  Fremont resident and member of the Mission Peak Conservancy Kelly Abreu says he's concerned and wants to warn others about the boulders on Kato Road.  ""The city is not listening to the motorists, because this presents a danger to motorists,"" Abreu said. ""The boulders were not intended to interact with the cars. They were intended to eradicate a homeless encampment. But the effect, especially on some of these sharp curves, is to put a dangerous obstacle right in front of the motorist. The fact that the motorists drove straight into the boulders and resulted in a fatality, that is a safety hazard that should have been foreseen and designed for.""  According to Abreu, the presence of these boulders has displaced many of the RVs that used to park on Kato Road. Now they can be seen lining Stewart Avenue, with a significant number of vehicles stretching along the road for miles.  ""The rate of homelessness has grown over the last couple of years. The latest survey showed a huge jump in homelessness in the Bay Area, especially in Fremont. The city lacks the resources to address this issue. Putting in boulders that are dangerous for motorists is not the way to address this,"" explained Abreu, highlighting the underlying problem that needs attention.  However, the city maintains that the decision to install the boulders was based on ensuring the security and well-being of people living in RVs. The limited space between Kato Road and I-880 is shared by a bike lane with heavy traffic on both sides.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL3NhbmZyYW5jaXNjby9uZXdzL2FjY2lkZW50LWNvbmNlcm5zLWJvdWxkZXJzLWthdG8tcm9hZC1mcmVtb250L9IBW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL2FtcC9zYW5mcmFuY2lzY28vbmV3cy9hY2NpZGVudC1jb25jZXJucy1ib3VsZGVycy1rYXRvLXJvYWQtZnJlbW9udC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"accident","2023-05-18","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-06-01T12:44:37","Where a woman sued for injuries she suffered in a motor vehicle accident involving a tractor trailer, the defendant’s attempt to prevent the jury from seeing a 12-second-long video clip, apparently recorded from inside the truck’s cabin that shows the vehicles colliding, was denied. The evidence was relevant to the issue of resulting injuries and was not more prejudicial than probative.  Background  This case arises from a serious motor vehicle accident involving Yvette Norman and Julian J. Kaczor, who was operating a semitruck owned by Leonard’s Express Inc. The parties have filed several motions in limine that the court will address in turn.  Crash video  Leonard’s Express moves to exclude a 12-second-long video clip, apparently recorded from inside the semitruck’s cabin, that shows the vehicles colliding. The court finds that that evidence of the details of a motor vehicle accident are relevant to the issue of resulting injuries, and that this type of evidence is more probative than prejudicial. Finally, insofar as this video is the only non-testimonial evidence depicting, in real time, the accident at issue, it is not needlessly cumulative of eyewitness testimony describing the same.  But the audio heard in the video is inadmissible. When the accident occurs, Kaczor curses audibly. Even if that profane utterance provided some limited probative value on the issue of liability, it has no bearing on causation and damages. Any marginal probative value that an expletive may have is substantially outweighed by the risk of undue prejudice to Leonard’s Express.  911 call  Leonard’s Express moves to exclude a one-minute-long 911 telephone call made by Meghan Crjnak, an eyewitness to the crash. The court finds that the 911 call is relevant because the severity of the crash has the tendency to make it more probable that Norman sustained the injuries she now claims and to the degree that she alleges. But the court finds that any probative value of the 911 call audio is substantially outweighed by its risk of undue prejudice to Leonard’s Express.  PTSD  Norman asks the court to exclude evidence, suggestion, or speculation that she has post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, from experiencing Hurricane Katrina prior to the crash at issue in this case. However Dr. DeRight’s opinion was allegedly based on Norman’s statements to him, as reflected in his notes. Insofar as Norman contends that she never told Dr. DeRight that she had PTSD because of Hurricane Katrina — or that Dr. DeRight misinterpreted what she had said — that is not sufficient grounds to prevent Dr. DeRight from testifying on this issue.  Prior accidents  Norman asks the court to exclude evidence relating to three car accidents she was previously involved in, arguing that they are irrelevant and prejudicial to her case. Because Leonard’s Express has admitted liability, to be admissible, Norman’s prior accidents must bear on the issues of causation or damages. The court finds that the November 2018 and May 2019 accidents are irrelevant, but the October 2018 car crash is potentially relevant. But, to tie the October 2018 accident to this case, Leonard’s Express needed one of its medical experts to make that connection. Neither did, so defendant will not be permitted to suggest as much at trial.  Omnibus motion  Leonard’s Express complains that Norman did not disclose relevant pre-accident medical records. But discovery is closed and there are no outstanding motions to compel or extend Leonard’s Express’s expert disclosure deadlines. It will be prohibited from arguing or eliciting testimony suggesting that Norman withheld relevant pre-accident medical records in discovery, unless Norman admits to doing so.  Next, because the other occupants were positioned differently in the vehicle in which Norman was a passenger, the extent of their injuries is irrelevant to determining the existence and extent of Norman’s injuries and will be excluded. And any post-accident altercation that may have taken place between Norman’s son and Kaczor is irrelevant to the issues of causation and damages and may not be mentioned at trial.  Also Norman’s religious affiliation is irrelevant to the issues of causation and damages and so it may not be mentioned at trial. But to the extent that Norman’s level of participation in various life activities — including religious ones—may have been affected by the accident, that participation, and whether her activity level has been affected, is relevant to the issue of the existence and extent of her injuries. Finally the court will not exclude Stephanie Melancon’s deposition testimony based on genuine and justifiable confusion about her employer’s correct corporate name.  Norman v. Leonard’s Express Inc., Case No. 7:22-cv-00096, May 18, 2023. WDVA at Roanoke (Cullen).

Positive post-accident tests have been steadily increasing since 2012, with a 204.2% increase over a ten-year period.  According to Quest Diagnostics, the increase in positive tests corresponds to the legalization of marijuana (whether for medical or recreational purposes) in most states across the country.  Despite the increase in positive marijuana tests, the overall drug positive rate based on nine million urine tests remained at 4.6%, the same as in 2021 and the highest rate since 2001. Positivity for marijuana increased 10.3%, an increase to 4.3% compared to 3.9% in 2021. Positivity for amphetamines (both prescribed and illicit) also increased 15.4%, up to 1.5% from 1.3% in 2021.  Positive rates increased in most industries, with the highest increases in the Accommodation and Food Services, Retail Trade, and Finance and Insurance industries. Positive rates increased in states with legalized recreational marijuana (5.7%) and medical marijuana (3.9%), and in those that have not legalized marijuana (3.1%), but positive rates were higher in states with legalized marijuana.

Rescuers found no more survivors in the overturned and mangled wreckage of two passenger trains that derailed in eastern India, killing more than 280 people and injuring hundreds in one of the country's deadliest rail crashes in decades, officials said Saturday.  Chaotic scenes erupted on Friday night as rescuers climbed atop the wrecked trains to break open doors and windows using cutting torches.  The death toll rose steadily throughout the night. Scores of bodies, covered by white sheets, lay on the ground near the tracks while locals and rescuers raced to free the hundreds of people trapped in the rail cars under the twisted metal and broken glass. Army soldiers and air force helicopters joined the effort in Odisha state.  An Associated Press photographer saw bodies still entangled in a badly mangled coach, as rescuers struggled to retrieve them working under the oppressive heat with temperatures reaching up to 35 degree Celsius (96 degrees Fahrenheit).  ""By 10 p.m. (on Friday) we were able to rescue the survivors. After that it was about picking up dead bodies,"" Sudhanshu Sarangi, director of Odisha state's fire and emergency department, told The Associated Press. ""This is very, very tragic. I have never seen anything like this in my career.""  At least 280 bodies were recovered overnight and into Saturday morning, he said. About 900 people were injured and the cause was under investigation.  The accident occurred at a time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi is focussing on the modernization of the British colonial-era railroad network in India, which has become the world's most populous country with 1.42 billion. Despite government efforts to improve rail safety, several hundred accidents occur every year on India's railways, the largest train network under one management in the world.  People walk past the site of passenger trains that derailed in Balasore district, in the eastern Indian state of Orissa, Saturday, June 3, 2023. AP Photo/Rafiq Maqbool  Modi flew to the crash site and spent half an hour examining the relief effort and talking to rescue officials. He was seen giving instructions on the phone to officials in New Delhi.  He later visited a hospital where he walked around inquiring from doctors about the treatment being given to the injured, and spoke to some of them, moving from bed to bed in a ward.  Modi told reporters that it was a sad moment and he was feeling the pain of those who have suffered in the accident. He said the government would do its utmost to help them and strictly punish those found responsible.  Modi on Saturday was supposed to inaugurate a high-speed train connecting Goa and Mumbai that is equipped with a collision avoidance system. The event was canceled after Friday's accident. The trains that derailed did not have that system.  Amitabh Sharma, a Railroad Ministry spokesperson, said the rescue work was near completion. Rail authorities will start removing the wreckage to repair the track and resume train operations, he said.  D.B. Shinde, a district administrator, said only five to six bodies remained trapped under a damaged coach and were difficult to recover.  ""We have deployed a heavy crane. Once we take them out, the rescue work will be over,"" Shinde said.  About 200 of the severely injured people were transferred to specialty hospitals in other cities in Odisha, said P.K. Jena, the state's top administrative official. Another 200 were discharged after receiving medical care and the rest were being treated in local hospitals, he added. Scores of people also showed up to donate blood.  ""The challenge now is identifying the bodies. Wherever the relatives are able to provide evidence, the bodies are handed over after autopsies. If not identified, maybe we have to go for a DNA test and other protocols,"" he said.  Ten to 12 coaches of one train derailed, and debris from some of the mangled coaches fell onto a nearby track, according to Sharma. The debris was hit by another passenger train coming from the opposite direction, causing up to three coaches of the second train to also derail, he added.  A third train carrying freight was also involved, the Press Trust of India reported, but there was no immediate confirmation of that from railroad authorities. PTI said some of the derailed passenger coaches hit cars from the freight train.  The rescue operation was slowed because two train cars were pressed together by the impact of the accident, Jena said.  Officials said 1,200 rescuers worked with 115 ambulances, 50 buses and 45 mobile health units through the night. Saturday was declared as a day of mourning in Odisha.  Villagers said they rushed to the site to evacuate people after hearing a loud sound created by the train coaches going off the tracks.  ""The local people really went out on a limb to help us. They not only helped in pulling out people, but retrieved our luggage and got us water,"" PTI cited Rupam Banerjee, a survivor, as saying.  Passenger Vandana Kaleda said that people were falling on each other as her coach shook violently and veered off the tracks.  ""As I stepped out of the washroom, suddenly the train tilted. I lost my balance. ... Everything went topsy turvy. People started falling on each other and I was shocked and could not understand what happened. My mind stopped working,"" she said.  Another survivor who did not give his name said he was sleeping when the impact woke him up. He said he saw other passengers with broken limbs and disfigured faces.  The collision involved two trains, the Coromandel Express traveling from Howrah in West Bengal state to Chennai in Tamil Nadu state and the Howrah Superfast Express traveling from Bengaluru in Karnataka to Howrah, officials said. It was not immediately clear which derailed first.  Ashwini Vaishnaw, India's railway minister, said a high-level probe would be carried out. The political opposition criticized the government and called for Vaishnaw to resign.  In August 1995, two trains collided near New Delhi, killing 358 people in one of the worst train accidents in India.  In 2016, a passenger train slid off the tracks between the cities of Indore and Patna, killing 146 people.  Most train accidents are blamed on human error or outdated signaling equipment.  More than 12 million people ride 14,000 trains across India every day, traveling on 64,000 kilometers (40,000 miles) of track.  Sharma and Pathi reported from New Delhi.

Two passenger trains and a goods train collided in an accident in the city of Balasore in Odisha state, according to state chief secretary Pradeep Jena.  The resulting impact killed at least 207 people and injured 900 people, Jena said on Twitter, citing the state’s disaster management agency.  Images from the scene showed rescuers attempting to find survivors in a damaged rail carriage. Video footage also showed upturned coaches littered across train tracks, and people climbing a mangled train carriage.  Friday’s rescue effort included more than 115 ambulances and several fire service units, say authorities.  The cause of the catastrophic crash has yet to be determined, Jena told CNN affiliate News18, emphasizing that the current focus is on ongoing rescue operations.  “We are only working (at) sending additional doctors, ambulances, buses, so all those things we are doing so we have not thought of asking what happened, how it happened,” he said.  One of trains involved in the accident is the Shalimar-Chennai Coromandel express, carrying passengers from West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee, Chief Minister of the state of West Bengal, said on Twitter.  The Coromandel travels through India’s east coast, between West Bengal’s capital Kolkata to the South Indian city of Chennai.  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted his condolences on Friday. “Distressed by the train accident in Odisha. In this hour of grief, my thoughts are with the bereaved families. May the injured recover soon. Rescue ops are underway at the site of the mishap and all possible assistance is being given to those affected,” he wrote.  Aging infrastructure  India’s extensive rail network suffers from aging infrastructure and poor maintenance – factors that are often responsible for accidents.  The death toll from Friday’s crash has already surpassed that of an infamous crash in 2016 – one of the deadliest in recent years – when over 140 people were killed in a derailment in northern Uttar Pradesh state.  In 2021, some 16,431 people were killed in nearly 18,000 railway accidents across the country. “Majority (67.7%) of railway accident cases were reported (as) ‘Fall from trains /collision with people on track,” according to a 2021 report by the National Crime Records  Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik said he will visit the site of the accident on Saturday morning to review the situation, the department said.  The families of those killed on Friday will receive $12,136, India’s Minister for Railways, Communications, Electronics and Information Technology has announced, with lesser amounts available to people who were injured in the crash.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMy8wNi8wMi9hdC1sZWFzdC01MC1kZWFkLWFzLXR3by10cmFpbnMtZGVyYWlsLWluLWVhc3Rlcm4taW5kaWEv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHluZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA2LzAyL2F0LWxlYXN0LTUwLWRlYWQtYXMtdHdvLXRyYWlucy1kZXJhaWwtaW4tZWFzdGVybi1pbmRpYS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"accident","2023-04-16","Not Discerned","{""Columbus"", ""Ohio"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-06-02T14:08:00","Jun. 2—COLUMBUS — Brian Hartline learned a lot this spring.  That includes when to call it a night.  ""There's nothing I can really say,"" the Ohio State offensive coordinator and receivers coach replied when asked about an early-morning ATV accident on his property April 16.  It prompted a 911 call and put him in the hospital less than 24 hours after the Buckeyes wrapped up spring football, but Hartline appeared none the worse for wear physically Tuesday at the Woody Hayes Athletic Center.  ""All I would say is that in hindsight, I probably would have rather just gone to bed instead of rode the side-by-side, but that's about all I can say,"" he said during his first scheduled interviews since the accident.  Hartline also described the situation as a learning opportunity before steering questions to football, another area with a lot of ground to cover as he moves into an expanded role that may include calling plays this fall.  After five years as Ohio State's receivers coach, Hartline was named offensive coordinator during the winter.  He got to see what that actually means in practice over the course of the spring, and his main takeaway was it takes away time.  ""I felt myself barking out, talking play-calling through the spring and that also limited my ability to bark at the receivers,"" he said. ""Just wearing the both hats, I definitely felt that a little bit, especially during practice. In between practice, I was fine.""  As far as who will call the plays when the Buckeyes open the season at Indiana on Sept. 2, Hartline deferred to head coach Ryan Day, who was not available for interviews this week, but the new OC said he felt spring was productive.  ""I think we did a good job competing, and we did a great job of trying to play the game as much as possible,"" he said. ""We scripted more live periods, not tackle but really put guys in position to grow and learn and to experience what it's like on a Saturday even though it's minimal of what it really is. But I think we did a pretty good job installing (the offense), of putting guys in position to make plays. And also new guys to put their best foot forward. That whole combination I thought was pretty well done.""  Much work remains, though, when summer break ends in late July and the Buckeyes return to the field as a full unit.  That includes forming the offensive identity and choosing many of the payers who will be charged with putting it into action.  No starting quarterback has been chosen, and multiple spots appear to still be up for grabs on the offensive line.  Ohio State does have a pair of experienced running backs to build around — TreVeyon Henderson and Miyan Williams — plus potentially the best wide receiver duo in the country in Marvin Harrison Jr. and Emeka Egbuka along with experienced tight end Cade Stover.  ""You want to get an idea of the people you want to go to start relying on,"" Hartline said. ""You want to identify points where maybe things need to improve. You want to start outlining guys you're going to count on in the fall, and then continue to develop them through summer. Identify individually and offensively things that we need to improve on but also things that we do well. At the end of the day coming out of spring, you want to start having an identity, and then putting those guys in position to create that identity is really important.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vb2hpby1zdGF0ZXMtaGFydGxpbmUtYWRkcmVzc2VzLXNwcmluZy0xNDA4MDAxMzMuaHRtbNIBU2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vYW1waHRtbC9vaGlvLXN0YXRlcy1oYXJ0bGluZS1hZGRyZXNzZXMtc3ByaW5nLTE0MDgwMDEzMy5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"accident","2017-10-06","15:00:00","Not Discerned","2023-06-02T22:48:29","After a minor car accident, you may initially walk away pain-free. However, that doesn’t mean you don’t have injuries.  Musculoskeletal damage can take time to present symptoms. It may take days, weeks, or even months for your injury to manifest. This is why experts advise that you seek medical attention immediately following any car accident, even a fender bender.  Common Injuries from Minor Car Accidents  You may think that a small accident couldn’t possibly leave you with an injury. However, medical professionals often see these common injuries after minor crashes.  Whiplash  Whiplash occurs when the small muscles, tendons, and ligaments in the cervical spine are suddenly jolted. This can lead to a misalignment of the spine. Swelling from these tears and strains can put pressure on your nerves, impacting the neck and shoulder area with pain and stiffness. It can also cause you to have more headaches that radiate from the base of your skull.  Lower Body Injuries  Your vehicle may not have much damage, but one common injury from these types of crashes is the imbalance of knee alignment. Your knees are bound together through an intricate system of muscles, ligaments, cartilage, tendons, and bone. The twisting motions from an accident can easily throw things out of alignment.  Pain and range of motion issues may occur immediately or may take time to develop. This is also true for the pelvis, hips, and lower back. Herniated discs are common from the jarring movements of a car accident, leaving with you a lifetime of aches and pains that may require surgery.  Steps to Take After Minor Car Accidents  Even if your accident seems to be a minor one, you shouldn’t assume you are fine. Adrenaline and shock often take over and mute the physical traumas in your body. This is why you should be sure to document your accident and injuries.  Even if you can walk away from the accident, seek medical treatment. It will be a huge relief if a medical professional declares you are free of injuries—but if not, you will have documentation to pursue compensation.  Take photos, too—both of any visible injuries and the damages done to your vehicle. When speaking to insurance representatives, be honest about any pain, discomfort, or symptoms you have. This ensures you protect your legal rights if you plan to file a claim.  Know the Statute of Limitations for Tennessee  After a car accident, you have a certain amount of time limit to file a lawsuit. The statute of limitations for personal injury claims—including car accidents—in Tennessee is one year from the date the accident occurred.  You will need to act quickly to meet this deadline or your claim may be invalid. This would forbid you from seeking compensation. However, certain exceptions exist that may permit you to go forward with your case. To make sure you file your case on time or determine if you meet one of the permitted exceptions, contact a Nashville car accident attorney.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vcml2ZXJqb3VybmFsb25saW5lLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9jYW4tYS1taW5vci1jYXItYWNjaWRlbnQtY2F1c2UtaW5qdXJ5LzcwNzM1L9IBWGh0dHBzOi8vcml2ZXJqb3VybmFsb25saW5lLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9jYW4tYS1taW5vci1jYXItYWNjaWRlbnQtY2F1c2UtaW5qdXJ5LzcwNzM1L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The victim had stuck her head out of the window to throw up and her head impacted with a large heavy metal mailbox,” said Emily Ward, spokesperson for the Edmond Police Department. “The juveniles stopped on the scene and gave first aid but they ultimately drove to her home where they called 911.”  The 17-year-old driver told police she had “an apple beer” at a friend’s house 45 minutes before getting behind the wheel. She told officers she “didn’t feel drunk” and “felt safe enough driving them home.”  The driver was arrested for DUI with great bodily injury after blowing a .04 during the breathalyzer test.

As Jeff Saenz tells it on social media, the last thing he recalls is the power going out. Then he woke up in a hospital, where doctors would eventually amputate both his hands.  When he walked outside to investigate the power outage, he touched a downed electrical line, setting much of his body aflame. His fiancee Monica freed his hands with a broom handle. But all that, he does not remember.  In an Instagram post he calls the experience “a crossroads.”  “Does this get the best of me? Am I done?” he asked himself. And thankfully, he continued, the answer was not only “no” but “f_ck no.”  What ensued has been one of the greatest local comeback stories in Dallas history.  A year after his accident, he “really got back to performing,” he told D.  Tonight members of Dallas’ music scene will celebrate Saenz at Double Wide with performances by The Texas Gentlemen and Saenz himself, otherwise known as Baby Snakes.  “Tonight we take the ⚡️power⚡️ back from the universe,” Saenz wrote. “Tonight we celebrate. Sure, the poster might have my name on it, but tonight is for all of us. Tonight is a reminder that we might not get a tomorrow, so do what you love TODAY.”  Show begins at 10, so there’s time. Cover is $15.  Central Track reported right after the first anniversary of the accident that a documentary about Saenz is in the works.  “When I met with him, seeing his attitude about life, the fact he was so grateful to be alive was incredibly heartwarming and inspiring,” movie maker Eric Foster told CT. “I can’t imagine losing your arms. Everything you could do before this now is off the table. To keep that positive attitude, it’s an amazing, powerful story.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vbGFrZXdvb2QuYWR2b2NhdGVtYWcuY29tL2FjY2lkZW50LWFubml2ZXJzYXJ5LWJhYnktc25ha2VzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Today, the former Selectman posted a comment on this blog claiming that the incident was a mishap with his new phone.  As I posted on Wednesday, the Southborough Police press release states that two juveniles reported that:  the [elderly male] approached them; tried to engage them in a conversation; and then proceeded to show them a pornographic video on his cell phone.  Parry’s comment confirms that the incident involved students from St. Mark’s School:  This is what happens — when you make a perfectly innocent mistake — by opening a new and complicated folding cellphone, in front of someone else, and you punch in an array of buttons and then you see you-know-what, and you immediately hide the phone and you feel embarrassed and apologize … but to make matters worse, you can’t get rid of the annoying image for several seconds, no matter which buttons you press. When you are 80 years old, these phone-computers can be a nightmare to operate. Fortunately I can prove this was an unfortunate accident, and this will be explained in court in future. It’s a long legal process. I apologize to the St Mark’s students once again.  Based on the Westborough District Court judge’s instructions that MetroWest Daily News covered in their article yesterday, it appears the incident occurred at Southborough House of Pizza. The paper had reported:  [David Parry] was ordered to undergo a mental health evaluation and any recommended treatment; have no contact with any minors and no unsupervised contact with minors in his home; to stay away from the Southborough House of Pizza and St. Mark’s School; and to stay away from all schools and parks.  He was also ordered to wear a GPS monitoring bracelet.  The 80 year old resident was a member of the Southborough Board of Selectman from 1995-2004. He has continued to be a vocal participant in Town politics, including posting comments and letters on this blog and bringing Citizen Petition Articles to Town Meetings. In 2014, 2017, and again this spring he campaigned to return to the board.  In a separate email this afternoon, Parry wrote that he would prove his innocence.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm15c291dGhib3JvdWdoLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA2LzAyL3BhcnJ5LWNsYWltcy1hbGxlZ2VkLXBvcm4tdmlkZW8taW5jaWRlbnQtYW4tYWNjaWRlbnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The strap flew out the truck’s window and wrapped around the drive shaft, nearly pulling her from the vehicle and severing her feet.  The Virginia State Police Association requested contributions to the VSPA Emergency Relief Fund since Aubrey’s father is a trooper, and said the girl was “air lifted to Roanoke Memorial Hospital for emergency surgery” on May 17 “to repair her amputated feet.”  “The injuries are horrible and painful for all involved,” the VSPA added in its statement. “Aubrey, Aubrey’s sister and Aubrey’s parents are having a real hard time coping with this painful tragedy. They need our love and they need our help financially.”  Aubrey reportedly endured six hours of surgery to save her feet. The VSPA told local NBC affiliate WSLS that her limbs “seem to be receiving good blood flow after being reattached.” She remains hospitalized, however, and has a long road to recovery ahead of her.  The girl is currently in the pediatric unit of the hospital “and will likely be in the hospital for a while,” according to a GoFundMe campaign set up to fund her medical costs. It also revealed that Aubrey has between 10 to 15 surgeries ahead of her.

It’s been five months since the actor was run over by a snowplow weighing more than 14,000 pounds outside his Nevada home, an accident that landed him in critical condition with blunt chest trauma and more than 30 broken bones.  The panel opened with Renner addressing the incident.  “Under the snowplow, it’s a different view,” he said. “But you know, no harm no foul, essentially. I’m coming back stronger.”  He’s been in recovery since the accident on Jan. 1, he said, drawing loud applause after saying, “It’s glorious to be full of love and titanium.”  Fan Fusion 2023 in Phoenix:Follow our updates of the good, the bad and the awesome cosplay  How is Jeremy Renner doing now?

Everything is just more intense since the accident. I’m not sure why, but it’s pretty killer because everything is just that much better. And being here is one of those things.”  Asked by a fan when he might return to work as an actor, Renner assured us that we haven’t seen the last of him.  “I’m not going anywhere,” he said. “My priorities have always been the same. They’ve been to my daughter and whatever my daughter allows me to do.”  Renner said his daughter is 10. When he talks to his agents, Renner said, he tells them, “Just ask my daughter if it’s OK if Daddy goes and does this thing.”  He's always happy to work, Renner said.  “If Marvel wants me back in the MCU, rocking that out, I’d do it in a heartbeat.

Renner talked about riding a snowmobile to work during the filming of “Wind River” (“a very special film for me”) and filming his first movie for the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Hawkeye, thinking, “I don’t know how you’re gonna put Fabio in the air with a hammer.”  He was heartfelt and candid and funny and just really down to earth, frequently bringing the conversation around to the daughter he clearly adores and can’t pick up right now.

Col. Brian Smith, Acting Director for the FWC Division of Law Enforcement. “I am proud of the effort our officers and boating and waterways staff put into getting boating safety messaging out to the public throughout the year and my hope is we will see both of these statistics decrease next year.”  Florida had 735 boating accidents in 2022, 16 fewer than in 2021. A total of 65 people lost their lives in these accidents, five more than the previous year. Since 2003, falls overboard has been the leading type of fatal accident, with drowning as the leading cause of death. Of the drowning victims, 81% were not wearing a life jacket. Today’s boaters can choose from several models of light and comfortable, inflatable belt-pack or over-the-shoulder life jackets. For more information about life jackets, visit: MyFWC.com/Boating and select “Safety-Education” then “Wear-It-Florida.”  “Accidents happen quickly and unexpectedly, and boaters might not have time to grab their life jacket before finding themselves in the water,” said Lt. Nicholas Korade, FWC Boating and Waterways Section. “The message is clear, ‘Life Jackets Save Lives.’”  The primary causes of all reported boating accidents (almost half, at 43%) were improper lookout or attention and operator inexperience. All vessel operators are responsible for always keeping 360-degree awareness since dangers are not always located ahead. Operator inexperience can be attributed to the operator’s limited time or experience with the vessel, the area or the weather.  Lack of boater education was also a contributing factor in accidents.  “The number of Boating Safety Education Cards issued in 2022 has tripled since 2010, but 45 of the operators involved in fatal accidents and 515 of the 926 operators in reportable accidents did not have formal boating education,” said Korade. “The FWC encourages all boaters, regardless of age or experience, to take a boating safety course for the safety of themselves and everyone on the water with them.”  Florida is recognized as “The Boating Capital of the World” and leads the nation with over 1 million registered vessels across the state in 2022. The FWC is responsible for reviewing, analyzing and compiling boating accident data for the state. Its statistical report details boating accidents and their causes.

Members of the RCSO responded to a call of a logging accident off of Turkey Bone Rd. near Monterville in Randolph County at around 2:10 p.m. on Thursday, according to a release from the department.  Emergency crews responded to the scene that was 8.5 miles off of Rt. 15 on Turkey Bone Rd. and 4.3 miles on a logging road to a log landing. Police say the accident happened nearly a mile into the woods where the logs were being cut down and harvested.  HealthNet was alerted, but it was ultimately not needed, authorities say.  Investigators determined 54-year-old David Moreland, of Schere, was preparing to secure a log that had been cut down as a bulldozer approached with a cable to remove the log, the release says. A tree uphill uprooted and fell toward the bulldozer and Moreland. Authorities say Moreland was struck by the tree and succumbed to his injuries.  The RCSO says Moreland was a 15 year veteran employee of the logging company.  Authorities are working with the Medical Examiner’s Office and OSHA as the investigation continues.

Authorities said they were still searching for a missing man in his 30s who was a member of the fishing party and remained unaccounted for.  The bodies of the four children — all minors older than 10 — were found unresponsive on the river bank a few hours after authorities received an emergency call about a group that had been swept up by the tide near Portneuf-sur-Mer, about 550 kilometers (341 miles) northeast of Montreal.  They were among a group of 11 people who were fishing for capelin on foot near the shore when they were caught off guard by the rising tide.  Quebec provincial police divers and Canadian Forces members took part in the search for the missing adult.  Mayor Jean-Maurice Tremblay said Saturday he did not know more about the victims or if they were from Portneuf-sur-Mer, a community of about 600 people.  “Everyone is affected by what happened, because this kind of event, it’s the first time it’s happened,” Tremblay said in French. “When it involves five people, and four children drowning during a recreational activity, it’s certain people are quite sad about it.”  Capelin — a silvery smelt fish — are a forage species consumed by many marine animals, and Tremblay said fishing for them is a popular activity in his part of Quebec’s north shore. It is done on the banks of the river using scoops rather than fishing lines.  Capelin most often roll at night, so people light a fire on the shore and wait, Tremblay added.  Tremblay said the sandbank on which the victims were fishing is accessed by all-terrain vehicles. They were caught on a part of the peninsula where parts can be submerged by up to four meters of water when the tide rises.  A 911 call came in at about 2 a.m. on Saturday, and police say six people were rescued from the water and five others were reported missing — the four victims and the missing man.  The bodies of the four children were transported to a nearby health clinic where a doctor confirmed their deaths.  Police investigators and forensic teams have been deployed to shed light on what happened.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vSW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC93aXJlU3RvcnkvNC1raWRzLWRyb3duLW1hbi1taXNzaW5nLWFmdGVyLXF1ZWJlYy1maXNoaW5nLTk5ODE2NDc40gFpaHR0cHM6Ly9hYmNuZXdzLmdvLmNvbS9hbXAvSW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC93aXJlU3RvcnkvNC1raWRzLWRyb3duLW1hbi1taXNzaW5nLWFmdGVyLXF1ZWJlYy1maXNoaW5nLTk5ODE2NDc4?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Multiple sources confirm to 7 Action News that the driver, a 25-year DDOT employee, was behind the wheel in 2015 when she ran over Joey Davis.  After reaching his stop, Davis walked off the bus and retrieved his bicycle from a rack attached to the front.  RELATED: Detroit bus accidents cripple victims, cost city millions in payouts  Surveillance video showed that the female bus driver appeared to be looking in her rear-view mirror—and not at the man in front of her bus—when she took her foot off the brake and drove over him.  Davis died later at the hospital and his family sued the city, settling for $4.5 million.  Despite the considerable settlement, the city did not fire Davis. Instead, she was retrained by the city and remained a DDOT bus driver.  7 Action News first revealed that the driver remained with the city during an investigation in 2017.  Detroit police are investigating Friday’s accident, where the victim was struck near Griswold and Congress downtown.  According to DPD, the bus was going westbound on Congress and stopped to turn onto southbound Griswold at the time of the accident.  The victim was also walking westbound in the crosswalk on Congress. She was reportedly on the way to work in the Buhl Building.

One train in Friday's accident also hit a freight train parked nearby in the district of Balasore in Odisha state in the east of the country, leaving a tangled mess of smashed rail cars and injuring 803.  The death toll has reached 288, said K. S. Anand, chief public relations officer of the South Eastern Railway.  Dead bodies are still trapped in the mangled coaches and the rescue operation is continuing, a Reuters witness said, while the death toll is expected to rise.  A preliminary report indicates that the accident was the result of signal failure, Anand said.  ""The Coromandel Express was supposed to travel on the main line, but a signal was given for the loop line instead, and the train rammed into a goods train already parked over there. Its coaches then fell onto the tracks on either side, also derailing the Howrah Superfast Express,"" he said.  Surviving passenger Anubha Das said he would never forget the scene. ""Families crushed away, limbless bodies and a bloodbath on the tracks,"" he said.  Video footage showed derailed train coaches and damaged tracks, with rescue teams searching the mangled carriages to pull the survivors out and rush them to hospital.  Dead bodies were lying on the bloodstained floor of a school used as a makeshift morgue, and police helped relatives identify the bodies, covered with white cloths and placed inside chained bags.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived at the scene, talked to rescue workers and inspected the wreckage. He also met the survivors at hospitals.

""Our complete focus is on the rescue and relief operation, and we are trying to ensure that those injured get the best possible treatment.""

Video footage from Friday showed rescuers climbing on one of the mangled trains to find survivors, while passengers called for help and sobbed next to the wreckage.  ""We rescued at least 30 people, and some of them managed to survive, but three or four of them died,"" said Sanjeev Rout, an electrician. A few metres away, rescue workers tried to cut their way into a damaged red-coloured coach.  The collision occurred at around 7 p.m. (1330 GMT) on Friday when the Howrah Superfast Express from Bengaluru to Howrah in West Bengal collided with the Coromandel Express from Kolkata to Chennai.  Indian Railways says it transports more than 13 million people every day. But the state-run monopoly has had a patchy safety record because of ageing infrastructure.  Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik described the crash as ""extremely tragic"".  Opposition Congress party leader Jairam Ramesh said the accident reinforced why safety should always be the foremost priority of the rail network.  Modi's administration has launched high-speed trains as part of plans to modernise the network, but critics say it has not focused enough on safety and upgrading ageing infrastructure.  Experts said Friday's train accident came as a blow to Modi's makeover plans for railways.  India's deadliest railway accident was in 1981 when a train plunged off a bridge into a river in Bihar state, killing an estimated 800 people.

The death toll is expected to rise as more people are feared trapped inside the mangled train cars.

On Saturday morning, the Indian army joined National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), police, and other rescue teams to find survivors.  People inspect the site of passenger trains that derailed in Balasore district, in the eastern Indian state of Orissa, Saturday, June 3, 2023. Rescuers are wading through piles of debris and wreckage to pull out bodies and free people after two passenger trains derailed in India, killing more than 280 people and injuring hundreds as rail cars were flipped over and mangled in one of the country's deadliest train crashes in decades. Rafiq Maqbool / AP  ""We are not very hopeful of rescuing anyone alive,"" Sudhanshu Sarangi, Odisha's Fire Services Chief told reporters on Saturday morning.  Odisha's Chief Secretary Pradeep Jena said more than 200 ambulances were in service, shifting the injured to hospitals. The surge of dazed and bleeding victims overwhelmed small local hospitals which were not used to such a large influx of high-trauma patients.  Footage from the accident site showed bodies lined up on tracks and the injured being shifted to hospitals while rescuers desperately looked through the overturned and jumbled metal train compartments. The state government has announced a day of mourning. At least three trains were involved in the accident on Friday night. There is no official version of the sequence of events.  But according to local news media reports and eyewitnesses, a passenger train, the Coromandel Shalimar Express, derailed and hit stationery goods train at about 6:50 pm local time – resulting in many coaches flipping over. Then after about 20 minutes, the Yeshvantpur-Howrah Superfast train, approaching the accident site, rammed into the derailed coaches on the adjacent track.  ""As I stepped out of the washroom, suddenly the train tilted,"" passenger Vandana Kaleda told the Associated Press. ""I lost my balance ... Everything went topsy turvy. People started falling on each other and I was shocked and could not understand what happened. My mind stopped working.""  It's not clear why a second train approaching the accident areas was not stopped in time. But the Indian Railways has launched an investigation into the accident.  Amidst opposition calls for his resignation, India's Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw called the accident ""tragic"" and said all focus, for now, remains on rescue and relief operations. He added that a high-level inquiry committee has been formed to find the cause of the accident. A separate investigation will be carried out by the Commissioner of Railway Safety, he said.  India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who visited the crash site Saturday, said he was ""distressed"" by the accident and that in the ""hour of grief"" his ""thoughts are with the bereaved families."" He has called a meeting of senior officials to review the situation, pledging ""all possible assistance"" for the victims.  The Railway Ministry has announced a compensation of about $12,200 for the families of the dead, $2,440 for the seriously injured, and $610 for those with minor injuries.  India has one of the largest railway networks in the world where an estimated 13 million people travel on trains every day. But despite recent huge investments in a bid to modernize, a large chunk of the country's railway infrastructure is old and aging.  The latest train disaster is one of India's worst in recent decades. In 1981, more than 800 people were killed when a passenger train derailed and fell into a river in the eastern state of Bihar during a cyclone. More than 300 people were killed in 1995 when Purushottam Express collided with a stationary train in central Uttar Pradesh state. In 2016, 152 people were killed when a passenger train derailed in the same state.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvaW5kaWEtdHJhaW4tZGVyYWlsbWVudC0zMDAta2lsbGVkLWluLW9uZS1vZi10aGUtZGVhZGxpZXN0LXRyYWluLWFjY2lkZW50cy_SAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9pbmRpYS10cmFpbi1kZXJhaWxtZW50LTMwMC1raWxsZWQtaW4tb25lLW9mLXRoZS1kZWFkbGllc3QtdHJhaW4tYWNjaWRlbnRzLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

MAY 1923  100 Years ago  Alertness of engineer  prevents serious  accident Saturday  The place: Monroe Street crossing. The car: A flivver. Train No. 6. Time: 7:50 p.m.  You wonder what all this means? It happened like this: since the new brick road has been laid at the top of the hill at the mayor’s office, all traffic has been detoured either through the undergrade crossing in East Covington or else over the Monroe Street crossing.  Saturday evening many cars were using the Monroe Street crossing just about the time No.6 was due.  As the train, running at the rate of about 15 miles an hour, rounded the curve between Bath and Monroe streets, a small car attempted to cross the track ahead of the train. He made the crossing OK, but if the engineer failed to see the car was trying to beat him across the crossing the train would have struck the car and a serious accident resulted.  As it was, the engineer slapped the emergency brake and prevented the accident, but the air was applied so hard that it took the train crew 15 minutes to release the brakes.  MAY 1938  85 Years Ago  Novel materials used for swimsuits this year  Probably the outstanding feature about the new bathing suits which will be displayed at resorts and beaches this season is the use of novel materials and unusual fabrics.  Milady can have her choice of latex, satin, rubber, silk net, cotton and wool and, of course, even glass or copper if she wants something really different. No longer is a bathing suit sufficient for the resort. A beach costume includes sandals, cape, slacks, bonnet, bag for accessories, sunglasses and various other accoutrements.  MAY 1968  55 Years Ago  Carpenter named  best area coach  Joe Carpenter just finished his second season as head baseball coach at Alleghany County High School, and it was a season he’s likely to remember for the rest of his life.  Carpenter piloted the Colts to a sparkling 13-1 overall mark, the District 5 championship and the championship of the six teams in the Covington-Alleghany-Bath area.  The Alleghany mentor today was named the top coach in the area, winning over the other five coaches.  It was a close vote between Carpenter and Clifton Forge’s Richard Trimble.  Carpenter’s 2-year baseball record at Alleghany now stands at 22-5.  Carpenter was assisted by the personable Lee Dunn.  MAY 2008  15 Years ago  Kerns marks 50  years as a local barber  To celebrate 50 years of serving residents in the Alleghany Highlands, barber Johnny Kern in Clifton Forge took the day off on May 19.  Kern was born in Lick Run and still lives there.  He graduated from Eagle Rock High School, and while in school, worked for Jake Cook in his grocery store at Sharon delivering groceries and as a stock boy.  When he graduated, he found that jobs were scarce, the railroad in Clifton Forge had just put in diesel engines and cut off some men, so he and two buddies joined the U.S. Air Force in 1954.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiI2h0dHBzOi8vdmlyZ2luaWFucmV2aWV3LmNvbS8yNTI0MDMv0gEnaHR0cHM6Ly92aXJnaW5pYW5yZXZpZXcuY29tLzI1MjQwMy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(KTVZ) – A 50-year-old man was thrown from a motorized boat and seriously injured Saturday afternoon when it struck a submerged tree on the Deschutes River near La Pine State Park, Deschutes County sheriff’s deputies said.  The boat operator was cited for running the jet boat on a stretch of river that is closed to motorized craft, Sergeant Jason Wall said.  Wall offered additional details on Tuesday regarding the man's status and clarified that it was a motorized drift boat, not jet boat, that was involved in the crash.  The man was taken to St. Charles Bend, where he's being treated for 10 broken ribs.  ""His injuries were life-threatening at the time of the incident,"" he said. ""However, he's been relatively stabilized at the hospital.""  This accident is the first of its kind on the river this season.  Deschutes County Marine Patrol Deputy Terry Miller told us, ""This is a pretty infrequent thing, to have a boating accident on that stretch of river.""  According to both deputies, motorized boats aren't allowed on the Upper Deschutes. But this kind of accident is rare on that stretch of river.  ""We've had some incidents where basically kayakers or paddle boarders have basically ended up in the water, caught on snags and things like that,"" Miller said. ""So it's rare to even see one, let alone have an accident with a motorboat in that stretch.""  He also pointed out that water in the Deschutes River is colder than most places in the state, usually never getting above 55 degrees. That can lead to hypothermia, shortness of breath, and even render your arms and legs useless if you fall in.  ""Your body acts differently,"" Miller said. ""Your stamina goes way down, you cramp up. You might even gasp when you fall into it, and suck water into your lungs.""  Deputies were dispatched to the crash around 3:15 p.m. Saturday. Initial reports indicated the boat was traveling upriver when it hit the underwater tree, throwing one of the passengers, Wall said. Sheriff’s Search and Rescue also responded to the scene to assist La Pine Fire medics.  Wall said, ""Both people that were on the boat weren't wearing life jackets (but) had them accessible to them. A boating under the influence investigation was initiated, and it wasn't determined to be a factor --alcohol wasn't determined to be a factor.""  Miller says deputies have gone onto the Upper Deschutes and cleared out potential debris ahead of the warmer weather.  ""So we spend a ton of time talking to people out on the water and educating them,"" he said. ""We can back it up with a citation, but we try to get the word out with an educational approach.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL2t0dnouY29tL25ld3MvYWNjaWRlbnRzLWNyYXNoZXMvMjAyMy8wNS8zMC9qZXQtYm9hdC1oaXRzLXN1Ym1lcmdlZC10cmVlLW9uLWRlc2NodXRlcy1yaXZlci1uZWFyLWxhLXBpbmUtc3RhdGUtcGFyay1wYXNzZW5nZXItdGhyb3duLXNlcmlvdXNseS1pbmp1cmVkL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Katie Allan died at Polmont Young Offenders Institution in June 2018 aged 21 while serving a sentence for a driving offence.  William Lindsay died in October that year at the age of 16, days after being sent there on remand.  Scroll to continue with content Ad ADVERTISEMENT  A preliminary hearing for the Fatal Accident Inquiry (FAI) will be held on Tuesday July 11 2023 at Falkirk Sheriff Court.  Linda and Stuart Allan, the parents of Katie Allan, and their lawyer Aamer Anwar (centre) (Andrew Milligan/PA)  Solicitor General, Ruth Charteris KC, said she hopes the FAI will provide the families with the answers that they are looking for.  She said: “I acknowledge the deep anguish that the deaths of Katie and William have brought to their families.  “I met with Katie’s mother and father and William’s mother and brother, and having listened to them talk about their experiences I fully appreciate that the wait for these proceedings has been too long and distressing for them.  “My hope is that this inquiry provides them with the answers that they are looking for and helps to prevent similar deaths in the future.  “The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service has introduced a number of reforms designed to reduce the time it takes to investigate deaths, improve the quality of such investigations, and improve communication with bereaved families.  “As part of these reforms, a specialist custody deaths investigation team has been set up to focus on cases such as those of Katie and William.”  The families of Ms Allan and Mr Lindsay have long called for justice in relation to the deaths.  In a statement issued by solicitor Aamer Anwar on behalf of John Reilly, the brother of William Lindsay, and Linda and Stuart Allan, the parents of Katie Allan, they called for the lifting of Crown immunity which means that the Scottish Prison Service cannot be prosecuted.  They said: “We do not have the death sentence in Scotland but for William and Katie that is exactly what Polmont Young Offenders Institute meant. The lifting of Crown immunity must a priority for the Scottish Government.  “Whilst an FAI cannot apportion blame, the families of William and Katie hold the Scottish Prison Service and Health Service directly responsible for their deaths and will fight to ensure that other lives can be saved.  “The irony is that had Katie or William died in a private prison, a police cell or mental health hospital, it would have been possible to prosecute them.  “Crown immunity is a shameful abuse of power and in advance of the FAI both families are asking Justice Secretary Angela Constance and the Scottish Government what they intend to do about approaching the UK Government to save lives in our prisons.”  The two young people were being held at Polmont Young Offenders Institution (Andrew Milligan/PA)  Katie Allan’s parents Linda and Stuart Allan added: “This Sunday will be the fifth anniversary of our daughter’s death. We will spend the day reflecting on Katie’s life and all she meant to us.  “Katie’s life, like many other young people, meant nothing to the Scottish Prison Service. If it had she would not be dead.”  Mr Anwar said an evidential hearing is expected to start in January next year.  Unlike criminal proceedings, FAIs are inquisitorial in nature, and are used to establish facts rather than to apportion blame.  Story continues  The inquiry will explore the circumstances of both deaths, with particular focus on the Scottish Prison Service “Talk To Me” strategy in relation to the prevention of suicide in prison.  The purpose of an FAI includes determining the cause of death, the circumstances in which the deaths occurred, and to establish what, if any, reasonable precautions could have been taken, and could be implemented in the future, to minimise the risk of future deaths in similar circumstances.  A Scottish Prison Service (SPS) spokesperson said: “While it would not be appropriate to comment on upcoming proceedings, we recognise the profound emotional distress experienced by families in any instance when a loved one dies in custody.  “The welfare and safety of those in our care is a priority for the SPS. HM Chief Inspector of Prisons wrote there had been ‘considerable strides made in healthcare’ for young people at HMP & YOI Polmont, following an independent review in 2019.”  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: “Our sympathies remain with the families of Katie Allan and William Lindsay.  “We are determined any lessons that need to be learned will be, and that all appropriate agencies will look closely at the outcome of this FAI, as they should with all FAI recommendations.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vY2Euc3BvcnRzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL2pvaW50LWZhdGFsLWFjY2lkZW50LWlucXVpcnktZHVlLTEzNDQxMDczOC5odG1s0gFYaHR0cHM6Ly9jYS5zcG9ydHMueWFob28uY29tL2FtcGh0bWwvbmV3cy9qb2ludC1mYXRhbC1hY2NpZGVudC1pbnF1aXJ5LWR1ZS0xMzQ0MTA3MzguaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"accident","2023-05-31","14:00:00","{""Durban"", ""KwaZuluNatal"", ""SouthAfrica""}","2023-05-30T19:58:59","An accident injury can be a life-changing experience that leaves you with significant physical and emotional scars.  Getting involved in an accident is a traumatizing experience that impacts one’s physical, mental, and emotional well-being. The journey to recovery is often long and arduous, requiring medical attention, rehabilitation, and emotional support. Sadly, accidents cannot always be prevented; when they occur, they can leave behind a trail of destruction and loss. For this reason, knowing the legal steps after an accident is essential, mainly when it results in an injury. This blog post discusses the legal steps to take after an accident injury, how to protect your rights and interests, and what to expect from the legal process.  Seek Medical Attention  After being involved in a severe accident, the first step to take is to seek medical attention immediately. It is always crucial to see a medical professional, even if you feel fine. This is because some injuries, such as head injuries or internal bleeding, may not be immediately apparent. By delaying medical attention, you run the risk of worsening your injuries, which could have long-lasting effects on your health. In addition to the health risks, seeking medical attention immediately after the accident can serve as crucial evidence during your legal case. Therefore, seeking medical attention is not only important for your safety, but it can also play a significant role in securing the compensation you deserve.  Document the Accident and Your Injuries  After an accident injury, it’s essential to document as much information as possible about the accident and your injuries. This can include taking photographs of the accident scene, gathering witness statements, and writing down your account of events leading to the accident. In addition, keep all medical bills, receipts, and treatments that you receive after the accident, including any physical therapy or rehabilitation you complete. This documentation can be used to support your case and help you build a strong legal claim.  Contact an Experienced Personal Injury Lawyer  When facing the aftermath of an accident, it’s essential to take legal steps to protect your rights and seek the compensation you deserve. One of the most crucial steps to take is to contact an experienced personal injury lawyer. These attorneys have experience in helping victims of accidents or injuries caused by others’ negligence or fault. They can advise you on your legal rights, guide you through the claims process, and help you negotiate with insurance companies. In some cases, your lawyer may recommend pursuing legal action in court to achieve the best possible outcome for your case. It’s important to act quickly and contact a personal injury lawyer as soon as possible to ensure that you receive the justice and compensation you deserve.  Negotiate a Fair Settlement  A good personal injury attorney will help you negotiate a fair settlement with insurance companies or the other party’s attorneys. This settlement will cover any expenses related to your injuries, including medical bills, rehabilitation costs, lost wages, and any other damages you may have suffered. By having a skilled legal professional fight for your rights and interests, you’ll be able to focus on your physical and emotional recovery without having to worry about navigating the legal system.  Pursue Legal Action if Needed  If negotiations fail, don’t hesitate to pursue legal action. Your personal injury attorney will guide you through this process, advising you on the legal process and what to expect. Your case will be brought before a judge, and evidence will be presented to support your claim. By pursuing legal action, you hold the responsible parties accountable for their actions and send a message that you will not be taken advantage of after an accident injury.  An accident injury can be a life-changing experience that leaves you with significant physical and emotional scars. However, by taking the legal steps necessary to protect your rights and interests, you can overcome the incident and receive the compensation and justice you need to move forward. By seeking medical attention, documenting the accident and your injuries, contacting an experienced personal injury attorney, negotiating a fair settlement, and pursuing legal action, you can hold the responsible party accountable and receive the compensation and support you deserve.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FscmVhZGVyLmNvbS9vdmVyY29taW5nLWluanVyeS1sZWdhbC1zdGVwcy10by10YWtlLWFmdGVyLWFuLWFjY2lkZW50L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Use Next and Previous buttons to navigate  Hitting the road on her 2014 Honda Shadow Phantom, Meissa Neumann felt free and courageous, ready for adventure.  She often reserved weekends for long rides on country roads between her home in The Woodlands and Conroe. She dubbed her motorcycle “Zuko,” after John Travolta's rebellious character in the 1978 film “Grease.”  Growing up, Neumann would tinker in the garage alongside her father, Ernie. “I’ve always been that kind of girl,” she said. He taught her how to ride a motorcycle.  MORE FROM LINDSAY PEYTON: Humble woman skates 1,100 miles to Chicago to honor her late mother  In high school, she was the first girl to enroll in the dual-credit auto mechanics course through Lone Star Community College, earning a Level 1 Mechanics certificate. Then she attended the School of Automotive Machinists and Technology in Houston. She earned certifications as a cylinder head and engine block machinist.    Neumann took a job at JM Racing, a motocross shop in Conroe, and volunteered at God’s Garage, a faith-based nonprofit that donates and repairs vehicles for single mothers, widows and wives of deployed military.  By age 19, Neumann had purchased her first bike, a 2011 Suzuki Marauder. She upgraded to Zuko in March 2021.  Trauma blog To follow Meissa Neumann’s blog, visit phantomphorever.com. See More Collapse  About two weeks after her 21st birthday in August 2021, she went for a ride in the country, stopping at Starbucks on Lake Conroe on her way home.  As she was turning at a blinking yellow light, the car ahead failed to yield. It plowed right into her.  Rick and Gentry Stevens were pulling out of their neighborhood when they saw that traffic had ground to a halt. “I saw a motorcycle lying on the ground,” said Rick Stevens, a paramedic. He jumped out and rushed to help Neumann. Gentry Stevens directed cars around the accident.  Neumann was gasping for air. Stevens noticed that one of her pupils was like a pinpoint and the other was dilated.  “Typically, that means a brain bleed is going on,” he said. “Even though she had a full helmet on, the impact was so severe. I reported it to 911 immediately.”  The fire department and an ambulance arrived. Neumann was transported to Memorial Hermann The Woodlands Medical Center, a Level II trauma center.  Stevens feared the worst. “I’ve seen too many like this in my career, and it never turns out well.”  Police called Neumann's parents, informing them she was in serious condition. “We held onto those words,” Becky Neumann said.  By the time they arrived at the hospital, Meissa Neumann was getting out of her first surgery. She had a tracheotomy, a feeding tube and was sedated.  Severe brain injuries  She had arrived at the emergency room with significant injuries to her brain, explained Dr. Timothy Hodges, trauma medical director at the hospital.  Neumann had a subdural hematoma or brain bleed, on both the right and left lobes. Hodges said the resulting immense pressure on her brain increased the risk of a brain herniation, which is fatal.  “We hoped for the best, but prepared for the worst,” he said.  In addition to the brain injury, Neumann had pelvic fractures, a laceration across her right leg and a pulmonary contusion, or injury to the lungs.  The first order of business was getting a CT scan of her brain, Hodges said. The images revealed the immediate need for a craniectomy, where a portion of bone is removed from the skull to be replaced at a later date, and a ventriculostomy, a hole to allow for drainage of cerebrospinal fluid.  Dr. Geoffrey Zubay, neurosurgeon and director of surgical operations for Memorial Hermann Mischer Neuroscience Associates, performed the surgery.  Afterward, Neumann had to be propped up at a 30-degree angle, until the swelling in her brain went down. After two weeks, she had stabilized enough for pelvic surgery. She developed an infection, which postponed her cranioplasty, the replacement of the bone in her skull.  Neumann ended up staying in the hospital for five weeks.  Moving forward at TIRR  Neumann was transferred to TIRR Memorial Hermann in the Texas Medical Center in October 2021 and admitted into the Disorders of Consciousness Program, which is for patients with severe brain injuries that affect basic awareness.  Rehab is not always recommended to patients with disorders of consciousness, but Dr. Katherine O’Brien said that is contrary to what the research recommends.  O’Brien serves as lead neuropsychologist at TIRR and a clinical assistant professor with UTHealth Houston.  Without rehab, signs of consciousness could go unnoticed, and then patients do not get the necessary treatment. “It can be a self-fulfilling prophecy,” she said. “They don’t get better because they’re not receiving the care they need.”  TIRR’s ability to properly evaluate these patients completely changed Neumann's trajectory, she said.  “The number one goal is to identify whether a patient is in fact conscious or not,” O’Brien said. “I noticed right away that her right hand was moving around. It seemed restless. But she wasn’t looking at anything.”  O’Brien decided to place a pen in Neumann's hand and a piece of paper underneath. She began to scribble tiny marks that at first seemed undecipherable.  On closer inspection, O’Brien read “small iced chai.”  That made it clear that Neumann was indeed conscious, just unable to speak.  It wouldn’t be long before O’Brien brought Neumann her Starbucks order as a reward for passing her swallow test.  “We found we were able to ask her a lot of questions, and she could write the answers,” O’Brien said. “It was just very small and hard to decipher.”  At first, O’Brien thought that Neumann's vision was impaired, but after a week, she was able to see better. Her writing became clearer, and her personality began to show in her replies.  After four weeks at TIRR, Neumann was discharged. Because of her pelvic injury, Neumann was not able to undergo extensive physical rehabilitation yet, O'Brien said. Instead, she recommended home care.  “She has a phenomenal mom and dad who are always ready to do whatever was needed,” she said.  Look twice for motorcycles  When Neumann arrived home, she still had to receive medicines through a peripherally inserted central catheter, or a PICC line. She could not speak and was communicating only by writing and hand gestures.  A lift was required to help her get in and out of bed and into a tilt wheelchair. She could only eat mashed foods, and she wore a helmet since the bone plate was not yet back in her skull.  Rehab without Walls provided physical, speech, occupation and music therapy.  Neumann still remembers the first time she was able to speak — on Jan. 13, 2022, one week after her cranioplasty. Her therapists were leaving for the day and she said, “Goodbye.”  “They all started cheering,” Neumann said. “It was really cool.”  Her speech therapist taught her how to breathe again, how to read and worked on impulse control.  By January, she no longer needed the lift. The following month, she got a new wheelchair, specially designed for her needs. Since then, she has slowly moved out of the chair; she started using a walker and learning to support herself on standing bars.  In the fall, Neumann graduated from Rehab Without Walls. In December, she returned to TIRR for outpatient speech therapy. She also enrolled in occupational and physical therapy.  In April, she reached another milestone. “I took my first steps without holding onto anything,” she said. “I was so excited.”  Neumann participated in the Honor Walk for trauma survivors at the hospital on May 16. The following day, on National Trauma Survivors Day, she spoke at Memorial Hermann The Woodlands.  “All the doctors, medics, EMTs, all the people who helped — I got to meet them. I’m very grateful,” she said.  That included Rick and Gentry Stevens.  “It was amazing to see she survived,” Rick Stevens recalled. “My wife got a little emotional.”  Neumann is still working to recover her physical and mental abilities. She also recently joined a new virtual Trauma Survivors Support Group organized by Memorial Hermann.  Recently, Neumann bought a new motorcycle, a 1984 Honda Shadow, named “Ben,” after Benjamin Hammond Haggerty aka Macklemore.  “It’s a true vintage,” Neumann said. “But I’m still debating whether I want to ride again,” she said.  By sharing her story, she hopes others will take the Texas Department of Transportation motto “share the road” to heart. “Look and save a life,” she said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdXN0b25jaHJvbmljbGUuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9yZW5ldy1ob3VzdG9uL2hlYWx0aC9hcnRpY2xlL3dvb2RsYW5kcy13b21hbi1tYWtlcy1hbWF6aW5nLXJlY292ZXJ5LTE4MTE5OTczLnBocNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Huston “Smokey” White, who died in an accident at home on Monday while off duty.  White celebrated his 80th birthday in October 2022 and was still actively working at Vidalia Police Department. He became a police officer late in life after retiring as a lineman for Entergy.  VPD’s eldest officer, White entered the Alexandria Police Academy in 2008 at the age of 66 and soon became one of the oldest officers on record to complete the academy.  Email newsletter signup  This is no small feat, as the Alexandria Academy is known for its rigorous physical training, said Vidalia Police Chief Joey Merrill, adding that White was in great shape and had no trouble keeping up with younger officers.  “They had trouble keeping up with him,” Merrill said. “I would’ve traded four or five younger officers for four or five of him. Everybody looked up to him. He was one of the good ones, for sure. A great man who cared about his community and his department. It’s a sad time for Vidalia PD.”  VPD shared a photo of a badge with a black and blue ribbon around it on its social media page Monday, symbolizing the loss.  Other officers and people in the community quickly flooded the comments with words of sorrow, remembrance and encouragement.  White’s daughter shared what her father would say in times of heartache, “Hang in there, Cuz”.  White called everyone “Cuz,” Merrill said.  “He had a great life and was in good health,” he said. “We hate for something like this to happen. He was full of life. Everybody loved him. You didn’t have to worry about what he was thinking because he would tell you. He was a man’s man. If I had to pick someone to be with me on a call, it would be him.”  Until last year, White worked in the streets as a patrol officer when Merrill promoted him to investigator.  “He would work burglaries, murders, theft, home invasions and things like that,” Merrill said. “It was a little bit slower paced and I had to talk him into doing it.”  Vidalia Mayor Buz Craft said White was also well-known and loved by the community.  “Smokey was a beloved person in Vidalia,” Vidalia Mayor Buz Craft said. “He was such a sweet man and such a good man and was always kind and friendly. If you knew him, you loved him. On a day like today, Memorial Day, when we think of all our fallen heroes who worked to keep the freedoms we have, he did the same. He’s a hero in my eye. … Our hearts are heavy. He was a great asset.”  Captain Craig Godbold of VPD said White was unique as an officer and as an individual.  “You didn’t have to guess what his thoughts were because he would tell you what he was thinking and he didn’t sugarcoat it,” Godbold said. “He was honest in everything he did. He was a good policeman and he could work circles around any young officer. He passed the police academy at 66, and it was difficult. That includes PT and running every day. He was a good man and a good friend, and we’re going to miss him. … He’d do anything for you. This one is going to hurt for a while.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYXRjaGV6ZGVtb2NyYXQuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMzAvdXBkYXRlLXZpZGFsaWEtcG9saWNlLWNvbW11bml0eS1tb3Vybi1hZnRlci1sb25ndGltZS1vZmZpY2VyLWtpbGxlZC1pbi1hY2NpZGVudC1vZmYtZHV0eS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Buckeyes’ offensive coordinator and wide receivers coach spoke publicly for the first time since his April 16 accident, in which he was injured riding an all-terrain vehicle after midnight on his Delaware County property.  Hartline acknowledged in the Delaware County police report that he had been drinking before the accident. He was hospitalized overnight with unspecified injuries. The accident is still under investigation by the Delaware County Sheriff’s Office. No charges have been filed.  Hartline said he has fully recovered but did not want to rehash the incident in detail.  More:Ohio State football quarterback Devin Brown resumes throwing after finger surgery  “There’s nothing I can really say,” he said. “All I would say is that in hindsight, I probably would have rather went to bed instead of rode in a side by side.”  Asked if he believed he’d been fortunate to dodge a more serious injury, Hartline said, “It always could be worse,” adding later, “Everything provides a learning experience, and I would say it was a learning opportunity.”  More:Ohio State game vs. Notre Dame to kick off at 7:30 p.m. and televised by NBC/Peacock  Hartline, 36, has been doing plenty of learning since his promotion in January to coordinator. That bump came after he’d established himself as an elite position coach as both recruiter and developer of talent.  His exact role has yet to be defined. Head coach Ryan Day’s preference would be to hand off play-calling duties so he can be more of a CEO. But Hartline has never called plays.  “Coach Day will handle those kinds of questions, not me,” Hartline said.  He said he is settling in as a coordinator.  “I’m not to the point where I’m going to relax,” Hartline said. “I don’t know if you’re ever comfortable. I’m very honored to be in the role I’m in, and I’m not taking it lightly. I wouldn’t ever say I’m comfortable, but I like the path we’re on. I like the work that’s being put in, and I’m excited to watch the guys work and apply it through the summer.”  Hartline is also enthused about a new addition to the coaching staff. Joe Philbin was Hartline’s head coach with the Miami Dolphins from 2012-14. After Philbin was let go as the Dallas Cowboys offensive line coach after last season, he joined Ohio State as an offensive analyst.  “Having Joe has been great,” Hartline said. “I think that perspective he gives, the wealth of knowledge that he has as a position coach, a head coach, a football coach. I think everyone in the building can learn something from him.  “It’s pretty cool from my perspective to be around coach Philbin again in a different light, in a different way. I’m very happy he's here. He's a great addition to our staff.”  Get more Ohio State football news by listening to our podcasts.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kaXNwYXRjaC5jb20vc3Rvcnkvc3BvcnRzL2NvbGxlZ2UvZm9vdGJhbGwvMjAyMy8wNS8zMC9vc3Utb2ZmZW5zaXZlLWNvb3JkaW5hdG9yLWhhcnRsaW5lLWFkZHJlc3Nlcy1hcHJpbC1hY2NpZGVudC83MDI2NzIzOTAwNy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Police chief Bruce McNamee confirmed that officers responded to a call at 12:15 a.m. Tuesday of a vehicle accident, where they found the vehicle overturned and Ms. Fillion reporting mild pain. No one else was harmed in the accident, Chief McNamee said.  After taking the woman to the hospital, an officer determined that she showed signs of physical intoxication, he added. Ms. Fillion was charged with operating a vehicle under the influence, negligent operation, marked lanes, speeding and damage to property.  The vehicle hit four concrete pillars and a Comcast cabinet, Chief McNamee said. Internet and cable on Chappaquiddick remained out for the rest of the night and most of the day while Comcast workers made repairs that morning. As of Tuesday afternoon, the internet had been restored, he said.  “Apparently the vehicle was traveling at a very high speed,” he said.  The speed limit on Chappaquiddick Road is 25 mph.  No court date has been set yet, but Chief McNamee mentioned that the accident complicated what would otherwise be a standard drunk driving investigation. Unable to do a field sobriety test, hospital workers took a blood sample of Ms. Fillion to determine her intoxication levels, but have not yet received the test results.  “It was a relatively quiet weekend otherwise,” he said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vdmluZXlhcmRnYXpldHRlLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjMvMDUvMzAvd29tYW4tYXJyZXN0ZWQtY2hhcHB5LWNhci1hY2NpZGVudNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"accident","2023-05-28","Not Discerned","{""LasVegas"", ""Nevada"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-30T14:51:15","Note: This article contains mentions of gore and a vivid description of a car accident.  Tulsa-based punk band Cliffdiver were involved in a nearly fatal accident while en route to Punk Rock Bowling in Las Vegas. Somehow, a large chain link from a load-bearing strap flew off the back of a semi-truck, crashing through the driver’s side window, impaling bassist Tyler Rogers in the neck.  Guitarist and vocalist Matt Ehler took to Instagram to detail the freak accident. He began his post by explaining that this would’ve been the band’s first trip in their new van, saying “We were probably the most excited we’ve ever been to be spending the week together and getting back on the road.”  Ehler describes it as an “enormous BOOM that sounded like a cannon being fired at the entire front of the van.” Shards of glass and dust blasted into the van, and as the air began to clear, the band saw that Rogers was knocked unconscious. Drummer Eliot Cooper grabbed the steering wheel, keeping the van from going off the road. Simultaneously, Ehler scrambled to the front of the van and noticed that blood was spewing out of Roger’s neck region. His foot was locked onto the accelerator as the van barreled down the highway at nearly 80MPH. “Terrifyingly enough, my only thought was that Tyler is dead, and I need to get control of the van before the rest of us join him,” Ehler recounts.  Ehler managed to crawl into the front seat and slam on the breaks, maneuvering the van onto the shoulder. Vocalist Joey Duffy was quick to shout out first-aid instructions to Ehler and Saxophonist Dony Nickles. At this point, Ehler says that Rogers appeared to “gain the tiniest bit of consciousness…which was a relief, as we were all certain we had just watched our best friend die.” First responders soon arrived and told the other members that the actions they took not only saved Roger’s life but everyone else’s as well.  “The sheriff approached us and told us that they found a large steel chain link lodged in his neck. The only reasonable explanation of what happened is that a semi-truck was pulling a trailer that had a load-bearing chain strap that had snapped under pressure, launching the chain link across the interstate and through our van window into Tyler’s neck.” The ER determined that Roger’s carotid artery had been punctured. His other injuries included a lacerated jugular and fractures in his neck; he had also lost two liters of blood and needed emergency surgery.  “After coming out of a successful surgery, the doctors determined that brain damage would not be a threat and that the chain link struck his neck in such a way that it caused a hematoma and kept him from bleeding out… Every doctor has made clear that despite there still being a long road to recovery ahead and a lingering possibility of his carotid artery rupturing, this was nothing short of a miracle, and 99 times out of 1000, the patient wouldn’t walk away from this type of injury.”  Ehler helped create a GoFundMe to help cover Roger’s expenses, which includes his hospital bill, rehabilitation, lost income (due to his inability to return to work), and repairs to the van. Donations can be made here.  Ehler says, “Lastly, I just want to reiterate how grateful and appreciative we are to have so many friends and fans that care so much about what we do. This little family we’ve created is so important to me and so many others that it’s truly hard to fathom sometimes. So thankful that this wasn’t the end of Cliffdiver, and we get a second chance to continue spreading hope—no matter how cruel the universe can be.”  On May 28, the band announced via Twitter that Rogers had been discharged from the hospital. Ehler asks that everyone please respect Rogers, his family, and the band’s privacy at this time.  We at New Noise Magazine wish Tyler Rogers a quick recovery and send our thoughts to his family and the band.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3bm9pc2VtYWdhemluZS5jb20vbmV3cy1jbGlmZmRpdmVyLXN1cnZpdmVzLW5lYXItZmF0YWwtY2FyLWFjY2lkZW50L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Little Aubrey Scaletta — who recently underwent surgery to have her feet reattached — was riding in the back seat of the truck May 17 when she started fiddling with a ratchet strap, a belt used to secure cargo during transport, according to the the Virginia State Police Association.  “One end of the strap went out the window and became wrapped around the [vehicle’s] drive shaft,” reads the release, which was posted online asking for donations for Aubrey’s dad, Trooper Daniel Scaletta, and their family after his daughter’s “terrible accident.”  “As the strap turned around the drive shaft, Aubrey was almost pulled out of the window and the tightening strap severed her feet.”  The little girl’s sister was with her and witnessed the grisly accident.

Lauren Scaletta / Facebook  Aubrey poses here with her mom and the sister who witnessed the horror. Lauren Scaletta / Facebook  Aubrey was airlifted to Roanoke Memorial Hospital, where she underwent a six-hour emergency surgery to reattach her amputated feet, marking the beginning of what will be a long and painful medical journey.  “Both feet seem to be receiving good blood flow after being reattached, and as of this morning, doctors have taken off the ventilator,” VSPA told local TV station WSLS last week.  In an update on Facebook posted Wednesday, Aubrey’s mother, Lauren Wensel Scaletta, shared that her daughter was breathing on her own and was off her sedation medications.  Surgeons were able to reattach the girl’s amputated feet during a six-hour emergency surgery. Lauren Scaletta / Facebook  The mom of three said the family is hopeful that Aubrey will be moved from the pediatric ICU, where she has been receiving treatment for the past two weeks, to the pediatric floor at the hospital.  The girl is scheduled to undergo skin-graft surgery June 9.  “Right now it looks like we may leave the hospital at the end of June in a wheelchair with elevated legs,” Wensel Scaletta wrote. “The surgery team’s goal is to have her walking with braces, walkers and things by Christmas!  “While we realize these things are not a guaranteed, it was nice to hear what could be,” the mom added.  After being discharged from the hospital, Aubrey will require physical therapy at home or at an out-patient facility.

Two years later, he walked at his graduation.  DENVER — The journey back to recover begins with a single step, something that seemed almost unattainable two years ago when cross country runner Noble Haskell was in a car accident that injured his spinal cord and rendered him a quadriplegic. But both Noble and his mom Krisi knew it wasn't just possible for him to walk across the stage at his high school graduation, it would happen.

"accident","2023-05-28","Not Discerned","{""Aiken"", ""SouthCarolina"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-30T17:38:21","For most communities across America, Memorial Day events are typically a semi-solemn affair that combine celebrating the military’s achievements with reverence for members who have died in service.  But for the small city of Aiken, South Carolina, Monday’s observance occurred with the tragic Thursday death of Spc. Jayson Reed Haven fresh on everyone’s mind. Haven, 20, died when his military vehicle rolled over during training at Udairi Range, Kuwait, where the infantryman was serving a rotation with the South Carolina National Guard’s Bravo Company, 1st Battalion, 118th Infantry.  His unit was deployed to the small country in support of Operation Spartan Shield, a long-running “force pool” mission that stages National Guard combat troops at transit hubs there in case they’re needed for emergencies like the August 2021 evacuation from Afghanistan. Around 400 soldiers from the 34th Infantry Division’s Spartan Shield rotation — Task Force Bastard — were pushed forward to help secure Kabul’s Hamid Karzai International Airport.  Haven, who attended South Aiken High School, was mentioned several times during remarks at the local Memorial Day event. Tom Young, a state senator, implored residents to “remember his family in the weeks ahead and remember his sacrifice,” according to the Aiken Standard newspaper.  Dwight Bradham, an Army vet who serves as Aiken County’s top veteran service officer, told Army Times that his daughter attended Naval Junior ROTC with Haven during high school.  “This is just a loss for us here in Aiken County,” Bradham said in a phone interview. “He was a very sharp young man.”  Haven’s JROTC instructor, retired Col. Claude Davis III, was unavailable for interview. But he told the Aiken Standard that his “creative” and “resourceful” former student joined the National Guard to propel himself to his educational goals while serving as a machine gunner.  The South Carolina Guard’s leader, Maj. Gen. Van McCarty, also mourned Haven’s loss, saying “there are no words” that can fully capture the impact that losing a soldier can have.  “Soldiers and their families are the fabric that holds our...[organization] together.” McCarty said in a statement. “There is nothing that I can say or offer to the family of Spc. Haven, but know that my thoughts and prayers and that of a great many South Carolinians are with you. You are not alone in grieving; we are with you.”  The Guard and officials from U.S. Army Central, which administratively manages soldiers deployed in the region, noted that an investigation into the causes of the rollover remains underway.  A series of ground vehicle rollover deaths led a government watchdog to study such accidents. The Government Accountability Office’s summer 2021 report led the Army and Marine Corps to overhaul drivers training and institute other measures meant to reduce such crashes.  RELATED  It’s not clear yet what type of military vehicle Haven was traveling in, or whether he was in the gunner’s cupola, when the accident occurred. But some types of vehicles are more prone to these accidents than others, despite action from Congress meant to address the issue.  Lawmakers blasted Army and Marine Corps officials in April hearings for not completely using the $183 million that Congress appropriated in 2022 to retrofit old rollover-prone Humvees with anti-lock brakes and electronic stability control features that reduce the risk of such accidents.  The Army is taking “a combined approach of retrofitting our existing Humvees” and buying new vehicles that have the features, said Army Secretary Christine Wormuth in an April 19 budget hearing.

An ATV accident resulted in injuries and drunken driving charge Friday at an Elba campground.  The Winona County Sheriff’s Department responded to a one-vehicle accident just before 11:30 p.m. Friday at the Wilderness Campground.  Deputies learned the crash occurred when the driver, Mai Kongkeo, 33, of Rochester, lost control of the ATV on a gravel road in the campground.  After Kongkeo’s hat flew off his head, he hit the brakes hard and turned the handlebars sharply causing the ATV to rollover, law enforcement said. Kongkeo and his passenger, Christina Onsy, 29, of Rochester, were thrown from the ATV.  Onsy suffered a substantial injury to her right leg. The Altura Ambulance and Mayo Clinic Ambulance services responded to the scene, treating Onsy, and taking her to the hospital, law enforcement said.  While on the scene, deputies noticed Kongkeo showed signs of intoxication, which caused a deputy to take Kongkeo through standardized field sobriety tests.  Kongeo failed the tests, had a 0.13 blood alcohol content in a breath test, and was arrested for driving while intoxicated.  Deputies transported Kongkeo to the Winona County Jail. Law enforcement was granted a search warrant for a blood draw, which was been sent to the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension for testing.

(KFOR) – Edmond police released new details about the tragic accident, involving teen drinking over the memorial day weekend.  “Edmond 911 – what’s your emergency?” asked a dispatcher. “My daughter stuck her head out the window and now she’s bleeding,” said the caller.  On Saturday night around 11:45pm in Oak Tree a mother of a 15-year-old girl called Edmond Police.  “Female’s head of of the window. Vehicle was moving,” said a dispatcher over scanner traffic. “Has a head injury now.”  The Edmond Police report detailed what happened during the moments before the call to 911.  The 17-year-old driver told police she had “an apple beer” at a friends house 45 minutes before getting behind the wheel. She told officers she “didn’t feel drunk” and “felt safe enough driving them home.”  “Our younger kids, the tolerance level obviously is not there,” said Chief Greg Giltner, the former chairman of the court-ordered DUI program Victim’s Impact Panel. “So the impairment usually hits them much faster and it will affect them on their critical thinking.”  The teen driver told Edmond PD her 15-year-old friend, a passenger in the car, “had to throw up.” When the car stopped, the passenger said she felt better. Then the driver heard a loud noise after driving off.  “Her head impacted with a large metal mailbox,” said Emily Ward, a spokesperson for the Edmond Police Department.  The 17-year-old driver told police she looked back and saw the 15-year-old “hanging from her waist outside the window.”  “I think she’s having some seizures right now,” said a neighbor on the 911 call.  Police said the 15-year-old was rushed to the hospital where she had surgery to relieve brain pressure. She is still in the ICU.  Edmond Police said the driver blew a .04 during the breathalyzer test. The legal limit for an adult is .08.  “If she’s a 04, typically that would be a couple of drinks,” said Giltner. “Legally she can’t have any of that.”  The 17-year-old was arrested for DUI and great bodily injury. That is a felony.  “A felony arrest on a on a person under 21 that affects jobs, you know. It could also affect this this person getting your driver’s license,” said Giltner. “I’ll guarantee they did not leave the house that night wanting to hurt their friend.”  “At the end of the day, if you drink you should not drive,” said Jerod Breit, a spokesman for the group Mother’s Against Drunk Driving (MADD). “It almost always ends in tragedy.”  Breit said the statistics show this incident could’ve ended another way.  “Teen drinking kills about 4,300 people each year,” said Breit. “This is 100% preventable crime.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8va2Zvci5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9lZG1vbmQtcGQtcmVsZWFzZS1yZXBvcnQtaW4tdGVlbi1kcnVuay1kcml2aW5nLWFjY2lkZW50L9IBWGh0dHBzOi8va2Zvci5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9lZG1vbmQtcGQtcmVsZWFzZS1yZXBvcnQtaW4tdGVlbi1kcnVuay1kcml2aW5nLWFjY2lkZW50L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Cape Lookout National Seashore confirmed that the incident happened Sunday, May 28th in the ocean south of Shackleford Banks. It involved three individuals who had rented a boat.  After the accident occurred, the three ejected passengers made it to Shackleford Banks. Upon reaching the beach, one male victim in his mid-forties collapsed around the wave line.

Many believe Morgan has already left quite the legacy on the North Carolina political landscape. He worked on democratic political campaigns for both Middleton and Durham County district attorney Satana Deberry.  ""My initial campaign manager ghosted me. Somebody referred me to Conen. In addition to becoming my campaign consultant, he became a trusted advisor and really good friend,"" she said. ""I could see him in the future providing advice to presidents.""  He worked alongside Dr. Kimberly Hardy for several years. She is the second vice chair of the North Carolina Democratic Party.  ""He wanted to be governor of North Carolina.

Walker's father, 30-year-old Christopher Maassen, was driving a pickup truck on the farm when stopped to unhook a trailer, according to a news release from the Sioux County Sheriff's Office. As he resumed his drive, he apparently struck his 20-month-old son, the release said.  Officials told the Register they have no plans to file charges and believe the child's death was an unfortunate accident.  ""Nobody saw him,"" Amy Maassen said.  She recalls her husband bringing Walker to the front of the house, where they tended to him until EMS arrived, her three other children watching. Maassen said in that moment they could sense things weren't looking good.  He later died at Sioux Center Health.  Born Sept. 4, 2021, Walker loved living on the family farm. ""He was always eager to help with chores or hop into the skid loader whenever the opportunity presented itself,"" his obituary said.  ""Anybody who met him instantly fell in love with him,"" Maassen said. ""He had the biggest smile and always was waving at people.""  Two days before the accident, the family went to the Great Plains Zoo in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Maassen remembers him running around and loving every second of it.  The day he died was no exception: ""that kid had a smile on his face the entire day until he could not smile anymore,"" she said.  Maassen said since his funeral May 12, she's had time to reflect on the things that matter most in life — her family.  ""When you're with your kids, be with them. Not on your phones. Be with your kids 100% and just be in the moment,"" she said.  And the community has been there for Maassen since the tragic accident, with so many people wanting to cook family meals and do chores. A meal train organized by Walker's grandmother Sandy Bakker has meals planned for the family until after the Fourth of the July.  ""It literally blows our minds how caring and compassionate someone can be who has never met you in their life,"" Maassen said. ""It's very humbling and overwhelming at the same time.""

On Monday, Ng Wen Xun, 35, who had failed to keep within the 80kmh speed limit while she was driving a car, was sentenced to 30 months’ jail and disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for 10 years from her release date.  She had pleaded guilty to two charges under the Road Traffic Act.  Ng was speeding along the CTE towards Seletar Expressway at around 9.20pm on July 23, 2021, when she failed to maintain proper control of her vehicle, and it struck a centre guard railing before veering to the left.  Her vehicle then collided into a motorcycle, throwing its 31-year-old rider onto the road.  Following that, her car veered right and struck a second motorcycle, a lorry and another car.  The second motorcyclist, 28, was also flung onto the road, while the lorry toppled onto its right side, causing two of its Bangladeshi passengers to be flung from their rear passenger seats onto the road.  Ng’s car then hit the left side guard railing along the CTE, came to a halt and caught fire.  The authorities were alerted soon after, and the older motorcyclist was unconscious when an ambulance took him to Tan Tock Seng Hospital. He died of multiple injuries later that evening.  Most of the other motorists were also taken to the same hospital, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Chin Jincheng.  One of the Bangladeshis, 26, suffered injuries, including a fracture to his left wrist, and was discharged with nine days of medical leave.

The collision happened at about 1:50 a.m. along Vineyard Road westbound, close to Cook Riolo Road.

However, friends of one of the decedents have identified them as Lane Castro, 21, of Roseville.  When a Loved One Dies, How Can You Recover Compensation?  In a fatal car accident caused by someone else’s negligence, losing a loved one is a challenging experience. Survivors of a deceased loved one may be able to bring a wrongful death lawsuit in California to recover financial compensation for their loss. Placing a claim holds the at-fault party responsible and can help give surviving family members a sense of justice for their personal loss.  In California, a claim for wrongful death can be brought by the surviving spouse and children of the decedent or other family members if the deceased had no immediate family. In addition to car accidents, product liability and other types of negligence can cause wrongful deaths.  Proof of Negligence in a Wrongful Death  There are specific requirements that must be met in order to file a wrongful death claim in California:  A duty of care was owed by the negligent party to the individual who died.  That duty was breached when the accident occurred.  Negligence by the at-fault party caused or contributed to the death.  The survivors have suffered damages as a result of the death of the family member.  Recoverable Damages in Wrongful Death Cases  A variety of damages may be recoverable for the surviving family members if the above requirements are met, including:  The cost of the funeral and burial  Financial support the decedent contributed to the family, which is recoverable until the normal age of retirement  Companionship, love and consortium are all lost by the spouse  The children’s loss of their parent’s love, affection and guidance  Exceptionally egregious negligence may merit punitive damages  Getting in Touch With a Wrongful Death Attorney  A California wrongful death attorney can assist you if you have lost a loved one in a fatal accident.

Sarcev claimed that four vehicles contributed to the car crash, with Sarcev being the first to be hit. “So I was the first one hit, I hit the car in front of me, and that car hit another car,” he said.  The Serbian bodybuilder disclosed that the first car that hit him had three babies as passengers, which further added to the trauma. “In the first car there were three little babies, you know, so this is the thing when you put things in perspective, how bad could it be right,” he reflected.  Thus, he felt grateful that he was the one who took the majority of the impact, as the car hit him. Had it been the other way around, it would’ve been a disaster. “So god probably put me there to protect them, you know, because I took the impact,” he expressed. Moreover, it was later found that the cars were on the move when the incident took place, and none stopped even after. “It was bad, it was a shocker,” Sarcev concluded.

"accident","2023-05-31","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-29T09:06:48","ARTICLE  Australia: I have been injured in a motor vehicle accident in NSW – what steps should I take right now?  To print this article, all you need is to be registered or login on Mondaq.com.  We want to make it easy for you to understand your rights to compensation and the steps to take if you have been injured in a motor vehicle accident in NSW. At a time when you are most likely not feeling your best physically and psychologically, the process might be overwhelming. With this easy guide from Carroll & O'Dea Lawyers, you can follow the step by step the process you should take if you have been injured as a consequence of a motor vehicle accident in NSW.  Who can make a claim?  Anyone that is injured in a motor vehicle accident in NSW can apply for statutory compensation benefits. This includes those 'at fault' drivers as well as 'not at fault drivers, passengers, riders and pillion passengers, pedestrians, and cyclists.  Step 1 – Report the motor vehicle accident to police.  You should report the motor vehicle accident to police as soon as possible and obtain an event number from them. It's important that you do this within 28 days. You should also exchange details with the other driver, including obtaining their name, contact details and relevant compulsory third party (CTP) and comprehensive insurer. If police are unable or not required to attend the accident scene, you can report either by attending your local police station or contacting the Police Assistance Line on 131 444.  Step 2 – Seek medical attention.  If you have been injured but do not require an ambulance to be transported to hospital from the scene of the accident, it is important to attend your General Practitioner or an Emergency Department to see a doctor as soon as possible. You should also ask your doctor to complete a certificate of fitness. This form should be completed regardless of whether you are working at the time of the accident or not.  Step 3 – Make a claim for personal injury benefits.  You should complete an Application for personal injury benefits form and provide this form to the relevant CTP insurer, that is, the CTP insurer of the vehicle that you consider caused the motor vehicle accident. This can be done by providing the completed form with your certificate of fitness to the CTP insurer by email. The claim must be lodged within three months after the date of the accident, or within 28 days if you want to claim loss of earnings from the day following your motor vehicle accident, if you have been unable to return to work. Once you have lodged the Application with the insurer, they have 4 weeks to assess your claim.  What am I entitled to if I make a claim for personal injury benefits?  You are entitled to 52 weeks of benefits for:  Reasonable and necessary medical and treatment expenses; Weekly payments of compensation for your loss of earnings; Paid domestic and personal care if you need assistance while you recover from your injuries.  Reasonable and necessary medical and treatment expenses  The insurer may pay for things such as medical, dental and pharmacy expenses, rehabilitation treatment such as physiotherapy and the costs associated with you travelling to and from these appointments.  Weekly payments of compensation for your loss of earnings  Weekly payments of compensation are paid to you as a percentage of your pre-accident earnings.  (i) For the first 13 weeks the maximum is 95 per cent of your pre-accident earnings;  (ii) After 14 weeks the maximum is 85 per cent of your pre-accident earnings and the amount will depend on whether you have total or partial loss of earning capacity.  (iii) After one year, weekly payments of compensation will end if you were at fault or most at fault for the accident or your injuries are assessed as 'threshold' injuries as defined by the Motor Accidents Injuries Act 2017 (NSW) which defines them as soft tissue injuries or a psychological or psychiatric injury that is not a recognised psychiatric illness.  Paid domestic and personal care if you need assistance while you recover from your injuries  While there is no entitlement to payment of gratuitous attendant care services, that is, care that is provided to you by a family member or friend that you have not been required to pay for, the insurer may pay for paid domestic and personal care if you require professional assistance at home while you recover for your injuries.

The crash happened shortly before 8:00 a.m. near the intersection of Forty Mile and Wheatland roads, between a Ford sedan and a Dodge pickup. Debris was strewn on the roadway, and the California Highway Patrol (CHP) called emergency responders with the Yolo County Fire Department to the scene to assess one unconscious person.  Cause of Fatal Car Accident Being Determined  The pickup had gone down an embankment and had to be brought back up to the roadway. The Ford sedan sustained major front-end damage, and the driver died at the scene. The deceased individual’s identity will not be released until the county coroner’s office has notified the family. A determination of how the accident happened and fault is underway by CHP traffic investigators.  Negligence and Filing a Wrongful Death Claim  When a loved one dies due to the negligence or careless behavior of another person or party, the survivors may have legal recourse in filing a wrongful death claim. Wrongful death claims are civil suits that seek financial compensation from the responsible party for their actions that resulted in an untimely and preventable death. Although the family’s grief won’t be eased, by filing a claim, they can avoid the financial distress that often accompanies a sudden death and obtain justice knowing the guilty party is being held responsible.  Obtaining the Proof of a Wrongful Death  To file a successful wrongful death claim following a fatal car accident, it is important to prove that the at-fault party acted negligently and breached a duty of care they owed to the deceased individual. This can be done by showing evidence of recklessness or intentional misconduct on behalf of the at-fault party, such as driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, speeding, distracted driving, or other types of negligence.  Compensation Recovery in a Fatal Car Accident  Wages and the age of the deceased are among the factors that determine compensation recovery. It is possible, however, for immediate family members (spouses and children) to recover damages for:  The funeral and burial expenses are reimbursable.  Up to the time the deceased loved one would have retired, their earnings can be reclaimed. The benefits can include pensions, insurance, bonuses, and tips, as well as any other income they usually receive.  Loss of consortium , emotional support, and love may be claimed by the deceased’s spouse.  A claim for the loss of parenting, guidance, and nurturing may be filed by children (including adopted children or stepchildren who received half their support from the decedent).  It can be claimed that the family lost household help because they now have to pay or find someone else to do the tasks that the decedent used to do regularly.

Narrated by FirstEnergy safety spokesman Max Safety, the video details how to identify risks surrounding an accident, including utility poles, power lines or transformers in contact with the vehicle.  “Car accidents involving utility equipment are especially dangerous due to the potential for live wires,” said Candy Webb, manager, Public Safety at FirstEnergy.  “We encourage schools, driver education teachers and first responders – and anyone who gets behind the wheel – to watch and share the video, which provides guidance about the best way to handle this type of situation.”  The video can be accessed for free on FirstEnergy’s YouTube channel or on the company’s Stop.Look.Live safety Web site.  The instructions in the video are demonstrated and explained so they are easy to learn. Key steps to take after an accident include:  Stop and look around to identify safety hazards, including downed or damaged lines, poles or electrical equipment.  Stay in the car unless the vehicle is smoking or on fire.  Signal to others to stay at least 30 feet from the vehicle, keeping pets away as well.  Call 911 immediately.  In the case of smoke or fire, exit by jumping out and clear of the vehicle with your feet together, making sure no part of your body touches the vehicle and ground at the same time.  Shuffle your feet, keeping them as close together as possible, while moving 30 feet from the vehicle to help prevent electrical injury.  More tips on staying safe around electricity and near power lines and equipment are available on FirstEnergy’s “Stop. Look. Live.” safety Web site at firstenergycorp.com/publicsafety.

The zoo says this likely resulted in a fall against the fence and caused her to break her neck.  Zoo staff found Emara unresponsive against the fence. A necropsy revealed that she died quickly, and staff said it was a relief that she didn’t suffer.  Story continues below advertisement  “At 12 years old, Emara was in the prime of her life and had been in excellent health prior to this, so her unexpected departure is being felt deeply by all of us,” said Dr. Doug Whiteside, interim associate director of animal health and welfare at the Wilder Institute/Calgary Zoo.  The zoo said even though the incident seems isolated, they are evaluating the fencing to determine if there are any changes or improvements that can be made to help increase animal safety.  “The health and well-being of all the animals in our care is our top priority. Major life changes such as this not only affect our people but can affect our animal residents as well. We are closely monitoring the zoo’s remaining giraffes, Nabo and Moshi, and so far they are doing well,” added Whiteside.  Emara joined the Calgary Zoo family of animals in 2016 from the San Diego Zoo. She was known for her gentle nature and cautious yet curious personality.  The zoo asks people to keep the staff in their thoughts as they navigate this challenging time of grief. Grief counsellors are being provided for zoo staff. Members of the public are being encouraged to share their well wishes and any fond memories they might have with Emara on social media.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZ2xvYmFsbmV3cy5jYS9uZXdzLzk3Mjk4OTQvZW1hcmEtZ2lyYWZmZS1kZWF0aC1hY2NpZGVudC1jYWxnYXJ5LXpvby_SAVBodHRwczovL2dsb2JhbG5ld3MuY2EvbmV3cy85NzI5ODk0L2VtYXJhLWdpcmFmZmUtZGVhdGgtYWNjaWRlbnQtY2FsZ2FyeS16b28vYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Despite a three-week fight for his life at Sunnybrook Hospital, the young man passed away on May 16. His funeral took place on May 24 at Bay Gardens on the Hamilton Mountain.  The Ministry of Labour, Immigration, Training and Skills Development is currently investigating the incident and has issued corrective orders to both Stelco and John Kenyon Ltd., the sheet metal contractor employing Cabral. Regarding the incident, Shane refrains from making assumptions but finds it difficult to accept that his brother went to work and never returned, saying, ""I know that it shouldn't have happened.""  The ministry confirmed two workers, Cabral and his colleague Sean MacPherson, were burned by steam while repairing steel cladding on a quench tower at Stelco in Nanticoke. The ministry expressed condolences to Gabriel's family, friends, and colleagues.

On Saturday, the actor shared a video to Instagram of his view as he drove down a winding road overlooking Lake Tahoe for what he implied in the caption was a visit with his loved ones.    ""Lake Tahoe / Home #family #lakeday,"" wrote Renner, 52.  The actor also shared two pictures from the trip to his Instagram Story on Sunday. One photo showcased a pair of jet skis placed along the water's edge, while another snapshot appeared to show Renner sitting on a paddle board in the water with his daughter Ava, 10.

Jeremy Renner's Lake Tahoe trip. Jeremy Renner/Instagram  Lake Tahoe, on the border of California and Nevada, is located near Renner's home in the latter state's Washoe County, where the actor's harrowing New Year's Day snowplow accident took place.    More than four months removed from the incident — in which Renner broke over 30 bones and underwent multiple surgeries after his snowplow ran him over while he was helping his nephew get a stuck vehicle out of the snow — he appears to remain on course in his recovery.  On May 19, Renner shared a video of himself lightly jogging on a Boost Microgravity Treadmill that he wrote was his ""first attempt at a light jog"" since the accident.  In addition, a number of recent social-media posts show the actor traveling around Nevada.  Last week, Renner showed some love to his mother Valerie when he shared a photo to his Instagram Story of a newspaper clipping with a picture of himself as a child alongside his mother. The photo appeared to be published in a local Nevada newspaper back when he received his first Oscar nomination for his performance in 2009's The Hurt Locker.  ""This came to my attention ... 🥰 love you mama,"" the Hawkeye actor wrote in a caption above the picture. The newspaper photo itself included a caption that read: ""A young Jeremy Renner is seen with his mother, Valerie Cearley, in this undated family photograph.""  Though the newspaper didn't have a date, the caption went on to refer to the actor as a ""first-time Oscar nominee,"" suggesting it was published prior to the 82nd Academy Awards in 2010. (Renner's performance in The Hurt Locker earned him an Oscar nod for Best Actor.)  Renner has not yet announced any future film roles as he continues to recover from the Jan. 1 snowplow accident, but walked his first red carpet since the incident last month at the Los Angeles premiere of his Disney+ reality series Rennervations.

Following the collision, both father and son had to be airlifted to the hospital and were in critical condition.

Jorja Fox, 17, remains in The Alfred hospital in a serious but stable condition days after her sister Megahn, 14, was killed in the crash alongside teens Joshua Elmes, Lucus Garzoli and Alicia Montebello, who was aged in her 30s.  All four were killed when the car they were in veered off Wannon-Nigretta Falls Road at Bochara, 320km west of Melbourne, and smashed into a tree in the early hours of Saturday morning.  Jorja and Megahn Fox were involved in a shocking crash just outside of Hamilton . Megahn died and Jorja remains in a serious but stable condition  Alicia Montebello (centre) with Megahn and Jorja Fox in March  Chilling footage from inside the car earlier that night shows the vehicle speeding along a narrow country road while rap music blares out.  Police are yet to reveal who was behind the wheel of the speeding car, with detectives hopeful Jorja can assist them with their inquiries when and if she's well enough.  Daily Mail Australia can reveal Jorja shared a close bond with Ms Montebello, who posted an image of her together with the Fox sisters on March 19.  'My best friend Jorja Fox I love you little one,' she posted with a heart emoji.  It is a post that has since earned an angry emoji from Jorja's sister Kayla, who took to social media to pay tribute to her sisters on Monday.  'Rest in peace my precious angel forever in my heart. Life isn't gunna be the same without your goofy personality or that sweet heart,' she wrote on Instagram.  'You were the best little sister I could ask for. I love you so much Meghan.

Images posted to Jorja's Facebook page show her embracing Joshua, who was dressed in his Army cadet uniform.  Other images show the pair enjoying fun times together, with Jorja wearing Joshua's cadet hat.  'U make such a good couple,' one friend posted under the image.  Joshua had been member of the 314 Army Cadet Unit out of Warrnambool with his mate Lucus.  On Sunday, Police Assistant Commissioner Glenn Weir confirmed a witness saw the group's car leaving a local waterfall park about 1am on Saturday.  The wreckage was found by a passer-by at Wannon-Nigretta Road about 9am.  Mr Weir said a crash reconstruction on the narrow strip of road where the accident occurred indicated the car was travelling well in excess of 100km/h.  'To do that speed on that road at that time of day, any time really, is just incomprehensible to me,' he said.  On Tuesday, a police spokesperson said the investigation remained ongoing and could provide no further details.  Teens Joshua Elmes (left) and Lucus Garzoli were both tragically killed in the crash  On Monday, the parents of Joshua told reporters they had warned their son not to get in the car with an unnamed woman who was reportedly driving dangerously only last year.  Matthew Elmes, 46, and Lee Ann Elmes, 41, went to the police but they were told there was 'nothing they could do' without proof.  It is unclear if that was the same woman who was behind the wheel on Saturday.  'I went to the police about it,' Mr Elmes told the Herald Sun.  The Elmes family said they were disillusioned when police officers told them that there was 'nothing they could do' without proof.  Mr Elmes said local teens had been seeking out adrenaline rush activities, including speeding.  Lucus Garzoli had also had been in the army cadets with Joshua Elmes  'If you want an adrenaline rush, it’s probably better to go to a theme park or go skydiving, but don’t get in a car and seek an adrenaline rush. That’s what has been happening with these kids,' he said.  'They’re just pushing the boundaries too much; they’re driving too fast just for the adrenaline rush.'  He said Joshua was prone to making impulsive decisions as a result of an ADHD diagnosis.

Aubrey Scaletta, aged six, was playing with a ratchet strap in the passenger seat of a pickup truck on 17 May when one end of the strap went out the window and wrapped around the drive shaft.  The other end of the strap wrapped around Aubrey's feet, almost pulling her out of the window, the Virginia State Police Association (VSPA) said in a statement. The strap quickly tightened, severing both her feet.  Aubrey was airlifted to a hospital where she underwent a six-hour surgery as the doctors tried to reattach her amputated feet.  “Both feet seem to be receiving good blood flow after being reattached, and as of this morning, doctors have taken off the ventilator,” the VSPA authorities told 10 News  Aubrey is the daughter of state trooper Daniel Scaletta, the police association said, adding that “Aubrey, Aubrey’s sister and Aubrey’s parents are having a real hard time coping with this painful tragedy”.  “The injuries are horrible and painful for all involved,” the VSPA statement said, as it appealed to members of the public to donate towards its emergency relief fund to support the family and help pay for Aubrey’s treatment.  “There are quite a few more surgeries that will need to be completed with reattaching her tendons and skin grafts in the near future,” the VSPA said.  In an update on Facebook posted on Thursday, Aubrey's mother, Lauren Wensel Scaletta, said the child had been taken off the ventilator and was breathing on her own.  She said the family was hopeful that Aubrey would be shifted from the Intensive Care Unit to the paediatric floor over the weekend.  ""This has been both the longest and shortest days of our lives,"" Ms Wensel Scaletta wrote.  ""We have held our breath and moved hour by hour most of the time we have been in the PICU. Everyone has done their very best to take care of our girl and we couldn’t imagine being anywhere else.""  Aubrey's next surgery on her legs for skin grafts is scheduled for 9 June and she will likely be able to leave the hospital by the end of June in a wheelchair with elevated leg support.  After leaving the hospital she will have physical therapy at home. ""Since she is so young it will be done on out patient/ home plan instead of a rehab facility,"" Ms Wensel Scaletta said.  The goal is to have her walking with braces and walkers by Christmas, she said, adding that while ""we realize these things are not guaranteed, it was nice to hear what could be"".

Coach Ray Medrano says on Thursday evening, six of his Zion Hill runners were completing their daily training at Texas Lutheran University, when they quickly acted following a two-car collision at the corner of West Kingsbury Street and Fleming Drive.  Medrano tells the Seguin Daily News, “Without hesitation, the athletes raced towards the scene where two vehicles were damaged beyond repair, and smoking profusely and could go up in flames at a moment’s notice. With one vehicle having no visibility to the interior, the athletes split on all sides of the vehicles to help remove the driver and passenger from an SUV. With the driver clearly in shock, the athletes attempted to make it clear to him what was happening and removed him. The passenger, a woman that was shedding tears did not want to be moved. The athletes helped her understand that her vehicle was up in smoke and may explode at any moment, and she then pleaded for them to help her.”  Upon asking them why they put their own lives at risk to help others, Medrano says the runners simply agreed and stated, “We would have rather had it explode, and we can never run again, then watch them blow up.”  The Zion Hill runners credited by their coach for acting as heroes include Jordan Avalos, Xavier Padron, Brandon Hernandez, Prince Medrano, Ramiro Galvan, Tucker Jones, and Aric Pinguelo.  Medrano says he is grateful that these runners encompass the moral compass of the local running program – Kindness, Integrity, Honesty and Integrity. He says he is proud to be their coach and is proud of the outstanding men they are.  Seguin Police say the accident occurred around 6:15 p.m. Thursday. The conditions of those involved in the accident have not been confirmed.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vc2VndWludG9kYXkuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMzAvYXRobGV0ZXMtcnVuLWludG8tYWN0aW9uLWZvbGxvd2luZy12ZWhpY2xlLWFjY2lkZW50L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Missouri State Highway Patrol (MSHP) has reported several accidents occurring in the Parkland over the last week, including a Friday fatality, and one involving a 17-year-old girl.  The fatality reportedly occurred when a 2019 Ford Mustang, being driven north on Highway E by Jared C. Young, 20, of Hillsboro, pulled into the oncoming lane on a curve to pass a 2010 Ford Explorer which was also being driven north on Highway E, by John W. Schneidewind, 57, of De Soto.  Traveling south on Highway E at the time of Young's attempt to pass on a curve was a 2016 Ford F-450 being driven by Brent A Pogue, 47, of Bonne Terre.  According to the patrol's report, Young swerved to the right but the front of the Ford F-450 hit the driver side of the Ford Mustang. The Mustang ran off the right side of the road and caught fire, while the F-450 ran off the left side of the road.  Young was pronounced dead at Mercy Hospital St. Louis at 11:23 p.m. on Friday.  Pogue's injuries were listed as moderate and he was listed as wearing a seat belt. The patrol said it was unknown whether Young wore a seat belt.  The Ford Explorer was driven from the scene. The Mustang and F-450 were both listed as totaled and taken from the accident scene by Shanks Towing.  On Saturday evening, according to MSHP, a single-vehicle accident resulting in serious injury occurred when a 2005 Triumph Sprint ST driven by William A Bergner, 45, of Bourbon, was heading east on Highway EE, south of Highway 185, when the motorcycle failed to negotiate a left curve, ran off the right side of the road, hit a guardrail and overturned.  The patrol reports Washington County Ambulance took Bergner to Mercy Hospital South to treat serious injuries, although Bergner was wearing a helmet.  Damage to the motorcycle was listed as extensive, and Patriot Towing took away the Triumph.  Another unrelated, single-vehicle accident was reported on Friday afternoon in Franklin County, when a 2013 Dodge Ram 1500, driven north on Highway N south of Tumbleweed Drive by David R. Herring, 60, of Middle Brook, reportedly crossed the center line, ran off the left side of the road, and hit a tree.  MSHP's report states Herring, who was wearing a seat belt, incurred serious injuries and was taken to Mercy Hospital Washington by St. Clair Ambulance. The truck was totaled.  On Friday evening, an unrelated crash occurred in Ste. Genevieve County when a 2021 Ford Ecosport, driven by Marie A. Foster, 22, of Florissant, was heading south on Highway O at Lakewood Drive and attempted to make a left turn on Lakewood Dr., turning into the path of a 2015 GMC Acadia driven north on Highway O by Christina A. Pfaff, 45, of Ste. Genevieve, and hitting the Acadia head-on.  Foster was reportedly taken to an unidentified hospital for treatment of minor injuries. Both drivers were reported as wearing seat belts and both vehicles were removed from the accident secene by Ste. Genevieve Towing.  MSHP Troop E reports that on Highway N north of Middlebrook at 6:42 p.m. May 22, a 2009 Dodge Charger driven by Willie Carter, 19, of Park Hills, crossed the center line and crashed head-on into a 2001 Nissan Frontier driven by Alan Ketcherside, 59, of Bismarck, with passengers Phoenix Dover, 23, of Farmington and Erin Declue, 42, of Bismarck.

The report states that the Dodge Charger and the Nissan Frontier incurred extensive damage in the accident, and the vehicles were towed away by Adams Custom Auto.  Another report by MSHP Troop E shows that on Wednesday, a 2006 Volvo S40 driven by a 17-year-old girl with one passenger, Heath St. Clair, 18, of Fredericktown, was traveling west on Madison County Road 208, seven miles east of Fredericktown, when the Volvo ran off the right side of the road, struck a ditch and flipped.  The minor and St. Clair were taken by ambulance to Madison Medical Center. St. Clair's injuries were listed as moderate, the minor's were listed as minor.

"accident","2017-09-06","Not Discerned","{""Kissimmee"", ""Florida"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-29T18:08:26","Anyone would be shocked if their airbags didn’t deploy in a collision. After all, the NHTSA says airbags prevented the deaths of more than 50,000 people over 30 years.  That means that sometimes the only thing separating a survivable injury from a fatality is an airbag. So, what legal options do people in Kissimmee, FL, have if airbags didn’t deploy in an accident?  Suing the Airbag Manufacturer Isn’t the First Step  The first thought for most people is to sue the airbag manufacturer. That’s certainly possible, but it shouldn’t be the first step.  Suing a manufacturer requires massive investigation, research, and time. But for a car accident victim, it’s critical to receive compensation as quickly as possible to care for basic needs.  So, a lawsuit against the manufacturer is not the quickest way to receive compensation. There are other steps to take.  File a Claim With Your Own Insurance Company  First, car accident victims should file a claim with their insurance company. Why? Shouldn’t they file a claim against the other driver?  Florida is a no-fault state. That means that drivers are responsible for maintaining enough insurance coverage to pay for typical accident damage they suffer. If damage to the automobile is minimal and injuries are minor, a person’s insurance may cover all damages.  File a Claim With the At-Fault Driver’s Insurer  But this is not the case with severe accidents. A person’s insurance would probably only partially cover expenses. How does a victim receive money to pay for the remaining damages?  The accident victim would then file a claim against the at-fault driver. But to be clear, in Florida, victims can only take this second step once their insurance has paid its maximum amount according to the policy.  Be aware that the at-fault driver’s insurer is likely to be reluctant to pay a fair amount. That’s why it’s necessary to have a competent accident attorney help with insurance claims.  Lawsuits Against the Manufacturer When Airbags Didn’t Deploy in an Accident  It’s only after the first two steps that a person might consider a lawsuit against the airbag manufacturer. But suing the maker of the airbag is not as simple as filing insurance claims.  Victims would have to prove that injuries from the accident were worse because the airbag did not deploy.  A skilled product defects lawyer would also have to show negligence on the part of the manufacturer. Is the design faulty, giving the airbag a defect?  Or was it built with inferior materials or in a shoddy manner? Or do the manufacturer’s claims about how well the airbags work not live up to reality?  The manufacturer will counterattack with the full weight of its legal department. So an accident victim must be prepared to fight the legal battle for an extended time.  There May Be Other Responsible Parties  But the airbag manufacturer may not always be at fault. There may be more evidence that the automobile maker installed the airbags incorrectly. Or a dealership or independent mechanic adjusted or altered the airbag in such a way that it no longer functioned properly.  Suing an automaker is even more daunting than taking on the airbag manufacturer. But a car dealership or independent mechanic is likely to offer quicker compensation.  Selecting a Kissimmee Accident Lawyer  Car accident victims in Kissimmee, FL, turn to the Newsome Melton Law Firm to handle their car accident lawsuits. They know that Newsome Law will pursue all options to get the compensation they need and deserve. And that includes any damages from cases where airbags didn’t deploy in an accident.  So don’t delay.

It just so happens the highs of his passion would meet his lowest point in his 17-year life.  “I’m always going to love boating my whole life even though it messed up mine I still have love for it,” said Domb.  Back in January 2021, Hudson was with some friends on the Loxahatchee River in Jupiter.  “I got thrown off the front,” said Domb. “Soon as it happened I just felt something slap my leg. I just saw a mangled leg rise to the top of the water. So, we get to the dock and I told the boys to hand me a ski rope and I started to tie it around my leg.”  It was a skill Hudson learned in a medical class prior to the accident.  “The tourniquet was instrumental in saving his life,” said Dr. Robert Borrego at St. Mary’s Medical Center in West Palm Beach.  Borrego and Dr. Stephen Quinnan were with Hudson every step of the way.  “It was clear that it was going to be a very big undertaking,” said Quinnan.  Hudson woke up on a ventilator and wrote three words.  “I wrote I’m a fighter and I live by that everyday,” said Domb.  Without even the thought of amputation, Hudson had 28 surgeries over several months.  “I knew I had to just keep fighting and keep pushing or else I wouldn’t have made it,” said Domb.  His leg is now reconstructed and he is back out on his boat.  “He’s very strong and has incredible mindset and he’s going to be a big thing,” said Borrego.  In late May 2023 on Stop the Bleed Day, Hudson shared his survival story and lessons on tourniquets.  A newfound passion born from the fight of his life.  “Hopefully this will save many lives,” said Domb.  That class Hudson taught at St. Mary’s was his first, but certainly not his last. He plans to share his story to others along with lessons on tourniquets.

An extensive air and sea search turned up no sign of the missing individuals. The Coast Guard suspended operations on Monday evening.  On the evening of May 28, Kingfisher Charters notified the Coast Guard that one of its boats was overdue, with five people on board.  The boat had last been seen near Cape Edgecumbe. Coast Guard Public Affairs Officer Ian Gray said an air crew found it on Sunday evening partially submerged near Low Island, about 10 miles southwest of Sitka.    “We launched Air Station Sitka along with Air Station Kodiak to conduct search patterns. We discovered a half submerged vessel at around 6:03 p.m. Sunday night, and conducted search efforts to find the five individuals that were missing,” Gray said. “We located one in the water, an older adult male who was not wearing a personal flotation device, and he was deceased.”  The Coast Guard continued their search throughout the next day for the remaining four people who were missing from the boat, with a helicopter crew, a plane from Kodiak, the fast response cutter Douglas Denman, the Sitka Fire Department emergency response vessel, and several good Samaritan vessels on the scene. Over 20 hours, they scoured a wide area. Gray said the search was called off around 9:30 on Monday evening.  “It’s an unfortunate outcome,” Gray said. “The suspended case is always a hard decision to make…But after searching over 820 square [miles] for over 20 hours, those decisions were made, ultimately…our hearts go out to the families of the victims.”  Names of the victims have not been released to the public. An investigation into the accident is ongoing, but Gray says so far it doesn’t look like the vessel ran aground.  “The initial divers that dove on the boat to examine the vessel [said] it didn’t indicate that the vessel struck anything,” Gray said. “There wasn’t a big hole in the hull of the vessel that indicated that they struck anything to make it sink.”    After the search was called off, local marine salvage company Hanson Maritime took over salvage efforts, and was working to remove the boat from the water on Tuesday afternoon. The loss of five people aboard the charter vessel is the worst maritime tragedy in the area since a chartered float plane went down en route from Sitka to Warm Springs Bay in September, 2004. No sign of the plane, its pilot, or its four passengers has ever been found.    ____________________________________________  Initial Reporting:  Update – 10:30 a.m. 5-30-23:  A search for four missing people in the water near Sitka has been suspended (5-29-23).    According to a Coast Guard press release issued Tuesday morning, the search for the missing boaters was called off at 9:30 Monday evening.    “Despite our best efforts and those of several partner agencies, we were not able to find the four remaining individuals, ” said Capt. Darwin Jensen in a statement. “Suspending a search is never an easy decision. We extend our deepest sympathy to the loved ones during this difficult time. Our sincere thanks to community partners and the good Samaritan vessels who rapidly responded to help in the search.”      Original report (5-29-23):    The U.S. Coast Guard is searching for four missing people who were last seen boating near Sitka on Sunday afternoon (5-28-23).    According to a Coast Guard press release, on Sunday evening Kingfisher Charters reported an overdue charter vessel with five people on board.    The boat had last been seen underway near Cape Edgecumbe in Sitka Sound. It was found shortly after 7 p.m. on Sunday, partially submerged near Low Island, about one mile east of Shoals Point, on the southern tip of Kruzof Island.    The Coast Guard recovered one deceased person from the wreckage. As of press time on Monday afternoon, the search for the four missing individuals was ongoing, with several coast guard crews, the Sitka Fire Department and good samaritan vessels aiding in the rescue efforts.

"accident","2021-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Ludhiana"", ""Punjab"", ""India""}","2023-05-29T01:27:00","Poor road infra to blame  The unprecedented rate of population growth in urban areas, fuelled by a high rate of vehicular traffic on roads, is regarded as one of the major causes of the high number of mishaps in the city’s residential areas. It is quite natural that motorisation goes in tandem with urbanisation, yet the rising number of mishaps must also be attributed to the lack of adequate road infrastructure and poor city planning. It has also been observed that the residents are so obsessed with driving rashly that they lose sight of the fact that their reckless driving might endanger many lives, including theirs. The prevention of road accidents is not a difficult task. It only requires proper command of the driver and the upkeep of the vehicle and its machinery. The term ‘control’ refers to both prevention and correction of hazardous conditions and actions. This necessitates the introduction of e-challan mechanism, like in Chandigarh, to deter traffic violations by the offenders.  Novin Christopher  Many systemic lapses on govt’s part  While it is true that a little bit of personal attention and vigilance can help to a great degree to prevent fatal road mishaps, it is also true that there are certain systemic lapses that have an equal share in contributing to such a large number of road accident deaths. Improved road design, the proper maintenance of stretches and ensuring readability of signage are some of the steps that can assist, significantly, in reducing the fatalities in road accidents. Many of the city’s roads have poorly positioned junctions, acute corners, uneven gradients and sudden speed-breakers, among other things. The situation is exacerbated by the improper maintenance of roads. The authorities should, therefore, prioritise road design and maintenance to reduce the fatalities. In addition to this, commuters should be careful for their own safety and obey all traffic rules and guidelines.  Tamanpreet Kaur Khangura  Behavioural change needed in residents  A well-defined method to reduce the fatalities in road mishaps does not exist. While paperwork and compilation of data does help the authorities in identifying and listing the trends observed in the incidents and that helps, to a limited extent, in taking protective measures, it should be known for a fact that this does not help beyond a point. In addition to these administrative decisions, what is needed is a behavioural change in the commuters who often take their own lives and those of others very lightly. What good can government initiatives do when there is the absence of even the recognition that driving is a responsible job and should be done after taking into consideration the impact one’s irresponsible behaviour can have on theirs and others’ lives?  JBS Nanda  Violators must be strictly punished  In order to reduce the number of fatalities in road mishaps, the administration should take the necessary steps immediately. Strict action should be taken against those who violate traffic rules. Everyone must be asked to follow road safety measures religiously. There is a need to create more awareness regarding traffic rules among residents, especially the teenagers. All roads should be well-maintained and without potholes. Regular inspections of roads should be conducted every year or after a fixed period of a few months to ensure that they are properly maintained. If it is found that teenagers are engaged in underage driving, their parents should be fined and booked for negligence.  Adish Sood  Install speedometers at accident ‘blackspots’  According to a latest report by National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), the city of Ludhiana, the industrial hub of the state, holds the top position in terms of fatality rates in road mishaps. It is possible to save precious lives by taking a few precautions. In addition to that, the government should also take steps to improve road infrastructure and strengthen its response mechanisms. The authorities concerned should install speedometers on the prime roads of the city, which have been identified as accident ‘blackspots’ in the survey. The traffic police should make all possible use of modern technology to check violations by commuters. There must be an alert in the form of a siren or hooter which gives a signal to the traffic police and the driver of the latter is overspeeding. At each traffic chowk, there must be an iron bar similar to the bars at toll plazas which should remain closed when there is a red light. The drivers should desist from attending phone calls or eating while driving. Any violators must be strictly punished by the police and authorities concerned.  Dr Mohd Saleem Farooqui  Awareness campaigns can prove effective  The NCRB finding that Ludhiana is ranked number one in the state in terms of fatality rate in road accidents is a worrying statistic. While the onus of improving road infrastructure and taking action against traffic violators lies with the government, the commuters can also take several measures towards road safety by following simple precautions. There should be strict punishment for underage driving because it is usually the teenage drivers, especially on two-wheelers, who are mostly involved in rash driving and endanger both their lives and that of others on the road. Similarly, the authorities should make it a point to act strictly against traffic violators. The authorities should construct separate lanes for scooter riders, cyclists and other slow-moving vehicles. The police should install special nakas at night to check overspeeding and other violations. Swift help should also be available 24X7 to treat victims, if a mishap does take place despite all precautionary measures. Similarly, it is also very significant to take strict action against drunk driving. The vehicles of such commuters must be impounded immediately. Along with these measures, it is also important to intensify the awareness drives, especially among children and teenagers, regarding road safety rules. The schools should organise at least one lecture in a week about traffic rules and the repercussions of their violations.  Farzana Khan  Act strictly against road encroachments  The NCRB has said in its report that the roads in residential areas of the city are more fatal, as the fatality rate of mishaps in these areas has been observed to be the most in 2021. Many factors contribute to problem of road mishaps, right from mismanagement of traffic and undue pressure on drivers to pick passengers and goods ‘earlier’ than their business rivals. Amid the high rates of fatalities, what lacks visibly is an empathy towards the hapless victims. It is only after someone loses their own family member in a mishap that they realise the seriousness of obeying traffic rules. There are many administrative failures as well, that contribute to the deteriorating situation. As the roads and streets are not so wide to accommodate the heavy vehicular movement on them, the municipal authorities should restrict heavy vehicles and buses from traversing on them. ‘One way’ traffic should be made compulsory in the areas where the local movement of vehicles is more. The drivers should be well-trained and the conditions for issuing driving licences should be made stricter to discourage irresponsible commuting. The government should make arrangements for alternative routes like bypasses to tackle the heavy traffic. All stakeholders, including commuters themselves, should shoulder the responsibility of creating safer roads and safe driving. Shopkeepers and vendors should desist from encroaching the roads and streets. Raising awareness on traffic rules is the need of the hour so that the general public is aware about the repercussions of unsafe driving. Teenagers need to be especially taught the dangers.  Sukhdev Sharma  QUESTION  Fleecing of visitors at the parking lots of the city continues unabated. Issuing manual slips, charging more than the prescribed rates and lack of facilities at the lots have become the norm rather than an exception. What should be done to stop this illegal practice?

The film follows Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield going through a series of bizarre and often violent encounters. It has an ensemble cast, including John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Tim Roth, Ving Rhames, Uma Thurman, and The Avengers actor.  While the role of Jules Winnfield brought him prominence, Jackson later shared that he nearly lost his life in a horrific accident during the 1980s.

Jackson’s performance as Jules Winnfield in Pulp Fiction is considered not only one of the best in his career but also one of the most iconic performances in cinema. It turned out to be the big break that every actor waits for in their career. And the Glass actor would later share that none of this would have happened if he had not survived a horrific accident earlier in his life.  During an interview with Vanity Fair, he shared that he was riding the subway in December 1988. As he got off the train he stopped to help out a woman who dropped some of her things. However, he did not realize that while leaning over, his right foot was still in between the subway doors and soon they closed on his ankle.  And shortly after the subway started moving from the station, while his foot was still trapped indoors. He fell backward as the train started moving, and his backpack prevented any head injuries. The actor shared that he believed he would not survive that day as the train entered the tunnel.  Thankfully, “a guy on crutches pulled the emergency cord” before he was smashed into the wall. However, he still suffered a number of critical injuries from the incident and spent ten months on crutches and over a year in physical rehab.

However, the actor had some issues with the film’s portrayal of “heroin abuse,” and was not comfortable with glorifying such things on screen. After he denied the offer, the director had his eyes on Paul Calderon.  However, the Burning Daylight actor was frustrated after the director was late for the audition. Jackson, who was also there to audition for the role, shared that he was also frustrated, but he used it for his audition and was able to nail his audition. Richard Gladstein later shared that he, Lawrence Bender, and Quentin Tarantino all were stunned by his performance.

The Zaporizhzhia plant (pictured), which lies in an area of Russian-occupied southern Ukraine, is Europe's biggest nuclear power station and the area has been repeatedly hit by shelling that both sides blame each other for.  The defence ministry's intelligence directorate said Russian forces would soon shell the plant and then announce a radiation leak. This would force an investigation by international authorities, during which all hostilities would be stopped.  The directorate statement, posted on Telegram, did not provide any proof. It said Russia had disrupted the planned rotation of inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, who are based at the plant.  The Vienna-based IAEA, which frequently posts updates on the plant, has made no mention of any disruption.  Last week witnesses said Russian military forces had been enhancing defensive positions in and around the plant ahead of the counter-offensive.  In October 2022, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged the West to warn Russia not to blow up a dam that would flood a large area. The dam was not destroyed.  Advertisement  In February, Russia said Ukraine was planning to stage a nuclear incident on its territory to pin the blame on Moscow.  Russia has repeatedly accused Kyiv of planning ""false flag"" operations with non-conventional weapons, using biological or radioactive materials. No such attack has materialized.

The man was detained by authorities in Daegu for allegedly breaking aviation security laws. He faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted.  The man, in his 30s, told Daegu police that he had wanted to get out of the plane because he was feeling “suffocated” inside the cabin.    He also had been under stress from being unemployed, authorities said.

"accident","2021-01-03","18:00:00","{""Carmel"", ""Indiana"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-29T02:17:40","SPONSORED CONTENT  NHTSA’s preliminary report shows that over 42,900 people died in road accidents in 2021. Unfortunately, most of these lives were lost in avoidable circumstances.  While no level of caution can guarantee an accident-free drive, you can take some preventive measures to minimize your chances of getting into one.  Avoid Distractions  Distraction ranks high in the leading causes of accidents on American roads. According to statistics, it is responsible for more than 3000 deaths every year.  Distracted driving can be anything that occupies your mind other than operating the vehicle. It can include texting, talking on the phone, smoking, checking your GPS, getting lost in thought, or happenings outside a vehicle.  It is impossible to get rid of all distractions. But, most are avoidable, such as your phone. Switching off your phone is the best option, but you could use your car’s hand-free features if you must use it.  Texting or reading a text is out of the question and among the most dangerous distractions. If your phone is too tempting, switch it off. Also, do your eating and drinking off the road.  Avoid Alcohol  Drunk driving kills approximately 28 people per day on American roads. This translates to approximately 10,000 deaths a year. According to a study by The Zebra, over 17.3 percent of the respondents admitted to having driven after drinks.  The legal limit for blood alcohol content is 0.08 BAC. However, alcohol impairment begins before a person reaches the legal limit. So even when you could pass a sobriety test, it is not worth risking your life and that of other road users, so avoid driving after consuming any amount of alcohol.  Maintain a Safe Speed  Some car engines pack quite some power and can reach very high speeds. If you have such a car, it’s understandable you may want to test its limits, but a busy road is not the place for that. You have to stick to the posted speed limit.  At other times, you may need to speed up when running late. It is best to allow yourself extra time to compensate for unseen eventualities to avoid running late. For example, if you need 30 minutes to drive to get to an appointment, be on the road 45 or 50 minutes prior to your appointment.  If you are driving in bad weather, you have to adjust your speed for the conditions because bad weather can compromise your ability to control your vehicle. “If you cause an accident in bad weather, you can not use weather as an excuse,” says car accident lawyer Christine Bremer of Bremer & Trollop Law Offices.  Maintain a Safe Following Distance and Be Careful With Intersections  Besides speeding, also ensure you maintain a safe following distance. Ideally, you should be a two-second distance from the car in front of you under normal circumstances. In adverse weather, increase your following distance to four to six seconds.  Most accidents occur at intersections. So, you must be extra cautious at intersections, like always stopping at red lights. If there are no lights, ensure that you follow the signage at the intersection and yield if the other driver has the right of way.  If you have the right of way, do not assume that the other driver will yield, so pay close attention to their actions. If they don’t intend to stop, you may need to stop even when you have the right of way. Also, use your turn signals whenever you want to make a turn or change lanes to ensure that the driver in your rear is aware of your intentions.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vYmx1ZXZpcmdpbmlhLnVzLzIwMjMvMDUvd2F5cy10by1hdm9pZC1hdXRvbW9iaWxlLWFjY2lkZW50c9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

It is advisable not to agree to provide a ""recorded statement"" to insurance companies regarding the accident's cause or disclose specifics about your injuries and medical treatment before speaking to a lawyer. Instead, limit the conversation to reporting the accident and initiating the process of addressing the property damage claim. If you decide to hire a personal injury attorney, they then can help communicate relevant information to the insurance company, preventing any misinterpretation or distortion of your statement.  It is essential to know that other insurance companies may be involved in an accident, especially in cases where the at-fault driver was driving someone else's vehicle or was on the job. In such situations, seeking the help of an experienced personal injury attorney can prove crucial. They can identify additional sources of insurance coverage, including additional liability policies or underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage, which can be a significant advantage. Thus, enlisting the services of an experienced personal injury attorney can prove highly beneficial.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdGxhd3Jldmlldy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9nZXQtcm9hZC10by1yZWNvdmVyeS1zb29uZXItd2hhdC10by1kby1hZnRlci1jYXItYWNjaWRlbnTSAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYXRsYXdyZXZpZXcuY29tL2FydGljbGUvZ2V0LXJvYWQtdG8tcmVjb3Zlcnktc29vbmVyLXdoYXQtdG8tZG8tYWZ0ZXItY2FyLWFjY2lkZW50P2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"accident","2021-05-19","Not Discerned","{""Springdale"", ""Arkansas"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-28T11:00:00","Mention Springdale and most folks in Arkansas will think Tyson, JB Hunt, or about the ‘Springdale Five’ on the 2005 state championship football team.  They might even think of the Naturals, the Double-A affiliate of the Kansas City Royals who play at Arvest Ballpark on the west side of town.  In future years, a basketball phenom by the name of Isaiah Sealy may join their ranks. Not since Mitch Mustain in the Class of 2006 has a player been ranked this high nationally (No. 28 on ESPN) and represented the town of Springdale.  Now, that’s not to say there haven’t been impressive basketball players to come through the town.  Just in the last decade, Springdale High has made two state championship game appearances. Its crosstown rival, Springdale Har-Ber, also went to one in 2007 while led by Michael Sanchez, who went on to play for the Razorbacks for four years under both John Pelphrey and Mike Anderson.  Before that, Jeremy Price was an all-state player at Springdale High and helped lead the Bulldogs to the 1998 Class 5A state finals before they lost to Little Rock Parkview.  Now entering his ninth season as the head coach of his alma mater, Price has a rising junior in Sealy that is already grabbing the attention of major college coaches.  Breakout Season for Isaiah Sealy  As a sophomore this past season, Sealy (6-7, 180) burst onto the scene, helping lead the Bulldogs all the way to the 6A state championship game before falling to Jonesboro.  He averaged 14.5 points, 6.3 rebounds and 2.2 assists just in 6A West games. The 6A tournament is where he really shone, however. He had 20 points against Conway in the opener to go with 7 rebounds and 4 assists. Then he scored 21 against Little Rock Central in the quarterfinals.  In the semifinals against Bentonville West, he tallied 16 points and 4 rebounds, while hitting all three of his 3-pointers. Against Jonesboro in the championship game, he had 10 points, but struggled from the field against the Hurricane defense, going just 4 of 14. He also grabbed 5 rebounds.  Sealy, who is a four-star recruit on ESPN and ranked just behind Benton’s Terrion Burgess, just recently got an offer from Eric Musselman and the Razorbacks. He shared the news via Twitter on May 19.  After a great conversation with Coach @EricPMusselman , I’m blessed to receive a D1 offer from the University of Arkansas 🐗🙏🏽 pic.twitter.com/cVQlZIT9XJ — Isaiah Sealy (@isaiah_sealy) May 19, 2023  “It’s a blessing to be offered by Arkansas,” Sealy said in an interview with Best of Arkansas Sports. “I am just going to keep working on my game and I am just going to go wherever I feel like is the best fit for my game.”  Other schools besides Arkansas are in the mix for Sealy’s services, as well. He told BoAS that Texas, Mississippi State, Ole Miss and Oral Roberts contact him a lot.  Isaiah Sealy Scouting Report  In 2021-22, Isaiah Sealy played for the Bulldogs as a freshman. Sure, he was an integral part of the team, but he wasn’t ‘the guy’ yet.  That came this past season.  “He made a big jump,” Jeremy Price said. “His body is changing, so he was able to play with more physicality when he grew a couple of inches and blocked more shots and got more rebounds.  “Doing things without the basketball is where we want him to grow. Moving without the ball, changing the game on the defensive end. Making everyone around him better. That’s what separates people at the next level and we want him to be equipped and prepared to play very high level college basketball and I think he’s moving in that direction.”  Sealy’s father, Oscar, is an assistant for Price and has been coaching his son since childhood. It wasn’t until his son started sprouting up that it became clear he could excel after high school.  “He’s always had talent,” Oscar Sealy said. “But the thought of him playing at the next level came with size. The last couple of years he’s starting to grow and look like a man. The sky’s the limit for Isaiah.”  When asked if Isaiah was one of the best players Price had ever coached, he didn’t hesitate.  “He’s certainly the most talented,” Price said. “And he’s just scratching the surface of what he can become. Usually that kind of question comes after someone has played 3-4 years. If he continues to grow, and we know he’s going to gain muscle and weight, he could definitely end up being one of, if not the best, to ever play here.”  Oscar, who originally grew up in Panama and came to Northwest Arkansas playing basketball at both Ecclesia College and John Brown University before settling down and starting a family, jokingly said that coaching offspring has led to a lot of headaches for him.  “It’s fun, it’s a blessing to be able to coach your son,” Oscar Sealy said. “I don’t want to keep coaching him after high school. I want to enjoy being a parent and be on this journey with him.”  Sealy said he models his game after Boston Celtics All-Star Jayson Tatum, who is trying to lead Boston back from an 0-3 hole in the Eastern Conference Finals of the NBA Playoffs.  “I love watching Jayson Tatum,” Sealy said. “I also watch LaMelo Ball a lot, but if I had to emulate a player it would be Jayson.”  photo credit: Nick Wenger  Overcoming Adversity  In sixth grade, Isaiah Sealy’s basketball dreams – and life – were almost taken away from him.  A serious car accident in Oklahoma left Isaiah, his dad and his cousin all hospitalized. Isaiah’s cousin was in a coma for three weeks.  “We were headed to Dallas to see family for Thanksgiving when Isaiah was in sixth grade,” Oscar Sealy said. “We hit a semi, flipped over a bunch of times. My nephew Khaleel was in a coma for about three weeks. We saw a miracle there. It’s just a reminder that he was meant to be here and everything you do is for a reason and God’s grace got you here.”  Sealy was really banged up with some severe bruising, but recovered and was able to resume basketball activities shortly thereafter.  “It was scary, but I’m just glad that God was watching out for me,” Sealy said.  Car accidents have derailed the careers, or even ended the lives, of many former basketball stars. Malik Sealy, no relation to Isaiah, tragically died in 2000 on the road in Minnesota. Bobby Hurley’s accident in 1993 comes to mind, as he was never the same player in the NBA after that. Even Jay Williams’ motorcycle accident in 2003 put to bed his career with the Chicago Bulls.  Sealy’s perseverance and willingness to excel regardless of circumstances is impressive. Just a few days after the accident, he was discharged from the hospital and getting back on the court was his first priority. That gym rat mentality is what sets apart elite players from just good ones.  Price, the son of a legendary junior high coach and former Arkansas basketball player in the mid 1970s, added that as he and his team embark on the 2023-24 season, the next step for Sealy is becoming the alpha leader that the team needs.  “We kind of joke of him being a team captain, but we want him to become a verbal leader and lead by example,” Price said. “He’s not going to be flying under the radar anymore. He’s going to get everyone’s best defender, every student in the student section is going to be going against him. He’s got a huge target on his back.  “That’s a really good thing, he’ll be going to have to navigate that. He’ll have to make his teammates better basketball players as well, and he’s very capable of doing that. That’s what a lot of college coaches in America want to see. You can shoot, you can drive, you can dish, you can dunk, but where are those leadership qualities? He learns those, he’s going to get to play a lot of basketball in his future.”  Check out some highlights from Isaiah Sealy’s sophomore season at Springdale High:  ***  Check out where Isaiah Sealy ranks on the list of most valuable Arkansas high school athletes in terms of potential NIL:  ***  More coverage of Arkansas basketball and Arkansas recruiting from BoAS…","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlc3RvZmFya2Fuc2Fzc3BvcnRzLmNvbS9hcmthbnNhcy1iYXNrZXRiYWxsLWlzYWlhaC1zZWFseS1hcmthbnNhcy1yZWNydWl0aW5nL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

After lowering Champion to the ground, Thompson and other workers performed CPR until paramedics arrived.  Champion was moderately revived and eventually made a full recovery, living another 35 years.  ""I passed these men working and went on to my assignment,"" Morabito said, adding, ""I took eight pictures at the strike. I thought I'd go back and see if I could find another picture.

But the action behind the scenes can often be more exciting and dramatic than the various performances.  9 America' Got Talent, and its judges, have been plagued by scandals Credit: Getty  9 Aiden Bryant's AGT: All Stars win came with controversy  In February, the most recent season of the show, AGT: All Stars, wrapped up with an epic season finale that left fans furious after aerialist Aiden Bryant's win.  On the finale, Aiden performed high above the competition stage, eventually taking home the top prize.  But fans were flying for jazz saxophonist Avery Dixon.  While Avery was a gracious runner-up, his loyal and dedicated fans on Twitter ripped AGT for allegedly 'rigging' the votes and taking the win away from the saxophone player.  One angry fan wrote: ""Neither of the final two should’ve been up there. Totally RIGGED. Not buying that 'talent has won tonight,' Simon. Not buying any of it.""  Another said: ""#AGTAllstars totally rigged. Total BS.""  A third added: ""So confused about what’s actually going on here with @AGT. Wtf are these results? And the 'super fans' in the audience ‘gasp’ like they didn’t do this nonsense.""  A very blunt fan said: ""Avery was robbed.""  It was hardly the biggest scandal to ever rock the AGT world.  GABRIELLE UNION  9 Gabrielle Union had a well publicized falling out with AGT Credit: Getty  Perhaps the greatest AGT controversy came in 2020 from one of the show's most popular judge.  Actress Gabrielle Union left the NBC competition show the previous year and went on to cite a ""toxic culture” there as the reason for her departure.  She also accused NBC Entertainment Chairman Paul Telegdy of threatening her over plans to whistleblow what she perceived as racism on set.  A statement at the time from NBC sent to The Sun read: ""The allegation that anyone involved in this process threatened Ms. Union is categorically untrue.  ""We took Ms. Union‘s concerns seriously, and engaged an outside investigator who found an overarching culture of diversity on the show.  ""NBCUniversal remains committed to creating an inclusive and supportive working environment where people of all backgrounds are treated with respect.""  Later that year the peacock network reached a settlement with the actress.  NICK CANNON  9 Nick Cannon left the show before he could be fired Credit: Getty  Nick Cannon left America's Got Talent early in 2017 after a much-publicized fallout with NBC.  While he was not technically fired, he says he left the show because he was ""threatened with termination.""  Nick drew the ire of the network after cracking jokes about NBC and AGT on a Showtime comedy special.  ""I honestly believe, once I started doing America’s Got Talent, they took my real n****r card,"" he said during his special Stand Up, Don't Shoot.  Earlier in the special he had said: ""That's what NBC is gonna stand for tonight: ""n*****s better come on, 'cuz n*****s be cussin', so n*****s be careful.  ""Cuz y'all see me on the show. I mean sometimes I wish I could say the stuff that I want to say.  ""But I can't say that. I can't talk like that 'cuz that would mess up the white money. It will.""  JONATHAN GOODWIN  9 Daredevil Jonathan Goodwin was paralyzed after stunt went wrong Credit: Instagram  Extreme star Jonathan Goodwin nearly died in 2021, after he plummeted 40 feet to the ground in a stunt gone terribly wrong.  In video captured from the set, the daredevil artist was suspended in midair and dangling on a rope.  Two cars were suspended on either side of him.  In the stunt, the two cars were supposed to swing toward Jonathan as he was expected to jump up onto the rope and get out of the way.  When the rope suddenly snapped, the performer was slammed between the cars.  The vehicles ended up sandwiching him between them as they immediately burst into flames.  The Henry County Sheriff's Department in Georgia exclusively told The Sun that the stuntman suffered severe injuries in the incident during show rehearsals, and had to be taken to a local hospital.  He would stay there for the next four months.  TYRA BANKS  9 Tyra Banks was accused of abusing a young girl Credit: Getty  A woman referred to as Jane Doe sued the production company behind America’s Got Talent in 2017, claiming that her young daughter was traumatized when then-host Tyra Banks “physically manipulated and verbally abused” the girl.  According to the complaint, the woman said she and her husband were “publicly humiliated” after performing a song they wrote about motherhood that celebrated the young girl’s birth.  It seems not everyone was a fan of the tune.  The suit claimed that during the performance, Tara, ""physically manipulated and verbally abused"" the girl, who was then called Mary Doe.  Tyra ""shook Mary’s shoulder, pulled Mary’s hair back and physically manipulated Mary,"" the complaint continued.  Mary did not stop Tara’s conduct because she was fearful.  Tyra was also accused of insinuating that Mary ""was accidentally conceived, made fun of the performance and ridiculed [the song] in front of Mary, all in front of active cameras that were filming.""  MAUREEN ALLEN  9 The family of a 79-year-old woman claims she died because of injuries caused by crashing her wheelchair while trying to use a disabled access ramp. Credit: Superior Court of California  The family of a 79 year old woman sued America’s Got Talent in 2018 after she supposedly died from injuries she suffered on the set.  Maureen Allen, who was confined to a wheelchair, was volunteering at the Pasadena Convention Center in California on the same day AGT was filming there.  As she tried to maneuver the bulky wheelchair through a sea of television wires and equipment, the chair flipped on its side.  Maureen was left with a broken hip, a blood clot and a stroke.  She died three months after the injury, while on life support.  JUDE ALCALA  9 Sharon Osbourne's former makeup artist sued the show Credit: Getty  Former makeup artist Jude Alcala sued the show in 2013, claiming he broke his leg after accidentally stepping into a hole in the stage and falling six feet.  According to the lawsuit, NBC and were responsible for not posting proper warning signs on the reality show stage.  Jude, who did the makeup for former judge Sharon Osbourne, reportedly broke his femur and damaged his shoulder so badly it required surgery.  He sued for negligence and more, demanding unspecified damages.  TIM POE  9 Tim Poe was caught in a lie  Country Singer Tim Poe gained sympathy and fame after explaining that his stutter was the result of brain damage he suffered from a grenade blast while serving in Afghanistan.  But, that wasn't entirely true.  A spokesman for the National Guard unit that Poe served in released a statement noting: ""Sgt. Poe’s official military records do not indicate that he was injured by a grenade in combat while serving in Afghanistan in 2009.  ""The Minnesota National Guard can also confirm that he was not awarded the Purple Heart Medal for wounds sustained in combat.""  Further doubt was cast after a photo that was said to be of Tim on duty overseas was actually of a different soldier altogether.  ""I would like to take the time to tell the American people how truly sorry I am that they had to endure the incomplete facts,"" Tm later confessed to the New York Post in an email interview. ""I understand how they feel.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvODIxMjk1NS9pbnNpZGUtYWd0LWJpZ2dlc3Qtc2NhbmRhbHMtaW5jbHVkaW5nLW5lYXItZGVhdGgtYWNjaWRlbnQv0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlLXN1bi5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC84MjEyOTU1L2luc2lkZS1hZ3QtYmlnZ2VzdC1zY2FuZGFscy1pbmNsdWRpbmctbmVhci1kZWF0aC1hY2NpZGVudC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"accident","2023-05-29","Not Discerned","{""Waitangi"", ""ChathamIslands"", ""NewZealand""}","2023-05-29T01:45:00","When the National Party’s transport spokesperson, Simeon Brown, questioned the logic of bilingual traffic signs, he seemed to echo his leader Christopher Luxon’s earlier misgivings about the now prevalent use of te reo Māori in government departments.  Genuine concern or political signalling in an election year? After all, Luxon himself has expressed interest in learning te reo, and also encouraged its use when he was CEO of Air New Zealand. He even sought to trademark “Kia Ora” as the title of the airline’s in-flight magazine.  And for his part, Brown has no problem with Māori place names on road signs. His concern is that important messaging about safety or directions should be readily understood. “Signs need to be clear,” he said. “We all speak English, and they should be in English.” Adding more words, he believes, is simply confusing.  It’s important to take Brown at his word, then, with a new selection of proposed bilingual signs now out for public consultation. Given the National Party’s enthusiastic embrace of AI to generate pre-election advertising imagery, one obvious place to start is with ChatGPT, which tells us:  Bilingual traffic signs, which display information in two or more languages, are generally not considered a driver hazard. In fact, bilingual signage is often implemented to improve safety and ensure that drivers of different language backgrounds can understand and follow the traffic regulations.  ChatGPT also suggests that by providing information about speed limits, directions and warnings, bilingual traffic signs “accommodate diverse communities and promote road safety for all drivers”.  Safety and culture  With mounting concern over AI’s potential existential threat to human survival, however, it’s probably best we don’t take the bot’s word for it. Fortunately, government transport agency Waka Kotahi has already examined the use of bilingual traffic signs in 19 countries across the Americas, Asia, Europe and the Middle East. It’s 2021 report states:  The use of bilingual traffic signage is common around the world and considered “standard” in the European Union. Culture, safety and commerce appear to be the primary impetuses behind bilingual signage.  Read more: Bilingual road signs in Aotearoa New Zealand would tell us where we are as a nation  Given Brown’s explicit preference for the use of English, it’s instructive that in the UK itself, the Welsh, Ulster Scots and Scots Gaelic languages appear alongside English on road signs in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.  More to the point, on the basis of the evidence it reviewed, Waka Kotahi concluded that – providing other important design considerations are attended to – bilingual traffic signs can both improve safety and respond to cultural aspirations:  In regions of Aotearoa New Zealand where people of Māori descent are over-represented in vehicle crash statistics, or where they represent a large proportion of the local population, bilingual traffic signage may impart benefits in terms of reducing harm on our road network.  Getty Images  ‘One people’  Politically, however, the problem with a debate over bilingual road signs is that it quickly becomes another skirmish in the culture wars – echoing the common catchcry of those opposed to greater biculturalism in Aotearoa New Zealand: “we are one people”.  It’s a loaded phrase, originally attributed to the Crown’s representative Lieutenant Governor William Hobson, who supposedly said “he iwi tahi tātou” (we are one people) at the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840.  Read more: 'You can’t speak what you can’t hear' – how Māori and Pacific sports stars are helping revitalise vulnerable languages  Whether or not he said any such thing is up for debate. William Colenso, who was at Waitangi on the day and who reported Hobson’s words, thought he had. But Colenso’s account was published 50 years after the events in question (and just nine years before he died aged 89).  Either way, the assertion has since come to be favoured by those to whom the notion of cultural homogeneity appeals. It’s a common response to the increasing public visibility of te ao Māori (the Māori world).  But being “one people” means other things become singular too: one law, one science, one language, one system. In other words, a non-Māori system, the one many of us take for granted as simply the way things are.  Any suggestion that system might incorporate or coexist with aspects of other systems – indeed might benefit from them – tends to come up against the kind of resistance we see to such things as bilingual road signs.  Read more: Putting Aotearoa on the map: New Zealand has changed its name before, why not again?  Fretful sleepers  The discomfort many New Zealanders still feel with the use of te reo Māori in public settings brings to mind Bill Pearson’s famous 1952 essay, Fretful Sleepers.  In it, Pearson reflects on the anxiety that can seep unbidden into the lives of those who would like to live in a “wishfully untroubled world”, but who nonetheless sense things are not quite right out here on the margins of the globe.  Pearson lived in a very different New Zealand. But he had his finger on the same fear and defensiveness that can cause people to fret about the little things (like bilingual signs) when there are so many more consequential things to disrupt our sleep.  Anyway, Simeon Brown and his fellow fretful sleepers appear to be on the wrong side of history. Evidence suggests most New Zealanders would like to see more te reo Māori in their lives, not less. Two-thirds would like te reo taught as a core subject in primary schools, and 56% think “signage should be in both te reo Māori and English”.  If the experience in other parts of the world is anything to go by, bilingual signage will be just another milestone on the road a majority seem happy to be on.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlY29udmVyc2F0aW9uLmNvbS9zbG93LWRvd24tc2ltZW9uLWJyb3duLWJpbGluZ3VhbC10cmFmZmljLXNpZ25zLWFyZW50LWFuLWFjY2lkZW50LXdhaXRpbmctdG8taGFwcGVuLTIwNjU3OdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"accident","2023-12-26","Not Discerned","{""Ulladulla"", ""NewSouthWales"", ""Australia""}","2023-05-29T04:17:00","Former elite NRL coach Daniel Anderson has been overwhelmed by a new initiative by the league community as he faces his toughest test after a freak bodysurfing injury.  Anderson was left a quadriplegic after suffering catastrophic spinal injuries from a bodysurfing accident while he was holidaying on the NSW Central Coast with his family in December.  The 56-year-old was lucky to have survived after being dragged unresponsive from the water and resuscitated by lifeguards and off-duty paramedics, having gone into cardiac arrest.  Roosters coach Trent Robinson and Panthers counterpart Ivan Cleary, along with Eels great Nathan Hindmarsh and league chief executive Andrew Abdo, came together on Monday to launch the Unite for Daniel fundraising initiative.  The league will also work with clubs to fundraise for the champion coach in round 25.  Proceeds will go towards assisting Anderson with purchasing essential equipment, home modifications and ongoing specialist therapy.  Beaming in from the Royal Ryde Rehabilitation Centre, Anderson expressed his gratitude.    ""I am overwhelmed. I am very grateful. Very privileged that I've had some minutes, hours, weeks and months with the guys on the front table. I can't thank the game enough,"" he said.    Anderson recounted how videos and messages of support from people from all corners of the world helped him through the darkest of times.  ""It's going to help me get better again and extract everything I can, and I look forward to going back to work and entering the community again in the next few months,"" he said.  ""This is all part of the pathway for me to get to what will be a new style of life for me.""  Two of Anderson's proteges, Robinson and Hindmarsh, spoke of the immense impact he had on them in their playing careers, but also of how headstrong the former coach was in accepting help following his accident.  ""This is why it's hard for him because, as people, we feel sorry for him, but he doesn't feel sorry for himself,"" Robinson said.    ""He does need our help, but it's hard for him to say, 'I need a helping hand', so that's why we've got to get behind him and help him because he's delivered a lot to rugby league over many generations.""  Cleary recounted how when he was at the twilight of his playing career under Anderson at the Warriors, the coach had transformed New Zealand rugby league after rebuilding a club that had financially collapsed.  ""We went from basically a basket case in 2001, where we were tipped widely to come last; we made the finals and then the following year, made the grand final,"" he said.  Abdo paid tribute to Anderson's exemplary coaching run when he guided the Warriors and Parramatta to grand finals in 2002 and 2009 respectively, and led UK Super League side St Helens to three straight deciders from 2006 to 2008, winning the championship in 2006.  ""You've been a great contributor to the rugby league family, shaping many people's lives, whether they be as players or whether they be as other stakeholders in the game,"" the NRL chief executive said.  ""And while the events that have occurred and unfolded to you are tragic, we want you to know that we're here, and we get to help.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vYXUuc3BvcnRzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9hbmRlcnNvbi1vdmVyd2hlbG1lZC1ucmwtc3VwcG9ydC1hY2NpZGVudC0wNDE3MTE2NTguaHRtbNIBXGh0dHBzOi8vYXUuc3BvcnRzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9hbXBodG1sL2FuZGVyc29uLW92ZXJ3aGVsbWVkLW5ybC1zdXBwb3J0LWFjY2lkZW50LTA0MTcxMTY1OC5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"accident","2016-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-28T15:13:22","[This article by David Shelles first appeared on the Kennesaw State University website, reprinted with permission]  In one moment, Heru Crooks’ life trajectory changed when he was seriously injured in a car crash in 2016.  Crooks, who graduated from high school at age 16, had planned on taking a little time off, maybe a gap year or two to work and pursue some other passions, before going to college to study something in the sciences. But that all changed when the car he was riding in flipped over on Interstate 75 and the impact left him paralyzed from the navel down.  Crooks, now a Kennesaw State University sophomore, says it was that unfortunate turn of events that actually gave him the clarity to see his future as a scientist studying stem cell treatments — the same treatments that helped him recover sooner than his doctors expected after the accident.  Advertisement  Heru Crooks (photo Matt Yung)  “I want to know things, in this case why those treatments worked for me,” he said. “So I figure KSU is the best place for me to find out how they worked, and to discover even better treatments.”  Crooks said he underwent eight surgeries in the three days immediately after the accident, and then endured several months of intense physical therapy at Atlanta’s Shepherd Center, a world-renowned rehabilitation center. He was told that he was paralyzed and would spend the rest of his life using a wheelchair.  “I’ve always had an affinity toward science, life, the universe, but definitely my incident sparked supreme interest in the sciences,” he said. “Of course, from having this particular injury, my interest in the human nervous system and neurology just expanded greatly. Everything that could offer any idea about the human nervous system just sparked my interest.”  Crooks said his father was his biggest champion. Three months after the accident, the two went to Panama for one course of syncopal stem cell therapy, which incorporates stem cells from discarded umbilical cords as well as cells from the patient’s own bone marrow. Crooks said he regained some ability to control parts of his body, as well as lessened dependence on medication, through these therapies.  Later, they traveled to India for a more aggressive course of stem cell treatments, this one focused on regenerating nerves in the spinal cord. That helped Crooks get back on his feet. He said he walked a short distance with a walker and leg braces within two years of the accident, which impressed his team of doctors.  All the while, Crooks said he read anything and everything on the various treatments and therapies he experienced. Four years after the accident, he had a greater desire to learn, and decided it was time to go to college. He chose Kennesaw State for its proximity to his family in Tucker, Ga. and its affordability, but he soon discovered a campus with myriad opportunities for a curious future scientist.  Perhaps the most important opportunity was the one he found with professor of biology Martin Hudson, whose research focuses on nervous system formation and disorders. Crooks said his interest in biotechnology best reflected Hudson’s research into neurologic pathology.  “I want to be part of that new biotechnology wave and help cure myself and help cure others,” Crooks said. “The classes I took initially were good, but I wanted something more in-depth. Dr. Hudson’s lab caught my eye because his research focused on neuroscience that took in science and genetics, which were my two favorite things, so it just seemed like a match.”  Hudson researches how the nervous system forms and the pathologies that take hold when the process goes awry, by studying a transparent microscopic worm called a nematode. He said bright, curious students join his laboratory group yearly, but few with the desire to research deep scientific topics on their own time as Crooks does.  “He’s got a story, but the most important thing to me is he wants to be a scientist, and I can help train him inclusively,” Hudson said. “Finding someone that is instantly engaged is uncommon, like he’s taking notes and filing things away before you even prompt him to do so—an innate curiosity. He’s been a major asset to our research team.”  Photos by Matt Yung  Hudson added a lower table to one of the lab stations and worked with his equipment supplier to adapt a microscope to Crooks’ eye level. Crooks said he appreciated Hudson’s efforts and has responded by diving headlong into undergraduate research.  Crooks will spend the summer doing research through the Undergraduate Research Training Initiative for Student Enhancement (U-RISE) program, funded through the National Institutes of Health and dedicated to uplifting undergraduate researchers from underserved communities interested in pursuing doctoral degrees in biomedical sciences. When he earns his bachelor’s in biochemistry in 2025, Crooks plans to do just that. He said he wants to be an asset to the scientific world at large.  “There is increasing potential in regenerative biomedical science, and I want to advance this field in a transformative way,” he said. “A crazy turn of events has turned into a blessing; my accident was a catalyst for my desire to learn and develop. I’m enthused and thankful that KSU is the place for me to explore my love for science.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vY29iYmNvdW50eWNvdXJpZXIuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvYWNjaWRlbnQtc3B1cnMta2VubmVzYXctc3RhdGUtc3R1ZGVudC10by1yZXNlYXJjaC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

As she explains, ""Cars take us places, they move forward, so they usually represent something in progress and moving forward, whether that's a relationship, career project, or a health goal.""  So for the car to crash, then, represents a sudden ending—or perhaps an extended pause—on whatever that situation is in your real life. But it can also relate to literal accidents or mistakes you've made, with Loewenberg noting that if you ""wrecked"" something in your life, it would make sense to dream of wrecking your car.  And sometimes, she adds, our dreams can be a reflection of our emotional state as well. In some cases, car crash dreams can also be connected to an energetic or emotional ""crash"" you're feeling in your life (i.e. feeling burned out or exhausted).  That said, here's a deeper dive into more specific scenarios, depending on what exactly happened in your dream.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbmRib2R5Z3JlZW4uY29tL2FydGljbGVzL2RyZWFtLWFib3V0LWNhci1hY2NpZGVudHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Megahn Fox, 14, was the youngest of the four to have perished in the crash.  Her sister, Kayla Dean, took to social media to pay tribute to her.  'Rest in peace my precious angel forever in my heart. Life isn't gunna be the same without your goofy personality or that sweet heart,' she wrote on Instagram.  Meghan Fox, 14, was killed in the horror crash on Saturday  Lucus Garzoli had been an Army cadet. He died tragically on Saturday in a horrific car wreck  Lucus Garzoli's Facebook intro urged people to live their life to the fullest  Joshua Elmes (pictured) was killed alongside Lucas Garzoli. He too is believed to have been an Army cadet  Investigators removed the wreckage of the car on a truck (pictured) at around 12pm on Sunday  'You were the best little sister I could ask for. I love you so much Meghan. My heart aches so much knowing your not right behind me.'  Kayla also reached out to the families of those who died alongside her sister on Saturday.  'To all the families who were affected by this terrible situation my heart goes out to you, it's definitely not easy I know Josh, Lucas and Meghan touched so many lives and they were loved by all,' she wrote.  'I want to thank everyone for the supportive messages towards myself and our family. This is no goodbye Meegs, it's just see you later. Your always gunna be my little sister.'  Lucus Garzoli was on Monday identified as the third victim of the crash, which happened when the car he was in veered off Wannon-Nigretta Falls Road at Bochara, 320km west of Melbourne and smashed into a tree in the early hours of Saturday morning.  'You only live once so make it a good f**king life,' Lucus posted as his introduction motto on Facebook.  Lucus had been a proud member of the 314 Army Cadet Unit out of Warrnambool with his mate Joshua Elmes, who was also tragically killed in the crash.  The teenager had been a car enthusiast, with photos of hotted-up vehicles posted to his social media page.  He had proudly marched in Warrnambool with the cadets on Anzac Day just last month.  It remains unclear who was behind the wheel of the Toyota Corolla when it crashed.  A mother in her 30s - Alicia Montebello - and three teens were killed. All were from the town of Hamilton, Victoria, located 11km from the crash site.  A 17-year-old girl - the sole survivor of the crash - was taken to hospital with critical injuries to her upper body.  Victoria Police Assistant Commissioner Glenn Weir said on Monday an examination of the crash reconstruction revealed the car was travelling 'well in excess of 100km/h'.  'To do that speed on that road at that time of day, any time really, is just incomprehensible to me,' Mr Weir told ABC radio.  'This is something we're seeing play out in a number of the serious injury collisions and fatalities that we've seen recently – people not driving to the conditions.'  He further revealed police believe a number of passengers weren't wearing seat belts, with specialised officers still trying to determine who was driving.  It is hoped the surviving teenager in hospital is able to help police put together what happened.

Matthew Elmes acknowledged his son's death by sharing a tribute that the teen had posted for his father's birthday just two weeks ago on May 15.  'Happy birthday to the most amazing dad. I love you and hope you have an awesome day. You deserve it,' Joshua wrote alongside a series of photos.  The Facebook post featured selfies of father and son trying on different camera filters, photos of Joshua as a baby and a family hike with his younger siblings.  Mr Elmes said despite trying to be a good dad, he felt like he had 'failed' Josh.  'I'm holding onto a post from my son,' the grief-stricken father commented.  'I tried to be a good Dad for you Josh... I feel like I have failed you though... I will see you again some day when the silver cord is severed, and the golden bowl is broken; when the pitcher is shattered at the spring, and the wheel broken at the well.'  In his letter to parents the principal advised that an assembly would be held on Monday morning to support the students.  'I have spoken to the Elmes family who have asked that this be communicated with the school community,' the principal said.  'Our heartfelt sympathy goes out to Josh's family, including Josh's brother, year 7 student Aaron.'  Alicia Montebello, a mother in her 30s, was also identified as a crash victim on Sunday  Bochara, with a population of less than a hundred people, is located about three-and-a-half hours west of Melbourne  Crash victim Alicia Montebello was a Hamilton mother in her 30s.  Her grieving brother Jaryd posted a moving tribute on Sunday to his 'beautiful sister'.  'Rest in peace, my beautiful sister taken way to soon you were loved very much. Forever with us love you sis.'  Emergency services managed to tow the car from the scene at midday on Sunday, which has its roof caved in and bonnet crumpled by the impact.  Messages were seen written on the inside of the Toyota Corolla, including the tragic words 'drive safe' and 'love people, help people'.  Police are hoping CCTV footage may shed light on what time the accident happened and how long it was before the crash was spotted and the alarm raised.  Police believe the driver of the car lost control before the vehicle crashed into a tree.  'Two females and two males died at the scene,' a Victoria Police statement read.  'Another female has been taken to hospital with serious injuries.'  Three teenage school friends are dead and another is fighting for life after a horror smash on a road in regional Victoria  The red Toyota Corolla had messages written on its the seats - including the tragic words 'drive safe' and 'love people, help people' (pictured)  Students were also seen leaving bouquets of flowers and other tributes at Hamilton's Baimbridge College, where some of the victims attended  Victoria Police Sergeant Ryan Nelson said the community would be devastated by the multiple deaths.  'Hamilton is a very close-knit community, and there's five people involved in this and all their families and all their friends,' he said.  'It's going to hit the town really hard.'  According to the 2021 census, 10,346 people live in Hamilton and 84 in Bochara.  Southern Grampians Shire Mayor David Robertson described the crash as a parent's worst nightmare.  'This is horrific right across the community,' he said. 'The whole community will feel the impact of this for a long time to come.'  Mr Robertson said the teenagers 'would be known right across the town'.  'Even if they don't know the children, they would know the parents or the grandparents or their brother or sisters.'  The tragedy happened on Wannon-Nigretta Falls Road in country Victoria (pictured)  Emergency services (pictured) were called to the scene at Bochara, three-and-a-half hours west of Melbourne, shortly after 9.30am on Saturday morning  The mayor said the crash happened 'somewhere between 4am and 9.30am on Saturday morning on a lonely bit of road'.  He said safety is a big issue in the area due to the condition of the roads and wildlife.  On Sunday morning, children and families attended a confirmation service at Saint Mary's Catholic Church where a moment of silence was held for those affected.  Students were also seen leaving bouquets of flowers and other tributes at Hamilton's Baimbridge College, where some of the victims attended.  Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said his thoughts were with the family and friends of the victims.  'This will be an incredibly difficult time for those families and friends, and people who love those who have been caught up in this, and we send our best wishes in what will be an incredibly challenging time,' he said.  'People should be assured there will be a full investigation … so we can try and understand what's happened here.'

The first accident happened just before 7 p.m. Saturday near Meridian, according to a news release from Idaho State Police.  A 20-year-old Caldwell man was driving east on the interstate at a “high rate of speed” on a Kawasaki motorcycle, said police. At milepost 41, just west of Ten Mile Road, the motorcycle hit the barrier on the right side of the interstate.  “The driver came to rest on the roadway,” said the news release.  The riderless motorcycle then ran into a Chevrolet Tahoe, which was being driven by a 44-year-old female from Las Vegas, Nevada.  Although he was wearing a helmet, the driver of the Kawasaki died at the scene.  Idaho State Police report that the two right lanes if I-84 were blocked for about two-and-a-half hours.  The other accident also happened on I-84, this time near milepost 43 in Ada County. The time of the accident was not reported.  An 18-year-old male was heading east on a Kawasaki ZX636 motorcycle when he rear-ended a Toyota Camry.  “The driver came to rest in the roadway,” a news release about the accident said.  The driver of the motorcycle was wearing a helmet. He was transported by ground ambulance to the hospital.  The 51-year-old driver of the Camry, a man from Fruitland, was apparently unharmed.  “The left two eastbound lanes of travel were blocked for approximately one hour,” said police.  Both accidents are still being investigated by Idaho State Police.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhc3RpZGFob25ld3MuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvc3BlZWQtYS1mYWN0b3ItaW4tdHdvLXNlcGFyYXRlLW1vdG9yY3ljbGUtYWNjaWRlbnRzLW9uZS1vZi10aGVtLWZhdGFsL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

A similar mishap took place at the north golf course of Mill Creek Metro Park recently.  In an unfortunate twist of fate, a golfer died at the Mill Creek Metro Park. On Saturday morning emergency services were contacted at around 10:00 a.m. to report a tragic incident including one’s death.

The Mahoning County Coroner’s Office and multiple ambulances were present on the scene.  Jamie Yohman, the Mill Creek community engagement Director released a statement regarding the sad incident saying, “An unfortunate incident occurred resulting in the fatality of a golfer. We are not releasing any further information to respect the family’s privacy as they notify family members.” Unfortunately, there have been many more similar incidents where someone from the golf community met a fatal end.  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad  The fatal accident of a golf cart driver  A golf cart may seem like a safe, fun, and easy way to get around, but it has also brought about several disastrous accidents. The lack of safety measures in the vehicle including no doors and windows places it quite high in the risk spectrum. That’s what happened on Holly Springs Road in South Carolina.  A golf cart was crashed by a Nissan sedan just last month, while attempting to make a left turn. The crash was lethal as the driver of the golf cart was pronounced dead a couple of days later. The Nissan driver didn’t suffer any injuries due to the accident and no charges were filed against him.

The unofficial start of Oklahoma’s outdoor season has proven to be a dangerous weekend for lake-goers enjoying outdoor activities; however, authorities believe these tragedies were preventable.  RELATED |  Officials spent the week leading up to it giving warnings and safety tips for boating and off-roading, but almost every incident authorities reported over the weekend was a result of defying expert advice.  Eric Petersen, 54, took his ATV from Missouri to the trails near Pensacola Dam on Grand Lake.  GRDA said he was riding up a hill Friday evening when his vehicle overturned in a deadly accident.  “Oklahoma finished fourth in the country in total deaths in side-by-sides and ATVs last year,” said Mike Klumpp, the ATV safety coordinator for Bethany Children’s Hospital.  RELATED |  Petersen was wearing a helmet at the time of the accident, but many do not.  “Every day in Oklahoma, somebody goes to the emergency room, or a trauma center, or a health facility, with an injury from an ATV crash or a side-by-side crash,” said Klumpp.  The next tragedy occurred early Saturday afternoon in Grand Lake’s Honey Creek region, when an unidentified 87-year-old man stepped off a boat, missed the dock, and drowned.  “If you’re going to be around the water, it’s great to wear your life jacket,” said Hutch Todd, Keystone Lake manager. “And most people that end up drowning never intended on being in the water. So even if you know how to swim, most of the time, that’s not a good enough excuse.”  Shortly after the drowning, a single-boat collision on Lake Hudson sent two women to the hospital.  “The most commonly-reported accident is a vessel versus vessel accident,” said Todd. “Now that’s reported, surely there’s more vessel versus fixed-object, but those don’t get reported all the time.”  At about the same time as the collision, another incident happened on Lake Eufaula.  The Oklahoma Highway Patrol said a drunk 68-year-old man intentionally rammed a Department of Wildlife boat.  RELATED |  The man had seven passengers aboard his own boat, including three children, fortunately, no one was injured.  “Boating and alcohol are never a good mix,” said Todd. “Similar to operating a vehicle, it is a violation and can be enforced by the Oklahoma Highway Patrol for boating under the influence.”  Less than an hour later, a boat exploded near the Check-In Bay region of Grand Lake, where five people, including a 5-year-old, were injured.  RELATED |  The GRDA has not yet determined the cause of the explosion; however, Todd said explosions are most likely to happen when refueling.  “It is always good practice to run the blower that’s equipped on the vessel for four minutes and do a sniff test,” said Todd. “If you smell any fumes in the engine compartment, keep running that blower. If you don’t, you could have an explosion, and we don’t want that.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8va3R1bC5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9tdWx0aXBsZS1wZW9wbGUtaW5qdXJlZC1raWxsZWQtaW4tb2tsYWhvbWEtbGFrZS1hY2NpZGVudHMtb3Zlci1ob2xpZGF5LXdlZWtlbmTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(KMOV) - One person is dead, and another woman is injured from boating accidents on Missouri waterways this Memorial Day weekend.  According to the Missouri Highway Patrol, 80-year-old Thomas Crain of Chadwick, MO, was killed Thursday on Table Rock Lake during a boating accident. A woman was injured Thursday on the Lake of the Ozarks when she was thrown from a boat.  Memorial Day Weekend is the official kick-off of summer, and officials urge everyone to take precautions on the water.  “Wear your life jacket. That’s the number one thing for safety and survival,” said Jeff Fisher, manager and boat captain for Freedom Boat Club in St. Charles.  The club boasts 380 locations around the world, including locations on the Mississippi River and Lake of the Ozarks.  They require a three-hour training course to ensure members understand how to be safe and confident on the water.  Boating on the lake versus the river will bring different safety precautions.  “Everything’s changing on a river, so from day to day week to week, if you’re unaware of that, you can run yourself into harm’s way,” said Fisher.  Kids under seven are required to wear a life jacket; others need to ensure they are available and accessible.  Don’t drink and operate a boat and always make sure you know the rules of the waterways.  The Missouri State Highway Patrol offers guidelines as well as safety education classes on the MSHP website.

Local residents said the pace of the construction work quickened only after the tragedy. They pointed out that in the absence of a permanent bus shelter, people stood on the roadside at many undesignated places waiting for buses and autorickshaws.  A source from the area said, “A few people were standing near the vend where one of the victims, Rajvati Devi, was selling husked corn. Others were waiting for the bus when the speeding red Beetle car ran them over on May 17. They were all rushed to PGI where doctors declared one woman dead. Later, two others succumbed to injuries.”  Local councillor Ram Chander Yadav said, “Construction work for the bus queue shelter was started after the road accident. I have been urging the UT administration to remove street vendors from the roadsides. They should only be allowed to sit at a distance of at least five feet from the main road. All our demands went unheard, but now the authorities have reacted.”  When contacted, Union territory chief engineer C B Ojha maintained that there is no link between the ongoing construction work of the bus shelter and the recent road accident. “The construction of the bus queue shelter on the Dhanas-Sarangpur road was finalised four months ago. It got delayed as the officials concerned were determining the exact location of the queue shelter. The construction work began prior to the road tragedy. The shelter will be ready shortly.”  National-level shooter Parambir Singh Dhola, 19, who was driving the Beetle, was arrested on May 20.

This weekend traditionally sees the highest rates for auto and water-related accidents.  Boaters and beach-goers began arriving early Saturday on waterways such as Lake Gladewater and Lake Hawkins, in the first big weekend of late-spring, early-summer fun.  “The lakes are healthy. We have lots of families out enjoying the water. It’s national water safety week,” said Gregg County Game Warden Todd Long.  Statistically, Memorial Day weekend has the most traffic accident reports, among travel holidays in the U.S. It also rates among the top weekends for water-related accidents in Texas.  “We’re going to be out there, full patrol, checking life jackets, water safety items on the boats,” Long said.  Alcohol and impaired boating contributes to a large percentage of the accidents.  “Boating while intoxicated is the same offense as driving while intoxicated. We’ll be doing sobriety checks throughout the week and throughout the summer,” the game warden said.  Most accidents can be prevented by observing some simple rules.  “Be familiar with your water safety equipment, including your throw cushion. Know the lake. Be familiar with the buoy systems. Be familiar with the weather. First and foremost is wear that life jacket. State law requires children under 13 to have it on at all times,” Todd said.  A large percentage of all boating fatalities are drownings, and most of those are cases where a life jacket was not worn.  “The last thing we want this holiday weekend is to come looking for someone at the bottom of the lake,” said Long.  Long recommends everyone operating a boat take a boaters’ safety course, and he advises anyone getting in the water to take swimming lessons.  Copyright 2023 KLTV.

Wolfe County Search and Rescue Chief, John May said they’ve been averaging about 80 rescue missions a year. He said that number has definitely increased within the past five years.  Their team is full of experienced hikers, but before they head out they recommend letting someone know where you are and where you plan to go.  “I’ll always call my wife, and say ‘hey I’m on Rock Bridge Trail. I should be out by three, but if you haven’t heard from me by four it’s time to call someone,” May said.  On Friday, a 46-year-old Lexington woman was injured on rugged trail. Fortunately, their team responded quickly.  “Just because of the sheer volume, we average about 1.5 per week. Most of them take hours. The one last night we started at 6 pm and finished about 10:30 pm,” May said.  One day before that rescue, their moving water rescue and dive team were dispatched to a drowning on Wolfe Lake.  “Water temperatures are still cool, which can set in cramps if you’re trying to swim like that,” May said. “We encourage people, as boating and swimming season starts to ramp up, if you’re on a lake, and if you’re not a very good swimmer, have some sort of floatation device with you, and never try to cross a large body of water without something.”  He said cell phone service at Red River Gorge can be difficult to get, but if you ever are in danger, he urges people to call 911.

"accident","2021-04-12","10:00:00","{""MbujiMayi"", ""KasaiOriental"", ""DemocraticRepublicCongo""}","2023-05-27T14:58:02","By Prisca Sam-Duru  Anyone who tells you that social media is not the highest invader of people’s privacy, isn’t being entirely truthful.  This trending means of communication broke the news of the Minister of Primary, Secondary and Technical Education (EPST) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) Tony Mwaba Kazadi, impregnating his Deputy Minister, Aminata Namasia few days ago; of course, without their permission.  Even as the world awaits the ‘verdict’ from DRC President, the story continues to trend across the media.  Kazadi and Namasia’s love or lust affair, done in the dark has become a subject for global consumption; courtesy of social media.  In those good old days, such acts of infidelity only ended up as family feud usually settled thereafter.  The elegant Namasia was appointed the National Deputy Minister of Primary, Secondary and Technical Education in the Democratic Republic Of Congo under Jean-Michel Sama Lukonde’s cabinet on April 12, 2021. And as reported by The Heritage Times, a DRC journalist, Lungila John took to Twitter to reveal the affair between both officials that led to the deputy education minister’s pregnancy.  Reports also revealed that Kazadi and Namasia, who are married, began their love affairs while working together in the DRC education ministry. So it wasn’t something that began prior to their working together.  Perhaps, it was the revelation by the journalist that forced Kazadi to confess that he actually impregnated his Deputy Minister, Namasia, although he described it as “accidental.”  Since the news broke, the two government officials have come under heavy criticism from citizens of their country and beyond, who are condemning them for such display of the height of immorality. Those in this camp think both were not disciplined and as such, are a disgrace to their office. Their critics believe the affair could affect certain decisions they take in the ministry.  “DRC is a country of shame. Namasia has no education to give to any young lady in the country,” says Archy Lema, a citizen of DRC and Twitter user.  There are others who also think there is nothing honourable and excellent in the minister and his deputy due to their misconduct. They believe they’ve failed as public figures with millions looking up to them as role models.  The fact is that these are two adults. The woman was not raped. It really doesn’t matter where people meet or who one should be intimate with. The problem here is that report says they have their spouses at home. And so, that makes it morally wrong.  “Two of them are not disciplined,” Odewoye Kayode declares. Kayode could be right. These are married individuals and should have been disciplined enough to keep their relationship within the confines of their jobs.  It sounds like it was easy for them to take their affair further as to want to start another family. Even with an elated office of the minister, Kazadi gets involved in an act of infidelity that has birthed fruit, who knows how many women he would have accidentally put in the family way, without the social media picking them up, if he wasn’t a public office holder. Anyway, that’s by the way.  But then, some things, do not really add up here. How did the Journalist who broke the news know that the pregnancy does not belong to the woman’s husband, since she is married? And when Namasia found out she had taken in, why didn’t she abort the pregnancy to conceal her affair with her boss? If she lacked the moral to stay away from infidelity, what stopped her from getting rid of a pregnancy conceived in sin? Could it be she is weary of her marriage such that she found solace in her boss? A lot of questions begging for answers! As her affair with her boss came to the open, Namasia was quoted as saying her privacy should be respected. “Beyond my official and public duties, I have a life that must be respected by all. A right guaranteed to all Congolese by our Constitution. Tarnishing my image should not be tolerated habit. Indeed, it could harm not only my commitments, but also the image of my married male colleagues and their homes…”, she wrote on Twitter.  Someone would say at this point, she’s got some nerves. She is beautiful; very, and bold too.  As a result, most Netizens think she may have been the one who charmed her boss with her beauty.  Seriously, the deputy minister’s beauty has been largely blamed by Netizens who believe it will be hard for a man to work with such a damsel without lusting after her. They however refuted the minister’s claim that it was accidental, since both were said to have been intimate for a long time. Truly, describing Namasia’s pregnancy as accidental sounds like an excuse from an amateur; very funny actually.  And so, rather than take the matter seriously, jokes are being made out of Kazadi’s choice of words while owing up to the act of infidelity.  “What a sweet way to get accident” says Godswill Charles.  “Who will not impregnate such a beauty if given the opportunity,” says Vincent Ugwu in response.  Mislo Kawamba wrote, “She is cute, damn! the dude fell hard.”  Club Oya Ebuha wrote, “Accidental discharge that killed no one but ended in producing another in a shameful manner.”  ‘It’s accidental’ says Congolese education minister after impregnating deputy, Béèní!!!

On May 21, the Coral Springs Police Department arrived at a car accident scene with reported injuries to young children near West Atlantic Boulevard and Coral Springs Drive.  Upon arrival, records show that officers encountered first responders needing police assistance due to the erratic behavior of one of the drivers, who, at the time, was allegedly the one at fault.  The driver, later identified as Miazoti Ann White, 38, of Coral Springs, was described as acting belligerent and cursing at the Coral Springs-Parkland Fire personnel.  Upon approaching White, CSPD observed her to be emotionally distraught, transitioning from cursing to uncontrollable crying.  As officers looked further into her vehicle and its surroundings, it was discovered that she had seven small children with her, all of whom were also distressed, and one child was bleeding from their forehead.  According to the CSPD incident report, it was discovered that there were no child safety seats or restraints in the car, despite there being seven young children between the ages of three and six.  The arrest report indicates that upon further investigation of the crash, it was revealed that White had crossed over a raised curbed median into oncoming traffic, resulting in a collision with another vehicle. The report does not indicate the status or condition of the other vehicle involved in the crash.  According to CSPD, the smell of alcohol on White’s breath became increasingly apparent during their conversations with her, and she exhibited slurred speech and bloodshot watery eyes and displayed highly emotional and uncooperative behavior towards the first responders.  Officers at the scene reported the presence of an alcoholic beverage odor emanating from the defendant, and a glass “Corona” beer bottle was found in the center console of her vehicle.  Considering the totality of the circumstances, a Special Victims Unit Detective was called to the scene to investigate the Child Neglect aspect of the case. However, White became even more uncooperative during the investigation and refused to provide any information to the detective.  The arrest report shows that when officers attempted to escort White to a patrol car, she intentionally kicked multiple detectives and officers trying to restrain her and take her into custody.  White continued to display disrespectful and racially offensive behavior toward the officers, and despite being read the Implied Consent Warning, which outlines the legal requirement to provide a breath sample, White repeatedly yelled profanities and racial slurs, ultimately refusing to cooperate, according to the report.  It was later revealed White’s Florida Driver’s License was already suspended due to a previous DUI offense, making this her third subsequent offense. White also has a history of violating child restraint laws and traffic violations in Coral Springs, according to the report.  White was later transported to the Broward County Main Jail  Send Your News to Coral Springs #1 Award-Winning News Site Here.

Spc. Jayson Reed Haven, 20, of Aiken, South Carolina, died from a rollover accident that occurred in a non-combat situation on Thursday at Camp Buehring in the northwestern desert of Kuwait, about 20 miles from the southern border of Iraq.  The fatal incident remains under investigation, according to a press release from the U.S. Department of Defense. Further details were not immediately available.  The news of Haven's death came just days before Memorial Day, a federal holiday for honoring and mourning those who have died while serving in the United States Armed Forces.  ""There are no words that can adequately express how deeply saddened I am at the loss of one of our own,"" Maj. Gen. Van McCarty told Haven's hometown newspaper, the Aiken Standard. ""SPC Jayson R. Haven was more than just a member of the South Carolina National Guard; he was family.""  Haven, a machine gunner, had received multiple medals and awards during his service with the South Carolina National Guard. He was assigned to Company B, 1st Battalion, 118th Infantry Regiment, 218th Maneuver Enhancement Brigade, based in Charleston. He initially joined the U.S. Army in 2020, according to the Aiken Standard.  Haven was deployed to Kuwait to support Operation Spartan Shield, an effort to strengthen U.S. defensive relationships throughout Southwest Asia, according to the Army.  Vehicle accidents involving rollovers are a leading cause of death for the U.S. military.  While rollovers only account for a quarter of vehicle accidents, they contribute to 63% of accidents involving a death between 2010 and 2019, according to a 2021 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office.  That same report found that the military did not take sufficient action during that time frame to reduce the often preventable accidents, which accounted for 123 deaths for the Army and Marines between 2010 and 2019.

Matthew Meredith is currently hospitalized at Providence Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills with head trauma, broken ribs, and pelvis, according to his older sister Valeria Enriquez. She says her family fears Meredith could suffer permanent brain damage and become paralyzed because his pelvic fractures are close to the spine.  His mother, Jacqueline, has not left his side. She said her son is expected to require several surgeries and while she is wrought with worry, it was important to her to express her gratitude to the doctors. Matthew has had swelling of the brain and has been in a coma, but she is grateful that the hospital medical team has successfully lessened the blood that was pressuring the vital organ.  According to Enriquez, Meredith was driving on Hubbard to pick up his younger sister at John F. Kennedy High School in Granada Hills after 3:30 p.m. However, the brother never made it to the campus. “I was working when I received a phone call around 4 o’clock that my brother had never arrived at my sister’s school,” says Enriquez, adding that her brother wouldn’t answer any calls. She then used her phone’s GPS to ping Meredith’s location, showing static on Hubbard Street between San Fernando Road and Laurel Canyon in Sylmar. After reloading a few minutes later, the phone displayed a relocation: Providence Holy Cross.  Enriquez called the medical center to find out if her brother had been taken there and was told by staff there were no records of anyone admitted with his description or name. A short moment later, Enriquez received a call “from an operator” saying that her brother’s car had been involved in a “trauma accident” and “they were doing everything to save his life.”  According to Enriquez, San Fernando Police were the first responders at the accident scene and then handed it over when LAPD arrived. The investigation is being handled by the LAPD as Sylmar is part of the City of Los Angeles.  While the police investigation isn’t complete, Enriquez says a police detective from LAPD Traffic & Homicide’s Valley Traffic Division in Panorama City told her that five witnesses reported an SUV, a black Cadillac Escalade, made an illegal turn that caused her brother to veer off the road.  Some witnesses sought the family out and told them that the driver of the Escalade stopped briefly with the blinkers on and then fled the scene.  Also, Enriquez says she was told one witness caught the Escalade’s license plate number and did get a description of the woman driving the SUV, both of which were reportedly provided to police.  The LAPD has not yet released that information.  She says the accident is being investigated as a possible “hit and run”.  As per the CHP, while the driver did not hit Meredith’s car, her illegal maneuver is still viewed as a “hit and run”, while unintended, her action may have caused him to lose control of his car. And if you fail to wait for police and leave the scene, it can be investigated as a “hit and run.”  Various photos of the accident on social media show the badly crumpled car lodged into a tree on the driver’s side door.  Through Facebook, Enriquez learned some residents living in houses near the tragic accident had video recordings of it. When she tried to get those videos, she was asked to pay for them, claims Enriquez. She later learned that police detectives have collected at least two videos. It’s not clear if they’re the same videos Enriquez attempted to obtain.  While glad that Meredith is under professional care at Providence Holy Cross, his family worries about the days ahead as the young man faces various surgeries, and they ask for community support.  “All we need is prayers to make sure he doesn’t wake up with permanent damage, that’s it,” Enriquez said.  “Everything else can be figured out,” she adds. “We can take out loans to pay for his (hospitalization), we can (fix) his teeth, but brain damage? He’s 19 years old with brain damage, you’re not fixing that.”  Meredith started an automobile business before the accident. “He’s an auto broker, he was successful for a 19-year-old,” she says. “That’s almost gone if he has brain damage.”  There is also concern the young man might not walk again. “If the surgery is not successful, Matt can become paralyzed because there’s three fractures on his pelvis too close to the spine,” says Enriquez, adding, “All because someone made an illegal red turn.”  Diana Martinez contributed to this article.

""They are planning to attack the territory of the ZNPP. After that, they will announce the leakage of the radioactive substances,"" it said.

Ukraine is expected to soon start its long-anticipated counteroffensive to retake territory occupied by Russia, including in the Zaporizhzhia region.

The UN International Atomic Energy Agency has previously warned about the risks of a severe nuclear accident at the plant due to ongoing fighting.

According to the research by Bumper, these fatalities occur around the summertime when teenagers are celebrating prom, graduation ceremonies, and summer school breaks. It’s pegged as the “100 deadliest days” for traffic incidents, according to the website.  New York has a 41.6% rate of fatalities during the summer months, with August being the deadliest month overall for these fatalities, the study states.  In 2022, New York had an estimated 106 fatalities involving teen drivers, with a rate of 3.55 fatalities per 10,000 young drivers.  Within the last three years, there has been a total of 1,045 fatalities, with 105 of them involving a teen driver.  The number one state in the nation with the highest percentage of teenage driving fatalities is Wyoming, according to the study, with the average of teen driving deaths at 37.5%.  Of the fatal accidents in 2022, nearly 13% of them involved young drivers. New Mexico, Kentucky, and Mississippi have the highest teen driver fatalities, followed by North Carolina and Arkansas, overall, the study states.  Whereas states such as Rhode Island, Minnesota, Massachusetts, Iowa, and New Hampshire have the lowest teen fatality rate.  However, Wyoming, Delaware, Montana, and South Dakota have the highest percentage of teen driver fatalities during summer months of June through September, according to the study. States with the lowest percentage of teen fatalities during the summer months include Florida, Maine, Kansas, Hawaii, and Kentucky.  The study also noted that despite teenage fatalities on a decline in years prior, after the COVID-19 pandemic, they have been on a rise. The past two years, according to the study, saw the highest number of roadway deaths in the past 20 years.  Staten Island felt the surge after a driver, 17, was involved in a fatal Hylan Blvd. crash.

On January 3, the actor was hospitalized after a snowplow crushed the actor as he was trying to prevent his nephew from getting hurt. Doctors even claimed that ""it's a miracle [he was] alive"" at all.  Since then, the actor has been steadily recovering. He's even been seen jogging, with a recent social media post captioned: ""First attempt at a light jog with weight assisted life for broken tibia... Pain is progress for me.""  Jeremy Renner, the True Hero  Marvel  In an interview with Variety, Scarlett Johansson talked about how their secret Avengers text group chat (which includes herself, Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Jeremy Renner, Chris Hemsworth, and Mark Ruffalo) reacted to Renner’s recent accident.  Johansson recalled how she “was very upset,” but that once Renner started to get better, everyone made it clear he was the real hero:  “I was very upset… On the Avengers text chain, we’re like, ’OK, you beat us all. That’s it. You won… That’s like real superhero stuff. It’s unbelievable.”  Marvel  Four years ago, while speaking with the The Upcoming, Robert Downey Jr. and his wife Susan talked about the long-running Avengers text chat.  Susan revealed that it’s “used multiple times a day:”  ""All I know is he, and the other Avengers are on a text thread that is used multiple times a day. That is a family...”  Downey Jr. declared that it would “never be shut down:”  ""It will never, never be shut down, that text thread. And it should never be observed because we're out of our minds.""  A piece from The Hollywood Reporter in 2019 noted described the actor's text chain as “very sophisticated, [and] laugh-your-ass-off [funny].”  The outlet also coined the group’s dynamic as “astronaut-esque:""  “[their dynamic is] astronaut-esque — the camaraderie of people who’ve shared a professional experience almost no one can relate to.""  What Does the Future Have in Store for Renner?  When Renner was first hospitalized, it felt like the world was waiting with bated breath to see what was going to happen.  The actor got an outpouring of support from fans around the world and many of his fellow co-stars, including Hailee Steinfeld, Jason Momoa, James Gunn, and Eiza Gonzales. Even former Marvel Studios Co-President Victoria Alonso wished him ""a speedy recovery.""  But what's next for Renner?  It's clear that recovery is the number one focus right now, as it should be—as is spending time with his loved ones.  Given some more time, perhaps the actor could be up for another round of Hawkeye on Disney+. After all, audiences are itching to see more of Clint Barton and Kate Bishop in action.

The MacNeils appeared to be a happy Utah family, but looks can be deceiving.  How to Watch Watch Accident, Suicide, or Murder on Oxygen Saturdays 8/7c and next day on Peacock. Catch up on the Oxygen App.  Shortly before noon on April 11, 2007, Dr. Martin MacNeil made a frantic call to 911. He said his wife, Michele, had fallen in the tub and that he was performing CPR.  Minutes later, paramedics arrived and rushed to the upstairs bathroom. The tub had been drained, and Michele was lying on her back on the floor next to it.  “First responders started performing CPR,” Chad Grunander, Deputy Attoney of Utah County, told Accident, Suicide or Murder, airing Saturdays at 8/7c on Oxygen. “They found her to be cold to the touch. But they continued to do what they could to try and save her life.”  Michele, 50, a former beauty queen, was then rushed to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead.  Michele MacNeil's 6-Year-Old Makes Tragic Discovery  Michele Macneil, featured on Accident Suicide or Murder 418 Photo: Oxygen  It was a tragedy for a well-respected member of the community. Michele was known as a devoted and loving mother of eight, including four adopted children from Ukraine. Martin worked as a physician. He also had a law degree.  Investigators from the Utah County Sheriff’s Department were called to look into how Michele met such an untimely death.  Michele had been discovered by 6-year-old Ada MacNeil, who alerted her father. Martin said that he found her hunched over the tub like she had been trying to fill it up and then passed out. He sent Ada to a neighbor for help as he called 911.  RELATED: Utah Man Killed Wife In Their Backyard Fish Pond And Claimed She Drowned By Accident  Martin mentioned that Michele had been taking several drugs as part of her recovery and suggested that maybe Michele had overdosed and drowned, according to Grunander.  “This did look like an accident,” he said.  What Michele MacNeil's Autopsy Revealed  The medical examiner found no signs of injuries, just healing incisions on her face where she’d had plastic surgery a week and a half earlier. On April 12, the autopsy revealed that Michele was suffering from myocarditis, an infection in the heart. She also had chronic hypertension.  Related  The toxicology screening of Michele’s blood revealed “a cocktail of a number of substances,” said Grunander. Ambien, oxycodone, Phenergan had all been prescribed because of Michele’s plastic surgery.  The medical examiner determined the cause of death as natural due to myocarditis and chronic hypertension. Law enforcement started to wrap up the investigation.  Red Flags Are Raised in Michele MacNeil Investigation  At the service for Michele, Martin’s behavior came into question by family members. He appeared to make it all about him, they said. At a luncheon that followed, he was overheard commenting that he’d now have more time for golf. Red flags were raised.  Alexis Somers, 24, the couple’s daughter who was in medical school, also thought that her dad was somehow involved in her mom’s death.  She told police that before her death, Michele suspected Martin was having an affair, said Sara Lenz, a former reporter with Deseret News. She had noted frequent calls from a woman named Gypsy Willis.  Investigators learned that Martin urged Michele to get a facelift sooner, not later. A day after Michele’s surgery, Alexis found her heavily drugged. Michele’s eyes were bandaged so she didn’t see the drugs Martin gave to her.  Alexis stayed with her mom until she had to return to medical school. By then, Michele was taking just one pill a day.  When Martin learned of his family members’ suspicions, he banned Alexis from his home.  Gypsy Willis became the younger MacNeil children’s nanny just days after Michele’s death. Unlike most nannies, she didn’t cook, clean, or do household duties, according to Jill Harper-Smith, Michele’s niece: “She wasn’t a nanny at all.”  Related  “At that point, it was clear that Gypsy was really the mistress,” said Grunander.  Six months after Michele’s death, the case was reopened.  Detectives discovered that Martin had lied about his age to get into the military, and that he had a long history of forging checks leading to theft and fraud. That sparked a federal investigation of Martin, while Utah County detectives continued to dig into Michelle’s death.  RELATED: Man Choked His Girlfriend To Death In Scrapyard And Staged The Scene To Look Like She Hanged Herself  Investigators interviewed the 911 dispatcher, first responders, and neighbors to get a better picture of the events. While Martin said he found Michele draped over the tub, a neighbor at the scene said she was in the tub. Ada also said her mom was on her back in the tub filled with water.  A Second Look at Michele MacNeil's Death by the Medical Examiner  Investigators turned to the medical examiner’s report to figure out the truth and Michelle’s body position. The findings contradicted Martin’s version of the events.  “It suggested that Martin was trying to stage the scene to make it look like this was an accidental death,” said Grunander.  The investigative team got an expert toxicologist's opinion on the medications found in Michele’s system.  “The combination of drugs stood out to me,” said Dr. Todd Grey, former Utah State Chief Medical Examiner.  Grey described the case as “funky,” but that was not enough to change Michele’s cause of death.  Homicide investigators turned to the federal investigation, which had uncovered several more transgressions in Martin’s past. Martin had counterfeited documents to get into medical school and gave a false statement about a felony when he applied to law school at Brigham Young University, according to James Wissler, a retired federal agent with the U.S. Defense Department.  A Shocking Twist in Michele MacNeil Case  In the spring of 2008, Giselle, one of the adopted children from Ukraine, had gone missing. Martin said he sent her to Ukraine to visit family.  It was determined that Giselle’s birth date on her birth certificate had changed by 20 years.  “Martin MacNeill essentially sent his adopted Ukrainian daughter back to Ukraine so that he could pass along this identity to his mistress Gypsy Willis,” said Wissler.  That would enable Willis to wriggle out of a tax debt she owed, investigators said. Martin had also put his home up for sale at the time.  Federal investigators suspected that Martin and Willis were preparing to flee the U.S. Through a carefully coordinated plan, Martin MacNeil and Gypsy Willis were arrested simultaneously in 2012.  Martin MacNeil Is Sentenced  Martin pleaded guilty to aggravated identity theft and giving a false statement. He was sentenced to four years in federal prison. Willis was sentenced to two years.  Utah detectives used the four years to build their case. Michele’s plastic surgeon revealed that Martin dictated the drugs he wanted prescribed for his wife. Because Martin was a doctor, his orders went unquestioned.  Could the mix of drugs be enough to cause Michele to be unable to resist a threat to her well-being? The medical examiner determined the answer was yes. Michele’s cause of death was changed to undetermined.  “It opened the window into a potential prosecution for homicide,” said Grunander. Investigators believed that Martin drugged Michele, and then drowned her.  Willis couldn’t be tied to Michele’s death.  On July 6, 2012, Martin, recently out of federal prison, was arrested for his wife’s murder. Prosecutors believed they had a strong circumstantial case. Somers and Willis were both called to testify by prosecutors.  On November 9, 2012, Martin MacNeil was found guilty of murder and obstruction of justice. He was sentenced to 35 years in prison. In April 2017, after losing an appeal, Martin MacNeill died by suicide in prison.

Houston, Texas--(Newsfile Corp. - May 28, 2023) - Amidst an increase in the number of uninsured drivers on Texas state roads in recent years - with figures from the Houston Chronicle suggesting that as of four years ago, Houston was home to the highest rate of such motorists in the entire nation, Reyna Law Firm has therefore brought forward its new insurance claim assistance services.  For more information, see https://www.reynainjurylaw.com/houston.  To view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:  Specifically, a lack of appropriate insurance coverage among drivers involved in crashes can significantly exacerbate the fallout of accidents, explains JR Reyna, Reyna Law Firm's founder and lead attorney. Spanning representation and legal counsel for accident victims, Reyna Law Firm's new services are designed to assist victims to recover damages from uninsured drivers.  ""Being involved in an auto accident can be a traumatic experience, especially when the other driver doesn't have insurance coverage,"" said JR Reyna, Reyna Law Firm's founder and lead attorney. ""We are here to help those who have been injured in these types of accidents.""  This includes cases where clients are seeking reimbursement for property damage, personal injury, or both. Its attorneys point to the ongoing need for car crash victims to make up for lost wages or pay outstanding medical bills - situations the firm has encountered with its past clientele.  As part of the new services, Reyna Law Firm is now able to advise potential clients regarding their eligibility for reimbursement in several contexts. ""Drivers who carry full comprehensive insurance coverage, including UM/UIM coverage, can protect themselves and their property in the event of an accident,"" says JR Reyna. ""UM/UIM coverage can also provide additional protection in the event of a hit-and-run accident or an accident caused by a driver with insufficient insurance coverage.""  Once insurance status is established and evidence is gathered where possible, Reyna Law Firm will represent clients through the injury claims process. Likewise, the firm represents uninsured drivers who may be able to pursue claims where the at-fault motorist was driving while impaired.

"accident","2022-06-11","15:30:00","{""Calcutta"", ""WestBengal"", ""India""}","2023-05-28T04:02:00","Tata's build quality has actually gone up by a huge leap. The interior is well-made as well.  BHPian vivek_saha1304 recently shared this with other enthusiasts.  HISTORY: This is a long story about why I had to part ways with my old car. Please scroll past this to the new car section if not interested  Our cars are not just machines which require regular maintenance and fuel to carry us safely wherever we want to. We love our cars with all heart and treat it as family member and it all pays back on that one day when you need your car the most, be it to save you from a major accident or to rush to an office meeting. Something quite similar happened to me the previous year on the 11th of June, 2022 when we met with a fatal accident around 3:30 pm. We were travelling from Kolkata to Jamshedpur to my uncle's place to consult a doctor. The traffic was close to nil because the previous day there had been inter-religion riots in Howrah, West Bengal so there was army intervention and some areas were sealed down.  So we made good progress for most part of the journey after which we decided to take a break and switch drivers. My dad was driving until now, but he seemed tired from all the glare of that afternoon sun, so he asked me to drive. As luck would have it, my phone was in my trouser's left pocket and somehow it slipped and fell. I unbuckled my seatbelt to pick it up and then forgot to wear my seatbelt. We were now almost 50 kms away from Jamshedpur town and were approaching the intersection where the dreaded accident took place- the place was ""DHALBHUMGARH."" I could see from almost 500m ahead that a truck was parked or as it seemed to me and my dad, with both left and right wheels left to shoulder line. Not even a wheel was protruding out on the highway. So I flashed my lights once and even honked a little and continued with the same speed. Just as we were approaching the truck, it suddenly decided to take a U-turn and turned its wheels and came onto the highway. The truck was so long that I had no space left to zig-zag my way out of it. Even if there was some space my high speed wouldn't allow me to turn the steering wheel even by an inch. I panicked and braked so my wheels had completely locked up as my car had no ABS, and to top that off I was in a non-airbag car without a seatbelt. The car hit the truck's front wheel and it probably jumped from inertia. Me and my parents had completely blacked out and when I opened my eyes I saw that my father somehow managed to get out of the car struggling to breathe, I had hit my forehead on the windscreen and also severed the lower portion of my left arm when it hit the armrest. I somehow kicked open the door and went round the car shouting ""MAA!! MAA!!"" and tried to open the left back door.  That is when I realised that my left arm was not working and it was bleeding like hell as if someone was pouring a bottle of red wine down my forearm. I blacked out again and luckily there were some people to hold me. They carried me in a police van and then my mother also had to be carried but I could walk. We were then taken to Tata Medical Hospital(TMH) where we got to know that my mother had a shattered shoulder and hip joint. My left forearm was in bad shape and it needed an immediate operation. My parents decided that it would be better if we had all medical treatment in Kolkata. So that night we booked an ambulance and rode through the night to Kolkata. The next morning we arrived at Apollo Gleneagles, Kolkata and the three of us were admitted.  Now comes the surprising part where most people would not believe the car I was driving and how did we manage to come out of it alive.  We were in a 2016 model MS Swit VXI. It's very hard to imagine how this car saved us. I'm sure there was some supernatural power which protected us but still it's beyond my belief.  I'm also attaching some pictures after the accident to realise how major the impact was. I knew that even if the insurance co. somehow manages to pay for the repair it would still be packing a few problems. But unfortunately, the repair cost came out to be much higher than the IDV and we had to take that sum of money and let go of our car. That is when I decided to buy Altroz.  Buying experience  I knew that the safest hatchback back then was the Tata Altroz, so one casual day I decided to call and ask for a test drive of the Altroz(P). I liked the design very much and when I shut the door, I immediately realised its build quality. The heavy doors, butter-smooth steering wheel, ultra-light clutch and somewhat smooth gearbox gave me a good first impression. But the bummer came in the form of an underpowered, noisy and harsh 3-cylinder engine.  Having owned Swift for almost 6 years and Polo for 11 years I was truly disappointed with the three-cylinder NA engine.  As soon as the test drive was over I told the salesman that I wasn't happy with the engine as such, but I would consider this to be on my buying list whilst I TD some other cars. He then suggested that I should try out the diesel engine once. A couple of days later he came around my house again with a diesel model, and this wasn't a TD model. The Dealer had bought an Altroz (D) for his personal use which surely made me feel confident about the car. It had run 24000 kms and there wasn't a single noise coming from the interior. I was impressed that the clutch was extremely light even in the diesel version. The engine though audible enough, was not harsh. I could feel the vibrations of the petrol engine on the pedals but the diesel somehow was smoother. I may be wrong but the gearshifts in the diesel model felt much smoother than the petrol. As soon as I was on the main road I could clearly feel the superiority of the diesel mill. The engine was way more responsive, it pulled nice and clean in every gear and moreover, it had almost no knocking issues. My dad was blown away by the fact that how far diesel has come in terms of refinement. Most people sitting on the inside would not notice that it is a diesel engine unless informed. The diesel pull was very addictive, and boy oh boy was I happy with the way the car handled. I think after VW, Tata tunes its cars the best in terms of handling and ride comfort. The car was able to overcome all speed breakers and at the same time give me as much confidence through the corners as my Polo does.  I had made up my mind about going with the diesel option, but a premium of 1.25 lacs came as a surprise to me and my dad. With budget being a factor we had initially decided to go with the XM+ petrol variant which cost around 8 lacs, but the diesel one cost 9.4 lacs, which was out of my father's budget. So we had to downgrade to XE+ and settle for that one. Even that cost 8.5 lacs on-road.  So with a token amount of 11k, we booked the car and waited for it to arrive. The car arrived around 40 days later when I and my childhood friend went for the PDI. It was the 22nd of October and the car was manufactured in October itself. I was delighted to have such a fresh car straight out of the factory. The PDI went well and there was another son and father duo who had come for their PDI of the Punch. Since it was their first car, they had little knowledge about it and asked me if I would check the car for them. The car was July made and the rest all was okay. Even in that car, I felt that the gearbox was not as smooth shifting as my diesel car. Maybe it's something to do with the clutch mechanism or not. Don't really know.  1000 kms were covered very fast and reached a service centre close to my home the very next day. Everyone is aware of the state of Tata Service centres but I was very lucky that the one near my house is actually very good. Both the staff and mechanics were very friendly and they welcomed me to freely stand beside my car and watch it getting serviced.  The first free service meant just visual inspection of every bit and torquing all nuts properly. I always believed in changing the oil after the first 1000 km so went ahead with it. TM Genuine 0w20 oil was used and it claimed to be fully synthetic. Was charged around 3200 for the oil and 300 for the filter.  The engine was a lot smoother post the oil change, and mileage increased as well. I believe this car is designed to run endlessly on open highways the way the suspension has been tuned for stability and the way the motor chugs along at 80-90 whilst returning an avg of 25 to 26.  POSITIVES  Tata's build quality has actually gone up by a huge leap. The interior is well-made as well. There are hardly any squeaks coming from the plastic parts and the multimedia buttons seem to be of good enough quality to last long, hopefully. I think the diesel engine is the most sensible choice among the three because it has good power as well as efficiency. Within a city without AC this engine delivers stunning mileage, of 16 to 17km/l. And not to forget my daily route is North to South Of Kolkata which is packed with traffic any moment of the day. The steering is at a different level altogether. I have driven the Polo for thousands of kms on the highway but Altroz's steering wheel is more direct as well as responsive. Headlights are actually good and I don't think I will be changing them soon. The Harman music system is truly exceptional at this price point. I won't be changing this as well except put a touch screen system a couple of years later.  NEGATIVES  The AC when switched on makes a whining sound which increases with the rise in RPM. Having told TASS they said it was normal in Altroz. Would like to hear from anyone who has a diesel model on this topic. Mileage takes a serious hit with the AC always on. I may be procrastinating but I think the whining sound indicates that something is wrong which is also the reason mileage takes a hit. Non-AC mileage was around 16 to 17 which has dropped to 13 to 14 with ac on. Refuelling has been done only from COCO Pumps and all calculations are based on tank to tank method.  Apart from this, the car runs like a dream. Have no problems with it.

The ex-New Zealand Warriors and Parramatta Eels boss was body surfing at Soldiers Beach near Norah Head while on a family vacation when out of nowhere disaster struck.  The 56-year-old was dumped on his head by a wave and suffered a catastrophic spinal injury.  He quickly went into a cardiac arrest and had to be dragged out of the surf semi-conscious.  The father of four was fortunate that a couple of off-duty paramedics happened to be on the beach that day - and quickly got him airlifted to the spinal unit at Royal North Shore hospital.

'I was dragged from the water unresponsive and then went into cardiac arrest,' Anderson told News Corp.  'I'm very lucky the paramedics were there. I was obviously in a bad way. If they weren't there, who knows how it would have finished up.'  Later it was revealed that Anderson had severe compression of the spinal cord.  'I was classified as an incomplete quadriplegic,' Anderson said. 'Incomplete means that you can get little bits back, but some things you never can.  'No one can tell you categorically what, if any movement you get back. But after four days I was wiggling my big toe.  'Right now I need assistance with everything, brushing my teeth, feeding, bathing, having a coffee.  'I've got slight movement in my right hand. Just enough to softly shake hands.  'Three weeks ago I couldn't do that. It's progress.'  Anderson was classified as an incomplete quadriplegic after arriving at hospital  Anderson, who coached the Warriors and the Eels to NRL grand finals, says the first few weeks were really tough for him and his family.  'You can't equate this predicament to the pressures of coaching. But the mental strength you've got to have in tough times in football helps,' he said.  'This is much tougher. But you've got to grab hold of the situation. You've got to try to move forward and take one challenge at a time.'

Then the Plainview native's world came to an abrupt halt. In March 2021, Koltun sustained a catastrophic injury while skiing at Stratton Mountain in Vermont that left her with severe spinal cord injuries and paralyzed from the neck down. Family members and aides now care for her round-the-clock, from feeding to bathing, for Koltun, 23, an athlete who loved playing soccer. ""Finding out that I was essentially unable to move anything in my body was heartbreaking,"" Koltun said. ""I thought I was the saddest person in the world. I thought my life was over. It was extremely difficult to grasp the concept. ""It was larger than life essentially. So my life has drastically changed because I have virtually no independence. I am washed and dressed by someone else. I can't even itch my own face."" But after nine months of intensive rehab — and some admittedly dark days — Koltun says she has learned to live with her disability rather than be defined by her condition. Koltun has learned to paint using only her mouth and began selling her artwork on Etsy. She has modeled for a group that designs clothing for people with a variety of disabilities, and edits patient education videos for a physician. She also graduated from Binghamton. In an effort to share her story and help others in her condition, Koltun frequently discusses her physical and mental health tribulations on podcasts. And she has become something of a social media star, creating popular content — albeit with a tinge of self-deprecating, dark humor — on TikTok, where her account, titled ""notparalyzedjustlazy,"" has nearly 60,000 followers. ""What this has shown me is that there is life after loss, even something as devastating as my situation,"" Koltun said. ""I try to do things like paint and hang out with my friends and watch the movies and go out to lunch and go out to dinner. And just focus on the things that I can do rather than the things that I have lost. Because if I thought about that I would never get out of a downward spiral. ""I'm just grateful for the little things I still do have and for all the people that care about me so much,"" she added. The reality of Koltun's injuries are not only daunting physically and emotionally but financially as well. She needs specially trained nursing staff, physical, occupational and respiratory therapies, along with a custom wheelchair, adapted van, electronic hospital bed and Hoyer lift, plus a bevy of medical supplies that require ongoing maintenance and replenishment. Friends and family said the cost of her care exceeded $1 million in the year after her injury and likely will average between $200,000 and $300,000 a year for the rest of her life. The family relies on health insurance to cover some of her care, but much of the balance comes from fundraising. On Saturday morning, more than 700 friends, family and others gathered at Plainview Old Bethpage Middle School for the second annual ""Rally for Rebecca 5K"" race and fun run. That was about 50 more people than last year, said Wendy Mensch, a family friend who has known Koltun all her life and who helped organize the run. The event, held on a sunny day perfect for being outside, raised about $70,000, she added, far more than the $50,000 last year. All of the proceeds for the event will go to Help Hope Live, a nonprofit that will distribute the proceeds to Koltun's family. To date, the group has raised more than $320,000 for Koltun's care and recovery. ""Walking for Rebecca really brought every individual there a good feeling,"" said Judith Brenner, a close family friend who helps organize the event. ""The money is part of it.

To this day, she does not recall the fall but was found unconscious in the woods on the mountain and had to be airlifted to Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in New Hampshire. The damage to her spinal cord was so severe that Koltun was attached to a ventilator, unable to breathe on her own. She had immediate surgery and spent 2½ weeks in the intensive care unit before being transferred to a rehabilitation hospital in Boston, where she would spend another 4½ months, finally getting off the ventilator and learning to drive a wheelchair by breathing into a straw. Koltun spent another four months at Glen Cove Hospital before being discharged to an assisted living facility, where she and her parents lived while their Plainview home was being renovated.

Unfortunately at that point it appeared that a front suspension component broke on his bright yellow Nolen Racing No. 20, and he crashed hard into the outside wall in Turn 1. Although he escaped injury, his KECO Coatings-sponsored Beast with a Tranter Chevy V8 suffered front-end damage and he was unable to continue in the 146-lap race.  The Franklin, Ind.-based driver, who was making his first USAC Silver Crown pavement start, unofficially finished 28th.  Axsom ran a 42.618 for two laps around the 0.686-mile asphalt oval in qualifying, which was just 0.892 off the time Bobby Santos ran to earn the pole.  Nathan Byrd passed Axsom at the start of the race to push him from seventh to eighth, but Axsom was able to hold off veteran Russ Gamester for the first 31 laps. Taylor Ferns passed Gamester on a restart on lap 31 and inched ahead of Axsom for an instant too, but he passed her back on the same lap and never dropped out of eighth place on the lap charts.  Gamester passed Ferns back on lap 34 to draw behind Axsom again, but once again Axsom was able to prevail until his car darted into the outside guardrail in Turn 1 working lap 41 to bring out the third yellow.  Axsom’s fastest lap of the race was lap three, when he was timed in 22.156 seconds. It was the 11th-fastest lap anyone ran in the race, which attracted the largest USAC Silver Crown field for a pavement race in 18 years with 35 entries.  Bobby Santos III won over Logan Seavey, Tyler Roahrig, Derek Bischak and Ferns.  In addition to Friday’s race, Nolen Racing plans to field a USAC Silver Crown car for Axsom in the races on 1-mile dirt tracks: Aug. 19 at the Illinois State Fairgrounds in Springfield and Sept. 2 at the Du Quoin State Fairgrounds in Du Quoin, Ill. One or two other USAC Silver Crown races on asphalt tracks will be added to the mix as scheduling permits.  Nolen Racing’s next race is tonight, Saturday, Nov. 27 when it fields asphalt sprint cars for Axsom and Shane Hollingsworth in the Lucas Oil Little 500 Presented by UAW at Anderson (Ind.) Speedway. Axsom will start fourth and Hollingsworth right behind him in seventh in the 33-car field.  Friday’s race was streamed live on Flo Racing and the Little 500 will be streamed live by MAVTV for Flo Racing.

The zebra was running and chasing the impalas in the zoo’s habitat when he lost his footing and ran into one of the posts on a wire containment fence, WISN-TV reported.  Although veterinary officials immediately responded to the animal, Stuart did not survive his injuries, according to the television station.  “This tragic accident is a heartbreaking loss for the animal care team, and for everyone who cares about the zoo’s animals,” officials said in a statement. “The focus now is on the well-being of the impalas and the ostriches who share the habitat.”  Zoo officials are still awaiting results to determine the zebra’s cause of death. Stuart was born in 2018 at the Hemker Park and Zoo in Freeport, Minnesota and arrived in Milwaukee the following year.  Tim Wild, the zoo’s large mammal curator, told WISN that the zebra “was running too fast” and lost his footing while trying to make a turn.  Stuart is the sixth large animal to die at the zoo this year, according to the television station. A jaguar was euthanized in February after health issues. A groundhog died in March, and two giraffes died that same month. In April, Sanchi, a 26-year-old camel, also died, WISN reported.  “Sometimes they come in groups like this. It’s unfortunate, but a lot of the animals that have died here this year have been very old, died of old age-related things that we know were coming,” Wild told the television station. “So, when we have a surprise like this, a disease or an accident, it’s just kind of odd.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmtpcm83LmNvbS9uZXdzL3RyZW5kaW5nL3plYnJhLWRpZXMtYWZ0ZXItdHJhZ2ljLWFjY2lkZW50LW1pbHdhdWtlZS1jb3VudHktem9vL0ZONzI3VjNOVEpIWFZJNDZCWUxTM0xISDJBL9IBhAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5raXJvNy5jb20vbmV3cy90cmVuZGluZy96ZWJyYS1kaWVzLWFmdGVyLXRyYWdpYy1hY2NpZGVudC1taWx3YXVrZWUtY291bnR5LXpvby9GTjcyN1YzTlRKSFhWSTQ2QllMUzNMSEgyQS8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"accident","2023-05-26","Not Discerned","{""Cheju"", ""ChejuDo"", ""SouthKorea""}","2023-05-26T11:23:31","This accident happened on Friday the 26th of May 2023. It involved Asiana Airlines flight OZ-8124, which departed from Jeju International Airport (RKPC) in South Korea. The destination of the domestic flight was Daegu International Airport (RKTN). This is a 40-minute flight that Asiana performs daily, departing just before noon.  On the day of this A321 door accident, the Asiana flight had 194 passengers and crew on board. The flight itself appears to have been routine, departing from Jeju with only a small delay and cruising at FL210. Initially, it wasn’t clear what altitude the Asiana A321 was at when a door opened.  The classic Airbus A321 (A321ceo) and early versions of the A321neo have four doors on each side. All of them are full-size doors, i.e. none are over-wing exits. This accident appears to involve the third door on the left side, which is sometimes called the “waist” door. Newer A321neos have the “Flex” door configuration, with over-wing exits and a waist door that is further to the rear.  Asiana Passenger Opens A321 Door – Why?  According to available reports, the authorities arrested the passenger who was sitting next to this door. They allege that this passenger opened the door intentionally. The passenger reportedly said that he had been touching the lever that opens the door. However, this lever needs to be lifted up intentionally, traveling a considerable distance, for the door to open.  The flight crew continued for a safe landing on runway 13R in Daegu. They landed about a minute after the opening of the door. But during that time, the open door meant that several of the passengers on board the Asiana A321 suffered from breathing difficulties, because of the oncoming rush of air.  Airport police reported that nine passengers needed hospital treatment. It is not clear if the passenger sitting by the door was one of them. Pictures show that the emergency slide activated when the Asiana passenger opened the left-side waist door of this A321. Obviously, the airflow ripped off the slide.  As of this writing, the aircraft remains on the ground in Daegu. This is an eleven-year-old Airbus A321-200, with tail number HL8256. It has seats for 195 passengers, and Asiana has been its only operator since new. The airline has 14 of these jets, plus another 7 newer A321neos.

However, shortly before the historic and controversial Mr. Olympia contest, Zane had a near career-ending accident. It resulted in the defending champion losing 15 lbs of muscle and might have cost him the prestigious title. However, the bodybuilding legend who defeated Arnold Schwarzenegger also sustained other injuries.  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad  Besides the 1980 accident, The Chemist had sustained injuries in his shoulders and a nagging lower back injury. In January, 43 years after the accident, the 80-year-old bodybuilding veteran disclosed how he manages these injuries. The three-time Mr. Olympia also revealed a technique people rarely used to treat injuries.  Injuries and an uncommon therapy to treat the pain  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad  Before 1980, Mr. Olympia, Zane, was confident about his chances of winning a fourth Sandow. However, a routine swim in his house pool turned into a nightmare scenario for the bodybuilder. “One day I jumped in the pool. I hit the lip of the pool in my urethra, smashed my urethra,” recounted the 80-year-old in an interview with Lisa Alastuey. However, he doesn’t consider it the worst one of his career.  In the Jan 2023 interview with Keep Fit Kingdom, The Chemist revealed “the worst” injuries of his career. “Both shoulders,” said Zane. “I had my right shoulder replaced 10 or 12 years ago. It’s fine now,” Zane revealed during the interview. He also disclosed he had rotator cuff surgery on his left shoulder. Besides the traditional methods, Zane revealed his lesser-known technique.  Besides regular stretching, heat, and cold therapy, Frank Zane uses ultrasound to treat pain. While bodybuilders resort to the other methods the 80-year-old mentioned, The Chemist also uses ultrasound “when something gets a bit serious.” The interviewer found the former Mr. Universe’s answer fascinating and asked for his opinion.  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad  Frank Zane vouches for the special therapy  Frank Zane said he would keep most of his old injuries from falling up through stretching and regular exercise. He also takes some supplements and maintains a strict diet at 80. However, if nothing works, the former champion turns to ultrasound therapy. “I think it’s a really good therapy,” Zane told the interviewer.  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad  The man who defeated The Austrian Oak also doesn’t use ultrasound therapy as the only method when something severe happens. “I’ll use ultrasound then follow it up with ice,” he said. While not widely used, The Chemist approves of the therapy. Did you know about ultrasound used for pain relief? Let us know in the comments.

"accident","2023-05-25","14:00:00","Not Discerned","2023-05-26T12:17:11","The Department for Transport (DfT) has released the latest official statistics on the number of road traffic casualties which occurred in Britain in 2022. The provisional figures include all reported collisions which occurred on a public highway and involved at least one motor vehicle, horse rider or pedal cyclist, and in which at least one person was injured, but are likely to under-estimate the number of non-fatal, minor injuries, which are not always reported to the police.  The latest road casualty statistics show a worrying rise in personal injuries from road accidents, which have almost returned to pre-pandemic road casualty levels. This confirms RAC research findings of increasing concerns about poor driving standards on British roads, leading to calls for government action to reintroduce road casualty targets and adequate road traffic policing.  In 2022, more than 28,000 people were left living with the physical, emotional and financial after-effects of serious or life-changing injury, and nearly 1700 families mourned a sudden and tragic loss of a loved one’s life.  How many people were injured in road traffic accidents in 2022?  According to the DfT’s provisional road casualty statistics for road collisions in Britain in 2022 there were a total of 136,002 casualties of all severities. Of these, 1,695 people died and 28,101 were seriously injured. It is estimated that 106,206 people suffered minor injuries.  Three quarters (75%) of those who died, and nearly two thirds (62%) of all casualties across the range of severities were male. Both males and females in the 30 to 49 year age group had the highest number of casualties overall. Fatal injury was also more common in males aged 30 to 49, but in women over 70 years of age. A quarter of all fatalities (25%) and 29% of casualties were aged 17 to 29. Children under 17 years of age accounted for 3% of deaths and 10% of all injuries.  The road casualty statistics for 2022 show that:  46% (781) of people who died (fatalities) were car occupants;  22% (376) of fatalities were pedestrians;  21% (354) of fatalities were motorcyclists;  5% (85) of fatalities were pedal cyclists;  64 were goods vehicle occupants;  4 were bus or coach occupants;  30 were occupants of other or unknown vehicles.  Across all types of casualties:  55% (74,806) of those injured were car occupants;  14% ( 19,384) were pedestrians;  12% (16,962) were motorcyclists;  12% ( 15,689 ) were pedal cyclists;  4,735 were goods vehicles occupants;  2,277 were occupants of other vehicles;  2,147 were bus or coach occupants.  How many people were injured in e-scooter collisions?  The DfT road casualty statistics do not specify the number of e-scooter collision injuries but note that they are included within the wider category of ‘other vehicle’ road casualties. However, they refer to an e-scooter factsheet published by the DfT which shows that more than 1,400 casualties in e-scooter collisions were reported by the police in the year ending June 2022. A total of 12 people were killed in those e-scooter accidents, of which 11 were e-scooter riders and one was a pedestrian.  E-scooter collisions caused minor injury to 996 people and serious injury to 429 people. Severe injuries from e-scooter collision accidents included:  79 head injuries, of which 35 were classed as severe;  4 broken neck/back injuries;  6 ‘multiple injuries’;  45 fractured lower leg/ankle/foot injuries;  40 fractured collarbone/arm/hand injuries;  9 fractured pelvis/upper leg injuries;  severe chest injuries.  Of those who were the most seriously injured in e-scooter collisions:  347 were e-scooter users;  62 were pedestrians;  18 were pedal cyclists;  2 were motorcyclists.  More than 400 e-scooter casualties were under the age of 19. 14 of them were children under the age of 10. The Department for Transport estimated that around half (564) of all the e-scooter user casualties recorded in these statistics occurred outside of e-scooter rental trial areas.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxleG9sb2d5LmNvbS9saWJyYXJ5L2RldGFpbC5hc3B4P2c9MDViZDY5MDAtOWU0OC00Njk5LWFhM2YtNTc2M2ViYjAzODQ10gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"accident","2023-05-26","02:49:00","Not Discerned","2023-05-26T21:23:12","A tragic wrong-way accident in Downtown Los Angeles claimed one life and left three victims hospitalized. The California Highway Patrol (CHP) responded to the scene in the northbound lanes of 110 Freeway near USC Campus early Friday morning.  NBC Los Angeles reported the tragedy was first called in at 2:49 a.m. after a chain-reaction crash near the Exposition Boulevard interchange on May 26, 2023.  The CHP determined that a driver traveling in the northbound lanes of the freeway in the wrong direction caused a head-on accident that eventually involved several vehicles.  One victim in the impact was rushed to a local hospital with life-threatening injuries. Sadly, the male victim could not be saved and was pronounced dead at the hospital. Three other victims were judged to be in critical condition and were taken to the hospital.  CHP investigators continue to examine the circumstances surrounding the accident to determine why the at-fault driver ended up on the freeway headed in the opposite direction of traffic.  Maison Law of Los Angeles also posted information about this tragic accident along with information on how victims and their families can seek accident support.  110 Freeway Accident Dangers in Los Angeles  Freeway traffic in Los Angeles has always been dangerous. There are police chases, drivers racing each other, and even drivers who fall asleep at the wheel.  Drivers can read over emails and texts on their cell phones and miss spotting red lights and important traffic warnings. Motorists can also take to the roads after consuming drugs or alcohol which impairs their judgment and reaction times. These mistakes lead to too many deadly incidents throughout L.A. each year.  California transportation officials monitor accident rates on all freeways running through Los Angeles. Their research showed that there were at least 845 accidents involving injuries on 110 Freeway through Los Angeles County in 2022. 23 people tragically lost their lives in those collisions.  Those figures were down slightly from 2021 cases when 937 serious accidents occurred on the freeway, costing 31 lives.  The shocking accident numbers should be enough to encourage all Los Angeles drivers to slow down and take more responsibility for their actions before a mistake is made that can’t be undone.  What To Do After a Car Accident in Los Angeles  Victims of dangerous accidents and their families are encouraged to stay informed of every benefit available to them. A Los Angeles Car Accident Lawyer will discuss your case with you in a free consultation. This case review is confidential and comes with no obligation to you or your family. After a scary collision, victims should be able to secure the best medical care available and cover the costs.

Mariana Campos-Jimenez was charged with intoxication manslaughter in the May 2020 head-on crash that killed 44-year-old Gabriel Gallegos.  At the time of the accident, Campos-Jimenez was only 20 and driving the wrong way on Loop 1604 and Lockhill Selma Road.  The Gallegos family is still dealing with the devastating loss three years later.  “How do you fill the gap of a lost loved one? You can’t,” Gabriel’s brother Gino Gallegos said.  The family has been closely following the case and on Friday, Campos-Jimenez accepted an open plea and pled no contest.  An open plea agreement means the judge can decide anywhere from two to 20 years, but the defense is requesting deferred adjudication.  Deferred adjudication is a special kind of probation that would give Campos-Jimenez the opportunity to keep the conviction off her record.  While Gino Gallegos didn’t want to say much about a potential sentence, he said the family is looking for closure and will return on July 13th for sentencing.  “That’s what we’ve been waiting for, to have justice for my brother,” Gallegos said.

"accident","1969-09-02","14:00:00","{""Clarksville"", ""Tennessee"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-26T20:26:00","CLARKSVILLE, TN – In 1969, Joseph Ricky Reynolds made a decision that set a course for his life he never imagined. Now, 54 years later, Reynolds proves that change takes courage and that dreams are possible.  Reynolds was 15 years old during the height of the Vietnam War. “Young people were rebelling, and the school here was a little bit, a little bit wild at that time—a lot of fights. A lot of crazy stuff going on,” he explains. “I skipped some classes, but I didn’t do bad on grades back then,” he says.  One afternoon, Reynolds and his friends decided to drive out to Paris Landing to swim. But when he dove into the shallow water, Reynolds broke his neck, paralyzing him.  “I felt some hands grab me and pull me out,” he remembers. “When I raised up, it was like 1 million needles were sticking all through me, and I flopped back down, and I can’t remember much from that moment on.” Hours passed until he finally made it to Vanderbilt University Medical Center. The doctor told his family if he made it through the night, he would never walk again.  “I was 15, going on 16, and I couldn’t move anything,” he explains how he stayed immobile in the hospital bed for the next 57 days. “I couldn’t move my legs. I had no feeling from about my chest down.” He pauses as the memories from the experience still overwhelm him. After nearly two months in the hospital, “I started moving my toes.”  Finding a way back  “At that time, I was rough and tough and mean. It turned me around, you know; I started going to church trying to do better, and it completely turned my life. In one way, it was the best thing that ever happened to me.”  After 63 days in the hospital, Reynolds walked out using two canes. Recovery would be a long slow process. Returning to school, an even longer wait. Reynolds recalls that his family’s home was 20 miles from the school down an old gravel road. “I was going to have to catch a school bus to go to school and try to deal with getting on a bus, getting off,” he says. “In a lot of ways, it was a good thing because when (Charlotte High School) said, ‘Hey, we’re really not equipped. Really what they were saying, we’re not equipped to handle your situation. That’s pretty much what they were saying. In a real nice way.”  Refusing to give up, Reynolds found the next best thing and began to work at his uncle’s hardware store. “Just keep on moving. It was my theory. Keep on, keep going forward, doing the best I could.” It is this mindset that continues to propel him forward. He met his wife, became a successful businessman, and raised a family. Through it all, “I’ve always been an advocate of education.”  Returning to school  His daughter, Misty, first introduced the idea of Adult High School.  Reynolds was apprehensive but could not resist the idea of returning to school. He praised Judy Weimer, school counselor at Adult High School, and the team for their support through the process. After his daughter set up his home computer, he couldn’t stay away. “I wanted to work six, seven, eight hours a day. And I’d call and talk to Judy,” he laughs. “Judy would say, ‘Well, the students don’t work that much.’”  On Wednesday, Reynolds joined the rest of the graduating class from Adult High School and finally crossed the stage he’d been dreaming of for so long. In true grandfather fashion, his focus turns instead to bragging about his grandson Andrew, who is graduating from Clarksville High School. “We took our senior pictures, not all together, but you know, at the same time,” he says proudly.  Reynolds hopes his experience will encourage others to embrace challenges and push through their struggle. “The kids that are coming to Adult High School and (traditional high schools), especially in the last two or three years.

"accident","2023-05-17","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-26T18:44:30","A 6-year-old in Virginia is receiving loads of support from her community after being involved in a tragic accident that resulted in her losing both her feet.  Aubrey Scaletta was playing with a ratchet strap in the passenger seat of a pickup truck on May 17, when one end of the strap went out the window and wrapped itself around the drive shaft.  In a tragic turn of events, the other end of the strap became wrapped around Aubrey’s feet and as the strap quickly tightened, her feet were severed, according to the Virginia State Police Association.  The young girl was then airlifted to a hospital where she underwent a six-hour surgery and will possibly face more in an attempt to repair her injuries, said the police.  Doctors were able to reattach her severed feet, according to WSLS. The 6-year-old is stable but still has a long road ahead of her, her mother, Lauren Scaletta, said in a Facebook post.  “The injuries are horrible and painful for all involved. Aubrey, Aubrey’s sister and Aubrey's parents are having a real hard time coping with this painful tragedy. They need our love and they need our help financially,” the VSPA said.  In an update from the family on their GoFundMe page on Thursday, they said Aubrey has been taken off the ventilator and is now breathing on her own. They also are hopeful she will be moved from the ICU to the pediatric floor over the weekend if all goes well, said the update.  “This has been both the longest and shortest days of our lives. We have held our breath and moved hour by hour most of the time we have been in the PICU,” said the family. “Everyone has done their very best to take care of our girl and we couldn’t imagine being anywhere else.”  Aubrey's next scheduled surgery is on June 9, and the hope is to be able to leave the hospital by the end of June, said the update.  After leaving the hospital, Aubrey will then have physical therapy at home and the goal is to have her walking again, with the help of braces and walkers, by Christmas, according to the family.  “This is going to be a very long, winding road for us. She has already gotten a fan club here at the hospital with her dancing and smiles. Her spunk is very evident with her displeasure of the ventilator and legs being kept down,” said Lauren in a Facebook post. “The love everyone has show has been tremendous. We are beyond blessed. We can’t thank you enough!”  Related Stories","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc2lkZWVkaXRpb24uY29tL3ZpcmdpbmlhLTYteWVhci1vbGQtcmVtYWlucy1pbi1ob3NwaXRhbC1hZnRlci1hLWZyZWFrLWFjY2lkZW50LXNldmVycy1ib3RoLWhlci1mZWV0LTgxNjkw0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5zaWRlZWRpdGlvbi5jb20vdmlyZ2luaWEtNi15ZWFyLW9sZC1yZW1haW5zLWluLWhvc3BpdGFsLWFmdGVyLWEtZnJlYWstYWNjaWRlbnQtc2V2ZXJzLWJvdGgtaGVyLWZlZXQtODE2OTA_YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"accident","2023-05-26","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-26T15:05:52","May 26, 2023  Heart pounding, hands trembling, you've just found yourself in an accident caused by another party's negligence.  Or, sadly, perhaps you are facing even more significant personal injuries. What you do next could make all the difference in your recovery journey, and seeking fair compensation if you or someone you loved were injured. To assist you in this process, we've compiled a list of recommended actions to take following a car crash:  Remember your ABCs: Assess, Be safe, and Call for help. Although every accident is unique, evaluating the severity of injuries and ensuring everyone's safety should be the first step. It is crucial to remain vigilant, as inattentive drivers may cause further harm. Therefore, act swiftly to avoid any additional danger. Then, call 911 immediately for help if necessary.  Get the medical care you need. In the aftermath of a car accident, seeking medical care is an absolute must. DON'T DELAY. It ensures the proper treatment for any immediate injuries and protects you from potential insurance denials down the road because of a delay or gap in medical treatment. Additionally, some injuries, such as certain types of head trauma, aren't always apparent right after an accident. It's important to stay vigilant for any symptoms that may arise later on and to communicate all your problems to your medical providers.  Use Your Health Insurance. It's easy to assume that the other driver's insurance should pay your medical bills, but that won't always happen in the short-term. That's why we advise our clients to use their health insurance to cover their medical expenses. Doing so will prevent medical bills from piling up while you wait for the at-fault insurance company to pay out. Plus, using your health insurance immediately gives you access to the medical care you need. This is particularly true when it may be months—or in extreme cases, years—before a personal injury case is resolved with the at-fault driver's insurance company and all damages are paid.  Report the Accident to the Appropriate Car Insurance Companies. You'll want to contact your insurance company and the at-fault driver's insurance company. While the at-fault driver's insurer is responsible for covering any damages, your insurer could also have certain types of coverage that could help you out, such as medical payments or uninsured motorist (UIM) coverage. Plus, if the other driver's insurer is slow or unresponsive, your insurer could cover your property damage without meaningfully affecting your premium, since your insurance company will seek reimbursement from the other driver's insurance company. It is advisable not to agree to provide a ""recorded statement"" to insurance companies regarding the accident's cause or disclose specifics about your injuries and medical treatment before speaking to a lawyer. Instead, limit the conversation to reporting the accident and initiating the process of addressing the property damage claim. If you decide to hire a personal injury attorney, they then can help communicate relevant information to the insurance company, preventing any misinterpretation or distortion of your statement. It is essential to know that other insurance companies may be involved in an accident, especially in cases where the at-fault driver was driving someone else's vehicle or was on the job. In such situations, seeking the help of an experienced personal injury attorney can prove crucial. They can identify additional sources of insurance coverage, including additional liability policies or underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage, which can be a significant advantage. Thus, enlisting the services of an experienced personal injury attorney can prove highly beneficial.  Address Your Property Damage Claim. If your injuries do not impede your driving ability, you will need a vehicle. If your car has been totaled, a new one must be purchased. Liability insurance typically will cover the costs if repairs amount to less than 75% of the vehicle's fair market value. If substantial damage is sustained, but repairs are made, the vehicle's resale value may decrease, and insurance may also cover this damage. Individuals can typically handle property damage claims without legal representation. Property damage claims can be resolved without affecting personal injury claims. However, most personal injury attorneys will assist with property damage claims at no additional cost.  Document everything. If you can do so safely, take pictures of the accident scene, property damage, and visible injuries. Additionally, it is important to document insurance information, license plate numbers, and the name of the attending law enforcement officer. This information will serve as valuable resources for your personal injury attorney. Retain all documents associated with your medical treatment, including bills and initial records, as well as keep a record of time missed from work and any out-of-pocket expenses incurred because of the accident. These expenses should be compensable as part of your claim. Engaging an attorney can aid in managing this process. However, maintaining basic documentation of the events and their effects on your life will prove beneficial.  Speak to an attorney early. A skilled personal injury lawyer can assist you in navigating the legal system and safeguarding your rights. They can provide you with answers to your questions, assess any potential claims you may have against the other driver, and negotiate with insurance companies on your behalf to make sure you receive appropriate compensation. If needed, an experienced lawyer can file your case and represent you in court, including a trial by jury.  Following these steps can help protect your legal rights and ensure you receive proper care after a car accident caused by someone else's negligence. If you have any concerns regarding your rights and responsibilities, contact an experienced personal injury attorney as soon as possible, and we're here to help.

"accident","2023-05-21","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-27T00:42:00","Public safety officials are advising river users to take extra precautions during high spring run-off after a local resident from Vail fell from a raft and drowned while boating on the Colorado River in Glenwood Canyon on Sunday, May 21.  Nicholas Courtens, 34, was rafting with four others in a private group with two boats.  The group was running the stretch of river between the Shoshone power plant and Grizzly Creek.  The run is known as “Shoshone,” and it can feature challenging whitewater when river levels are high.  According to Glenwood Springs Fire Department officials who helped respond to the incident, Courtens and another man fell off their raft about halfway through navigating the rapids.  Rafters in the second boat were eventually able to get them to the side of the river and begin resuscitation efforts, with the help of two bystanders, before responders arrived.  “When our paramedics arrived on-scene bystanders were doing CPR and an automated external defibrillator had already been attached,” said Glenwood Springs Deputy Fire Chief Douglas Gerrald. “We performed advanced life support for about another 20 minutes prior to making the decision with a medical consult to cease resuscitation efforts.”  The other rafter who fell into the river survived the incident, but Courtens was pronounced dead at the site. He was wearing a life jacket and a helmet.  Brent Gardner-Smith / Aspen Public Radio An unidentified kayaker enjoys the wave on the Colorado River in West Glenwood Springs on Sunday, May 21. The river at this location was flowing at 10,600 cfs that day, with a good deal of intensity from spring run-off. Upriver, about 6,700 cfs of water was flowing through the Shoshone section.  Local rivers see above average spring run-off  According to the Roaring Fork Conservancy ( RFC ), which last collected run-off data from the USGS stream gauges on Thursday, May 25, local river levels are flowing high due to above average snowpack and warming spring temperatures.  “Most of the rivers across the Roaring Fork watershed are flowing from 108 to 207% of average,” said RFC Director of Community Outreach Christina Medved.  While this level of spring run-off isn’t unprecedented, it’s certainly notable.  “As an example, the Crystal River at the hatchery is flowing double what it would normally flow this time of the year, which is pretty impressive,” Medved said.  On mid-day Sunday, the day of the fatal accident in the Shoshone section of the Colorado River, the flow there was about 6,700 cfs, or cubic feet per second.  According to several local rafting companies in the area, that’s about 700 cfs above the river level that most commercial operations will run the Shoshone section.  “We are running trips on the Colorado in Glenwood Canyon, but with current water levels we are putting in below the Shoshone section at Grizzly Creek,” said Gregory Cowan, the owner of Defiance Rafting Company in Glenwood Springs.  According to Cowan, many commercial operations in the area are more conservative in their decision-making than private groups or experienced individuals when it comes to running whitewater.  “Certainly speaking for Defiance and I think a lot of other local outfitters, it's more of that multi-generational family, first-time rafter orientation,” he said. “We all tend to hedge a little bit more on wanting to make sure people are out there having a positive experience when they're on the water.”  Eleanor Bennett / Aspen Public Radio Unusually high water floods the boat ramp at the Shoshone put-in on the Colorado River on Sunday, May 21, the same day as the fatal rafting accident. The Shoshone run can feature challenging whitewater when river levels are high.  Public safety officials warn of danger on the river  In the wake of Sunday’s fatal accident, public safety officials are reminding river users that the high run-off this spring can be dangerous, even for experienced boaters.  In a press release sent out by the Garfield County Sheriff’s Office on Monday, May 22, Garfield County Emergency Manager Chris Bornholdt addressed the accident and expressed his concerns over river safety.  “Water levels are predicted to come up even more in the next couple weeks and stay at a high level for over a month,” he said. “Navigating the river is tricky under normal conditions and when you add 3 to 4 times the amount of water and speed, things can happen really fast.”  Pitkin County Emergency Manager Valerie McDonald said her agency has also been working to get the word out to the public about the importance of river safety.  “We had a fabulous ski season last year and the flip side of that is there's a lot of snow still up there that has yet to come down,” she said. “We hope for a long, slow and sustained runoff, but based on the numbers we're seeing up there, we have to prepare for the worst.”  If someone does fall into the river, it’s up to local public safety officials like Roaring Fork Fire Rescue Chief Scott Thompson and his team to try and rescue them.  “Each fire department in the valley has a swift-water rescue team or team members,” Thompson said. “We established these rescue teams in the 1990s, and unfortunately it was born because there was a need.”  Thompson was one of the original swift-water rescue technicians in the valley and has been involved in most of the swift-water rescues or incidents in the valley over the last 40 years.  “Most of the fatalities that we have are on the Roaring Fork or the Crystal River,” he said. “It seems like every year we experience one or two, and then some years are worse.”  Eleanor Bennett / Aspen Public Radio Two unidentified kayakers paddle down the Slaughterhouse whitewater run on the Roaring Fork River just outside of Aspen on Friday, May 26. According to local public safety officials, most of the river fatalities in the valley happen on either the Roaring Fork or the Crystal River.  Swift-water rescue veteran offers safety tips  One of the most common issues Thompson has witnessed over the decades is people not being prepared or exceeding their capabilities.  “You have to have a tremendous amount of training and knowledge to get into swiftwater,” he said. “I'm not talking about the flat water east of Aspen, you know, I'm talking about whitewater in the rapids — especially in areas you don't know about.”  Another common pitfall Thompson has observed is people not scouting their route ahead of time — something he advises doing even for those who might be familiar with a particular stretch of river.  “They don't find where the trees are down across the river or where we have fences coming in the river with high water,” he said. “There are trees that are dangling over the rivers right now, the roots are giving out, being washed out, and it's certainly gonna get worse in the next two or three weeks.”  Rivers can also change form and shape, which can impact how a rapid behaves.  In the case of Shoshone where the recent fatality occurred, a large mudslide in 2021, upriver of Shoshone, appears to some boaters to have changed that section of the Colorado River, which could come as a surprise to an unsuspecting rafter.  According to Thompson, there are a lot of things that can go wrong when navigating fast-flowing rivers, even for the most experienced of boaters.  “We've had some kayakers that I knew personally that had vast years of experience and they made a mistake and unfortunately it was a fatal mistake,” he said. “It's risky business being on whitewater.”  While swift-water rescue members like Thompson and other public safety officials do their best to help people who find themselves in a tricky or even life-threatening situation, individuals who head out on the water are ultimately doing so at their own risk.  “In rescue situations, before we get in the water, we always look at the risk versus benefit and what's the least risky for us because certainly we don't wanna get hurt or killed affecting a rescue,” Thompson said. “I don’t know that it’s possible to change that human behavior for somebody that wants to take that risk, that physical high of conquering a rapid.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hc3BlbnB1YmxpY3JhZGlvLm9yZy9vdXRkb29ycy8yMDIzLTA1LTI2L2xvY2FsLXNhZmV0eS1vZmZpY2lhbHMtd2Fybi1yaXZlci11c2Vycy1hYm91dC1kYW5nZXJzLW9mLWhpZ2gtc3ByaW5nLXJ1bi1vZmYtYWZ0ZXItZmF0YWwtcmFmdGluZy1hY2NpZGVudNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Use Next and Previous buttons to navigate  The death of a 63-year-old Stamford man who went missing late last year and was found dead in a Westport pond in April has been ruled an accident, according to the state Office of the Chief Medical Examiner.  Chief Medical Examiner James Gill said Errol Whyte died of drowning.  Westport Lt. Eric Woods said the department is still investigating Whyte's death, ""but we do not have any evidence to believe this is anything but an unfortunate accident.""  ""I cannot go into why we believe it was an accident, but suffice it to say, there is no evidence to suggest anything otherwise,"" Woods said in an email Friday.  Stamford police initially labeled Whyte's disappearance as ""suspicious."" He was last seen driving his red 2002 Ford Explorer in Bridgeport, headed home, around 6:30 p.m. on Dec. 29, according to Stamford police Capt. Deidrich Hohn at the time.  Family members reported him missing two days later after his SUV was found abandoned on the shoulder of Interstate 95 South near Exit 17 in Westport. His keys, cellphones and wallet were discovered in the car, but his driver's license and cash were missing from his wallet, police said.  Whyte wasn't found until months later. On April 3, Westport police officers were called to an office complex on Greens Farms Road for the report of a body floating in a retention pond about a mile away from where his SUV was found.  Based on the condition of Whyte's body, it appeared to have been in the water for some time, according to Woods in April.  There are still many unanswered questions regarding Whyte's death, such as how he ended up in a pond.  Woods added Friday that he could not comment on specifics of the case but noted that there had been no sightings of Whyte from when his vehicle was found on the highway to when his body was recovered.  Whyte's family declined to comment Friday.

"accident","2023-05-25","12:00:00","Not Discerned","2023-05-26T07:51:56","Ebensburg, PA (May 25, 2023) – Authorities said a man was killed, and three others, including two Cambria County deputies, were wounded in a crash involving a tri-axle truck in the Ebensburg area on Thursday afternoon, May 25th.  According to Cambria County Coroner Jeffrey Lees, the collision happened in the area of U.S. Highway 22 and South Center Street in Cambria Township.  Just after 12:00 p.m., a westbound tri-axle truck collided with an SUV that was turning left from South Center Street into Route 22. Lees said two deputies were hurt when the truck crossed the center line after hitting the SUV and slammed into their patrol car in the eastern lane of Route 22.  The SUV driver, a man in his 70s, was dead at the scene. A passenger in the SUV was taken to Johnstown’s Conemaugh Memorial Medical Center with serious injuries, along with the two Cambria County deputies.  Police from Cambria Township, Pennsylvania, are looking into the collision, and they’ve called in assistance from the Pennsylvania State Police to help them piece together what happened. It’s unclear if citations or charges will be filed at this time.  Our deepest condolences go out to the deceased man’s family. Our thoughts are with the injured victims in hopes of their full recovery.  Deadly Vehicle Crashes in Pennsylvania  In just one recent year, rear-end collisions were the second most common accident involving at least two or more Pennsylvania drivers. Needless to say, every motorist should be extra cautious on Pennsylvania’s highways, where more than 20,000 incidents involving several cars occur each year in the Pennsylvania Commonwealth.  What’s more, reckless or careless driving nearly always leads to these collisions. Drivers that disobey the rules of the road, such as stop signs, are the main cause of rear-end collisions in Pennsylvania. In some circumstances, it is clear who is at blame in a rear-end collision, but in others, the events leading up to the crash aren’t quite as obvious.  When another vehicle strikes you from behind, the degree of your injuries is primarily determined by the other vehicle’s speed at the time of contact. The majority of rear-end collisions occur when one motorist suddenly brakes, causing the vehicle behind them to slam into them.  Still, catastrophic injuries may occur even when fender benders occur at modest speeds. For example, the seat reclines automatically when the seat belt is fastened. If you hit your seat or headrest while driving too fast for current conditions, it might have severe consequences, some of which may not manifest for hours or days.  But if you were not at fault for an accident in which you sustained significant injuries, it’s important to contact an attorney immediately. Even if a vehicle accident victim is permanently incapacitated as a consequence of their injuries, an insurance company may hunt for loopholes to avoid paying for long-term care or lost income and earning potential.  Thankfully, our seasoned team at Spear Greenfield will assist you in and out of court, whether in Philadelphia or elsewhere in Pennsylvania, to settle your losses from an accident that’s taken place through no fault of your own. If you or a loved one has been injured in a vehicle accident in Pennsylvania, call us at (215) 600-0681. We will connect you with our attorneys, who are knowledgeable in Pennsylvania law.

(Dakota News Now) - Memorial Day weekend travel is back to full strength after the last three years dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. But that means more folks on the road, and a higher risk for accidents.  “A lot of traffic that’s going to be on the road this weekend. We just want it to be an incredibly fun and festive weekend, and do so without any major crashes or anything like that,” Sioux Falls Police Department Lt. Andrew Seibenborn said.  South Dakota as a whole sits on the higher end when it comes to Memorial Day fatal accidents.  A new study from car insurance savings app Jerry shows that the Mount Rushmore state has the second most fatal accidents per capita during the holiday weekend, behind West Virginia and ahead of third-most North Dakota. On an average Memorial Day Weekend, over two South Dakotans out of 100 thousand people will die in a traffic accident.  Alcohol was also involved in 61 percent of all fatal crashes when a BAC test was conducted.  AAA Public & Government Affairs Manager Rylie Mansuetti said the holiday weekend also kicks off the deadliest time of the year for teenage drivers nationwide.  “Memorial Day kicks off the 100 deadliest days of summer for teen drivers. They are out on the roads more. We see an increase overall in drivers of all ages with impaired driving or distracted driving during this time of year,” Mansuetti said.  Mansuetti said peer pressure can work both ways, and says stepping in to stop someone from getting behind the wheel if they’ve been drinking could save a life.  “So we really urge drivers to think twice before driving impaired, before drinking and driving. Always have a plan in place if you do decide to partake in those activities. Also, that extends to drugs as well, even if they’re legal and prescribed to you, or other substances,” Mansuetti said. “If you see someone that is impared, and they are about to get behind the wheel, it is cool and it is okay to tell them that it’s not a smart idea to drive right now and to find an alternative solution.”  Copyright 2023 KSFY.

The Zaporizhzhia plant, which lies in an area of Russian-occupied southern Ukraine, is Europe's biggest nuclear power station and the area has been repeatedly hit by shelling that both sides blame each other for.  The defence ministry's intelligence directorate said Russian forces would soon shell the plant and then announce a radiation leak. This would force an investigation by international authorities, during which all hostilities would be stopped.  The directorate statement, posted on Telegram, did not provide any proof. It said Russia had disrupted the planned rotation of inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, who are based at the plant.  The Vienna-based IAEA, which frequently posts updates on the plant, has made no mention of any disruption.  Last week witnesses said Russian military forces had been enhancing defensive positions in and around the plant ahead of the counter-offensive.  In October 2022, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged the West to warn Russia not to blow up a dam that would flood a large area. The dam was not destroyed.  In February, Russia said Ukraine was planning to stage a nuclear incident on its territory to pin the blame on Moscow.  Russia has repeatedly accused Kyiv of planning ""false flag"" operations with non-conventional weapons, using biological or radioactive materials. No such attack has materialised.

(KFOR) – On Friday, the Oklahoma band, CLIFFDIVER was supposed to perform at an event in Las Vegas. But instead, they find themselves visiting their bass player in the hospital after a terrifying freak accident.  “It was the luckiest unlucky thing to ever happen to anybody,” said Joey Duffy, one of the lead singers of the Tulsa-based band. “All five of us should be dead right now.”  Duffy told KFOR on Tuesday, five of the band’s seven members were headed west in their brand-new tour van for a gig scheduled for Friday. The other two members were going to catch up with them later in the week.  Images courtesy of CLIFFDIVER Images courtesy of CLIFFDIVER Images courtesy of CLIFFDIVER  They were driving on I-44 near Stroud when they heard “an enormous boom sound that sounded like a cannon being fired.”  “The driver’s window kind of just exploded,” said Duffy.  As glass and dust filled the air, the band was horrified to see Tyler, their bass player who was driving at the time, unconscious and covered in blood.  “We thought he was shot,” said Duffy. “We jumped into action. Our drummer grabbed the wheel for a second to keep it straight. And then our guitarist, Matt, was in the seat behind him. He was able to get up to the front and get his foot off the accelerator because we were speeding up to about 80 at that point.”  Duffy said within minutes, that felt like an eternity, they safely pulled over near mile marker 178 and called 911.  Eventually, the band was informed a steel chain link was lodged in Tyler’s neck.  “The only logical thing is someone going the other way had a giant load on the back of a truck that was pressure, you know, strapped down by these big chains and something happened to one of the chains and just that one chain link snapped and just shot straight over directly into Tyler,” said Duffy.  According to Duffy, Tyler lost two liters of blood, spent 19 hours in the ICU and underwent a surgery. Miraculously, he’s doing okay and was walking on Friday.  “He’s doing better. He had surgery and they’re looking to discharge him in the next couple of days,” said Duffy. “It’s unbelievable. He’s a warrior.” However, Duffy says Tyler’s not out of the woods yet and likely has a long road to recovery ahead of him.

"accident","2023-05-26","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-26T12:20:46","Accident spurs Kennesaw State student to research  KENNESAW, Ga. | May 26, 2023  In one moment, Heru Crooks’ life trajectory changed when he was seriously injured in a car crash in 2016.  Crooks, who graduated from high school at age 16, had planned on taking a little time off, maybe a gap year or two to work and pursue some other passions, before going to college to study something in the sciences. But that all changed when the car he was riding in flipped over on Interstate 75 and the impact left him paralyzed from the navel down.  Crooks, now a Kennesaw State University sophomore, says it was that unfortunate turn of events that actually gave him the clarity to see his future as a scientist studying stem cell treatments — the same treatments that helped him recover sooner than his doctors expected after the accident. Heru Crooks  “I want to know things, in this case why those treatments worked for me,” he said. “So I figure KSU is the best place for me to find out how they worked, and to discover even better treatments.”  Crooks said he underwent eight surgeries in the three days immediately after the accident, and then endured several months of intense physical therapy at Atlanta’s Shepherd Center, a world-renowned rehabilitation center. He was told that he was paralyzed and would spend the rest of his life using a wheelchair.  “I've always had an affinity toward science, life, the universe, but definitely my incident sparked supreme interest in the sciences,” he said. “Of course, from having this particular injury, my interest in the human nervous system and neurology just expanded greatly. Everything that could offer any idea about the human nervous system just sparked my interest.”  Crooks said his father was his biggest champion. Three months after the accident, the two went to Panama for one course of syncopal stem cell therapy, which incorporates stem cells from discarded umbilical cords as well as cells from the patient’s own bone marrow. Crooks said he regained some ability to control parts of his body, as well as lessened dependence on medication, through these therapies.  Later, they traveled to India for a more aggressive course of stem cell treatments, this one focused on regenerating nerves in the spinal cord. That helped Crooks get back on his feet. He said he walked a short distance with a walker and leg braces within two years of the accident, which impressed his team of doctors.  All the while, Crooks said he read anything and everything on the various treatments and therapies he experienced. Four years after the accident, he had a greater desire to learn, and decided it was time to go to college. He chose Kennesaw State for its proximity to his family in Tucker, Ga. and its affordability, but he soon discovered a campus with myriad opportunities for a curious future scientist.  Perhaps the most important opportunity was the one he found with professor of biology Martin Hudson, whose research focuses on nervous system formation and disorders. Crooks said his interest in biotechnology best reflected Hudson’s research into neurologic pathology.  “I want to be part of that new biotechnology wave and help cure myself and help cure others,” Crooks said. “The classes I took initially were good, but I wanted something more in-depth. Dr. Hudson's lab caught my eye because his research focused on neuroscience that took in science and genetics, which were my two favorite things, so it just seemed like a match.”  Hudson researches how the nervous system forms and the pathologies that take hold when the process goes awry, by studying a transparent microscopic worm called a nematode. He said bright, curious students join his laboratory group yearly, but few with the desire to research deep scientific topics on their own time as Crooks does.  “He’s got a story, but the most important thing to me is he wants to be a scientist, and I can help train him inclusively,” Hudson said. “Finding someone that is instantly engaged is uncommon, like he’s taking notes and filing things away before you even prompt him to do so—an innate curiosity. He’s been a major asset to our research team.”  Hudson added a lower table to one of the lab stations and worked with his equipment supplier to adapt a microscope to Crooks’ eye level. Crooks said he appreciated Hudson’s efforts and has responded by diving headlong into undergraduate research.  Crooks will spend the summer doing research through the Undergraduate Research Training Initiative for Student Enhancement (U-RISE) program, funded through the National Institutes of Health and dedicated to uplifting undergraduate researchers from underserved communities interested in pursuing doctoral degrees in biomedical sciences. When he earns his bachelor’s in biochemistry in 2025, Crooks plans to do just that.

"accident","2023-05-24","15:38:00","Not Discerned","2023-05-26T19:05:34","by Dennis Dalman  news@thenewsleaders.com  Many people in a central Sartell neighborhood think it was an “accident waiting to happen” that severely injured 10-year-old Thomas Zimmerman on the afternoon of May 24.  It happened at 3:38 p.m. on Fifth Street near Pine Meadow Elementary School when a car and the bicycle Zimmerman was riding collided, knocking the boy from his bike, causing his face and head to collide with great force against the curb.  The other bikers were not injured.  Thomas, unconscious at first, was rushed by ambulance to the St. Cloud Hospital. He was then transferred to Children’s Hospital in Minneapolis. He underwent several reconstructive surgeries to repair facial damage that included his jaw broken in two places, a broken nose, a gash, lacerations and nine broken or knocked-out teeth. Fortunately, he is recovering well and should be back home soon, said his mother, Abby Fann during an interview May 26 with the Newsleader. The interview was conducted during a phone call while Fann was outside of Thomas’s room at Children’s Hospital. Taylor Zimmerman, Fann’s first husband and Thomas’s father, is also at his son’s side in the hospital.  Thomas had just left for the day at Riverview Intermediate School, returned home and decided to bike with friends on the bike path that leads to a marked crossing on Fifth Street. They were on their way to meet up with another group of friends right across that street at the Pine Meadow school’s playground.  The collision occurred at the crossing. The car’s driver was a 16-year-old boy who lives in that same neighborhood. The bike riders came off of the path into the crossing so fast the car driver didn’t see them or react in time. The young car driver was devastated, as were his parents. While driving, the boy was not speeding, not distracted and not impaired in any way.  The accident happened not far from Thomas’s backyard.  Terrible shock  Thomas’s mother first learned of the awful accident from her family’s babysitter, who was one of the friends in the group of friends Thomas and the others were on their way to meet.  The girl, who had witnessed the accident from the school grounds, immediately called Thomas’ mother. She and some others, terrified by anxiety and fear, rushed to the hospital, not knowing what to expect. Though the injuries were terrible to see, they were vastly relieved to know they were not life-threatening.  Please be cautious  The next day, Abby Fann, put three photos of her injured son on her Facebook account as a visual reminder for all drivers and bicyclists to be extra vigilant and cautious at all times, especially near crosswalks and schools.  Under the three photos on Facebook, Fann posted these words: “PLEASE. I am begging everyone to be cautious and diligent about watching for pedestrians and bicyclists now that the weather is nice.”  She then listed Thomas’s injuries, followed by “It is the LAW to yield to pedestrians in a crosswalk. Save a life.”  Fann said she is not blaming the 16-year-old car driver. Not in the least.  “It was an ‘honest’ accident,” she said. “The boy was not distracted, he was not drinking or impaired or speeding. That boy lives right in this neighborhood, and his parents have been just great to us since the accident. They and their boy feel so bad about it.”  What Fann does blame is the bike trail where it meets the road. Like many others who live in that neighborhood, she has long been worried about how there are shrubs and trees where the trail meets the crosswalk, making it difficult for motorists to see who is on that path until almost the very moment when a pedestrian or biker enters the road at the crossing.  “It was an accident waiting to happen,” Fann said.  Some safety tips she advises are making sure kids wear helmets when biking, drivers should slow down and look carefully both ways, preparing to brake if needed, and always be vigilant for the unexpected.  Recovery  Thomas’s family – mother, father, stepfather Robert Fann, an older daughter and younger son – are all eager to see him recover.  “He can move his legs and feet so we know he’ll be able to walk again,” his mother said.  Abby Fann is a 2011 Sartell High School graduate who works for CentraCare as a scribe (transcriber).  Thomas’s siblings are Evelyn, 12; and Carter, 6.  “Thomas has always been so full of energy,” said his mother. “He loves to be with friends, he loves to bike and he just loves to fish. He has a great peer group, enjoys football. He’s such a good kid!”  Get well  A GoFundMe page was set up by Abby Fann’s brother, Thomas’s uncle, to help the family cover medical expenses for Thomas.

The boy’s parents were called and took the child to the hospital, where a scan revealed that the youngest actually had a small caliber bullet lodged in his head, the Spanish Fork Police Department explained in a press release on Tuesday.  At the time, police classified the incident as a “tragic accident.”  On Wednesday, the SFPD announced that investigators identified a man who was shooting birds with a .22 caliber air rifle just west of the daycare when the bizarre injury occurred.  The man is cooperating, the department confirmed, and his name will not be released unless formal charges are filed.  The incident took place at Leap Ahead Daycare in Spanish Fork on Monday. AP  As of Wednesday, the boy remains in stable condition at Primary Children’s Medical Center in Salt Lake City. Doctors decided against removing the bullet due to concerns that surgery would cause further damage, KSL-TV reported.  “I still feel like I’m in shock,” Lane Mugleston, who owns Leap Ahead Daycare with his wife, told the outlet.  “We are absolutely surprised.

But don't worry, lads. The man, from Tanzania, has since fully recovered from his horror injury.  Medics who were called to the hellish accident as an 'extremely rare urological emergency' had to operate on his poor penis to patch up the problem.  Doctors detailed the man's doodle dilemma in the International Journal of Surgery Case Reports.  Advert 10  In the journal, health officials said the anonymous patient attended hospital with a swollen penis, complaining he was in pain and had been bleeding from his urethra for five hours. Yikes.  This tomato looks like a doodle. Credit: GLC Pix / Alamy  Doctors wrote that his penis 'slipped out, lost [its] way and hit the female perineal area as he was trying to re-insert it'.  The man lost his erection rather quickly - as you would - and was in agony.  Advert 10  He later trotted off to a nearby health centre, where he was given painkillers, and was then referred to Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre.  Dr Bartholomeo Nicholaus Ngowi and his team of urologists at the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre reported the man's penis was 'a bit twisted'.  They also claimed it had ballooned in size and was covered in blood.  Yikes, yikes, yikes.  Advert 10  Anyway, an ultrasound revealed he had broken a blood vessel in the corpora cavernosa.  For the record, there are two spongy tubes inside the penis - the corpora cavernosa - that fill up with blood and harden, creating an erection.  Credit: Roman Lacheev / Alamy  An MRI follow-up showed the man had a tear from left to right through the tunica albuginea, corpora carvenosa and corpus spongiosum.  Advert 10  So, erectile tissue.  There was also a partial tear through the urethra and swelling from the stress of the injury.  Despite an erection being nicknamed 'a boner' there are no bones in the penis.  However, these sorts of injuries are still referred to as a penis 'fracture' by medical professionals.  Advert 10  The man was rushed into surgery, in which a urologist degloved his penis (do NOT Google that, fellas) and repaired the fracture by stitching up the corpora cavernosum, the urethra, and the corpus spongiosum.  So a triple fracture. He was discharged from hospital three days later.  The man with the decimated doodle did see doctors again six months after the injury, and reported he was having sex again - though hopefully not in whatever position had caused the initial injury - and his penis function had returned to normal.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhZGJpYmxlLmNvbS9uZXdzL21hbi1zbmFwcy1oaXMtcGVuaXMtaW4tdGhyZWUtcGxhY2VzLWFmdGVyLWhvcnJvci1iZWRyb29tLWFjY2lkZW50LTI0MTE3NS0yMDIzMDUyNtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Zübeyr Topal, 41, who started working as a truck driver after his dismissal from the civil service, was involved in a traffic accident on Tuesday in northeastern Artvin province. The father of two was on his way to Ardahan when his truck plunged into the Çoruh River. Rescue teams have been searching for his body since the accident to no avail.  According to the search teams, Topal’s body most likely drifted downriver.  Topal’s place of employment before his dismissal was not disclosed to the media.  Turkey’s Justice and Development Party (AKP) government declared a state of emergency (OHAL) following the abortive putsch on July 15, 2016 that remained in effect until July 19, 2018. During the state of emergency the AKP carried out a purge of state institutions under the pretext of an anti-coup fight by issuing a number of government decrees, known as KHKs, firing 130,000 civil servants from their jobs due to their real or alleged connections to “terrorist organizations.”  Turkey’s former public servants were not only fired from their jobs; they were also prohibited from working again in the public sector and getting a passport. The government also made it difficult for them to work formally in the private sector. Notes were put on the social security database about dismissed public servants to deter potential employers.  Therefore, many purge victims have had to work in uninsured jobs with very little workplace safety. There have also been cases where former public servants have died due to occupational accidents in physically demanding jobs.  Former public servants, such as judges and military officers, have taken to social media to reveal they were working in neighborhood street markets and at construction sites.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vc3RvY2tob2xtY2Yub3JnL2Zvcm1lci1wdWJsaWMtc2VydmFudC1iZWxpZXZlZC10by1oYXZlLWRpZWQtaW4td29yay1yZWxhdGVkLWFjY2lkZW50L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The number of people who lost their lives in accidents in 2021 was 5,362, while 274,615 others sustained injuries, according to official data.  The data provided by Turkstat also points to the reason behind the vast majority of the fatal accidents being drivers with 44.9%, whereas in 31.8% of the cases other passengers were held responsible, and in 23.3% of the accidents pedestrians were considered responsible.  The data also shed light based on gender, thus it was found that men made up a larger share of both fatalities and injuries with 76.7% and 69.4%, respectively.  According to the analysis of some 235,176 accidents that ended up either with fatalities or injuries, the statistical agency revealed that drivers were held accountable in 86.8% of the cases, while pedestrians were considered responsible in 9.5% of the cases.  Additionally, it was revealed that 66.9% out of approximately 197,261 incidents that occurred on the highways and claimed lives or left injuries took place during the day.  When the accidents and their consequences are evaluated according to the number of vehicles, 50.1% of the accidents that occurred in 2022 included two vehicles, 44.3% of them were with a single vehicle, and 5.6% were multi-vehicle accidents.  The highest number of fatal accidents took place in the month of August at 10%, and the least in February with 5.8%, the data highlighted.

Lack of focus on infrastructural designs when it comes to roads is also one of the reasons that the number of accidents that occur in India is on an exponential rise.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZWNjYW5oZXJhbGQuY29tL25hdGlvbmFsL25vcnRoLWFuZC1jZW50cmFsL2RlbGhpLXRlZW4tZGllcy1pbi1hbi1hY2NpZGVudC1hcy1sYWNrLW9mLXNpZ25hbC1pbnNpZGUtdHVubmVsLWRlbGF5cy1zb3MtMTIyMTgzMC5odG1s0gGSAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlY2NhbmhlcmFsZC5jb20vYW1wL25hdGlvbmFsL25vcnRoLWFuZC1jZW50cmFsL2RlbGhpLXRlZW4tZGllcy1pbi1hbi1hY2NpZGVudC1hcy1sYWNrLW9mLXNpZ25hbC1pbnNpZGUtdHVubmVsLWRlbGF5cy1zb3MtMTIyMTgzMC5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"accident","2023-05-19","22:15:00","{""Oakland"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-25T20:21:24","Car Accident on Church Street in Oakland  A driver was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence in a car accident that left four others injured, including one in grave condition, on Church Street in Oakland. According to officials, the motor vehicle collision occurred on May 19, 2023, at approximately 10:15 p.m. at the intersection of Church Street and Foothill Boulevard.  Details on the Car Accident on Church Street in Oakland  According to the Oakland Police Department, alcohol played a role in this car accident. The motorist, who was under the influence, suffered injuries described as non-life-threatening. Two passengers in the driver’s vehicle also sustained injuries, officials said. The other vehicle’s driver was also injured, and their passenger was last reported in grave condition.  Officials have not yet released the name of the passenger in grave condition until their relatives have been notified. Information on other charges the alleged drunk driver is facing has not yet been released by Oakland PD. An investigation into the car accident at Church Street and Foothill Boulevard in Oakland is ongoing by authorities.  Financial Recovery for a Car Accident Caused by a DUI Driver  Getting injured in a motor vehicle collision through no fault of your own can be traumatic and life-changing. It may be even more stressful to overcome if the motorist who caused the car wreck was under the influence of alcohol or drugs. If a recent auto accident has left you struggling to recover and unsure of how to proceed in your situation, you need all the support you can get – physically, emotionally, and financially. Filing a bodily injury claim against the at-fault party and their insurance company is essential to obtaining the financial recovery you need to get your life back on track.  Eligible claimants may seek reimbursement for economic and non-economic damages in an injury case. These generally include pain and suffering, wage loss, medical costs, and other losses in connection with the incident and the resulting injuries. If a motor vehicle collision causes injury to more than one party, there may be a concern regarding liability coverage limits for claimants. When in such situations, it is helpful to fall back on your uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage. This will help pay for losses not covered by the other side up to the plan’s limits.  In addition to economic and non-economic damages, an individual injured in a drunk driving accident caused by another party may be able to seek punitive or exemplary damages. The purpose of punitive damages is to punish the individual who acted egregiously without consideration for the consequences of their actions. Exemplary damages serve to hold the other side accountable. It also deters them from similar conduct in the future. In the case of a DUI crash, it is intended to make an example out of the driver that their egregious behavior will not be tolerated.  How Much Time Do You Have to File an Injury Case?  A statute of limitations is the amount of time you have to file a lawsuit in court. Failure to do so may result in the loss of the right to take legal action. In most cases of personal injury, claimants generally have up to two years to file. This is by the California Code of Civil Procedure Section 335.1. Exceptions may apply under specific circumstances. For assistance with your case, it is recommended to retain legal counsel immediately.

Her fiance Jai Gandhi was driving the car at the time.  Ankit told ETimes that the news of his sister’s death has left him broken, and that informing their parents about it was the toughest things to do. Vaibhavi’s parents were in Australia at the time, and were not made aware of her death until they reached Mumbai. They were inconsolable at her funeral.

A Pender County mother of six, who goes above and beyond every day to raise her children with the love and care they need, is worth celebrating.  What You Need To Know Andrea Carr is a mother of six    Her son, Jones, was in a four-wheeler accident when he was 5, which resulted in a brain injury    Carr says Jones is a miracle and she's grateful for him and the lessons he teaches her every day    She says she attributes his success to the care she received at area hospitals like Novant Health  Andrea Carr has always felt a calling to motherhood.  “Oh, I always wanted to be a mom,” said Carr. “Forever and ever and ever.”  Carr has six children who she’s raised with lots of love, but motherhood isn’t always easy and can come with many unexpected challenges.  When her son Jones was 5 years old, he was in a four-wheeler accident that forever changed their lives.  “He was not wearing a helmet,” said Carr. “And it cut his head but it severed an artery in his neck, which caused a stroke and it caused a brain injury.”  At that point, Carr was expecting the worst, but now Jones is 18 and living a life filled with purpose.  “They really did not give him much of a chance at that point to live,” said Carr. “So he’s a miracle and I’m thankful every single day that I have with him. He’s just been such a blessing to me in my life.”  Jones has been receiving care at area hospitals like Duke and Novant Health.  Novant Health Pediatric Doctor Michael Stoiko says they’ve seen Jones pretty regularly since the accident in 2009.  “Jones has had a number of medical problems that have required him to be hospitalized on a pretty regular basis,” said Stoiko. “Some of them pretty serious, even life-threatening.”  Bringing a child into the hospital regularly and having the fear of it being the last time was hard on Carr, but she received excellent support from the doctors and nurses involved with Jones.  “We have a very personal relationship, and when he is here and does require additional care or he’s really really sick, everybody is involved and everybody is trying to be supportive of him and his mother,"" Stoiko said. “Everyone really loves him and everyone really loves his mom.”  That support means everything to Carr.  “I could not ask for better, total care, than they give for my son and for me. They’re just unbelievable there,"" Carr said. “There’s a difference of taking care of a patient and doing the normal daily routine and then really taking care of a patient with your heart, and they take care of Jones with their heart.”  When Jones isn’t at the hospital or adjusting to new medication, he is generally awake and able to react and show emotion.  “He, like I said, had an adjustment in the medication for his pump this week,"" Carr said. “But he laughs and smiles, and he loves to get in the pool, that’s his favorite pastime.”  Seeing Jones able to live a life that has meaning, after that life was so close to being lost, means everything. Carr says she learns something new from him every day and she hopes that others can too.  “When he looks at me and smiles it just melts my whole heart and he doesn’t expect anything in return. There’s no expectations, it’s just pure love,” said Carr. “So I think if everybody could be a lot more like Jones, the world would be so much better.”  Carr attributes much of her son’s success to the care they’ve receive at area hospitals. Novant Health was recently recognized for its exceptional pediatric care, something Jones and his family experienced firsthand.  The Carr family is hoping to make some adjustments to their pool so that Jones can enjoy it this summer.

Rogers has since been moved out of an ICU unit and is recovering, prompting the launch of a GoFundMe to help cover expenses.  Content warning: descriptions of the injuries Rogers sustained are graphic.  On Twitter, Cliffdiver shared a detailed recollection of the harrowing ""freak accident"" which left the band panicked that they were going to lose their bandmate and close friend.  Setting out to perform at a charity show associated with Punk Rock Bowling festival in Las Vegas on Friday (May 26), the group departed their home town of Tulsa, Oklahoma in their brand new tour van.  ""We were probably the most excited we've ever been to be spending the week together and getting back on the road,"" writes guitarist/vocalist Matt Ehler, ""We had made it almost an hour outside of Tulsa when everything changed in an instant. We were near Stroud, Oklahoma traveling westbound on Interstate 44 when at approximately 11:00 AM, there was an enormous BOOM sound that sounded like a cannon being fired as the entire front of the van filled with glass shards and dust.""  Ehler shares that the driver side window was shattered and that Rogers, who was driving the van at the time, was knocked unconscious while front seat passenger Eliot Cooper (drums) took hold of the wheel as Rogers' foot remained on the gas pedal. The guitarist notes he was seated behind Rogers and began to shake his bandmate's body as he yelled his name in hopes he would become conscious again.  ""At this point, we noticed that blood was spewing out of his neck/head region and drenching his body and the surrounding area,"" he continues, recalling that they were able to get his foot off the gas pedal and stop the vehicle to issue first aid, applying pressure to his neck and throat while trying to locate the direct location of where the blood was coming from.  Rogers regained ""the tiniest bit of consciousness"" as emergency personnel arrived on scene.  Once the bassist's condition was stabilized, the sheriff told the band that a ""large steel chain link"" was found lodged in Rogers' neck and that it was likely that ""a semi-truck was pulling a trailer that had a load-bearing chain strap that had snapped under pressure, launching the chain link across the interstate and through the van window and into Rogers' neck.  With the permission of Rogers and his family, Cliffdiver shared a photo of the bloodstained chain link which can be seen here (warning: graphic).  Regarding the extent of the injuries, Ehler notes, ""The emergency center determined that Tyler's carotid artery had been punctured, his jugular was lacerated, he had fractures in his neck, had lost approximately 2 liters of blood and needed emergency surgery."" Fortunately, it was determined that Rogers will not suffer from neurological/brain damage as a result of the incident.  Rogers has relocated from the ICU unit to a ""normal room"" within 24 hours and is currently recovering. The band is unsure how long his hospital stay and subsequent recovery will last and are thankful for the outpouring of support from the music community.  As a result, however, Cliffdiver's touring plans in support of last year's debut album Exercise Your Demons have been put on hold and are utilizing GoFundMe seeking to ""raise enough to cover all incurred medical expenses, lost income, rehabilitation, repairs and damages and whatever else it takes to ensure that Tyler, his family and the band can fully recover and recuperate.""

The sinking was the worst disaster on record involving migrants in the narrow seaway separating Britain from mainland Europe.

When Vishal Shukla was 23, he was in a bodysurfing accident in California, where a spinal cord injury paralyzed most of his body. After surgery, he got some devastating news: he was not expected to be able to walk again.  “It’s something that a 23-year-old kid never wants to hear. The exact words were ‘We do not think you’ll walk,’” he said.  But fast forward 14 months and Shukla, a student at Southern Utah University, is not just walking but climbing mountains. After rigorous training – physically and mentally – he says his recovery is nothing short of a miracle.  “I can use my hands. I can use my arms. I can move around, but my paralysis still affects me to a pretty considerable degree. For example, my triceps are still pretty paralyzed. I can’t do a push-up. My grip strength is only a third of what it used to be,” he said.  Still, Shukla summited Mount Hood, the tallest peak in Oregon, last Wednesday – something not many people can accomplish, let alone people once paralyzed in all four limbs.  “So, it was definitely a pretty strenuous climb. But I have absolutely nothing but sheer gratitude for my friends and the crew that we had up there. Honestly, if it wasn’t for them, there’s no way I would have made it up that mountain,” he said.  Shukla credits his progress to the teams at Intermountain Health in Murray, Utah, and physical therapists at Neuroworx in Sandy, Utah. He says he went from using a wheelchair to a walker to forearm crutches to a leg brace.  “Fortunately, just thanks to the entire team – the physiotherapists, the occupational therapists and doctors – everyone did such an amazing job,” he said. “Now, I’m at the point where my walking gait’s pretty normal.”  Shukla also turned his journey into a way to give back to one of the places that helped him recover. He decided to fundraise for families at Neuroworx who might not be able to afford the kind of care they need.  “One of the first thoughts I feel like most people have is that you just don’t want anyone else to go through such a similar experience,” he said. “That money will cover continued rehab sessions that other people’s insurance will unfortunately no longer cover.”  Donations to Shukla’s cause can be made on his GoFundMe page.

Two people were killed and two others injured in a collision with a locomotive Thursday afternoon in Clark County’s Richwoods community south of Gum Springs.  The railroad crossing where the accident occurred connects Richwoods Road and Fisher Loop. The Gum Springs and Arkadelphia fire departments were summoned to the scene at 1:48 p.m.  According to an Arkansas State Police fatal crash summary, Chad M. Fryar, 37, of Malvern, was driving the vehicle involved in the collision: a 2017 Chevrolet Silverado, described by local authorities as a one-ton flatbed pickup truck. Fryar was air-lifted to Baptist Health Medical Center in Little Rock.  Sheriff Jason Watson confirmed that two juveniles were deceased. A third juvenile was taken by a second helicopter to Arkansas Children’s Hospital. The bodies of the two deceased juveniles were transported to the Clark County Coroner’s Office.  According to investigating state Trooper Kendrick Davis, as Fryar traveled across the tracks a northbound Union Pacific locomotive struck the passenger side of the vehicle, lodging the truck to the front of the train. Following the collision the train continued on its northbound path before it was able to come to a halt near the Richwoods Cemetery, about 1/2 mile from the location of the crash.  There are crossbuck stop signs on both sides of the tracks at that crossing, but no flashing lights or crossing gate.

"accident","2015-04-20","Not Discerned","{""NewYork"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-24T16:28:06","A federal court in New York has reiterated that a time lag between the date a trip-and-fall accident occurred and when the conduct alleged to have caused it took place does not itself relieve an insurer of its duty to defend its insured in an injury suit related to the accident.  ACE American Insurance Co. has been ordered to defend Consolidated Edison (ConED) in an injury lawsuit that blames one of ConEd’s sidewalk contractors for work it did months before the injury happened.  After Altagracia Ramirez tripped and fell on a sidewalk in the Bronx on April 20, 2015, she sued the owner and manager of the adjacent property. They, in turn, sued ConEd, which they believed was responsible for work on the sidewalk.  ConEd claimed that one of its contractors, Petmar Builders, was responsible for the construction work, and since ConEd was covered as an additional insured on the ACE contractor’s policy, ConEd asked the ACE to defend it.  ACE declined to provide a defense, largely because its insured contractor’s work did not happen “on/about” the date of the accident. Because Petmar’s work at the site was completed 10 months before the accident “and the job was signed off,” in ACE’s view, there was no coverage.  ConEd countered that there was coverage for defense because even though the contractor insured by ACE completed its work prior to the date of the alleged incident, this did not eliminate the possibility that the insured caused or created the defective condition that in turn allegedly caused Ramirez to fall.  The federal court for the Southern District of New York sided with ConEd and ordered that ACE defend ConEd.  The court said ACE was wrong in arguing that Petmar must have done its work on or about the time of the accident to trigger defense coverage for two reasons: the facts presented to ACE suggested a reasonable possibility that its named insured, Petmar, was a proximate cause of the accident, and the 10-month lapse of time between the contractor’s work and the accident does not cut off the chain of proximate cause as a matter of law.  There were indications in documents that ConEd was supposed to complete a permanent repair of the construction site after Petmar did a temporary repair. But the court said that was not at issue at this stage.  ACE had actual knowledge of facts indicating that Petmar had worked at the site of the accident, that Petmar had prepared a temporary patch, and that ConEd had not completed a permanent patch before the date of Ramirez’s accident.  “These facts were sufficient to indicate that Petmar had engaged in conduct—opening and temporarily patching the sidewalk—that gives rise to a risk that corresponds to the harm that ultimately took place—Ramirez tripping and falling on the sidewalk where the work was done,” the court said.  The information known to ACE at the time of its decision to decline coverage indicated a “reasonable possibility” that Petmar’s conduct proximately caused Ramirez’s injuries. As a result, ACE had a duty to defend ConEd in the underlying action, the court concluded.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNsYWltc2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL25ld3MvZWFzdC8yMDIzLzA1LzI0LzMxNzE1My5odG3SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

A CCTV footage which is being widely circulated on the internet shows the biker losing control of this bike and ramming straight into the concrete pillar. Reports suggest that there was a 15-minutes delay in making a SOS call due to connectivity issues inside the tunnel even though it was allegedly equipped with a emergency telephone SOS systems.  The biker reportedly succumbed to the injuries he sustained on this head. As per the police, the major cause of his death was 'brain injuries as his helmet was completely damaged'.  Also, looking closely at the CCTV footage suggest that the biker has hit his head on the concrete pillar that resulted in the fatal injuries.  While Times Drive has no update on the quality/make of the helmet the victim was using at the time of accident, as reports suggest, the rider's helmet was completely shattered from the impact. However, helmets from reputed brands generally do not shatter easily and are designed to absorb just high intensity impacts.  Why good quality helmets matter?  Helmets play a crucial role in protecting the lives. As a primary safety measure, they significantly reduce the risk of head injuries and fatalities in the event of accidents. The importance of wearing a helmet cannot be overstated, as it acts as a reliable shield against potential head trauma, safeguarding the most vulnerable part of the human body.  Helmets are designed to absorb the impact of a collision and distribute the force across a larger surface area, thus reducing the chances of severe head injuries. They provide a protective barrier against head trauma, skull fractures, brain damage, and other life-threatening injuries. By preventing or minimizing the extent of head injuries, helmets not only save lives but also contribute to the overall well-being and quality of life of riders.  Why India needs to promote safer helmets? A majority of the helmets that sell in the Indian market lack safety and miss the international safety standards by miles.  Thus it is essential to recognize that helmets must meet proper safety standards and be appropriately fitted to provide optimal protection.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aW1lc25vd25ld3MuY29tL2F1dG8vcHJhZ2F0aS1tYWlkYW4tdHVubmVsLWFjY2lkZW50LWlzLWEtZ3JpbS1yZW1pbmRlci13aHkteW91LW5lZWQtdG8tdXNlLXNhZmVyLWhlbG1ldHMtYXJ0aWNsZS0xMDA0OTMyNzDSAYsBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGltZXNub3duZXdzLmNvbS9hdXRvL3ByYWdhdGktbWFpZGFuLXR1bm5lbC1hY2NpZGVudC1pcy1hLWdyaW0tcmVtaW5kZXItd2h5LXlvdS1uZWVkLXRvLXVzZS1zYWZlci1oZWxtZXRzLWFydGljbGUtMTAwNDkzMjcwL2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"accident","2023-05-22","Not Discerned","{""Brandon"", ""Mississippi"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-25T05:04:31","New You can now listen to Insurance Journal articles!  Greasy, toxin-laden wastewater discharges by a Mississippi animal feed maker were not accidents and thus are not covered by a Crum & Foster pollution policy, a federal appeals court decided this week in a case that stemmed from an investigation that led to guilty pleas by two company officials.  The U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals on May 22 upheld a lower court’s 2022 ruling in Gold Coast Commodities Inc. vs. Crum & Forster Specialty Insurance Co. Gold Coast, which made feed and fertilizer from recovered restaurant cooking oil and animal fat, asked the federal district court to declare that Crum & Forster had a duty to defend the firm in a lawsuit brought by the city of Brandon.  The district court and the appeals court declined, noting emphatically that Mississippi law, like statutes in most states, requires defense of a third-party complaint only when the complaint “contains allegations covered by the language of the policy.” The pollution liability policy covered only accidents, not the intentional, surreptitious, and repeated dumping of the oily mess alleged by the state and local authorities.  “Facially-speaking, Gold Coast’s alleged wrongdoings clearly sound intentional, not accidental,” the 5th Circuit panel wrote in the opinion.  Gold Coast’s attorneys had tried to argue that the key word in the city’s complaint was “negligence,” which arguably means the discharges were accidental in nature.  “We aren’t convinced,” the judges wrote. “Drive-by or ‘conclusory’ uses of the word ‘negligence’ don’t transform the character of the factual allegations of intentional misconduct.”  The highly publicized dumping case began in 2017, and reads a little like a crime novel. The city of Brandon, an affluent suburb of Jackson, told the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality that it suspected that Gold Coast was secretly discharging the oily, low-pH, untreated wastewater into public sewers. The DEQ and the city began investigating. Brandon crews collected samples of sewage downstream from the feed plant and found that the water was much hotter and more acidic – with high levels of arsenic, lead, cadmium, chromium and mercury, the court opinion explained.  The city filed suit, charging that the discharge from Gold Coast was so corrosive that the city had to spend significant funds repairing its sewer system.  In August 2022, the owner of Gold Coast pleaded guilty to illegally dumping industrial waste into the Jackson sewer system. A month later, the president and the plant manager were indicted on the same charges, according to news reports and the U.S. attorney’s office. An employee at an industrial services firm also pleaded guilty to assisting Gold Coast in disposing of the toxic waste.  Circuit Judged Andrew Oldham dissented from the majority in the Crum & Forster opinion. He argued that the city of Brandon’s complaint was ambiguous and did not allege an intentional act. But, he said, Crum does not have duty to defend because the tortious conduct began before the insurance policy’s effective date.  The coverage dispute was not the first for Crum & Forster over oil products in recent months. In April of this year, two Crum subsidiaries asked a federal court in Massachusetts to declare that they have no duty to defend or cover a heating oil company over its delivery of oil that contained biodiesel. The incompatible oil allegedly damaged customers’ heating systems and set off class-action lawsuits.  The Crum companies argued that class actions fall outside the primary and umbrella policies and that the oil company knew the risks of mixing the fuels. The insurers said the policies excluded expected or intentional actions that caused damage and excluded damage from erroneous delivery of liquids.

In separate flights over the weekend, Jeffrey and cancer patient Deborah Carr’s paths almost crossed. While Carr was returning home to her family after receiving treatment in Suriname, T’rique was being hurried off to a specialised burn care centre in the Dominican Republic.  Media Relations Specialist for CAF, Jamilla Kirwan, said she received a call from T’rique’s tearful mother and father late last week, requesting assistance for the US$20,200 air ambulance flight.  At the time, T’rique was in a medically induced coma in the ICU at the Sir Lester Bird Medical Center, after sustaining burns to 52 percent of his body. A medical report provided by the family indicated that T’rique had extensive burns to his left arm, chest, abdomen, back, both limbs, and face.  T’rique Jeffrey Royston Jeffrey (right) accompanied his son overseas along with the boy’s mother Latoya Jarvis (right) with Reva Air Ambulance staff  He was injured after apparently putting rubbing alcohol on his skin, before playing with a lighter and accidentally setting himself on fire.  Given the extent of his burns, the decision was made by local hospital doctors to seek transfer to an overseas centre better equipped to adequately manage his case. T’rique’s parents Royston Jeffrey and Latoya Jarvis accompanied their son to the Dominican Republic.  Royston has kept Kirwan updated on his progress via WhatsApp.  “I will always be thankful and grateful to you guys,” Kirwan said the emotional father responded in a voice note.

In the request letter to the Foundation, the spokesperson indicated that Carr had initially travelled to Suriname for treatment but, due to her extremely weakened state, would have needed to return home via air ambulance, accompanied by medical support.  The air ambulance cost the Foundation US$62,000, a figure the family spokesperson said they would never have been able to afford.  Kirwan added that she sends her best wishes to both families on behalf of CAF and Ambassador Calvin Ayre, and pledged CAF’s continued support to the people of Antigua and Barbuda.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vYW50aWd1YW9ic2VydmVyLmNvbS9jaGlsZC03LWJhZGx5LWJ1cm50LWluLWFjY2lkZW50LXVuZGVyZ29lcy10d28tc3VjY2Vzc2Z1bC1vcHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Attorneys Patrick S. Montoya and Markus M. Kamberger represented Jose Cruz and his family in the case. Cruz, the victim of two hit-and-runs that occurred within seconds of each other, spent two months in a coma and over 100 days in the hospital. He suffered a brain injury, a lumbar fracture, pelvic fractures, and lost his right leg in the accident.

""We asked the jury to award the price of normalcy for Mr. Cruz and his three minor daughters. We are proud to serve the Cruz family a piece of justice from a jury of their peers.""  Mr. Cruz was stopped at a red light near the Florida Turnpike when his vehicle was struck from behind. He then exited the vehicle to assess the damage and speak with the other driver, who fled. Moments later, a second driver failed to stop and struck Mr. Cruz at 40 – 50 mph while he was standing next to his disabled vehicle. That driver fled the scene as well.  Whitfield Coleman Montoya filed a lawsuit against the two drivers on behalf of the Cruz family. On May 22, a Broward County jury awarded compensatory damages for Mr. Cruz's past and future medical care and nursing expenses, loss of earnings and ability to earn a living, loss of capacity for the enjoyment of life, disability, disfigurement, and pain and suffering, in addition to his daughters' loss of consortium resulting from Mr. Cruz's permanent injuries.

Details are here!  The problems with Tesla’s autonomous driving system (FSD) are endless. This time, a vehicle driver filed a lawsuit against the company, which was previously tried for some fatal accidents. According to the driver’s claim, the vehicle forced him into an accident.  Using the electric car sharing system Revel, Akm Şemsuzzaman claimed that Tesla, which he used for work, drove himself on pedestrians and had an accident as a result.  Tesla Returns to Court  Compared to other electric vehicle manufacturers, Tesla’s introduction of autopilot support much earlier and capturing a large user base across the USA is seen as one of the company’s greatest achievements in recent years. However, in the past months, the name of the Tesla autopilot has been involved in many accidents.  It is stated that Tesla autopilot is in control in some fatal accidents. However, it is claimed that Akm Şemsuzzaman was almost never guilty in the accident. Shamsuzamman claims that the vehicle took off without warning in a parking garage and drove into pedestrians.  The driver, who pressed the brakes to stop, states that when he realized that the brakes were not working, he drove the vehicle into an empty parking lot to avoid hitting people and forced the vehicle to crash. Shamsuzamman, who was seriously and permanently injured after the accident, sued Tesla in the New York State Supreme Court.  While the model of the defective Tesla vehicle is not specified, the case is thought to take several years. On the other hand, accidents involving Tesla autopilot in the USA continue to increase day by day. If accidents continue, Tesla could lose their autopilot licenses.

The remaining hurdles to enacting the law are the full meeting of the committee and the Assembly plenary session.  An amendment bill that calls for the government to compensate for unavoidable childbirth accidents fully has passed a subcommittee of the National Assembly's Legal Affairs and Judiciary Committee on Wednesday. (Credit: Getty Images)  The Legal Affairs-Judiciary Committee held a subcommittee meeting on bills and deliberated and passed 33 bills, including an amendment to the Act on Medical Accident Damage Relief and Mediation of Medical Disputes on Wednesday.  The amendment to the Medical Accident Damage Relief and Mediation of Medical Dispute passed the subcommittee as the Ministry of Economy and Finance, which had been negative about the national compensation system for unavoidable medical accidents, changed its stance, according to parliamentary sources.  “The low birthrate is the most important national issue, and in this context, we agree with the Ministry of Health and Welfare that the government's role should be strengthened in the obstetrics and gynecology field, which is an essential medical area but placed under poor medical environment,"" said Kim Wan-soo, director of the economy and finance ministry’s Pension and Health and Budget Division.  However, the subcommittee failed to act on the amendment due to a lack of quorum.  The amendment bill, which passed the subcommittee, provides that the state will bear the full cost of compensation for unavoidable medical accidents during the delivery process despite the healthcare provider's duty of care. Currently, the compensation is financed 70 percent by the government and 30 percent by childbirth institutions.  Obstetricians welcome the bill’s passage at the subcommittee.  “It has the important implication of making the state fully liable for no-fault delivery accidents,"" said Kim Jae-yeon, chair of the Korean Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. “We appreciate the efforts of the Legal Affairs and Judiciary Committee and the Ministry of Health and Welfare to correct a law that violated the civil law doctrine of contributory negligence by requiring physicians to share in costs when they are not responsible.”  Kim noted that some obstetricians, even after paying large settlement money, cannot leave the delivery room to raise more funds for compensative maternal or neonatal deaths that have occurred despite their best efforts, adding that the amendment gives them hope after despairing over events that happened despite their best efforts.  “We hope that the amount of compensation for unavoidable medical accidents will be adjusted to a level that reflects the medical reality, the number of delivery-related medical cases will decrease, and the reimbursement for deliveries will be raised to a realistic level, creating a more stable childbirth environment,"" Kim said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvcmVhYmlvbWVkLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVWaWV3Lmh0bWw_aWR4bm89MjExODjSAUBodHRwczovL3d3dy5rb3JlYWJpb21lZC5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlVmlld0FtcC5odG1sP2lkeG5vPTIxMTg4?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The organisations, while expressing concern over number of deaths caused by road crashes, said they would work towards meeting United Nations (UN) Decade of Action for Road Safety 2021-2030 resolution target.  The UN plan has ambitious target of preventing at least 50 per cent of road traffic deaths and injuries by 2030.  They made the pledge at the launch, induction and training programme for pre and pro-crash initiative for the road transport sector organised by RTEAN for its members in Abuja, yesterday.  According to data released by FRSC this month (May), over 40,000 people die yearly as a result of road crashes in the country.  Also, about 1.3 million people were killed, and as many as 50 million people get injured each year globally.  Speaking at the event, President of RTEAN, Musa Maitakobi, stressed the need to enhance and improve on response time at any emergency situation on the road.  Maitakobi, who was represented by his deputy, Muhammad Bushara, said members of RTEAN would be massively trained in collaboration with the Nigerian Red Cross officials to efficiently handle emergency situations at the point of accident before moving to the hospital to save lives.  Noting that Mobile Emergency First Aid Clinics will be provided on roads, the RTEAN’s boss explained that road accidents victims would also be assisted to receive first aid treatment from the point of accidents by RTEAN trained members.  He stated: “For success of this programme, we intend to embark on public enlightenment, as this is the first time any association or union in the transport sector is initiating a programme that involves lives in collaboration with other professionals and experts in the field.  “It is also our belief that, with time, more persons will be trained (as we embark on training the trainers), and the issue of travellers dying before they could get to the hospital will be minimized. And with the support from relevant government agencies and organisations, we shall succeed and the roads will be made death free for Nigerians.”  ","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vZ3VhcmRpYW4ubmcvbmV3cy9ydGVhbi1mcnNjLXJlZC1jcm9zcy1tb3ZlLXRvLXJlZHVjZS1yb2FkLWFjY2lkZW50LWRlYXRocy1ieS01MC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

A public celebration of life has been scheduled for 12 p.m. Friday at the gardens.  Courtesy photo  A public celebration of life has been scheduled for Eagle County local Nick Courtens on Friday from noon to 2 p.m. at the Betty Ford Alpine Gardens in Vail.  Courtens, 34, the garden’s curator of plant collections, died in a paddling accident in Glenwood Canyon on Sunday.  Garfield County Coroner Robert Glassmire confirmed Tuesday morning to the Glenwood Springs Post Independent that Courtens was pronounced dead at the scene between Shoshone and Grizzly Creek in Glenwood Canyon after he fell from a raft and drowned.  Courtens was born on March 14, 1989, in New York, the oldest in a family of three children. He was connected to horticulture from a young age through his family’s farm, Roxbury Farm, in the Hudson Valley of New York.  Courtens studied horticulture at the Longwood Gardens professional gardener program and came to Colorado for a summer internship at Betty Ford Alpine Gardens in May of 2010. He remained on staff following the internship, ultimately becoming the curator. He also joined Ski and Snowboard Club Vail in 2012 as a coach.  The Betty Ford Alpine Gardens described Courtens as a rising star in North American horticulture, and Ski and Snowboard Club Vail said he was a significant contributor to the freeski and snowboard community in Vail.  Those closest to Courtens knew him as a dependable friend who took the lead in helping to plan the celebrations of life for Bindu Pomery and Lily Connelly , who were both killed in backcountry snowboard and ski accidents in Vail. He was also deeply affected by the death of his friend Spencer Cooke, a Vail local who died in 2015.  Courtens was himself a talented backcountry skier and also enjoyed mountain biking, fly-fishing and whitewater rafting. He was a world traveler who ventured to Alaska for heli-skiing, Central America for sightseeing, and Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan for mountain trekking in an effort to learn more about high-altitude horticulture.  In recent years, Courtens had branched out into public speaking and had been featured at several presentations for plant societies and botanic gardens. In April he visited Vancouver, Canada, where he studied plants and gardens and participated in speaking engagements.  Courtens is survived by his parents, Kelly Testa and Jean-Paul Courtens, brother Johannes Courtens, sister Annie Courtens, stepmother Jody Bolluyt, grandmothers Meg Cashen and Corrie Courtens-Soonius, as well as many aunts, uncles and cousins.  Friday’s celebration of life will take place on the lawn at the lower bench of the Betty Ford Alpine Gardens location, adjacent to the gardens.  Members of the public are welcome to attend and are encouraged to park in the Vail Village parking structure and bring blankets or lawn chairs.  Pictures of Courtens will be shared at the event, and those who have pictures they wish to share can upload them to dedicated folders which have been set up on Dropbox and Google Drive .  There will also be a visitation from 5-7 p.m. on Thursday at the Vail Interfaith Chapel.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb3N0aW5kZXBlbmRlbnQuY29tL25ld3MvY2VsZWJyYXRpb24tb2YtbGlmZS1mb3Itbmljay1jb3VydGVucy13aG8tZGllZC1pbi1nbGVud29vZC1jYW55b24tcGFkZGxpbmctYWNjaWRlbnQtc2V0LWZvci1mcmlkYXktaW4tdmFpbC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The hospital said on Wednesday the team conducted the rare redo surgery of the ureter via Da Vinci robotic-assisted technology to treat the damaged urethra of the patient who had suffered a major pelvic fracture and serious damage to his vital organs in a road accident.  The surgery lasted for three hours and within 4 days the patient was discharged, the hospital added.  When the man, 37, was admitted admission at Fortis Gurgaon, he was on a catheter, which was inserted into the bladder through the abdomen, and was unable to pass urine on his own. He had severe disabling complications such as recurrent stricture (narrowing of the urethra), urinary incontinence (leaking urine by accident) and erectile dysfunction. He had undergone a procedure to reconstruct the urethra twice at Zambian-based hospitals, but both times, the procedure did not yield any results. He was advised to be on a suprapubic catheter—a device that’s inserted into the bladder to drain urine—for his entire life.  Also read | AIIMS to launch surgical robotics training facility for resident doctors, faculty today  Giving details of the case, Dr (Prof.) Anil Mandhani, Executive Director, Urology and Kidney Transplant, Fortis Memorial Research Institute, Gurgaon, said, “During the road accident, the patient’s pelvis to which the prostate is firmly attached got fractured and he was diagnosed with Pelvic fracture urethral distraction defect. When there is a disruption near the prostate in the male urethra, the two ends of the urethral tube move away from each other.”  “During open surgery, it is often necessary to remove a portion of the bone to access the proximal end of the urethral tube. However, joining the disrupted ends can be challenging as suturing may not be perfect. Hence, we decided to do a cystoscopy, a procedure to look inside the bladder using a thin camera called a cystoscope, along with robot-assisted redo (end to end) anastomotic urethroplasty under general anaesthesia,” added Mandhani.  “The robotic-assisted technology made the surgery easier as the doctors could reach the areas where it was very difficult to reach with bare hands. Also, robot-aided surgeries provide ten times magnification of the surgery site. In India, this is the first time a robot-aided surgery is being done in such a case,” he added.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9jaXRpZXMvZGVsaGkvZ3VyZ2Fvbi1wcml2YXRlLWhvc3BpdGFsLXJvYm90aWMtYWlkZWQtc3VyZ2VyeS16YW1iaWFuLWFjY2lkZW50LXZpY3RpbS04NjI3OTE1L9IBgwFodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvY2l0aWVzL2RlbGhpL2d1cmdhb24tcHJpdmF0ZS1ob3NwaXRhbC1yb2JvdGljLWFpZGVkLXN1cmdlcnktemFtYmlhbi1hY2NpZGVudC12aWN0aW0tODYyNzkxNS9saXRlLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"accident","2019-08-14","14:00:00","{""Philadelphia"", ""Pennsylvania"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-24T09:23:35","Data: The League of American Bicyclists via NHTSA; Chart: Kavya Beheraj/Axios  Philadelphia bicyclists face danger every time they're on the roadways, and now there's a troubling increase in hit-and-runs that advocates say they must worry about, too.  Driving the news: There were 2.5 fatal bicycle crashes on average for every million Philadelphia residents between 2017-2021, per data from the League of American Bicyclists via National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. That's up 9% from 2012-2016, Axios' Alex Fitzpatrick and Kavya Beheraj report.  Why it matters: Bicycle use surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving many cities scrambling to install new bike lanes and adopt other measures to keep riders safe and encourage cycling.  Zoom in: Last year, 35 Philadelphians were killed in hit-and-runs, more than double the fatalities of 2019, per the Bicycle Coalition of Greater Philadelphia, citing police data.  The deaths included bicyclists, pedestrians, motorcyclists, skateboarders and at least two people struck while riding electric scooters.  The city has tried addressing the problem by installing protected bike lanes on more than 24 miles of streets. Officials pledged to increase that to 40 miles by 2025.  What they're saying: The ""trend line is going in the wrong direction,"" Sarah Clark Stuart, executive director of the Bicycle Coalition of Greater Philadelphia, tells Axios.  Zoom out: Philly cyclists have fared slightly better compared to the national average. There were 2.7 fatal bicycle crashes for every million U.S. residents between 2017-2021.  New Orleans (9.9), Tucson (8.9) and Jacksonville (7.9) had the highest rates of fatal accidents per million residents.  The latest: Some of the country's best new bike lane projects are in Seattle, Portland and Bethesda, Maryland, per advocacy group PeopleForBikes.  Jersey City and Hoboken, meanwhile, got a shoutout for an innovative project meant to better connect the neighboring cities, which have historically been frustratingly disconnected despite their proximity and well-developed internal bike lane networks.  The intrigue: Cities are grappling not just with an upswing in traditional bicycle use, but also a boom in e-bikes used by residents, tourists and delivery workers.  The challenge is figuring out how to best integrate the zippier, pedal-assist bikes — do they belong in bike lanes with slower, traditional two-wheelers, or should they be among the cars and trucks, where Vespa-style scooters travel?  Reality check: Protected bike lanes and other measures designed to keep cyclists safe are often met with fierce pushback from urban drivers who lament the loss of any lanes or parking spots.  What's next: Cities nationwide are applying for state and federal money — including some set aside as part of the 2021 infrastructure law — to further develop their bike trail networks and other cycling infrastructure.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS9sb2NhbC9waGlsYWRlbHBoaWEvMjAyMy8wNS8yNC9iaWN5Y2xlLWZhdGFsaXRpZXMtaGl0LWFuZC1ydW4tZGVhdGhz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Soward reported that Abel Calvillo Sr., 64, was found buried under mud after the walls of a 100-foot dug out mining road collapsed on a bulldozer he was operating at the mine operated by North American Construction Group.  According to reports, Calvillo was reported missing on the evening of Tuesday, May 16 as mine crews were unable to locate him. Atascosa Sheriff’s deputies and emergency services from Jourdanton Volunteer Fire Department were dispatched to the scene shortly after 4 a.m. on Wednesday.  “We were all just together for Mother’s Day and three days later, he was just gone,” said Rebecca Pesqueda, Calvillo’s niece. “It’s hard to put into words how our family is feeling right now, especially knowing he was alone when it happened. Abel filled our lives with so much laughter and love. He especially loved the children in our family, always joking and playing with them. He loved all of us like we were his own. We miss him so much.”  According to reports, a sheriff’s office drone was used and detected a hot spot under a mass of dirt, mud and water using thermal imaging equipment on the drone. That is when first responders and mine employees discovered a small portion of the dozer blade emerged from the mud and water.  “The area was difficult to navigate and personnel searching were sinking to their waist in the mud,” Soward said.  Search efforts were able to reach the cab of the dozer and pull the victim from the heavy machinery.  The victim was pronounced deceased at the scene by Justice of the Peace Rusty Prasifka who ordered an autopsy.  The exact cause of the fatal accident is under investigation by the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration. San Miguel referred the Pleasanton Express to North American Construction Group for comment. North American Construction Group declined to comment amid the investigation.  “We are grateful to all of the family, friends and members of our community who have reached out to us, stopped by or brought us food,” Pesqueda added. “I personally want to thank Constable Cregg Thompson, Pct. 3, who stopped by that morning and offered his condolences. It meant more to our family than he will ever know. Also Justice of the Peace Judge Rusty Prasifka, Precinct 4, and Commissioner Eliseo Perez of Precinct 3 for their help that day.”  “My dad was such a wonderful and hardworking man,” said Abel Jr. Calvillo. “I’m truly heartbroken and devastated by his tragic passing. I am thankful for all the great memories we shared together. Rest In Paradise dad, I love you,”  Calvillo’s obituary states that Abel was a very hardworking man who always lightened people’s day by making jokes and making everyone laugh. It stated he was respected by many, not only for his work ethic but his character, he always made time to be around his family and friends.  Visitation for Calvillo will be held on Mon., May 29 from 2-7 p.m. at Hurley Funeral Home. A funeral Mass will be held 11:30 a.m. on Tues., May 30 at St. Rose of Lima Catholic Church in Charlotte with interment in Charlotte Community Cemetery.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBsZWFzYW50b25leHByZXNzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9mYXRhbC1taW5pbmctYWNjaWRlbnQtY2xhaW1zLW9uZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Dhola was produced before the magistrate, who remanded him in judicial custody after the police did not seek his further remand.  Meanwhile, the suspect has withdrawn an application filed for permission to appear in a BA first year examination. In the application, filed through advocates Terminder Singh and Sunil Singh Gill, Dhola had stated his police custody since May 20 had caused him mental stress and left him with little time to prepare for the examination. Under the circumstances, he did not wish to take the exam slated for May 26 and sought court’s permission to withdraw the application.  In another application, Dhola sought court directions to the Superintendent, Burail Jail, to provide him medical facilities, including proper bedding due to a disc problem he had suffered in 2018. He further urged the court to put him in a barrack away from hardened criminals, considering his young age. The court ordered provision of medical facilities as per the jail manual.  The court also directed the investigating officer to submit “zimni” report (daily report) in such a way that there was very little space between the lines.

Christopher Shields, who worked for the department from August 2013 to November 2022, did not dispute any of the facts laid out in the Kansas Commission on Peace Officers’ Standards and Training order revoking his license. He signed the document dated on Monday.  KCPOST oversees officer certifications within the state.  Scroll to continue with content Ad ADVERTISEMENT  Shields cannot apply to be a Kansas officer again for five years.  Shields was a sergeant when he left less than two weeks after the Oct. 27 fatal accident. A call to a number associated with Shields was not answered and a message was not returned.  No one at the police department could be reached as well despite multiple calls.  The accident, based on details from the KCPOST and media reports, involved two vehicles. KSN reported that 70-year-old Paula McKinney died after she was headed west on 53rd Street South, tried to turn into a convenience store and was hit by a 26-year-old Wichita man driving eastbound. He was injured in the accident, which happened just before 6 a.m.  The police department’s procedure requires officers to take measurements involving the accident if someone is triaged code red, which means critical. Shields was “acting in a supervisory capacity” at the time of the wreck, the KCPOST document says.  McKinney was originally triaged yellow, or serious, but it was changed seven minutes later to red. Shields was not “specifically made aware” of the change but it was updated in the call’s log that he had access to.  A rookie officer asked if measurements needed to be taken, but Shields said no because he didn’t know, or check, whether the triage had been changed, the document says.  Shields called for two tow trucks.  At 7:11 a.m., as one of the vehicles was being towed, another officer told Shields that the woman had been transported to a hospital in critical condition.  “EMS told me yellow,” the document says Shields replied. “I’m going with what EMS told me.”  An autopsy says “EMS records indicated that she was alert and oriented, before suddenly decompensating.”  The second tow truck arrived and removed the second vehicle. Shields cleared the scene at 7:41 a.m. and went back to the police station.  At 7:44 a.m., Shields, now knowing the woman had been triaged in critical condition, called a captain and told him he was “unaware of the triage change until after he cleared the scene,” the document says.  He asked the captain for advice on what to do. Roughly 30 minutes later, Shields learned the woman died.  In his report Shields wrote: “Once back at the station I pulled the call on my MCT and noticed that (McKinney’s) triage had been downgraded to code red with a GCS of 3.”  GCS appears to stand for Glasgow Coma Scale, which is a measurement of how responsive someone is.  Shields also told multiple officers that he didn’t know of the change from yellow to red until he was back at the station, the document says.  “Despite his assertions in writing and to other PCPD officers that he did not know of the triage change until he returned to the station, body cam footage clearly shows (Shields) being notified of the change by another officer,” the document says. “He responded in a flippant manner and took no steps to verify the information, alter his response to the collision scene, or preserve the scene.”  Additionally, the document says, Shields later admitted to a KCPOST investigator that he learned about the triage change at the “collision scene when told by other officers.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vY2Euc3BvcnRzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL3BhcmstY2l0eS1vZmZpY2VyLWxvc2VzLWxpY2Vuc2UtMTkyNzA2MzI5Lmh0bWzSAVdodHRwczovL2NhLnNwb3J0cy55YWhvby5jb20vYW1waHRtbC9uZXdzL3BhcmstY2l0eS1vZmZpY2VyLWxvc2VzLWxpY2Vuc2UtMTkyNzA2MzI5Lmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Late Wednesday afternoon, the Sacramento County Coroner's Office identified the deceased as Christopher Edward Jarosz, 55, of Courtland.  Jarosz was the owner of multiple Sacramento restaurants including Anonimo Pizza and Broderick Roadhouse.  ""We are sadden (sic) to say that our leader Chris Jarosz had a terrible accident this morning and passed away. Our condolences to his family and closed (sic) friends. God bless Chris, rest in peace.

He was also a former president of the California Restaurant Association's Sacramento chapter. Jot Condie, the current president and CEO of the CRA said in a statement posted to Facebook:  ""We were deeply saddened today to learn of Chris' passing. Chris was an exceptionally warm and friendly person, it was truly in his nature to be an easygoing, approachable, and likable guy. He was also deeply dedicated to the Sacramento restaurant community and its workforce. He will be missed, and our thoughts are with his family and friends.""  We heard the tragic news today that our past Sacramento Chapter President, Chris Jarosz, passed away early this morning... Posted by CRA Sacramento Chapter on Wednesday, May 24, 2023  California Highway Patrol says, just after 2 a.m., officers responded to the westbound side of the freeway near 51st Street to investigate a crash. At the scene, officers found that an SUV had crashed into a one-ton flatbed truck.  The truck was hitched to an arrow board trailer that was activated, pointing drivers to the right. Two employees were inside the truck, CHP says.  Officers found that the SUV crashed into the arrow board trailer, then into the truck. Jarosz wasn't wearing a seatbelt, CHP says, and was pronounced dead at the scene.  Both people who were in the construction truck weren't hurt, officers say.  ""In the restaurant business, you face challenges every day, but he had that ability to make that challenge an opportunity,"" said Patrick Mulvaney, owner of Mulvaney's B&L in midtown.  It wasn't until Wednesday afternoon that Mulvaney heard the news of Jarosz's death.  ""A, it's such a shock, and B, it's so fresh that we don't even know,"" he told CBS13.  Mulvaney said his friendship with Jarosz spanned more than 15 years. Since then, he said Jarosz played a key role in elevating Sacramento's restaurant industry to what it is now.  ""We as a community, the hospitality community, have changed that, and Chris was a big part of that and we will miss him,"" Mulvaney said.  For Mulvaney, he hopes Sacramento remembers Jarosz by his entrepreneurial spirit.  ""He saw opportunities and took the bold step to make them happen, and in doing that, I would argue he made Sacramento a better place,"" he said.  The Highway 50 incident was one of three deadly crashes around the greater Sacramento area Wednesday morning.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL3NhY3JhbWVudG8vbmV3cy9mYXRhbC1hY2NpZGVudC1oaWdod2F5LTUwLTEtcGVyc29uLWRlYWQv0gFcaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL3NhY3JhbWVudG8vbmV3cy9zYWNyYW1lbnRvLWhpZ2h3YXktNTAtZGVhZGx5LWNyYXNoLWNocmlzLWphcm9zei8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"accident","2022-05-24","Not Discerned","{""Rome"", ""Lazio"", ""Italy""}","2023-05-25T01:57:00","A journey of recovery and gratitude: For the first time, star singer Yoni Z tells COLlive.com about the motorbike accident in Rome, the devastating aftermath, the ""mistaken"" request at the Rebbe's Ohel and what he learned from the year-long experience for his new single. Full Story  By Sruly Meyer – COLlive  When Jewish music star Yoni Z is asked what was the date of the accident in Italy? He answers, without missing a beat, May 24th, 2022. Clearly, this date is forever etched in his mind.  With his second album just released on Lag BaOmer last year, Yoni was set to visit Israel to promote the new album. Interviews were lined up, concerts scheduled and flights booked. After years of non-stop work, Yoni wanted to take a one-day break, a day that would later turn into a year.  Yoni made a planned pitstop in Rome on his way to Israel. While riding a motorbike, something he had done many times before in other countries, there was a pothole at the bottom of a hill he could not see. Just yards away from the famed Roman coliseum, Yoni hit the sinkhole and the force sent him forward 15 feet in the air. When he landed, Yoni could feel the bones break, in specific, 7 different areas of bone broke.  Yoni couldn’t walk. The only thing unaffected was his left arm. He spent the next 10 days in the hospital until he was medically allowed to be transported.  Speaking to COLlive.com this week, Yoni says: “I want to say thank you to Rabbi Menachem Lazar of the Chabad Piazza Bologna in Rome.” The original public hospital where Yoni was taken, was not equipped or at the level needed. Yoni credits Rabbi Lazar for saving his life after he helped him be transferred to a private clinic.  After arriving at the clinic, scans were taken and sent to 3 specialists in Israel to determine what could be done. Yoni says the doctors all asked the same question, how old was the patient? Hearing that he was only 30, the doctors agreed that Yoni could avoid surgery if he put in an intense year of therapy.  Yoni told COLlive.com that the night before he left for Israel via Rome, he wrote a letter to the Rebbe‘s Ohel in New York. In the letter, he mistakingly asked for “success in Rome” instead of writing in Israel. “After seeing what I wrote, I thought maybe I should change it, but decided to leave it,” he reveals.  Little did he know that this request for blessing would actually come to fruition, as Yoni did in fact, need a bracha for success in Rome.  Yoni arrived back in Suffern, New York right before Shavuos last year. He shoulder was shattered and he was wheelchair-bound. With his arm broken, he could not even put on Tefilin. He laid flat for another 7 weeks until taking his first step.  During this time, Yoni had to cancel his appearances at concerts, interviews, weddings, focusing only on his recovery. After working on this new album for 2 years, and 3 years since his debut album, Yoni had to stop. The energetic singer was forced to take a break.  He says that not being able to promote a new album was very hard. When people asked him if he would write any music about this accident, “all I could think about was getting my body to move naturally and be healthy.”  At some point, after starting physical therapy, which lasted this entire past year, Yoni started to see the recovery actually happen. “I told myself that I would only write and sing about the accident if I can share a lesson from it.”  To be able to see the good in anything, and to see a silver lining, Yoni could track a path from the point of his accident, a low point, to now, a high point, knowing he was able to recover, and come through something hard and come out stronger on the other side.  “The most valuable lesson I took from this was, when the accident happened, it was almost 14 years since I had started singing,” he says. “I was always running, always chasing, always trying to reach a certain point of success, but I never stopped for a moment and appreciated the journey.”  Yoni continues, “It’s like riding a train through the Swiss Alps just to get to your destination without actually enjoying what you are seeing along the way.”  When asked what this taught him, Yoni answers: “It’s not about the destination. In fact, I don’t even know if there is a destination. It’s about the journey, and the moments along the way. I’ve learned to look at things in real time, and to start living in the moment.”  Yoni pauses again, eager to show Hakaras Hatov. “I want to thank everyone who wrote to me, and visited me, and everyone who has been with me along this journey. I’m so thankful that Hashem stopped me, and put the brakes on me,it gave me a chance to see what’s happening around me. Now that I’m back on my feet, and I can jump and run, and be on stage and dance, I take every moment as a gift.”  The Energizer Bunny, as he is nicknamed, is back and you can expect lots more music to follow, and of course a third album. In the meantime, Yoni reminds us, “It’s not only about what’s happening next. It’s also about what’s happening now.”  After releasing two holiday songs, one for Purim and Chanukah, and then a beautiful song for children of special needs, this is his first original new music since that accident.  A year later, on the eve of the anniversary, Yoni held a Seudas Hoda’ah and is releasing a brand new single titled ‘Hakol Letova’ speaking about the highs and lows of the year that passed and how ultimately, everything Hashem does is for the best, in this sure-to-be summer anthem.  When asked time and time again if he would write about the events that occurred, Yoni responded, “I would only write a song about this if it brought Simcha and smiles to people’s faces, as I remain forever in their debt for Davening so much for me and learning to never take anything in life for granted.”  VIDEO: YONI Z – HAKOL LETOVA  Written and Composed by Yoni Z  Arranged and mixed by Yoni Z and Jason Goldglancz  Additional lyrics by Aryella Korn and Yael Guenoun  Vocals recorded, engineered at Jason Goldglancz studios, Woodmere NY  Mastered by Shua Sorcher  Graphic Design: Yossi Zigelboum  Special thanks to Shloimy Zaltzman  Lyrics:  עברה שנה קצת לא פשוטה  תקופות של תקווה וגם דאגה  היו לי רגעים  זה מסלול החיים  אבל קול שקט בלב לחש לי מבפנים  כל העולם הוא גשר צר  ויודעים שהעיקר לא לפחד כלל  אז זכור ת׳אמונה  מה דעביד רחמנה  כי כל מה שקורה ׳גם זו לטובה׳!  ואוו! שכח מכל הפחד  ואוו! קח ת׳כל בנחת  ואוו! אז בא נשיר ביחד  הכל הכל לטובה  ואוו! שכח מכל הפחד  ואוו! קח ת׳כל בנחת  ואוו! אז בא נשיר ביחד  הכל הכל לטובה!  צועד קדימה  כי בך בטחתי  בוחר באמונה  כי בחיים לא שכחתי  שאתה תמיד איתי בכל פסיעותי  מבוקר ועד ערב אתה נר לרגלי  יש מעלי אבא ששומע  מחזיק אותי חזק ולא עוזב לרגע  ולפעמים כשזה נראה שכלום לא הולך  מה שלא אבין היום אני יבין בהמשך  ואוו! שכח מכל הפחד  ואוו! קח ת׳כל בנחת  ואוו! אז בא נשיר ביחד  הכל הכל לטובה  אוו! שכח מכל הפחד  ואוו! קח ת׳כל בנחת  ואוו! אז בא נשיר ביחד  הכל הכל לטובה!

Montreal Moore, 31, entered a guilty plea to a third-degree felony charge of failure to stop after an accident before Judge Maureen Sweeney.  A sentencing date has not been set yet.  Moore is accused of leaving a Sept. 7 accident where a pedestrian, Jokan Vuckovic of Poland, was struck and killed by a vehicle in the 300 block of East Indianola Avenue.  When police arrived, they found Vuckovic on the side of the road with several injuries. He died later at St. Elizabeth Health Center.  Moore was indicted Jan. 5 by a grand jury.  Assistant Prosecutor Mike Yacovone, who presented the case to the grand jury, said Moore could not face charges for Vuckovic’s death because, since he left the scene of the accident and wasn’t questioned until days or weeks later, there was no evidence he was drunk or driving recklessly when Vuckovic was hit.  Additionally, Vuckovic had a history of walking in the street and there was no way to know if he somehow walked in front of the vehicle that hit him with no warning or was not able to be seen, Yacovone said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndrYm4uY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9tYW4tcGxlYWRzLWd1aWx0eS10by1sZWF2aW5nLXNjZW5lLW9mLWZhdGFsLWFjY2lkZW50L9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndrYm4uY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9tYW4tcGxlYWRzLWd1aWx0eS10by1sZWF2aW5nLXNjZW5lLW9mLWZhdGFsLWFjY2lkZW50L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Many were routine – he knew who was going to win and how they were going to win. But sometimes things don’t always go as planned – even in real life.  This past weekend, Goldberg suffered an accident while he was doing something that had also become routine to him, using his tractor.  SUPER GLUED HIS HEAD WOUND SHUT!  The 56-year-old former five-time WCW and WWE Champion posted a photo on his Instagram on Monday that showed him bleeding pretty good from his head along with blood surrounding his right eye.  “Tpost: 1, Goldberg: 0,” the wrestling superstar wrote. A tpost is a type of fence post that is usually made out of steel.  TMZ Sports was able to get in touch with a representative for Goldberg who described the injury as the former wrestler “accidentally knocking his noggin on his tractor,” which “opened up a big gash near his forehead.”  Well, that’s good news, especially because of the many fans who were worried when they heard tractor accident. Plenty had to be praying Goldberg’s accident wasn’t something like that of which actor Jeremy Renner endured with a horrific snow plowing accident this winter.  Show some respect to @Goldberg. He’s one of the most iconic wrestlers ever. pic.twitter.com/rlj6iyLkVy — Savo Babicic (@TheOneIn1000000) August 18, 2020  Goldberg’s rep said that he’ll be fine and that he was planning to “super glue” his head wound closed while anyone else would probably be in the emergency room demanding immediate action.  The bottom line is, whether it’s The Rock, Hulk Hogan, or a damn tractor, there isn’t anything that’s getting in the way of Goldberg doing what he wants… even perhaps, a return to the wrestling ring in the near term.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm91dGtpY2suY29tL2dvbGRiZXJnLXN1ZmZlcnMtaGVhZC13b3VuZC1ibG9vZGllcy1mYWNlLWluLXRyYWN0b3ItYWNjaWRlbnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

All proceeds will go to help Parks’ parents with medical expenses.  Individual tickets cost $20, though people can purchase six for $100, according to Erica Tyson, Parks’ aunt who is organizing the benefit.  The first prize is an AR-15 rifle, the second prize is a $500 Visa gift card, the third prize is a propane grill and the fourth prize is an outdoor fire pit. People do not have to be present to win.  Tickets can be purchased through the event page, by contacting Tyson (980-205-5985) or at the church on June 3.  There will also be a silent auction that day featuring 22 gift baskets, along with a bounce house and face painting for kids and food plates people can purchase.  As of Wednesday morning, 34 people are planning on attending while 79 people are interested, according to the Facebook page.  Tyson helped organize a benefit ride in April at Hwy 55 Burgers Shakes and Fries in Albemarle that raised about $6,000, she said. She also created a GoFundMe page, which has raised $5,500 to help Parks and her family.  Parks, who lives in the Millingport area, has already had multiple surgeries and her family is facing more than $200,000 in medical expenses, according to Tyson. She had six fractures in her pelvis and a moderate liver laceration, Tyson said.  Parks was injured in a March 24 accident along N.C. Highway 73.

There, family, students, teachers, administrators and community members gathered to share their grief, prayers and memories of the two student-athletes, who were tragically killed in a single-car accident on County Road 386 two days prior.  Andrew Sheppard, left, and Travis “TJ” Jenkins  The vigil, hosted by the boys’ classmates, marked just one of several large gatherings held in the accident’s wake. For those who attended, the event gave them a space to remember their loved ones not for the events of last weekend, but for the impact the two will have on their lives and on the community itself.  “What a great community that we get to live in and raise our children in,” said Port St. Joe High School Football Coach Tanner Jones as he looked out at those gathered. Jones had coached both Jenkins and Sheppard through their years at the high school.  Then, he turned his back to the crowd to address the gathered family members who sat behind him.  “To the parents, what a great job you did with those two boys and the men they were becoming. The impact that they made was on not just their family and their teammates, but the community as a whole. The love and outpouring that’s come out of this shows support for you all.”  Jenkins, 18, would have been entering his senior year at Port St. Joe High School in August. He is remembered not only as a stellar athlete and a strong student, but as a leader within his teams and his school and a young man deeply dedicated to his faith and to his family.  Sheppard, 16, would have been entering his junior year this fall, and his coaches say he was expected to take on leadership roles on his teams in the upcoming seasons.  Those who knew him described Sheppard as being a true problem solver and a hard worker. He was a member of both the school’s football and weightlifting teams and was known for his reserved but kind demeanor and his friendly smile.  The high school’s basketball coach, Sandy Quinn, who worked with Jenkins, led those gathered in prayer.  “We thank you for the lives of TJ and Andrew, Lord. But Lord, this community needs you more than ever. This family needs you more than ever,” he said.  “Lord, we have cried and cried and cried, and we ask why. But Lord, we know that you know. You make no mistakes. You know the way. You know the direction. So Father, we call on you tonight, Lord. We ask, we pray for your love to continue to shine on this family, on this community, Lord. We give you praise and we thank you, Lord God, for the many memories that TJ and Shep left in our lives, in this community.”  Accounts have been established for both Jenkins and Sheppard at Capital City Bank in Port St. Joe for those who wish to make donations to their families. Funds donated will go towards helping to pay for arrangements and other costs.  The account number for Jenkins is #10001223337. The account number for Sheppard is #10001223246.  Those who are making deposits from out of town are asked to make reference to the account number and address them to:  Capital City Bank — Attn: Kristi Dorman  150 Avenue A  Port St. Joe, FL 32456.  A visitation will be held for the family at Port St. Joe High School on Friday at 5 p.m., and a public viewing will be held from 6 to 8 p.m. EDT.  Funeral services will be held for both Jenkins and Sheppar in the high school’s gymnasium on Saturday, with services for Jenkins beginning at 11 a.m. EDT and services for Sheppard beginning at 3 p.m. EDT.  “The strength of our community is that we can come together in good times and in bad times,” said Preacher Dave Barkalow from the First United Methodist Church of Port St. Joe, who prayed with students in the school’s commons on Sunday following the news of Jenkins and Sheppard’s deaths.  “… I wish there were magic words, words we could just say to make everything better, but there aren’t. We live in a broken world. We live in a world where sometimes wonderful, beautiful things happen and where sometimes difficult, painful things happen. So as we gather here today, we pray that a spirit of comfort, a spirit of community, a spirit of love may mark us to give us the courage to be sad and to mourn and the courage to speak of the good times and the fond memories.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vZ3VsZmNvdW50eS5uZXdzLzIwMjMvMDUvMjMvcG9ydC1zdC1qb2UtY29tbXVuaXR5LW1vdXJucy0yLXN0dWRlbnQtYXRobGV0ZXMtbG9zdC1pbi1zYXR1cmRheS1uaWdodC1hY2NpZGVudC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The minister’s proposals include harsher drunk or drug driving penalties, speed limit changes, and road education for young people. Regarding scooters, new speed limits and compulsory number plates could be introduced.  “For those who use scooters: helmet, registration, insurance and good manners”, said Deputy Prime Minister and League (ID) leader Matteo Salvini.  “There were 3,120 deaths on Italian roads last year. This is impossible: we will work on a new highway code”, he announced.  Salvini’s statements come in the wake of the latest tragedy in Rome: a 24-year-old young man was run over and killed by a van while riding home on a scooter. This is the 58th victim since the beginning of the year.  The surge in e-scooter use started during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, and within a year, the number of accidents quadrupled, often caused by driving too fast (36%).  From 2020 to 2021, according to the National Institute of Statistics (Istat), road accidents involving e-scooters rose from 564 to 2,101 and injuries from 518 to 1,980. Of these, 1,903 were drivers, 77 passengers and 127 pedestrians. In 2021, there were 10 victims, one of whom was a pedestrian.  The number of accidents with bikes (691 in 2021 compared to 240 in 2020) and fatalities (13 in 2021 compared to 6 in 2020) also tripled.  ISTAT data also show that in Italy, in 2021, only 13% of electric scooter users previously travelled by car. Before the advent of scooters, most users travelled on foot, by bicycle or public transport.

Bystander, Levan Vashakidze, told Norwood News by phone that the accident occurred at around 1.40 p.m. on Monday, May 22. When Norwood News visited the crash site later on Monday afternoon, a police car and a scooter were seen, along with some blood stains on the road beside the scooter, which was upright and located next to a pillar supporting the elevated train track over Jerome Avenue.  According to police radio transmissions heard that day, it was reported at around 1.44 p.m. that a driver of a scooter had apparently been hit by a truck and that the truck had fled the scene. However, at 1.56 p.m., according to the police radio transmissions, responding officers reportedly said bystanders reported that the scooter driver wasn’t hit by a truck and that he had allegedly been “popping wheelies” [elevating the scooter onto its back wheel while still in motion] and had run into one of the pillars supporting the elevated train track, serving the 4 line.  According to police radio transmissions, the victim was treated at St. Barnabas Hospital. Norwood News contacted both the FDNY and the NYPD for any details about the incident and both departments reported not having any information about it.  As reported, in the same vicinity, 10 days earlier on Friday, May 12, at 6.10 a.m. at least one person was injured in a two-vehicle, high-speed collision involving an MTA bus and a car on Jerome Avenue by East 198th Street, one block from the above-mentioned collision, also in Bedford Park, at 6.10 a.m. Vashakidze, who works in the area, also witnessed the previous collision, as reported at the time.

In his Instagram account, Gab posted photos of his accident, saying he was swiped by an SUV (sports utility vehicle) while running at 75 miles per hour.  “TRIGGER WARNING: BLOOD. Last Tuesday, my Tito Ranier and I spoke about me speaking and sharing my testimony in his church. A couple of moments after I left to go to him, this happened. I got side swiped on the freeway by an suv at around 75mph which launched me a good 70ft away from the collision. I was in full gear but because of the force of the impact and momentum, it burned through my jacket and pants,” Gab wrote.  “This is the first accident in my entire life that I did not expect or see coming. Been riding for close to two decades and still, new unexpected experiences to learn from,” he added.  He thanked all the drivers and the officers who helped him.  “Also exchanged numbers in case I needed assistance later on. Esp @pumpkin_600 who I just met due to this incident and he stopped and stayed with me for a bit. Thank you bro!  “I also want to commend all the firemen, police officers and EMTs who were professional, efficient and kind. I have never felt so safe after a major accident.  “Thank you also to all my friends, family and loved ones for all the messages of encouragement and love, here and in Manila. I love you all!!” he added.  He also thanked his uncle for taking care of him while he is away from his parents.  “Lastly, I want to say thank you to my Tito Ranier who picked me up in the hospital and took care of me for the first few days. It’s been very tough moving around especially at night considering I have gashes on my lower and upper back, so sleeping has been tough too but all is well. Slowly but surely,” he said.  “Today is Sunday and by God’s grace, I was able to speak and share my life story. With my family by my side. In all things God works for the good of those who love Him. May God bless you all today and keep you and your loved ones safe out there. All is well in His name,” he added.

He claimed his client was at a normal speed at the time of the accident that “occurred as a motorcycle suddenly came in front of the vehicle”.Police told the court they needed further remand to match the route of the accused on the day of accident with his call detail record. Police said they needed to interrogate him to know about persons who had helped him to hide or provided shelter for three days after the accident. Sources said the accused had allegedly stayed with his friend whose father had retired from the UT police department.

"accident","2023-04-13","Not Discerned","{""DauphinCounty"", ""Pennsylvania"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T09:14:17","Brian Whipkey  Pennsylvania Outdoors Columnist  Two people have died in Pennsylvania boating accidents already in 2023, and the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission wants to curb the chances for more fatalities with one primary piece of advice: Wear a life jacket.  The first boat-related fatality investigated by the commission involved an 18-year-old man, who died after his 10-foot rowboat capsized March 18 on Lake Henry in Wayne County. Two other passengers survived. No one aboard was wearing a life jacket.  On April 13, a 65-year-old man died on the Susquehanna River in Dauphin County after the motor of his 12-foot boat stalled and the boat went over the Dock Stream Dam. The victim wasn’t wearing a life jacket when he was found, but witnesses believe he was wearing one when the accident happened. A passenger, wearing a life jacket, survived the accident.  “One of the things you want to make sure you have every time you go out on the water, most importantly, is your life jacket,” said Tyler Crooks, Pennsylvania Fish and Boat waterways conservation officer in Somerset County.  There were a record low number of boating accidents, 41, in 2022 that resulted in nine fatalities across the state. The 10-year average is 60 accidents and 11 deaths.  “A lot of things that we find that cause accidents out on the water are people being distracted by friends and family and not keeping your eye out over the water like you should,” Crooks said. He also points out that boaters need to be defensive and pay attention where other boats are going.  Another cause of accidents involves driving a boat while under the influence of alcohol.  “BUI, boating under the influence, is a major issue. It’s the same as driving a car. If you are under the influence of alcohol, you are going to have worse reaction time and poor decision-making when you are trying to steer your craft,"" he said.  The officers are monitoring boaters to help keep them and other members of the public safe.  “If we want to do a safety check, we’re going to be looking for things like properly fitting life jackets, one on board for every person that’s on your boat,” Crooks said.  Not all life jackets are the same.  To be compliant with Pennsylvania regulations, a person’s life jacket needs to have a label reflecting that it is U.S. Coast Guard approved. The vest should also be the right size for the passenger's age and body size.  There are a variety of styles of life jackets on the market to make them comfortable for boaters and kayakers. Some are small inflatable models that don’t have the bulk of more traditional life jackets.  In addition, depending on the size of the boat, operators are required to have a fire extinguisher, a throwable flotation device and a sound producing device like a bell, horn or whistle.  The more you know:If you find young wild animals, here's what you need to know to keep them and you safe  Better fishing ahead:Several lakes across Pennsylvania receive enhancements for fishing, erosion control  Incredible trophy:Pa. fisherman shares why his trophy rainbow trout is not the state's new record  Boat safety guidelines  Boaters are encouraged to follow a checklist of basic safety guidelines before and during each boating adventure, including:  Always wear a life jacket  Never boat while impaired by alcohol or drugs  Have a float plan to let someone know when and where you will be boating  Check the weather forecast for storms and high water conditions  Take a boating safety course  Have proper registrations or launch permits for your boat  The boating summary guide that comes with a fishing license provides the safety requirements for different sizes of boats.

"accident","2019-01-23","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-23T20:50:00","The former safety manager at the Signal Peak Energy LLC underground coal mine near Roundup was sentenced Tuesday for conspiring to make false reports about a mine accident in which an employee had his fingers crushed, resulting in partial amputation.  Curtis Floyd, 47, of Billings, was sentenced to two years of probation and fined $2,000, said U.S. Attorney Jesse Laslovich. Floyd pleaded guilty in January to an information charging him with conspiracy to submit false statements in mine records.  In a plea agreement reached in the case, the parties agreed that a term of probation was appropriate. U.S. District Judge Dana L. Christensen presided.  “As Signal Peak Energy’s safety manager, Floyd had a duty to make sure miners were safe and protected and to document and report accidents. Floyd not only failed the miners, but he also flaunted mandatory mine health and safety reporting regulations. We expect mines and their managers to operate in compliance with all regulations, and when they don’t, they will be held accountable,” U.S. Attorney Laslovich said.  “The Mine Safety and Health Administration relies on accurate and timely reporting data to inform our investigations and address safety and health hazards. These reports also help mine operators uphold their legal obligation to keep miners safe and healthy by advising the industry of necessary changes to prevent future incidents. Floyd’s failure to report this data undercuts this system and puts miners at risk. We thank the Department of Justice for its vigorous enforcement of the Mine Act and helping MSHA protect the nation’s miners,” said Assistant Secretary for Mine Safety and Health Chris Williamson.  The government alleged in court documents that in 2018, Floyd was the safety manager at the Signal Peak Energy coal mine and was responsible for overseeing safety-related accidents and injuries, ensuring that all such incidents were properly reported as required by federal law.  Instead, the government alleged, Floyd went along when management needed an accident covered up. Floyd dropped off injured miners at the hospital instead of escorting them inside or let them go home, knowing they would lie to doctors about how they got hurt, and he let required safety reports disappear instead of making sure the reports were filed.  In early 2018, John Doe 1, a miner, had his fingers crushed while loading mining materials. The injury eventually required partial amputation. As Floyd was taking John Doe 1 to the hospital, Dale Musgrave, the former vice president of underground operations, called the injured miner and directed him to falsely claim that the injury was unrelated to his work.  Musgrave told John Doe 1 that he would make it worth his while. Floyd told John Doe 1 he would support whatever decision was made. The injured miner agreed to not report the incident. Floyd and Musgrave were required to complete a U.S. Department of Labor Mine Safety and Health Administration Mine Accident, Injury and Illness report, but they never completed or submitted a report for this incident. They also failed to report John Doe 1’s injury on another MSHA quarterly report.  “Protecting the health and safety of our nation’s miners requires a team effort, which starts with mine operators following crucial safety and health laws and regulations. When mine operators violate their obligations or attempt to cheat the system, the Department of Labor will not hesitate to use every available tool to uphold the law, including partnering with other agencies. We are grateful for the Department of Justice’s critical partnership to keep all our nation’s miners safe,” said Solicitor of Labor Seema Nanda.  In February, a rock wall in the mine collapsed injuring three miners. One of the miners, whose leg was trapped under rock, was flown to a Billings hospital. The other two men were less severely injured. One was driven to Billings by ambulance, the other by private vehicle.  MSHA has yet to file a report on the incident.  Floyd's prosecution was part of a broad corruption investigation into Signal Peak Energy’s management and operations that resulted in criminal misdemeanor convictions of the company for willful violation of health and safety standards and felony convictions of some former mine managers and associates for embezzlement, tax evasion, bank fraud, money laundering, drugs and firearms violations. Musgrave was sentenced to probation and fined $20,000 for his conviction in the case.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Colin M. Rubich, Zeno B. Baucus and Timothy Tatarka prosecuted the case. The IRS Criminal Investigation, FBI, Department of Labor and Environmental Protection Agency conducted the investigation.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFodHRwczovL2JpbGxpbmdzZ2F6ZXR0ZS5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9leC1zaWduYWwtcGVhay1zYWZldHktbWFuYWdlci1zZW50ZW5jZWQtaW4tY2FzZS1pbnZvbHZpbmctYWNjaWRlbnQtY292ZXJ1cC9hcnRpY2xlXzZmNzA0ODhjLWY5YTgtMTFlZC04ZGY4LTlmOTAxYmQ2YTBkZC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The reported incident took place shortly after 3 p.m. on Monday, May 22, when witnesses saw a high-speed chase involving state troopers. The chase came to an end at the corner of Sierra Vista and Ejido with the vehicle crashing into a family’s fence and several individuals seen fleeing from the vehicle.

Councilmember for District 1, Gilbert Gonzalez said, ”There’s a traffic light coming in Sierra Vista and Ejido pretty soon, but you see, traffic is not the problem. Traffic is a problem, but now, chases have become a new problem, a modern problem that did not exist before.” Despite the promise of a traffic light installation, the mother suggests the implementation of speed bumps as an alternative solution, pointing to the lack of respect drivers in the area show towards road signage.

"accident","2006-07-12","14:00:00","{""Newark"", ""NewJersey"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T18:12:49","The injuries sustained by victims of motorcycle accidents can range from minor wounds to fatalities. While a car or truck passenger has some protection in the vehicle and its safety features, a motorcyclist only has their helmet and protective gear. In an accident, a motorcyclist can be thrown or dragged without anything between their bodies and the road. This often leads to severe and life-changing injuries.  Common Motorcycle Accident Injuries  In this article, we take a look at some of the most common injuries in motorcycle accidents in Delaware and across the country.  Broken Bones or Fractures  Broken or fractured bones are common in any vehicle accident and are very common in motorcycle accidents. When a motorcyclist has to stop suddenly, the rider can be ejected, or thrown, from their motorcycle, and is often launched through the air. Inexperienced riders are even more likely to be thrown over the handlebars of their motorcycle in this kind of brake dive.  A rider who suffers a broken leg, arm, elbow, ribs, or other bones requires medical treatment and sometimes orthopedic surgery. Casts are typically worn for at least 6 weeks during which the recovering victim may be unable to work their usual job. Follow-up appointments and physical therapy may also interrupt a victim’s normal working hours.  Another common fracture in a motorcycle injury is a skull fracture, particularly if the rider was not wearing a helmet. A skull fracture is a serious, and sometimes fatal, head injury.  Head trauma or Brain Injury  Head trauma can happen when a motorcyclist suffers the impact of a crash or ejection on their head or face. It can cause a skull fracture, traumatic brain injury (T.B.I.), concussion, brain hemorrhage (bleeding), seizures, and paralysis. Many of these injuries can lead to long periods of treatment, hospitalization, and life-altering physical or emotional changes. If you have been in a motorcycle crash and you have suffered a head injury or have symptoms of a head trauma, such as a headache, nausea or vomiting, dilated pupils, or seizures, you should seek medical attention immediately.  Lacerations  Lacerations in a motorcycle accident are often seen on the face, arms, or torso of a motorcyclist. If the rider is wearing protective gear, it can protect the upper and lower body but a rider’s face is usually always exposed. Lacerations will require a visit to the emergency room for stitches, at least, and may require surgery and hospitalization. They also carry an increased risk of infection which can lead to further complications. Even after medical treatment, lacerations can cause permanent scarring and disfigurement. Lacerations to the face are particularly sensitive and may cause significant mental anxiety for a victim, on top of the physical harm that they have suffered.  Road Rash and Abrasions  Road rash is suffered by motorcyclists when their skin is scraped off as they are thrown across the surface of the road. It is a severe type of abrasion or friction burn. Road rash can happen even when a rider is traveling at low speeds, and are often suffered by bicyclists too. Wearing protective gear can reduce the risk and intensity of road rash.  Like burns, road rash is graded by severity. First-degree road rash, or minor abrasions, can heal within a few weeks but severe, third-degree road rash completely strips the skin exposing the underlying fat and tissue, and may require skin grafts, cause nerve damage, and leave permanent scarring. Any road rash is painful and, like all open wounds, carries a risk of infection.  Burns  A burn is a very painful and treatment-intensive injury. Burns should be treated immediately at the scene of an accident, with follow-up in the emergency room and beyond, as medically indicated. Burns can lead to scarring, disfigurement, and infection. They can also cause emotional distress for a victim, both from the initial pain and trauma of the accident and the long-term effects of disfigurement.  Internal Organ Damage and Bleeding  Not all injuries are immediately visible. Many major motorcycle injuries are internal, such as a lacerated spleen, liver injury, or punctured lung. A motorcyclist who has been involved in an accident should always be assessed for internal injuries. An impact to the abdomen, often suffered in a motorcycle accident, will frequently lead to such injuries.  Internal organ damage can require immediate surgery, hospitalization, and a lengthy recovery period. During this time, a victim will miss work and incur many medical expenses from surgeon fees to prescription medications, and should be compensated for these losses.  Amputations  When someone loses a limb in a motorcycle accident, or it has to be amputated as a result of the injuries sustained in the accident, the victim’s life is changed forever. In the immediate accident aftermath, they will require surgery, hospitalization, physical therapy, and, perhaps, counseling. As they leave hospital and return to their everyday life, they may require modifications to their home or vehicle, and may not be able to return to their job because of their injuries.  Back and Neck injuries  Injuries to the back, neck, and spinal cord are very common in vehicle accidents. A spinal cord injury can be particularly devastating as it is associated with nerve damage, paralysis, incontinence, respiratory problems, and sexual dysfunction. A seemingly minor back injury sustained in a motorcycle accident should not be ignored. Many victims complain of minor back and neck issues after an accident that develop into severe or chronic issues.  Mental or Emotional Trauma  A motorcycle accident is a very traumatic event, and the mental distress that can be caused by an accident should not be discounted. In addition, a victim’s injuries, such as amputation, disfigurement, burns, and scarring, can be a lifelong problem, physically and mentally. Victims may suffer depression, anxiety, PTSD, or other psychological trauma. If you have been involved in a motorcycle accident, you may need to seek professional help for your mental as well as your physical injuries.  What Should You Do If You Are Injured In a Motorcycle Accident?  If you have been injured in a motorcycle accident, the first and most important thing to remember is to seek medical help. Call 911 for an ambulance if you need emergency assistance, or go to the emergency room or your regular provider for evaluation. Keep a copy of your medical reports, discharge paperwork, and medical bills.  If you are able at the time of the accident, you should take photos and/or videos of the road and weather conditions, vehicle positions, and other relevant information. Your smartphone is also an easy way to record insurance information, vehicle registration, witness contact details, and other evidence and information that may be helpful to your claim.  An attorney will explain your right to compensation after a motorcycle accident and help you get the maximum compensation you deserve for your injuries.  Will You Get Compensation For Your Injuries in a Motorcycle Accident?  An innocent victim of a motorcycle accident deserves compensation for all of the injuries and losses that they sustain in an accident, and by law they are entitled to recover the damages caused by someone else’s negligence. These damages would include past medical expenses, future medical care, lost wages and benefits, home and vehicle modifications, damage to your motorcycle, and an amount to compensate you for your physical pain and mental trauma (known as “pain and suffering.”) Unfortunately, an insurance company is a for profit business that is incentivized to minimize losses and maximize profits. This means that an injured victim typically has to fight for the full and fair compensation that they deserve and are legally entitled to after a motorcycle accident.

When you are dealing with powerful insurance companies after a motorcycle accident, it is easy to accept a lowball settlement offer that seems like a lot of money but does not in reality cover all of your expenses and losses into the future.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpkc3VwcmEuY29tL2xlZ2FsbmV3cy93aGF0LWFyZS1jb21tb24taW5qdXJpZXMtaW4tYS0zOTc0NTMxL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(KXII) - 32-year-old, Shay Grove, was riding his motorcycle when a driver ran a stop sign causing Grove to hit his car at the intersection of River Rd. and Winnett Rd in Colbert last Friday afternoon.  His wife, Rochelle Grove, said his bike ended up in the middle of the intersection while he was launched into a ditch along with the vehicle.  “They apparently gave him a bottle of water, called someone to come sit with him, and then left,” Rochelle Grove said.  Rochelle Grove said her family and Oklahoma Highway Patrol are now looking for this person. She identifies the driver as a male in a maroon sedan.  “I would just ask them to do the right thing and turn themselves in, I understand people make mistakes,” Rochelle Grove said, “But you can’t just leave someone and leave them to take care of a mess that you created, at least help take care of it,”  His wife said the father of two is lucky to be alive and now faces an eight-week recovery. Shay Grove has five broken ribs, 14 stitches in his face, nearly lost his eye and a back injury.  “He has a transverse lumbar fracture all the way across all of the cartilage in the bottom of his back that meets your hips, is all broken, that will not grow back cannot be repaired,” Rochelle Grove said.

"accident","2023-05-05","Not Discerned","{""Dallas"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T18:58:08","An 8-year-old Texas boy riding in a truck with his mother on Friday afternoon was killed in an accident after a truck allegedly blew a stop sign at an intersection, striking the vehicle carrying the child.  The boy, Thomas Berry, was pronounced dead after being transported to a hospital in Dallas while his mother, 48-year-old Tara Lynn Wright-Berry, was taken to a local hospital in Canton, Texas, with non-life-threatening injuries.  Police say the accident happened 11 miles southwest of Canton and that the driver of the other truck, Miguel Castro-Govea, 31, was arrested for allegedly causing the crash. He was first taken to the same Canton hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.  The driver was charged with criminal negligent homicide and is being held in the Van Zandt County Jail, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety. It's not immediately clear if he has entered a plea or retained an attorney.  Both vehicles were 2017 pickup trucks, say authorities.  Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage? Sign up for PEOPLE's free True Crime newsletter for breaking crime news, ongoing trial coverage and details of intriguing unsolved cases.  Meanwhile, the Berry family is mourning the loss of a son they say loved baseball.  “Thomas was on the Canton Astros coach pitch baseball team,” the family said in a GoFundMe page, which has raised tens of thousands of dollars in recent days to aid the family. “He was excited to play on the team because his favorite color was orange. He loved playing with his teammates and had found a new spot as the Astros catcher.”  Tara said her son “was so excited about baseball this year that he even slept in his hat and jersey some nights,” according to the fundraiser page, which noted the crash took place near the family’s home.  Jenny Wells-Fain, who helped coach Thomas’ team and launched the GoFundMe to support the family, tells PEOPLE she remembers Thomas “had a great attitude about everything.”  He was also brave, his coach says, recalling a time when the team needed someone to play catcher last-minute: “Thomas threw his hand up and said, ‘I would like to do it!’ “ she remembers.  “He always had a positive attitude and he was the ultra caring type of kid,” Wells-Fain says. “Always very funny, but just very sweet to everybody.”  Thomas’ team played their first game without him Monday night, which Wells-Fain says became more of a “beautiful tribute” than a usual little league game. The team hung Thomas’ jersey up in the dugout, while one of his two older sisters led the group around the bases so he could symbolically score the team’s first run. Before the game, Wells-Fain says their opponents walked over each carrying an orange rose – the color of Thomas’ Canton Astros team – and the kids shared memories about him before the first pitch.  “It wasn’t just our team that was affected,” she says. “This is a small community where everybody on every team knew him. There's only one elementary school in Canton, Texas, so all of those kids are going to the same school, so there's a lot of players on the other teams that were very close friends with Thomas. It affected our community as a whole.”  The community has stepped up to help the family too, with many neighbors dropping off groceries and household supplies.  The Canton Youth Recreation Association said on Facebook that it will host a benefit baseball tournament in June, with “only one goal and that is to raise as much money to help the Berry family in a time that we wish on no one.”  Police say an investigation into the crash is still ongoing. It was a cloudy day, but road conditions were listed as dry, according to the Texas Department of Safety report. Both Thomas and his mother were wearing their seatbelts, the report says.  A funeral for Thomas will be held Sunday in Canton.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlLmNvbS90ZXhhcy1ib3ktOC1raWxsZWQtaW4tY2FyLWFjY2lkZW50LTc1MDE3NTLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Goldberg is most famous for his streak that occurred when he made his professional wrestling debut in WCW, and proceeded to go 173-0.  After more than a decade away from WWE, Goldberg returned to the ring in 2016, and had matches with Brock Lesnar, Kevin Owens, Bray Wyatt, Drew McIntyre, the Undertaker and Roman Reigns.

A full investigation into the collision remains ongoing at this time.  Liability For White Creek Car Accidents  Car accidents are one of the leading causes of serious injury and death in the United States. According to the Centers For Disease Control, “Reducing motor vehicle crash deaths was one of the great public health achievements of the 20th century for the US. However, more than 32,000 people are killed and 2 million are injured each year from motor vehicle crashes.” Larger vehicles can be particularly dangerous for a number of reasons.  They have a high center of gravity and are more prone to tipping over.  Larger vehicles weigh more and are more prone to breaking down if not properly maintained.  Larger vehicles have large blind spots that can obscure the presence of smaller vehicles.  Any person that is injured in a car accident may have legal recourse through a bodily injury claim. Damages in a civil claim can help cover lost wages, medical bills and pain and suffering. It is extremely important that evidence is properly preserved after an accident. A personal injury attorney can examine all of the unique facts of your case and let you know what your legal options are.  Investigating A New York Car Accident  We at Gersowitz Libo & Korek, P.C. extend our best wishes to all of the people injured in this collision.

Petty Officer First Class Erik White, a machinery technician, Petty Officer First Class William Collins, a boatswain’s mate, and Petty Officer First Class Joseph Walp, an electrician’s mate, responded to the collision. They are stationed at U.S. Coast Guard Maritime Safety and Security Team Seattle (91101).  The three members were returning to Coast Guard Base Seattle after their lunch break when they saw dark smoke. The crew parked to investigate. Two cars had collided and one of the cars turned over in the collision. White, Collins, and Walp assisted emergency services in recovering the individual in the turned over vehicle.  During the rescue, White climbed onto the vehicle and used a hammer to break the window.  “After arriving on scene, we knew it was bad and immediately jumped into action,” said White. “I quickly assessed how to free the trapped passenger and planned how to get him out safely and quickly. After we got him out and to safety, it was clear he needed medical attention. We conducted first aid and monitored him until emergency services arrived.”  Collins and Walp assisted White in pulling the individual out of the vehicle and transferring him to emergency medical services.  “When we smelled the fuel and saw it leaking onto the hot exhaust system, we knew we needed to act quickly. I jumped up on the van and helped Erick pull the guy from his van and got him off and to the side as fast as we could. I was terrified that if I didn’t act that something bad would happen to the trapped passenger, we had to get him out and to safety,” said Collins.  Walp also assessed the situation to make sure everyone on scene was safe.  “I checked the other vehicle for passengers and cleared away the bystanders. The hazardous cargo in the van and the leaking fuel could have created a much bigger accident and injured a lot more people making it crucial that they stay back,” said Walp.  “Coast Guardsman possess an innate, unwavering drive to rescue and protect those in need,” said Lt. Karrie A Jeffries, the executive officer of MSST Seattle. “Their commitment to saving the individual exemplify the highest standards of integrity and selflessness. I’m proud of my team and they absolutely embody our core values of honor, respect, and devotion to duty.”  The Coast Guard trains to respond to dangerous situations, to aid those in need and protect people in any emergency. These Coast Guardsmen are commended for their willingness to go above and beyond the call of duty and being first responders on and off the clock.  -USCG-","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MudXNjZy5taWwvUHJlc3MtUmVsZWFzZXMvQXJ0aWNsZS8zNDA1MTc1L2NvYXN0LWd1YXJkLW1lbWJlcnMtcmVzY3VlLW1hbi1mcm9tLWNhci1hY2NpZGVudC1pbi1zZWF0dGxlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

A public celebration of life has been scheduled for 12 p.m. Friday at the gardens.  Courtesy image  A public celebration of life has been scheduled for Eagle County local Nick Courtens on Friday from noon to 2 p.m. at the Betty Ford Alpine Gardens in Vail.  Courtens, 34, the garden’s curator of plant collections, died in a paddling accident in Glenwood Canyon on Sunday.  Garfield County Coroner Robert Glassmire confirmed Tuesday morning to the Glenwood Springs Post Independent that Courtens was pronounced dead at the scene between Shoshone and Grizzly Creek in Glenwood Canyon after he fell from a raft and drowned.  Courtens was born on March 14, 1989, in New York, the oldest in a family of three children. He was connected to horticulture from a young age through his family’s farm, Roxbury Farm, in the Hudson Valley of New York.  Courtens studied horticulture at the Longwood Gardens professional gardener program and came to Colorado for a summer internship at Betty Ford Alpine Gardens in May of 2010. He remained on staff following the internship, ultimately becoming the curator. He also joined Ski and Snowboard Club Vail in 2012 as a coach.  Support Local Journalism Donate    The Betty Ford Alpine Gardens described Courtens as a rising star in North American horticulture, and Ski and Snowboard Club Vail said he was a significant contributor to the freeski and snowboard community in Vail.  Those closest to Courtens knew him as a dependable friend who took the lead in helping to plan the celebrations of life for Bindu Pomery and Lily Connelly, who were both killed in backcountry snowboard and ski accidents in Vail. He was also deeply affected by the death of his friend Spencer Cooke, a Vail local who died in 2015.  Courtens was himself a talented backcountry skier and also enjoyed mountain biking, fly-fishing and whitewater rafting. He was a world traveler who ventured to Alaska for heli-skiing, Central America for sightseeing, and Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan for mountain trekking in an effort to learn more about high-altitude horticulture.  In recent years, Courtens had branched out into public speaking and had been featured at several presentations for plant societies and botanic gardens. In April he visited Vancouver, Canada, where he studied plants and gardens and participated in speaking engagements.  Courtens is survived by his parents, Kelly Testa and Jean-Paul Courtens, brother Johannes Courtens, sister Annie Courtens, stepmother Jody Bolluyt, grandmothers Meg Cashen and Corrie Courtens-Soonius, as well as many aunts, uncles and cousins.  Friday’s celebration of life will take place on the lawn at the lower bench of the Betty Ford Alpine Gardens location, adjacent to the gardens.  Members of the public are welcome to attend and are encouraged to park in the Vail Village parking structure and bring blankets or lawn chairs.  Pictures of Courtens will be shared at the event, and those who have pictures they wish to share can upload them to dedicated folders which have been set up on Dropbox and Google Drive .  There will also be a visitation from 5-7 p.m. on Thursday at the Vail Interfaith Chapel.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhaWxkYWlseS5jb20vbmV3cy9jZWxlYnJhdGlvbi1vZi1saWZlLWZvci1uaWNrLWNvdXJ0ZW5zLXNldC1mb3ItZnJpZGF5LWF0LWJldHR5LWZvcmQtYWxwaW5lLWdhcmRlbnMtaW4tdmFpbC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"accident","2023-09-11","Not Discerned","{""Prescott"", ""Arizona"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-24T03:29:00","PHOENIX (3TV/CBS 5) - A well-known 27-year-old influencer is recovering in the hospital after suffering a traumatic head injury while working in Arizona. Her family says it happened after her horse spun and fell on top of her. She’s been in the ICU for a week, but her dad tells Arizona’s Family she is slowly making progress.  Marino Sperandeo says his daughter, Emmie, will soon be moving into the neurological ward, where she will go through extensive physical therapy. He says the accident happened just a month after she was thrown from a bucking horse that left her with a concussion and a broken finger.  Sperandeo says Emmie has always had a love for animals. He says she was inspired by Western living and her social media knowledge, which drove her to become an influencer. “Pretty much all of her income is derived from social media efforts,” he said.  Thousands have been following her journey for several years. She’s traveled and worked in several different continents, countries and states. Most recently, she was sharing her journey from Montana to Arizona. But last week, her dad says Emmie was involved in an accident involving one of her horses. “She was holding on to the horse and was whip lashed by the horse as it fell sideways. That caused her head to hit the floor,” he said.  Sperandeo says her horse fell on top of her and fractured her head in two different places. “It hit hard enough that people from 100 yards away could hear the impact of her head on the ground,” he said.  Right now, he says all she can remember are memories from 7 to 14 years ago. Another aspect that has her family worried is that by law, she was dropped from her family’s insurance after turning 26. “She’s 27 now and since then she got dropped off my insurance probably less than a year ago. When that happened I don’t know if she went out and got the Affordable Care Act or got Medicare or supplemental health insurance,” Sperandeo said.  While there are so many questions about financials and recovery, Emmie’s dad says there is no doubt her hundreds of thousands of followers have provided love and support. “She’s a tough kid but she’s got a long road ahead of her,” he said.  Emmie has several animals, and her family is working to figure out how to get the dog and horses from Arizona to Florida, where they live. They say her bison will most likely have to go to Montana.

"accident","2023-05-20","13:37:00","{""RanchoCordova"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T17:30:42","Three-Vehicle Car Accident on Grant Line Road Causes Injuries  A Rancho Cordova car accident involving three vehicles happened on May 20. One person involved in the collision said the cause was a vehicle that drifted into oncoming traffic. The accident happened along Grant Line Road between White Rock and Douglas Roads around 1:37 p.m.  Injuries Reported in Three-Vehicle Car Accident  A report about the accident issued by the responding California Highway Patrol (CHP) officers said the vehicles involved in the crash included a Ford F-150 pickup pulling a fifth-wheel trailer and a Honda. The individual in the Honda appeared to have suffered injuries in the crash. Two of the vehicles were left blocking the southbound lanes, while the truck and trailer blocked the west edge of the roadway. The incident is being investigated by CHP traffic accident personnel to determine the cause and to assign fault.  Why a Driver Would Suddenly Cross Into Oncoming Traffic  One of the most dangerous behaviors on the road is when a driver suddenly veers across into oncoming traffic. This can have devastating consequences, and yet it happens all too frequently. There are several potential reasons why a driver might cross into oncoming traffic and cause a car accident.  A distracted driver may not be paying attention to what is going on around them and may not realize they are about to cross the yellow line. Distractions can include texting or talking on a cell phone, putting on makeup, eating, fiddling with the radio, or any number of other activities. In these cases, the driver is simply not paying attention and their lack of focus could have deadly consequences.  Impairment can also determine why a driver might cross into oncoming traffic. Impairment includes any substance or condition that may reduce the ability of a driver to operate their vehicle safely, such as alcohol , drugs or medical issues.  Inexperience can often lead to an inexperienced driver not understanding where the yellow line is or being unable to react quickly enough when they realize they are about to cross it.  Fatigue can lead to a driver crossing into oncoming traffic if they nod off while driving.

Police were called to the area near the Marshall Street Garage, not far from the old courthouse, on Sunday night at 8:10 p.m. and found two teenagers in the area with “serious” but ultimately not life-threatening injuries, police said.  The first teenager, who is 15, suffered from a gunshot wound to his upper leg. Police suspect the gun fired when the boy put it in his waistband. However, the gun was not found. A friend of the teenager took it and left the area, according to police. What was found was a 9 mm casing.  A 14-year-old was found nearby with a stab wound to his upper back. Police currently believe that injury occurred in a separate incident from the accidental shooting.  Both teens were taken to the hospital.  This incident comes less than a month after four men and a 16-year-old boy were shot on May 7 while sitting on the curb drinking on the 400 block of Redwood Avenue. In that case, an unidentified man walked up to the group and began firing. All five were taken to the hospital with serious but not life-threatening injuries.  One year ago, attendees at Redwood City’s Fox Theater where Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai was speaking, were told to sit tight before leaving due to 150-200 teens across the street at Courthouse Square shooting off fireworks.

"accident","2022-12-01","Not Discerned","{""NewYork"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T00:07:37","The year 2022 marked the year that drug tests administered after workplace accidents showing positive results for marijuana reached the highest level in 25 years, according to a recent Quest Diagnostics analysis.  The Quest Diagnostics analysis, unveiled Thursday, showed that positive marijuana urine tests after workplace accidents among the general U.S. workforce hit 7.3% last year. In 2021, it was slightly lower at 6.7%.  For its entire analysis, Quest Diagnostics looked at more than 10.6 million drug test results. Those results, which had a timeframe of January to December 2022, came from urine, hair and oral-fluid drug tests.  The higher percentage had a correspondence with the move by some states to make usage of marijuana legal, the workplace drug testing provider suggested.  A total of 22 states have made recreational marijuana use legal, with Colorado and Washington state having led the way starting 11 years ago. Included in the states that have done so are California, Arizona and Massachusetts, among others. D.C. has legalized it as well.  MEDICAL MARIJUANA DISPENSARIES OPEN IN GEORGIA: ‘IMPROVED QUALITY OF LIFE’  Meanwhile, the drug has legal approval for medical use in more than three dozen states, the National Conference of State Legislatures said.  Quest Diagnostics found that the percentage of people in the general U.S. workforce that tested positive for marijuana came in at 4.3% in 2022. That marked an increase from the prior year, when it reported 3.9%.  The analysis also looked at how positive worker marijuana tests differed in states based on the legality status of the substance.  ""In the general U.S. workforce, states that have legalized recreational and medical marijuana use exhibit higher positivity rates that the national average,"" Quest Diagnostics Senior Director of Science for Employer Solutions Dr. Suhash Harwani said in the press release. ""States that have not legalized marijuana appear to have positivity rates below the national averages.""  Where people are legally allowed to use it recreationally, the percentage was 5.7%, Quest Diagnostics said. About 3.9% of the general U.S. workforce tested positive for marijuana in states permitting medical usage. In states barring both, the rate was 3.1%.  All three categories saw increases year over year, according to the analysis.  Quest Diagnostics credited higher shares testing positive for marijuana and amphetamines with boosting the overall drug positivity rate for general U.S. workers in urine tests. For amphetamines, it went from 1.3% in 2021 to 1.5% in 2022.  AMERICANS SPENT MORE ON LEGAL CANNABIS IN 2022 THAN CHOCOLATE, BEER: REPORT  The rate for drugs overall, at 5.7%, was up slightly from 2021, according to the analysis.  ""Year-over-year and five-year data point to continuously higher workforce drug positivity overall, by industry, and across multiple drug categories,"" Harwani also said. ""As employers express concerns for employee health, wellness and safety, they may want to consider these data as a warning sign, particularly as a growing body of science demonstrates the risks of marijuana to mental and physical health.""  Among more than 9 million urine drug tests of the general workforce and ""federally mandated, safety-sensitive"" workforce, 4.6% had positive results, Quest Diagnostics found. That percentage was the same year over year, it noted.  The practice of employers subjecting their staffers to drug testing has become more and more debated over the years.  NEW YORK PREPARED TO ISSUE 300 LEGAL POT DISPENSARY LICENSES  Among all Americans, roughly 18% reported in 2019 at least one instance of them using marijuana, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The percentage of Americans that said ""yes"" when asked about whether marijuana should become legal has been flat for three years, with 68% expressing that position in 2022, 2021 and 2020, according to a Gallup poll from November.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvcG9zaXRpdmUtbWFyaWp1YW5hLXRlc3RzLWZvbGxvd2luZy13b3JrcGxhY2UtYWNjaWRlbnRzLWhpZ2hlc3QtMjUteWVhcnPSAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL3Bvc2l0aXZlLW1hcmlqdWFuYS10ZXN0cy1mb2xsb3dpbmctd29ya3BsYWNlLWFjY2lkZW50cy1oaWdoZXN0LTI1LXllYXJzLmFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"accident","2023-05-23","19:00:00","{""Kisumu"", ""Nyanza"", ""Kenya""}","2023-05-22T21:02:56","Accidents can happen anytime, anywhere, resulting in injury, disability and, in a worst-case scenario, death.  That could spell financial catastrophe for the victim and their dependants if the breadwinner dies or is incapacitated.  Personal accident insurance is the best way to cushion individuals and families from the economic vagaries of accidental death and injury.  Its unique benefit is, it provides financial backup for the insured in case of temporary or permanent disability. It also caters to hospital bills up to a specific limit and the costs of artificial appliances such as crutches, hearing aid and prosthetics.  Many people are still not covered yet anybody who is likely to be financially impacted by being out of work due to accident-related injuries must possess this policy.  Fortunately, with as little as Sh228, for instance, a student can now purchase an annual personal accident cover, one of the most affordable. And being in the Digital Age, one only requires a smartphone or other internet-enabled computer device to sign up and get a cover in a few minutes, from anywhere.  So, why are people, especially the tech-savvy youth, uninsured? In the challenging economic environment, insurance may be perceived as an expensive luxury. But with the high number of road fatalities and injuries, personal accident insurance is critical. Statistics show 3,000 Kenyans, or one in 15,000, are likely to perish in a road crash every year.  With the ever-present threat of physical injury, the benefits of being insured outweigh the cost, especially considering the likely loss of income due to hospitalisation for prolonged periods. Besides, innovative technologies allow for the personalisation of underwriting products.  Data analytics, for instance, gives insurers a deeper view into the behaviours of their clients, helping them to customise solutions to their financial and insurance needs.  Financial technology firms specialising in providing insurance solutions, insurtech, has lent impetus to the increased adoption of digital channels in underwriting. Insurer and insured enjoy numerous benefits—including improved operational efficiency, faster claims processing, reduced costs and enhanced client experience. Underwriters should deploy insurtech platforms to attract young people, driving generational brand loyalty for insurers. Kenyan youth are a vastly under-served market with unique attitudes to insurance.  A survey in Kenya three years ago revealed that 89 per cent of the youth would opt for health insurance with 56 per cent for motor insurance and 48 per cent education insurance. It was explained that young people highly value their well-being.  Sensitising the youth on personal accident insurance can drive uptake among this highly dynamic group. Mobile-enabled insurtech apps are a plausible way of delivering insurance coverage to underserved markets like the youth. Insurers and intermediaries should focus on selling the financial benefits of personal accident insurance while simplifying products using innovative digital solutions.

It started almost by accident, but for 10 years has made people take me more seriously.  ""Talking through a man's voice helped me be able to ask for things I never would've asked for as myself,"" says Jamira Burley. Source: Jamira Burley  Jamira Burley, 34, works in the tech industry and has a fake personal assistant named Matt.  She says people treat you differently when they think you have an assistant — especially a male assistant.  As a woman of color who works in tech, Burley has felt more confident when she pretends to be Matt over email.  This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jamira Burley, a 34-year-old who works in the tech industry. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.  Scroll to continue with content Ad ADVERTISEMENT  I have a secret to tell you.  For the last 10 years, I've had a fake assistant. His name is Matt, and he answers emails for me. He negotiates rates, schedules meetings, and rejects offers that aren't up to par.  He also doesn't exist.  I created my fake personal assistant, Matt, a decade ago  It happened almost by accident. I had made a separate email account for people to contact me with opportunities, and I got an email where the person seemed to assume that a third person, like an assistant, was manning the contact email address.  And I just rolled with it.  My name is not a blank slate, like Matt's is  You read it and you can tell it's not American. You can also guess that I'm a woman.  As a woman of color who works in tech, I'm often the only person like me in the room. Having ""Matt"" on my side — a person who could be a white man — made me feel more confident. Talking through a man's voice helped me be able to ask for things I never would've asked for as myself.  People took me more seriously as a professional because I had an assistant  I immediately noticed that Matt garnered a level of respect that I, as Jamira, didn't. People would offer me more money when Matt was involved, and they treated me as more of a force to be reckoned with.  And when an opportunity didn't work out, it was easier to have Matt say no to something than to do it myself.  Creating Matt felt like cracking a code, but it didn't always feel good  I had figured out how to make people take me more professionally, but it was by using a fictitious white man as a go-between.  I try to remind myself that to change the rules of the game, you have to get yourself into the room first. Matt helped me get into more rooms.  Luckily, someone only asked to speak to Matt on the phone once. I asked one of my brothers to get on the phone and pretend to be Matt, which he did. I think people don't usually ask to actually speak to him because I have a deck of all my offerings that Matt would send out so all their questions are already answered.  My fake Matt is actually based on a real Matt  The real Matt is a close friend who doesn't know that he's the inspiration for my fake assistant. I met Matt in high school, and I was so impressed by his ability to believe he's deserving of opportunities that come to him.  He never seemed surprised when things worked out. As a white man, he moved through the world with a confidence that it seemed like he was almost born into.  I wanted to emulate it, so I did. He doesn't know that I've been using him as inspiration for my fake assistant's persona for more than a decade, and he won't know until he reads this. But I think he'll think it's funny.  Story continues  I posted a TikTok about my fake assistant  It's been viewed more than 550,000 times and liked more than 81,000 times.  ""People treat you entirely different when they think you have an assistant, and also when that assistant is male,"" I said in the video. By posting it, I realized that many more women than I thought do the same thing I've done.  And it's not just women or women of color who do this — it's disabled people or people who are a part of any minority group.  I've grown a lot in my decade with Matt  This is what I've learned: We all have to move through the world with the certainty and confidence of a white man. We are just deserving.  And until we can ask for what we need ourselves, have Matt ask for you.

The lawsuit aims to seek justice and accountability for the tragic car crash that claimed the life of Deputy Daniel Kin. Filed in Franklin County, the lawsuit holds Short responsible for the alleged negligence that led to the untimely death of Daniel Kin and the subsequent damages suffered by his family. The legal representation for the lawsuit is being provided by Jedidiah Bressman at Bressman Law.  “Police officers, just like the rest of us, deserve to be protected,” Bressman said in a press release. “Defendant Short has failed to take accountability for his actions.”  According to the lawsuit, on or about December 15, 2022, Deputy Daniel Kin was carrying out his duties as a deputy for the Wyandot County Sheriff’s office, transporting an inmate in a sheriff’s vehicle on Route 104 in Pickaway County, Ohio. Tragically, the vehicle operated by Daniel Kin was struck by defendant Steven Short’s motor vehicle, resulting in severe injuries and subsequent pain for Daniel Kin. Despite the efforts of medical professionals, Daniel Kin passed away.  The lawsuit alleges that the negligence of Short directly and proximately caused the collision and subsequent death of Daniel Kin. The complaint highlights the intense pain endured by Daniel Kin during treatment and his transportation to the hospital, citing it as a direct result of Short’s alleged negligence.  Left behind in the wake of this devastating loss are Daniel Kin’s wife, Erin Kin, and their two children. The lawsuit emphasizes that the alleged negligence of Short has caused immeasurable emotional suffering and significant financial burdens for Daniel Kin’s surviving family.  Erin Kin is seeking damages exceeding $500,000, reflecting the injuries and losses suffered as a direct and proximate result of Short’s alleged negligence. Although the exact financial extent of the damages cannot be specified at this time, the lawsuit underscores the significant impact it has had on the family’s livelihood.  Erin Kin and her legal team are determined to pursue justice and accountability in this matter. They hope that this lawsuit will not only provide closure for their family but also serve as a reminder of the importance of responsible driving, the release states.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vZ28udGlmZmlub2hpby5uZXQvMjAyMy8wNS9sYXdzdWl0LWFpbXMtdG8taG9sZC1kcml2ZXItYWNjb3VudGFibGUtZm9yLWNhci1hY2NpZGVudC10aGF0LWNsYWltZWQtZGVwdXR5cy1saWZlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The incident occurred with 48 minutes remaining in the two-hour session. In a pack of traffic, Wilson appeared to slow through the apex of turn one, and Legge struck him from behind, pitching both cars towards the SAFER barrier. Wilson’s #24 Cusick Motorsports car spun 360 degrees and hit the barrier head-on, while Legge’s #44 Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing car hit the wall right-side first and momentarily lifted into the air.  Wilson was extracted out of his car by the IndyCar safety team and loaded onto a stretcher with a neck brace fitted. Wilson gave a thumbs up to the crowd before he was transported directly to Indiana University Methodist Hospital, bypassing the Indianapolis Motor Speedway’s care centre.  Legge walked away seemingly unhurt from the incident, and was then evaluated and released from the care centre. IndyCar medical director Dr. Julia Vaizer said that Wilson was awake and alert following the accident.  “I can tell you that he [Stefan] is doing well,” said Dr. Vaizer. “He’s being transported to a local hospital for advanced imaging and further evaluation, but he is in good spirits.”  Speaking to NBC after the accident, Legge said she had little explanation for the accident.  “The cars in front were all checking up and I lifted as much as I could, downshifted, hit the brakes, but it wasn’t enough as they were checking up,” she said. “I got into the back of Stefan and we both ended up in the wall.”  The crash is further headache for RLL, who lost Graham Rahal’s #15 car from Sunday’s race after he was bumped out of qualifying by Jack Harvey.  “I know that its another blow to the team,” said Legge. “After yesterday, those guys don’t deserve it. It’s not right.”  This was the first significant crash throughout the entire Indianapolis 500 race meeting. Both days of qualifying and the preceding three days of practice were run without any crashes.  Wilson, 33, qualified for his fifth Indianapolis 500 on Saturday, and is due to start 25th in this Sunday’s race. His best finish in four previous attempts is 15th in 2018, a race in which he led three laps while bidding to win the race on a fuel strategy gamble.  The youngest of two racing brothers from Sheffield, Stefan has been taking part in the Indianapolis 500 in tribute to his older brother Justin, a multi-time IndyCar Series race winner and Formula 1 driver who died due to injuries sustain a crash during the 2015 IndyCar Pocono 500.

On Monday, family and friends buried 16-year-old Landon Grigg of Hopkins County after a side-by-side accident.  An accident also happened Sunday in Webster County, where a motocross rider was injured at the Echo Valley complex.  With the warm weather approaching, outdoor activities become more popular. Safety should always be considered when it comes to outdoor activities.  Since school is out for the summer, kids have more free time to ride ATVs, RTVs, dirt bikes, and UTVs recreationally.  Indiana has a helmet law where anyone under the age of 18 has to wear a helmet while on or in any off-road vehicle or they could receive a $500 fine.  Indiana Conversation Officer Ryan McIntyre shared tips to stay safe while riding.  “Watch your speed, wear a helmet, wear as much ATV safety gear as you can, and just be safe,” says McIntyre.

"accident","2005-09-13","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T16:42:11","On September 13, 2005, a disease began to spread in the massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) World of Warcraft.  An update to the game had introduced a new area for higher-level players, known as Zul'Gurub. In the area, there was a boss called ""Hakkar the Soul Flayer"" (warning: this article may contain words used primarily by dorks), a massive winged serpent that had a power that hadn't been introduced to the world yet: ""Corrupted Blood"".  Advertisement Advertisement  The idea was that Hakkar would infect players with the debuff, dealing 875-1,125 points of damage plus 200 damage per second to the target and all nearby enemies for 10 seconds. The unique part of this disease was that it would spread to other players in the vicinity of the infected player, all of whom would then lose health.  It was supposed to be annoying to players during this one battle, but ultimately stay in this specific area while you fought the boss. However, the creators hadn't quite thought things through.  Hakkar was able to transmit the virus to players' pets. Unfortunately, this meant that when you dismissed your pet when they were infected, unknown to patient zero, they remained infected until they were summoned again somewhere outside of the boss area.  Patient zero summoned their pet in a city elsewhere in World of Warcraft, and the plague spread like... well, a plague. Adding to the problem was that non-playable characters (NPCs) that give out quests to the players could contract the disease and spread it to others, without taking damage or dying, essentially acting like asymptomatic spreaders.  Advertisement Advertisement  The resulting pandemic became what the players (and epidemiologists) now refer to as the Hakkar Blood Plague or the Corrupted Blood incident.  What's cool about the incident, especially for epidemiologists, is how well it modeled actual viruses and outbreaks in the real world, as has been pointed out in a thread on Twitter, as well as in a 2007 paper published in The Lancet.  ⓘ IFLScience is not responsible for content shared from external sites.  Advertisement Advertisement  It killed low-level players quickly, simulating the vulnerable such as the elderly or the immunocompromised. You have players who can teleport from city to city, simulating traveling by air in the real world. Stronger players could withstand the disease, barely being weakened by it, simulating those who get mildly ill from a disease.  ""Also aiding in the continuation of the epidemic, a cycle involving the resurrection of weaker characters by those with healing abilities, saw the susceptible population continually replenished (only to be reinfected and die again),"" the team added in their paper.  Then you have the added bonus that people would behave in ways similar to how they would act in the real world.  In an attempt to control the outbreak, the game's makers tried to instigate a quarantine, asking the infected to isolate themselves from uninfected areas. As with real life, many players were compliant but others resisted the quarantine. Due to the highly contagious nature of the disease, the outbreak soon spread through the cities.  Advertisement Advertisement  As well as people who would spread the disease around cities (on purpose or by accident), you also had many people who would attempt to heal the sick and the dying, acting like first responders and medics in the real world. According to the Lancet paper, unfortunately, this may have extended the Corrupted Blood outbreak ""by keeping infected individuals alive long enough for them to continue spreading the disease, and by becoming infected themselves and being highly contagious when they rushed to another area"" though overall they may have reduced mortality rates.  Ultimately, attempting to deal with the outbreak through in-world measures failed due to players not taking the risks seriously, and heading to areas where there were infections, spreading it themselves to others. It had to be fixed by rolling out another update.  Though slightly silly and ultimately of no consequence, it was a good model to see if an extremely highly-contagious disease could be contained through public health actions. Many of the players' commitment to the game was so strong that it gave researchers a pretty good model for how people would act in a real outbreak.  ""All together, these seemingly innocuous aspects of the game world, each directly mirroring an aspect of real-world epidemiology, allowed what should have been a very minor point of interest in a small area of the game, catering to a very specific subset of the players, to become the first online instance of uncontrolled plague to affect millions of Americans, Asians, and Europeans at home,"" authors of the 2005 study wrote in their paper.  Advertisement Advertisement  It gave some good lessons for how people might deal with an outbreak in the real world, and the authors made suggestions for how further games could be used to model more realistic diseases that might cause a pandemic.  Then, unfortunately, we all learned the hard way.  The study was published in The Lancet.

"accident","2006-02-10","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T10:20:39","Lexie Bader was 15 years old when she suffered a life-changing snowboarding accident. She was traveling approximately 20 mph and hit a tree. She broke her ankle, but it never quite healed correctly. Over the next nine years, she would have around 30 surgeries performed on it.  Lexie was diagnosed with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) as if the previous nine years weren’t hard enough. CRPS is a form of chronic pain that usually affects an arm or a leg. It typically develops after an injury, surgery, stroke, or heart attack. The pain is out of proportion to the severity of the initial injury and caused by an injury to or difference in the peripheral and central nervous systems. For Lexie, there was no cure.  CRPS is considered the most painful chronic pain syndrome known. It is nicknamed the “suicide disease” because of the prevalence of people committing suicide due to the pain. For this reason, Lexie decided she wanted to amputate her leg rather than live with the pain.  Unfortunately for Lexie, the nerve disease spread to the other side of her body after her surgery and began to affect her other leg. CRPS occasionally spreads from its source to elsewhere in the body, such as the opposite limb.  She was devastated, as the pain was back, so she also decided to amputate her other leg.  Now she is equipped with two prosthetic legs, with various feet and blades that screw into the bottom of the sockets.

He was 76-years-old.  Brandt was hospitalized over the weekend after being involved in an automobile accident in Urbana, Illinois and later died due to the result of suffering several serious injuries. Of course, for those familiar with Brandt and the memes surrounding him, then they know that he left behind quite the legacy.  The aforementioned “Honest Work” meme first began circulating in 2012. “It ain’t much,” the meme often reads, “but it’s honest work.” The image, and its accompanying statement, originated at a Natural Resources Conservation Service event on Brandt’s own farm in Carroll, Ohio.  Naturally, David Brandt was rather fond of the meme and the impact it had on his work. In fact, he continued to use use the meme as a symbol for the work he and his family performed with their farm. The farm, which has consistently belonged to his family, is said to consist of 736 acres of no-till row crops and cover crops. As of this writing, the farm involves three different generations of his family.  Furthermore, Brandt’s work extended far past memes and his own farm. He often traveled the country to perform in different seminars and reports where he discussed agriculture and his family’s business. As such, the meme is just the tip of the iceberg for what he’s accomplished over his lifetime. It certainly goes to show what honest work can do.  His company Walnut Creek Seeds was owned and operated by Brandt alongside his son, daughter-in-law, and grandson. As such, his legacy will continue to live on and it’s quite impressive to see what kind of career he’s led. Perhaps saying it “ain’t much” is an understatement.  David Brandt’s obituary can be read below:  Ohio agriculture has never before known a global cultural phenomenon quite like David Brandt, of Fairfield County, who passed away at the age of 76 from complications resulting from an automobile accident.  He was known around the world as the face of a meme associated with honest work. In agricultural circles, Brandt will be remembered as a global leader in no-till, cover crops, soil health, nutrient dense crops, and direct marketing. Agriculturalists from around the world visited his Fairfield County farm each year to see his soils first-hand and learn from his many years of experience. He also traveled the world speaking about his farm. Brandt was a Vietnam veteran who returned home to farm in the late 1960s, but soon after his return, Brandt’s father died in a farming accident. He and his wife, Kendra (who passed away in 2020), were forced to sell the farm and start over with very little equipment. No-till was a way to reduce costs. Since then, Brandt’s use of no-till and cover crops has increased soil organic matter and decreased input costs dramatically. He has served as a conservation mentor to many. He farmed and operated Walnut Creek Seeds, with his son, daughter-in-law and grandson.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjcmVlbmdlZWsubmV0LzIwMjMvMDUvMjIvZGF2aWQtYnJhbmR0LWhvbmVzdC13b3JrLW1lbWUtZGVhZC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Daegen Vaughn, 19, and Mason Sterner, 22, were riding on a jet ski on Weiss Lake near Cedar Bluff on May 20, the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency told McClatchy News in an email.  Around 10:30 p.m., the 2021 Yamaha WaveRunner, driven by Vaughn, ran aground, authorities said, crashing into a tree on land.  Vaughn was declared dead at the scene and Sterner was taken to a Georgia hospital with injuries, authorities said.  Vaughn, a graduate of Trion High School in Georgia, was remembered as a high school wrestling “star” and football player, according to SNBC13.com.  “Lost a member of the 2021 football and wrestling teams,” neighboring high school Chattooga Indian Football said in a Facebook post. “Daegan was such a fine young man. He was a team player who did whatever was asked of him and he always supported his teammates!!! Proud to have had the opportunity to coach Dago.”  Vaughn won more than 100 matches in high school, making him a “standout” in Georgia wrestling, AllOnGeorgia reported, and his team placed second at the state championship in 2019.  Rhonda Williams, an English teacher at Trion High School, said Vaughn helped her have “one of my all time favorite school years,” according to a Facebook post.  “I am so saddened by this loss but so happy for the memories I have of this precious young man, D aegan Vaughn,” she wrote.  Vaughn’s mother, Taylen Vaughn, shared a photo of her son on Facebook that was taken just hours before the accident.  “If I could go back I would hold you tight and never would (have) let you go,” she wrote. “I love you so much baby boy. My life will never be the same without you in it.”  The Alabama Law Enforcement Agency told McClatchy News it is still investigating the crash.

Georgia’s Department of Transportation Crash Data Portal estimates that the number of car accidents in Augusta between 2019 and 2020 was 18,029.  If you have sustained injuries in a car accident and suffered losses, feel free to consult an Augusta car accident lawyer for advice on whether or not you are entitled to a claim and what steps you should take.  Should you pursue a personal injury claim? Here are critical determinant factors to always remember and how to proceed with the claim.  Time Limit for Making a Claim  When you make your insurance claim or file, a lawsuit plays a significant part in determining the validity of your claim. Many car accidents involve claiming an insurance company, which may be to the defendant’s insurer or your own.  In many states, insurance companies require accident victims to file claims within a “reasonable” time. Some insurers have a strict time frame within which you must file a claim. To avoid invalidating your claim, act quickly and don’t wait too long to file your claim with the insurance company.  On the other hand, it is pertinent that you know the personal injury statutory limitations in your jurisdiction if you are filing a car accident lawsuit. Filing outside of the statute of limitations will have dire consequences, as the court will consider your claim time-barred. In many states, the statute of limitations for personal injury claims is 1-2 years.  Elements of Negligence  For a favorable outcome in your claim, you must satisfy all the elements of negligence. You must demonstrate that the defendant owed you a duty of care and breached the duty of care. Also, you must prove that the defendant’s negligence led to your injuries. Without satisfying all these elements, you will likely not receive compensation.  It’s common for the at-fault party in a car accident to raise the defense of contributory or comparative negligence. If the defendant shows that you didn’t act reasonably and suffered injuries, they may hold you partially liable.  You would not receive any damages if the accident happened in a state that upholds contributory negligence laws. However, if the accident occurred in a state that supports comparative negligence laws, how much you receive as compensation will depend on your share of liability.  Sufficient Evidence  The strength of your personal injury claim hinges mainly on the evidence you can present to the court to prove negligence. A lack of sufficient evidence is just cause for the court to dismiss your claim.  To improve your chances of getting compensation, ensure you provide the relevant documentation to support your claim.  The first of these documents is the car accident police report which the insurance company will find helpful when reviewing your claim and conducting their independent investigations.  Secondly, get witness statements. The testimony of people who witnessed the accident will only strengthen your claim.  Lastly, gather all the medical reports to confirm your injuries, which will also contain information on your history. Additionally, keep the receipts for medical tests, medication, and any other charges related to the treatment of your injuries.  The insurance adjuster may try to dispute your injuries, but this may be a big challenge when you have supporting medical reports. For example, if the insurance adjuster claims you have a pre-existing condition, the reports will show your medical history and most recent health status. Depending on the severity of your injuries, your lawyer may use an expert witness to corroborate the details in your medical reports.  Wrapping Up  Having learned that you are entitled to an injury claim and what to expect, you want to have the right people in your corner. So, do some research and hire professionals to help you get the claim.

The accident happened just after 2:30 p.m. on Monday in the construction zone about a mile west of the Girard Exit (Exit 9). The crash involved a semi, a flatbed pulling a trailer, a van and a car in the eastbound lanes.  According to Erie County Coroner Lyell Cook, the crash may have happened as traffic slowed due to another accident up the road.  The 12-year-old victim was pronounced dead at the scene. Four other people were taken to the hospital including the child’s mother who was flown by helicopter.  All five were in the van which flipped onto its side.

PennDOT is now reporting I-90 eastbound is closed from Exit 3 (Route 6N – West Springfield/Cherry Hill) to Exit 9 (Route 18 – Girard/Platea). The area was originally closed from Exit 6 to Exit 9 on I-90 and was expanded as of 4:15 p.m.  For those who haven’t been that far west on I-90 in a while, roadwork is being done currently, with the westbound lane’s pavement totally stripped, limiting motorists to one lane both east and westbound with large cement dividers in between.  It is within this change in traffic patterns that the accident occurred. One car is heavily damaged and flipped entirely on its side.  I-90 has been brought to a near standstill at this time.

"accident","2023-04-14","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T13:09:00","The pilot reported that during the preflight inspection, he filled the Piper J-4A’s forward (main) fuel tank to about 1 inch below the top and noted that the auxiliary fuel tank contained 4 gallons of fuel. The pilot used a stick to “dip” the two fuel tanks and validate the amount of fuel in them.  The pilot planned on departing from North Omaha Airport (3NO) in Nebraska for flight operations in the airport’s traffic pattern.  Before the takeoff, the fuel selector was positioned for the forward fuel tank. During the takeoff, the airplane traveled about three-quarters of the way down the runway and climbed to about 300 feet above ground level. The engine sputtered once and stopped producing power. The pilot switched the fuel selector to the auxiliary fuel tank and tried to restart the engine unsuccessfully.  He maneuvered the airplane for a forced landing, but the airplane hit the ground and came to rest next to a tree in a field.  The pilot reported that fuel was pouring into the cockpit after the airplane came to rest, and he quickly got out of the airplane.  The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings and the fuselage, while the pilot sustained minor injuries.  A post-accident examination of the airframe and engine revealed that the fuel tank cap found installed on the filler neck of the forward fuel tank did not appear to be the correct part for the airplane. It had a part number of 2501621 etched on it with no manufacturer name displayed.  The fuel tank cap appeared to be manufactured with a single vent hole. The fuel tank cap was equipped with two worn gaskets stacked under the cap. The lower gasket had multiple visible cracks present on both sides of it. The upper gasket was wrinkled and was displaced toward the vent hole, which blocked the venting capability of the fuel tank. Based on the available evidence, it could not be determined when the vent hole became blocked. No fuel was observed in the forward fuel tank, which had sustained impact damage.  For the Piper J-4 Cub, the sole source of venting for the forward fuel tank is through a vented fuel tank cap. The approved part numbers for the forward fuel tank caps from the original equipment manufacturer (Piper) are A748 (the older style) or 00062-40 (the newer style).  The pilot reported that the forward fuel tank cap was on the airplane when he purchased it several years ago. The pilot and his brother purchased the airplane together in March 2011, and the pilot became the sole owner in October 2017. The pilot did not have any knowledge of the origin or the background of the forward fuel tank cap.  According to the airplane’s maintenance logbook, during the airplane’s most recent annual inspection, the airplane was inspected per Piper Inspection Sheets 230-3000. The accident occurred 39 days after the inspection, and 2.3 airplane flight hours had accumulated since the inspection.  The FAA Airplane Flying Handbook (FAA-H-8083-3B) discusses preflight procedures and states in part:  Checking the fuel tank vent is an important part of a preflight assessment. If outside air is unable to enter the tank as fuel is drawn into the engine, the eventual result is fuel starvation and engine failure. During the preflight assessment, the pilot should look for signs of vent damage and blockage. Some airplanes utilize vented fuel caps, fuel vent tubes, or recessed areas under the wings where vents are located. The pilot should use a flashlight to look at the fuel vent to ensure that it is free from damage and clear of obstructions. If there is a rush of air when the fuel tank cap is cracked, there could be a serious problem with the vent system.  Probable Cause: A total loss of engine power due to a blocked fuel tank cap vent hole, which resulted in fuel starvation. Contributing to the accident was the mechanic’s and the pilot’s inadequate inspections of the fuel tank cap.  NTSB Identification: 103179  To download the final report. Click here.

In a recent interview with the “Valuetainment: PBD” podcast, Mike Tyson made mention of what others have hinted at regarding the cause behind a reported “medical complication” for Jamie Foxx.  When host Patrick Bet-David asked Tyson if he was following “what’s going on with Jamie Foxx,” Tyson replied, “He’s not feeling well.”  Bet-David said, “Something’s going on with him?” and Mike Tyson replied, “Yeah, they said stroke; I have no idea what happened to him.”  Don’t Push Tyson Too Hard  It is unclear if Tyson quickly realized that he might have said too much, but Tyson clarified and attempted to move on from the subject.  The host pressed on and later in the show Tyson became agitated which you do not want to have happen when sitting next to a man once considered “the baddest man on the planet.”  “Hey listen, if we don’t know by now they don’t want us to. You know, man; come on, stop,” Tyson said to create a hard stop on the Jamie Foxx health questions.  For years, the entertainer has worked on producing a movie on his former friend, with the actor playing the titular character. The project has been in the works for more than a decade, and recently gained traction as a potential TV movie. Given his current health, it is unclear if Foxx will remain in the starring role for the project.  What Happens Now With The Tyson Movie?  “Well, it was a possibility,” Tyson continued. “I don’t know what’s going to happen now. But, you know, it’s a strong possibility. Because, you know, Jamie’s closer to my age, so in order to do him, they were going to do what they did with Benjamin Button. They were going to make him look younger.”  However, now the world wants some clarity on Foxx’s health. According to reports, he has been undergoing medical treatment at a physical rehabilitation facility in Chicago, where he has been receiving care for the past few weeks.  What Is Wrong With Jamie Foxx?  What Foxx is being treated for has not been announced to the public. However, the facility specializes in rehabilitation care for patients with physical impairments to the brain and spine.  FOXX Initially was hospitalized in Atlanta in mid-April after experiencing an undisclosed “medical complication,” per his daughter, Corinne Foxx. Since, the family has been tight-lipped regarding his condition.  Foxx’s daughter, with whom he has co-hosted the game show “Beat Shazam,” has shared an “update from the family” on her Instagram story that her father has “been out of the hospital for weeks, recuperating.”  Multiple celebrities have expressed on social media that they’re praying for the actor’s recovery, with no indication of his current condition or confirmation of what he has gone through. The lack of information has led to rumors, and Foxx’s daughter wasn’t having it.  “Sad to see how the media runs wild,” Corinne Foxx wrote at the time. “My dad has been out of the hospital for weeks, recuperating. In fact, he was playing pickleball yesterday!

Keystone / Jose Sotomayor  read aloud pause  X  A fire that led to the death of 27 miners at a Peruvian mine has prompted questions about the rigor behind a Swiss government-backed effort to improve safety and working conditions in the gold supply chain.  This content was published on May 21, 2023  NZZamSonntag/jdp  Switzerland is one of the most important hubs for gold trading and refining. It’s estimated that around two-thirds of the world’s gold is refined in the country. Much of this gold is mined by artisanal and small-scale miners in Latin America and Africa.  The Swiss government has been working with refiners and various organisations to improve the safety and working conditions of artisanal miners under the banner of the Better Gold Initiative, a public-private partnership supported by the Swiss government.  On May 6, a fire broke out at La Esperanza mine in the Yanaquihia district in Peru, killing 27 gold miners who were unable to escape. The fire was the country's deadliest mining accident since 2000.  The mine had been part of the Swiss Better Gold Initiative, reveals the German-language paper NZZamSonntag. In June 2020, the initiative announced that a partnership with the Yanaquihua mining company and the Swiss refiner Metalor led to the creation of a fully traceable and responsible international supply chain from the Arequipa region in Peru to the Swiss market.  The initiative is now trying to make sense of the tragedy. “The accident is a shock for us,” Thomas Hentschel, Director of the Swiss Better Gold Initiative, told NZZamSonntag. He’s visited the mine before and said, “it's one of the really good mines we have in Peru”.  Christoph Wiedmer, co-director of the NGO Society for Threatened Peoples, says that the accident should prompt reflection on whether there’s enough rigor in the responsible mining standards and verification systems.  “Although the causes have not yet been conclusively clarified, from our point of view the question arises as to whether responsibility has been sufficiently taken adopted across the entire supply chain,” said Wiedmer in a press release. “There are many indications that the previous due diligence measures were insufficient.”  The Better Gold Initiative for Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining was launched in 2013 by the Swiss Better Gold Association with the aim to expand production of responsibly sourced artisanal and small-scale mined gold with a focus on Peru, Colombia and Bolivia. A key aspect is formalisaing miners and securing accreditation as responsible producers. Companies such as refiners and jewelers commit to buy Swiss Better Gold at a premium price. The initiative received CHF18 million in federal funding until 2025.

"accident","2023-04-26","Not Discerned","{""Changsha"", ""Hunan"", ""China""}","2023-05-22T01:29:07","By Jiang Chenglong | China Daily | Updated: 2023-05-22 09:23  Property owner, public officials are at fault in Hunan accident that killed 54  The collapse of a self-constructed building in Hunan province that killed 54 people last year was an ""especially serious production safety liability accident"" caused by the property owner's illegal construction and operation, as well as local governments' irresponsibility and buck-passing, which led to major long-term safety hazards, an investigation said on Sunday.  The results of the investigation into the case were released on Sunday afternoon by an investigation team launched by the State Council, China's Cabinet. Meanwhile, 66 public officials, including four provincial-level officials, were held accountable to varying degrees for the accident.  According to a news release from the investigation team, the accident that occurred in April last year in the Wangcheng district of Hunan's Changsha city left 54 people dead and nine injured, and caused a direct economic loss of 90.78 million yuan ($13.9 million).  The original five-story building, built illegally by the property owner, was built poorly to begin with, with an unreasonable structure, weak stability and low load-bearing capacity, the investigation found. After the illegal construction of three additional floors, the load increased even more dramatically, exceeding the structure's maximum load capacity and ultimately leading to the total collapse of the building, according to the statement.  The investigation concluded that the governments of Hunan province, Changsha city and Wangcheng district, and relevant departments had various problems, including the slow and perfunctory implementation of crackdowns on illegal construction.  In July 2020, a yearlong inspection of illegal construction was launched across the nation, while the governments of Changsha city and Wangcheng district began carrying out inspections half a year later and one year later, respectively — quite near the deadline of the nationwide campaign, the leader of the investigation team said.  ""There was no time[for them] to carry out the inspections, and they reported seriously false data,"" the statement said.  The investigation found that a substantial number of illegally constructed houses were not included in the management and supervision of the housing authorities of Changsha and Wangcheng.  Based on the results, the investigation team concluded that officials from the Hunan, Changsha and Wangcheng governments were responsible for the accident.  The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China and the National Supervisory Commission imposed penalties on four senior officials, namely Hu Henghua, Chen Wenhao, Wu Guiying and Hu Zhongxiong. From 2013 to 2021, they served in key Party and government positions, such as Changsha's mayor and Party chief, in relation to leading the urban construction and inspection work. They were given intra-Party warnings and demerits.  Another 62 public local officials suspected of violating laws and regulations around the accident were held accountable by the Hunan provincial discipline inspection authorities.  Four public officials, including Zhou Zhengmao, former deputy head of the Wangcheng government, had their cases transferred to judicial organs for serious violations of discipline and law and suspected duty crimes.  The other 58 public officials received various punishments. Changsha Mayor Zheng Jianxin, for example, was removed from his position. In addition, 14 people, including Wu Zhiyong, the owner of the building, were investigated by the police and prosecuted by procuratorial organs on accusations of committing major liability accidents, providing false certification documents and picking quarrels and provoking trouble.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZ2xvYmFsLmNoaW5hZGFpbHkuY29tLmNuL2EvMjAyMzA1LzIyL1dTNjQ2YWM0MTZhMzEwYjYwNTRmYWQ0NGJkLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

He was known around the world as the face of a meme associated with honest work. In agricultural circles, Brandt will be remembered as a global leader in no-till, cover crops, soil health, nutrient dense crops, and direct marketing. Agriculturalists from around the world visited his Fairfield County farm each year to see his soils first-hand and learn from his many years of experience. He also traveled the world speaking about his farm. Brandt was a Vietnam veteran who returned home to farm in the late 1960s, but soon after his return, Brandt’s father died in a farming accident. He and his wife, Kendra (who passed away in 2020), were forced to sell the farm and start over with very little equipment. No-till was a way to reduce costs. Since then, Brandt’s use of no-till and cover crops has increased soil organic matter and decreased input costs dramatically. He has served as a conservation mentor to many. He farmed and operated Walnut Creek Seeds, with his son, daughter-in-law and grandson.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vb2NqLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1L2JyYW5kdC1wYXNzZWQtYXdheS1sZWF2aW5nLWEtbGVnYWN5LW9mLWNvbnNlcnZhdGlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"accident","1991-07-07","Not Discerned","{""SanDiego"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T04:14:00","This love story couldn’t happen today.  Back in 1991 – before dating apps existed, when Portland (as well as the world) was a very different place – a Northeast Portland woman signed up for a Rose Festival program in which locals offered to “host” sailors when the U.S. Navy ships arrived for the annual event.  The woman’s name reminded one sailor of a girl he knew back home in Michigan.  That’s the only reason they met.  She took him out for pizza. They chatted. It was all very casual and innocent.  Things didn’t get serious until they found the dead body.  ***  Carolyn Becker, born and raised in Portland.  Carolyn Becker was born and raised in Portland and graduated from Reynolds High School. Throughout her childhood, she said, the Rose Festival was a very big deal.  “We always went to the parade,” she said. “When I was little, my friends and I had gone to the junior parade and the rides on the waterfront.”  In 1991, she was 28 and coming out of what she called a “bad relationship” when she saw a Rose Festival announcement about a quirky program, started in 1976, called Host-A-Sailor.  A Portland-area resident could volunteer to help a sailor enjoy the city during Fleet Week.  Host-A-Sailor was far tamer than it might sound to today’s Tinder-attuned ears. It usually involved a host taking a sailor to a restaurant, maybe with a side trip to a touristy spot like the Rose Garden or Powell’s City of Books. And that would be it. Sailor and host would say a cheery goodbye and part ways.  Becker figured the program would prompt her to get out of the house and visit downtown, so she called the festival’s office and supplied her information, which included her name and work phone number. She offered to take a sailor out to dinner.  No vetting.  No background checks.  Not even a photo.  Rose Festival officials simply stuck Becker’s slip of paper with her contact info and offer of a meal, along with hundreds of other similar slips of paper, on a board for the sailors to peruse when they walked off the gangplank.  Shortly after Bob Marnon’s ship docked on the Willamette River in the heart of the city, commanders briefed the crew about Rose Festival activities, and mentioned the Host-A-Sailor program.  Marnon checked it out, scanning the names on the large notice board set up in Waterfront Park specifically for this purpose. He stopped when he saw the name Becker, the same last name as a girl he knew in his hometown back in Michigan.  He decided it was fate. He took the slip of paper off the board, walked to a payphone, dropped in some change and called the number on the paper.  A woman answered.  It was not Carolyn Becker. Marnon discovered he was calling the local Social Security Administration office, where Becker worked.  Marnon left a message, but he knew that was pointless. He was at a payphone that did not accept incoming calls. Normal life back before cellphones.  He waited by the phone for a few minutes, weighing his options.  He fished out more change.  Another call.  No answer.  He almost tossed the slip of paper into the garbage and moved on. But something stopped him.  One more time, he decided.  Worst case he was out less than a dollar.  He put more change into the phone, punched in the number.  “I was near my phone,” said Becker. “I heard it ring. He introduced himself. I told him I’d take him out for pizza that night.”  It was a short, straightforward conversation, almost businesslike.  Becker met Marnon at the ship a couple hours later and drove him across the river to a favorite pizza place in Southeast Portland.  “He wanted to pay for the pizza,” she said. “I wouldn’t let him. One of the rules was that volunteers host the sailor. We sat and we talked.”  This was not a blind date.  Just a couple strangers talking.  “I wasn’t looking for anything,” said Becker. “Neither was he.”  But love has a funny way of creeping up on people.  ***  Bob Marnon while he was stationed in San Diego.  It wasn’t a blind date, but they liked each other, had enjoyed spending time together.  When Becker drove Marnon back to his ship, they found themselves agreeing to meet the next night when he got off duty.  They walked around downtown Portland that following evening, talking about their families and life. When the night ended, Marnon asked for Becker’s home address and telephone number. She gave them to him, but she didn’t think anything of it.  “His ship was leaving, and I figured I’d never hear from him again,” she said.  A few days later, Marnon called her from Vancouver, Canada.  He can’t explain exactly why.  A look in her eye?  Her smile?  Her voice?  Why?  “I don’t know,” he said. “I guess I just kind of liked her.”  Marnon can be understated. Yes, he just kind of liked her.  Becker recognized his voice immediately when he called.  “I was surprised,” she said. “Delightfully so.”  Letters and more calls followed.  Marnon used vacation time to come to Portland to celebrate her birthday. They went on a hike to the Cape Lookout State Park near Tillamook.  Then something unusual – and distressing – happened.  “We found a dead body,” Becker said. “That’s when our relationship solidified.”  ***  Marnon recalled it was about dusk. He and Becker were walking on the beach when he saw a man lying on the sand, the waves washing over him.  “I thought someone was passed out,” he said. “I kicked off my shoes and went running because the tide was coming in and starting to wash him out.”  When he got to the body, he knew the man was dead. He pulled the body out of the water and waited for Becker, who’d gone to the ranger station to get help.  When she returned, authorities had been called and took over the matter. She took the moment to ask Marnon why he’d run into the surf. He told her that if that man was his brother, he’d want someone to try to help.  “I thought, Man, this is a good guy,” said Becker. “That’s when I fell in love.”  The next day the couple was in a Tillamook hardware store when they overheard customers talking about the body found by beachcombers. Authorities eventually determined the man drowned after falling off a fishing boat.  The traumatic experience on the beach brought them closer, made them realize something fundamental about each other.  “No one,” said Marnon, “has a dating story like ours.”  After the trip, they kept in touch.  Letters.  Calls.  A bittersweet memory kept coming back to Becker.  The month before she met Marnon, her grandfather died.  “My grandmother was so distraught,” Becker said. “I went to visit her, and she said she wanted to die. She wanted to hold hands with my grandfather one last time and be buried together.”  Her grandmother’s pain was so palpable; it was heartbreaking. But it also gave her hope.  “I knew,” she said, “that was the kind of love I wanted in my life.”  In November, six months after their first meeting, Becker used a week of vacation to visit Marnon in San Diego. They drove up to Los Angeles.  “We went to Disneyland,” she said. The theme park – and everything about the day – was magical.  “When we left Disneyland, we drove straight to Las Vegas and got married in one of those chapels,” she said. “When I flew back to Portland, my parents picked me up at the airport and I told them I was married.”  In January 1992, Becker – now Carolyn Marnon – left Portland and moved in with her husband in a San Diego apartment.  “We had our son in 1993,” she said. “Bob re-enlisted and we were transferred to Treasure Island near San Francisco.”  ***  Marnon, a machinist mate in the Navy, oversaw engines and turbines on the ship. He left the service after nearly a decade, and he and Carolyn moved to Westland, a Detroit suburb, where he uses his Navy skills as a supervisor in a power plant. His wife is a church administrator. Their son is 29. Their daughter, married, is 27.  The nature of love, said Carolyn Marnon, remains mysterious.  “Love,” she said, “comes to you when you’re not looking for it.”  The Host-A-Sailor program ended 20 years ago. Fleet Week continues, but it’s not what it used to be. It was dialed back after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and never recovered.

Parambir had been arrested on Saturday after being on the run for three days.  On Sunday, Parambir’s counsel also moved an application in court seeking permission for his client to appear in his annual exam scheduled to be held on May 26.  Police said they will now question Parambir to ascertain the details of a woman friend, who was allegedly with him in the red-coloured Beetle car at the time of the accident, as well as also to try to figure the names of all those who had helped him escape from the spot later.  On Sunday, the police told the court that the interrogation of Parambir was required in order to ascertain where he had been hiding for the last three days.  A police officer, on condition of anonymity, said that Parambir’s woman friend has been identified as a shooter and a notice has been served to her to join the investigations. He added that the duo used to practice together at the Chandigarh police shooting range in Sector 25.  Investigators stated that the Parambir was enroute to drop his woman friend from the Sector 25 shooting range to Mullanapur roundabout when the road accident took place at the Dhanas-Sarangpur road on May 17. He was arrested for culpable homicide not amounting to murder and rash driving.  Police have so far established that 19-year-old Parambir is a national level shooter, and a BA first year student in SD College, Sector 32. Parambir, police said, is a resident of Sector 21, Panchkula, and is the son of businessman, Kamaljeet Singh, who owns a mega mall in Zirakpur in Mohali.  Advertisement  A speeding Volkswagen Beetle car had ran over seven people, including a woman vendor selling husk corn, on the footpath at Dhanas-Sarangpur dividing road. The vendor, Rajvati Devi, was killed on the spot.  Later, two other injured — Mustafa Ali and Vimlesh Devi — had succumbed to their injuries during treatment in PGI. The condition of the other four injured — identified as Karamjeet Singh, 55, Bobby, 23, Dilip Soni, 22, and Neelam, 28 — is stated to be stable as they receive treatment in PGI. A case under charges of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, and rash driving has been registered at Sarangpur police station and Parambir arrested on Saturday  Investigators so far have claimed that it was Parambir who was behind the wheels of the car on Wednesday night.  SSP (UT) Kanwardeep Kaur said, “During the course of investigations, we examined the CCTV footage, and social media accounts of the accused, besides taking technical assistance and cultivating human intelligence to trace accused. At least 15 police teams were formed who conducted raids at multiple places during our search for the accused. He was finally arrested from near Dhanas on Saturday evening.”  Advertisement  A police officer said that the accused, Paramveer, was identified by at least two people, who were present at the spot at the time when the speeding Beetle car hit the seven people on May 17.  A team comprising DSP (central) Gurmukh Singh, SHO of Police Station Sarangpur, Inspector Rohit Kumar, and personnel of District Crime Cell (DCC) arrested Parambir from near Dhanas on Saturday after receiving a tip-off.  Also Read | 20-year-old national shooter arrested for mowing down three on footpath with his Beetle  A police officer said, “Our investigations so far has revealed that when the accident took place, Parambir was driving the car in ‘sports’ mode, which essentially means more pick-up and speed.  After running over the seven people, Parambir had allegedly called up two of his friends and managed to escape from the spot in their Toyota Innova Crysta car. We obtained CCTV camera footage from the spot showing Parambir fleeing in an SUV.  He had sustained minor injuries in the accident and had gone to a private hospital in Sector 34 to get first aid. He has so far claimed before us that his car had hit a motorcyclist by the side of a road, leading to the deployment of the airbags, which blocked his view and caused his Beetle car to plough into the seven people. We are not buying his claim.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvY2l0aWVzL2NoYW5kaWdhcmgvYmVldGxlLWFjY2lkZW50LWRheS1hZnRlci1hcnJlc3QtYWNjdXNlZC1tb3Zlcy1wbGVhLWluLWNvdXJ0LXRvLWFwcGVhci1pbi1leGFtLTg2MjE3OTIv0gGQAWh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9jaXRpZXMvY2hhbmRpZ2FyaC9iZWV0bGUtYWNjaWRlbnQtZGF5LWFmdGVyLWFycmVzdC1hY2N1c2VkLW1vdmVzLXBsZWEtaW4tY291cnQtdG8tYXBwZWFyLWluLWV4YW0tODYyMTc5Mi9saXRlLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Southerly winds are transporting pollutants into the state. Sunny skies, warm temperatures, and low humidity will allow these pollutants to react in the air to produce ground-level ozone. Ozone will be highest during the afternoon and early evening hours when sunshine is most abundant, and temperatures are highest. Air quality is expected to reach the Orange AQI category. This is considered unhealthy for sensitive groups. PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS... Sensitive groups, such as people with lung disease (including asthma), heart disease, children and older adults, and people who are active outdoors, should limit prolonged or heavy outdoor exertion. Reduce or eliminate activities that contribute to air pollution, such as outdoor burning, and use of residential wood burning devices.

"accident","2023-12-10","Not Discerned","{""Marshalltown"", ""Iowa"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T05:19:04","A 4-year-old boy was struck by a Marshalltown Police Department vehicle Saturday night. The vehicle was driven by Officer David Danielson.  The accident occurred near the intersection of Woodbury Street and North 12th Avenue. Danielson was conducting a routine patrol through the area at the time. The officer immediately summoned medical treatment for the child, who was transported to a medical facility. The Marshalltown Fire Department and the Unity Point Ambulance service responded.  The accident did not appear to result in serious injury. The boy, son of Laura Gonzalez-Saravia, was treated for a wound on his right foot and lower leg, and had various scratches and abrasions. He was treated and released, and will have additional medical follow-up later this week.  Gonzalez-Saravia said her son, Maximiliano Saravia, is doing better, but is complaining of pain. He woke up scared because he could not move his leg. His ankle is broken, but Maximiliano will see a specialist on Monday to determine a treatment plan, and how long recuperation will be.  Marshalltown Police Department Chief Mike Tupper said, upon reviewing the video from the police department vehicle, Danielson was trying to navigate around an ice cream truck, and the boy ran out in front.  “He [Danielson] had no chance to avoid him,” Tupper said. “I want to emphasize that I am not blaming anyone. Accidents happen.”  The chief said other children and adults were in the vicinity when the accident occurred, and added Gonzalez-Saravia was with her son right away.  “It happened fast,” Tupper said. “We are thankful the child is okay. I called the mom last night. We are going to stay in touch with her and make sure they have all the help they need.”  To help avoid similar accidents in the future, Tupper urged parents to talk to their children about safely crossing the street. He said children need to be watched closely, and be with an adult or a responsible older child who can help with crossing.  “Having five kids myself, I know this stuff happens,” Tupper said. “We are just really thankful no one was seriously injured.”  Danielson has been a Marshalltown police officer for 16 years, and works as uniformed patrol. An investigation of the accident is ongoing.  ——  Contact Lana Bradstream at 641-753-6611 ext. 210 or lbradstream@timesrepublican.com.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzcmVwdWJsaWNhbi5jb20vbmV3cy90b2RheXMtbmV3cy8yMDIzLzA1LzQteWVhci1vbGQtaGl0LWJ5LW1wZC12ZWhpY2xlLTIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

So don’t resist it—resistance is futile, after all.”  Bean is well known within the L&D community for her books The Accidental Instructional Designer, 1st and 2nd editions. She’s also the author of several TD magazine articles and is a digital learning professional and senior solutions consultant at Kineo.  Like other individuals, L&D professionals can get too focused on the bells and whistles and cool capabilities of technology. Bean cautions, “Someone getting into ID who is starting as a course builder using a tool like Storyline may make the mistake of trying to build courses that have all the functionality and all the animation and all the clicking. Don’t over-architect the learner experiences you design.”  She adds: “Just because a tool has an interactive type or cool feature doesn’t mean you should make use of it. I call it ‘avoiding the trap of clicky-clicky bling-bling.’ Instead, focus on designing a learning experience that supports the learner to be able to do what you need on the job and avoid all the ‘jazz hands’ distractions that can actually depress learning outcomes.”  Advertisement  Bean is helping guide attendees at ATD23 and facilitated two sessions on Sunday, May 21. During “Best Practices for the Accidental Instructional Designer,” she shared core tips on how attendees can quickly improve their skills in writing better experiences and designing more effective digital learning interactions.  Also on Sunday, Bean was in the ATD Career Center leading “Charting Your Career Path in L&D: From Instructional Designer to Where?” Many of those in L&D joined the profession quite by accident. Is there something else in the future for you, a somewhat divergent road within the field you’d like to explore?  Advertisement  Bean’s session discussed the Talent Development Capability Model to inspire attendees to think about how they may grow and where their skills may shine, and she spoke about her theory, the four pieces of the “learning pie.”  “For those of you getting into the training and instructional design field, think about the big picture that makes up this field. I talk about it in terms of gaining proficiency in the four pieces of pie that make up our practice: learning, creativity, technology, and business. Within each of these pieces of pie, there’s a lot to drill down into.”  A well-rounded practitioner typically develops a deep “sweet spot” where they focus their skill development, states Bean. “When I got started, my focus was on writing and experience design (creative), and I started understanding learning objectives and Bloom’s taxonomy (learning). We were a high-end custom shop, and [although] I left the technology pieces to others, I did have to take on project management and client communication (business).”  Bean suggests that L&D practitioners know their own strengths within the learning pie. “In the 27 years I’ve been in the industry,” she shares, “I’ve grown into all of these pieces a little bit at a time, and I continue to find new areas to learn more about. Lately, I’ve been reading and learning about data and analytics, which is definitely not my sweet spot and not something I would have thought I’d ever be all that interested in.

She was following behind her husband early Sunday morning when his car crashed into a car stopped without lights on I-70.  “My husband hit the car, and flames just flew and I screamed his name because I was behind him watching everything,” she said. She had seconds to brake, hitting his car. “I remember the jerking feeling and instantly I knew I had to get out of the truck to get to my husband.”  Crews said she ran to the car and her brother-in-law was in the passenger seat. She helped get him out and then worked to get her husband Jeremy out of the driver’s seat. All while the engine was now on fire and the flames started spreading.  “I said come on baby you gotta get out of this truck, it’s on fire and first thing he says ‘I’m gone’, he says ‘I’m gone’, he thought he was dead. I said you’re ok, you gotta get out of this truck,” said Crews.  Video from another driver shows the intensity of the flames and you can hear things popping and exploding.  EMS arrived and there were others who stopped to help. Crews said her husband and his brother have several broken ribs and bones but they’re alive.

A single workplace accident can leave a big impact on your business. Between the medical bills, the lost productivity, all the workers’ compensation paperwork, and the low morale, the costs are high. Taking measures to ensure that your workplace is safe, cost effective and will improve employee morale, while also boosting productivity and having a positive impact on your bottom line.  Unfortunately, workplace injuries are all too common. While some workplace injuries will inevitably fall outside your realm of control, you can take certain steps to prevent unexpected incidents at your business. Use these workplace injury prevention tips to improve employee safety at your business.  Workplace safety tips to help in accident prevention is the best way to avoid these costs. Safety guidelines on how to prevent workplace accidents and protect the workforce.  Incorporate a safety and wellness plan  The foundation for a safe work environment is an effective accident prevention and wellness program. Implementing a formal workplace injury prevention program is key to identifying such risks.  Conduct pre placement physicals  Verifying that your potential employees have the professional experience and physical acumen to safely perform all of the duties required for the job can go a long way toward keeping workers safe. Some accidents are caused by inexperience and the inability to physically perform the position.  Educate employees and management staff frequently and effectively  Continually cultivate a safety standard among employees and management staff. Train employees about the importance of following safety measures as often as possible. Many occupational injuries and illnesses can be prevented through an established communication system.  Research safety vulnerabilities  Pay attention to common accidents and develop strategies to keep these setbacks from happening.  Provide protection equipment  PPE is necessary and should be enforced at hiring, meetings, and with impromptu monitoring. Take time to teach employees how to properly use goggles, face protection, gloves, hard hats, safety shoes, and earplugs or ear muffs. Also encourage the employees to attend industry safety workshops and classes.  Have adequate staffing levels  Most of the time, overtime hours are implemented because of low staffing levels. Overworked employees may suffer from exhaustion and cut corners to meet or exceed output. Hiring part-time or seasonal staff could help prevent accidents due to exhaustion.  Inspect and maintain all company vehicles  According to The Occupational Safety and Health Act findings, workplace driving accidents cost employers an average of $60 billion dollars a year. Maintenance should include monthly inspections and repairing vehicles as soon as possible.  Monitor safety measures  After initial training, reinforce safety measures at every opportunity, i.e. staff meetings, supervision, and education. Reward employees who abide by setting standards or staying injury free for a specified amount of time.  Keep an orderly workplace  Poor housekeeping can cause serious health and safety hazards. The layout of the workplace should have adequate footpath markings, be free of debris, and a stations for cleaning up spills. Make sure all instructions are clear and organized to prevent undue mishaps in the workplace.  Be prepared with workers’ compensation  Unfortunately, no matter how much you invest in health, safety, and training, accidents still happen, and a worker can still get injured on the job. When an accident occurs, be sure that you’re prepared by having adequate workers’ compensation coverage. If one of your employees becomes injured or sick while on the job, workers’ compensation insurance can pay for their medical expenses and rehabilitation costs.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhyZGlnZXN0LmNvbS93aHktd29ya3BsYWNlLWFjY2lkZW50LXByZXZlbnRpb24tc3RyYXRlZ2llcy1hcmUtb2YtdXRtb3N0LWltcG9ydGFuY2Uv0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlaHJkaWdlc3QuY29tL3doeS13b3JrcGxhY2UtYWNjaWRlbnQtcHJldmVudGlvbi1zdHJhdGVnaWVzLWFyZS1vZi11dG1vc3QtaW1wb3J0YW5jZS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Now, 7 years old, Fleming is everything you’d expect a little boy to be: Happy. active, curious and full of energy.  When asked what he liked to do for fun, his response was like any other kid his age.  “I like to ride my bike,” he said.  A near-tragedy  Two years ago this month. it almost didn’t seem possible. Wyatt was playing in the yard and had a run-in with a lawnmower his grandmother was operating.  “She was cutting grass and for those big lawn mowers, when you get to the corner you hit a spot where you need to turn around, you sort of have to back them up a little bit to turn them around. And although my children know better, you know, telling them that you know you have to stay away from a lawnmower, especially when it's running. My son has ADHD and it was one of those moments where he was just, you know, 'I want to see grandma,'” said Megan Standish-Fleming, Wyatt's mother.  She said he ran out to go see his grandmother and ran up behind her at the exact moment as she was trying to turn the lawn mower around.  “It was one of those freak accidents,” she said.  When her husband called 911, the ambulance available for dispatch was coming from northern Wake County, taking about 20 minutes.  “Fairview Fire heard the call and said you know this, this does not sound good.

He had an immediate traumatic amputation of his left leg.  Standish-Fleming said firefighters with the Fairview Fire Department had the proper training to help get the blood under control.  “They got him under control and got some IVs going and everything. They saved my son's life. Incredible. Literally saved my son's life and they weren't even supposed to be there.” she explained.  A moment two years in the making  Ever since that day, the family has wanted to find ways like this to thank those who have helped then and now.  “I'm just happy to get out here to see other people just like me,” Wyatt said at the North Carolina Adapted Sports' first Bike Rodeo, Helmet Safety Check, and Touch-A-Truck fundraiser.  NC Adapted Sports showed Wyatt what is possible for him. Over the past two years, they have helped him stay active and provided his parents with the right resources to navigate his new normal.  Dozens of people came out to the Middle Creek Community Center for the fundraiser who also had a big role in helping him.  “He stopped saying I can't do anything. I can't do anything and started saying I can do stuff. I can ride a bike. I can do this,” Standish-Fleming said.  They’re now using this time as an opportunity to help others learn more about resources out there for kids like Wyatt. In turn, it’s helping them heal.  “You can do the things you want to do. You know it might be rough today but you can overcome,"" Standish-Fleming said.

On Sunday in Kansas City, Missouri, Murray found himself hoisting a trophy for the first time in seven years after winning the 2023 AdventHealth Championship on the Korn Ferry Tour. He did so despite a double-bogey 7 on the 18 hole.  Murray put himself in great position after a 64 on Saturday. He opened that round with three straight birdies, had another at 12 and then put his foot on the gas, closing with birdies on Nos. 15 through 18.  On Sunday, Murray birdied Nos. 1, 7 and 10 before an eagle on No. 13. He had another birdie on 16 before parring the 17th. With just one bogey through 71 holes, Murray stumbled a bit on the par-5 closing hole with a double but shot a 68 to get to 19 under and hold off Rico Hoey and Wilson Furr by a shot.  The win was Murray’s second on the Korn Ferry Tour. He also won as a rookie on the PGA Tour at the 2016 Barbasol Championship.  Murray made news off the course for getting into Twitter spats with other pros, particularly Kevin Na.

Despite his injuries, the Academy Award nominee kept promoting his new documentary, “Rennervations.”  During an interview with Jimmy Kimmel, Renner said he was fortunate the plow missed his vital organs. His MCU co-stars, Chris Evans and Scarlett Johansson, made a lowkey trip to Renner during his recovery.  Read on to find out more.  Jeremy Renner Shared His Physical Recovery Update  On Thursday, Jeremy Renner made an Instagram post to update fans about his physical recovery. The “Avengers” actor shared a video of him exercising his legs on an anti-gravity treadmill. He captioned the post, “First attempt at a very light jog with weight-assisted lift for the broken tibia.”  In his update, Renner also shared his short motivation during recovery, writing, “Pain is progress for me.” He said jogging was “a new exercise” and required “movement I’m not used to.” As he jogged and started breathing heavier, Renner added, “Walking and jogging [use] very different muscle groups.”  He’s Shared Clips Of Himself Exercising  Renner has recently shared several clips of his physical recovery progress with fans. The videos showed the 52-year-old actor doing different exercises to regain full mobility in his legs after shattering his tibia.  About a week ago, Renner shared a motivational video showing all his progress since his January accident. The clip showed the “Mayor of Kingstown” actor receiving assistance as he used a walker to take small steps.  View this post on Instagram A post shared by Jeremy Renner (@jeremyrenner)  By the end of the video, which his physical therapist compiled, Renner had increased his stability and speed and walked without assistance. In another video, the actor showed himself working out and said he was taking “the new parts for a tiny test drive.”  Jeremy Renner Narrowly Survived And Had Multiple Surgeries  Renner narrowly survived being crushed under a snowplow on New Year’s Day and suffered significant injuries. This meant over 30 broken bones, including eight ribs, a collapsed lung, and a shattered knee and ankle. A rib also pierced his liver, and his eye socket dislocated.  In April, Renner had an interview on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” to promote his new documentary miniseries, “Rennervations.” The Academy Award nominee discussed his injuries and said he was very “lucky” that he survived the scary accident and that the snowplow didn’t hit viral body parts.

However, it is easily done and could happen to you.  2 Check your gate before boarding - or you might end up in the wrong country Credit: Alamy  Last November, a woman from the US was meant to fly with Frontier from Pennsylvania to Florida, only to end up in Jamaica when the gate changed after visiting the bathroom.  A Brit almost flew home from Turkey to Gatwick rather than Birmingham after boarding the wrong easyJet plane.  And a grandma ended up in Poland rather than Slovenia after a boarding blunder with Wizz Air.  While it may seem obvious when boarding a flight, the issue is becoming more frequent due to the higher volume of flights taking off.  Passengers are able to get through security with their passport and boarding pass, but it is up to them to find the correct gate.  Crew will also usually check passports both at the gate and while boarding - but this can sometimes be bypassed, resulting in being on the wrong flight.  If it is a full flight, your error is more likely to be caught before take off - but if the plane is half empty, you might take off before you realise the mistake.  Some airlines take liability - both Wizz Air and Frontier apologised to their passport and offered compensation when it happened.  However, airlines such as Ryanair say the onus is on the passenger to find the correct plane.  A spokesperson previously said: ""It is each passenger's responsibility to ensure they board the correct aircraft.""  It isn't always that simple - as some airlines have multiple flights to the same destination in one day.  One couple from Manchester only realised they were on the wrong flight to Alicante because their seats were taken - as there were two flights leaving at a similar time.  To avoid it happening to you, here are some ways you can make sure you end up at the correct destination.  Double-check your gate flight number before boarding the plane  Ask crew at the desk for the destination you are heading to  Check with flight attendants while boarding  Flag with crew if someone claims to be in your seat  Here are some other big airport mistakes you could be making.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL3RyYXZlbC84MTY2NTI5L3dyb25nLWZsaWdodC1ib2FyZGluZy1taXN0YWtlLWV4cGxhaW5lZC_SAVNodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGUtc3VuLmNvbS90cmF2ZWwvODE2NjUyOS93cm9uZy1mbGlnaHQtYm9hcmRpbmctbWlzdGFrZS1leHBsYWluZWQvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Mandatory Credit: Cary Edmondson-USA TODAY Sports  Despite the series shifting to LA, the Los Angeles Lakers suffered another defeat to the rampant Denver Nuggets at the Crypto.com Arena. Staring at a series sweep, the Lakers will need to pull off a miracle to make the NBA Finals now. While the night turned out to be disappointing for the Purple and Gold, there was one moment in the game that united the entire NBA fanbase, albeit an unfortunate one. LeBron James‘ mid-game collision with a famous 56-year-old brought out the cruel side of fans.  With yet another close battle in Game 3, physical plays were indeed expected. But definitely not with a 56-year-old official. Though the Lakers are trailing 0-3 in the series, that did not stop their fans from enjoying James’ collision.  LeBron James’ unintended contact leads to bleeding  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad  The Lakers are in big trouble! Initially trailing down 2-0, the Lakers had a perfect chance to even the series with two home games. Anyhow, Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray did not let LeBron James and the Lakers gain momentum. After tonight’s loss, the 4-time MVP’s hopes of his 5th ring might get dashed soon. Amid all these concerns, however, Lakers fans had fun mocking famous official, Scott Foster after The King collided with him mid-game.  Foster is one of the most controversial referees in the NBA. His impact on the games has often been a huge deciding factor. Moreover, Foster’s infamous incidents with Chris Paul are well-known around the hoops community. 38-year-old Paul had a 13-game losing streak in the playoffs when Foster was one of the officials of the game before finally breaking the curse this year. Was James taking revenge for his good friend?  Watch this story: “As staggering insult on live TV leaves LeBron James unfazed, Lakers’ star shoots daggers at Ja Morant’s Grizzlies”  In the game today, LeBron James bumped into Foster when he rushed for a fast break. Though it was unintentional, Foster was seen bleeding as he received assistance from medical staff. Surprisingly, the 56-year-old did not get any pity from the fans.  Scott Foster gets no sympathy from the NBA world  Well, fans believe Foster has made a lot of game-changing calls. Calls that have not favored their favorite team. Thus, after colliding with James today, fans did not pity him. Rather, they enjoyed it for a while.  Here are some of the fans’ reactions to LeBron James’ collision with Scott Foster:  Fans believe even several players in the league would have enjoyed this moment.

Reporters interview an unidentified person who suffered a leg injury in the speedboat accident on May 17. Photo by Eakkapop Thongtub.  The confirmation was delivered during an official meeting held at Phuket Provincial Hall yesterday (May 19). Those present to hear the case update included:  Phuket Provincial Police Commander Maj Gen Sermphan Sirikong;  Chief of the Phuket office of the Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation (DDPM-Phuket) Udomporn Kan;  Chief of the Phuket office of the Ministry of Tourism and Sports (MOTS) Ratchadaporn Oin;  Regional marine office boat inspector Adul Raluekmoon;  Deputy Commander of the Thai Maritime Enforcement Command Center Region 3 (TMECC Region 3) Capt Krit Khluebmat;  Director of the Phuket branch of the Office of Insurance Commission (OIC) Thiraporn Nokkaew;  Noppadon Uwutkampreecha from Tourism Business and Guide Registration Office, Southern Branch 2.  In the presence of all relevant parties, from the Royal Thai Navy to the Ministry of Tourism and Sports, Governor Narong announced that the speedboat captain had been charged with negligence causing injuries to others under Sections 300 and 390 of the Criminal Code.  The captain, whose name was not disclosed in the official report of the meeting, faces a potential sentence of up to three years in prison and/or a fine of up to B60,000, according to Governor Narong.  Thai Criminal Code:  Of note, Section 300 of the Criminal Code deals with negligence causing serious harm to others. The punishment under Section 300 is up to three years in prison and/or a fine of up to B6,000 (read here).  Section 390 of the Criminal Code deals with negligence causing harm to others. The punishment under Section 390 is up to one month in prison and/or a fine of up to B1,000.  However, if the person confesses to the charges, their sentence is reduced to half the term handed down by the court, in accordance with Section 78 of the Criminal Code.  Governor Narong mentioned at the meeting that the police are still awaiting the results of the captain’s blood alcohol test. If the alcohol level is found to exceed the limit, additional charges may be filed.  The same applies to intoxication by other substances, although Governor Narong did not specify whether the captain had been tested for them.  During the meeting, Governor Narong reiterated the same basic information about the Thanathip Marine 555 accident that had been disclosed previously.  Thanathip Marine 555 had 37 people on board when it collided with a channel marker in Chalong Bay on May 17. People on board included:  21 nationals of Russia;  9 nationals of Kazakhstan;  4 nationals of Thailand;  1 national of Hong Kong;  1 national of Mainland China;  1 national of Ukraine.  Two people on board escaped injuries (""code white""): one Kazakhstani and one Thai. 13 people sustained light injuries (""code green""), with no nationalities specified.  16 people suffered moderate injuries (""code yellow""), also with no nationalities specified. Six individuals sustained severe injuries, including broken bones (two Thais and four Russians).  According to Governor Narong’s most recent statement, as of May 19, 16 of the injured individuals remained hospitalised.  Previously Phuket Tourist Police released the names of the people hospitalised. The list included “Mr Satit Maschai, Thai boat driver”. It has not been confirmed yet, if Mr Satit is the man to be charged with negligence causing injuries and severe injuries.  An inspection of Thanathip Marine 555 on May 18 found no technical issues that may have caused the accident.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXBodWtldG5ld3MuY29tL2NhcHRhaW4tZmFjZXMtdXAtdG8tMy15ZWFycy1pbi1qYWlsLWZvci1waHVrZXQtc3BlZWRib2F0LWFjY2lkZW50LTg4MjE2LnBocNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Details on the Box Truck Versus Pedestrian Accident in Stockton  A preliminary release by Stockton PD revealed that Thornton Road near the intersection of Wagner Heights Road was briefly shut down for officials to investigate and clear the scene. The incident involved a box truck and a pedestrian identified as a teenage girl. Additional information on the box truck versus pedestrian accident in Stockton was unavailable due to an ongoing investigation.  Seeking Financial Compensation in a Pedestrian Accident Injury Case  Car versus pedestrian crashes may result in traumatic injuries requiring ongoing rehabilitation and medical treatment. Common pedestrian injuries include traumatic brain injuries, broken bones, spinal cord injuries, road rash, and more. If driver negligence was the cause of the incident, an injured pedestrian may have grounds for a claim for damages against the at-fault party. These claims are generally filed against the insurer representing the motorist that caused the pedestrian accident. Eligible claimants may be reimbursed for medical bills, pain and suffering, wage loss, and more.  Drivers in California are required to exercise a higher duty of care in locations where there are children present, like community parks, neighborhoods, and school zones. When a motorist fails to uphold this duty and causes a pedestrian accident involving a minor child, they may be liable for the resulting losses. It is essential to retain legal counsel in these situations to protect your rights and best interests. Learn how our legal team at AutoAccident.com can help you and your family through this difficult time by scheduling a free case evaluation. Watch this video to learn more about us and how we can help.  How Much Time Do You Have to File a Personal Injury Case?  There is a limited amount of time to bring a case in California. Eligible claimants generally have up to two years to file a case in court, according to CCP 335.1. This deadline is extended for minor children injured in accidents. After their 18th birthday, they have two years to file a case in civil court. Claimants must do so to protect the statute if the matter is not settled within that time. Failing to do so may lead to the court’s dismissal of the case. Do not let this happen in your case, and retain legal counsel immediately following your accident.

"accident","2015-12-23","Not Discerned","{""Tiruchirappalli"", ""TamilNadu"", ""India""}","2023-05-21T02:53:00","MADURAI: The Madras high court has upheld the 6.44 lakh compensation awarded by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal to a man who suffered injuries in an accident while traveling in a Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) bus in Trichy district in 2015.Sathish, a medical practitioner, boarded a government bus on December 23, 2015, to travel from Chennai to Trichy. As the bus crossed Perambalur , the driver operated the vehicle recklessly and negligently. Consequently, Sathish was thrown upward, and hit the bus's roof, He then fell onto the iron rod of the seat handle in front of him causing severe injuries to his vertebral column requiring medical treatment. He filed a petition with the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, seeking compensation.After evaluating the oral and documentary evidence, the tribunal concluded that the accident occurred solely due to the bus driver’s reckless driving. The tribunal also acknowledged the claimant’s significant injuries to the vertebral column, which prevented him from performing his daily activities. Taking into account a certificate issued by a government doctor, confirming the his 40% disability, the tribunal directed the transport corporation to pay Sathish a compensation of 6.44 lakh in 2019.Challenging the tribunal’s decision, the transport corporation (appellant) filed civil miscellaneous appeals with the Madurai bench of the Madras high court. The appellant argued against the plausibility of being thrown up to the bus roof and subsequently falling onto the iron rod of the seat handle, deeming the claimant’s account highly implausible.Justice R Vijayakumar examined the medical records, which clearly indicated that Sathish suffered severe injuries, including a compressed fracture in his vertebra. A disability certificate issued by the medical board verified a 40% disability. The tribunal has rightly awarded compensation in this case. There are no grounds to interfere with the award passed by the tribunal, observed the judge, who dismissed the appeal preferred by the transport corporation.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vbS50aW1lc29maW5kaWEuY29tL2NpdHkvbWFkdXJhaS9oYy11cGhvbGRzLTYtNGwtcmVsaWVmLWZvci1hY2NpZGVudC12aWN0aW0vYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvMTAwMzg5ODkxLmNtc9IBcGh0dHBzOi8vbS50aW1lc29maW5kaWEuY29tL2NpdHkvbWFkdXJhaS9oYy11cGhvbGRzLTYtNGwtcmVsaWVmLWZvci1hY2NpZGVudC12aWN0aW0vYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93LzEwMDM4OTg5MS5jbXM?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

[Right] The 33-year-old victim suffered head injuries as a result of the accident.  She was on her way to get breakfast before heading to work when a van came out of nowhere and changed her life.  Stomp earlier reported that a 50-year-old man was arrested for allegedly driving under the influence of drugs and suspected drug-related offences after the van he was driving hit a woman along Jalan Sultan on Apr 18.  The 33-year-old woman was taken conscious to hospital.  Stomp contributor Candy told Stomp she was the victim of the accident and wanted to share how her life has been impacted by that fateful day.  The single mum of a one-year-old baby said the day started out like any other work day.  At about 7.20am, she was about to enter a 7-Eleven at the Textile Centre to get her breakfast before taking the bus to work  ""Before entering, I felt a sudden sense of unease,"" she said.  ""I looked up and saw a white van driving towards me just 20 metres away.  ""He was so fast and came out of nowhere without any horning or precautions.  ""I tried to dodge but he hit me and I flew onto the pavement.  ""The moment he hit me, my brain went blank and the next thing I knew, I was bleeding from my head with excruciating pain all over my body.  [[nid:517239]]  ""I couldn't stand on my own or move.  ""I was in shock while sitting there bleeding and trying to call for an ambulance.  ""Suddenly, the driver who hit me came out of his van but was incoherent and unable to speak clearly, let alone assist me.""  Candy said two kind cyclists, a man and a woman, crossed the road to come to her aid and helped her to stop the bleeding on her head with their first aid kits.  They also brought her some drinking water.  ""People around started gathering and some even tried to speak with the driver but he couldn't say anything clearly and he started laying down on the pavement,"" Candy said.  ""At this point, the two cyclists and onlookers suspected that he was under the influence.  ""He had knocked down a road sign, busted his van's front tyre and broken the vehicle's front windshield, indicating that he was driving at a pretty fast rate at the time of the incident.""  Candy said when the police and an ambulance came, she was taken to the nearest hospital, Raffles Hospital at about 8.10am and admitted for observation at the accident and emergency department where tests were run and she was examined for injuries.  Aftermath  ""The next day, the accident was reported on the news stating that the Lalamove van driver was driving under the influence of drugs,"" said Candy.  ""A good friend of mine who's also an independent insurance agent contacted me and informed me that for any incident that involved driving under the influence, the insurance company would not cover my third-party damage or hospital bills.  [[nid:628070]]  ""When I received the news at the hospital, I was devastated and feared the high cost of medical bills.  ""I immediately contacted my doctors in charge and asked to be discharged as I couldn't afford to stay longer.  ""The doctors then informed me that apart from bruises all over my body and the lacerations on my head and ears, I had sustained a concussion to my head, two annular tears in my neck and lumbar spine and also a torn ligament on my left knee.  ""I also had a white spot on my right brain which needs further observation to determine its cause.  ""They recommended that I should stay for observation and continue with a follow-up later on, but I conveyed the fact that my financial situation would not allow me to stay warded any longer.""  Candy was discharged on the second day since her accident.  She told Stomp that she has had to undergo three magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, two CT scans and over ten X-rays.  She was advised by her doctor to avoid any prolonged walking, standing, bending of her neck, heavy duties or any kind of sports until further follow-ups and assessments.  [[nid:627923]]  ""My annular tears and injured ligament could take up to two years to heal from my current condition,"" she said.  Prior to the accident, Candy had just started a new job and was in the midst of her three-month probation period, ending on June 7.  ""My new job has been greatly affected as I'm no longer able to fulfil my job scope which involves some manual labour,"" she said.  ""I've been taking unpaid days off as well and have no means right now to get legal help or advice.

The aircraft landed within the perimeter of the base, the defense ministry said on Twitter.  The base, which is about 10 miles (16 kilometers) outside the city, belongs to the Spanish Air and Space Force.  Videos posted on social media showed a plane in flames falling towards the ground.  The air force said several hours after the crash that the pilot was “recovering favorably” but would remain in the hospital under observation for “a few days.”  Spain’s public news agency EFE said the F-18 was training for a flying exhibition when the crash occurred.  The Guardia Civil told The Associated Press that one of its patrols was the first to reach the pilot, who fell outside the exterior fence surrounding the airbase.  According to the Guardia Civil, the pilot suffered injuries to his legs, apparently because he ejected with a parachute from a low altitude. He was evacuated to hospital in a helicopter.  The Guardia Civil said it would collaborate with the military in investigating the crash. It said that the initial information provided by the pilot was that the plane had apparently suffered a malfunction.  The American-made F-18 Hornet has formed a part of the air defenses of the United States since the 1980s and has been purchased by the air forces of several allied countries.  Spain’s air force acquired its first 72 models of F-18 manufactured by McDonnell Douglas in 1983. The fighters, known for their versatility, entered service three years later. Spain's air force later purchased an unspecified number of additional F-18s.  The Zaragoza base is home to a unit of Spain’s F-18s.

The restaurant plans to donate 10 percent of its proceeds to Harper’s family. Share Copy Link Copy  It has been one week since 1-year-old Harper Wren died after being hit by a train in Hardin, Missouri. Her family says it was a heartbreaking accident.Now, the community is working together to honor her memory and support her family. The community has set up a memorial near the tracks where she died with messages of love, stuffed animals, and photos of the almost 2-year-old. ""She had the cutest little cheeks and little rolls. She was just so cute,” her cousin, Sheri Hager, said. “Harper was just a light. She was a light for all of us.""Hager said their family has been overwhelmed with all the support they have received over the past week. “The support has been very much appreciated from everybody, as this has been very tragic for the entire family, for the communities, for the first responders,” she said. That support is widespread. On Saturday, dozens went to a fundraiser at Catfish Charlie’s in Wellington. The restaurant plans to donate 10 percent of its Saturday proceeds to Harper’s family. ""If we can help out in any way possible, we'd be more than happy and that's what we're here for,” Catfish Charlie’s manager Cosette Spencer said. “Seems like people are really wanting to get involved and help out in any way we can.""Hager said the money raised will go toward funeral expenses for Harper and moving expenses for her parents. ""Eventually, they're wanting to relocate away from the train tracks because those were directly in front of their home,” Hager said. “I've never seen such loving, giving, forgiving individuals as those two. It just really kind of gives you some hope.”In the wake of such a tragic accident, her family is asking for grace and kindness. Hager said they have been receiving negative and unkind messages on social media. The Ray County Sheriff posted a video on Facebook addressing some of those messages, asking community members to leave the family alone.""This was a tragic accident,"" Sheriff Scott Childers said. ""For those who are wanting to blame someone, be thankful that you are not in that position. Also remember things can change in a heartbeat, a blink of an eye. Accidents happen. Injuries happen. Kids can walk away.""“Just know that not all details are going to be given. They are very hard to swallow and that information's not for everyone to know,” Hager said. “It was just one of those freak accidents that happened. So, I think the family would just like for everybody to remember, to be kind. And I pray that your family never has to go through something like this.”Hager also said they're hoping to pass Harper's Law. The law would require fences around train tracks in residential areas. She said if it will prevent another tragedy from happening — it's more than worth it.“If we can do anything to make this tragedy a little bit better for others, then that's what our goal is, to try to protect another family from going through this devastation,” Hager said.If you would like to help, there is also a GoFundMe set up to help the family.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rbWJjLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2p1c3QtcHVyZS1saWdodC1jb21tdW5pdHktcmVtZW1iZXJzLTEteWVhci1vbGQtZ2lybC1oaXQtYW5kLWtpbGxlZC1ieS10cmFpbi1pbi1oYXJkaW4tbWlzc291cmkvNDM5NTAwOTbSAYgBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cua21iYy5jb20vYW1wL2FydGljbGUvanVzdC1wdXJlLWxpZ2h0LWNvbW11bml0eS1yZW1lbWJlcnMtMS15ZWFyLW9sZC1naXJsLWhpdC1hbmQta2lsbGVkLWJ5LXRyYWluLWluLWhhcmRpbi1taXNzb3VyaS80Mzk1MDA5Ng?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Consequently, many potholes remain unrepaired, posing an ongoing risk to cyclists and other road users.  While car drivers may experience a jolt and potential damage to their vehicles, the risks are multiplied for cyclists. Even the most skilled and experienced cyclists can face severe consequences when encountering a pothole at speed.  A slight knock or a bumpy ride caused by riding over a deep pothole can lead to a loss of control, potentially throwing the cyclist off their bike. In some instances, cyclists have swerved into traffic, leading to accidents that result in not only damage to their bikes but also serious injuries or worse, loss of life.  Here’s Cyclox member Sushila Dhall’s account of her encounter with a pothole which illustrates just how dangerous they can be for people on bikes.  “On August 11, 2021 the front wheel of my bike hit a deep pothole where Cowley Road had not been repaired properly. I was indicating to turn left and had one hand on the handlebar.  READ AGAIN: Abingdon welcomes new mayor in annual ceremony  “It seemed I fell in slow motion onto the handlebars, cracking my ribs and unable to take a breath. I fell briefly unconscious as I landed on my hand breaking my wrist, and had a seizure due to brief lack of oxygen. I was in hospital for three days, and off work for several weeks. It took my wrist a year to heal properly, as the bone had to be mended with a metal insert.”  Another of our Cyclox members told us that she cycles less frequently due to the worry about potholes on the roads. This reduction in cycling not only affects individual well-being but also undermines efforts to promote sustainable transportation and combat congestion and air pollution.  What can you do to avoid potholes when out on your bike?  •Never let your mind wander. The term sometimes used is “relaxed concentration” when on your bike.  •Don’t hug the kerb. Good road positioning at least 70cm out from the kerb, will keep you away from sunken drains or steeply cambered road edges and will give you more room to manoeuvre around a pothole.  •Swerving out into the road is dangerous. Scan the road far ahead so that you can change your road position gradually if there’s a hazard.  •Pothole depth can be hidden by rainwater so always go around any puddle if you can.  Since potholes present greater danger to cyclists, it’s important that the council prioritises ones that put cyclists at risk. It’s crucial therefore that you report dangerous potholes. The best way to report is through Oxfordshire County Council’s dedicated FixMyStreet website https://fixmystreet.oxfordshire.gov.uk/ Alternatively you can download an app on your smart phone and report through that. Our experience has been that the county council is pretty responsive if a pothole is posing a danger to people cycling.

Neil Dumoulin was left shocked and angry after Delilah, three, was left bloodied and bruised, and extremely upset following the incident on Monday, May 15.  Bosses at Little Green Rascals have launched an investigation into the incident and will share the conclusions when it is finished.  Neil told Yorkshire Live that he received a phone call from staff to tell him Delilah had fallen and hurt herself, just before Neil left to collect her. He took a photograph of Delilah, which shows her bloodied and bruised eye. Neil then took her to A&E in York where the 1.5cm gash was closed with glue.  The dad-of-five has submitted a complaint to industry watchdog Ofsted. Neil said his daughter had previously suffered minor injuries while playing, which were reported to him by nursery staff.  Neil admitted his daughter had been 'clumsy' in the past but he was so concerned about the most recent incident he has withdrawn Delilah from the nursery.  The nurseries' accident report said that staff had not seen how Delilah injured her eye, however she told a staff member she hit it on a chair. The staff member found her on the floor with the injury to her eye, the report added.  Neil said the family had been left ""very traumatised"" and Delilah was struggling to sleep, had been crying and was in pain.  A nursery spokesperson said: ""The safety of children, team members and visitors is the top priority at Little Green Rascals. We are saddened that an accident has occurred to a child within our care.

"accident","1994-08-15","Not Discerned","{""SaltLakeCity"", ""Utah"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T00:00:02","David Mead claimed his wife, Pamela, had slipped and drowned in their koi fish pond after recovering from bunion surgery. The truth, investigators learned, was far more sinister.  Utah Man Killed Wife In Their Backyard Fish Pond And Claimed She Drowned By Accident  On August 15, 1994, neighbors called 911 to report “screaming and howling” at the house next door in Salt Lake City, Utah.  How to Watch Watch Accident, Suicide, or Murder on Oxygen Saturdays 8/7c and next day on Peacock. Catch up on the Oxygen App.  When first responders arrived, a wildly distraught David Mead said his wife, Pamela, had fallen into their fish pond and drowned. He had dragged her body out of the water.  “The EMT there pronounced her deceased,” Salt Lake City PD Sergeant Mike Roberts told Accident, Suicide or Murder, airing Saturdays at 8/7c on Oxygen.  David was so hysterical he was restrained with handcuffs and put in a patrol car. Meanwhile, investigators processed the scene.  What Happened to Pamela Mead?  Pamela, fully clothed, was lying on her back near the koi pond that was about four feet deep and lined with rocks and bricks.  RELATED: Man Choked His Girlfriend To Death In Scrapyard And Staged The Scene To Look Like She Hanged Herself  “On the back of her head they found that she had a fairly small wound,” said Howard Lemcke, Salt Lake County Deputy DA. “It seemed to be from hitting one of those rocks.”  Neighbors who heard the noise from the Mead residence told investigators that it was pitch dark near the pond. They also said that the Meads appeared to be a happy couple. They had been married about three years and were new homeowners.  Originally from Colorado, Pamela, 29, was a flight attendant who was “very kind, very good-natured,” said her friend Saranya Davis.  Pamela had undergone bunion surgery shortly before died, which made walking difficult. Investigators believed that could have contributed to her fatal trip-and-fall.  An autopsy was performed the next day. The medical examiner observed indicators of drowning as well as the laceration on the back of Pamela’s head. He saw no defensive wounds.  “I ruled the cause of death a drowning and I ruled the manner of death as an accident,” Dr. Todd Grey, former Utah State Chief Medical Examiner, told producers.  But the unusual circumstances of Pamela’s death raised concerns with her family back in Colorado. They shared suspicions about David with Utah detectives. Her family also hired a private investigator, Roger Tinsley, to look into what they considered to be Pamela’s “incomprehensible” death.  Related  Tinsley began by interviewing the Meads’ neighbors. Some believed David’s behavior on the night his wife drowned was “over the top,” as though he was acting. While that raised a red flag, it didn’t prove guilt.  David Mead's Affair, Exposed  Then, on August 18, a woman reached out to police and told them that her friend, Winnetka ""Winnie"" Walls, had been secretly dating David. Winnie agreed to speak with the police.  Walls admitted that “she had been David’s kept woman for some time,” said Lemcki, but she claimed that she didn’t know he was married when their relationship began two years earlier. David timed his liaisons with Walls around Pamela’s work as a stewardess.  Investigators also learned that his aviation maintenance business was in financial trouble. Pamela’s family had secured a loan to bail David’s business out. If he divorced his wife, his relatives could recall the note and he didn’t have the means to repay it, detectives said.  David saw killing Pamela as a solution, Walls said.  Walls told police that David’s plan to murder Pamela involved her having a “nasty fall.” Then he’d collect on a $250,000 life insurance policy he took out a few months before she drowned.  When Walls gave David an ultimatum to leave his wife or lose her, he put his plan in motion, according to detectives.  RELATED: Man With Firearms Training Claimed He Fatally Shot His Wife By Accident While Cleaning Gun  Despite their suspicions about David, investigators didn’t have enough evidence to make an arrest. The fact that Pamela’s death had been ruled an accident was another hurdle.  Grey reviewed the case, and found that the wound on the back of Pamela’s head appeared to have been caused by a blow, not a fall.  He deemed the cause of her death “pending.”  Nine days after Pamela’s death, investigators finally interviewed David. He said he was working on the night of August 15 — and that he had asked Pamela to feed the fish.  David claimed that he returned home that night at 11 p.m. When he couldn’t find Pamela in the house, he went to the backyard, where it was dark because the outside lights weren’t on. He found her in the pond.  He admitted to his affair with Winnie, which he downplayed as “a fling,” according to police. David agreed to take a lie detector test the next day.  Related  In the meantime, detectives dug deeper into the life insurance policy. They learned that David’s brother had asked the company not to discuss the policy with authorities.  Pamela’s family then told police that David had also been involved with a woman named Stormy Simon.  They claimed that Pamela had overheard a phone conversation between David and Stormy. David had allegedly said he didn’t want to divorce Pamela and that “it would just be easier to kill her.”  As a result, Pamela went home to Colorado. But a month later, she returned to Utah to work on her marriage.  RELATED: Was A Campground Dispute Between 2 Deaf Men That Led to Death Self-Defense Or Murder?  More evidence accumulated when detectives learned that the lightbulbs in the outdoor lamps by the pond worked but had been unscrewed.  They also learned that David’s family members had since destroyed the pond. David told Tinsley he had the pond torn down so no one else would get hurt.  At this point the investigation stalled. David passed the polygraph, his work alibi seemed airtight, and Walls recanted about everything she’d told police.  David Mead Is Arrested and Convicted in Pamela Mead's Murder  David Mead, featured in Accident, Suicide, or Murder 417 Photo: Oxygen  Authorities were undaunted. “We just kept working on the case,” said Lemcke.  They caught a break when James Hendrix, David’s cousin, reached out. He told police that David asked him to kill Pamela.  “He gave him parameters,” said Roberts. “It has to be while I’m at work. It has to either look like an accident or a burglary or a robbery. I will give you $30,000 from the $250,000 settlement.”  Hendrix never acted and didn’t take David’s offer seriously. Yet days later Pamela was dead.  Armed with this new information, investigators returned to Grey. He acknowledged that he had made an error and changed the cause of death to homicide, according to “Accident, Suicide or Murder.”  RELATED: L.A. Businessman Claimed Girlfriend Accidentally Drowned — But Evidence Pointed To Murder  Although the D.A. needed more evidence to press criminal charges, Pamela’s family filed a wrong death civil case. The proceedings began in late 1996.  One of David’s coworkers told authorities that he had covered David’s shift the night Pamela died. That destroyed David’s alibi, but the civil case ended in a hung jury.  But the hole in David’s alibi allowed criminal charges to be made on August 15, 1997.  Stormy Simon reached out to the D.A., explaining that she had been afraid to come forward before. She agreed to testify at David’s two-week trial, which began in October 1988.  During it, prosecutors argued that David struck Pamela in the back of the head in their dark backyard and then drowned her in the pond.  David Mead, then 31, was found guilty and sentenced to five years to life. In 2016 his first parole request was denied. According to Accident, Suicide or Murder, his next hearing is in 2037.

(HT File)  The accused was identified as Paramveer Singh (19) of Panchkula. A total of three victims have succumbed to injuries to date after the speeding car first rammed into a motorcycle before hitting people present on the roadside near the Dhanas Community Centre on Wednesday evening.  The car with Punjab registration number (PB23-J-0001) is in the name of Kamaljit Singh, the father of the accused, who is one of the directors of a mall in Zirakpur.  “We have arrested the accused, and he will be produced in the court tomorrow. We have gathered enough CCTV footage of the route followed by the car on the day of the accident to establish that Paramveer was driving the vehicle. CCTV footage at many places, including in Sector 38, captured the suspect driving alone”, a senior police officer confirmed.  “We are yet to identify the girl with the accused who was present in the car. We will also ascertain from where she boarded the car prior to the accident,” the official said.  Earlier in the day, police had initiated proceedings of issuing a lookout circular (LOC) against the accused.

Which means up to 2,000 foodies and winos from around the world, many of whom paid ticket prices in the thousands, are hopping between local venues like The Matheson and Harmon Guest House to sample ""the best of Sonoma County and world-renowned food and wines."" They all plan to gather in the west plaza parking lot Saturday afternoon, after the farmers market, for a ""Grand Tasting Experience."" And right in the middle of it, a group of protesters plan to march over to the plaza area from Giorgi Park, demanding that farmworkers receive disaster pay from the local wineries and farms that employ them. North Bay Jobs With Justice, the Sonoma County org helping plan the protest, writes on Twitter:"" While the Sonoma County wine industry is charging $3,900 tickets to celebrate the 'makers behind the magic' at the Healdsburg Food & Wine Experience, the farmworkers whose labor makes it all possible will be marching for DISASTER PAY!"" And former Healdsburg mayor Ozzy Jimenez writes: ""I’ve said it before, Healdsburg is at the epicenter of climate change... when a fire strikes our most vulnerable struggle to pay their bills! Let’s March for disaster pay for farmworkers!!""

The story features a couple of well-known industry leaders in Healdsburg: John Solis, 37, who used to work in management at the Montage Healdsburg resort , overseeing 46 staffers and 150 rooms; and Rosa Salgado, 40, who serves as ""director of housekeeping at all three Piazza Hospitality properties in Healdsburg: the Hotel Healdsburg , h2hotel and Harmon Guest House ."" She reportedly runs the laundry program for a total of 131 total rooms, heading a team of 36 housekeepers. Rosa's four children all work at the hotels and their restaurants now, too, and her sister Yemi is a line cook at The Madrona out Westside Road. ""Our family is grateful for these opportunities,” Rosa tells the PD. “We feel a real connection [to these hotels].” She says her extended team across Piazza's properties often gather outside of work for get-togethers like carne asada barbecues, and bring each other fancy tequila from Mexico when they visit. “There are big examples and small examples — our culture is part of it all,” she says. And Solis from the Montage, who now works at another resort down in Santa Rosa, says of his team: ""We speak more Spanish than English. It’s like a bond we have. It’s part of the experience. It’s how we do what we do.” (Press Democrat; paywall) Firefighters from four different local departments rushed to the scene of a major tractor accident up in Geyserville yesterday afternoon. Here's what they found when they got there, according to the Northern Sonoma County Fire District, the agency that protects rural Healdsburg: ""The driver of the tractor had his leg pinned under the tractor tire. Northern Sonoma County Fire was assisted by Cal Fire, Dry Creek Rancharia Fire, and Healdsburg Fire. After the patient was removed from under the tractor the patient was transported to a landing zone by Bell's Ambulance, and then transported by REACH Air Ambulance to Memorial Hospital."" And here are some more details from the PD: ""A tractor operator was badly injured Friday when his leg was pinned under a tire after the vehicle overturned on a dirt road in Geyserville. The crash was reported about 2:40 p.m. off Nutter Road, according to Northern Sonoma County Fire District."" The man's injury is thankfully ""not life threatening,"" according to the PD.

"accident","2017-07-26","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T03:44:45","MT. HOOD, Ore. — After an unfortunate accident that left him paralyzed neck down, a student at Southern Utah University climbed the tallest peak in Oregon.  When Vishal Shukla was 23, he was in a body surfing accident in California where he broke his neck and was paralyzed in all four limbs. After surgery, he got some devastating news.  “It’s something that a 23-year-old kid never wants to hear. And the exact words were: 'We do not think you’ll walk,'” explained Shukla.  Shukla spent half his life living in Richfield, Utah, and goes to school at SUU. After rigorous training — physically and mentally — he said his recovery is nothing short of a miracle.  “I can use my hands, I can use my arms, I can move around, but my paralysis still affects me to a pretty considerable degree,” said Shukla. “For example, my triceps are still pretty paralyzed — I can’t do a push-up. My grip strength is only a third of what it used to be.”  Fast forward 14 months and Shukla is not just walking, but climbing mountains. This week, he summited Mount Hood — something not many people can accomplish, let alone people once paralyzed in all four limbs.  ""It was definitely a pretty strenuous climb,” recounted Shukla. “But I have absolutely nothing but sheer gratitude for my friends and the crew that we had up there.”  He credits his progress to the teams at Intermountain Health in Murray and physical therapists at Neuroworx in Sandy.  “Thanks to the entire team, the physical therapists, occupational therapists and doctors — everyone did such an amazing job,"" he said.  Shukla also turned his journey into a way to give back to a place that helped him get back on his feet.  “One of the first thoughts I feel like most people have is that you just don’t want anyone else to go through such a similar experience,"" he said.  So he decided to raise funds for families at Neuroworx who might not be able to afford the kind of care they need.  “That money will cover continued rehab sessions that other people’s insurance will unfortunately no longer cover,"" he said.  Donations to Shukla's cause can be made on a GoFundMe page HERE.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxM25vdy5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL3NvdXRoZXJuLXV0YWgtdW5pdmVyc2l0eS1zdHVkZW50LWRlZmllcy1vZGRzLXN1bW1pdGluZy1tdC1ob29kLWFmdGVyLWFjY2lkZW50LWxlZnQtaGltLXBhcmFseXplZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

At 11:06 p.m. Friday, troopers responded to the intersection of state Route 117 and Phillips Road.  They found Braden N. Schick, 43, of Lima, drove a 2020 Chevrolet Silverado southbound on Phillips Road. He entered the intersection and began making a right turn when his vehicle went into the opposite lane of travel.  That’s when a 2007 Volvo semi tractor-trailer driven by Vladimir Zdravkovic, 36, of Winchester, Virginia, which was headed southeast on state Route 117, struck Schick’s truck head-on. The impact pushed Schick’s truck off the norhheast side of the intersection.  The semi-truck and trailer went off the right side of the roadway, down a ditch and into a utility pole. Power lines were knocked down and across the roadway.  Westminster EMS transported Schick to Lima Memorial Health System with serious injuries. He reportedly was not wearing a seat belt, and alcohol was a suspected factor, the OSHP reported.  Zdravkovic did not report an injury.  State Route 117 was closed for several hours as crews worked to remove power lines and vehicles from the scene.  Assisting on the scene were the Allen County Sheriff’s Office, Mid-Ohio Energy, Westminster Fire and EMS, Wayne Township EMS, Minich Truck Repair, Kenny’s Auto Towing and Miller Auto.  The crash remains under investigation by the highway patrol.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpbWFvaGlvLmNvbS90b3Atc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLzA1LzIwL21hbi1zZXJpb3VzbHktaW5qdXJlZC1pbi10d28tdmVoaWNsZS1hY2NpZGVudC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"accident","2003-07-03","Not Discerned","{""SantaMonica"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T12:35:00","Videos by OutKick  Gen Xers remember Ah-nold’s reign as the world’s biggest movie star.  “Predator.” “The Terminator” (and its glorious sequel). “Total Recall.” “Twins.”  Arnold Schwarzenegger, a bodybuilder whose accent was so thick a studio dubbed his lines for 1970’s “Hercules in New York,” conquered Hollywood on his terms. (His voice later returned to the film following his rise to fame)  No one stays on top forever. Now, he may be tacking to the Left to reclaim his Hollywood golden days. So far, the public isn’t buying it, but his Hollywood peers just might.  In fact, evidence suggests they already are.  The descent unofficially began with “The Last Action Hero,” the 1993 film that failed to live up to its pre-release hype. The hits began drying up, and by the early 2000s he gave up acting for politics.  He became California’s last Republican governor, but since his dramatic career shift he’s been tacking to the Left when possible.  Arnold Schwarzenegger Returned To Acting Around 2011  Schwarzenegger was never a hard-Right figure, but his GOP bona fides have softened in recent years. And it’s possible it’s a last-ditch attempt at both relevancy and Hollywood gigs.  The star’s official comeback following his gubernatorial period began with a thud. The 2013 actioner “The Last Stand” featured Schwarzenegger in familiar territory, playing a reluctant hero in an action-packed caper. The movie bombed with just $12 million at U.S. theaters.  He kept going, faring slightly better with “Escape Plan” (co-starring former ‘80s peer Sylvester Stallone) which earned $25 million. He subsequently tanked with “Sabotage” ($10 million) and “Maggie,” an indie flop which earned less than $200,000 stateside.  Even two attempts to revive the “Terminator” franchise fell flat at the box office.  What does an aging action star do when his audience deserts him? Kiss up to liberal Hollywood, which overlooks box office grosses if you toe the proper line.  Schwarzenegger played up to the government’s pandemic narratives in recent years, instructing his fellow Americans to listen to Dr. Anthony Fauci. He went so far as to curse out critics with an infamous “screw your freedom” declaration. To his credit, he subsequently apologized, something neither Howard Stern or Jimmy Kimmel have done following their over-the-top pandemic cries.  The star also compared the Jan. 6 riots to the Kristallnacht pogrom during a heated video shared on social media.  “I grew up in Austria. I am very aware of Kristallnacht, or the Night of Broken Glass…It was a night of rampage against the Jews carried out in 1938 by the Nazi equivalent of the Proud Boys. Arnold Schwarzenegger  More recently, the former governor refused to criticize current California leader Gavin Newsom for collegial reasons.  “When you become part of the club, you don’t criticize governors — because you know how tough the job is.” Arnold Schwarzenegger  He still snuck in a jab or two against Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, who he called “too conservative” for his tastes.  “I was against some of the stuff he did with COVID. But who am I to judge? That’s for the people of Florida.” Arnold Schwarzenegger  News flash: Americans are flocking to Florida, in part, because DeSantis followed the actual science and shook off Dr. Fauci’s draconian measures that produced little but harmed many businesses (and lives).  So far, the actor’s liberal charm offensive is working.  Schwarzenegger is the focus of a three-part documentary dubbed, what else, “Arnold,” for Netflix. He’s also starring in the streamer’s “FUBAR,” an action comedy in the vein of his last big hit, “True Lies.”  Will audiences ignore “FUBAR” like they did his recent films? If so, he may have to start talking up AOC or President Joe Biden to stay in the industry’s good graces.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm91dGtpY2suY29tL2Fybm9sZC1zY2h3YXJ6ZW5lZ2dlcnMtc2hpZnQtdG8tdGhlLWxlZnQtbm8tYWNjaWRlbnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

While walking the 2023 ACM red carpet, the “Lights On In The Kitchen” singer told Taste of Country that she’s been focusing on her health and being extra cautious.  Videos by American Songwriter  The platinum-selling performer was forced to postpone a string of shows in 2021 after she was propelled from a horse in Montana. McBryde landed on her head, which knocked her unconscious. The vocalist was rushed to a local emergency room, where she was diagnosed with a concussion and needed a handful of stitches to “close” her scalp.  The following year, her bandmate Wes Dorethy got into a UTV accident. The instrumentalist had to undergo emergency surgery. After a difficult few months, the band has prioritized looking out for one another.  “We’re taking better care of each other and better care of ourselves,” McBryde told the outlet. “Since we started doing those things on purpose—it’s not like we were crappy to each other—we started being more mindful about it, then I became a member of the Grand Ole Opry, and then I won a Grammy, and then we headlined RodeoHouston. All these amazing things, all this hard work that we’ve been putting in all these years, has started paying off.”  As an award-winning group, they stay far away from dangerous activities to prevent any accidents that can hinder their flourishing career.  “I was just like, ‘Wow, that was so bad. It was so bad,'” she recalled. “We have to take better care of ourselves. So, right now no one’s riding as much as a scooter. No ATVs, no skateboards, no horses.”  Although the accident significantly impacted her tour due to terrible vertigo, she revealed that it also affected her songwriting process. McBryde explained that she now has a refreshing and optimistic perspective on life after they were granted another chance.  “Songwriting-wise, it feels sort of like you can walk into the room knowing no matter what we create today, the thing that I wanted to be when I grew up, I am,” she uttered. “So, even if we don’t get a song today, I’m so happy about who we are and the season that we’re walking into.”  The singer-songwriter is back in action. She previously supported Wynonna Judd on her final tour, performed her smash hit “Brenda Put Your Bra On” at the ACM Awards from her critically acclaimed album Lindeville, and is expected to appear alongside Jelly Roll and Tanya Tucker on the road this summer.

LOUIS, MO – Saint Louis University graduate student Aniketh Vyas says the SLU community treated him like a part of a family, and he is eternally grateful for it.  Vyas lost part of his left leg due to a Jan. 24, 2022, accident on Interstate 64 that sent him, two St. Louis police officers and several others to the hospital with critical injuries.  He walked across the stage at Chaifetz Arena Friday during the School of Science and Engineering precommencement ceremony to receive his master’s in computer science. Vyas completed the degree on time with the rest of his class.  Launch Slideshow Aniketh Vyas celebrates during the School for Science and Engineering pre-commencement ceremony. Photo by Sarah Conroy.  “When the accident happened, the first person to respond was Dr. Pestello,” Vyas said of SLU’s President Fred P. Pestello, Ph.D. “He and some of the global graduate advisors and Eric Armbrecht (associate provost) came immediately, and they took it upon themselves to take care of me.”  On Jan. 24 last year, Vyas was in a ride-share vehicle with other SLU students. The disabled vehicle was pulled off to the side of westbound I-64 with a police presence when another driver came barreling through the crash scene, striking the students and the officers.  “The driver was going 100 miles an hour and lost control of his vehicle,” Vyas said.  Vyas was taken to SSM Health Saint Louis University Hospital, where doctors determined his injuries would require amputation of part of his left leg.  “SLU took on everything while I was in the hospital,” Vyas said. “They took care of everything knowing that I didn’t have parents here, and I drew strength and power from that.”  Vyas said drawing strength from the supporters around him helped him get through the depression that followed the accident.  “I had to reevaluate my life,” he said. “I liked to play games and to run around and travel. I didn’t know right away what my life was going to be without both of my legs.”  The trauma from the accident wasn’t only his – Vyas was on Facetime with his sister telling her that he was okay after the first accident when the vehicle came crashing into the accident scene.  “They have shared this trauma with me,” he said of his family. “They are a part of it, but they are also a part of my healing.”  Healing came through tears and support from the community around him.  “I cried every night for months, but I knew I needed to come out of it,” he said. “SLU went the extra mile with me.”  Vyas said the support from the SLU community was ongoing throughout his recovery. University leaders helped find accommodating housing during his recovery and assisted with his prosthetic. They also worked with the hospital to ensure friends and family could visit.  Vyas said his friends brought him his assignments and would study together in his hospital room so he didn’t fall behind.  “Aniketh demonstrated a remarkable resilience that inspired us all,” said Flavio Esposito, Ph.D., assistant professor of computer science. “I had the privilege of witnessing Aniketh's commitment and dedication to his studies. In the aftermath of the accident, he refused to let circumstances hinder his academic pursuits. His determination is an example for all of us that often find excuses for why we cannot succeed.”  After months of recovery, Vyas faced a setback. An infection sent him back to a hospital room for several weeks.  “He’s been really strong,” said friend and classmate Vamshikrishna Reddy Gantla. “He was almost recovered when that infection came and set him back again.”  Gantla also received his master’s on Friday and is one of the people Vyas credits with helping him get through the past 16 months. He also notes the importance of Kavya Sri Kurada, Devidath Namboori, Sujan Reddy Kandela, Sathwik Reddy and Aashi Pandey in his recovery process.  Vyas said he is looking forward to pursuing a career in computer science, and he credits his time at Saint Louis University for preparing him for the future.  “My mantra is never stop and keep smiling,” he said. “You can adapt and keep going.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNsdS5lZHUvbmV3cy8yMDIzL21heS9jb21wdXRlci1zY2llbmNlLWdyYWR1YXRlLnBocNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

In the video, Ashley was seen violently charging at the other car's driver and throwing racist questions at them for allegedly hitting her car. The incident reportedly took place in San Diego.  The video was initially shared on May 18 on TikTok by @sam.anthabong, who seemed unaware of Ashley's identity. The user asked viewers to spread the clip so that the woman in the video could be identified as nobody deserved to be treated like that. The video was reposted on Twitter by @rx0rcist, and some people identified the woman as Ashley Barkis.  Ashley, who goes by the name 'SAVAGE' on Instagram, quickly went private.

Netizens call Ashley Barkis a racist and a bigot  The text overlay in the viral video claimed that a friend of the creator's friend got into the accident and received racist remarks aside from getting physically assaulted by the other driver.  Ashley's attitude towards the people in the other car, who appeared to be Asian, infuriated the internet. They demanded Ashley's arrest for attempting to murder the other driver by pushing him into the approaching traffic.

Ashley pushed the other driver into the oncoming traffic  Ashley Barkis aggressively charged at the people from the other car, who appeared to be Asian. She alleged that the other driver hit her car and asked him where his insurance was and if he had a driver's license or if he was even legal to be in America.  When the other driver pulled out his driver's license and showed it to Ashley, she violently threw it away and started physically assaulting the man and the people with him. At one point, Ashley kicked the man into the moving traffic, who landed dangerously close to a speeding car.

The accident was reported at 1:50 p.m. Thursday on Missouri 13, just south of Bolivar near the Pitchfork Restaurant, which is located at 4894 S. 138th Road.  ""We are just very blessed, very fortunate, that our students and staff were not seriously injured but we have some significant injuries and bumps and bruises and we know that there is going to be some emotional trauma from this as well,"" Asbill said. ""It is going to take time to help everybody work through that.""  Asbill said school counselors responded to the intermediate school Friday and will be available as needed through next week. The final day of class is My 25.  ""We had some abrasions on the forehead. We had abrasions on knees, arms,"" Asbill said. ""We had a few students who complained that their ankle hurt or their knee hurt from hitting the seat.""  Two third-grade classes and their teachers were returning to Bolivar after a field trip to Smallin Civil War Cave in Ozark. A total of 35 were on board.  Braden Berg, director of communications, said the bus was behind a truck carrying hay when a large bail fell off the back and landed in the middle of the roadway.  Berg said the bus driver attempted to avoid hitting the hay bale but was unable to avoid it and then lost control and drove through the median.  The bus crossed the southbound lanes of Missouri 13 and landed in the west ditch. The badly damaged bus did not hit any other vehicles.  Asbill thanked police, fire and emergency first-responders for responding to the scene.

Options for Justice and Financial Recovery for Surviving Family Members  When a family loses a loved one because of another party’s poor choices, it may be challenging to cope with grief. Any loss of life due to carelessness or negligence may be considered wrongful death. While the loss may have been accidental, it was preventable had the other side exercised the duty of care they owed the lost close relative. Surviving family members may find themselves in the position to file a wrongful death action against the other side to obtain justice and financial recovery. Such cases may be one of a wide array of situations, including pedestrian accidents.  California law allows surviving family members to seek reimbursement for non-economic and economic damages in a wrongful death action after a fatal incident. These include reasonable costs of funeral services, medical bills before the decedent’s passing (recoverable in a survival action), lost income, mental anguish, loss of companionship, and other associated losses. While no amount of compensation will ever fully alleviate the devastation and pain surviving family members are feeling, holding the other side financially accountable for their negligence may help provide a sense of closure moving forward.  The next step to take after losing a loved one in a fatal accident is to contact an attorney to discuss the case in a free consultation to help you understand your rights and options for recovery. Due to California’s two-year statute of limitations, survivors have a short window of time to seek justice and financial recovery for their losses from a wrongful death case.

According to CCP 377.60, the spouse, domestic partner, and child or children of the individual whose life was cut short due to wrongful death have priority for filing. If these family members do not exist, a wrongful death action may be brought in benefit of the putative spouse, stepchildren, parents, and other close relatives who depended on the decedent for financial support.

The prime suspect, Chinna (22) from Chandanagar, who was Jayakrishna’s close friend developed an extra-marital affair with Durga Bhavani during his frequent visits to the latter’s house.  According to the police, Jayakrishna learnt about the affair and since then there have been frequent fights between the couple on the matter. Recently, Jayakrishna had been seriously planning to leave Hyderabad and relocate to their native place.  Durga Bhavani, who feared losing her paramour if she leaves the city, decided to eliminate her husband along with him.

The unnamed 22-year-old man from Wisconsin was wearing a row of silver fake teeth when he suffered the freak accident, resulting in heavy coughing and wheezing.  He was taken to the hospital where an X-ray was taken, revealing he had the 1.5 inch denture stuck in the airway of his lung, according to the case study published this week in the Cureus medical journal.

He's being held on a $25,000 bond.  According to the criminal complaint, a bullet went through the victim's upper left thigh.  Authorities found out about the shooting third-hand. The complaint says Koleske called his mother, but the woman couldn't leave work, so she called her mother who then called 911.  Police and paramedics arrived at 5122 19th Ave. But Koleske and his girlfriend who also was inside initially refused to let them in.  When they got in, they found the three-year-old lying on a bed, crying, with a bath towel draped over her leg. Koleske said he tried to care for the girl himself by giving her Tylenol and wrapping the wound with a towel. He said he even tried using popsicles to help with the pain and slow the bruising.  The defendant maintained the gunshot came from outside of the house, But officers smelled gun powder from a freshly fired gun, and also recovered a bullet and a casing from the bedroom.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) released data this week on 2021 occupant protection in passenger vehicles, finding that of the 26,325 passenger vehicle occupants who died in accidents that year, 11,813 of them – almost 50% – were not restrained by seatbelts.  Officials have not reported unrestrained vehicle crash death numbers that high in a decade.  According to the report, at least 60% of occupants involved in a pickup truck accident who were killed in 2021 were not wearing a seatbelt, a significantly higher number than occupants in all other types of passenger vehicles, including SUV drivers, passenger car drivers, and van drivers.  Accident Fatalities on the Rise  The new report comes as the NHTSA is attempting to reduce a record surge in auto accident fatalities. A comprehensive overview of motor vehicle traffic crashes was released by the agency in April, indicating that deaths caused by car accidents in 2021 marked the largest increase in 20 years.  Such a dramatic rise in car accident deaths has been linked to riskier driver behavior during the Covid-19 pandemic, including speeding, driving under the influence of drugs and alcohol, and failure to wear seatbelts.  Unrestrained Pickup Truck Occupants Have Been At Higher Risk For Decades  Unbelted pickup truck occupants have been considered a high risk demographic for fatal car accidents for over 20 years, the NHTSA noted in a press release. However, the agency stressed that the new statistics are especially concerning.  According to the data, 60% of pickup truck drivers and 64% of pickup truck passengers killed in car crashes in 2021 were not wearing seatbelts. Comparatively, 49% of SUV drivers killed in a 2021 car crash were unrestrained, 47% of passenger car drivers killed in a 2021 car crash were unrestrained, and 44% of van drivers killed in a 2021 car crash were not wearing seatbelts.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFib3V0bGF3c3VpdHMuY29tL3BpY2t1cC10cnVjay1hY2NpZGVudC1zZWF0YmVsdC1yZXBvcnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Rescue workers from Lífsbjörg rescue team in Snæfellsnesbær were preparing to set up lines and glide down to the shore when it was discovered that it was possible to get to the man from the ocean.  There was no lifeboat on site and it took quite a long time to get a boat from the marina at Arnarstapi because the coastal fishermen had prepared their fleet for the severe weather that lay ahead, according to Víglundsson.  A doctor on board the boat then confirmed that it was a fatal accident. A lifeboat later arrived from Snæfellsbær with police and ambulance crews on board to get the deceased from the scene.  The rescue work was completed about 1:30 pm yesterday. The lifeguards from Lífsbjörg were subsequently treated for trauma as is the norm when such events occur.  Asked if the Coast Guard helicopter had been called in for the accident, Jón Þór says it was on a different call at the same time.

After several months, Kevin Hart decided to share a deeply personal revelation regarding the incident, admitting that he had deliberately downplayed the intensity of his pain during his recovery. The reason behind his deception was his fear that medical professionals would discourage him from attempting to regain his ability to walk.

Following the procedure, he spent a duration of 10 days in the hospital before transitioning to a rehabilitation facility, as reported by Entertainment Weekly. In an episode of his show Laugh Out Loud in 2019, Kevin Hart contemplated his life after the accident, revealing his immense challenges in carrying out even the simplest of tasks.  “I could not fu*king move. I could not wipe my a*s…I literally couldn’t do any of that. it makes you realize… you really are helpless. There was nothing I could do,” he said.  During a December interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Kevin Hart shared a profound realization about the impact of his back surgery. He expressed,  “You don’t realize that your back is connected to everything. So coming out of back surgery, everything changed… That’s when you get to see what really matters, who really matters. Life kind of hits you in a completely different way.”  Also Read: Kevin Hart’s Risky Gamble in $801M Dwayne Johnson Sequel Paid Off When He Earned $30M Paycheck: “I’m a back-in player”  Kevin Hart Downplayed His Pain While Recovering  During an episode of the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, Kevin Hart made a candid admission, acknowledging that he had intentionally downplayed the extent of his pain during the healing process from his injuries.  “I lied in the hospital because I didn’t want them to know that I was having pain because I thought that they were gonna stop me from letting me continue to try my walks,” he shared. “I was masking it… because I didn’t want to stop trying.”  Kevin Hart disclosed that he began utilizing a walker approximately seven days into his hospital stay, putting on a facade of mobility by feigning the use of his feet when, truthfully, he was merely “dragging” them along. It took two and a half weeks before Kevin Hart could finally move without the aid of a walker. During this challenging period, he leaned heavily on his family for assistance and unwavering support.

It's shaping up to be a very promising MMO, but it turns out the studio didn't have a massively multiplayer online experience in mind when it set about making the game.  In an interview featured in PLAY magazine, company president Ryan Stefanelli recalls how the game's MMO status surprised those creating it. ""It grew bigger and bigger, to the point where it was like, 'Hey, is this an MMO we're working on all of a sudden?' We definitely didn't pitch it that way.""  CEO and creative director Joe Madureira explains that the game grew in terms of ambition and scope as the numbers working at Airship Syndicate swelled. ""Early on, we were limited because of our team size - we were so small. We had limits that we're starting to push beyond now.""  Wayfinder is a free-to-play title and was first unveiled during the Game Awards in December last year. It's set in Evenor, a world under threat from a force called the Gloom. You take control of Wayfinders, mighty warriors born of the Gloom and tasked with conquering it. To do this, you'll visit dungeon-like areas known as Lost Zones, where you and your buddies can battle enemies and gather resources for customising your loadout and crafting new gear.  Wayfinder's next closed beta takes place on May 24 on PS5, PS4, and PC. The game's expected to release in early access on these platforms in Summer 2023.

"accident","2021-10-25","Not Discerned","{""Merrillan"", ""Wisconsin"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T19:15:00","Neil “Moose” Kinder remembers grabbing his cellphone to answer his wife’s call shortly after colliding with three trees along a rural stretch of road near Merrillan, Wis. He remembers that he didn’t feel any pain, despite the cab of his pickup being crushed in around him after rolling over into a ditch. He remembers hearing birds settling back into those trees he disturbed.  But in a way, Kinder was lucky. He was remembering. He was still alive.  Kinder, 30, recalled that fateful day to a room of first responders, firefighters and medical personnel during Gundersen Health System’s Advances in Trauma Care symposium last week. He did so seated next to the nurse who cared for him during his hospital stay, as well as the flight crew of GundersenAIR that transported him to La Crosse before it was too late.  Kinder was driving down that road on a late October evening in 2021 when he lost control of his vehicle and left the road, only coming to rest after striking the trees.  “After I impacted, I laid there and realized that it did not look good,” he said, his voicing cracking. “I was trying to figure out what exactly I was going to do.”  That’s when his wife Ashley – who worried about Kinder’s safety on those roads after dark – called. He answered his blood-covered phone and told her what had happened.  “I remember the words that I said. I said, ‘Call 911. I’m in a ditch and I’m dying,’” he said.  Eventually, Kinder was transported by helicopter to La Crosse, and shortly after, Ashley and his parents arrived. He saw his mom, and as reality of the situation set in, he told her he was probably going to lose his leg. Then, in a cracking voice, his dad spoke.  “He said, ‘Neil, it’s already gone.’”  Kinder hadn’t realized that to extract him from his vehicle, his left leg had to be amputated above the knee at the scene.  “This made me understand mentally that it was gone,” he said. “There was no trying and failing to keep the leg and all the complications that go along with it.”  But instead of despair, Kinder felt something else.  “I just felt blessed to be alive for my family, no matter what the outcome was going to be,” he said. “I was given another chance to live.”  Kinder was about to begin the most grueling journey of his life, saturated with surgeries to repair the dozens of fractures he sustained. He was filled with staples, plates and screws, and finally, he was fitted for a prosthetic leg. Months of physical therapy and learning to walk again followed.  “The start of fittings was a challenge,” he said. “Not having any strength or balance in my core, lower back and hips, it was a huge challenge to overcome even trying to fit the prosthetic. … And it hurt. The tip of the stump just hurt.”  During his presentation, Kinder showed the group gathered a photo of his amputated limb that was taken by Shannon Brozak, a PA in Gundersen’s general surgery department. He shared it not for the shock value, but because of the value he places on that photo. It’s all he has left of the tattoo that was on the leg – a tire track with his daughter’s name beneath it.  “My oldest had a brush with death when she was 16 months old,” he said. “She was run over, and that was the tread pattern that ran her over.”  Kinder’s still in pain to this day, using medication to ease it just a bit. At its height, he was taking more than 50 pills a day. His parents altered the front half of their house to accommodate his needs. He still sleeps in a hospital bed to be as comfortable as possible. His mother has been a constant caretaker.  Despite those hardships, he’s thankful. The gratitude extends not only to his family, but to those who were on the scene that day who saved his life, and to those who assist in his recovery.  “I’d like to give a big thank you to the guys who took care of me, and the guys who are still taking care of me,” Kinder said. “You are just as important in the process as the support that I have at home. This is the Moose family. Thank you all.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFodHRwczovL2xhY3Jvc3NldHJpYnVuZS5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9idXNpbmVzcy9oZWFsdGgtY2FyZS9ndW5kZXJzZW4tcGF0aWVudC1ncmF0ZWZ1bC1mb3ItY2FyZS1hZnRlci1sb3NpbmctbGVnLWluLXBpY2t1cC10cnVjay1hY2NpZGVudC9hcnRpY2xlXzcyZjZjNTY2LWY2NGQtMTFlZC04OGExLTI3ZmUwYmIxNDE4ZS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

These were the words used to describe Josiah Fowler, a Liberty University sophomore student who lost his life in a tragic cycling accident near Lynchburg last week.  As we’ve reported previously, on the afternoon of May 11, Fowler, of McDonough, Georgia, was cycling solo on English Tavern Road in Campbell County when he was hit by a vehicle. Virginia State Police says he was transported to Roanoke Memorial Hospital, where he died the following morning. No charges have been filed, according to State Police.  Now, those at Liberty University are taking the time to remember the impact Fowler has had during his 20 years in this world.  Many can recall the time Fowler spent on the university’s triathlon team.  Head Coach Heather Gollnick, who will be speaking at his celebration of life service this Saturday at noon at First Baptist Church in Atlanta, said he was unlike any other athlete she has ever met.  “It was a true honor to coach Josiah,” said Gollnick. “He was without question one of the hardest workers on the team. In all my years of coaching, I honestly haven’t experienced an athlete who was more focused, diligent, and determined to learn what was for him a new sport, triathlon.”  Recent graduate and fellow team member JJ Bagans was heartbroken by the news, which came on the first day of Liberty University’s 50th Commencement.  “It’s just a shock,” Bagans said. “A bunch of us were with him early that (Thursday) morning at another one of our friends’ graduation ceremonies. He brought us all graduation cards with a smile on his face. He was one of the purest souls that I’ve ever met, selfless and giving. He didn’t run this race on earth for himself; he ran it for God and for others, as was evident by what he was doing on his last day, celebrating someone else. He wanted to watch us all graduate before he went home.”  As many continue to mourn the loss, Liberty’s interim president, Jerry Prevo, issued a statement on behalf of Liberty:  We are deeply saddened by the loss of this exceptional young man, a brother in Christ, and we will be praying for his family and friends during this very difficult time. We know as believers in the Lord Jesus Christ that Josiah is in the arms of the Savior and that one day we will all be united with each other again.

Use Next and Previous buttons to navigate  A story map created by two Jacksonville seniors that shows all vehicle accidents that have happened in town in the past six years took first place in a statewide competition and will go on to national competition.  Seniors Rachel Lay and Grace Newman created a map pinpointing more than 2,000 accidents to identify areas where a higher number of accidents occur.  ""Growing up, Rachel and I have seen and heard about several traffic accidents that have happened throughout the 18 years we have been alive,"" Newman said. ""We were inspired to do this project because of two separate car accidents that happened recently to students that go to school in Jacksonville ... One of the accidents was at a two-way intersection and the student survived with only a couple minor injuries. The other student was also at a two-way intersection, but unfortunately the accident was fatal.""  The girls worked with Jacksonville Police Chief Adam Mefford to get details of every accident from 2017 through 2022 before plotting them on the map.  They also received data from the Illinois Department of Transportation on traffic patterns, including the number of vehicles that travel through an intersection on any given day.  Using that, they were able to compare the number of accidents to the amount of traffic to see when areas are the most dangerous, Lay said. Streets such as Morton Avenue have a high volume of vehicles and a higher number of accidents but, compared to other intersections, the number of accidents is low compared to the amount of traffic, she said.  ""We believe density is not a cause,"" Lay said. ""We also found that the Central Park Plaza one-way intersection is an area of significance on this map because it had a high amount of accidents for the rate of annual average daily traffic.""  The pair identified several areas that show a high number of accidents in comparison to their traffic volume: the south entrance to the downtown square, and the intersections of West College Avenue and Park Street, West College Avenue and South Church Street; West Lafayette Avenue and North Prairie Street, and Walnut and North Main streets.  Each intersection has its own set of circumstances that Lay and Newman believe leads to a higher amount of accidents.  At the square, limited signage noting the one-way traffic flow could contribute to the problem, Newman said.  At West College Avenue and Park Street, it is only a two-way stop and has limited visibility because of parked cars, she said.  At Walnut and North Main streets, a flashing light and a change in speed coming south into town could confuse drivers, the pair said.  ""There was a wide association between the number of stop signs and the number of accidents,"" Lay said. ""It appears that the four-way stops are safer than two-ways stops or the one-way roads.""  The project took about a month to complete once the data was received, Lay said.  The project was submitted to a state competition and won first place, earning the pair the right to represent the state in a national competition.  Jacksonville High School geography teacher Jim Chelsvig said this is the fourth project the school has submitted to the state competition and the fourth to finish in first place.  JHS has yet to take the top spot in the national competition, but Chelsvig is hopeful about this project.  ""I feel like this is one of our most complete sets of analysis,"" Chelsvig said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm15am91cm5hbGNvdXJpZXIuY29tL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS9qaHMtc3R1ZGVudC1wcm9qZWN0LWFjY2lkZW50cy1qYWNrc29udmlsbGUtdGFrZXMtMTgxMDQ3NDAucGhw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"accident","2023-05-17","Not Discerned","{""WestChesterTownship"", ""Ohio"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T14:21:39","Pay attention for five minutes and you’ll see an Amazon or other delivery truck. This highlights a concern with the continued growth of Amazon and its web of delivery providers: who is responsible when those delivery vehicles are involved in accidents?  Despite the fact that Amazon dictates the routes and schedules of the majority of delivery vehicles – the company is increasingly using delivery providers other than the USPS – Amazon has tried through legal techniques to limit its liability in the event one of the drivers is involved in an accident. The company has done this in part through what are known as hold harmless, or indemnification agreements. These agreements ensure that the delivery companies take responsibility for accidents, even where their drivers are rushing in order to keep to Amazon's notoriously difficult schedules.  And this is concerning, because with the ubiquity of delivery services, accidents are inevitable.  So, who is responsible?  The answer is the owner/operator of the vehicles, which may be sufficient if that they have adequate insurance. The problem arises where the company does not have adequate insurance to cover damages.  Let's look at an example: Smithco operates a delivery service. The company's primary contract is with Amazon to delivery its packages. Smithco maintains a $500,000 liability policy on its vehicles.  John, a Smithco driver, is exhausted, having worked a twelve-hour day delivering for the company, but in order to satisfy Amazon's requirements, must make one last delivery. Tired and not paying complete attention, John looks down at his phone and doesn't see Tim, a pedestrian, crossing the street. He hits Tim, causing severe and permanent injuries.  Amazon, of course, claims that it has no responsibility because it does not own the vehicle and does not employ the driver. Smithco's insurance company will likely pay the entire amount of its insurance policy, but this isn't enough.  In this case, Tim would, after exhausting the insurance policy of Smithco, look to his own insurance policy's SUM, or UM coverage. This coverage provides for supplemental benefits where the wrongdoer's insurance is insufficient to cover the damages. The critical thing here, however, is that Tim must have taken proactive steps to ensure that his SUM/UM limits were high, because if he did not, his carrier would likely have only given him the New York mandated minimum of $25,000.  Assessing and determining liability following an accident can be a complex and confusing process.

Please pray for Cindy, Jennifer, Ike, Abby, and their entire family as well as our staff and church family as we all grieve this tremendous loss together.

The incident highlights the persistence of human trafficking in the mountainous border region, where there has long been a trade in agricultural goods and workers coming from Vietnam to the relatively poor Chinese province of Guangxi.  One of the other victims was Chinese and the nationality of the other has yet to be determined, according to the social media account of the local Jingxi county government.  They were among 14 people aboard an off-road vehicle that overturned and fell into a gully, the government said.  It said the incident was related to human smuggling.  The survivors included the Chinese driver, a Chinese assistant and two Vietnamese citizens, all of whom are being questioned, the government said.  Limited job opportunities in parts of Vietnam have prompted some of its citizens to seek their fortunes in countries where wages are higher, including in marginally better-off parts of China, where they work on farms and in factories and where some women have been lured into forced marriages.

They visited the Fairview Fire Department to thank the first responders who saved Wyatt’s life the day of the accident.  They also got involved with the nonprofit, North Carolina Adapted Sports, where Wyatt met others just like him.  “They opened the door, ‘Hey Wyatt!’ My son’s eyes got about that big around because at five years old he hadn’t seen another amputee, not that he was even aware of,” Standish-Fleming said.  The organization gave Wyatt opportunities like rock climbing and also gave him a special bike — his new favorite thing.  “I loved it!” Wyatt exclaimed.  He also got several prosthetic legs from Del Bianco Prosthetics.  “Watching him be able to do it and hearing him be so excited, ‘Mom, look at me, look look look!’ was the greatest feeling in the world,” Standish-Fleming said.

For people that drive this highway frequently, they don't always think it's the road causing these accidents, but rather human error.  Kevin Hohe says he drives through the Gallatin Canyon often during the winter months, and he believes accidents happen due to drivers' speed.  “If you're grabbing your brakes all the time and you don't use the turnouts, you're going to irritate everybody behind you and people are going to get impatient and bad things are going to happen,” says Hohe.  Montana Highway Patrol Sergeant Cody Ruane says most accidents have to do with careless driving and people getting impatient on the two lanes in the canyon.  “They'll cross on double-yellow lines, improper passing and clipping other vehicles, forcing them into ditches,"" says Sergeant Ruane, ""or even through the winter periods, they'll slide right off and crash into the guardrails or off the side into the ditch as well.”  Ruane says accidents on Highway 191 are on par with last year. From January 1 to May 1 last year, there were 28 accidents, and this year there are 24. There were 13 injury crashes last year, and this year there have been 10 with one fatality.  Sergeant Ruane says there are ways to help prevent accidents.  “There are plenty of turnouts to use if you want to do your Sunday driving, but you need to be aware of those turnouts,"" says Sergeant Ruane. ""Take them when people start backing up behind you. That's what leads to people being impatient and ultimately going to road rage.”  Hohe believes, “If you're not comfortable to drive the speed limit on the road, you probably shouldn't drive the road.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rYnprLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvbWhwLXNheXMtYWNjaWRlbnRzLW9uLWhpZ2h3YXktMTkxLWFyZS1vbi1wYXItd2l0aC1sYXN0LXllYXItZm9sbG93aW5nLXR3by1hY2NpZGVudHMtdGhpcy13ZWVr0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The defendant contested causation based on the minimal impact and lack of damage to the vehicle. The defendant also contested damages.

The defendant identified an accident reconstructionist to testify that the vehicle would have remained under control and followed its intended path using only modest counter steering, resulting in only minimal accelerations of the vehicle. A biomechanical engineer was expected to testify based on calculations performed that there was no injury mechanism to account for the plaintiff’s claimed spinal injuries.

According to the Washington State Patrol, the car’s driver, Sarah Gilman, 41, of Winthrop, and passenger Ann Diamond, 61, of Mazama, were westbound on Highway 20 at about milepost 178, around 9:35 a.m., when Gilman slowed down and began a left turn. The motorcyclist, who was also westbound behind Gilman’s car, attempted to pass and then collided with driver’s side of the car, the State Police said. Both vehicles came to rest on the right shoulder.  Gilman and Diamond, who were both wearing seatbelts, were not injured, the State Patrol said. The motorcyclist was identified as a 45-year-old man from Bellingham, but his name was not provided in the State Police report. The State Police said the motorcyclist was not wearing a USDOT compliant helmet.  It was not known if alcohol or drugs were involved, according to the State Police report.  Several valley residents also reported coming across the scene of a one-car injury accident on Highway 20 near the Weeman Bridge on Sunday evening, involving another injured person being airlifted to Harborview. The car was reportedly well off the road and had only one occupant.

"accident","2021-09-21","Not Discerned","{""Montana"", ""Montana"", ""Bulgaria""}","Thu 18 May 2023 16:34:47","Ashley McBryde isn't just a solo musician — she's part of a band, and the camaraderie she describes among herself and her bandmates sounds akin to being a member of a family.  However, that foundation was shaken within the past two years after McBryde and a bandmate both suffered serious, life-threatening accidents.  McBryde's accident occurred in September 2021 when a horse she was riding in Montana sped off uncontrollably. She fell off the horse and became unconscious upon hitting the ground, requiring ""life-saving"" measures to keep her breathing. She also suffered a concussion and a broken pelvis.  Thankfully, McBryde healed up and was able to resume touring. The band was handed another blow in December 2022, however, when bandmate Wes Dorethy suffered a ""near-fatal"" UTV accident. According to Dorethy's post about the situation, he underwent emergency surgery that saved his life, but still faced a long road to recovery.  When talking with Taste of Country's Adison Haager at the 2023 ACM Awards, McBryde says in the aftermath of both incidents, she and her band have made a concerted effort to treat each other and themselves with kindness.  Since then, only good things have followed.  ""We're taking better care of each other and better care of ourselves,"" she says. ""Since we started doing those things on purpose — it's not like we were crappy to each other — we started being more mindful about it, then I became a member of the Grand Ole Opry, and then I won a Grammy, and then we headlined RodeoHouston. All these amazing things, all this hard work that we've been putting in all these years has started paying off.""  The singer shared that even 18 months after her horseback riding accident, she was still struggling with vertigo and unable to do things she loves. She adds that the incidents have motivated herself and her bandmates to simply ""make better choices"" and stay healthy.  ""I was just like, 'Wow, that was so bad. It was so bad,'"" she says of the incident. ""We have to take better care of ourselves. So, right now no one's riding as much as a scooter. No ATVs, no skateboards, no horses.""  The two near-death experiences for herself and Dorethy also changed McBryde's songwriting process, as she now looks at life with newfound gratitude.  ""Songwriting-wise, it feels sort of like you can walk into the room knowing no matter what we create today, the thing that I wanted to be when I grew up, I am,"" she says. ""So, even if we don't get a song today, I'm so happy about who we are and the season that we're walking into.""  Despite her disastrous horseback riding session in 2021, McBryde says she will ride a horse again in the future, and she's working with a therapist to ward off any negative psychological effects from the accident.  ""I will be back on a horse,"" she says. ""I love riding horses.""

Ron DeSantis would extend liability protections to private aerospace companies if crew members are injured or killed in spaceflights.  The legislation (SB 1318) was among 62 bills DeSantis received Tuesday. He has until May 31 to act on the proposal.  With the state seeing growth in private launches, the bill would cover crew members who are employees or contractors of companies such as SpaceX and others.  Senate bill sponsor Tom Wright, a New Smyrna Beach Republican who chairs the Senate Military and Veterans Affairs, Space and Domestic Security Committee, said earlier this year the proposal “would adapt Florida law to address the evolution of space flight, allowing company employees of SpaceX, Boeing, Blue Origin and so forth to fly to space under this.”  The law doesn’t cover ground crew members or change workers’ compensation rules.  The measure isn’t the only legislation now on DeSantis’ desk that has a tie to the space industry.  A series of road designations in a Department of Transportation bill (HB 21) includes the bridge on State Road 3 over the Canaveral Barge Canal in Brevard County being dedicated to Christa McAuliffe, the New Hampshire teacher killed in 1986 on the space shuttle Challenger.

He first compared the Barbie film and the Fast & Furious franchise saying that the two have some parallels including “amazing” cast lists for both films. He then revealed that he pitched himself for the film during an accidental run-in with Robbie.  “We literally randomly ran into each other as friends. Fast X was filming right across the street from Barbie and they said ‘Why don’t you do Barbie?’ I said, ‘I’ve been trying,’ and Margot makes a lot of decisions for that and I said, ‘Well, I’ll do whatever you need,'” said Cena, who also revealed that he is playing a merman in the film.  John Cena has become a rising star in Hollywood after being the face that ran WWE for over a decade. In recent years, he transitioned into acting full-time and even starred with Margot Robbie in James Gunn‘s The Suicide Squad a couple of years back.

"accident","2023-05-07","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Fri 19 May 2023 00:50:06","Tragedy recently struck in the Albarkawa area of Zamfara State when eight people died in a boat accident. Residents of the community explain to MAIHARAJ ALTINE how the young women and children died while searching for potable water  Gusau, the Zamfara State, capital has recorded several boat accidents as a result of the struggle by the inhabitants to get water from the river very close to the town as both the state and the federal governments have over the years failed to provide the over 500,000 residents with potable water.  The people of the town particularly women and children have to go to the river in canoes to fetch water for domestic purposes, despite the inherent dangers involved. This is because it is the only source of getting water whenever there is water scarcity in the town.  Although many boat accidents have occurred in the town in the past, the one that happened on May 7 when seven children and a prospective bride lost their lives was the most pathetic.  It was very pathetic in the sense that, the victims were mainly women and children among them was a girl called Zainab Yusuf who was about to get married. Her younger brother Aliyu Yusuf was also among those who lost their lives in the incident.  Both Zainab and Aliyu came from one poor family whose parents depended solely on them for drinking water as they could not afford to buy water from vendors who sell a Jerry can of water at N150.  Aged 18, Zainab Yusuf lost her life in a tragic boat accident a few weeks before her wedding which was slated to take place before the end of this month.  Speaking to The PUNCH, the father of the late Zainab, Lawal Yusuf expressed disgust over the incident which he described as the worst thing that ever happened to him.  He said, “I will never forget this throughout my life because I was not at home when the incident happened.  “I was away from home when my neighbour called me on the phone and told me that both my daughter, Zainab and my son Aliyu had died in boat accident.  “I nearly fainted but managed to come home where I met the two corpses lying on the floor.”  Although Yusuf described the incident as an act of God, he, however, blamed both the state and the federal governments for their failure to provide Gusau with potable water.  According to him, the inability of the appropriate authorities to provide water to the inhabitants of the town is the major reason why the people have to go to the river to get water.  “You see, we have to send our wards to the river to fetch water for our domestic purposes because that is the only alternative as the government failed to supply us with drinking water,” he lamented.  He maintained that several lives were lost in the river explaining that, “People will continue to die there, as long as the government fails to address the issue of water scarcity in the town.”  He called on the state government to do something urgently to arrest the current water scarcity in the state capital.  Also speaking, the mother of the two deceased children, Fatima Adamu, said, she sent them to the river on the fateful day to fetch water for the family as according to her, there was no water in the house.  “There was no water in the house on that day, so I asked Zainab and Aliyu to go to the river and get water so that we can cook food and do other domestic activities because it’s the only source of water in this area”.  “As I waited for them to come back, I heard people shouting, saying that, there was a boat accident and many children were in the river”.  “I rushed to the scene to see what was really happening because my children were there.”  “As soon as I reached the river, I met some people trying to rescue those who were under the water”.  “As I waited impatiently by the river bank, I just saw my daughter’s dead body being carried out of the river by the rescuers.  “Some minutes later, the corpse of my son, Aliyu was also discovered and brought out of the water. This made me scream heavily and fell on the ground”.  Fatima explained that all arrangements for the wedding of her late daughter were completed, adding, “We planned to send her to her husband’s house before the end of this month (May.)”  One of the rescuers, Muddasir Sani, said he brought out about seven corpses including that of Zainab.  Sani maintained that the accident happened as a result of overloading, explaining that, “The canoe was supposed to convey only 12 persons but there were over 20 people with their Jerry cans.”  He stated that as the canoe was moving, it capsized and sunk into the river and everybody in it went under the water because none of them was able to swim.  “I personally evacuated seven corpses including that of the girl who was about to get married.”  The community leader of the Albarkawa area where the incident occurred, Yahaya Yusuf, said he witnessed the rescue of some children as well as the evacuation of some corpses.  Yusuf added maintained that six children were saved by the rescuers and eight dead bodies were evacuated, adding that more children were still missing.  He said, “I was around when six children were rescued and eight dead bodies were also recovered”.  Yusuf stated that the people of the area were in dire need of potable water, adding that, whenever there was water scarcity in the town, the people of the area had to go to the river to fetch water as it was the only alternative.  He lamented that between March to May this year, there were three boat accidents which claimed many lives.  He called on the state government to do something urgently to address the issue of water scarcity.  “I am using this medium to appeal to the state government to please come to our aid and provide our people with good drinking water so as to alleviate the suffering of our people”.  “We wrote so many complaints to the state government many years ago but nothing was done.  “Our children don’t go to school whenever there is water scarcity. Many of them have to go to the river to get water for their parents, despite the danger involved in the process.”  Our correspondent gathered that the residents had to be conveyed in boats to fetch water from a part of the river that they considered potable.  But the state Commissioner for Water Resources, Ibrahim Isa Mayana in an interview with The PUNCH, said the problem of water scarcity would soon be over.  Mayana who earlier argued that the boat accident had nothing to do with the water scarcity said normal water supply had been restored to Gusau.  He stated, “Normal water supply was restored in the town two days ago. The eight persons who lost their lives in the river did not go there to fetch water. They were going for another thing went their boat capsized”.  “I am telling you, that, those who have died in the river as a result of the boat accident did not go there to fetch water. They were going somewhere when the incident happened.  However, the state police command confirmed the death of eight persons in the boat mishap.  The command called on the people of the state to always monitor the movement of their wards and check their whereabouts, especially during rainfall.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vcHVuY2huZy5jb20vYm9hdC1hY2NpZGVudC13YXRlci1zY2FyY2l0eS1wdXNoZXMtemFtZmFyYS1jaGlsZHJlbi13b21lbi10by1kZWF0aC_SAVxodHRwczovL3B1bmNobmcuY29tL2JvYXQtYWNjaWRlbnQtd2F0ZXItc2NhcmNpdHktcHVzaGVzLXphbWZhcmEtY2hpbGRyZW4td29tZW4tdG8tZGVhdGgvP2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"accident","2020-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 22:35:25","SYDNEY, N.S. — It is a rather sobering statistic that every day in this country, four people die because of an impaired driver.  While considered one of the most preventable causes of death, municipal police and RCMP are confronted daily with individuals who, for whatever reason, think they can safely drive while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.  In 2020, more than 2,000 drivers in Nova Scotia were charged with impaired-related offences.  The penalties for such offences include the loss of a driver’s license for at least one year (longer for additional convictions), a fine beginning at $1,000 (fines are increased on subsequent convictions) and acquiring a criminal record. There are also fees associated with reinstating a license along with higher insurance fees as a result of an impaired conviction.  In Canada, the prohibited blood-alcohol concentration (BAC) level is 80 milligrams or more (mg) of alcohol per 100 millilitres (ml) of blood.  For cannabis (THC), there are two prohibited levels for THC (the active ingredient in marijuana): it is a less serious offence to have between 2 nanograms (ng) and 5 ng of THC per ml of blood. It is a more serious offence to have 5 ng of THC or more per ml of blood.  The prohibited levels of alcohol and cannabis, when found in combination, is 50 mg or more of alcohol per 100 ml blood and 2.5 ng or more of THC per ml of blood.  Having detectable levels of other drugs such as LSD, psilocybin, or cocaine in your system within two hours of driving is also prohibited.  As part of National Safe Driving Week, Cape Breton Regional Police staged a mock, single-vehicle accident involving an impaired (by drugs) driver and then walked reporters through the steps that officers must take to properly investigate such an event.  The driver, played by Const. Marvin MacDonald, was deemed to be impaired by marijuana. A passenger in the vehicle he was driving was rejected when the vehicle rolled over and later died in hospital.  One of the first police units to attend an impaired accident scene is the traffic safety unit, specifically an accident reconstructionist. Const. Brian Barkhouse displays the latest electronics employed by police to accurately plot an accident scene by using a global navigation satellite system.

"accident","2023-05-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 21:43:42","Mining has increased dramatically on the Tibetan Plateau – and with it pollution and degradation.  View of a river polluted by mining in Maldrogongkar county, western China's Tibet Autonomous Region, in an undated photo.  A search is underway for six workers who went missing after a lift cage fell at a Chinese-backed copper mine in Tibet during shaft construction of an open-pit mine drainage system project, forcing production to stop.  The accident occurred May 14 at the Julong Copper and Polymetallic Mine site operated by Tibet Julong Copper Co. Ltd. in copper-rich Gyama township in Meldrogunkar county of Lhasa prefecture. China’s Zijin Mining Group Co. Ltd. owns a 50.1% stake in the subsidiary.  The six missing miners work at Fujian Xingwanxiang Construction Group Co., Ltd., subcontracted by Tibet Julong Copper Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of Zijin Mining Group, to perform the project construction. Their names and ethnic identities have not been released.  After the accident, Julong Copper began an emergency and rescue plan and reported the incident to the relevant government departments, Zijin Mining Group said Monday in a statement filed with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and posted on the company’s website.  Julong Copper also suspended production and was investigating the incident, which “led to the loss of contact with six Xingwanxiang staff members,” it said.  “The company will continue to pay attention to the Incident, and discharge its information disclosure obligations in a timely manner,” the statement said.  Zijin Mining Group has not posted any updates, and did not respond to attempts to gather more information.  It owns three sites in Tibet, which generate nearly half of the company’s revenue, said Dhondup Wangmo, a research fellow at the Tibet Policy Institute in Dharamsala, India.  Expansion of mining  Mining and mineral exploration have increased dramatically on the Tibetan Plateau since 2006 following the arrival of the Golmud-Lhasa railway link and Chinese government programs and promotion.  With it has come an increase in pollution and a destruction of pasture land, prompting Tibetan protests over harm caused to the environment and local livestock.  A surge in the Chinese government’s mining activities in Meldrogunkar’s Gyama Valley began as early as in the 1980s and has yielded valuable resources such as gold and copper for products benefiting China’s economy, said a Tibetan from the area who now lives in exile.  “But it has come at the cost of environmental degradation and the relocation of Tibetan nomads who grazed their animals there,” said the source who asked that his identity not be disclosed.  “The forced settlement of nomads is a policy that China’s Communist Party has been pushing for years in Tibet,” he said.  The increased mining activity also led to pollution and contaminated water sources that killed animals who drank from them, he said.  “Tibetans in the region have protested over the years — many have been detained and many imprisoned as well,” the Tibetan said.  Operations at one Gyama copper and gold mine was the scene of a catastrophic landslide that killed 83 people, mostly Chinese migrant workers in March 2013, drawing attention to the toll that mining and industrialization were having in Tibet.

Two pilots were in the aircraft but it was not clear who was at the controls. After approximately 20 minutes of circuits, the pilots then flew a low pass parallel to Runway 03, followed by a steep right turn passing over several people while steeply banked and at 72 ft above the ground. During this turn, the aircraft was seen to descend and hit the ground – both pilots were fatally injured.  The investigation could not determine exactly why the aircraft descended in the turn, but no defects could be found with the aircraft or its engine. There was evidence that the aircraft’s electronic displays lost power before the accident and this could have caused a distraction for the pilots. However, the aircraft was being flown in a manner that exposed the aircraft, the occupants and the people on the ground to a high risk of an accident.  While not contributing to the outcome, the investigation identified several shortcomings in the build process of the aircraft and the registration of its ballistic parachute recovery system. The Light Aircraft Association (LAA) and Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) have taken action to address these, with the LAA exploring ways to improve oversight of the build process within the 51% amateur building rules. In addition, during an inspection carried out immediately before the accident, the CAA identified shortcomings in the aerodrome’s safety management system, which the CAA has stated have now been addressed.

DSP Gurmukh Singh pacifying Dhanas residents who staged a protest over ‘police inaction’. (HT Photo)  Police said Mustafa Ansari, 23, of Dhanas died at PGIMER around 3.30 am on Thursday. After battling for life for nearly 24 hours, another victim, Bimlesh, 50, also breathed her last at PGIMER. On Wednesday, Rajwanti was crushed by the car. Four other victims remain hospitalised.  Even as the accident toll rose to three, police were still groping in the dark about the identity of the hatchback’s driver till late Thursday. Having a Punjab registration number (PB23-J-0001), the vehicle is registered in the name of Kamaljit Singh, a resident of Prabhat Road, Zirakpur, and one of the directors of a Zirakpur mall.  The FIR, meanwhile, lodged under Section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of the Indian Penal Code has nominated no accused. If proven, the charge is punishable with imprisonment for life or imprisonment up to 10 years.  Sources in the police said a family member of the car owner was behind the wheel.  Speaking to HT, Kamaljit’s brother said while his relative was present in the car, it was being driven by a driver who fled the spot after the accident.  On other hand, people present at the spot claimed that there were only two people in the car, including a woman. Amid victims’ cries for help, a woman wearing blue and black clothes was seen rushing towards the car, taking out a bag from the navigator side of the car and running away.  Police sources said though the red Beetle is registered at a Zirakpur address, the family is currently residing in Panchkula.  Sources said a police team visited the house of the suspect driver on Wednesday late evening but couldn’t find him. “His phone is also switched off. He also got injured in the accident and fled the spot. We have got vital leads but have not nominated anyone in the FIR, as the investigation is on,” a police officer on the condition of anonymity said.  “FIR was registered against unidentified car driver since there was no one on the spot except the car. Our teams are on the job to arrest the accused,” said Chandigarh SSP Kanwardeep Kaur.  A senior police officer said police will also check the Internet Protocol Detail Record (IPDR) of the suspect to know the exact route he followed and if he was at the accident spot.  Locals stage protest  Meanwhile, Dhanas residents staged a sit-in against absence of CCTV cameras and defunct traffic lights at the EWS Chowk in Dhanas where the accident took place. The protesters also sought the arrest of the accused and warned cops against arresting the wrong person. DSP Gurmukh Singh assured the protesters of fair action.  Police said a team of engineering and traffic experts also visited the spot on Thursday morning. A few protesters also claimed that they saw the man who was behind the wheel.  Among them, Mohammad Jia Ul claimed that he heard the driver requesting a cop to drop him to PGIMER, but the cop asked him to go in a private vehicle. He managed to flee as everyone was busy rescuing the victims, Mohammad added.

According to The Daily Mail, on Wednesday, May 17, Pullos was driven by her father to a Malibu detox and residential treatment facility, which cost roughly $2,600 a week. The outlet notes the location “boasts several alcohol and drug addiction treatments, ranging from a ten-day long detox to a more intensive medication-assisted treatment with a residential option for round-the-clock care.  “An intensive outpatient program is then offered as a transition, as well as an aftercare program for those who use the facilities.”  Just before 1:30 a.m. on Saturday, April 29, Pullos reportedly drove her vehicle the wrong way on the 134 freeway before colliding head-on with a 23-year-old male driver of a Kia who suffered major injuries and rushed to an area hospital. Pullos herself required help from the Pasadena Fire Department who used the jaws of life to extract her from the wrecked 2019 Ford she was driving.  Before the accident, Pullos was also reportedly involved in a hit-and-run with another vehicle, an Oldsmobile driven by a 27-year-old woman from Fontana in the westbound lane, which did not result in any serious injuries.

The new analysis released Thursday by Quest Diagnostics shows that workers who tested positive for THC, the psychoactive component of cannabis, following job site incidents increased to 7.3% in 2022 from 6.7% in 2021, and that the figures follow a steady increase in post-accident cannabis positivity each year between 2012 and 2022.  Analysts looked at more than 6.3 million urine tests across the general U.S. workforce, and found that year-over-year positivity increased in nine out of 15 industries examined during the 10-year period, and that over the most recent five years workforce drug positivity increased in every industry category.  Marijuana positivity was highest in retail trade and accommodation and food services, while cocaine positivity also increased in 12 out of 15 industries during the study period.  The study shows that the combined U.S. workforce positivity for all drugs in 2022 was at the highest level in two decades, and that the 2021 and 2022 positivity rates were the highest they have been since 2001.  While the main focus was on marijuana, the study also showed that amphetamine use was also on the rise among U.S. workers, with positive drug tests for amphetamines increasing by 15.4% in 2022.

Use Next and Previous buttons to navigate  A story map created by two Jacksonville seniors that shows all vehicle accidents that have happened in town in the past six years took first place in a statewide competition and will go on to national competition.  Seniors Rachel Lay and Grace Newman created a map pinpointing more than 2,000 accidents to identify areas where a higher number of accidents occur.  ""Growing up, Rachel and I have seen and heard about several traffic accidents that have happened throughout the 18 years we have been alive,"" Newman said. ""We were inspired to do this project because of two separate car accidents that happened recently to students that go to school in Jacksonville ... One of the accidents was at a two-way intersection and the student survived with only a couple minor injuries. The other student was also at a two-way intersection, but unfortunately the accident was fatal.""  The girls worked with Jacksonville Police Chief Adam Mefford to get details of every accident from 2017 through 2022 before plotting them on the map.  They also received data from the Illinois Department of Transportation on traffic patterns, including the number of vehicles that travel through an intersection on any given day.  Using that, they were able to compare the number of accidents to the amount of traffic to see when areas are the most dangerous, Lay said. Streets such as Morton Avenue have a high volume of vehicles and a higher number of accidents but, compared to other intersections, the number of accidents is low compared to the amount of traffic, she said.  ""We believe density is not a cause,"" Lay said. ""We also found that the Central Park Plaza one-way intersection is an area of significance on this map because it had a high amount of accidents for the rate of annual average daily traffic.""  The pair identified several areas that show a high number of accidents in comparison to their traffic volume: the south entrance to the downtown square, and the intersections of West College Avenue and Park Street, West College Avenue and South Church Street; West Lafayette Avenue and North Prairie Street, and Walnut and North Main streets.  Each intersection has its own set of circumstances that Lay and Newman believe leads to a higher amount of accidents.  At the square, limited signage noting the one-way traffic flow could contribute to the problem, Newman said.  At West College Avenue and Park Street, it is only a two-way stop and has limited visibility because of parked cars, she said.  At Walnut and North Main streets, a flashing light and a change in speed coming south into town could confuse drivers, the pair said.  ""There was a wide association between the number of stop signs and the number of accidents,"" Lay said. ""It appears that the four-way stops are safer than two-ways stops or the one-way roads.""  The project took about a month to complete once the data was received, Lay said.  The project was submitted to a state competition and won first place, earning the pair the right to represent the state in a national competition.  Jacksonville High School geography teacher Jim Chelsvig said this is the fourth project the school has submitted to the state competition and the fourth to finish in first place.  JHS has yet to take the top spot in the national competition, but Chelsvig is hopeful about this project.

For nearly half of his time at Seton School in Manassas, senior Wilson struggled with his faith. After the accident, however, “I began to see the big picture that I had been trying to see for the longest time,” he said. “There really is a God up there, and he’s looking out for me, and I have guardian angels always looking out for me.” Now, he offers every day to Christ, both the good and bad moments.  “I’m just looking at my life as a blessing from God, and I’m still here. So, I’m trying to just spread the positivity around and make sure that everyone can see the good in all situations.”  While in recovery, Wilson was confined to a wheelchair for two months at the beginning of the school year. This period of immobility was difficult for the student athlete, on Seton’s swim, basketball and lacrosse teams.

A car, truck, or SUV sits in a damaged state while it awaits authorities to haul it off. In this case, a BMW 5-Series ended up not just damaged but on a power pole support wire. The driver’s reaction is surprising.  Brought to us by a poster over on Reddit, the short film shows a BMW 5-Series with its front wheels about five feet in the air. The accident itself isn’t shown on film but one way or another, the driver managed to put this 4,000+-pound sedan halfway into the sky before it came to rest.  “Yo, did that really just happen?” the cameraman asks moments before the driver falls out of the car. “Tell me this dude is not drunk,” they say. While there’s no clear indication of intoxication levels, it’s worth noting that the driver seems to attempt to dislodge the BMW by tugging on its trunk. Whether or not they understood that the car would then likely roll back onto them isn’t clear.  Read: Watch A Train Smash Through A Mercedes After Woman Ignores Roadsigns  It’s tough to tell exactly what went down but those seven-spoke wheels indicate that this is likely a 5-Series with the optional Sport package of its day. Whether it’s a six-cylinder or V8 is tougher to say because the video doesn’t show the badge clearly and the rear bumper is destroyed and obscured as well.  The E60 generation of the BMW 5-Series came with either rear or all-wheel drive. So it seems plausible that there might have existed a way to reverse the car off of the support wire given that it had enough traction. That’s better than some previously suspended cars we’ve reported on could’ve hoped for.  advertisement scroll to continue  Either way, there’s no satisfying ending in this video. We’ve been searching for more information about exactly what went down here but haven’t found anything official. Perhaps more news about the incident will surface soon.

On the night of April 28, a golf cart carrying four people was struck from behind by an alleged drunk driver near Charleston, South Carolina, killing 34-year-old Samantha Miller and critically injuring her new husband, Aric Hutchinson, and two others.  The couple had just celebrated their wedding earlier that day, ABC News reported previously.  Hutchinson spoke to “Good Morning America” in his first interview since the tragic accident that killed his wife, sharing how he’s coping with the immense loss after what he says had been a perfect day.  “She was so happy. I mean, planning a wedding, as most people know, is extremely stressful. And she just had a weird, like, calmness that night,” said Hutchinson, who added that the wedding and the reception were one of the best nights of his life.  According to a GoFundMe set up by Hutchinson’s mother, Hutchinson broke both legs, parts of his face, and his back, and suffered brain bleeds and numerous cuts in the accident. The two others in the golf cart with Hutchinson and Miller suffered injuries including severe road rash and open wounds, according to Charleston ABC affiliate WCIV.  The driver of the vehicle that struck the golf cart, Jamie Komoroski, 25, was arrested and charged with three counts of DUI causing serious bodily injury/death and one count of reckless homicide. Komoroski was allegedly driving 65 miles per hour in a 25 miles per hour zone when the crash happened, according to a police report released by the Folly Beach Department of Public Safety.  Hutchinson said he’s not ready to address the driver at this time.  “I can’t right now,” he said. “I’d like to.

"accident","2023-05-18","Not Discerned","{""Huntsville"", ""Alabama"", ""UnitedStates""}","Fri 19 May 2023 00:26:00","HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (WAFF) - The Guest Passenger Statute was written in Alabama during the Great Depression when there were not as many cars on the road. State lawmakers at the time hoped it would encourage people to carpool without fear of being sued in case of an accident.  The Guest Passenger Statute prevents anyone who is riding as a passenger from suing or filing an insurance claim against a driver who negligently causes an accident. A common example is someone running through a red light and hitting somebody.  In 2023, however, cars are everywhere and accidents happen every day. As a result, Bart Siniard, a personal injury attorney, says this law should no longer exist.  ”Nobody really knows this statute exists other than lawyers, judges, and people who have been affected by it,” said Siniard.  Sherri Hurst is Siniard’s client, who was on the wrong end of the Guest Passenger Statute.  “I had no idea, all I knew is I had been injured, and I went out to the insurance company, letting them know what had happened,” said Hurst. “Actually, the driver, it was her insurance so she reached out to them. And they denied it.”  Sherri Hurst had her foot run over accidentally by another driver while leaving the backseat passenger’s side of her family’s car. Her filed claim was denied, so she brought a lawsuit against the driver’s insurance company.  “We went to the Supreme Court and it took over five years to get this reconciled in order for me to be compensated,” Hurst said.  Though Hurst was eventually compensated, the law was never changed.  Siniard however argues the statute is unconstitutional.  He says it violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, by dividing the driver and passenger of a car into separate classes of people: the class of people who can be successful in personal injury claims and another who can’t be successful.  It took Hurst five years and a fight with the Alabama Supreme Court to be compensated, but she’s definitely learned a lesson from her unfortunate accident.  “I’ll drive myself where I need to go,” she laughed. “I don’t carpool much. Or I am in the front, and I make sure that I say ‘Okay I’m in the clear.’”  Click Here to Subscribe on YouTube: Watch the latest WAFF 48 news, sports & weather videos on our YouTube channel!

"accident","2022-05-11","Not Discerned","{""Prospect"", ""Connecticut"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 10:03:03","WASHINGTON — An inbound Metra BNSF Line train was traveling at 60.9 mph when it struck a 33,000-pound box truck at a grade crossing in Clarendon Hills, Ill., in a May 11, 2022, accident that killed a passenger, according to information in the accident docket released Wednesday by the National Transportation Safety Board.  The preliminary accident report was released in June 2022 [see “NTSB releases preliminary report …,” Trains News Wire, June 16, 2022]. The final report, which will determine probable cause and make any safety recommendations, is still pending. The docket, which consists of information gathered during the accident investigation, includes 59 documents with more than 500 pages of data.  Metra train 1242 is normally an all-stops train that would have been slowing for a stop in Clarendon Hills. It was running express because it was behind schedule after a delayed departure to change trainsets because of mechanical problems with the original equipment, according to a report from the rail Operations Group Chair. The train was traveling at 69.8 mph when the engineer spotted the truck stalled on the Prospect Avenue grade crossing and began braking. That group said the crew’s train handling was “not believed to be causal or a contributing factor in this accident.”  The passenger killed was later identified as 72-year-old Christina Lopez of Downers Grove, Ill., who was ejected from the cab car. The train’s conductor told investigators she believed that passenger had been sitting on the engineer’s side, three seats back from the mid-car entry and exit doors on the engineer’s side. That was the location that sustained the most damage, as the truck was rotated by the collision and then struck the lead car behind the doors.  Two other passengers and two crew members were also injured.  Reports at the time suggested the truck may have been caught on the crossing because of traffic resulting from road construction. A suit by Lopez’ family against Metra, BNSF, and Del’s Moving, owner of the truck, claims the road work created unsafe conditions [see “Family of Metra passenger killed … files suit,” June 23, 2022].  But the report on the driver’s actions indicates he told investigators truck’s engine “suddenly cut off” as the truck crossed the crossing, and when he attempted to restart it, the engine did not make any sound. After multiple restart attempts, he and the two other occupants of the truck exited the vehicle when they saw the train approaching. Crash damage made it impossible for investigators to test the truck’s drive train.  Just 48 seconds elapsed between the moment the truck stalled and the collision, based on security camera footage and data from a crossing gate device at Prospect Avenue. According to the timeline contained in the docket’s Signal and Highway Group Chairs’ Factual Report, the crossing gates’ lights activated 13 seconds after the truck stalled; the gates ere down 11 seconds later, and the collision occurred another 24 seconds after that. The 35 seconds of warning provided by the lights is well above the 20 seconds required by the Federal Railroad Administration.  Among other notable details from the docket:  — According to a medical report, the driver did not have a valid commercial driver medical certificate at the time of the crash, having failed to follow up on a request for information from his cardiologist about a recent heart attack. He also failed to undergo required post-accident U.S. Department of Transportation drug and alcohol testing.  — The truck was in violation of a Clarendon Hills ordinance regarding designated truck routes at the time of the collision, having failed to take the most direct route from the closest non-restricted street to reach its pickup point, according to the Signals and Highway report. The driver had followed directions from a GPS device that did not take truck routes into account.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50cmFpbnMuY29tL3Rybi9uZXdzLXJldmlld3MvbmV3cy13aXJlL21ldHJhLXRyYWluLWhpdC1zdGFsbGVkLXRydWNrLWF0LTYwLW1waC1pbi0yMDIyLWFjY2lkZW50LXRoYXQta2lsbGVkLXBhc3Nlbmdlci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Our thoughts, prayers, and full support are with his family,” said district Superintendent David A. Bolton in a statement Thursday.  The accident took place at roughly 10:50 p.m. on May 17 on the 200 block of Allentown Road, the Franconia Township Police Department announced earlier Thursday.  Arriving officers found that a 2016 BMW sedan had left the roadway and crashed into an occupied home. The car was “fully engulfed in flames,” according to police, and officers and members of the Souderton Fire Department worked to extinguish the fire before it spread to the house.  “The driver, and lone occupant of the vehicle, identified as a 16-year-old Sellersville resident was pronounced dead at the scene,” police said.  Five occupants inside the house were uninjured, and the house was inspected by Franconia’s fire marshal and code enforcement department, who declared the home structurally unsafe, police said. The family is being relocated and the house was secured by Moyer’s Restoration, according to police, and no officers, firefighters or members of the public were hurt.  In a statement Thursday afternoon, Bolton said the student was a junior at Pennridge High School, who had “joined the PHS family last year as a 10th grader and this year, he attended the Tech School for Automotive and received his high school courses through our cyber programming.”  “This loss is sure to raise many emotions, concerns, and questions for our entire school community, especially our students, their families, and our staff. The child’s mother has also asked us to continue to speak with other parents about the importance of safe driving,” Bolton said.  School crisis intervention teams are available to assist students, parents, and school personnel, in addition to outside resources, and the superintendent urged students or families to contact their child’s school counselor or the main district offices for additional support. A district spokesman added that the statement from Bolton would be the only comment from the district.  Allentown Road was closed between Lower Road and Banbury Road with the assistance of the Harleysville Fire Police until 1:50 a.m. Thursday. Officers at the scene were assisted by the Telford and Souderton Borough Police Departments, along with the Souderton Fire Department, the Franconia Fire Marshall’s Office, VMSC Ambulance, Montgomery County Coroner’s Office and Franconia Township Codes Enforcement.  As of Thursday morning, the cause of the crash is being investigated by the Franconia Township Police Department, with an autopsy scheduled to be performed later Thursday to determine the manner and cause of death.  “Although the exact cause of the crash has yet to be determined, speed appears to have been a factor,” police said.

CeFaan Kim has more.  SPRINGFIELD GARDENS, Queens (WABC) -- A 14-year-old girl was killed after being ejected from a car as it slammed into the back of a parked UPS truck in Queens.  Police are investigating why a 16-year-old boy was behind the wheel with another minor. The NYPD says he was driving with a Learner's Permit and speeding.  ""As a mother, a mother don't want to go through this. I found her bracelet I can't sleep. I come to get her. I come to get my daughter,"" said Keisha Francis, the victim's mother.  Francis searched desperately through the broken glass Thursday morning for something, anything that would remind her of her 14-year-old daughter, Fortune Williams.  A bracelet was all that was left after the deadly crash.  ""I have three children and she showed me more love than anything else. At night I have to cuddle with Fortune, I couldn't sleep last night. I can't live without my daughter,"" Francis said.  At a vigil on Thursday night, Francis and the victim's aunt were unable to withstand the weight of the excruciating pain.  So many loved ones turned out that the NYPD had to show up to control traffic, with a sea of purple spilling into the street.  Before police arrived, you could hear the sound of speeding vehicles drown out the sound of a mother's anguish.  Fortune was a passenger in the red BMW. Eyewitness News has obtained video but stopped it before it shows the car barreling into the back of a parked UPS truck.  The impact knocked the delivery driver to the ground.  ""The car was coming basically maybe 90-100 mph,"" a witness said.  An eyewitness says the 16-year-old driver of the BMW was tailing a tractor-trailer on North Conduit Avenue Wednesday around 6:45 p.m. when he tried to switch lanes and lost control.  Police, who set up a speed trap a day later, say the teen driver was going at high rate of speed.  The driver survived but Fortune was thrown from the BMW upon impact. She was a student at Springfield Gardens high school and interested in the medical field.  Her life was cut far too short, leaving her mother forever with a void.  ""My life will never be the same without Fortune. Fortune is a sweetheart. She's a loving, caring child,"" Francis said.  Her mother says she was working a double shift the night of this tragedy. Fortune was home with her older sister, but went outside to hang out in her friend's car. Sadly, she never came home.  The 16-year-old driver of the car was taken to Cohen Children's Medical Center where he is stable.

Still, Cowell was grateful that he avoided a worse fate.  “It could have been a lot worse. When I saw the X-ray, I really nearly smashed my spine to pieces, so I literally wouldn’t (have) been able to walk,” he told “Extra” in February 2021.  Cowell is now back and ready to go on the 18th season of “America’s Got Talent.” It will be the fourth season that he teams up with Crews, Mandel, Vergara and Klum. And while Cowell made his name being a no-nonsense judge of talent, he and his “AGT” co-stars all get along famously.  “When we say we are a family it does actually feel that way because we like each other,” he said.  You can catch Cowell and the rest of the gang when the new season of “America’s Got Talent” premieres May 30 at 8 p.m. ET on NBC.  This story first appeared on TODAY.com.

"accident","2023-07-08","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 10:17:54","Dramatic twists and turns and a series of accusations adding more suspense to the unfortunate death of Sub-Inspector (SI) Junmoni Rabha, who lost her life in a fatal road accident on Monday night.  The latest whistle comes from Junmoni’s mother where she has accused the top brass of Nagaon police of “murdering” her daughter as the latter ferreted out their plans of a possible criminal conspiracy.  “The SP and DSP….all are involved in something big and Junmoni might have come to know about their malicious intentions, that is why they killed her!,” Junmoni’s weeping mother said.  She also claimed that the team of police led by Nagaon SP had raided her residence on an ill-fated night and seized more than Rs 1 lakh, apart from a small amount of jewelry. During the raid, she said that a police official allegedly seized her phone and switched it off before deleting several contacts and phone numbers from it.  The police had also threatened her to not speak anything in front of the media, Junmoni’s mother further claimed.  The raid, it’s now said, was conducted on the basis of a complaint lodged against Junmoni at Lakhimpur Police Station in which she has been accused of being involved in an extortion case.  She informed that the police team had arrived at her residence late at night, possibly after the tragic car crash that claimed Junmoni’s life.  Further, Junmoni’s mother claimed that the post-mortem of the deceased cop was carried out without her consent. This raises suspicion as Junmoni’s body had several injury marks indicating that she was assaulted with sticks or rods before her untimely death, her mother said.  In light of such anomalies, the family of the deceased cop has now sought the intervention of Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma into what is being described as a case of ‘premeditated murder’.  Earlier, an informant of SI Junmoni, Hasina Begum, who provided information against a fake gold nexus to her, also claimed that the accident was a premeditated murder. She has bought in serious allegations against the police asserting that Junmoni Rabha was innocent and that the case lodged against her was baseless.  “She has been killed and that the IC of Naoboicha police out post Sanjib Bora, is involved in the whole incident since he had demanded Rs 6 lakh from Junmoni Rabha to settle the police complaint lodged against her by an arrested accused of the fake gold case,” Hasina Begum told News Live.  Junmoni Rabha, who was embroiled in various controversies last year, died in a road accident at Kaliabor in Assam’s Nagaon district on Monday night. The vehicle in which Rabha was travelling in, reportedly collided with an oncoming container truck bearing registration number ‘UP 78UT 4518’ near Sarubhagia village on National Highway 37. Sources said that the vehicle was completely crushed in the accident as the impact was huge.  Rabha was a SI at Morakolong police station in Nagaon who made headlines last year for various controversies she was embroiled in – including corruption, criminal conspiracy, and cheating, for which was also arrested. She was later granted bail by a session’s court.  Junmoni’s death has raised several questions of whether it was murder, suicide or just an accident that turned fatal. Due to this, Director General of Police (DGP) GP Singh handed over the case to CID.  According to DGP Singh, a case was registered against Junmoni Rabha at the North Lakhimpur Police Station on May 15, a day before her death where she was named as an accused. Both the cases including the FIR lodged against Rabha and her tragic death will now be investigated by the CID, informed GP Singh.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c2xpdmV0di5jb20vbmVpdGhlci1hbi1hY2NpZGVudC1ub3ItYS1zdWljaWRlLWp1bm1vbmktcmFiaGEtd2FzLW11cmRlcmVkLWNsYWltcy1wb2xpY2UtaW5mb3JtYW50LWhhc2luYS1iZWd1bS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The victim's mother, Jessica Weaver, has condemned what she described as the inadequate response of the park lifeguards, claiming that their lack of preparation is partially to blame for the tragedy.  Trigger warning: This article concerns the accidental death of a child, the reader's discretion is advised  The Camp Cohen Water Park is managed by the City of El Paso, according to The El Paso Times. City officials have refused to comment on the death of Anthony Malave, stating that the case is currently under investigation. The Camp Cohen Water Park, one of the city's four water parks, was initially opened in 2021. It was closed for an undisclosed period before May 13. The day of the tragedy was labeled a ""soft opening"" event.  Anthony Malave's funeral took place on May 15, 2023  As reported by CBS, on Saturday, Jessica Weaver attended the soft opening of Camp Cohen with Anthony Malave. Weaver told reporters that the accident occurred at approximately 5 pm when Malave was found unresponsive in a pool. Fox noted that the EMS was called at 5:09 pm and arrived at 5:14 pm.  Jessica Weaver said that upon their arrival, first responders attempted to use CPR equipment on Anthony Malave. However, they faced technical difficulties. Weaver claimed that it was clear the lifeguards were not well trained.  Weaver said:  “They weren’t ready to switch out equipment if one wasn’t working properly for this child, they didn’t know do hands on mouth to mouth CPR, they didn’t even say hey this isn’t working, let’s do this, it was like let’s keep going with what we have and see the outcome.""  She continued:  “They kept saying the same thing that it’s not sealing properly around his mouth so he’s not getting the oxygen he needed, but never was there a switch of hey we got another one, here’s another piece of equipment, here let’s try this, it was just traumatizing to watch. ""  Jessica Weaver told CBS reporters that she does not blame the lifeguards but hopes that the city will provide them with adequate training in the future. She added that many of the lifeguards were young, describing them as ""children saving children.""

But I’m glad people are calling out the mom for her lack of reaction/concern for it.  In order to stop further drownings at the city's water parks, Jessica Weaver told reporters from various media sites that she is committed to speaking out against the inadequate safety responses. In a message delivered during an ABC 7 interview, she reminded parents to keep an eye on their children at the pool and to make sure that they were wearing floating devices.  The funeral of Anthony Malave was held on May 15, 2023. His obituary stated that he left behind a mother and a pair of grandparents.  Drowning rates in America  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are approximately 4000 fatal unintentional drownings in America a year and 8000 nonfatal drownings. The Red Cross noted that around 10 people die from drowning in America each day.  Studies show that for children between the ages of 1 and 4, drowning is the most common cause of death. US government sites state that to prevent drowning, parents should closely supervise children who are in the pool and implement a buddy system so that swimmers can look after one another in case of an emergency.

The iCarly actress was on tour for her debut album, Sparks Fly, in August of that year when her tour bus crashed into a semi-truck en route to Kansas. As per research done on internet trends, several netizens are once again taking keen interest in the actress' older accident.  This could be because a video of the actress narrating the accident has gone viral on TikTok, racking up over 142 thousand views and counting.  The TikTok clip of Cosgrove talking about the accident has amassed over 100,000 views (Image via TikTok/@mirandacosgroveupdates)  Miranda Cosgrove's tour bus smashed into a semi-truck en route to Kansas  Miranda Cosgrove was at the peak of her popularity in 2011.  Nickelodeon's iCarly was running successfully, the star had just released her debut album, Sparks Fly, and she toured the United States for her debut solo tour, The Dancing Crazy Tour.  Once Cosgrove released her second LP, High Maintenance, she decided to extend the Dancing Crazy tour into the summer.  cosgrover forever @king_cosgrover    #Cosgroversnation  #Mirandaourqueen  #generationcosgrovers  #Cosgoversreligion The best tour of the world Dancing crazy tour, @mirandacosgrove is the best. she make proyects so greats, so wonderful, she is the best.

A pity of that accident, that driver was so stupid#Cosgroversnation #Mirandaourqueen#generationcosgrovers#Cosgoversreligion https://t.co/GQYISKpW8Z  It was during the extended, Dancing Crazy Summer Tour that Miranda Cosgrove's tour bus smashed into a semi-truck in Illinois. The actress was en route to Kansas after a concert at the Fraze. Instead of swerving to avoid the semi, the tour bus driver hit the brakes, which resulted in the accident.  The accident left the actress and singer with a broken ankle that required surgery. Her mother also suffered concussions. The bus driver was severely injured and had to be airlifted to the hospital. Reports indicate that his arm was sliced right through and required 45 stitches.  ""I like, flew out of the bed and I hit the wall"": Miranda Cosgrove  The viral clip originated from EP #31 of Whitney Cummings' Good For You Podcast, where Miranda Cosgrove appeared as a guest. The actress labeled her accident as a ""Crazy weird thing that happened"" and explained that getting into a car accident was now a big fear of hers:  ""Especially if you're sleeping in a car or for a while after it happened, I would like, wake up in the night because I'd like, remember because I heard a big sound when the tour bus ran into another car.""  Miranda Cosgrove subsequently elaborated on how wearing UGG boots protected her leg from further damage:  ""I like, flew out of the bed and I hit the wall, so my foot like, hit the wall and the UGGs protected it.""  Miranda also had a funny story about her involvement in her mom's concussion. In the accident, a bookcase fell on top of the actress, and she disorientedly threw it off of her, only for it to inadvertently land on her mother. Her mother later suffered a concussion and was knocked out for the entire ordeal.  Miranda Cosgrove's surgeon was clueless about a hole in her foot  In October 2021, the actress appeared in actor Sean Hayes' and Dr. Priyanka Wali's podcast, Hypocondriactor, where she spoke about the extent of her injuries. Cosgrove remembered being relatively calm after the accident after being ensured that her injuries were treatable:  ""I wasn't really freaking out that much I don't know if it's just, you know, what people do when something traumatic happens you're kind of calm for once.""  When the then 20-year-old woke up after the surgery and got rid of her cast, she recalled seeing a hole between her ankle and her knee. She likened its size to that of the top of an expo marker. She said that it eventually healed, but at the time, it looked like someone cut a hole through her foot.  Dr. Priyanka Wali presented a few possibilities for the presence of the hole. Her first guess was that it was related to the insertion of a surgical rod at the time of the operation, but she acknowledged that if that were true, the doctors would know. Cosgrave explained that the medical staff were clueless about what it was:  ""The surgeon was like..., I wasn't in there when that happened, if we had something to do with it, I wasn't in, there. It must've been after I left the room.""  The only answer she got was from her physical therapist, who clarified that sometimes during surgery, it was necessary to make a hole to drain excess blood that flows toward the foot. Dr. Wali said she wasn't familiar with the process but wouldn't rule that out.

What You Need To Know Researchers at North Carolina State University developed a complex model to improve how quickly first responders get to car accidents    In computational testing, the model outperformed the existing techniques    This research can help agencies for long-term planning and on a day-to-day basis  Asya Atik and Dr. Leila Hajibabi are hoping their research will improve how quickly first responders, like police and EMTs, can respond to a car accident.  They developed a model that can help authorities figure out where to put first responder infrastructure, and determine which responders are best placed to reach an accident quicker.  The Ph.D. candidate, Atik, said she really wanted to work on something that would make a difference in the community.  “I personally am educated on optimization and engineering tools,” Atik said. “I’m also getting my Ph.D. in transportation systems, so I was looking into emergency response type of fields. I also want to work on something that I know has a value that will help people.”  Atik said during their research, they looked at statistics in the United States and realized quickly there were a lot of traffic accidents happening nationwide. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, more than five million traffic accidents were reported by police in the United States in 2020; and these accidents led to over 38,000 lives lost.  “It’s important to save lives and of course if there is an accident on the road, you clear the roadway from the accident as quickly as possible to make sure you’re avoiding secondary accounts and maintaining the safety on the roadways,” Hajibabi, assistant professor at NCSU, said.  Through their research, they said shorter response times could help avoid some of these impacts. Using real world data, they developed a model that maximizes the coverage area and minimizes the amount of time it would take to reach accident sites. They factored in things like fleet size, resources available to first responders and dispatching locations.  They said their model did better than existing models in terms of improving response times, regardless of the size of the traffic problem they were responding to. They’re hoping that this work helps inform agencies to make decisions when responding to these emergencies.  To test the model, researchers used data collected by the North Carolina Department of Transportation looking at more than 10,000 traffic incidents that happened in over 10,000 different location in Raleigh.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vc3BlY3RydW1sb2NhbG5ld3MuY29tL25jL2NoYXJsb3R0ZS9uZXdzLzIwMjMvMDUvMTcvbmV3LW1vZGVsLXRvLWhlbHAtZmlyc3QtcmVzcG9uZGVyc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Britain's Princess Diana(AP/ File photo)  On her last day, Princess Diana was with her partner at the time, 42-year-old Dodi Fayed, a film producer and son of billionaire Harrod's owner Mohamed Al Fayed, as Christopher Andersen recounted in the book “The Day Diana Died.”  The couple had come to Paris from Sardinia on August 30, 1997, after spending more than a week together around the Mediterranean. When they left Dodi Fayed’s Paris apartment in a Mercedes-Benz driven by Henri Paul- deputy head of security at the Ritz- they were accompanied by bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones.  When their car entered the Pont de L’Alma tunnel, Paul lost control of the vehicle after which the vehicle collided into the tunnel’s 13th pillar, resulting in a devastating collision that killed both Paul and Dodi Fayed at the scene.  Princess Diana remained alive as first responders arrived on the scene of the crash.  “We took her out of a car, put her on a stretcher, and at that moment the doctor said she was in cardiac arrest. So we gave her CPR, and after 20 seconds she regained consciousness and we transferred her to the ambulance,"" a first responder had then said as per Associated Press.  The car crash occurred as per royal expert Christopher Anderson owing to a number of photographers pursuing the Mercedes-Benz on motorcycles. After chasing after the car, the paparazzi reportedly remained at the scene of the accident, photographing Diana in her final moments.  “I think one of the hardest things to come to terms with is the fact that the people that chased her into the tunnel were the same people that were taking photographs of her while she was still dying on the back seat of the car,” Prince Harry told BBC.  “William and I know that. We’ve been told that numerous times by people that know that was the case,"" he added.  “Those people that caused the accident, instead of helping, were taking photographs of her dying,” he asserted.

Andhure said a major accident was averted as he was driving at a moderate speed.“The incident happened when some of the passengers were about to deboard at Shevalwadi. I was driving at moderate speed and slowed down further as some passengers were waiting to get off. The passengers had asked me stop a little fruther from the designated spot. I looked in the rear-view mirror only to find a rear wheel was about to come off. I slowed down further just before two wheels came off. I somehow stopped it a at a safe point before asking all passengers to get off. My habit of driving at moderate speeds paid off,” Andhure, who is currently posted in Parel depot and has been a MSRTC employee for the past 10 years, told TOI.Commuters have been up in arms against the state transport utility over faulty vehicles leaving its management in damage control mode. However, Shekhar Channe, the vice chairman and managing director of MSRTC called the incident a minor one. “In Mumbai, no buses are allowed to ply after they have operated for eight years. It was not an old bus. There has been a lapse in the maintained or spare parts are faulty. We are investigating the matter. It is unusual for wheels to come off the bus,” he said.Vipul Jain, a regular MSRTC commuter, said that travelling in the buses has become scary. “The Shivshahi buses are in a shambles and other buses have serious faults. Most drivers are rash leading to accidents. The assurance that MSRTC buses will provide safe rides, is long gone, hence people tend to spend more money and opt for private buses,” he said.Meanwhile, the MSRTC will start operations of five Shivai e-buses between Pune and Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar from Thursday.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2NpdHkvcHVuZS9idXMtd2hlZWxzLWNvbWUtb2ZmLWRyaXZlci1hdmVydHMtYWNjaWRlbnQvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvMTAwMzE3MjQyLmNtc9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vbS50aW1lc29maW5kaWEuY29tL2NpdHkvcHVuZS9idXMtd2hlZWxzLWNvbWUtb2ZmLWRyaXZlci1hdmVydHMtYWNjaWRlbnQvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93LzEwMDMxNzI0Mi5jbXM?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"accident","2023-05-10","Not Discerned","{""Taichung"", ""TaichungShih"", ""Taiwan""}","Wed 17 May 2023 16:00:00","Preventing construction accidents  By JeanLiu 柳靖      On Wednesday last week, the jib of a tower crane operating on a nearby construction project fell onto the Taichung MRT’s Green Line, smashing through the noise barrier and landing on the tracks. An MRT train then collided with the crane jib, resulting in one death and 10 injuries.  This accident has caused great public concern. While a preliminary investigation is under way, the Taichung City Government has ordered that work be suspended on nine construction projects, including the one on which the crane was working, run by Highwealth Construction Corp. The city is also investigating the construction companies involved.  The domino theory of accident causation proposed by US industrial safety pioneer Herbert Heinrich says that accidents are often the result of a domino-like series of faults, in which one act of negligence causes more dominoes to fall, eventually causing an accident to occur.  Three such dominos can be seen in last week’s accident, namely failures in the construction company’s outsourcing management, human operations and the Taichung MRT’s emergency response system.  First, the construction firm failed to provide adequate safety measures to ensure the safety of its workers and nearby pedestrians. Second, there was carelessness on the part of the workers. Third, Taichung Mass Rapid Transit Corp’s emergency response system failed to promptly detect and respond to the danger, thus acting as the final domino.  To prevent similar accidents from happening again, the government should implement the following suggestions.  First, bolster its supervision of the construction industry to ensure that construction firms abide by safety regulations and provide adequate safety measures.  Second, enhance workers’ awareness of industrial safety and strictly supervise their operation of machinery.  Third, increase supervision of rapid transit companies to ensure that they effectively inspect, maintain and repair their emergency response systems to ensure passenger safety.  With regard to preventing accidents in the construction industry, the government should respond with measures that go to the source of the problem. The government and relevant departments should bolster their supervision of the construction industry and enforcement of related laws, requiring construction companies and their contractors to strictly abide by regulations to ensure the safety of workers and the surrounding environment.  The government must also increase its supervision of rapid transport companies, requiring them to ensure passenger safety by properly inspecting and maintaining their emergency response systems.  In addition to government supervision, all parties involved in the construction industry must conscientiously perform their duties with regard to safety management by giving their workers a safe working environment and equipment, and ensuring that their employees are properly trained and aware of safety rules.  As for the workers themselves, they must also consciously abide by safety regulations and operating procedures, thus ensuring their own safety and the safety of others.  Accidents in the construction industry have an immeasurable effect on society. The government must protect the health and safety of workers and the public by uncovering the root causes of accidents.  Only in this way can the construction industry continue to develop and make greater social and economic contributions.  Jean Liu is a podcast executive producer.

On Tuesday evening, the licensed practical nurse, 36, and spouse, who retired from the Marine Corps for medical reasons in 2017, shared that their child, who had been hospitalized with serious injuries' over the weekend, was 'doing well and home now.'  'I need to focus all my love and attention on their healing. I'll pop in here and there, but will be lagging on my messages for a bit,' Briana, who runs the Instagram account The Culbersons, wrote to her more than 276,000 Instagram followers.  The couple, who share Troy, 11, Owen, eight, Hank, three, and one-year-old Cora, have not revealed any additional information about the incident.  In the comment section of a video of Hank, uploaded on Wednesday, however, when someone asked how Hank was doing after his fall, Ryan replied that he was 'under concussion protocol, but doing great.'  Distressing: Vicki Gunvalson's daughter Briana Culberson and her husband Ryan revealed that one of their four children 'suffered a terrible accident on Mother's Day'  Scary weekend: On Tuesday evening, the licensed practical nurse, 36, and spouse, who retired from the Marine Corps for medical reasons in 2017, shared that their child, who had been hospitalized with serious injuries' over the weekend, was 'doing well and home now'  Gunvalson has not publicly commented on her grandson's injuries, but did share a card from four of her grandchildren, who she said she missed 'terribly.'  In March, the family moved from to Oklahoma from their home of several years in Illinois to raise their little ones in a 'slower paced country setting.'  In April, when praised for 'present and appreciative' she is with her brood in the comment section of one of her Instagram posts, Briana said she and Ryan had 'through a lot, together and individually.'  'We’ve had a lot of things happen that have made us evaluate what’s important to us and how we want to raise our kids. It hasn’t always been pretty but we’ve gotten to such a place of peace with our marriage and we changed our whole lives for our kids,' she explained of her priorities.  As for how they were enjoying their new residence, nestled between farms with horses and a treehouse in their backyard, the mother-of-three said the new setting has been 'so peaceful' and they were all 'loving it.'  Last year, Briana and Ryan welcomed their baby girl named Cora Rose, who they called a 'beautiful healthy blessing.'  She's maintains a mostly private life away from social media aside from her keto-inspired page where she gives followers updates on her day-to-day food choices on the mostly no-carb lifestyle.  Briana found fame at a young age as the daughter of the real OG from the OC, Vicki Gunvalson, who starred on the Real Housewives of Orange County from its inception in 2006 through 2019 when she left the show for good.  'I need to focus all my love and attention on their healing. I'll pop in here and there, but will be lagging on my messages for a bit,' Briana, who runs the Instagram account The Culbersons, wrote to her more than 276,000 Instagram followers  Fresh start: In March, the family moved from to Oklahoma from their home of several years in Illinois to raise their little ones in a 'slower paced country setting'  She celebrated her 12-year wedding anniversary with Ryan in October.  Prior to living in Oklahoma and Illinois, they previously resided in North Carolina for years.  Earlier this month, she opened up about knowing since she was 'old enough to remember' that she 'wanted to be a nurse.'  'My mom had health problems and many surgeries when I was a child. I always felt comfortable at the hospitals and taking care of her at home. That was easy, I knew I wanted to help people and it is the purpose for my life. I started working in the ER at 18 years old and graduated with my bachelors of science in nursing right after I turned 22. I spent 17 years in the ER and loved it, I even miss it daily,' she wrote on her Instagram account.  Beloved grandma: Gunvalson has not publicly commented on her grandson's injuries, but did share a card from four of her grandchildren, who she said she missed 'terribly'  Back in 2017, Briana was left 'fighting for her life' after surgeons made a mistake and operated on her with a dirty scalpel while performing a surgery to treat her lupus.  'It almost killed my daughter,' Vicki told People, at the time. '[The scalpel was infected] with feces from a previous surgery that day they put inside her body.'  The reality star stressed: ''So, not good, she almost lost her leg. She almost died and all this stuff.'  In 2018, she was hospitalized again and tried the keto diet with her husband to see if it would help her illness.  And after a year on the diet, she lost 45 pounds.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvdHZzaG93Yml6L2FydGljbGUtMTIwOTYyOTMvVmlja2ktR3VudmFsc29ucy1ncmFuZGNoaWxkLXN1ZmZlcmVkLXRlcnJpYmxlLWFjY2lkZW50LU1vdGhlcnMtRGF5LWhvc3BpdGFsaXplZC5odG1s0gGPAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay90dnNob3diaXovYXJ0aWNsZS0xMjA5NjI5My9hbXAvVmlja2ktR3VudmFsc29ucy1ncmFuZGNoaWxkLXN1ZmZlcmVkLXRlcnJpYmxlLWFjY2lkZW50LU1vdGhlcnMtRGF5LWhvc3BpdGFsaXplZC5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"accident","2023-05-05","Not Discerned","{""Laredo"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 16:09:00","LAREDO, TX. (KGNS) - Two weeks ago, a young man recently lost his life after a car accident on Loop 20 and Havana Drive.  It’s the latest incident that has city officials looking for ways to prevent more vehicle fatalities from happening at the same location.  Loop 20 is a busy road that gets drivers from one end of Laredo to another but over the years, it has become a hot spot for some of the deadliest car accidents.  From motorcyclists crashing into a ditch to most recently a rollover that claimed the life of a 22-year-old.  With so many accidents happening back-to-back, District Six councilmember Dr. Tyler king believes now is the time to act.  “I asked for a long-term plan to address this, and with city and traffic and police there’s a two prone approach that you got to fix an issue, but you also have to fix the speeding as well,” said Dr. King.  According to Dr. King the plan is a two-phase approach.  “Create a concrete barrier to replace those flimsy poles that do little to nothing, from International to approximately Shiloh. On top of that, an unofficial plan from TxDOT at this time is to narrow the loop in that eastward-eastbound section to a two lane around that shortest curve,” said Dr. King.  It is the councilmember’s hope that these measures could help reduce the number of accidents in the area.  Now, as an added layer of protection, Investigator Joe Baeza with the Laredo Police Deparment said they have increased police presence following the recent accidents.  “I think what people do really need to know is that what they need to realize is that we augmented the enforcement of the area quite a bit,” said Baeza.  Baeza adds that the issue also requires the help of the community.  “They have to do their part, if everybody were to travel the posting speed limit its almost very hard to get into any kind of trouble,” said Baeza.  So the next time you drive through Loop 20, officials encourage you to remain alert and follow the speed limit so that you get home to your loved ones safe and sound.  According to TxDOT, the concrete barrier installation project will begin in 2024.  For more headlines. click here.  Copyright 2023 KGNS.

I get it, I wasn’t a piece for the puzzle.”  “Barbie” is set to party its way into theaters July 21. ©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection  “I think a lot of times people think, ‘Oh, he wouldn’t do that,’ ” continued Cena. “I don’t think there are any small parts. A chance is a chance. An opportunity to show your skill or develop a new skill, that’s fantastic. That’s why I want to do all this stuff, so I think once they realized I would just be grateful to be involved, they were like, ‘Yeah, you can do this.’ “  Cena will flip his fin alongside pop star Dua Lipa who was revealed to be playing the mermaid version of the popular Mattel doll.

The account claimed in the caption that it was an animated demonstration of a real incident that took place in 2016.  It further stated that the video of the incident was taken in Florida, where a 34-year-old person named Courtney Winston ran over a group of college students in an unfortunate accident, and none of the victims survived the impact of the hit.  Now TikTok users were confused as they tried to decipher whether or not the claim was true. Such notorious claims are not unusual on social media, as many accounts on different social media platforms are dedicated to spreading hoaxes and false and deceptive claims to baffle viewers.  However, no car accident involving that name and a group of college students was reported in December 2016. There is no other evidence supporting the supposed incident either.  TikTok users react to Courtney Winston car accident claim  The animated clip shared by @rbxleak is only a couple of seconds long, where a car is shown driving down a road. It’s displayed from a first-person perspective, like racing games. Then suddenly, the car collides with a group of people trying to cross the road, and the victims are seen immediately flown across the road. A loud screeching of a female is heard.  Here's how some people on TikTok reacted to the video:  TikTok users react to animated Courtney Winston car accident video.

When authorities found Herwig’s pickup, they allegedly found damage on the front of the vehicle that matched parts found at the scene of the accident.  According to court documents, Herwig told officers that he knew he hit something, but he wasn’t sure what it was. When asked by officers if it was possible he hit a person, Herwig reportedly said that it “could’ve been.”  Documents identify the bicyclist as Phillip Watterson, a resident of Cherokee.

(WXIX) - The family of a Northern Kentucky man is in despair after their loved one was removed from life support three months after a tragic farm accident.  Larry Posey, 74, passed on Mother’s Day from injuries he suffered after he was run over by a tractor while working on a farm along Duncan Road in Crittenden.  “I’m dead inside,” said Tracey Deleon, Posey’s daughter. “I’m dying right now. It’s like, killing me.”  Deleon is in gut-wrenching pain without her father.  “Every night I’m on my back porch, sitting away from the kids so they don’t see the emotions, until 3 a.m. I’m crying out on the porch by myself,” Deleon said.  The accident happened on Feb. 13 as Posey was helping a friend repair a tractor on the farm he owns. Deleon says later that evening, they got the call.  “There were a couple of different stories. First, it was told that once the filter was put on, the tractor jumped out of gear and ran over him,” she said “Then another story was told that he was under it... We’re not sure exactly which of those stories is the truth.”  UC Air Care flew her father to the University of Cincinnati Medical Center with a fractured skull, fractured ribs and a punctured lung. He was placed on life support and eventually transferred to The Christ Hospital, where he would die three months later.  “With him gone, that leaves us with nothing,” Deleon said. “I call his cell phone just to hear his voice on his voicemail. I’m lost.”  She says the work her father was doing that day was typical of the man renowned locally as a handyman who didn’t mind getting his hands dirty and bending over backward for those who needed him.  “He would come up and help on the farm to not be sitting,” she said. “He would cut the grass, he would take care of the cows, and he would take care of the horses... He was a great person. The best.”  Deleon says Posey was a retired coal miner and a major financial provider for the family. Now she’s hopeful an online fundraiser created in his honor will raise enough to cover his funeral expenses.  “My dad was amazing. He was amazing. He taught me everything I need to know about car work. He was always there for me. Always there for me,” she said “He deserves to be buried with dignity and respect. No matter what I have to do.”  The family is working with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to determine what exactly happened.  See a spelling or grammar error in our story?

The said road is known often called ‘killer road’ due to its poor condition, particularly within the limits of the Municipal Councils of Mandi Gobindgarh and Amloh.  The road has been playing havoc with the lives of the public and accidents here have become a routine.  The deceased has been identified as Jaswinder Singh of Shanti Nagar. He was working as a peon at the Motia Khan branch of Union Bank. As per the police, the deceased was returning home after duty. As he reached near a restaurant on the Amloh road, a speeding truck hit his scooter. Jaswinder fell on the ground and was crushed by the truck. He died on the spot.  The Mandi Gobindgarh-Nabha road, which connects the area with Sangrur and Malwa, has been in a poor condition since long. Potholes and plying of trucks loaded with heavy iron material on the road not only cause great inconvenience to the commuters but also poses a threat to their lives. Trucks loaded with iron often overturn due to the potholes.  Harpreet Singh Prince, president of the Mandi Gobindgarh Municipal Council said earlier there was a toll plaza on the road, but the contractor shut it and left the road at the mercy of the authorities. Since then, neither the municipal councils nor the government initiated the repair work of the road, he said.  During the Assembly elections, the sitting AAP MLA had promised that it would be his priority to get the road repaired if his party came to power.

(WIAT) — On Wednesday, UAB honored trauma survivors, their families and the doctors that treated them.  Wil Raines is a survivor who said he’s alive today and able to live out his dream of being a father because of the care from trauma specialists at UAB.  Raines is a familiar face here at CBS 42. As a photojournalist, he is an integral part of our team, capturing the heart of stories through the camera lens but it’s his heart that’s taking center stage.  Raines is a car accident survivor and thanks to doctors at UAB’s Trauma Center, he is able to share his story of survival.  “Going across four lanes of traffic changed the rest of my life,” Raines said.  It was the day after Christmas, 1997 when young Raines’ life flashed before his eyes.  “People at the Chevron said ‘Man, there was a bag that went flying out that car.’ [In reality] that was me,” Raines said.  He had hopped in his friend’s Bronco. They were meeting friends at the gas station down the street when they got in a car accident.  “I always wear my seatbelt. But you know, you jump in the car and run across the street, run a mile down the street go see a friend. You don’t think about it. I didn’t think about it,” Raines said.  A car crashed into them causing the Bronco to flip three times throwing Raines out of the car.  “Everything turned white, and it was completely quiet. Growing up as a person of faith I knew exactly what it was. I wasn’t scared,” Raines said.  The crash happened in Prattville, miles from UAB’s Trauma Center. He had a broken arm, collapsed lung and a stage-five laceration on his liver, causing him to bleed out.  “I saw my mom and my dad and the last thing I said to them for a few weeks was pray for me,” Raines said.  His family doctor, Dr. Charles Cloutier knew Raines’ chances of survival were running out. It was a cold, rainy December night and Cloutier said the medivac was grounded because of the weather. He pulled some strings and got an ambulance from Prattville to take Raines to Birmingham. He rode with him the entire way giving him blood and fluids along the way.  “We got him to UAB about 4 a.m. and UAB took over. They were professional, excellent. We felt very comfortable with Wil being here at UAB. It’s a time that’s embedded in your brain and will not go away. It was a traumatic event for everyone involved.

On Friday, May 12, 30-year-old Scotty Hogg and his girlfriend 34-year-old Kaitlyn Brann were climbing Goodro’s Wall in Big Cottonwood Canyon when a large rock on the route gave way, causing both the climbers to fall. Brann was killed in the accident, and Hogg was transported to the hospital by helicopter with serious injuries.  The fundraiser was organized by Cory Lamkins, a friend of Hogg’s. Lamkins and Hogg met in 2017 while they were stationed in Iraq serving in the Army. Lamkins described Hogg as an avid outdoor enthusiast and a very dependable friend.  “He loves being outdoors and in nature,” Lamkins said. “If you call and you need something, he will help whether it’s in person or whether he spends all his days calling anybody he knows that can help you out closer to you. He’s always a guy that if you need him, he’s there.”  Although Lamkins had not met Brann in person, he said that he had spoken to her on the phone several times during calls with Hogg.  “I did not get to meet her in person, sadly, but I will say anybody that had the energy to love Scott must have been a pretty incredible person, because he’s all go all the time,” Lamkins said.  Hogg is still in the hospital where he is working with physical therapists to regain mobility after the accident.  “He’s got a long road ahead of him to fully recover,” Lamkins said. “Just like anybody who lost someone days ago, you know, he’s mentally going through your grinder, but all the love and support it’s really been helping him stay out of dark times.”  At the time of this article $9,030 had been donated out of the GoFundMe’s $20,000 goal. According to Lamkins, all donated funds that surpass the $20,000 goal will be donated to Brann’s family to help cover funeral expenses.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vdG93bmxpZnQuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvZnJpZW5kLW9mLW1hbi1pbmp1cmVkLWluLWNsaW1iaW5nLWFjY2lkZW50LWNyZWF0ZXMtZ29mdW5kbWUtdG8tY292ZXItbWVkaWNhbC1leHBlbnNlcy_SAXdodHRwczovL3Rvd25saWZ0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1L2ZyaWVuZC1vZi1tYW4taW5qdXJlZC1pbi1jbGltYmluZy1hY2NpZGVudC1jcmVhdGVzLWdvZnVuZG1lLXRvLWNvdmVyLW1lZGljYWwtZXhwZW5zZXMvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"accident","2019-12-05","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 13:05:48","Death Benefits Wrongfully Denied to Woman Whose Fiancé Died in Industrial Accident  A woman whose fiancé and father of her children died in an industrial accident was wrongfully denied death benefits solely because she was not his spouse, the Supreme Court of Ohio ruled today.  In a unanimous per curiam opinion, the Supreme Court ruled the Ohio Industrial Commission did not completely analyze the death benefits law, but instead focused only on whether Amanda Carpenter was Christopher McDonald’s wife. An unmarried person in a relationship with the deceased is not “presumed” to be entitled to death benefits under the law, but a case-by-case inquiry needs to be made under such circumstances.  The Court vacated the industrial commission’s order and directed it to determine if Carpenter is entitled to death benefits as a “member of McDonald’s family.”  Click to Expand  Benefit Denial Contested  In 2019, McDonald died in a ditch collapse. Carpenter, the mother of McDonald’s two minor children, applied to the Bureau of Workers’ Compensation for death benefits on behalf of the children and herself.  Carpenter identified herself as McDonald’s fiancée. She provided a sworn statement that she and McDonald had been in a relationship for 11 years and jointly owned property. The two were jointly responsible for mortgage and vehicle lease payments and credit card debts. Each had life insurance policies naming the other as the sole beneficiary. Carpenter indicated she worked part-time, and McDonald was the primary financial support for her and their two children. She added that they “had every intention of being married if not for this accident.”  A district hearing officer awarded benefits to the children, but not to Carpenter. She appealed and a staff hearing officer awarded her death benefits as well. The order was then appealed to the industrial commission, which vacated the decision of its staff hearing officer and denied Carpenter death benefits.  The commission determined Carpenter was not dependent on McDonald as a surviving spouse because they were never married and they could not be considered married under common law because Ohio abolished common-law marriage in 1991. The commission also stated that case law has not extended the benefit to “an unmarried person in a relationship” with the deceased, as Carpenter suggested.  Carpenter requested a writ of mandamus from the Tenth District Court of Appeals ordering the industrial commission to reverse its decision and award her death benefits. The Tenth District did so, and the industrial commission appealed the decision to the Supreme Court.  Supreme Court Analyzed Death Benefit Law  Payment of death benefits to the dependents of a worker who died on the job is governed by R.C. 4123.59(D), the opinion explained. The law explains that a surviving spouse living with the employee at the time of death is presumed to be wholly dependent on the deceased and entitled to death benefits.  The law says a “member of the family” may be a “prospective dependent” if the person also “bears to the deceased employee the relation of surviving spouse, lineal descendant, ancestor, or brother or sister.” The industrial commission may take any facts into consideration that indicate the person’s prospective dependency.  In all other cases, the commission must decide “in accordance with the facts in each particular case” if the person is “a member of the family of the deceased employee, or bears to the deceased employee the relation of surviving spouse, lineal descendant, ancestor, or brother or sister.”  The Court stated this last paragraph of the law applies to claims brought by a person not presumed to be a dependent of the employee, and may even apply to a surviving spouse if the spouse was not living with the employee at the time of death.  The opinion stated that the last paragraph of R.C. 4123.59(D) provides two potential categories of dependents. One is a member of the family of the deceased employee. The second is a person who “bears to the deceased employee the relation of surviving spouse, lineal descendant, ancestor, or brother or sister.” Because the sentence contains an “or,” a person does not have to be married to the deceased employee to be a member of the family, the Court ruled.  The law indicates “any” person may be eligible for benefits if that person is determined to be “a member of the family,” the opinion stated. Ohio workers’ compensation laws do not define “member of the family.” When denying Carpenter benefits, the commission did not consider or determine whether she was a member of McDonald’s family, the opinion stated.  The commission argued that for more than 80 years, the law in Ohio required a legal marriage before it was required to pay death benefits. The opinion noted the commission used cases from 1922 and 1957 to support its argument.  The Court pointed to more recent cases in which stepchildren who were not formally adopted, but lived with and were dependent on the deceased employee, were considered members of the family and were awarded death benefits.  The opinion stated the commission could consider that an unmarried person in a relationship with the deceased is a member of the family. The Court pointed to definitions in Black’s Law Dictionary that could include Carpenter. For instance, one definition of “family” in the law dictionary is “a group consisting of parents and their children,” the opinion noted. Another is “a group of people who live together and usu[ally] have a shared commitment to a domestic relationship.”  “Accordingly — as these definitions show — it is very well possible that Carpenter could qualify as a ‘member of the family of the deceased employee,’” the Court concluded. “Whether Carpenter actually qualifies as a ‘member of the family of the deceased employee’ under the particular facts of this case is a question that the commission will have to address.”  2022-0143.

Manoli's chef and owner, Manoli Katsaneva, shared the story on what shuttered his restaurant since December because of an accident in the business upstairs. He said a quarter-inch pipe came undone from a water cooler, letting out gallons of water for hours overnight.  ""It was just raining through the ceiling,"" he explained, ""there was water going through all of the drywall, all over the floor, the equipment, the floors, the tables. Then it went through our basement level, so it just completely kind of destroyed the entire restaurant.""  Katsanevas says damage costs have already topped $200,000 with the possibility of more to come. Without insurance, he doesn't know if his Manoli's would have recovered. And the damage couldn't have come at a worse time as the restaurant had just been nominated for a prestigious hospitality award.  ""We got nominated for James Beard [Award] which is amazing, it's like the Oscar for restaurants and obviously we were elated to have it; it would've been awesome if we were open when we had it because I'm sure it would've boosted our business,"" Katsanevas said.  Manoli's was also expecting to be the food destination during NBA All-Star Weekend. When that all came to a halt, Manoli's still found a way to make some things happen during the closure.  ""We were already contracted out by the NBA, so because of that we rented out a commissary kitchen and we still catered for three days straight, 8 hours a day over at the Hyatt for all the NBA All-Stars,"" the owner said.  On Tuesday, Manoli's was finally able to open its doors and allow customers to smell and taste what the owner himself describes as modern Greek food.  ""We're only a 50-seat restaurant. We did over 100 covers last night and they were all regulars that have been coming here for the eight years we've been open,"" Katsanevas said. ""It was just so cool to be able to see everyone again and hug everyone and say hi. It was probably one of the coolest services we ever worked.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDEzbm93LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvYmVsb3ZlZC1zYWx0LWxha2UtY2l0eS1yZXN0YXVyYW50LXJlb3BlbnMtYWZ0ZXItZGlzYXN0cm91cy1hY2NpZGVudNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

SPRINGFIELD GARDENS, Queens (WABC) -- A 14-year-old girl was killed after being ejected from a car as it slammed into the back of a parked UPS truck in Queens.  Police are investigating why a 16-year-old boy was behind the wheel with another minor. The NYPD says he was driving with a Learner's Permit and speeding.  ""As a mother, a mother don't want to go through this. I found her bracelet I can't sleep. I come to get her. I come to get my daughter,"" said Keisha Francis, the victim's mother.  Francis searched desperately through the broken glass Thursday morning for something, anything that would remind her of her 14-year-old daughter, Fortune Williams.  A bracelet was all that was left after the deadly crash.  ""I have three children and she showed me more love than anything else. At night I have to cuddle with Fortune, I couldn't sleep last night. I can't live without my daughter,"" Francis said.  Fortune was a passenger in the red BMW. Eyewitness News has obtained video but stopped it before it shows the car barreling into the back of a parked UPS truck.  The impact knocked the delivery driver to the ground.  ""The car was coming basically maybe 90-100 mph,"" a witness said.  An eyewitness says the 16-year-old driver of the BMW was tailing a tractor-trailer on North Conduit Avenue Wednesday around 6:45 p.m. when he tried to switch lanes and lost control.  Police, who set up a speed trap a day later, say the teen driver was going at high rate of speed.  The driver survived but Fortune was thrown from the BMW upon impact. She was a student at Springfield Gardens high school and interested in the medical field.  Her life was cut far too short, leaving her mother forever with a void.  ""My life will never be the same without Fortune. Fortune is a sweetheart. She's a loving, caring child,"" Francis said.  Her mother says she was working a double shift the night of this tragedy. Fortune was home with her older sister, but went outside to hang out in her friend's car. Sadly, she never came home.  The 16-year-old driver of the car was taken to Cohen Children's Medical Center where he is stable.

"accident","2023-04-28","Not Discerned","{""FollyBeach"", ""SouthCarolina"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 21:24:03","The widower groom of the newlywed killed by an alleged drunk driver on Folly Beach April 28 has filed a wrongful death civil lawsuit. It claims the driver, Jamie Komoroski of James Island, had been “bar hopping” throughout the fateful day.  Charleston-based attorney Daniel Dalton of Mickelsen Dalton LLC is representing Aric Hutchinson, the groom who received multiple injuries in the golf cart-car accident that made national headlines.  Dalton  “This case is about keeping the public safe from drunk driving,” he said. “We’ve performed our own investigation into this matter. We’ve been cooperating with law enforcement however we can, and we felt confident enough to be ready to file the lawsuit based on what we’ve found out so far.”  The lawsuit follows a tragic accident in which the alleged drunk driver’s car collided with a golf cart transporting newlywed bride Samantha Miller and groom Hutchinson, as well as two others. The bride and groom had gotten married only hours earlier.  According to a news report, a lab report from the State Law Enforcement Division showed Komoroski had a blood-alcohol level of 0.26 at the time, more than three times over the legal limit.  Hutchinson is still physically recovering from injuries sustained in the crash, Dalton said. According to news reports, data retrieved from Komoroski’s rental car showed she was driving 65 mph, well over twice the speed limit.  Dalton said there are still facts and a lot of questions that hadn’t yet been answered.  “There are still many details we don’t know about the sequence of events leading up to the tragic crash,” Dalton said. “But by filing a lawsuit, we can begin the legal discovery process that allows us to get the answers that Samantha’s family deserves.”  According to the lawsuit, “Despite being noticeably and visibly intoxicated at each of these establishments, Jamie Komoroski continued to be served, provided, and/or allowed to consume alcohol in each of them.”  Dalton said video and photo evidence, as well as eyewitness testimony, were used in the investigation to ensure confidence in Komoroski’s level of intoxication described in the lawsuit.  Businesses named in the lawsuit were Beach Front Bars, Snapper Jacks, The Folly Beach Deli, The Drop In Bar & Deli, The Crab Shack, Folly Tacqueria, Taco Boy, El Gallo Bar and Grill, and Bottle Cap Management Group.  According to the lawsuit, these establishments “ … as licensed sellers of beer, wine and liquor for consumption pursuant to South Carolina law, had a duty to obey all laws and regulations regarding the sale of alcoholic beverages and exercise due care … not to allow patrons to become intoxicated, to not serve alcohol to intoxicated persons.”  The lawsuit also lists about 20 John and Jane Does representing owners, managers, operators, agents and more whose “negligence contributed to” Miller’s death.  The private investigation is ongoing, he said.  “We hope that the bars will cooperate with us and provide whatever they have,” Dalton said. “I would think given the tragic nature of this case that they would want to own up to whatever happened or didn’t happen … we’ve seen cooperation from some parties; others are tightening up a little bit.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vY2hhcmxlc3RvbmNpdHlwYXBlci5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8xNy93aWRvd2VyLW9mLWJyaWRlLWtpbGxlZC1pbi1mb2xseS1iZWFjaC1hY2NpZGVudC1maWxlcy1sYXdzdWl0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Uğur Karahanlı’s father and mother died shortly before first responders arrived on the scene, while his wife was seriously injured in the accident.  According to local reports, Karahanlı, a former teacher who was dismissed by a government decree as part of purges that followed a July 15, 2016 coup attempt, was in 2021 sentenced to six-and-a-half years in prison on conviction of alleged links to the movement.  Karahanlı had previously been jailed in a prison in southern Hatay province, one of the areas hardest hit by two powerful earthquakes in early February, after which he was transferred to the prison in central Turkey.  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has been targeting followers of the Gülen movement, inspired by Turkish Muslim cleric Fethullah Gülen, since the corruption investigations of December 17-25, 2013, which implicated then-prime minister Erdoğan, his family members and his inner circle.  Dismissing the investigations as a Gülenist coup and conspiracy against his government, Erdoğan designated the movement as a terrorist organization and began to target its members. He intensified the crackdown on the movement after the abortive putsch in 2016, which he accused Gülen of masterminding. Gülen and the movement strongly deny involvement in the coup attempt or any terrorist activity.  Following the failed coup, the Turkish government declared a state of emergency and carried out a massive purge of state institutions under the pretext of an anti-coup fight.  More than 130,000 public servants, including 4,156 judges and prosecutors, as well as 24,706 members of the armed forces were summarily removed from their jobs for alleged membership in or relationships with “terrorist organizations” by emergency decree-laws subject to neither judicial nor parliamentary scrutiny.  Former public servants were not only fired from their jobs; they were also banned from working again in the public sector and getting a passport. The government also made it difficult for them to work formally in the private sector. Notes were put on the social security database about dismissed public servants to deter potential employers, leading them to work in unskilled jobs with little workplace safety.

"accident","2023-05-09","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 22:02:58","Flowers are placed on a walkway near where the raft capsized, in Minakami, Gunma Prefecture, on May 9, 2023. (Mainichi/Ryutaro Nishimoto)  MAEBASHI -- The parents of a 19-year-old university student who died in a recent rafting accident on the Tone River in Gunma Prefecture are seeking answers after he was found without a life jacket, and it emerged a guide on another boat had said the student's raft would capsize.  The victim, Keisuke Honda, had only just entered a national university in Tokyo, and on the day of the accident, he left his family home early in the morning. ""I had no idea that he was going rafting,"" his mother said. His father added, ""I thought he was going on a day trip with friends and that he would come back as normal.""  At around 6:45 p.m. on May 5, the parents received a call from Gunma Prefecture Police's Numata Police Station, informing them of the accident. They went by car to Gunma, arriving at about 9 p.m. It was dark and they couldn't see any rescue boats out.  ""Is no one looking for our son?"" they wondered in shock. The parents took out a flashlight they had bought on the way and made their way through the grass at the side of the river.  ""I thought that if he was in water as cold as this, I wanted to rescue him quickly,"" the father said. Multiple cuts ran up his arms, apparently made by the grass.  Son found with no life jacket  The teen's parents spent seven hours searching a roughly 1 kilometer stretch of the river starting from the accident site, but didn't find anything. Police resumed their search at 5 a.m. on May 6, and at 5:49 a.m. they found him about 300 meters downstream from the Suwakyo Bridge over the Tone River. The cause of death was drowning. He was not wearing a life jacket.  The parents met with officials from the rafting tour company at Numata Police Station on May 6, and spoke with them for about an hour. They asked about the situation at the time their son's raft capsized and about rescue efforts immediately afterward, but said they didn't receive a concrete explanation. ""They didn't tell us anything,"" the student's father recalled angrily.  Their distrust grew after they heard about conditions at the time of the accident from a man in another rafting boat, who took part in the same tour.  According to the man, the participants were in three boats, with two full of families with children, and a blue one carrying Honda and his friends. The man said that when he got into his boat, the guide said, ""That blue boat is going to capsize."" The other boats passed the accident site safely and then waited for the blue boat, and again the guide said that Honda's boat would capsize.  After the accident, the other two rafts were taken to the side of the river and the tour ended partway through. Participants were reportedly handed commemorative photos at this point, taken by a photographer who was following the boats in a vehicle along the river. The man said he wanted Honda's parents to know the river conditions at the time, and handed his photos to them, and also told them about what he saw.  Rocks and driftwood are seen scattered about at the scene of the accident as water splashes up, on the Tone River in Minakami, Gunma Prefecture, on May 9, 2023. (Mainichi/Ryutaro Nishimoto)  The photos showed Honda wearing a life jacket and a helmet, shoulder to shoulder with his friends, and showed him laughing as water splashed above the raft.  His mother said, ""It was a dangerous activity. He was suddenly thrown out into water chilly with snowmelt, and his life jacket was carried downstream, so he must have sunk into the water around where the boat capsized. The tour guide's rescue effort wasn't enough at all. I want the police to conduct a proper investigation.""  Operating company: 'A turn of events we can't take back'  The president of the company that organized the tour commented, ""I'm truly sorry that there has been a turn of events we can't take back. We will consider efforts to prevent a recurrence and think about how to atone for this.""  According to the president, participants sign consent forms acknowledging that if they fall out of the boat and stand up the current, their legs could get pinned against rocks and they could suffer broken bones or even drown. Verbal explanations were also given to make people aware of the risks.  On the possibility of a boat capsizing, the company president said, there were times when people played balancing games, standing on the edge of the boat and that the boats would sometimes capsize as a result. But people don't do that in the current season when there is a lot of water in the river and the temperature is cold.  Regarding the comment from the passenger on the other boat that their guide had said that the blue boat would capsize, the president said, ""When two boats have gone ahead and are waiting, we sometimes humorously explain that we will help the other one in such and such a way if they capsize.""  According to Outdoor Joint Association Minakami, an organization of Gunma Prefecture-based rafting companies, safety checks are conducted along the Tone River five times a year, and if tour guides find anything abnormal, they are required to quickly report it to the association. Each operator is also certified in whitewater rescue and first aid. Association director Mitsuyoshi Ishikawa commented, ""If something happens, we respond quickly. We've established fairly strict safety standards.""  A total of four people died in Tone River rafting accidents in Gunma Prefecture between 2000 and 2002 -- two male and one female passenger in their 20s and 30s and one male guide in his 20s.  Water safety group chairman: 'Wear your life jacket properly'  Hidetoshi Saito, chairman of the Society of Water Rescue and Survival Research and a graduate school professor at the Nagaoka University of Technology in Niigata Prefecture, commented, ""People need to be aware that boats can sink or capsize. That's not to say that we shouldn't get into them; rather I want people to wear life jackets properly so they can enjoy the ride.""  In the event of an accident such as a boat capsizing, it is important to float on the water to ensure one can breathe. According to Saito, life jackets can come off easily if only the zipper is closed, so the belt and buckle need to be fastened tighter than people might expect. He says that if the belt and buckle hadn't come undone, then the student may have slipped out of the life jacket, but if there were undone, then there is a possibility he either wasn't wearing it properly or had undone it himself before drowning. ""If he wasn't wearing it properly from the start then the operator would be held responsible,"" he said.

Credit: JavierLJ/Shutterstock.com.  Chinese mining company Zijin Mining has reported a mining accident at one of its mines in Tibet, the circumstances of which have led to the stopping of production.  On 14 May, a lift cage fell during shaft construction in the drainage system at the Julong open-pit copper and polymetallic mine, cutting contact with six workers.  Zijin has suspended mining production at the site and launched search and rescue operations for the missing workers.  The company added that it has carried out an investigation and rectification of the hidden risks. The cause of the accident is still being investigated.  The construction of the Julong mine was subcontracted to Fujian Xingwanxiang Construction Group by Zijin subsidiary Tibet Julong Copper.  Zijin owns a 50.1% stake in the Julong mine, which produced 115,000 tonnes (t) of copper last year and is planning to increase its production to 152,000t this year.  Phase one production at Julong Copper began in December 2021. Located in the Tibetan plateau at an altitude between 4,000m and 5,000m, the mine features 10.7 million tonnes of copper and 570,000t of molybdenum.  Last month, the company through Barrick Gold, a joint venture with Barrick Niugini (BNL), entered a New Porgera Progress Agreement (NPPA) with the Papua New Guinea Government.  According to the NPPA, all three parties – Zijin, BNL and the Papua New Guinea Government – have agreed to reopen the Porgera Gold Mine at the earliest opportunity.  Operations at the mine were suspended in April 2020 due to the failure to secure approval for its extension.

Whether you decide to get advice from youraccidentattorneys.com, or research to find a suitable attorney, make sure you are getting assistance from a qualified professional. When you are represented by a qualified attorney, you will be able to rest assured that your claim is in capable hands and that your rights are being appropriately protected.  Types of Damages You Can Seek in a Car Accident Case  In car accident cases, the types of damages that can be sought can vary greatly depending on the circumstances of the incident. The most common types of damages that plaintiffs may seek include compensation for medical expenses, lost wages, property damage, and pain and suffering.  However, there are other damages that may also be applicable, such as punitive damages, which are intended to punish a defendant for particularly egregious behavior. It is important to work with an experienced attorney who can guide you through the legal process and help you pursue the appropriate damages for your case. Don’t hesitate to seek legal advice if you’ve been involved in a car accident and believe you deserve compensation for any losses or injuries suffered.  Proving Fault in a Car Accident Case  When it comes to car accident cases, proving fault can be a complex process that often ends up in court. Legal professionals and insurance companies will examine a variety of factors, including police reports, witness statements, and medical evidence to determine who is at fault for the accident. It is important to remember that proving fault is not simply about assigning blame, but rather about providing justice and ensuring that the responsible party is held accountable for their actions. Therefore, if you are involved in a car accident, it is crucial to seek legal representation to ensure that your rights are upheld and the responsible party is brought to justice.  Common Defense Strategies Used in Car Accident Cases  When it comes to car accident cases, common defense strategies are often employed in an effort to minimize or eliminate liability. One such strategy involves arguing that the plaintiff was partially or completely at fault for the accident. Another common defense tactic is to challenge the plaintiff’s claims of injury or damages, often by questioning the severity of the injuries or the validity of the medical treatment received. Moreover, defendants may attempt to settle the case for a smaller amount by arguing that the plaintiff had pre-existing injuries or conditions that were aggravated by the accident. It is important to work with an experienced attorney who can help navigate these defense strategies and fight for your rights in court.  Timeline of the Legal Process for a Car Accident Case  When you’ve been in a car accident, the legal process can seem daunting and complicated. However, it’s important to understand the timeline of events that will unfold. The process typically begins with filing a claim with your insurance company, followed by an investigation into the accident and determining who is at fault.  From there, negotiations may take place to reach a settlement. If a settlement cannot be reached, the case will proceed to court where a judge or jury will ultimately determine the outcome. It’s important to have a knowledgeable and experienced legal team on your side to guide you through each step of the process and ensure that your rights are protected.  The legal process of a car accident case can be a painstaking one requiring effort from all parties involved in order to satisfactorily resolve the dispute. It is vital for those who are involved in an accident to understand their rights and the steps they can take toward seeking the damages they deserve. Knowing who is at fault for an accident, what types of damages you can recover, and having a timeline for the progression of your case will help ensure that proceedings move quickly and efficiently. With this knowledge in hand, each party can work together to ensure a swift resolution in their car accident case.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vc2ZsY24uY29tL3RoZS1sZWdhbC1wcm9jZXNzLW9mLWEtY2FyLWFjY2lkZW50LWNhc2Utd2hhdC15b3UtbmVlZC10by1rbm93L9IBUWh0dHBzOi8vc2ZsY24uY29tL3RoZS1sZWdhbC1wcm9jZXNzLW9mLWEtY2FyLWFjY2lkZW50LWNhc2Utd2hhdC15b3UtbmVlZC10by1rbm93Lw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Warren,29, was walking along the junction of Trinity Church Road and North Shore Road between 2 am and 3:15 am when he was struck by a car.  His death took Bermuda’s road fatality toll for 2023 to five.  In a social media post, the Bermuda Football Association (BFA) said it “joins the Warren and Bermuda football family in mourning the loss of a rising icon of the beautiful game, Marco Warren, who had his debut international cap for Bermuda in March 2015 against Nicaragua. The match resulted in a 2-0 victory for our Gombey Warriors.  “BFA extends its heartfelt condolences to Marco’s family, friends, teammates, and fans. Our logo will be displayed in black until Marco’s funeral”.  Warren’s club, the PHC Zebras, also paid tribute to him saying they will never forget the impact that their star player had on the team and Bermuda.  “Marco was more than just a player. He was a part of our family, embodied the Zebra spirit, and was the heart of our team. Marco continually left fans in awe of his skills and inspired other players to improve. He was a humble person despite his level of greatness. When he was on the field, the “magician” just went to work,” the club said.  “Marco was a loving father, son, brother, boyfriend, nephew, cousin, teammate, and true friend. He was a leader both on and off the field as he demonstrated the well-rounded individual we aspire to develop for our community. All who encountered him were impressed with his wisdom and kindness.”  Bermudian star and Bristol City player Nahki Wells also remembered his teammate on Instagram.

"accident","2023-05-11","Not Discerned","{""Edmonton"", ""Alberta"", ""Canada""}","Tue 16 May 2023 20:18:31","Over 160 Edmonton pedestrians are injured in car accidents every year. Nearly five of those collisions turn out fatal. These kinds of accidents can lead to life-changing disabilities and catastrophic financial losses. You might lose work hours, incur thousands of medical bills, and experience severe trauma. If you or a loved one has been injured in an accident, consult Edmonton pedestrian accident lawyers who can help you overcome all three challenges. However, you can take a few steps at the accident spot to solidify your legal claim.  1) Call for Medical Assistance  Your health is the most important consideration after a collision. Severe injuries don’t always make themselves known straight away. Shock can mask pain, so getting an assessment from a qualified healthcare provider is crucial. That said, this is when the evidence is at its best, so contact local law enforcement as soon as you’ve called for medical assistance. If your injuries are too severe to gather photographs and numbers, police presence at the scene will bolster your case.  An emergency room assessment is one of the most powerful things you can do to prove your damages. The sooner you see a doctor, the more convincing your evidence will be. Remember that personal injury cases draw more compensation when there’s solid diagnostic evidence, so X-rays and the like are key.  2) Gather Contact Information  Eyewitnesses disperse quickly. If your injuries aren’t life-threatening, exchanging information with everyone involved in the collision is essential. If there are eyewitnesses in sight, gather their contact details as well. You should also collect the insurance details of the at-fault party. While the police will gather their evidence, you should also take your photographs. If you see skid marks, car dents, or any other forms of damage, assume that an expert could use them to prove the cause of the accident. Make sure you snap the scene from different angles. You can’t take too many photographs, but you can certainly take too few.  3) Don’t Admit Guilt  Admitting guilt to eyewitnesses and at-fault parties can weaken your case, so avoid any comments that could be interpreted this way. Don’t apologize or express a sense of guilt. It’s also best to keep the experience off of social media. Tweets and blog posts can be used against you in court. It’s best to limit your communication to the absolute minimum lest you accidentally harm your chances in a personal injury trial.  4) Make Sure the Police Take Your Statement  Almost 40% of police reports don’t include a statement from the pedestrian, particularly if they’re sent to urgent care. The police must record your version of events. Your voice matters, so don’t be afraid to question the police report. This paperwork can be amended to reflect the situation more accurately. Call a lawyer if the officer refuses to take your statement or fix inaccuracies.  5) Start Making an Insurance Claim  Once you’ve dealt with the urgent aspects of your collision, it’s time to phone the driver’s insurance company to launch a claim. It’s best to limit your narrative to the essential facts, no matter how much they pressure you into providing more details. You’re not required to disclose facts about your medical care, police report, or partial fault.  6) Keep Track of Follow-Up Care  The more detailed your medical care is, the stronger your case will be, so go to all your recommended follow-up appointments. Request diagnostics if necessary. Keep an ongoing record of your medical bills and transportation costs. If you miss time off work, add your lost income to your records. These details will ultimately go to an insurer, but it’s best to seek legal advice before you hand them over.  Personal injury settlements can be difficult to secure without legal help. Insurers and at-fault parties are notorious for low-balling victims, but you can build a successful case with the right assistance. You need someone in your corner, no matter how strong or resourceful you are.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vdml2YWdsYW1tYWdhemluZS5jb20vaW5qdXJlZC1pbi1hLXBlZGVzdHJpYW4tYWNjaWRlbnQtNi1pbW1lZGlhdGUtc3RlcHMteW91LXNob3VsZG50LW1pc3Mv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

State police said the bear was crossing the southbound lanes of I-85 about two miles north of the DeWitt exit when the driver of a sports-utility vehicle slammed on the brakes to avoid hitting it. Another SUV, however, was not so fortunate and wound up hitting both the bear and the back of the first SUV.  No one inside either vehicle was injured. Witnesses told state police the bear ran away from the scene.  Earlier Monday, Petersburg Police reported a bear sighting near the Henry William Townhouses at the intersection of Lee Avenue and South Street. Authorities were encouraging anyone who may see the bear not to approach it and instead call police at (804) 732-4222 or the Virginia Department of Games and Inland Fisheries at (804) 367-1000.  A Petersburg Police spokesperson told The Progress-Index no other sightings were reported in the city.  Black bears are a common sight anywhere in Virginia, according to the state Department of Wildlife Resources. While seen sporadically along the coast, a DWF map indicates these animals can be found most anywhere in the state because they adapt so easily to their surroundings.  “They prefer habitats that provide cover, such as a densely wooded mature oak forests or swampy area in the coastal plain, and easily accessible food resources,” the DWF website said.  The National Park Service says black bears are far less aggressive than brown or any other type of bear and will usually avoid human contact. However, authorities remind people that despite their temperment, black bears still are wild animals and could attack if provoked. Therefore, it is wise to let a black bear alone should you see one.

So famous, it actually got a revamp for the likes of Vanguard and Modern Warfare 2 (where it was set on a ship).  Its somewhat simple design, which sees a collection of vacant containers for players to shoot their way around, is a mainstay of the series. However, the original map nearly didn't make its way into Call of Duty at all. As hard as it is to imagine now, Shipment's inclusion in 2007's Modern Warfare was ""truly an accident"".  Watch on YouTube Here is Shipment in 2022's Modern Warfare 2.  Speaking to Dexerto, Infinity Ward multiplayer design director Geoff Smith shared more backstory on Shipment's genesis.  ""There's little happy experiments. Things that worked out, things that didn't work out for whatever reason,"" Smith said, before admitting Shipment is the ""bane of his existence"".  Smith stated the map was originally conceived with split-screen in mind, and the team at Infinity Ward used Shipment for internal tests. It was then included in the broader ""playlist script"" for Modern Warfare, but the developer ""forgot"" to remove it before the game's final release.  After that, there was ""no going back,"" Smith recalled.  It is hard to imagine Call of Duty without Shipment. Even those with only a vague familiarity with the series can often name it as one of the franchise's maps. While it may have been included by accident, at least the end result was a happy one.  After all, we are now 16 years on from its first iteration, and here I am still writing about it.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cm9nYW1lci5uZXQvY2FsbC1vZi1kdXR5LTRzLWljb25pYy1zaGlwbWVudC1tYXAtaW5jbHVkZWQtYnktYWNjaWRlbnQtZGV2ZWxvcGVyLWZvcmdvdC10by1yZW1vdmUtaXTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Share Copy Link Copy  Hide Transcript Show Transcript  Leo played it perfect tone which was, he's shivering. He could barely form the words, he knows he's gonna die. We've already seen that. He's made *** sacrifice for her. Of course, very controversial. You know, that he could have gotten on the, on the, the, the raft with her, but he saw that it would have compromised her safety and he kind of steps back. He did what the gentleman on the ship did. I was happy when I wrote that scene, I'll be back, I'll be back. So that, that's *** funny thing because in the script, it, it actually read, I think I'll come back and there was something about the way Arnold said it with his then quite thick Austrian accent. That didn't sound quite right. And so I said, well, just switch it to, I'll be back, you know, and he said, really? I said, yeah, and we just kind of, you know, made it up, made it up in the moment and of course, it became quite iconic. But here's the interesting thing about that line. You're watching the movie for the first time, you have no idea what's gonna happen next. And yet it still got *** laugh somehow people had gotten already. This guy was this bulldozer. You just get this innate sense of this guy as just this juggernaut. And when he says I'll be back, it's gonna be bad. So people laughed before they even knew they didn't even know what *** Terminator movie was at that point. Well, I think they were starting to figure it out. Come with me if you want to live. Terminator Two. That's the pivotal moment where Sarah has this stunning realization that the Terminator that's before her, her worst nightmare has turned into her savior and the savior of her son. And it was just *** fun moment to see how Linda would play that. We knew it was *** tough moment for her because her whole reality literally flips upside down. She played it beautifully. It's just *** nice piece of acting chicken. Oh, it's *** pure moment of exultation for him. He's just alive. He's in the moment he doesn't have *** penny in his pocket. He won the damn ticket in *** poker game. He's just living carefree fancy free. He's met Fabrizio and they're just having fun. It was an expression of life, his life spirit, which seems so unquenchable and so full of potential. Every time I'm aching by, I'm getting ready to do *** run. I'm, I'm talking to Leo on the radio. Ok. Howl, like *** wolf. You know, I got him howling like *** wolf. We tried it, you know, I don't know, 10 times and he looked great and his, his acting spirit was there, but we just couldn't quite find the right word and it just popped into my head. I said, just say, I'm the king of the world. I hear back on the lucky what I said, you gotta sell it, you gotta sell it. You know, just say I'm the king of the world and he did and he put his arms out and you feel that spirit and it became the focal point of the whole scene, the whole ship's energy, the pounding of the engines, the dolphins jumping and everything, all, you know, the sort of the beauty and the power and the majesty of it all culminated to his, his spirit at the, at the bow. Now I come along at the Academy Awards and make the classic mistake of assuming that just because we had won best picture or that, that I got be best director that everybody in the room loved the movie and would celebrate *** reference to the movie, but they weren't, not everybody voted for it, right? And the knives are always, they're, they're kind of always half drawn even when they're there to celebrate you. The knife is half out of the, out of the, the hilt. I mean out of the, the sheath, right? Yeah. So I put my foot in that one, Jack. I want you to draw me like one of your French girls, *** lot of people have, have kind of mocked and spoofed that line. But I think *** lot of people really like it. She's bold. She's taking the power. She's been robbed of power by her fiance, by her mother, by her social straitjacket. He's this devil may care, free spirit, artistic spirit, all the things that she wants to be and she just flips the script and tells him to do his thing. I think people celebrate her empowerment as *** character in, in that moment, it's also the promise of romance, the promise of sex. It's also this great liberation and it's my 40 something year old hand as Leo's 20 year old hand. But I do the, the picture and then Leo just made some head scratching, you know, while he was fiercely concentrating on, on her and pretending to draw. The only problem is I draw left handed and he was madly drawn way right handed. I should have made *** draw left handed. When you sketch, there's an arc that's formed by your wrist. So all my lines are arching in this direction. Now, I've got to do the drawing backwards. So if you look in the movie, I'm doing the outlining, but I'm not doing any of the shading. I'm doing the smudging cause I couldn't do it because the arcs were all the wrong, wrong direction. I don't know about you, but I intend to write *** strongly worded letter to the White Star line about all this. I just think people appreciate Jack's presence of mind to be taking the stress out of the situation for her by making *** joke. And Leo played it perfect tone which was, he's shivering. He can barely form the words. He knows he's gonna die. We've already seen that he's made *** sacrifice for her, of course, very controversial. You know, that he could have gotten on the, on the, the, the raft with her, but he saw that it would have compromised her safety and he kind of steps back. He did what the gentleman on the ship did when they stepped back from the life boats to save the women and Children first because that was honor and duty. I was happy when I wrote that scene. Get away from her. You ***. That's *** great uh iconic moment. The moment we knew we had them was then they just burst into wild applause on that line. They loved it. So we knew the movie had had landed. And then you realize this movie is about two females of different species, protecting their young and it's on, it was just the right line at the right time in that movie. And then the audience response to it reminded me why you do this. I was *** marine. Hey, yeah, *** warrior of the jarhead clan. My brother Dave uh was *** marine. He died recently and you go your whole life as *** marine. Jake doesn't matter where he goes in the universe if he was *** US marine at some point, he's *** marine. Only *** marine can call himself *** jarhead unless they're *** marine. In which case it's ok. So that was just *** little inside kind of marine corps reference. I put ***, I put *** few of them in, you know, kind of for my brother Dave who's *** guy that I really loved and admired. I see here, I see you, I see you as *** very important line. It resonates for people *** lot just popped into my head while I was writing the treatment in 95. And it's like, what would *** navy greeting be? You're walking towards somebody and I see you, you know, I basically kind of the simplicity of it, right? And then it started to take on various layers of meaning as I thought, well, what do people really want? They want to be seen? They want to be acknowledged, they want to be recognized, they want to be respected, they wanna be loved seeing it. It took on *** deeper meaning. Jake's kind of struggling with the idea. But of course, the whole movie is about that. The movie starts with him opening his eyes and it ends with him opening, he has woken up to *** greater experience of the world to *** deeper understanding. He's the only human that's ever truly understood the navi from their perspective and he inhabits as his avatar, he inhabits their world. And of course, he's learning from this woman that he's falling in love with. I think you're never more open than when you're falling in love with somebody that can teach you something. And so I see you took on many meanings. You know, I understand you, I acknowledge you, I respect you, I love you. There's the top layer of the movie which is plot and character. And then there's the second layer of the movie, which is thematic, right? Which is about themes of indigenous culture and human civilization, kind of at war with itself, you know, pulling us away from our connection to nature and all those, all those things. But there's another layer, there's *** tertiary layer which is mystical. If we don't service that layer as well, then we're not really doing *** worthy sequel or worthy Sequels to the first film. It continues to be important to ask the audience to see kind of with better eyes, some of the things that are, you know, our problems and our world. I mean, Avatar doesn't pretend to have some great solution. It's just saying, you know, our our our human journey is is very troubled right now. This is our whole, this is our family, this is our fortress. I question it. As I go along spending five years on essentially one ip one, you know, it's, it's 2.5 movies that we've been working on over the last last five years. You know, I question it and then I start seeing the results and then it's *** no brainer at that point. Then it just all comes to life and that world comes to life and you see the characters come to life. It's kind of magical. You know, sometimes I have to pinch myself when I see the end result of the process. So you just have to have faith in the process as you, as you go along. I knew I wanted to tell *** family story. I wanted to as an artist express some of the, the things, the ideas, the feelings that I had as *** parent and that I had observed in my kids and I'd done sort of parent child stories in the past, even all the way back to, to aliens and uh Terminator Two, but I hadn't lived it. There was *** lot of uh sort of great dramatic grist for the mill there uh around the dysfunction of families. But how there's *** strength at the core of families that helps get people through times are all in this highly angst ridden, highly anxious time. Right now. I wanted to within *** fantasy world show, special to *** young audience. It's ok even in even, you know, 200 years from now on *** distant planet, you know, kids are still gonna feel anxious or, or, or depressed or, or unseen, it's ok. You know, I'm just not only channeling my experience as *** parent, but my experience as *** teenager myself. And I just thought that that foundation of universal human experience put into the most far flung fantasy environment that you can imagine grounds it emotionally.

"accident","2019-07-03","00:00:00","{""Perry"", ""Georgia"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 09:00:24","Although it is possible the jury made a mistake when it handed down a guilty verdict, neither Carlson nor Rittenhouse nor Abbott tried to argue the case on the merits. Instead, they made a simple assumption: that any violence against a left-wing protester is justified on its face. Perry had lived out the right-wing fantasy of lethal violence in defense of “order.” By their lights, he had done nothing wrong.  Prominent conservatives have taken the same view of Daniel Penny, the 24-year-old assailant in the killing of Jordan Neely in a New York City subway car this month. What we know is that Neely, who was homeless, was erratic and acting hostile toward other passengers. Witnesses said he had not attacked anyone. At some point, Penny, a former Marine, placed Neely in a chokehold, which killed him. Two other passengers restrained Neely while he struggled on the ground. Penny is now charged with second-degree manslaughter.  We don’t know much, yet, about Penny’s mind-set or motivation during his confrontation on the subway. But this has not stopped conservatives from valorizing him in the same way they valorized Rittenhouse and Perry. “The Marine who stepped in to protect others is a hero,” said Greene, now a congresswoman. The decision to charge Penny, said the Fox News host Greg Gutfeld, was “pro-criminal” and “anti-hero.”  In a testament to conservative enthusiasm for Penny, an online fund-raiser has raised more than $2 million for his legal defense. And DeSantis, now angling for the Republican presidential nomination, stepped in with a message of support. “We must defeat the Soros-Funded DAs, stop the Left’s pro-criminal agenda, and take back the streets for law abiding citizens,” he said on Twitter. “We stand with Good Samaritans like Daniel Penny. Let’s show this Marine … America’s got his back.”  It’s the same language, the same tropes, the same ideas. In listening to conservative fans of Rittenhouse, Perry and Penny, you would never know that there were actual people on the other side of these confrontations. You would never know that those people were, in life, entitled to the protection of the law and that they are, in death, entitled to a full account of the last moments of their lives, with legal responsibility for the men who killed them, if that’s what a jury decides.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTYvb3Bpbmlvbi9uZWVseS1wZW5ueS1wZXJyeS1yaXR0ZW5ob3VzZS1kZXNhbnRpcy5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"accident","2019-07-10","Not Discerned","{""Pittsford"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 21:45:00","PITTSFORD, N.Y. — Braden Shattuck can't quite explain why he was so intent on spending a not-insignificant portion of his childhood hitting 30-yard pitch shots from one side of his family's backyard in the Philadelphia suburbs to the other.  Where some might see monotony, Shattuck saw opportunity. There was something about the feel of that first plastic set of clubs in his hands. Something about the challenge of firing to an imaginary pin. Something about the game that gripped him early and never let go.  ""He was obsessed with (golf),"" Scott Shattuck said of his son. ""We had to almost drag him inside the house.""  So yes, Shattuck always believed there was a chance he'd make it to the sport's biggest stage. Yet the 4-year-old who took delight in tearing up his parents' yard deep into the twilight couldn't have imagined the circuitous route that brought the now-28-year-old to the 2023 PGA Championship.  The 12-footer for par that Shattuck drained to win the PGA Professional Championship in New Mexico last month assured him of a spot in the strongest field of the year starting Thursday at Oak Hill.  It also served as a testament to the relentlessness of a self-professed grinder who was forced to rebuild his swing from the ground up following a car accident in 2019 that resulted in multiple herniated disks in his lower back and made even walking difficult.  The player who would spend 12 hours a day during the summer as a kid pounding ball after ball on the practice range spent the better part of two years watching the guys he competed with on the mini-tour circuit climb the ladder while he went through countless hours of physical therapy and wondered if he'd ever be able to swing something close to pain-free again.  ""Physically you can't even play golf, and mentally it's tough because now what else do you do with your time,"" Shattuck said. ""It took a lot to get over that hurdle.""  So Shattuck poured himself into his work as an assistant golf pro, showing others how to fix their swings while trying to devise a way to tweak his own.  ""It was more of an experiment than anything,"" he said. ""I knew what exactly in my golf swing hurt, so I figured if I could do something with my setup and my golf swing to take some pressure off of those areas, that even if I didn't fully heal that maybe I could still swing a golf club with minimal pain.""  After a two-year sabbatical, his game slowly returned, though not quite the same as before. A more upright stance cost him some distance with his irons, though he has compensated by finding a few more yards with his driver. And the days of planting himself at the range for hours on end are long gone.  The pain is manageable, at least most of the time. He abandoned Korn Ferry Tour qualifying after the first round last fall when his back flared up out of nowhere. His preparation includes a series of stretching exercises and twice-weekly visits to a physical therapist, all of it tinged with just a hint of uncertainty when he wakes up in the morning.  Shattuck is confident his back and his game are in good enough shape to make the cut this weekend. Asking for anything beyond that, at least for now, is just being greedy.  While the vast majority of the 156-man field plays golf for a living, Shattuck remains primarily a teacher. The morning after he got back from his victory in New Mexico — a win that earned Shattuck $60,000, a berth into the PGA and an exemption into six events in the 2024 season — he was back at Rolling Green Golf Club in Springfield, about 15 miles west of downtown Philadelphia.  There were slices to fix. Hooks to solve. A love for the game to impart the way his father did to him as a kid. The younger Shattuck was 14 when he beat his father for the first time, shooting a 67 from the back tees at The Golf Course at Glen Mills while the adults in the group turned to his father with eyebrows raised.  ""Braden would go around (with us) and (they'd) be like, 'Damn, this kid can play,'"" Scott Shattuck said with a laugh.  Sure, his son would prefer to play with a back that doesn't require so much maintenance. Yet the unwanted sabbatical brought on by the car accident also shifted Shattuck's perspective.  ""I had a little bit more of an intense outlook when I was younger,"" he said. ""Now I just feel a lot more fortunate to be out here. I feel like I'm playing with house money so it feels more relaxed.""  At least until he stands on the tee at 7 a.m. on Thursday as part of the first group out on the East Course, a moment that seemed so far away when he was tearing up the backyard as a kid — and even farther during his long recovery following the accident — finally at hand.  Maybe the nerves he fended off during the arduous process of getting here will make a brief appearance. He's not sure.  ""That's a great question,"" he said with a laugh. ""I think we're all going to find out the answer to that one at the same time.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL2tlbm9zaGFuZXdzLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvZm91ci15ZWFycy1hZnRlci1hLWNhcmVlci10aHJlYXRlbmluZy1jYXItYWNjaWRlbnQtc2hhdHR1Y2stcmVhY2hlcy10aGUtcGdhL2FydGljbGVfYzUyZjNiNzktMmQ3OC01NTIwLTllODgtMDdjZDY0NGZmNjQ0Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Duke says that, while stopping to help is appreciated, the safety of the situation should be assessed before stopping.  “Your life has got to be there Safety first before you can save someone else’s life, and so obviously call in locations, vehicles, what they see, if they saw multiple victims, anything,” said Sheriff Duke. “If they can park in that area where they’re safe, where no traffic is going to run over them, then they can get out and help and leave their emergency hazard lights on.”  “They’re not immune to being hit by people driving with their cellphones in their face and they’re just not paying attention, it just happens,” said Sheriff Duke. “But they need to put their emergency hazards on and either get past the accident and get in a safe area they can stop in and come back up on the shoulder of the road just to avoid traffic.”  The incident is still under investigation.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vY2RsbGlmZS5jb20vMjAyMy9zZW1pLXRydWNrLWFjY2lkZW50LXR1cm5zLWZhdGFsLXdoZW4tZ29vZC1zYW1hcml0YW5zLW1ha2UtdW5zYWZlLXN0b3AtdG8taGVscC_SAWtodHRwczovL2NkbGxpZmUuY29tLzIwMjMvc2VtaS10cnVjay1hY2NpZGVudC10dXJucy1mYXRhbC13aGVuLWdvb2Qtc2FtYXJpdGFucy1tYWtlLXVuc2FmZS1zdG9wLXRvLWhlbHAvP2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"accident","2008-07-10","Not Discerned","{""Oshkosh"", ""Wisconsin"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 16:09:00","A plane flies overhead Michael Larsen’s 1954 Cessna 170B at the Oshkosh Seaplane Base. (Photo by Megan Vande Voort)  Seaplane accidents, while few, represent an area of general aviation where targeted training could pay real dividends.  That’s the takeaway from a new seaplane accident analysis report by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association Air Safety Institute (ASI).  Funded in part by the Seaplane Pilots Association, the Seaplane Accident Analysis Report 2008 – 2022 offers a detailed accident analysis, addressing flight conditions, fleet composition, accident causes, NTSB findings, and more.  The report also includes recommendations to reduce the number of accidents, including several training tips.  “Seaplanes are highly capable and uniquely suited for a wide variety of operations, but seaplane flying carries additional risk — due to the environment in which they operate — when not flown safely by proficient seaplane pilots,” says Robert Geske, AOPA Air Safety Institute manager of aviation safety analysis.  During the report period, 2008 to 2022, there were 406 seaplane accidents, with 77 ending in fatalities, he reports.  “For reference, general aviation accidents during the same period averaged 1,200 to 1,500 with 200 ending in a fatality,” he says. “The seaplane fleet makes up less than 5% of all general aviation aircraft, so understanding these types of accidents is valuable to the seaplane community.”  This report is also important as getting data has been increasingly difficult since the FAA began “repressing” seaplane activity data in 2015 “due to unreliable reporting and analysis.”  “For example, few seaplane aircraft operators report their hours. In addition, aircraft that switch out floats for other landing gear — as the season dictates — make reporting more difficult,” it continues.  The limited availability of seaplane flight hours and activity prevents a rate-based analysis of seaplane accidents. It also prevents “a meaningful year-to-year comparison and understanding of whether the rise and fall of accidents is attributed to flight activity or to an actual change,” the report notes.  With all that said, the report finds that one factor dominates the cause of seaplane accidents: Abnormal runway contact (ARC).  “This is best thought of as a landing surface contact since seaplanes do not need to operate from a paved runway surface,” according to the report. “These types of accidents occur mainly during landing (90%), with many resulting from gear-down water landings.”  The report recommends that a “broader adoption and installation of gear warning systems that aid in identifying the landing surface should reduce accidents in this category.”  It also suggests more participation by pilots in the Seaplane Pilots Association’s “Positive rate, gear up” campaign.  Loss of control in flight (LOC-I) is the deadliest cause of seaplane accidents.  “Given seaplanes’ unique operating environment, the maneuvering phase is where most of these accidents occur,” the report notes.  “Dedicated efforts targeted at low-speed awareness, distraction prevention, and positive aircraft control could drive down the frequency of fatal accidents,” it continues. “Seaplane pilots may also benefit from the installation and use of angle of attack indicators.”  It also notes that the installation of gear warning and advisory systems, which work to identify the landing surface and inform pilots of proper surface or water gear configuration, may drastically reduce nose-over events.  “While not as deadly as LOC-I, reducing the volume of accidents would, most likely, positively impact the cost and availability of insurance,” the report states.  The report concludes with a number of recommendations, including additional training, specifically in aircraft control, loss of control prevention, gear configuration, and operations during maneuvering.  One of the big issues with seaplane training are gaps in flying and training, according to the report, which notes that many pilots swap floats for skis or wheels as the seasons change.  “Seaplane pilots may experience six or more months away from seaplane operations, a situation that hinders their proficiency and impacts their training. Pilots who experience gaps due to seasonality need to take added precautions when resuming seaplane operations. Combating these gaps through a training course could help mitigate proficiency-related accidents.”  Another critical area for increased training is in decisionmaking, which was cited by the NTSB as a key contributor to seaplane accidents.  “Safety starts and ends with good decisions,” the report noted. “Reminding pilots of the effect their choices have on the outcome of the flight and helping them understand how to mitigate risks will further reduce all GA accidents.”  You can read the full report at AOPA.org/Training-and-Safety/Air-Safety-Institute/Accident-Analysis/Seaplane-Accident-Report.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vZ2VuZXJhbGF2aWF0aW9ubmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8xNi9yZXBvcnQtdGFrZXMtaW4tZGVwdGgtbG9vay1hdC1zZWFwbGFuZS1hY2NpZGVudHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"accident","2023-06-28","09:30:00","{""HollyHill"", ""Florida"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 23:24:00","Sabrina Michelle Strickland is on trial for shooting and killing her boyfriend, 46-year-old Robert Haskell McWaters.  Strickland was 50 on June 28, 2019, when she shot McWaters at the home they rented at 773 Target Road, just outside of Holly Hill.  There’s no debate as to whether Strickland shot and killed McWaters, but there is as to whether it was an accident or murder.  Strickland’s murder trial got underway Tuesday with 1st Circuit Assistant Solicitor David Osborne telling the jury that the killing was intentional, not any type of accident.  Osborne told the jury that McWaters was a long-time alcoholic.  “He was drinking himself to an early grave, but it should’ve been God’s call when Robert’s time on Earth was over,” he said.  Osborne claims Strickland couldn’t have accidentally shot McWaters because of the multiple safety features that were on gun used in the killing.  He also said Strickland initially told law enforcement officers that McWaters came at her, so she fired the gun at him.  The bullet struck him in his right temple.  Strickland later told investigators that McWaters challenged her knowledge of firearms.  She told investigators that she retrieved her son’s pistol from a dresser drawer in the extra bedroom.  Video of Strickland’s interview with investigators was played for the jury.  In it, she told Orangeburg County Sheriff’s Office Lt. James Shumpert that she was holding the gun and McWaters said, “You don’t know how to do it” as he sat on a chair at the kitchen table.  “I’m holding the gun. I didn’t know how to take it (the safeties) off, but I got it off,” she said.  She claims the gun accidentally discharged.  She put the gun back in its holster, according to authorities, before she called 911.  Defense attorney Jack Swerling told the jury that even though McWaters and Strickland’s relationship “was volatile and contentious, there was mutual feeling between each other. That’s why they stayed together.”  “She had no intention of leaving” the relationship, Swerling said.  The jury heard testimony that there had been a couple of calls for law enforcement to respond to the home previously concerning domestic disputes.  In one call, Strickland told responding Deputy Donald Huffman that McWaters kept waking her up while she tried to sleep.  Video footage from Huffman’s body camera was played for the jury.  Huffman told Strickland to consider going to a magistrate’s office to try to get the eviction process started to have McWaters leave.  Strickland never sought McWaters’ eviction.  Some of the witnesses the state called on Tuesday include:  Officer Michael Mann, who was employed by the Holly Hill Police Department at the time of the killing.  He was the first officer to respond to the residence at the request of the Orangeburg County Sheriff’s Office.  The jury watched Mann’s body camera video recording at the scene.  They saw Strickland was overcome with emotion and crying when Mann arrived at the house.  She was outside while using her phone and pointed to the inside of the home.  Orangeburg County Sheriff’s Office Deputy Roman Rodriguez, the first deputy to arrive on the scene.  Officer Joseph Henry Daugherty, Strickland’s ex-husband. Daugherty formerly worked at the Holly Hill Police Department, but wasn’t an officer there when McWaters was killed.  Daugherty testified that Strickland called him and told him that she’d “hurt” McWaters.  He told Strickland to call 911. He claims that she told him she did call 911, but no one answered.  Daugherty said he then called the Orangeburg County Sheriff’s Office dispatch number to report what Strickland told him.  Bruce Owens, of Holly Hill, testified that he let McWaters and Strickland rent the mobile home he had at 773 Target Road.  Owens told the jury that he’d known the McWaters family for a number of years.  He told the jury that McWaters wasn’t employed and was an alcoholic.  He also told them that Strickland was employed at tried to make ends meet in the household, but they didn’t always pay their rent on time.  Orangeburg County Sheriff’s Office Lt. William McCormick told the jury about photos he took at the crime scene, which included the shell casing from the bullet that was fired, the holstered firearm and various interior views of the home.  The trial will resume on Tuesday at 9:30 a.m. The trial is expected to last three or four days.  Circuit Judge Diane Goodstein is presiding.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFodHRwczovL3RoZXRhbmRkLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2NyaW1lLWFuZC1jb3VydHMvd29tYW4tb24tdHJpYWwtaW4taG9sbHktaGlsbC1kZWF0aC1kZWZlbnNlLXNob290aW5nLXdhcy1hY2NpZGVudC9hcnRpY2xlX2M5YTFlOTY4LWY0NDAtMTFlZC1hNDgyLTNiY2EyZWE0OWExYy5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Langenkamp was biking in Bethesda, Maryland when the driver of a semi-truck hit and killed her while turning right into a parking lot.  ""All that white line is, is an invitation. It's a death trap to bicyclists who think they're safe because they're in a bike lane,"" Dirk Debbink, Langenkamp's father, said.

The bill would allocate existing federal funding to allow state and local government to build safer pathways for bicyclists and pedestrians.  ""Every day the dollars sit there and not out here, it's another day somebody else could get killed,"" Debbink said.

Do not let her do anything that she can get hurt doing.'""  Alfonso Ribeiro/Instagram, Joce zerojack/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images  Ribeiro added, ""That obviously wasn't listened to. And so my nanny was running back into the house to get pads and stuff and [Ava] went on a little sit-down scooter anyway.""  ""How long has your wife been a psychic?,"" asked Ripa, to which Ribeiro responded, ""Unfortunately, most of her life. She very rarely gets things wrong and sees things coming. You don't always listen to that feeling, and I think that all mothers have that beautiful intuition.""  ""That was very specific but all mothers have that intuition,"" he continued. ""You carry this soul around in your body for nine months; there is a connection that men can never understand that women have with their babies.

The incident took place about midnight on Monday at the intersection of Newark Avenue and Coles Street. According to authorities, a male in his thirties was hurt in the collision.    The car that hit him fled the scene, and officers made no mention of the vehicle’s make or model. Authorities added that the victim was rushed to an area hospital, where he remains in serious but stable condition.  The prosecutor’s office requests that anybody with knowledge of the accident contact them. An investigation remains ongoing in the meantime.    Our thoughts are with the injured victim and his family at this time. We hope for his full recovery.  Pedestrian Accident Injuries in New Jersey  According to the most recent available accident statistics, a pedestrian was killed in a traffic collision in New Jersey 27% of the time over the last year alone.  Tragically, any pedestrian in New Jersey who is out for a stroll runs the risk of being in a collision. But some age groups see more traffic-related fatalities than others. For instance, adults over the age of 65 make up about 20% of all pedestrian accident fatalities. What’s more, New Jersey ranked among the top states for pedestrian deaths and injuries.  The busy streets in New Jersey clearly pose a threat to pedestrians, but the state has passed several laws that drivers must abide by to keep pedestrians safe. Drivers that break these prohibitions may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, particularly if a pedestrian is hurt. Drivers in New Jersey have a duty of care to pedestrians, and when they fail to uphold this responsibility, they may be held civilly accountable. Although pedestrians frequently sustain injuries in accidents, you have the right to use the road safely as a pedestrian in New Jersey.  At any time and at every intersection, pedestrians have the right to cross the roadway safely while walking on the sidewalk. Drivers are accountable for maintaining awareness of their surroundings and treating every other vehicle—including bicycles, trucks, and pedestrians—with respect. People’s disregard for others causes these awful accidents. You don’t have to go through this ordeal by yourself. You need to seek the assistance of a New Jersey pedestrian accident attorney.  If you have a Jersey City pedestrian accident lawyer on your side, your chances of winning your personal injury case will be greatly boosted.

Share Copy Link Copy  Hide Transcript Show Transcript  Leo played it perfect tone which was, he's shivering. He could barely form the words, he knows he's gonna die. We've already seen that. He's made *** sacrifice for her. Of course, very controversial. You know, that he could have gotten on the, on the, the, the raft with her, but he saw that it would have compromised her safety and he kind of steps back. He did what the gentleman on the ship did. I was happy when I wrote that scene, I'll be back, I'll be back. So that, that's *** funny thing because in the script, it, it actually read, I think I'll come back and there was something about the way Arnold said it with his then quite thick Austrian accent. That didn't sound quite right. And so I said, well, just switch it to, I'll be back, you know, and he said, really? I said, yeah, and we just kind of, you know, made it up, made it up in the moment and of course, it became quite iconic. But here's the interesting thing about that line. You're watching the movie for the first time, you have no idea what's gonna happen next. And yet it still got *** laugh somehow people had gotten already. This guy was this bulldozer. You just get this innate sense of this guy as just this juggernaut. And when he says I'll be back, it's gonna be bad. So people laughed before they even knew they didn't even know what *** Terminator movie was at that point. Well, I think they were starting to figure it out. Come with me if you want to live. Terminator Two. That's the pivotal moment where Sarah has this stunning realization that the Terminator that's before her, her worst nightmare has turned into her savior and the savior of her son. And it was just *** fun moment to see how Linda would play that. We knew it was *** tough moment for her because her whole reality literally flips upside down. She played it beautifully. It's just *** nice piece of acting chicken. Oh, it's *** pure moment of exultation for him. He's just alive. He's in the moment he doesn't have *** penny in his pocket. He won the damn ticket in *** poker game. He's just living carefree fancy free. He's met Fabrizio and they're just having fun. It was an expression of life, his life spirit, which seems so unquenchable and so full of potential. Every time I'm aching by, I'm getting ready to do *** run. I'm, I'm talking to Leo on the radio. Ok. Howl, like *** wolf. You know, I got him howling like *** wolf. We tried it, you know, I don't know, 10 times and he looked great and his, his acting spirit was there, but we just couldn't quite find the right word and it just popped into my head. I said, just say, I'm the king of the world. I hear back on the lucky what I said, you gotta sell it, you gotta sell it. You know, just say I'm the king of the world and he did and he put his arms out and you feel that spirit and it became the focal point of the whole scene, the whole ship's energy, the pounding of the engines, the dolphins jumping and everything, all, you know, the sort of the beauty and the power and the majesty of it all culminated to his, his spirit at the, at the bow. Now I come along at the Academy Awards and make the classic mistake of assuming that just because we had won best picture or that, that I got be best director that everybody in the room loved the movie and would celebrate *** reference to the movie, but they weren't, not everybody voted for it, right? And the knives are always, they're, they're kind of always half drawn even when they're there to celebrate you. The knife is half out of the, out of the, the hilt. I mean out of the, the sheath, right? Yeah. So I put my foot in that one, Jack. I want you to draw me like one of your French girls, *** lot of people have, have kind of mocked and spoofed that line. But I think *** lot of people really like it. She's bold. She's taking the power. She's been robbed of power by her fiance, by her mother, by her social straitjacket. He's this devil may care, free spirit, artistic spirit, all the things that she wants to be and she just flips the script and tells him to do his thing. I think people celebrate her empowerment as *** character in, in that moment, it's also the promise of romance, the promise of sex. It's also this great liberation and it's my 40 something year old hand as Leo's 20 year old hand. But I do the, the picture and then Leo just made some head scratching, you know, while he was fiercely concentrating on, on her and pretending to draw. The only problem is I draw left handed and he was madly drawn way right handed. I should have made *** draw left handed. When you sketch, there's an arc that's formed by your wrist. So all my lines are arching in this direction. Now, I've got to do the drawing backwards. So if you look in the movie, I'm doing the outlining, but I'm not doing any of the shading. I'm doing the smudging cause I couldn't do it because the arcs were all the wrong, wrong direction. I don't know about you, but I intend to write *** strongly worded letter to the White Star line about all this. I just think people appreciate Jack's presence of mind to be taking the stress out of the situation for her by making *** joke. And Leo played it perfect tone which was, he's shivering. He can barely form the words. He knows he's gonna die. We've already seen that he's made *** sacrifice for her, of course, very controversial. You know, that he could have gotten on the, on the, the, the raft with her, but he saw that it would have compromised her safety and he kind of steps back. He did what the gentleman on the ship did when they stepped back from the life boats to save the women and Children first because that was honor and duty. I was happy when I wrote that scene. Get away from her. You ***. That's *** great uh iconic moment. The moment we knew we had them was then they just burst into wild applause on that line. They loved it. So we knew the movie had had landed. And then you realize this movie is about two females of different species, protecting their young and it's on, it was just the right line at the right time in that movie. And then the audience response to it reminded me why you do this. I was *** marine. Hey, yeah, *** warrior of the jarhead clan. My brother Dave uh was *** marine. He died recently and you go your whole life as *** marine. Jake doesn't matter where he goes in the universe if he was *** US marine at some point, he's *** marine. Only *** marine can call himself *** jarhead unless they're *** marine. In which case it's ok. So that was just *** little inside kind of marine corps reference. I put ***, I put *** few of them in, you know, kind of for my brother Dave who's *** guy that I really loved and admired. I see here, I see you, I see you as *** very important line. It resonates for people *** lot just popped into my head while I was writing the treatment in 95. And it's like, what would *** navy greeting be? You're walking towards somebody and I see you, you know, I basically kind of the simplicity of it, right? And then it started to take on various layers of meaning as I thought, well, what do people really want? They want to be seen? They want to be acknowledged, they want to be recognized, they want to be respected, they wanna be loved seeing it. It took on *** deeper meaning. Jake's kind of struggling with the idea. But of course, the whole movie is about that. The movie starts with him opening his eyes and it ends with him opening, he has woken up to *** greater experience of the world to *** deeper understanding. He's the only human that's ever truly understood the navi from their perspective and he inhabits as his avatar, he inhabits their world. And of course, he's learning from this woman that he's falling in love with. I think you're never more open than when you're falling in love with somebody that can teach you something. And so I see you took on many meanings. You know, I understand you, I acknowledge you, I respect you, I love you. There's the top layer of the movie which is plot and character. And then there's the second layer of the movie, which is thematic, right? Which is about themes of indigenous culture and human civilization, kind of at war with itself, you know, pulling us away from our connection to nature and all those, all those things. But there's another layer, there's *** tertiary layer which is mystical. If we don't service that layer as well, then we're not really doing *** worthy sequel or worthy Sequels to the first film. It continues to be important to ask the audience to see kind of with better eyes, some of the things that are, you know, our problems and our world. I mean, Avatar doesn't pretend to have some great solution. It's just saying, you know, our our our human journey is is very troubled right now. This is our whole, this is our family, this is our fortress. I question it. As I go along spending five years on essentially one ip one, you know, it's, it's 2.5 movies that we've been working on over the last last five years. You know, I question it and then I start seeing the results and then it's *** no brainer at that point. Then it just all comes to life and that world comes to life and you see the characters come to life. It's kind of magical. You know, sometimes I have to pinch myself when I see the end result of the process. So you just have to have faith in the process as you, as you go along. I knew I wanted to tell *** family story. I wanted to as an artist express some of the, the things, the ideas, the feelings that I had as *** parent and that I had observed in my kids and I'd done sort of parent child stories in the past, even all the way back to, to aliens and uh Terminator Two, but I hadn't lived it. There was *** lot of uh sort of great dramatic grist for the mill there uh around the dysfunction of families. But how there's *** strength at the core of families that helps get people through times are all in this highly angst ridden, highly anxious time. Right now. I wanted to within *** fantasy world show, special to *** young audience. It's ok even in even, you know, 200 years from now on *** distant planet, you know, kids are still gonna feel anxious or, or, or depressed or, or unseen, it's ok. You know, I'm just not only channeling my experience as *** parent, but my experience as *** teenager myself. And I just thought that that foundation of universal human experience put into the most far flung fantasy environment that you can imagine grounds it emotionally.

An online campaign raised tens of thousands of dollars, with many donations accompanied by wishes of a fast recovery for Mary Jane Mullen, a Lenape secretary for the past 61 years.  But the campaign’s tenor changed abruptly when Mullen, 79, died from her injuries Sunday.

Mary Jane Mullen spent her career at Lenape  “She felt a genuine love for all things Lenape, including students, staff, and alumni,” he said. “She was always ready with a hug, a kiss, and some candy for anyone who needed it.”  Mullen, a sophomore when Lenape opened in 1958, went to work for the school’s administration one month after graduating from Lenape in June 1961.

""She approached each day with genuine love, kindness and caring,"" the statement said.  Over the decades, the Medford resident sent ""thousands upon thousands of personalized notes"" to students, staffers and Lenape family members, said Carol Birnbohm, the district's superintendent.  She said the notes delivered messages of encouragement, gratitude and love from Mullen, who also bought Christmas ornaments and other gifts for students and staff.  One note, written last month, described Lenape as Mullen's ""happy place.""  ""I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else. This is my home,"" it said.  Cattani said graduates who return to the school for reunion activities typically inquire about Mullen.  ""Without fail, the first thing they ask is, ‘Is Mary Jane still here?’”  A display of photos in Lenape's 1980 yearbook, Legend, shows Mullen surrounded by smiling students. A sketch depicts a harried secretary typing between wire baskets piled high with papers.  The headlines read “MJ Club” and “Mary Jane, Mary Jane, She’s Our Girl.”  Text with the photos describes Mullen as “bubbling with effervescence” and notes she “attracts all sorts to her office.”  GoFundMe appeal started on day of accident  A Lenape graduate launched the GoFundMe campaign on the day of Mullen's accident. It sought to help with Mullen’s medical costs and to support a scholarship fund in her honor.  According to Medford police, Mullen's car collided with another vehicle at Route 70 and North Main Street.  She was taken to the trauma center at Cooper University Hospital, Camden. The other driver had no reported injuries from the accident, which remains under investigation.  Mullen initially was in good spirits but still had “a long road ahead,” said the appeal, which had raised almost $50,000 by Wednesday evening.  The expressions of hope and affection turned somber on Sunday.  ""Mary Jane was a Saint to all who entered her Office Domain,"" wrote one donor, Daniel Archibald. ""She will be missed but hopefully her legacy survives.""  “MaryJane is (an) angel now and always has been,” said another donor, Susan Burns.  Cattani noted members of Burlington County’s school crisis response team and other school counselors were made available to students and staffers.  “I ask all of our members of the Lenape Family to look after one another as we deal with the loss of our friend and someone who truly exemplified Lenape High School,” the principal wrote.  He said the school ""will plan a special way to memorialize Mary Jane in the near future.""  Services will be held at St. Mary of the Lakes Church, 40 Jackson Road, Medford, where friends may call Wednesday from 6 to 9 p.m.  A Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated Thursday.  Burial will be private.  Jim Walsh is a senior reporter at the Courier-Post, Burlington County Times and The Daily Journal.

The Utah Occupational Safety and Health Division “will not be investigating the fatality specifically but looking for any safety violations that could have caused or contributed to the cause of the accident,” Eric Olsen, communications director for the Utah Labor Commission, said Tuesday.  A statement from the Clearfield Police Department said Monday’s incident at Americold at 755 E. 1700 South is being investigated but that “initial information suggests this was a tragic accident.” The department didn’t name the 38-year-old man pending notification of extended family members.  The Clearfield incident is the 10th industrial death this year. “So far this year, including yesterday’s unfortunate event, there have been 10 workplace fatalities that fall under UOSH jurisdiction and are not attributed to preexisting conditions or sudden health problems such as heart attack,” Olsen said.  The man was somehow pinned between a forklift and freezer shelves, according to the Clearfield Police Department.  “First responders worked quickly and were able to free the victim from the entrapment and rendered some medical aid on scene in preparation for transport to the hospital,” said the police statement. But he had suffered “significant trauma to lower extremities” and died soon after reaching Holy Cross Hospital in Layton.

According to WLKY, the accident happened on Interstate 64 in Harrison County, which is located in southern Indiana, on the afternoon of May 4.  Watch a C8 Corvette in a street takeover here.  You can see the cab of the truck which hit the Corvette transport is crushed, as are the cars on the end of the transport. According to the report, the transporter had merged onto I-64 and was getting up to speed, something which takes quite the distance for a laden truck, when the other semi ran into the back of it.  This sadly is a real danger when big trucks are merging onto freeways. They often struggle to get up to speed and since they’re so large, it can be more difficult to accurately judge their speed from a distance.

To tell the story of its accidental origin, you need to know why it's special in the first place. Ice wine, often written as one word ('icewine') in Canada, and known as 'eiswein' in its native land of Germany, is wine pressed from frozen grapes.  The flavor of grape juice comes from the various sugars, acids, and aromatic compounds it contains, but a majority of the juice (roughly 70-80%) is plain old water. When grapes are left on the vine in the winter snow, that water freezes and the flavorful compounds separate. Thus, when the grapes are finally juiced, the water content is far lower than usual, resulting in juice that is more like extremely concentrated grape syrup. After the mixture is fermented for a few months, you're left with one of the sweetest and most flavorful wines in existence. The results are rather magical, and it's all thanks to the ingenuity of German vintners, who adapted to sudden harsh conditions.

And I say with due disregard, they’re just not really paying attention,” Fire Chief David Toomey said. “They’re just trying to have a good time and I understand that.”  The wreck comes one week after Willie Gray heard an out of control personal watercraft strike his dock at the home he’s lived in for more than 30 years.  “As you can see right now, it’s very calm, but on the weekends it gets crazy here,” Gray said. “And it’s still early in the season.”  Crews are urging people to make sure they use the kill switch on their personal watercraft and wear a flotation device when on the water. It’s something Tomas Suska knows all too well. He said five years ago, he was on a jet ski when he was struck and had to go to the hospital afterwards.  “Just got in a T-bone accident and didn’t have time to react. The guy was broken in two different places, so you just got to be very careful,” he said.  Faherty asked NC Wildlife about possible charges in the Sea-Doo crash they said the case remains under investigation.  This is a developing story, check back at wsoctv.com for updates.

"accident","2023-05-14","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Mon 15 May 2023 01:11:51","COLE COUNTY, Mo. (KMIZ)  A Cole County ATV crash left four kids in a Columbia hospital Sunday morning. Another man was seriously injured in Cooper County after an ATV crash Saturday. Two other reports of ATV crashes were recorded in the past week from Moniteau County and Randolph County.  An increase in off-road riders starts anytime temperatures rise, Cpl. Kyle Green with the Missouri State Highway Patrol said. But the chance of getting into an accident also grows.  “They're not toys at all,” Green added. “But that's the way many people view them.”  Last year alone, the Missouri State Highway Patrol recorded 284 total ATV crashes in the state. Over 70% of those resulted in injuries and 23 of those crashes were fatal. In many cases, Green said safety devices in the vehicle weren’t being used if they had them.  “That's unfortunately where we get many of these serious crashes,” Green said. “Where people aren't wearing helmets or they're not wearing the seatbelts and they get thrown out into the woods.”  At the same time, all-terrain vehicle crashes present a different problem for first responders. Cole County EMS said Sunday’s crash was in a remote location.  “ATVs present a little bit more of an operational issue for us,” Eric Hoy the Chief of Emergency Medical Services said. “We think there was a delay in activating 911 because they were in such a rural area that they had to get somewhere where they could actually call.”  Additionally, ambulances were not able to reach the scene alone. The EMS Incident Commander requested mutual aid for all-terrain transport vehicles from the Cole County Emergency Response Team, the Jefferson City Fire Department and Osage Ambulance District.  “It really limits the capabilities of the first responders,” Green said. “If you're going to be out on property that's in a hard-to-reach spot, hard to locate, then you need to let somebody know… in case something happens, at least we have an idea where to start searching.”  Driving an all-terrain vehicle impaired is just that too- impaired driving. In 2022, the Missouri State Highway Patrol recorded 50 ATV accidents caused by drinking or drugs.  “Operating these while impaired is dangerous for not only them but for the other people that are out on the roadways,” Green added.  In Missouri, there’s no set age to drive an all-terrain vehicle. While children under 18 must legally wear a helmet, they can drive freely on private property. In the same way, the Missouri State Highway Patrol warns it’s the parent’s responsibility to make sure the kid is ready “mentally and physically” to drive an ATV.  Wearing a helmet and seatbelt, if the vehicle has one, can decrease the chances of being injured in an ATV or UTV crash Green said. Letting someone know where you’re headed and having a way to contact 911 if needed can help emergency services get to you more quickly if needed.  Driving an ATV with the same mentality as driving a vehicle could help avoid an accident completely.  “Just be sure to take extra caution just like you would in your vehicle,” Hoy added.  Drivers can find more on ATV or UTV rules and regulations for Missouri here.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vYWJjMTduZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL3RyYW5zcG9ydGF0aW9uLzIwMjMvMDUvMTQvYXR2LXNhZmV0eS1wcmVjYXV0aW9ucy1hcy1hY2NpZGVudHMtY29udGludWUtaW4tbWlzc291cmkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
