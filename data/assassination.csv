The intensity of violence unleashed by the workers of Imran’s party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), was well beyond expectations. The rampage resulted in the loss of over a dozen lives and colossal damage to the property, including that of military establishments. Despite the ruthless crackdown by security forces, the environment continues to be volatile.  The explosive situation took another dramatic turn two days later when on 11 May, the Supreme Court of Pakistan (SC) ordered Imran Khan’s immediate release, calling his arrest to be illegal. While Imran’s followers rejoiced, the government accused the judiciary of acting politically and favouring the former prime minister. The SC decision came as a jolt even for the army. The next very day, Islamabad High Court granted bail to Imran Khan along with two weeks’ reprieve from arrest in the Al-Qadir trust case. It also provided him immunity from arrest in any case filed after 9 May. Immediately on his release, Imran Khan went ballistic, squarely blaming the Army Chief General Asim Munir for destroying the nation and creating chaos.  The gravity of the prevailing situation reverberates the outrage that followed former prime minister Benazir Bhutto’s assassination in 2007. Ongoing unrest probably is the worst since 1971, which ended up in the dismemberment of Pakistan. The current political calamity could not have come at the worst time when Pakistan is in the grip of a serious economic crisis, almost on the verge of bankruptcy.  In its 75 years of existence, for half the time Pakistan has been ruled by army generals. Even during the times, the civilian government was in place, the army continued to exercise effective control by proxy. For that matter, Imran Khan also wears the tag of the selected prime minister as the army played a key role in his coming to power in 2018, orchestrating the dismissal of the Nawaz Sharif government on corruption charges.  Going by the history of civil-military relations in Pakistan, no civilian government has been able to complete its full term. So was the case with Imran Khan who fell out of favour with the then Army Chief General Qamar Bajwa, his benefactor, over the appointment of DG ISI (Director General Inter Service Intelligence). While Imran Khan wanted Lt Gen Faiz Hameed to continue as the head of ISI and subsequently take over as the Chief, General Bajwa overruled the prime minister and appointed Lt Gen Nadeem Anjum as the DG.  The army ultimately got rid of Imran Khan last April, by engineering his toppling through a ‘no confidence motion’ paving the way for Shehbaz Sharif to become the prime minister. After his ouster, Imran Khan vociferously took up an anti-army stance, gaining considerable public popularity in the process. He went on to level allegations against Major General Faisal Nasser, head of counter-intelligence in ISI for an attempt on his life. Imran Khan has been demanding early elections in a bid to cash in the favourable public sentiments. However, his coming to power is not in the army’s interest. General Asim Munir, in fact, has a personal grudge against Imran Khan for removing him from the post of DG ISI prematurely when he reportedly initiated an investigation of corruption charges against Bushra Bibi-Imran’s wife.  Unprecedented public anger is directed against the Pakistan Army (Chief) fueled by hardships faced by the common person in the wake of harsh economic conditions, given that military continues to maintain a lavish lifestyle. There are also reports about dissidence within the army, evident from a major military reshuffle wherein Lt Gen Salman Ghani commander of the Lahore-based Corps stands replaced by Lt Gen Fayyaz Shah. Reports of purges against the pro-Imran elements in the army have also surfaced."

If reports are to be believed, Vladimir Putin has reportedly signed a decree which will make obtaining Russian citizenship for foreign nationals easy and quick.  The decree, which is signed by the Russian President is likely to simplify the process of obtaining Russian citizenship for those foreign nationals, who will serve in Russia's army against Ukraine. As per a report in the Hindustan Times, the decree will apply only to foreign nations who will sign contracts with the Russian army to serve in the military for a period of one year.

As per the report, only those individuals and their family members who serve in the army will be eligible to apply for Russian citizenship. These individuals will not be required to obtain a residence permit. Reportedly, the move by Russian President Vladimir Putin comes after the counteroffensive by Ukraine against Russia's invasion.  Several reports also claim that Vladimir Putin has signed a number of decrees in a bid to boost the number of his troops as Russia faces loss amid the ongoing war. The move to grant Russian citizenship to foreign nationals comes a year after the Russian government last year approved legislation to remove the upper age limit for contractual service in the Russian army.

They visited the spot where Aya was tragically shot to lay flowers and to remember her life.  Aspiring law student Aya, 19, was murdered during the month of Ramadan on Sunday, May 17, 2020, as she walked by Quick Shine Car Wash on Whalley Banks.  She was struck by a stray bullet, shot from a passing Toyota Avensis.  Aya’s mum, Samar Salame visited Blackburn and was joined by some of Aya’s friends.  New pictures were also released of the student by the family.  The family have said it is very difficult to return to the town following the events of 2020, having since moved to London.  Mrs Salame spent time putting flowers around a pole which has become a focal point for commemorations each year.  She had to be supported by friends who had come to pay their own respects to Aya.  On occasions passers-by would stop to say dua (prayers) and others came to lay their own flowers at the spot.  Aya’s mum, Samar Salame visited Blackburn on the anniversary of the death  Speaking today Mrs Salame said found it hard to return to the town since the death of her daughter.  Holding back tears she had to be comforted by Aya’s friends as she spoke.  She said: “It is not fair. For those people to be breathing and alive and my daughter she under the soil in her grave.  “Still her brothers and sisters are suffering. Our life is damaged. They smashed us. They killed us.  “I hope their prisons will be their graves.”  New pictures of Aya have been released on the third anniversary of her death (NQ/Aya Hachem Family)  Permanent memorial to remember Aya  It has also been revealed there are plans to make a permanent memorial at the site where Aya was killed.  This will be in the form of a plaque on the pole, which would be painted the colour green.  The family are said to be looking at producing their own plaque which would be a permanent reminder of that fateful day and also celebrate the life of Aya.  The pole is owned by broadband company 6G Internet and the firm said they would work with the family in ‘whatever way they could’.  Simon Jones from 6G Internet said: “This is an extremely sombre time for the family, the local community and the whole town.  “If the family wish to commemorate the life of Aya Hachem at the site with a permanent memorial we will do whatever we can to assist them.”  The company also said it would pay for any costs incurred for the memorial.  Who was Aya Hachem?  Aya was an aspiring lawyer who was studying at the University of Salford, and her family had moved to Blackburn 10 years before her death, fleeing from violence in Lebanon.  Five years after arriving in the country, a 14-year-old Aya Hachem and her parents went to a charity event to help traumatised refugees settle into life in the county.  In the decade she lived in the town, Aya thrust herself into British life, learning English and excelling at school. She became one of the Children’s Society’s youngest ever trustees at 16.  Aya started at the University of Salford when she was 18 and was in her second year when she was murdered.  What happened on the day  Aya Hachem was walking home from Lidl, passing Quick Shine Tyres in Blackburn on May 17, 2020, when a hit which had been organised to kill the business owner, Pachah Khan, tragically saw her shot and killed.  The assassination attempt was organised by one of the owners of RI Tyres, Quick Shine’s neighbouring business, because they were angry about the fact Quick Shine had started to sell tyres.  Feroz Suleman masterminded a plan to have Mr Khan killed, bringing in trusted friends and allies to help carry out the shooting.  Feroz Suleman, Zamir Raja, Anthony Ennis, Louis Otway, Ayaz Hussain, Kashim Manzoor, Uthman Satia and Abubakr Satia have all been found guilty of murder and attempted murder.  Judy Chapman was found guilty of manslaughter.  Suhayl Suleman, brother of Feroz stood trial for the murder of Aya and attempted murder of Pachah Khan but was acquitted."

Farooq had been killed 33 years back.  The family has asked the J&K government to take the case of the father-son duo’s killing to a logical conclusion.  “We praise the J&K police for cracking the assassination case of Moulvi Mohammad Farooq after 33 years… We once again urge upon the J&K Lt Governor as well Government of India for not only reopening of this case and taking this case to a logical conclusion, so as to bring the culprits of this whole conspiracy to justice,” Rajinder Premi, son of Sarwanand Koul Premi said.

Lincoln’s attempt to comprehend divine purpose in the tragedy of “American Slavery” and the war that ended it remains a work of bracing spiritual honesty, all the more surprising for the fact that its author had once had to print a handbill assuring the public that he was not an “open scoffer” at religion.  Tackling this paradox is the challenge before Joshua Zeitz, a biographer of Lincoln’s two secretaries, John Hay and John Nicolay, who now turns his lens on the president himself.  Lincoln’s religion has been treated before, in the hagiographies that followed his assassination, when “Americans needed to memorialize Lincoln as a Christian martyr,” as Zeitz puts it, and in the writings of his former law partner, William Herndon, who set out to define him as an “un-believer.” Zeitz weaves between the dogmas, revealing a complex thinker who deftly merged religious language with political goals and underwent a “spiritual renewal” during the Civil War, especially after the death of his son Willie in 1862.  Zeitz adds meaningful context to the story, examining the ways in which soldiers experienced religion in the field; both sides held revival meetings. Above and below the Mason-Dixon line, religious leaders leaned into the conflict and found reasons to believe they enjoyed a special relationship with the Almighty. The Confederacy claimed God’s support in its Constitution and motto (“Deo vindice”). Southern leaders denounced Northerners as “infidels,” a word that was sometimes applied to Lincoln, and claimed that the Bible justified slavery.  Lincoln, of course, disagreed with that selective reading, and as he moved decisively against slavery in the final years of the war, he often claimed a spiritual justification. His speeches drew heavily on Scripture, including, in 1858, the “house divided” (Matthew 12:25); then, at Gettysburg, “four score and seven years ago” (paraphrasing Psalm 90); the second Inaugural Address, with its readings from Matthew 18:7 (“woe unto the world because of offenses …”); and Psalm 19 (“the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether”). Frederick Douglass, who was present at the second inauguration, called it “more like a sermon than a state paper.” One scholar estimated that “266 of its 702 words were quoted verbatim from the word of God.”"

Today, his production company Broadway and Vine is bringing a bevy of stage and screen celebs to Wine Country — and all before the company’s second birthday.  Its summer outdoor concert series, announced in April, includes San Francisco native Darren Criss (FX’s “The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story,” Fox’s “Glee” and “Hedwig and the Angry Inch” on Broadway) on July 28; Sutton Foster (TV Land’s “Younger,” “The Music Man” on Broadway with Hugh Jackman) on Aug. 2; and actor and model Brooke Shields on Aug. 29. It all kicks off with Tituss Burgess (Netflix’s “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt” and “Schmigadoon!” on Apple TV+) on June 27. Attendees enjoy not just a concert in a vineyard under the evening sky, but also a wine tasting and a vintner dinner.  The story of how Langfelder made his career leap draws equally on his time treading the boards and his gigs reciting menu specials.  “As most people do, I got into waiting tables as a survival job,” the Springfield, Ill., native told The Chronicle. But unlike many aspiring actors, “I fell in love with hospitality.”  In between touring with Jonathan Groff in “The Sound of Music” or performing in Stephen Sondheim musicals, he worked at Craft as Tom Colicchio (“Top Chef”) was becoming a celebrity chef and at other haute cuisine spots including Jean-Georges and Daniel.  “Maybe it was a bit of the performer in me,” Langfelder recalled. To him, serving meals at a hip restaurant was like acting in a hit show.  On vacations, he discovered another love — Napa Valley — finally seeing in person the wine regions he discussed with restaurant patrons.  Around 2013, his passions for hospitality and theater merged for the first time when he started managing 54 Below, which included booking artists.  “When I started putting artists onstage, I got that same — not butterflies, but that excitement of when I was onstage,” Langfelder said. “I fought so hard to be on the stage, and to finally have something that I could lend to other artists was really fulfilling.”  Then in 2016, he happened to be talking with friends in Bouchon Bakery Time Warner about where to take a show when Thomas Keller walked by and sat down. “I said, ‘I would really love to bring Broadway to Napa,’ ” Langfelder recounted. Keller was receptive to the idea and made some introductions with Wine Country movers and shakers.  Keller was “happy to have played a small part in something that is enriching the Napa Valley arts community,” he said in a statement to The Chronicle.  Langfelder officially moved to the region in 2018, getting to know the scene by producing events for Festival Napa Valley, the annual event blending arts performances, wine and food. It takes place this year July 8-23.  Langfelder’s Broadway and Vine, blending Wine Country’s comestibles, libations and vineyard views with a chance to see Broadway stars without all the razzle-dazzle, debuted with Tony Award nominee Tony Yazbeck in 2021, as much of the rest of the world was reopening from the pandemic, thanks to vaccines.  But Napa had its additional wounds. When Langfelder introduced Yazbeck at Tre Posti in St. Helena, he could see the scars of 2020’s Glass Fire across the valley. “We were all just starved to do something,” Langfelder said. He thought, “Can I just do, like, one show? And if it doesn’t work we’ll just throw in the towel?”  But it did work. Since then, Broadway and Vine has hosted Lea Michele (“Glee” and “Funny Girl” on Broadway), Fairfield native Taylor Iman Jones (“Head Over Heels”) and Abby Mueller (“Beautiful: The Carole King Musical”). The company adds to the Broadway offerings of Transcendence Theatre Company, which also produces in the region but specializes in large-cast revues.  Langfelder knows tourists might not associate Wine Country with Broadway, so he especially looks for crossover talent. He also acknowledged that some of his guests are coming for the concerts and that others attend for the food and wine bigwigs.  “You get the performer saying, ‘I have no idea who these wine people are, but I love all of it,’ ” Langfelder said, “and the same with the vice versa.”  To witness top-tier musical talent in the middle of nature’s splendor? “You essentially get to be Julie Andrews on the mountaintop,” Langfelder said."

However, the focus doesn’t stay on them long, as One Piece chapter 1084 then focuses on the Empty Throne room, where Cobra Nefertari is meeting with the Gorosei. He seems to be discussing some aspect of the Void Century and the World Government’s formation with them, given the use of the numbers “800” and “20” in his dialogue.  Cobra seems to be discussing a former Queen of Alabasta, seemingly corroborating the information found in text-based spoilers earlier in the week. The Gorosei show no visible reactions to this topic, but Cobra seems to be getting sterner and sterner as the conversation continues.  It’s then revealed that Im-sama has been listening to this conversation the entire time from the Room of Flowers. Meanwhile, Cobra is bringing up the initial “D,” which gets a rise out of a majority of the Gorosei. One Piece chapter 1084 then shifts to elsewhere at the Reverie, where Saint Charlos is yet again trying to capture Shirahoshi.  Other Celestial Dragons are seemingly telling the overjoyed Charlos not to do this, but he doesn’t seem to listen. Shirahoshi’s brother, Fukaboshi, then angrily rushes onto the scene, clearly intent on reclaiming his sister. He rushes Charlos, prompting Kuma to fire a laser beam in his direction. Thankfully, both he and Shirahoshi are able to get out of the way in time.  Fukaboshi then continues to rush Charlos while Rebecca, Leo of the Tontatta Tribe, and Sai of the Happo Navy observe. Saint Donquixote Mjosgard, who has personal ties with the Neptune royal family, gets in between Fukaboshi and Charlos to stop the former from doing something he’ll regret.  Leo and Sai, meanwhile, both attack Charlos, prompting Morley to take advantage of the opportunity to rescue Kuma. However, he makes himself known to the others as he does this, causing a stir despite the fact that Shirahoshi is now safe. One Piece chapter 1084 then returns to the Empty Throne room, where Im-sama is now ascending the stairs to the Empty Throne.  The Gorosei silently watch as this happens, as does Cobra with a horrified expression on his face. The issue then ends with Im-sama sitting on the Empty Throne and seemingly speaking to Cobra directly. Unfortunately, the chapter does end with the announcement of a series’ break next week.

Contributor/Getty Images; FBK; Metro 2000 via Wayback Machine; Alyssa Powell/Insider  You would think that the architects who designed Vladimir Putin's palace thought of everything.  After all, the 190,000-square-foot, billion-dollar complex, perched on a rugged bluff overlooking the Black Sea, has every luxury that an autocrat could possibly desire. As revealed by Alexei Navalny's investigation, the palace has its own church, wine cellar, and casino. It has a hookah lounge complete with a stripper pole, an arboretum, and an ice rink for the hockey games Putin likes to play with cronies. But good luck ordering takeout — security is tight. Putin's imperial dacha is sealed off from the country he rules by 17,000 acres of woodland and a special no-fly zone.  The precautions are more than paranoia on Putin's part. Earlier this month, Russian authorities claimed that two drones had attempted to assassinate Putin in a failed strike that ended in an explosion above the Kremlin.  But, despite all these princely luxuries and castle-like defenses, the palace's builders appear to have neglected one crucial detail. They failed to hide plans showing two elaborate tunnels running beneath the palace complex — plans that any competent state-security apparatus would fight tooth-and-nail to keep secret.  In fact, they were posted publicly to the Russian internet. Metro Style, a now-defunct Russian contractor, posted the diagrams to their website to showcase their work in the early 2010's. They were viewable online as late as 2016.  Today, Insider is publishing annotated versions of the diagrams with English-language translations, which can be viewed below.  The underground complex beneath Putin's palace consists of two separate tunnels connected by an elevator that descends roughly 50 meters below the surface. The architectural plans show the tunnels encased in thick concrete are supplied with enough fresh water, ventilation and extensive cables to support VIP occupants for days or weeks at a time. An expert who reviewed the tunnel plans saw signs of Putin's obsession with survival at a time other strongmen were falling.  Story continues  ""Putin has a lot of anxiety about being the not-entirely-legitimate leader of Russia,"" said Michael C. Kimmage, a former State Department official who worked on Russia and Ukraine policy. ""So knowing that his legitimacy is not entirely secured by elections, he is going to seek to maximize his personal safety through a complex of well-defended personal residences.""  The exits from those tunnels are visible just below the palace complex, on the bare cliff rising up from the beach:  Two entrances to the underground tunnel complex are visible on the hillside beneath Putin's palace. aerial photo by FBK; Insider  The lower tunnel includes a moving walkway leading to the exit. ""This tunnel set-up has all kinds of safety and security,"" said Thaddeus Gabryszewski, a structural engineer familiar with defensive structures who reviewed the diagrams for Insider. ""There's a fire system. There's water, there's sewer. This is intended for someone to survive or escape.""  All leaders of nuclear states make plans for extreme contingencies. The US president has an emergency bunker beneath the White House, and Mount Weather in Virginia. But unlike US facilities, the Black Sea complex was privately funded and remains privately owned. It appears intended not to insure the continuity of a political system so much as the survival of one individual. Putin's investment in a tunnel complex beneath a brand-new vacation home, built during years when he was still publicly flirting with Russian integration into Europe, is evidence of just how long the Russian leader has been preparing for threats, and building the trapdoors he would need to shelter or escape. ""We have to see this as part of a long confrontation with the West that has marked the last 13 or 14 years of Putin's life,"" said Kimmage.  A cross-section of the hillside shows two tunnels connected by an elevator, at right. Metro Style via Wayback Machine; annotations by Insider  ""These images are not blueprints,"" Gabryszewski told Insider. ""They are closer to architectural drawings. They show you the intent, the flow, and the premise of these spaces.""  The two tunnels are approximately 40 and 60 meters long, respectively, and 6 meters wide, creating about 6,500 square feet of potential living space that bears signs of being blast-proof. Their ability to withstand the impact of a nuclear blast or a bunker-buster bomb would depend on two factors that aren't in the diagrams — how the tunnels' 15-inch thick concrete shells are reinforced and the material used to fill the area around them, Gabryszewski said.  They show several features that suggest Putin commissioned the structure with worst-case scenarios in mind. Especially striking are 16 cable racks, each about a foot wide, embedded into the wall of the lower tunnel. These racks are designed for the ""conduit"" cables that can carry electricity, lighting, copper wire and fiber optic cable needed for a command post.  A cross-section showing the interior of the lower tunnel, which includes a moving walkway leading to the beach. Metro Style via Wayback Machine; annotation and translations by Insider  The sheer volume of conduit running through the lower tunnel is important because it's far more than would likely be necessary to operate the tunnel's own internal systems. ""Those trays could be for communications, lighting, power — anything that goes through a cable or tube,"" Gabryszewski said. ""It's an awful lot of cable just for the tunnel itself. So it could be some kind of back-up system for the palace complex."" Rather than serving merely as an escape passage, one of the tunnels' purposes appears to be a kind of emergency spinal cord for the entire palace complex.  Neither the Moscow-based company that acquired Metro Style, nor Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin's chief spokesperson, responded to requests for comment. Amid mass protests triggered by Navalny's 2021 video investigation, Putin denied owning the Black Sea palace.  Metro Style, a company founded in the 90's by three men who have gone on to found several construction companies since, was also hired by the Russian government to dig subway tunnels beneath Moscow. When the company posted the diagrams to their website, they did not specify that the Black Sea tunnels were built for Putin. Instead, they described ""a complex of underground structures for a boarding house in the city of Gelendzhik, Krasnodar Territory."" Gelendzhik is the town closest to the palace complex, a five-hour drive from the resort city of Sochi.  The existence of the fortified tunnels, nearly 1,000 miles away from Moscow, demonstrates that Putin isn't just focussed on indulging his taste for the high life near a resort town. He is also concerned with staying alive. Survivalism was a likely driver behind the tunnels' remote location, said Kimmage, the former State Department official who is now a professor at Catholic University. ""The two times there has been a big transition in Russian history — 1917 and 1991 — the status of the capital city and the leader's position there has been a big issue,"" Kimmage said. ""Putin is solving for that contingency by establishing a network of residences that are as far from the center as possible. So a tunnel system within the Black Sea complex makes a lot of sense. Even without an active threat, he's going to be worrying about this eventuality.""  A cutaway diagram showing the interior of the elevator shaft connecting the two tunnels indicates six separate ventilation shafts designed to deliver fresh or filtered air to the tunnel's occupants.  A cross section of the vertical elevator shaft. Metro Style via Wayback Machine; annotation and translations by Insider  The multiple ventilation shafts and the two separate tunnels could have been designed with a chemical attack in mind, layering in redundancies that make it harder to wholly constrict the palace's supply of clean air; the multiple cable conduits could serve similar purposes. Two separate portals on the hillside ""creates a secondary and tertiary backup for ventilation,"" said Gabryszewski. ""If there's some kind of attack, Putin has got two sources of air intake, one high and one low.""  The diagrams do not offer any detailed views of structures to the east of the tunnel complex. Given that it appears to connect the tunnels with a road, it's possible that the eastern structures are designed to be a route through which supplies can be loaded through the hidden elevator and into the palace complex. Gabryszewski highlighted an area near the end of the road, beside the tunnel complex, that could be used for loading and unloading shipments of supplies.

Google Earth; annotations by Insider  This 3D model shows the two tunnels as well as a third entrance, to the right. 3D model by Sect Ze; annotations by Insider  A link to the diagrams, saved for posterity on the Wayback Machine internet archive, circulated for years among a Moscow subculture known as ""diggers,"" urban explorers who visit and document forbidden sites, before appearing in a comprehensive report on the palace assembled by Navalny, the Russian opposition politician who is now serving a 9-year sentence in a Russian penal colony. The diagrams were first brought to Insider's attention by an anonymous digger who said he was affiliated with a group called ""Sect Ze."" A spokesperson for the group said in an email exchange that they were sharing their findings ""because we are tired of Putin's stupid face and want to show his paranoid underground transport."" In a follow-up video call, he said he is speaking up to ""bring closer the end of the regime.""  Kimmage, the former State Department official, said that Putin's careful preparations more than a decade ago indicate how long his mind has been focussed on the possibility of existential conflict with the West.  ""With the war in Ukraine,"" Kimmage said, ""there's speechmaking, there's propaganda, there's exaggeration — there's this performative aspect that plays to Russia's domestic politics. But this is also deadly real. Putin perceives himself as being engaged in a confrontation with the West. The nuclear dimension is an important part of that. He knows he is standing on top of a volcano. He doesn't seem to be so psychopathic as to initiate a nuclear conflict — he has grandchildren — but he's been standing on that edge for a very long time. These tunnels, this bunker, is a part of that.""  Mattathias Schwartz is Insider's chief national security correspondent. He can be reached by email at schwartz79@protonmail.com.

A House of God, a Georgian house, a Victorian estate and now a museum, art gallery and gardens.  It wasn’t always like that.    The medieval Abbey was a very rich and powerful place and so it attracted the attention of those with less spiritual motives. Here was an institution with extensive resources and potential patronage opportunities. It could dispense benefices, employ people and grant leases on lands and tithes.    Torre Abbey was big business, so who was in charge mattered. And disputes over control could lead to kidnap and murder.  In 1345 Abbot Simon de Plympton died and the canons had to appoint a new head. Richard de Cotelford was elected but the father-abbot refused to confirm the election. Instead he appointed John Gras. Although Richard’s family were landholders in South Brent, John Gras was better connected. This was a common reason for the overturning of elections by outside interests.  John Gras ruled for three and a half years, dying in early 1349, possibly a victim of the Black Death that ravaged the South West. His successor, John de Berkadone, was confirmed in May 1349.    However, Richard de Cotelford had always complained that he had been cheated out of his rightful position. He continued to press his claim and in November 1349 won his case, receiving confirmation from the exiled bishop of Porto.  Two years later in August 1351, Richard returned to England from Avignon, going first to Westminster to receive royal support. He then journeyed to Torre, expecting when he arrived to be welcomed by the appreciative abbots and local landowners. To support his legitimate claim, he was accompanied by Roger de Queryngdon, the bearer of the King’s protection. That was the idea, anyway.    However, the return of Richard hadn’t gone down well with those who had installed John de Berkadone a couple of years earlier and who had presumably done quite well out of the appointment.    On 6 November 1351 it was recorded that “a large confederacy of disturbers of the peace, men at arms, and others purpose to come to the abbey and the granges, manors, and other places annexed to the abbey and consume and waste the goods and things therein.‟  Two weeks later, on 20 November, a commission was appointed to investigate this group of men who “broke by night his close, church and treasury at Torre Moun, co. Devon, carried away his goods and assaulted his men and servants, whereby he lost their service for a great time.”  It named a number of those involved in this attack who, it was disclosed, came from Totnes, West Devon, Dartington, Ashburton, and Dartmouth, alongside “many others‟.    Around this time Richard and Roger de Queryngdon were kidnapped and murdered.  It looks like the objective was to remove Richard from his leadership of the Abbey.  The attackers came from the lower gentry and townsmen of South Devon and it seems most likely that the assassins were sent on their violent mission by Geoffrey Gras. Geoffrey was the kinsman of the deceased abbot John Gras whose election Richard had overturned. John de Berkadone was then reinstated as abbot.  Effectively, Geoffrey Gras had kidnapped and killed Richard de Cotelford, along with the King’s messenger, to ensure his continued influence at Torre Abbey.  An attack on any Christian abbey was, of course, a serious breach of the peace. The assassination of a senior member of the clergy, disrespect to the King’s protection, and the kidnapping and murder of his messenger were also great offences.  However, even though the gang were named in the commission, they appear not to have suffered any punishment and Geoffrey Gras was pardoned.  Gras and his family remained closely connected to the Abbey even after he had kidnapped and slain their elected leader. The white-cassocked canons seem to be willing to let the attack be forgotten. Or perhaps they just didn’t have any choice in the matter.  ‘Torquay: A Social History’ by local author Kevin Dixon is available for £10 from Artizan Gallery, Lucius Street, Torquay, or:    https://www.art-hub.co.uk/product-page/torquay-a-social-history-by-kevin-dixon"

In the show, Woody Harrelson plays the gruff and enigmatic Hunt alongside Justin Theroux as a comically mustached Liddy.

Avengers assemble! Captain Marvel has just put together a new incarnation of Earth’s Mightiest Heroes. The latest Avengers roster includes Captain Marvel, Captain America (Sam Wilson), Iron Man, Vision, Scarlet Witch, Black Panther, and Thor. But is there room in their lineup for another powerhouse?  Avengers #1 (written by Jed MacKay and penciled by C.F. Villa) ends with the surprise arrival of Kang. But the time traveling conqueror doesn’t want to attack the Avengers, he wants to warn them. What’s going on?  Kang, ally or enemy?  The Avengers are taking a moment to reset. After the events of Jason Aaron’s Avengers Assemble storyline, the group has decided to temporarily disband. This has allowed the team to reassess their place in the world so they could forge a new beginning. Carol Danvers is named team chairperson, and most of Avengers #1 involves her putting together the new roster.  As Captain Marvel explains, this new iteration of the Avengers will get back to the core of what made the team inspiring in the first place. “The Avengers aren’t cops. Or, at least, we shouldn’t be. That doesn’t work, that just gets us into civil wars,” Carol tells Iron Man. “The Avengers are firefighters. We’re the ones who fly into the blaze, whatever it is.”  The new Avengers then battle Terminus, a behemoth who enjoys destroying planets. During the battle, Scarlet Witch casts a powerful spell, which causes a huge surge of energy. Captain Marvel then finds herself displaced in Null-Time, the space between time. It’s unknown if this was a result of Wanda’s spell or other forces.  As Captain Marvel gathers her bearings, she’s surprised to find herself face to face with Kang. However, the Avengers’ enemy has seen better days. The deadly villain is severely wounded and missing most of his armor. “You’ve come to my deathbed Carol Danvers. We must speak. I have a warning for you,” Kang weakly says.  Why is Kang wounded?  Kang the Conqueror has a reputation for being one of Marvel’s most fearsome villains, so the sight of him humbled and broken might be a bit surprising. However, you wouldn’t be surprised if you read Timeless #1 (2023). The one-shot followed Kang as he searched the timeline for something called the Missing Moment. As you have probably gathered, the search didn’t go so well. The thing about searching for mythical items is that you usually find yourself clashing with others.  A group known as the Twilight Court sought the Missing Moment for their master, a villain named Myrddin. It wasn’t long before their paths crossed, and Kang was in for a world of hurt. Myrddin stabbed Kang through the chest, critically wounding the time tyrant. In a last-ditch effort for survival, Kang transported himself to Null-Time. “If I’m to thwart Myrddin, even from beyond the grave, then I will require heroes of my own,” Kang says.  So, Kang is looking for heroes, and now he’s face to face with Captain Marvel. She said that her new Avengers would rush into the blaze to save people, but does that include madmen like Kang?  Will Kang join the Avengers? What’s next for the villainous conqueror?  Will this lead to Kang joining the Avengers, or destroying them? Popverse doesn’t have a time machine, but we can look at comic solicitations for a hint on what the future might hold. Avengers #2 goes on sale June 21, and the solicitation states, “The Avengers find themselves with a rare gift – foreknowledge of the dangers coming their way in the form of the deadly TRIBULATION EVENTS. But can this information be trusted? And can even Earth’s Mightiest Heroes triumph in the face of cascading disaster?”  Avengers #3 goes on sale July 26, and the solicitation states, “The first Tribulation Event strikes the Earth! The Avengers fly into the action as the Ashen Combine – a collection of the Multiverse’s greatest monsters – descend from the Impossible City to follow their respective appetites. Cityslayers all, pursuing the assassination of metropolitan areas for sport!”  Neither solicitation says anything about Kang, but they don’t have to. The copy makes it clear that the Avengers will be going on Kang’s quest to stop Myrddin, which includes making their way through the Tribulation Events. As established in Timeless #1, Tribulation Events are fixed moments in history. You cannot find the Missing Moment without going through the Tribulation Events, and only heroes can access them. This is why Myrddin formed the Twilight Court, as he wasn’t a hero.  There is a lot we still don’t know about the nature of the Missing Moment, but it appears that it will be deadly in the wrong hands. Whether the Avengers trust Kang or not, it’s in their best interest to stop Myrddin from obtaining the Missing Moment. And then what? Will Kang betray the Avengers once his rival is out of the way? Is he just using them to get the Missing Moment for himself? Probably.  However, Kang might surprise us. Plenty of reformed villains have become central parts of the Avengers’ roster, including Hawkeye, Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch, and Black Widow. Maybe Jed MacKay has a surprise up his sleeve, with plans for a Kang redemption arc.  However, the difference is those reformed villains wanted to change.

Making Kang a hero in the comics while he’s a villain onscreen might hurt some of that corporate synergy Marvel loves so much.

Speaking to Reuters on the sidelines of the Geneva Summit for Human Rights and Democracy, Evgenia Kara-Murza said her husband’s repeated requests to speak to his three children – aged 11, 14 and 17 – were denied given that they now live in the United States.  “Vladimir very much misses his kids, his family, and he’s devastated that he has not been able to talk to us in over a year,” Evgenia Kara-Murza said on Wednesday. “And the authorities know that. They’re just using it as a psychological torture against him.”  Russia’s Federal Penitentiary Service did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Convicted last month of treason and other offences for publicly condemning Russia’s leadership and the war in Ukraine, Vladimir Kara-Murza received the harshest sentence of its kind since the February 2022 invasion.  He was detained in April last year, hours after CNN broadcast an interview in which he said Russia was being run by a “regime of murderers”.  State prosecutors accused the 41-year-old of treason, among other offences, and of discrediting the Russian military by spreading “knowingly false information” about its conduct in what Moscow calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine.  Vladimir Kara-Murza, who holds Russian and British passports, was a close associate of Boris Nemtsov, an opposition figure assassinated near the Kremlin in 2015. He continued to speak out against President Vladimir Putin.  “Had I tried to convince him to give up his fight, I would have betrayed him,” Evgenia Kara-Murza said.  ‘PERSONAL ENEMY’  Evgenia Kara-Murza said her husband’s successful lobbying of foreign governments and institutions to impose sanctions on Russia and individual Russians for human rights violations had made him a “personal enemy” of the Kremlin.  “Dictatorships all over the world are very much afraid of clear, strong voices that refuse to be intimidated. And Vladimir’s voice is one such voice.”  Despite not being able to speak to him, his children have grown up being acutely aware of the perils of being an opposition figure in Russia.  They witnessed their father slip into comas after poisonings in 2015 and 2017 that left him with a serious nerve disorder called polyneuropathy. Russian authorities denied any involvement.  “Their father was first poisoned when our oldest was nine,” Evgenia Kara-Murza said. “She’s now 17. That’s half of her life she spent knowing that her father was being targeted again and again and again.”  (Reporting by Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber; Editing by Alex Richardson)"

This lone photo bears the testimony of the nation’s pride and pain.  In the photograph, it is shown that how Sheikh Hasina, the luckless daughter of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, found their Dhanmondi-32 house in Dhaka locked upon her return to country on May 17, 1981 ending her six-year in exile. Her entry into their house was subject to permission from the military authority.  house was under the army authority until June 10, 1981. Military ruler Ziaur Rahman didn’t allow Sheikh Hasina or any member of Bangabandhu family to enter the house till his death.  Consequently, on the day of her return, Sheikh Hasina had to arrange prayer session on the road outside the house. It was a sheer cruelty and flagrant violation of human rights. She couldn’t seek justice for the brutal killing of her father and family members due to Indemnity Act passed in the parliament in a bid to protect the killers permanently. Moreover, the homeless daughter of Bangabandhu was barred from entering her only abode in Dhaka.  Now, numerous human rights activists and organisations are seen protesting different incidents accusing the government’s various bodies of violating human rights but during that time, they didn’t show minimum sympathy to Bangabandhu’s daughters. These ‘self declared human rights defenders’ had turned their eyes blind and remained mum in this regard.  A few days later, the house constructed on loan from the House Building Finance Corporation (HBFC) was auctioned as the installments of around Tk 12,000 were not paid. Sheikh Hasina had paid the money to get the house back.  The Dhanmondi-32 house was not merely a residence of a national leader. Since Bangabandhu and his family members had started living in the house on October 1, 1961, it turned into the centre of Bangalees’ nationalistic struggle. Bangabandhu took all policy decisions of Awami League from the drawing room of this house after discussing with his colleagues. He gave all instructions to the mass people gathered in front of the house through a hand mike from its balcony.  This house is a national asset and it cannot be compared to any structure. Feeling the historic importance of the house, Bangabandhus’s two daughters declared that this house would be turned into a museum.  Despite having no shelter in the city, they made the house as ‘Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Memorial Museum’, which reminds Bangalees of their most proud moments and painful chapter of national life, so that they can get inspiration to uphold the spirit of independence and take lessons to turn around from the most difficult situation in life."

Example video title will go here for this video  MEMPHIS, Tenn. — As Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month continues, the Chinese community is working to chronicle and preserve its 150 year history in Memphis.  “Our Memphis history starts in 1873,” said Emmi Dunn, Secretary at the Chinese Historical Society of Memphis and the Mid-South.  Dunn has been researching the history of the Chinese community, and says a laundry ad in a newspaper was the first indication of when Chinese immigrants first made their way to Memphis. Chinese immigrants likely made their way to the Mid-South after work completed on the transcontinental railroad according to Dunn.  “They were still building railroads in the South and Texas, so lots of Chinese came down here,” said Dunn.  Several immigrants began opening laundromats because it did not require a lot of money to do so. The first Chinese store opened in 1880, the first restaurant opened in 1894, several in and around Beale Street.  “They have a much more diverse customer base. During segregation time, that’s where black people can get some service,” said Jinliang Cai, President of the Chinese Historical Society of Memphis and the Mid-South.  At one point, so many Chinese business were on Beale Street, a local newspaper referred to that part as “Chinatown.”  “It consisted of a few stores, grocery stores, cafes and laundries,” said Dunn, “It was not a Chinatown per se as you would think of in San Francisco or New York.”  The Chinese business influence reached its height in the 1920s and 30s. Business began to leave the area over time for different reasons, including after Dr. Martin Luther King’s assassination. Laundromats eventually began to disappear after washing machine’s became automated.  “Eventually really the downtown started to decline after that, and really it started to trickle to the suburbs,” said Cai.  Most businesses only stayed open for a couple of years on Beale Street. The Chop Suey Cafe stayed open for close to 50 years, but closed its doors in 1967. This is why the Chinese Historical Society of Memphis and the Mid-South are trying to preserve that history and stories just like it. A photo exhibit is planned for later this month to be displayed at the Chinese Community Center, and at the Memphis Library in October."

In 1965, she spent more time than ever out of the house, working for the movement, beginning in March with a series of Freedom Concerts on the West Coast. In April, she traveled to Detroit for a dinner honoring and raising money for Rosa Parks, who had struggled to find work, first in Montgomery and later in Detroit, and who had suffered deteriorating health.  In May, Coretta King spoke at a gathering of the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom in Chicago. And on June 8, she was the only woman to speak at an anti–Vietnam War rally attended by more than fifteen thousand people at Madison Square Garden in New York City.  Earlier that year, at an SCLC retreat, Martin had asked Coretta to speak about Vietnam and whether the organization had a responsibility to take a stand against the war. “I talked about how it would continue to drain resources from education, housing, health, and other badly needed social programs,” she recalled. “I said, ‘Why do you think we got the Nobel Prize? It was not just for civil rights . . . Peace and justice are indivisible.’ ”  It was Coretta’s passion for activism that had first attracted Martin, back in 1952, when she had been enrolled at the New England Conservatory of Music and he had been pursuing his doctorate at Boston University. On their first date, they had discussed the merits of capitalism versus communism. He explained that he intended to devote himself to the fight for racial justice. Coretta, having attended the progressive and integrated Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, thought she would have the edge on this well-bred young man when it came to passion for social reform. She was pleasantly surprised to find that he seemed determined to fight racial discrimination, even if he was not yet sure how to do it.  King was attracted to Coretta in no small part because her experience as an activist exceeded his own. Thirteen years later, however, she expressed frustration with her limited role in the civil rights movement.  “My husband feels it important that one parent remain at home to give them [the children] security,” she told a reporter in Seattle. “But I would like to make a more complete witness by marching, and, if necessary, going to jail.”  Martin, on the other hand, almost never spent time home alone with the children when Coretta traveled. Instead, the Kings relied on friends and family to watch Yolanda, Martin, Dexter, and Bernice. In a memoir written years later, Coretta recalled a conversation in which she told Martin she wanted to take a more active role in the movement:  During one exchange, he told me, “You see, I am called [by God], and you aren’t.”  I responded, “I have always felt that I have a call on my life, too. “I’ve been called by God, too, to do something [. . .]”  Still not convinced, Martin turned to me and said, “Well, somebody has to take care of the kids.”  “No problem,” I said. “I will do that.”  Looking a bit crushed, he asked, “You aren’t totally happy being my wife and the mother of my children, are you?”  “I love being your wife and the mother of your children,” I said. “But if that’s all I am to do, I’ll go crazy.”  During a 1965 television interview conducted at his home, King was asked if he had educated his wife on matters of activism. “Well, it may have been the other way around,” he said. “I think at many points she educated me. When I met her, she was very concerned about all the things we are trying to do now. . . I wish I could say to satisfy my masculine ego that I led her down this path, but I must say we went down together, because she was as actively involved when we met as she is now.”  James Karales for Look magazine / Library of Congress King at home with family, 563 Johnson Avenue, Atlanta, fall 1962  The Feminine Mystique, written by Betty Friedan, had been published in 1963 and remained enormously popular in 1965, describing the widespread dissatisfaction among American women, and encouraging them to declare: “I want something more than my husband and my children and my home.” At one point in 1965, Coretta began working on an essay for the first issue of a magazine called New Lady, a publication that billed itself as “the Negro woman’s guide to a new way of life.” By the time she finished, the article ran to thirteen pages of text and photos. Coretta must have been proud of it because she mailed a copy to Rosa Parks. “Women have been the backbone of the whole civil rights movement,” Coretta wrote in the article. “Women have . . . made it possible for the movement to be a mass movement.” It was a simple fact, but nevertheless an overlooked one.  In Montgomery, Parks had sparked the bus boycott and Jo Ann Robinson and the Women’s Political Council had launched it. Aurelia Browder, Claudette Colvin, Susie McDonald, and Mary Louise Smith had served as plaintiffs in the federal lawsuit that led to the Supreme Court decision that desegregated the city’s buses. Ella Baker had long served as one of the movement’s best organizers. Diane Nash had helped initiate the Freedom Rides and cofounded SNCC. Septima Clark and Fannie Lou Hamer had led the push for voter registration in much of the Deep South. And then there were countless women such as Coretta Scott King and Juanita Abernathy who endured many of the same perils as their husbands while receiving little credit for their work, work that included not only marching and organizing but also taking care of children, filling in for their husbands, and advising their spouses on matters of strategy, leadership, and politics. In addition to the other challenges, Coretta Scott King ran her household on a modest budget, because her husband insisted that most of the income from his speeches and writings go to the SCLC.  In her article for New Lady, Coretta offered her clearest explanation of how she navigated a path that left many ambitious women of the 1960s feeling lost and angry. Over and over, she returned to the themes of compromise and perseverance. She began: “While my husband was being prepared for the job that he is doing, I feel that I was being prepared also to be the helpmate… I feel very strongly that it was meant to be this way.”  At Antioch College, as she recalled in the article, she had insisted on doing her student teaching in the Yellow Springs Public Schools, along with her white classmates. But the Yellow Springs schools were segregated, and Antioch officials wanted her to travel nine miles to an integrated school in Xenia, Ohio. She “felt like crying” when her teachers and classmates refused to support her. “Then I thought, ‘I am a Negro and I am going to be a Negro the rest of my life. I just can’t let this kind of thing get me down . . . I’ll have to accept this.’ . . . So I made the compromise,” she wrote.  She accepted even worse, according to Hosea Williams, who said that he witnessed King’s cruel treatment of Coretta on more than one occasion. “ ‘Shut up and go ahead in the back room!’ ” Williams said he heard Martin yell at Coretta. “She would get up quietly and go on back. Martin had told her many times.”  Williams was a frequent critic of Coretta, but if the men in the SCLC dismissed King’s wife, the women admired her. They saw a woman fighting to balance her dedication to her family and her causes. Xernona Clayton, an SCLC staff member from Atlanta who traveled at times with Coretta, said she was always impressed by Coretta’s calm determination. For Coretta to leave Atlanta and perform a concert, she not only had to rehearse, arrange her travel, and promote her appearances but also had to make sure the children would be cared for in her absence. Before leaving, she would type a list of meals for the week, including desserts. Even when she was on the road, without consulting notes or a calendar, Coretta knew when the children had doctors’ appointments, piano lessons, and haircuts, Clayton said, and Coretta checked in frequently to make sure nothing was forgotten.  “Coretta Scott King was a disciplinarian,” wrote her son Dexter, “took no guff from hers or any others. Froze you with a look.”  Carole Hoover, another SCLC staff member, said it was clear that Dr. King respected and relied on his wife’s opinion when it came to high-level questions of strategy. “She was very much engaged with those things that were important to him,” Hoover said. “He genuinely valued her thinking.” People in the office heard rumors about King’s infidelity, and specifically about his relationship with Dorothy Cotton. “That rumor floated several times,” Hoover said. “I don’t think Coretta ever bought into that.”  But others in the SCLC did buy into it. When King returned to Atlanta from one of his frequent trips, he usually went to Cotton’s home before going to his own house, said Stoney Cooks, an SCLC staff member. It was understood within the organization that the relationship had been going on for years. “Only the people who were very close to him even knew about it,” Cooks said, and Cotton “didn’t flaunt it.”  Nevertheless, the women of the SCLC saw Coretta and Dr. King as powerful partners, said Edwina Smith Moss. “They didn’t profess to be perfect, and Coretta was such an asset to Dr. King,” Moss recalled. “She was strong, and she came out of the South . . . If Dr. King ever wanted to quit, she wouldn’t have let him. She was not fearful. If she had been, it would’ve shown . . . She understood the FBI wanted to break them up . . . Coretta had steel. Coretta had a sense of the movement. You couldn’t have done that without a real sense of the movement. She was the power behind the throne . . . She was not the person to break. If she was going to have a battle, it was going to be with Dr. King, and it was not going to be in public . . .”  “It is a great temptation,” Coretta wrote, “to demand more of my husband’s attention. We women are like that. But I have had to realize that he belongs to the world and therefore cannot be the same kind of husband and father that he would like to be.” Doing her part for the cause of freedom, she said, included explaining to the children why their father went to jail and why he wasn’t home as much as other fathers and why, sometimes, he didn’t come home when the family expected him. “I have considered my own role very important from the beginning,” she wrote.  The assassination of President Kennedy frightened her, Coretta wrote. The assassination of Malcolm X frightened her more. She felt stuck, “weak and depressed,” after Malcolm’s death. She reminded herself, she wrote, that she and her husband and all humans were coworkers with God, building a world of peace and love. As she concluded in her article: “When you decide to give yourself to a great cause, you must arrive at the point where no sacrifice is too great. This is the first demand that is made of us in our great struggle for civil rights. I shall stand with Martin Luther King, Jr., my husband, as he faces them.”  Throughout the spring and summer, King hustled from speech to speech, interview to interview, city to city, protest to protest, until August 6, 1965, when he arrived in Washington, D.C., to meet with President Johnson and witness Johnson’s signature of the Voting Rights Act. Joining King were Roy Wilkins, James Farmer, and Rosa Parks, among others. Coretta King watched the ceremony on television. She was home taking care of Marty and Dexter, who had both had their tonsils removed. Martin had been so busy that Coretta had never found time to tell him about the scheduled surgeries. It was one of the few occasions, she wrote years later, when she felt sorry for herself.  “I felt very supportive of his being there,” she wrote, “but I also had this feeling of being alone, of being entirely by myself.”  Later that day, outside the White House, five hundred people protested U.S. policies in Vietnam. King made no public comment on the anti-war demonstration. His focus was on the historic new law, which, he said, would “go a long way toward removing all the obstacles to the right to vote.”  It was, he told reporters, as he prepared to fly home to Atlanta, “a shining moment.”  Adapted from Eig’s biography King: A Life published by Farrar Straus & Giroux  Contact us at letters@time.com."

Most of what he did was espionage. With, you know, a little union-busting, as a treat. Still, he clinched the concept of a private detective outside the realm of the hired thug. Even though, yeah, Pinkerton agents are also hired thugs; just ask the person Wizards of the Coast sent Pinkertons after recently. But Allan Pinkerton did also thwart assassination plots against Lincoln before his inauguration, so that’s a net positive, at least?  In fact, the first fictional detective predates the public familiarity with Pinkerton. Charles Dickens created Mr. Nadgett in Martin Chuzzlewit, which I have not read on the grounds of hating Dickens and almost all of his works. Still, the golden era of pop culture fiction is the mid-twentieth century, definitely post-Pinkerton, and “private eye” is a phrase that gets used a lot. Whether it’s Sam Spade, James Rockford, or Kinsey Milhone, they’re all private eyes. And pop culture is full of them, of many varying types.  The first one to come to mind for most people is the hard-boiled. Your Sam Spade, your Philip Marlowe, your Mike Hammer. Tough men—they’re men—who drink a lot and are always on the verge of bankruptcy and generally have a secretary they sexually harass in some way. Probably there is a set of Venetian blinds in their office. They will almost certainly be shot at, if not actually shot, at least once in any given case. The bodies will just keep piling up.  At about the same time, we got a lot of Gentleman Detectives. (Also generally men.) Your Lord Peter Wimsey, your Hercule Poirot, your Nero Wolfe. Some of these were not officially set up as detectives and just kind of tripped into a lot of cases, but also there were some who had fancy apartments and were hired by expensive people. Nero Wolfe has a staff—enough so that he almost never leaves the brownstone. Though a lot of Gentleman Detectives were also globetrotters; how many countries did Hercule Poirot solve cases in?  Starting in about the ‘70s, you also got what is kind of the response to the two classic types. Jim Rockford, obviously—he’s hard-boiled, but in a more modern way. He’s got a bit of sensitivity. No secretary at all, because he can’t afford one, and he gets clients based on his ad in the phone book. It’s as though everyone realized there’s room for variety. You can have, say, a man in very short shorts who’s basically a rich man’s pool boy. You can have a man with crippling Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. You can have the man who’s slipping into the life of a fictional character.  Who, in fact, was created by a woman in-universe, because that’s an extension of where detectives could go. Nancy Drew isn’t the first of the female detective characters, but she’s a good start. But as late as 1982, Laura Holt invented a male boss because no one wanted to hire a woman. (Which the first Enola Holmes book plays with, I discovered this week.) Yes, there’s Miss Marple, who’s kind of in the Gentleman Detective range—the Little Old Lady equivalent, along with Jessica Fletcher and others. Phryne Fisher, who predates the hard-boiled men on the timeline, inasmuch as she’s in the ‘20s, but who is a modern addition to the genre.  And, of course, there’s more than just white dudes. You’ve got Easy Rawlins, John Shaft, and Precious Ramotswe. And all of those are just in the English-speaking world; if you expand out of that, you’ve got dozens, if not hundreds. The private detective has a lot of choices. From Adrian Monk to Veronica Mars and beyond. You’ve got Harry Dresden, private detective/wizard. You’ve got Jessica Jones, private detective/superhero. Dirk Gently, private detective/whatever he needs to be on a given day. Fiction’s full of them, and they just keep going. Ask Benoit Blanc.

Polls released by major Israeli channels after the ceasefire, which was signed on Saturday night, prove beyond doubt the operation achieved its main goal from the government’s perspective: the popularity of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition was on the rise.  Netanyahu was trailing in polls to his opposition rivals days before the bombing campaign, dubbed “Operation Shield and Arrow”, was launched on 9 May with a series of overnight assassinations.  Five days of Gaza bleeding - in which 33 Palestinians, including six children, were killed - and the ongoing bleeding of Netanyahu’s coalition was miraculously cured. Mission accomplished.  Netanyahu has restored his image as “Mr Security” - not the ailing prime minister accused of leading his country into a dictatorship with his government’s controversial judicial overhaul plan.  Stay informed with MEE's newsletters Sign up to get the latest alerts, insights and analysis, starting with Turkey Unpacked  “The only achievement of this military operation is the security of Netanyahu’s coalition,” Zehava Gal-On, former head of the leftist Meretz party, told Middle East Eye.  'In the absence of any strategy, all Israelis can expect is more rounds of violence with shorter breaks between them' - Daniel Rothschild, head of Israeli think tank  Strangely enough, this miraculous recovery has nothing to do with how Israelis feel about the outcome of the five-day assault.  A poll conducted by Channel 12 a day after the ceasefire showed that 42 percent of respondents believed the operation strengthened Israeli deterrence.  Around 44 percent believed it made no difference and five percent thought it made it worse.  This indifference is echoed by politicians on both sides of the spectrum.  Members of the coalition, both from Netayhu’s Likud party and his allies in the far-right Religious Zionism party, sound unhappy with how the operation ended. They wanted more.  The same goes for Avigdor Lieberman, leader of the opposition right-wing Yisrael Beytenu party, who blamed Netanyahu for creating a “Hezbollah in the south” by not attacking Hamas, the Palestinian group which rules over Gaza.  On the left, politicians repeated the same knee-jerk reaction of non-judgmental support for the attacks.  Labor MP Efrat Rayten, for example, was more worried about how it was going to be “difficult to explain” the images of children killed in Israel’s air strikes, rather than questioning the purpose behind the bloodshed.  No vision for Gaza  In Israel, the very same people who doubt the merit and logic of the operation once it ends are the ones who support it as it unfolds - and politically reward Netanyahu for launching it.  And there’s very little reasonable explanation behind this.  Perhaps it’s not fair to expect reason from people who follow a leadership that lacks any meaningful logical or moral considerations.  Gaza: How this 85-year-old Palestinian experienced two Nakbas Read More »  After all, what do you expect of a military and political establishment that refers to the killing of Palestinian children as “collateral damage”?  But many in Israel have learned that after almost 20 years of 15 futile “operations”, a blockade, mass killings, “targeted eliminations,” and the destruction of Gaza - along with thousands of rockets fired into Israel’s south and centre in response - this is not the answer.  However, no one offers an alternative, and more bloodshed seems to be the only option.  Those same people who support the operation know that the next one is just around the corner. They know that the Islamic Jihad “senior leaders” that Israel assassinated will be replaced quickly.  “In the absence of any strategy, all Israelis can expect is more rounds of violence with shorter breaks between them,” said Daniel Rothschild, head of the Institute for Policy and Strategy think tank and former military general.  “As long as Netanyahu applies his tactical approach of divide and rule between Palestinian Authority (PA) in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza - effectively weakening one and strengthening the other - and unless they come up with a holistic strategy that includes both the West Bank and Gaza, we are doomed to have more tactical rounds coming one after another,” Rothschild told MEE.  People react following an Israeli air strike in Beit Lahia in the northern Gaza Strip, on 13 May 2023 (NurPhoto via Reuters)  His views are shared by Yair Golan, the Israeli military's former deputy chief of staff and now a politician with the left-wing Meretz party.  “What have we gained from this operation? Nothing,” Golan told MEE two days into the ceasefire.  Since Israel unilaterally “disengaged” from Gaza in 2005, pulling out troops and settlements that were in the strip since it was occupied in 1967, little has changed in the strip, he added.  The military presence was replaced by an air, land and sea blockade, which turned the densely populated enclave into the largest “open-air prison”, according to human rights groups.  The military also launched repeated operations in Gaza from 2006 onwards, killing more than 6,000 Palestinians in less than two decades.  Under Netanyahu’s leadership, this policy has meant that Israel is effectively working against its interests by weakening the PA and strengthening Hamas, Golan argued, keeping the region ""stuck in an endless confrontation"".  The deterrence equation  The declared aim of the latest assault was the Islamic Jihad, the second biggest armed group in Gaza behind Hamas.  This is the third time since 2019 that the group has been singled out in attacks by Israel in which Hamas was not targeted.  Despite widespread speculation, Hamas - which has a much bigger arsenal than the Islamic Jihad - did not publicly confirm if they joined other armed groups in launching retaliatory rockets at Israel.  During a visit two days after the assault to Ashkelon, one of the cities that came under heavy rocket fire, Netanyahu hailed the success of the operation.  He said it ""changed the deterrence equation"" with armed groups in Gaza - an assertion dismissed by Golan.  ""Once again, we just bought time, limited time. How long?"" he asked, arguing that the question on whether Hamas joined the fighting or not was irrelevant.  “Hamas was in no rush to reach a ceasefire. They offered the Islamic Jihad moral support and probably arms and weapons as well,"" he explained.  Cracks in the protests?  Another collateral damage of the five days of bloodshed in Gaza might be the months-long mass protest movement against Netanyahu's “regime change”.  Since January, hundreds of thousands of Israelis have been rallying weekly against a judicial overhaul proposal presented by the government which critics say will weaken the country's judiciary.  In late March, Netanyahu postponed the plan amid widespread strikes and protests. He said he wanted to give room for talks with the opposition in the hopes of reaching a consensus regarding the plan.  No progress has been made in the discussions so far, and the issue is expected to come back to the fore of Israeli politics by the end of May once the state budget is passed.  Gaza: Israel's unity over new aggression won't last Read More »  The common struggle against what many views as a pending dictatorship seemed to unite Israelis otherwise divided by many schisms in the relentless demonstrations from January until now.  But that might change after the Gaza assault.  One of the leading groups in the demonstrations, Brothers in Arms, a grouping of reservists, was quick to publish a poster in support of the “brothers in arms” bombing Gaza - a statement that drew the ire of others in the protests movement.  Another dominant protest group, Black Flags, decided to cancel the weekly demonstration last Saturday as the fighting was still unfolding, an announcement ignored by some protesters who showed up to the rallies anyway.  These could be small cracks in the thin armour of Israeli opposition solidarity that can be easily fixed. Or they could be the beginning of a crisis: war with Palestinians could see many in the opposition camp rally around national ""defence"" and break the momentum of protests.  For Netanyahu's government, this could be the big collateral benefit of his bombing campaign."

By TeeJay Small |  Not all studios can tout the seemingly endless budget of Marvel or Star Wars projects, despite sharing intellectual property with some of the biggest names in modern media. For the CW network, series such as The Flash and Stargirl have long been criticized for their low CGI budget, failing to live up to the standards of their box office blockbuster counterparts such as Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice and Justice League. According to a recent write-up in The Hollywood Reporter, The CW’s latest effort to bring Gotham City to life, Gotham Knights, has the lowest budget of any DC series ever produced by the network and still may face cancellation.  As the ongoing Writers Guild of America strike begins to loom over the industry, many networks are looking to cut costs. For the CW, this means gutting a number of their scripted series and pivoting to more unscripted content, with shows like The Winchesters and Kung Fu each getting the axe this past week. Despite touting such incredibly low budgeting numbers to produce, Gotham Knights seems to be next on the chopping block, as the series continues to bring in less viewing traffic than its sister series Superman and Lois.  Gotham Knights centers around a socio-political firestorm kicked off by the aftermath of Batman‘s untimely death. Without the Dark Knight himself to instill fear in the hearts of the city’s most dangerous felons, the city quickly devolves into chaos, leaving District Attorney Harvey Dent and a band of mismatched fugitives to attempt to keep the city from boiling over while investigating the true nature of Bruce Wayne’s assassination. The series is currently in the final weeks of airing its first season, with the last two episodes set to hit the small screen on Tuesday, May 23, and Tuesday, May 30, respectively.  Despite this news being reported to The Hollywood Reporter from a close source, many fans have already been made aware of the staggeringly low budget for Gotham Knights simply by watching the show. A tertiary glance at fan engagement on a number of online platforms such as Twitter and Instagram reveals dozens, potentially hundreds of critiques of the show’s costuming, props, and failure to secure more convincing shooting locations. While most television shows utilize movie magic to cover up their shortcomings, it seems that Gotham Knights lacks the budget to do even that.  Gotham Knights seems to serve as a cautionary tale for networks like The CW amid growing concerns that other entertainment unions, such as the Directors Guild and IATSE, may soon engage in a strike as well, proving the age-old adage that “you get what you pay for.” By seemingly trying to save money by skimping on production costs and overall quality, the network has actually lost money by failing to entice viewers to flock to the show.  If Gotham Knights does wind up getting canceled in the coming weeks, it surely speaks more to studio failure than it does to the general public’s gauged interest in Batman and Batman-adjacent projects. Though film outings such as Matt Reeves’ Batman and Todd Phillips’ Joker sport significantly higher budgets than the average CW television show, both films serve as contemporary examples that stories told in the setting of Gotham can and will attract huge viewing numbers if you’re willing to put in the time, effort, and money to make them worth exploring."

Orlandi’s case recently was popularized by the Netflix series “Vatican Girl,” and most observers credit the flurry of new investigations, at least in part, to the heightened public interest created by the documentary.  The chief prosecutor of Rome, roughly equivalent to a district attorney in the United States, announced the new investigation this week. It will be the third such probe by the Roman procurator’s office in the 40 years since Orlandi disappeared. The first unfolded between 1983 and 1997, and the second from 2008 to 2015.  That second investigation was closed in 2015 by the chief prosecutor of Rome at the time, a veteran Italian jurist named Giuseppe Pignatone, who today serves as the president of the civil tribunal of the Vatican City State.  The Italian news agency Ansa reported Tuesday that the Vatican’s Promoter of Justice, Alessandro Diddi, has turned over files from his investigation to Stefano Luciani, the official in the Rome procurator’s office now responsible for the new Orlandi review.  Pietro Orlandi, the brother of Emanuela who’s devoted his life to the search for the truth about his sister’s disappearance, told reporters the Vatican’s cooperation with the Roman probe is a departure from the past.  “It’s positive that the Roman procurator has acquired the acts from the Vatican, because for the first time there will be collaboration, always denied in the past, between the Holy See and the [Italian justice system],” he said.  That’s a charge recently echoed by Giancarlo Capaldo, a retired Roman official who led the last investigation of the Orlandi case that was closed in 2015. In April, Capaldo told an Italian television program that in his experience there had been “no cooperation by Vatican with investigations of Italian magistrates.”  Among other things, Capaldo has claimed that in 2012 officials of the Vatican gendarmes offered to help identify Orlandi’s remains in exchange for assistance with removing the body of a mob boss who’d been entombed in a Roman basilica. Both officials involved have denied that claim, suggesting Capaldo misunderstood their intent.  The Vatican has always rejected charges of stonewalling investigations into the Orlandi case. In a 2012 statement from then-Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi, he insisted the Vatican has cooperated with Italian authorities from the start.  The 40th anniversary of Orlandi’s disappearance will fall next month, on June 22.  Veteran Italian journalist Fabrizio Peronaci, writing in Corriere della Sera, has suggested that the new probe of the Orlandi case by the procurator’s office could be combined with one already underway into the January 1984 murder of Katy Skerl, a 17-year-old girl at the time whose body was discovered in the countryside outside Grottaferrata, a small community southeast of Rome.  Over the years, some theorists have linked Skerl’s murder to the Orlandi case, noting, among other things, that Skerl was a classmate in a Roman high school of Snejna Vassilev, the daughter of one of three Bulgarian functionaries in Rome initially accused of complicity in the 1981 assassination attempt against Pope John Paul II.  Marco Accetti, a 67-year-old Roman photographer whose claims to have played a key role in the Orlandi affair have generated both interest and skepticism over the years, has asserted Skerl was killed on the order of a faction in the Vatican, opposed to the group which orchestrated the kidnapping of Orlandi, as part of an internal power struggle. To date, however, he’s offered no proof.  The Italian Chamber of Deputies voted overwhelmingly in March to authorize an inquest on behalf of parliament, and it seemed at the time the Senate would follow suit. Momentum stalled, however, after Pietro Orlandi went on Italian TV to play an audio recording of an ex-Roman mobster accusing the late Pope John Paul II of conniving in a pedophile ring in the Vatican, and suggesting that Emanuela Orlandi might have been killed to cover it up.  Those suggestions caused a furor, with Pope Francis twice publicly rejecting the charges against his predecessor. Key members of the senate have either withdrawn or modified their support for a probe in the wake of the controversy, with a vote now not expected until June at the earliest, and possibly after the summer."

Simmons, Prairie View A&M University’s eighth president, still remembers when Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee, on April 4, 1968. The news was a shock and a turning point for her. Facing challenges and difficulties as a college student herself at an HBCU decades ago, she shared about wanting to quit.  The death of MLK, however, woke her up.  “I felt unworthy to complain about picayune inconveniences when one so dedicated to making the world better for me was willing to give his life,” Dr. Simmons shared at the PVAMU’s 141st Spring Commencement Convocation on May 13. “So, I renewed my commitment to do what I could in my turn to make a better world.”  Simmons, immediate past president of PVAMU, returned to campus Saturday morning to give an impassioned speech to over 1,000 candidates for graduation. She acknowledged the “perils of the present moment” facing the graduating class who had already faced so much in the last few years alone.  “You leave this place at a moment when we’re all reckoning with unimaginable events that point to the confused state of the polity,” she told an enraptured audience. They are embarking into the world at a time when “hard-fought rights are being re-litigated.” She, nevertheless, encouraged them of their place and purpose in such a world: “I, for one, am confident that through your intelligence, your generosity, your open-mindedness, and your tolerance, you are prepared to play an important role in healing this nation.”  The 2023 class has overcome so much more than the typical college graduate of the past: a global pandemic, post-pandemic uncertainty, racial and social upheaval, economic instability, historic inflation, and an ongoing war in Ukraine, disrupting daily life worldwide.  At times emotional, tissues clutched in hand, Simmons, who stepped down earlier this spring, spoke about her undiminishing love for the University and her abiding faith in its students.  She highlighted their courage, endurance, and resilience: “Having come through this difficult period, your intelligence and your character have been tested. Your adaptability and fortitude have held up, and you stayed on the path to this achievement that we celebrate today.”  But above all, she urged them to remember. “Remember your freedom and the opportunities you enjoy have been purchased at a great cost. You owe to those who came before you and those who will follow you the obligation to pay attention, to speak up for access, and to do all you can to ensure that the freedoms we enjoy today are preserved and enhanced.”  Graduating, she said, is more than tossing your cap into the air on graduation day or hanging the framed diploma on the wall for all to see. “Don’t just do that. Remembering the burden of being educated, raise your voice. Raise it in defiance of those who’ve returned this country to 19th-century ideas and biases,” Simmons told the audience to thunderous applause.  Let the history of Prairie View further inspire you, she told them. “Let your conduct reflect the amazingly courageous history of this place.” Be true to yourself and hold strong to your values, not forgetting where you come from or who you are, Simmons advised. “Having studied here, you carry with you a stronger sense than most of what could be lost if we give in to the forces of darkness,” she said. “Those who benefit from the bravery of pioneers who removed barriers to freedom and opportunity do not get a free pass.”  Perhaps like the 1968 assassination of MLK, the 2020 murder of George Floyd may alight this next generation graduating into a precipice of a world on edge. Simmons charged graduates: “It is your turn to stand up, to insist on equal rights for all and defy those who would debase and violate the rights of others.”  Despite thundering storms delaying the ceremony and forcing it to be relocated to the University’s “Baby Dome,” 1,008 students walked the stage. And despite the challenges of the last four years, PVAMU awarded 837 bachelor’s, 153 master’s, and 18 doctorates. In addition, nearly one-third of undergraduate graduates identified themselves as first-generation college students.  This spring, PVAMU also produced its biggest class of doctoral candidates, thanks to various University measures, such as recruiting more highly qualified faculty for tenured and tenure-track and increasing tuition and fee support, James M. Palmer, provost and senior vice president for Academic Affairs, said in a press release.  This semester’s notable graduates include Jordan Poston, known as “Mr. Senior” from Dallas, who is headed to a Fortune Global 500 company. Another Spring 2023 grad, Zian Richmond, is a criminal justice major who graduated a year early and is headed to law school. Houston native Morgan Redd join the MD Anderson Cancer Center as an oncology stem cell transplant nurse.  Simmons did not doubt the graduating students’ abilities and potential to reach the highest heights. However, she called on them to go beyond professional goals and career aspirations to become the next frontiers who change the world.  “Those who came before you at Prairie View, who fought for your rights, now speak to you across the ages,” Simmons said. “Can you hear them?” The crowd of thousands sat in silence, listening. “Listen to their voices and contemplate their good works. This nourishment gives you the courage beyond what you thought you possessed.”  Where would we be today, she posed, without the dream of MLK and the courage of Rosa Parks? “You’ve been truly privileged to have the education that others’ efforts afforded you,” Simmons said. “Now, go. And make it mean something. Use your voice.”  By Christine Won  PVAMU Commencement Statistics (Spring 2023)  Number of degrees (by college/school)  College of Agriculture and Human Sciences: 58  School of Architecture: 59  Marvin D. and June Samuel Brailsford College of Arts and Sciences: 237  College of Business: 150  Whitlowe R.

Ghannouchi, who leads the Islamic democratic Ennahda party, was arrested last month. He denies the charges. The international community has condemned the arrest as another authoritarian act by Tunisia’s President Kais Saied.  A press statement from the US State Department last month said that the arrest of Ghannouchi and other political opponents represents “a troubling escalation by the Tunisian government against perceived opponents.”  Foreign Minister of Germany Annalena Baerbock told reporters that she was very concerned about Ghannouchi’s arrest and that the “democratic achievements in Tunisia since 2011 must not be lost.”  The Tunisian Revolution of 2010-2011 led Tunisia to become a democracy. In 2021, Saied issued an emergency declaration dismissing the government and suspending the parliament. He ruled by decree for about a year until a new constitution was approved in 2022 that concentrated power in the hands of the president. Saied’s government has become increasingly authoritarian since then.  Alice Gower, director of geopolitics and security at the Azure Strategy advisory firm, told The Media Line that Saied has consistently used arrests of high-ranking politicians to fend off potential threats. Ghannouchi’s sentencing “is yet another example of the repressive nature of the Saied government,” she said.  She noted that the international community’s relative silence on the issue has led to “what has been perceived as tacit indifference to what goes on in Tunis.”  Ghannouchi is popular among the Ennahda party faithful, but his reputation among the population at large is more mixed  Hamish Kinnear, a Middle East and North Africa analyst at the risk intelligence company Verisk Maplecroft, said that Ghannouchi’s prison sentence will spark outrage among supporters of the Ennahda party but is unlikely to inspire significant unrest in the country.  “Ghannouchi is popular among the Ennahda party faithful, but his reputation among the population at large is more mixed,” he told The Media Line.  Kinnear said that Ennahda was part of several post-revolution governments that failed to deliver economic prosperity. The party was also accused of involvement in the assassination of two popular secular politicians in 2013. Although party representatives have consistently denied the accusations, “many leftist Tunisians hold Ennahda responsible,” Kinnear said.  Saied has already isolated international donors and investors due to his erratic policies. The country’s economic woes are now so dire that it needs financial support from elsewhere, despite Saied’s claims to be working to avoid indebtedness.  Similarly, Gower said both Ghannouchi and his party “have faced waning popularity for failure to embrace the younger generation and address the country’s economic plight.”  She said that Ghannouchi’s sentencing will increase the sense of instability in Tunisia, aggravating the country’s economic distress.  “Saied has already isolated international donors and investors due to his erratic policies. The country’s economic woes are now so dire that it needs financial support from elsewhere, despite Saied’s claims to be working to avoid indebtedness,” Gower said.  Although Western governments have expressed alarm at the arrest of Ghannouchi and other opposition figures, Kinnear said that it is unlikely that governments would turn to sanctions or a halt to economic aid, since such measures “would risk undermining Tunisia’s political stability.”  He explained that the Biden Administration is currently lobbying for Tunisia to secure an International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan and sign up for a program of structural reforms that could resuscitate its struggling economy. The work currently being done to stabilize Tunisia makes it unlikely that the US would do anything that might push “the country closer to the economic abyss,” he said.  Gower said that the chaos currently going on in Tunisia is the result of the international community’s ongoing refusal to intervene. She called on the US, a major supplier of aid to Tunisia and central figure in the IMF, to “demand answers and change before authorizing further military aid and the rollout of an IMF loan program.”"

Such a law, signed a few months after the triumph of the Cuban Revolution, allowed large estates´ belongings to local landowners to be delivered to rural workers who have received other benefits denied until then, such as access to healthcare, education, and housing.  The Agrarian Reform and a series of measures taken by the new Cuban government marked the beginning of the country’s economic recovery, which plunged into rural precariousness due to the obsolete production systems.

These judicial orders have also, post-facto, reaffirmed the alleged correctness of the sole legal and judicial strategy of the government’s legal team: whenever you lose a case partly due to your own incompetence, tell everyone that the judge has been influenced.  But is the PDM-PPP government correct in its judicial fairytale analysis that these allegedly ‘defective’ judicial orders are the result of an alleged bias in favour of Imran Khan? Or is Imran Khan correct in constructing his alternative judicial fairytale analysis that these decisions are strictly a product of the application of the Constitution and the law, without any extraneous influences and predispositions?  The paradox: After over 100 registered cases, an assassination attempt, assaults on his home, the large-scale prosecution of PTI leaders and workers, a proxy case seeking his political disqualification on the non-disclosure of his alleged daughter, Tyrian White, and even a case questioning his nikah, can anyone seriously doubt that Imran Khan is the subject of systemic political vendetta and state repression?  If we are honest enough to admit these facts then what is so legally extraordinary about the relief of no-arrest and protective bail, for a very limited period only, granted by the SC and IHC to Imran Khan? The government cannot seriously challenge the legality of these six judicial orders for two main reasons.  Firstly, the SC order dated May 11, 2023, was passed by a three-member bench which also included Justice Athar Minallah. Is the government now alleging that even Justice Minallah is ‘biased’, someone whom the government only recently celebrated as a great dissenting SC judge? Secondly, no serious lawyer or legal scholar can question the legality of such limited and temporary no-arrest relief by the SC and IHC.  Therefore, the main focus of their critique has been on the extraordinary speed and generosity of this legally correct relief — this speed and generosity, they allege, tends to show bias in favour of Imran Khan. Therefore, the apparent paradox of how such judicial relief can be both legally and constitutionally correct but might exhibit alleged bias needs to be explained.  Most judges cannot escape the constraints imposed by the Constitution and the law.  Beyond fairytales: In periods of relative democratic rule in Pakistan, even in highly politicised cases, most judges cannot escape the constraints imposed by the Constitution and the law. But this is subject to the two caveats of contested interpretations and judicial discretion.  Both the Constitution and the law allow judges to adopt differing judicial interpretations of the Constitution and the law, and thus also allow judges enough judicial discretion to either deny or grant judicial relief to individuals in similar circumstances. This ‘undefined space’ created by differing interpretations and judicial discretion is filled with fear, desires and visions which judges experience and express in their judicial role.  As Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes observed: “The life of the law has not been logic: it has been experience. The felt necessities of the time, the prevalent moral and political theories, intuitions of public policy … even the prejudices which judges share with their fellow-men…”.  Judicial interpretations and discretion, although controlled by the Constitution and the law, are also influenced by the fear of losing judicial power or privileges, by judicial desires and visions coloured by their political and social views and class, gender and geographical backgrounds. Like all of us, judges are also human beings.  Fear, desires and visions: Two key judicial cases document both the acceptance and denial of the Pakistani judge’s apprehension of the coercive power of the state. Firstly, the contempt case against retired Gen Mirza Aslam Beg (1993), where it was alleged that he had sent a message to the SC not to restore the dissolved National Assembly of the Junejo government. Gen Beg recanted and the SC went into denial.  Secondly, the challenge to the Eighth Constitutional Amendment recorded in the Mahmood Achakzai case (1997). In this case, Justice Saleem Akhtar records the admission of Syed Sharifuddin Pirzada that he had, by implication, threatened CJP Anwar-ul-Haq with his removal as CJP if Gen Zia was not given the power to amend the Constitution.  After recording this damning admission, the SC slumbered in silence. These are actual cases of interference, but generally, there is apprehension among judges of the tremendous coercive power of the state, especially the deep state. No wonder, the cases of missing persons have witnessed judicial silence, with former CJP Iftikhar Chaudhry and former CJ Athar Minallah and the IHC being exceptions.  Moreover, judges, while interpreting the Constitution, which is replete with political ideology and values, appear to act like applied political theorists, as David Robertson explains in his book Judges as Political Theorists. Political and social views influence judicial desires and visions, which in turn structure legal interpretations. Isn’t the US supreme court publicly perceived as being composed of bitterly divided Republican and Democratic judges?  Also, judges are influenced by their class, gender and geographical backgrounds. Can anyone deny that the rich and middle classes have a better chance of getting much speedier relief than the poor? Further, one of the differences between the judicial interpretation of Article 63A of the Constitution, by Justice Munib Akhtar and Justice Mandokhail might stem from their geographical origins. A judge from Balochistan might show more sympathy in giving politicians the benefit of the doubt.  The key is not to wish for super human judges without predispositions but for greater judicial accountability and transparency to expose biases and a more representative judiciary which represents our (all too human) predispositions.

May 15, 2023  In 1956, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), J. Edgar Hoover, convinced US President Eisenhower of the ominous danger faced by Americans from homegrown dissidents, and justified the use of an undercover operation known as Counter Intelligence Program (COINTELPRO), “to suppress and destroy all radical subversives in the US”.  Historical records show that J. Edgar Hoover executed a series of covert, and often illegal, projects conducted by FBI agents, aimed at “investigating and disrupting dissident political organizations”. According to these records, “eighty-five percent of the resources of this program were expended on infiltrating, disrupting, marginalizing, and/or subverting groups suspected of being subversive; such as communist, socialist, militant black groups, women’s groups, civil rights groups and the American Indian Movement”. Hoover ordered his agents to “expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit or otherwise neutralize” these groups. So paranoid was Hoover about these supposed internal enemies that he even saw Dr. Martin Luther King, a pacifist, as an enemy of the state, and therefore ordered wire taps and constant surveillance to keep an eye on Dr. King.  COINTELPRO had specific methodologies to reach its objective, one of which was the tried and tested tactic of turning ‘brother against brother’. They played on internal ego conflicts, whispering in the ear of contending brothers and exaggerating small things into big things; then supplied the weapons to murder when the arguments got out of control  We also learned from the records how they infiltrated the Nation of Islam (NOI) and were involved in the assassination of Malcolm X, the armed attack on the American Indian Movement at Wounded Knee in South Dakota, and the infiltration of the Black Panther Party (BPP) which resulted in the death of Bobby Hutton, Fred Hampton and Mark Clark. (For further research, use Google).  While COINTELPRO officially ended in 1971, suspicions persist that the program’s tactics continued informally and may have also been used in the Caribbean. Unlike the US, where the use of the Freedom of Information Act has provided their citizens access to documents which revealed information about US covert activity, in the Caribbean, unfortunately, no such access exists, despite Freedom of Information provisions in our laws.  We know that between 1968 and 1975 there was a revolutionary fervor running throughout the Caribbean. These groups were nationalistic, black, socialist, and a mixture of the educated and the grass-roots working together for a common purpose. To name a few, there were the Joint National Action Committee (NJAC) in Trinidad, New Jewel Movement (NJM)in Granada, Working Peoples Alliance (WPA) in Guyana, and the United Black Association for Development (UBAD) in Belize, with others in Jamaica, Antigua, and Barbados. These groups were not only of security interest to their respective governments, but also drew the attention of British and American intelligence.  According to the record, they used sleepers who posed as dedicated followers but were secretly agents of the US/UK intelligence network. These sleepers were sophisticated and very subtle in their execution of their scheme. They are the “whisperer” described in the Qur’an, who withdraws after his whisper, thereby making you think it was your idea. These agents from this intelligence network are very subtle, sometimes appearing as good advisors.  We know again from antidotal observation rather than recorded facts, that agents must have been involved in exaggerating the differences between Maurice Bishop and Bernard Corde which ultimately resulted in a faction, led by Corde, assassinating his friend and comrade, Prime Minister Maurice Bishop, on October 19, 1983. This was the power of the tactic of COINTELPRO to stop or suppress revolutionary movements as they rose in the west. Understanding that this strategy continues to be used to destroy black movements, we can better understand how the rift between Bishop and Corde occurred, which led to Bishop’s assassination, and ultimately created the enabling environment for the invasion of the US forces, which brought the New Jewel Movement government to an abrupt end.  In the case of Belize, it will take some ambitious young Belizean American, using the Freedom of Information Act in the US, to access some of the documents of embassy officials and CIA agents to see how Belize was being viewed by COINTELPRO in the late sixties, early seventies.  It’s not clear how the operation was unfolded in Belize, but the results tell us that there must have been some scheme afoot to exacerbate ego conflicts and splinter unity of action. How else could you explain how intelligent men like Norman Fairweather, Bert Franklin, Evan X Hyde, Roy Cayetano, Bert Tucker, Dr. Joe Palacio, Nuri Muhammad and so many others could go through the seventies and eighties, nineties, and now 23 years into the new century, and not have formed some kind of front to advance the cause which they all for so long have espoused?  How else could you explain this monumental failure of these intellectual activists to not forge something larger than themselves? These so-called cultural/nationalistic/religious leaders did not deliver a collective response to the problem. The horrible condition of young black males (Creole/Garifuna) in 2010, is our collective burden.  Clearly, we can’t blame the implosion of all these groups in the Caribbean to the machinations of British/American intelligence activities, because the endemic ego conflicts played an equally important role in our eventual demise. But one cannot discount the role of agents within these organizations in turning brother against brother. It worked in the Congo, Kenya, and Algeria and in the US with the NOI and the BPP.  Some say that, clearly, Black Power as defined by the radicals of the 60s and 70s has been defeated in the eyes of the US Justice Department and has been relegated to the dust bins of undercover programs, some dating back to the 1920’s. They say Black Power is no longer a national security concern, and there is no need to focus on the specter of “Black Power” anymore; “Black Power” is no longer a foundation or platform for social action in America. In fact, in Belize, “Black Power” is just a T-shirt fashion statement.  The new focus today is on narco-trafficking, money laundering, gun-running and human trafficking, but the biggest of them is the specter of radical Islam; therefore, Belize is filled with intelligence operatives who are not necessarily in the employ of the US Justice Department, yet they remain an essential source of information to the NSC.  There are the conscious agents and there are the un-conscious agents; we know what a conscious agent is about, but it’s the un-conscious agents that slip between the radar because they themselves don’t realize that they are inadvertently, agents of the intelligence network.  I remember interviewing former CIA agent Phillip Agee, in 1990, on KPFK Radio in Los Angeles. He was at one time stationed in Guatemala City and had some knowledge of the agency’s activities in Belize. He said that the CIA used a number of ways to assess a “point of interest” before executing any action. One way of assessing the climate of a target group is their public statements. Studying newspaper articles, editorials, op-eds, and monitoring radio talk shows is the major way the CIA assesses the climate in places like Belize. He said the CIA (and its British counterpart) may have tons of information gathered through its massive surveillance apparatus, but will only engage that information when the US or UK national security interest is threatened.

In a whistleblower complaint to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleging violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, obtained by the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and shared with partners in Malta, The Shift and The Times of Malta, Tumuluri claims the threats were made by former Office of the Prime Minister Chief of Staff Keith Schembri, then-health minister Konrad Mizzi and one of the concession’s original brokers, Shaukat Ali, among others.  Tumuluri also says that former prime minister Joseph Muscat played a role in what Tumuluri claims was a forced handover of the concession to Steward for €1. Muscat denies being a part of such coercive tactics, which is contradicted by Tumuluri’s filing and affidavit. Schembri has also vociferously denied Tumuluri’s claims.  Tumuluri has also accused Steward Health Care of engaging in unlawful activity with the government of Malta and insists he only signed the concession over because he was made to fear for his life by government officials and others working on their behalf.  The 505-page complaint includes an affidavit from Tumuluri and hundreds of pages of supporting documents, such as internal emails, contracts and project plans.  He said they lasted through the period of her assassination that October until Tumuluri says he eventually caved into demands in December 2017 and signed the concession over because he feared his life and that of his family would be in danger if he didn’t.  Schembri, according to Tumuluri’s disclosure, warned him that “[he] is the law in Malta” and that no agreement could protect Tumuluri’s interest.  He allegedly warned that “if the government could silence a vocal reporter like Ms Caruana Galizia, Mr Tumuluri should be very careful not to make enemies with the government”.  ‘You want us to be a friend, not a foe’  Tumuluri alleges in his SEC whistleblower disclosure that at one meeting at Castille, Schembri told him, “You know what happened with Daphne [Caruana Galizia] and you don’t want to end up in that position. You want us to be a friend, not a foe.”  Tumuluri discloses several meetings in which he alleges his life had been threatened and claims he was pulled aside afterwards from one such meeting, by Mizzi, who warned him, “Don’t force these guys to go to that level.”  At another such meeting, Tumuluri says Shaukat Ali and his son Ali, who he says were “acting as de facto agents and representatives of the government of Malta”, told Tumuluri that although he had signed up to do business with a European Member State, Malta was, in fact, a “mafia state” where “the cost of life is less than €10,000.”  Chillingly, during these meetings in the presence of both Schembri and Mizzi, Shaukat Ali told Tumuluri, according to his account, that if the government could “get rid of someone like Daphne” Tumuluri was of no significance and that it could also “get rid of” him quite easily.  Tumuluri claims that it was only under duress and “as a result of the repeated threats of violence and other harm, including the threats of murder conveyed to him in December 2017” that he ultimately gave in to the government’s demands that he sell Bluestone’s shares in Vitals Malta to Steward.  ‘We need to silence Daphne’ – Schembri  In his official SEC filing, seen by The Shift and investigative partners, Tumuluri says he feared that if he did not comply with the government’s demands, he would be murdered by “agents of the government of Malta”.  He claims that over the course of the preceding year he “had various frightening and otherwise uncomfortable experiences with the government of Malta”.  He details how on one such occasion in early 2017, he was present at the Office of the Prime Minister with Mizzi and Schembri.  Tumuluri says that Schembri turned to him and stated, “in sum and substance that ‘we need to silence Daphne [Caruana Galizia]’, and asked whether “we know anyone who could get rid of her.”  Tumuluri says he thought Schembri had been joking at the time and disregarded the comment.  He says he began changing his mind after he said he witnessed the detonation of a car bomb on the other side of the road while he was driving in Malta in February 2017.  Tumuluri was presumably referring to the car bomb in Msida that left Romeo Bone severely injured on 20 February 2017.  Tumuluri says he later heard Schembri “chastise the individual or individuals responsible for the car bomb that Mr Tumuluri had witnessed on the grounds that the operation had not been conducted properly”.  Cardona ‘cancelled Sicilian hit on Caruana Galizia’  Soon after that, in March or April 2017, Tumuluri claims he attended a meeting at the Office of the Prime Minister with Schembri, Mizzi, and Asad Ali, the latter being the son of one of the hospitals’ original dealmakers Shaukat Ali.  Tumuluri reports in his FCPA filing that Schembri told him at that meeting that former minister Chris Cardona, one of Caruana Galizia’s frequent targets, “had paid the Sicilian mafia €10,000 to assassinate Ms Caruana Galizia” but that Cardona the next day developed a case of “cold feet and had cancelled the directive”.  Schembri, Tumuluri says in his sworn statement, said that Cardona had never gotten the money back after cancelling the directive.”  Tumuluri claims he had the impression that Schembri made the statements “as an amusing anecdote and to mock Cardona for being weak,” but despite this, he still “felt deeply uncomfortable, concerned, and intimidated”.  An investor’s hand  In another disturbing incident Tumuluri reported to the SEC, he says was present for a meeting at the OPM in December 2017 where several individuals, including Schembri and Armin Ernst, had discussed a court injunction filed by Ashok Rattehalli, then a consultant and medical director for Vitals.  Rattehalli had been employed with Vitals since June 2016 and had received an option to purchase 5% of Vitals Malta shares as part of his compensation.  But since Tumuluri could not permit Rattehalli to exercise the option because a deal to hand the concession over to Steward had not yet been brokered, Rattehalli had sought and obtained an injunction to prevent the transfer of Vitals to Steward, as The Shift had revealed.  According to Tumuluri’s filing, “During this meeting, Schembri received a telephone call from Asad Ali reporting that Asad Ali had threatened Rattehalli by advising him that he would cut off Rattehalli’s hand and use his hand to apply a signature to a document to withdraw the injunction if he did not withdraw the injunction himself.”  Rattehalli, Tumuluri said, “immediately withdrew the injunction as directed”.  Muscat’s involvement  Although Muscat insists he played no role in the deal, Tumuluri insists that “Schembri’s demands that Mr Tumuluri sign the share-purchase agreement [with Steward] were made at the direction of Muscat”.  During the meeting, Tumuluri claims that “Muscat entered the room and demanded that the share-purchase agreement be signed that same day”.  Tumuluri claims that Muscat told him, “Do I need to butt your heads together to get this signed?”  Before leaving the room, Tumuluri says, Muscat advised Schembri that he expected the share-purchase agreement to be signed within half an hour.  Schembri then, according to Tumuluri’s account, asked him to step outside the room with him because he did not want to say certain things in the presence of lawyers.  “Schembri began discussing political relationships among ministers and advised that the government had to oust Mr Tumuluri from the concession and had to replace him with Ernst and Steward.”  Tumuluri says Schembri further advised that Muscat had asked Schembri to speak to him personally “to ensure that the share purchase agreement was signed the same day”.  Tumuluri further claims that Muscat had instructed Schembri to remove Tumuluri and Bluestone and to transfer the concession to a then-undisclosed third party, which later turned out to be Steward, with which the government had already struck a deal.  That meeting was in December 2017, and Schembri, Tumuluri says, told him the government wanted to announce the concession’s transfer to Steward by Christmas.  He says at that point, Schembri warned that if he “wanted to do business in Europe or elsewhere again, he should stay on his ‘nice’ side, as opposed to his ‘nasty’ side, he should remain a ‘friend’” and not a ‘foe’, and he should sign the share-purchase agreement immediately.”  Brown bags and a board position  Nor was Steward chairman and CEO Ralph de la Torre, who has not replied to the investigation’s questions, spared in Tumuluri’s US SEC filing, with Tumuluri claiming de la Torre told him that he had no problem with bribing government officials if need be.  “In touting Steward’s supposed competitive advantage in Malta, de la Torre told Mr Tumuluri that Steward was not as rigid as Partners Healthcare International [Tumuluri’s former partner for the deal],” according to the filing.  Along such lines, Tumuluri adds that “de la Torre boasted that he could issue ‘brown bags’ to government officials if necessary to close transactions, insinuating that he would bribe officials of the government of Malta.”  Tumuluri says he did not respond to the “brown bag” comment and did not agree to assist Steward with any violations in Malta of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. He said he did, however, agree to further discussions with de la Torre, subject to a non-disclosure agreement, to explore the possibility of Steward serving as an equity investor in Vitals Global.  Tumuluri claims that through the latter part of 2016 and the entirety of 2017, Ernst conspired with Steward CEO Ralph de la Torre, along with government officials and others, to steal his confidential and proprietary information, such as business models, intellectual property, and other trade secrets; defame him; undermine his business relationships; disrupt financing to Vitals Malta; and to strip him of his interests in Vitals Malta and the hospital-services concession.  He also claims the collusion was aimed at blocking him and Vitals from extending his Malta business model to other countries in Europe and thwarting the implementation of his business model through an information-technology platform in the United States and abroad.  Tumuluri says he also had information from Shaukat Ali that, during the discussions between the government and Steward around September and December 2017, de la Torre also had travelled to Malta and had met with Prime Minister Muscat on multiple occasions.  He also says that, according to Schembri, Ernst had been in discussions with the new Health Minister, Chris Fearne, about taking the concession from Vitals Malta.  He claims Shaukat Ali told him that de la Torre offered Muscat a seat on the Steward Board once he left his government position. Tumuluri provided no follow-up to the discussion he says Ali had cited.  ‘Completely false and baseless’  When it comes to the threats Tumuluri says he was made, Keith Schembri perhaps features most prominently. When asked to react to the accusations being made in his respect, Schembri labelled the accusations as “completely false and baseless”.  Schembri, in a stark contradiction to Tumuluri’s claims, insists it was Steward Healthcare that approached “us” at the United Nations General Assembly in New York to express their interest in acquiring Vitals in Malta.  “It is unfortunate that Mr Tumuluri has chosen to make such outrageous claims, and I question his motives behind doing so.  “It appears that he has a vivid imagination and is attempting to associate this case with the tragic murder of Mrs Caruana Galizia, which is absolutely horrendous.”  “I vehemently protest against these baseless allegations and false claims made by Mr Tumuluri.”  On his part, Muscat says it is a “clear and uncontested” fact that he was “made aware of Steward’s interest in the concession after Steward and VGH reached an agreement in principle on the concession”.  He adds, in a complete contradiction of Tumuluri’s filing, “I categorically deny being at any stage involved in the negotiations between the two sides, either directly or indirectly, and I never asked for any position.”  “I also emphatically deny ever organising and/or attending any meeting whatsoever involving Steward and VGH. I challenge anyone to produce any sort of evidence to the contrary.”  “As stated numerous times, my only interest was in a seamless transition between the two entities as an agreement was reached.”  Like Schembri and Muscat, Shaukat Ali also denied the accusations Tumuluri is levelling, saying, “I can confirm that the allegations of wrongdoing, as stated in your communications, against me and my son are entirely false and vehemently denied.”  He also warned he was “liaising with our lawyers both in Malta and abroad who are monitoring the situation, including the publication of defamatory material. Should the need arise, we will not hesitate to take legal action.”  As for Konrad Mizzi, the former health minister insisted Tumuluri had not been coerced into handing over the hospitals’ concession.  “I reject any claim that Mr Tumuluri was being bullied into exiting, and deny even being aware that he received any threat if he did. If a statement was made stating that I was present, then it is false.”  “At the time of the transfer of shares, government had approved the transfer onto Steward after the Office of the Prime Minister was approached with a proposal for the acquisition of the concession. My understanding is that as private parties, the transferor and transferee were free to accept or decline to reach an agreement, and an agreement was in fact reached.”  When contacted about the filing, Steward Health Care International said it “emphatically rejects any and all allegations of impropriety made by Tumuluri, who is widely reported and recognised as an international fraudster, against the company and its directors.”  “We consider these accusations malicious, self-serving and entirely without merit. We reserve our rights to take legal action to defend our position and reputation.”  Click on the following links for the full replies supplied by Keith Schembri, Shaukat Ali, Konrad Mizzi and Joseph Muscat.

The hyper-realistic cowboy-and-tuberculosis simulator made a splash on arrival, and with many calling it one of the greatest titles the medium has produced, it left a lasting legacy  Sadly, that legacy is petering out, with a declining playerbase and a severe lack of sustenance for Red Dead Online players. The slow decline in content is a point of serious upset for many fans, and the dedicated still wish that things were different. So, how about a refresh with 22 new missions for Red Dead Redemption 2?  Modders add 22 new missions to RDR 2  Click to enlarge NexusMods - Shtivi  Modder Shtivi has brought to life hopes that Rockstar would help bolster its cowboy caper. They've added a huge wealth of missions to Red Dead Redemption 2.  The mod is titled RDR Contracts and introduces a new means of playing the game, with new auto-generated bounty hunter-style missions that see players hunting down assassination targets. Similar to how GTA Online regularly adds new content, this is effectively RDR2's answer to it.  ""Over 22 different mission scenarios with hundreds of possible variations, difficulty levels, challenges and locations!"" reads the game's page on Nexus Mods.  Not only is this going to fill the time of die-hards, but it's a brand-new means of earning some extra loot too. It's a real treat to see that there's much more to do in a game that many feel has been left to die as Rockstar turns it attention to GTA 6.  How can I play the new RDR 2 missions?  Click to enlarge NexusMods - Shtivi  If you want to get a hold of the new bounties in Red Dead Redemption 2, all you have to do is give the mod a download on its Nexus Mods page.  This sadly means that the new missions are exclusive to PC, but here's hoping that better mod support could come to console in the future in place of content from Rockstar. Yeah, good luck with that one."

This classic cut-and-paste method of ransom note construction presumably emerged as means of evading minds like that of Trista Ginsberg, a document analyst specializing in handwriting at the Secret Service. She appears in the Great Big Story above, which comes to focus on one facility at the Service’s headquarters in particular: the International Ink Library.  “The Secret Service has the largest ink library in the world,” says the video’s narrator. Its more than 12,000 samples of different inks include “pens, bottled ink, and printer cartridges.” These come in handy when, say, “someone writes a threatening letter to the president.”  A document analyst like Irina Geiman samples the letter’s ink, and then, by comparing it to the inks in the library, “she can figure out what kind of ink was used, and, hopefully, it can help solve the case.” Geiman also explains a less dramatic type of case that comes across her desk rather more often: at-home inkjet counterfeiting of $20 bills.  Though that may not be the highest example of the counterfeiter’s art, the art itself motivated the creation of the Secret Service in 1865 as a branch of the U.S. Treasury Department. “Following the Civil War,” says the Secret Service’s FAQ, “it was estimated that one-third to one-half of the currency in circulation was counterfeit.” It was in 1901, after the McKinley assassination, that “the Secret Service was first tasked with its second mission: the protection of the president.” Hence the cultural currency of the image of the would-be president assassin evading governmental pursuit while laboriously assembling his missives one letter at a time — surely reason enough for the Secret Service to have put together a top-secret International Glue Library.  via Messy Nessy  Related content:  How Ink is Made: The Process Revealed in a Mouth-Watering Video  Books Made with Disappearing Ink Strategically Fade Away  Anatomy of a Fake: Forgery Experts Reveal 5 Ways To Spot a Fake Painting by Jackson Pollock (or Any Other Artist)  Read the CIA’s Simple Sabotage Field Manual: A Timeless Guide to Subverting Any Organization with “Purposeful Stupidity” (1944)  Based in Seoul, Colin Marshall writes and broadcasts on cities, language, and culture.

The hitman and another man were sentenced to life imprisonment.  Today, Trang Provincial Court sentenced 52 year old Charinrat “Chuan” Kruthirat to death after he and two others were found guilty of murdering 54 year old Somsak “Lawyer Wao” Ochuenjit in 2021. Chuan was the mastermind behind the lawyer’s assassination.  At 7.40am on May 4, 2021, a gunman fatally shot Somsak while he was working in a rubber plantation near his home. Somsak had not long before told his family that he was receiving death threats.  Somsak was assassinated after leading a campaign for the right to agricultural land for poor farmers in Wang Wiset district. Tensions were high between local farmers occupying oil plantations without valid leases, government agencies, and private companies backed by politicians.  Four days later, the Asia director at Human Rights Watch, Brad Adams, called on the Thai authorities to investigate the murder…  “Thai authorities should not just stand by while grassroots activists in southern provinces are being murdered for standing up for their communities.”  “The Thai government should urgently conduct a credible and impartial investigation and bring those responsible for Somsak’s death to justice.”  Human Rights Watch pointed out that five land activists have been killed in southern Thailand over the past decade.  Two years on, justice is set to be served for Somsak after the court sentenced Chuan to death for planning the murder and hiring a hitman.  The court also sentenced the former village chief of Moo 10, Chalermwat “Yai Pua” Nokroorak, to life imprisonment for his role in the planning of the murder although he did not participate on the day itself.  The hitman, Saranyoo “Nil” Kueboonsong, was at first sentenced to death for shooting dead Somsak. However, because the hitman ratted out Chuan – helping the police’s investigation hugely – and plead guilty, his sentence was reduced to life imprisonment.  All three men were taken into custody after the verdict was read yesterday and taken to Trang Provincial Prison.  Follow us on :              Somsak’s family travelled to Khao Phra Wiset Temple after the verdict was read to burn incense and to inform Somsak’s spirit to rest easy because justice had finally been served.

Set to take effect July 1, 2023, the move by a Republican-dominated legislature has been criticized by opponents as creating a ""separate and unequal"" court system that is not answerable to the majority-Black community it would seek to govern.  The law was justified by supporters as an effort to curb the city's crime level, which includes one of the highest murder rates in the nation. But the move is the second time in as many months that state legislatures have taken highly visible actions to effectively disenfranchise Black voters: On April 6, the Tennessee House of Representatives expelled two Black members who represented mostly Black districts.  As a sociologist who studies race and ethnicity, I have closely followed these moves by the states. Throughout U.S. history, I see three main periods of legislative disenfranchisement in which legislative bodies have voted to expel members. These events have been shown to be a form of ""white backlash"" working to keep Black officeholders out of power and their constituents powerless without representation.  Reconstruction and legislative disenfranchisement  After the Civil War, the United States engaged in a brief period known as Reconstruction, which lasted from 1865 to 1877. It was a deliberate attempt to reverse the negative effects and legacies of slavery by enacting economic, political and social policies that directly benefited the formerly enslaved Black people of the South.  The efforts included formally abolishing slavery nationwide, guaranteeing equal protection of the laws to everyone regardless of race, and allowing formerly enslaved people to vote. In addition, formerly Confederate land was set aside for newly freed Black families, and former Confederate soldiers were not allowed to vote.  But after Tennessee politician Andrew Johnson, who had been Abraham Lincoln's running mate in 1864, took office upon Lincoln's assassination, many of those provisions of Reconstruction were reversed. Former Confederate combatants were allowed to vote, and confiscated Confederate property was returned to its prewar owners.  In addition, Johnson and Congress made it easier for defeated Confederate states to rejoin the Union, which allowed former Confederate leaders to regain their previous positions of power in local and national governments.  Georgia was originally readmitted to the Union in July 1868. But just two months later, in September, the Democratically controlled Georgia Assembly, with a total of 196 members, voted to expel all 33 of its Black elected officials.  Immediately upon making themselves into an all-white legislature, the remaining assembly members enacted the infamous Black Codes. These codes created a unique set of laws specific to the newly freed Blacks, including limiting the types of work they could do.  Collectively, the legislative expulsion of the Black officials and the imposition of the Black Codes served to effectively disenfranchise the Black voters of Georgia. Senator Henry McNeal Turner, one of those expelled, defiantly asked: ""Am I a man? If I am such, I claim the rights of a man.""  Interim Archives/Getty Images  The civil rights era  Another major effort to disenfranchise Black Americans came during their next major push to achieve political, social and economic equality: the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s. Opponents targeted two prominent civil rights activists who had been elected to represent their communities: Adam Clayton Powell Jr. and Julian Bond.  Bond was elected as a Democrat to the Georgia House of Representatives in 1965, but on Jan. 10, 1966, the Democratically controlled House voted not to seat him, citing his criticism of U.S. involvement in Vietnam and support of students who were protesting the war. A year later, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Bond's First Amendment rights had been violated and ordered that he be seated. But for that intervening year, his constituents had no voice in their state legislature. Bond ultimately served in the Georgia legislature for another two decades, before turning to teaching and activism.  Powell's situation was different. He was the first African American to be elected to Congress from New York and from any state in the Northeast. Starting in 1945, he represented the district that included the majority-Black Harlem neighborhood of New York City. He became one of the most important Democrats in the House, but in the mid-1960s, he found himself embroiled in personal and financial scandals.  After the election of 1966, the House created a committee to investigate Powell's actions and refused to seat him until the committee's report was complete. The report found fault, but committee members were split on the proper discipline for Powell. Ultimately the whole House voted to keep him out.  Powell sued to reclaim his seat, saying the House had excluded him unconstitutionally. He also won the special election in April 1967 created by the vacancy but didn't take his seat because of the lawsuit. The removal of Powell meant that Harlem was the only congressional district in the nation without a representative from 1967 to 1969.  In 1969, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the House had acted unconstitutionally by refusing to seat Powell. By then, Powell had also won the 1968 regularly scheduled election and had been seated, though without the seniority and committee positions that would normally have been given to someone who had continuously been a House member.  Black Lives Matter movement  In the aftermath of the George Floyd killing, a new social movement emerged across the United States. With this new activism came another ""white backlash"" in the form of legislative disenfranchisement.  In May 2022, Tiara Young Hudson, a long-serving Black public defender, won the Democratic primary for a judgeship in Jefferson County, Alabama. More than half of the county's population is nonwhite. Facing no opposition in the general election, she was expected to win and take office.  But two weeks after the primary, a state judicial commission, divided along racial lines, eliminated the position she was a candidate for and created a new judgeship in the majority-white Madison County.  Hudson immediately sued to block the shift, saying it violated the Alabama Constitution and only the state legislature had the authority to reallocate judgeships. In March 2023, the state supreme court dismissed Hudson's complaint, effectively stripping the Black people of Jefferson County of a representative they had elected to be their voice on the state's roster of judges.  And on April 6, 2023, the Republican majority of the Tennessee House of Representatives voted to expel two Black legislators – Justin Pearson and Justin Jones – for participating in a protest calling for gun legislation following yet another mass shooting.  Within days, both Pearson and Jones had been temporarily reinstated by processes for filling vacant seats, but still face special elections to fully reclaim their seats. Their alleged violation was participating in a protest against the legislature's rules – but their real violation, I believe, was that they were Black, outspoken and pushed for change.

Trevor Jackson (Grown-ish, Superfly) will co-star. Myriad Pictures is shopping the project to buyers here in Cannes this week.  Mace is the harrowing story of two very different types of cops – a veteran officer Mace (LaBeouf), dangerous and corrupt, and Virgil Woods (Jackson), a young rookie who believes that he can change the system that fosters cops like Mace from within. It’s inspired by the recent racial injustice on the streets of America and Woods refuses to be bullied and pits his principles against the amoral Mac. Woods risks everything he believes to stop Mace from destroying the city when Mace unleashes a gang war to cover up his crimes. Everyone around Mace is in danger as Mace plays his game and tries to conceal his tracks, no matter the cost.  The Meyers Media Group production is projected to start later this year in New Jersey with additional casting underway. Lawrence Steven Meyers, John Evangelides, Randy Dannenberg and Robert Maclean will produce. Brendan McDonald and Kirk D’Amico will serve as exec producers. Tribune Pictures is onboard to co-produce and co-finance the film.  LaBeouf can next be seen in Francis Ford Coppola’s highly anticipated Megalopolis and he’s just joined the cast of David Mamet’s Assassination. He most recently wrapped production on Abel Ferarra’s Padre Pio which follows the life of the now saint during his time as a monk in Puglia, Italy.  Amiel is an award-winning director, writer and producer who garnered international acclaim for The Singing Detective and followed that with Queen of Hearts, which premiered in Cannes. His further credits include Tune in Tomorrow, with Keanu Reeves and Peter Falk, Copycat with Sigourney Weaver and Holly Hunter and Entrapment with Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones.

We think that with Jon Amiel at the helm and Shia in the title role that the result will be extraordinary and exciting.”  Meyers added, “We are really excited to have assembled such a package. With the amazing screenplay, Jon at the helm, and Shia joining Trevor as the lead actors, it is an irresistible creative coup for us.

By Valerie Ettenhofer · Published on May 17th, 2023  Welcome to Up Next, a recurring column keeping an eye out for the best new shows on the horizon. This week, TV critic Valerie Ettenhofer checks in with a review of FX’s new drama Class of ’09.  Imagine if AI technology could solve crimes. Free from the bias and limited resources of police, unburdened by human anger or fear, a computer that’s a dozen steps ahead of its users might just be the key to a safer world. Except, if you’ve watched or read any number of sci-fi stories in this vein, from Minority Report to the works of Isaac Asimov, you’ll know that this concept is little more than a shiny pipe dream. The new FX/Hulu series Class of ’09 attempts to mine this familiar plot once more, but its sleek style and intriguing cast aren’t enough to make it feel fresh. Instead, the series loses itself in a hazy sort of mystique that, in the four episodes available for review, fails to coalesce in a meaningful way.  Tom Rob Smith’s (Assassination of Gianni Versace) Class of ’09 tells the story of a particularly important class of FBI recruits, jumping back and forth between their time at Quantico, the height of their careers, and a timeline several decades later when the former colleagues end up back in one another’s lives by strange and mysterious circumstances. Nothing is that strange and mysterious, though, and that might be Class of ’09’s biggest problem; the show keeps the languid, contemplative pace of something like Alex Garland’s Devs but seems to have much less on its mind or up its sleeve. The entire show feels surprisingly muted, even in its most action-packed moments. An odd sense of emotional distance keeps even the show’s most surprising beats from fully working.  The series stars Kate Mara (A Teacher, House of Cards), and while the actress is as watchable as ever, there’s a blankness to her character, Poet. Her classmates are equally dull but at least have more interesting backstories. Tayo (Brian Tyree Henry, Atlanta) is underestimated by his teachers and classmates in the FBI program and wants to prove them wrong. He has grand ambitions that tie directly to his own experiences as a Black man. Hour (Sepideh Moafi, Black Bird), Poet’s Quantico roommate, has her own motivations for changing the world, and they stem from the experiences of her immigrant parents.  All of these actors have been fantastic in tons of other projects, yet here, they often take an almost toneless approach to their lines that saps the life out of most scenes. The robots of Class of ‘09 are all of the algorithmic variety. Still, for a few brief moments in early episodes, I wondered if this inexplicably boring bunch was secretly a bunch of androids. Alas, it seems as if the series is purposely going for a cool, detached demeanor, and its narrative simply doesn’t have the juice to pull it off.  Class of ’09 does fit nicely into the sleek sci-fi TV show format in other ways, though. Will Bates’ score is excellent, and the show’s direction is as striking and artistic as one would expect from an FX-related production. The cast is so talented that they’re still sometimes enjoyable to watch, even when the story and scripts don’t capitalize on their full range of abilities. A plot involving a shady, cultish figure played by Mark Pellegrino (Supernatural, Lost) temporarily gets the show’s blood pumping, and each of his scenes is genuinely tense. Yet his scenes are relatively few and far between; instead, the series is focused mainly on presenting us with a series of solemn conversations among coworkers, many of which seem frustratingly vague thanks to the non-chronological timelines.  The series also goes deep on one aspect of its ideology while refusing to illustrate another. Its central technology is pitched as a world-saving crime radar of sorts, but its invention doesn’t quell questions about bias and hatred in the criminal justice system. The show seems poised to explore those moral questions related to racial profiling in-depth, but it still approaches its central topic from a stubbornly retributive justice-based standpoint. This is a “catch the bad guys” show, and its dream of a perfect world doesn’t seem to involve criminal rehabilitation or address the social and economic factors that lead to incarceration: it’s just a skilled bad guy-catching machine. There’s something disheartening about a utopian vision of the future of the criminal justice system that still doesn’t seem to see criminals as humans, and that’s a problem the show only partly addresses.  Class of ’09 is a surprisingly hard show to describe because tonally and emotionally, it leaves audiences grasping for purchase in what might just be a blank wall. The series isn’t offensively bad, and in some ways it’s artful. Still, its strange insistence on favoring the enigmatic over the engrossing or endearing (I came away not caring about a single character) overwhelms whatever it’s trying to pull off. Skip this one and instead watch any number of other projects featuring Henry, Mara, or Moafi – or just throw on Minority Report again.  Class of ’09 is currently airing on FX.

Pink Floyd - Pink Anderson and Floyd Council Photos of Pink Anderson and Floyd Council at the Pink Floyd exhibition Their Mortal Remains at London's Victoria and Albert Museum in 2017.  Lynyrd Skynyrd Southern rockers Lynyrd Skynyrd are named after high school gym teacher Leonard Skinner who taught Ronnie Van Zant, Gary Rossington, and Bob Burns at Robert E. Lee High School in Florida in the 1960s. Skinner was reportedly notorious for enforcing the school's policy against boys having long hair, and the Lynyrd Skynyrd band name was seen as an act of rebellion against him.  Lynyrd Skynyrd - Leonard Skinner A high school yearbook photos of Leonard Skinner in 1969. He died in 2010 aged 77.  The Yardbirds The influential British band's name was partially inspired by the nickname of American jazz saxophonist Charlie 'Yardbird' Parker. It's also the name given to rail yard hobos in Jack Kerouac's 1957 novel On the Road.  The Yardbirds - Charlie 'Yardbird' Parker Jazz musician Charlie 'Yardbird' Parker in 1955 – the year of his death aged just 34.  Ramones New York punk trailblazers Ramones were named by Dee Dee Ramone (Douglas Glenn Colvin) after Paul McCartney's briefly adopted pseudonym Paul Ramon in his Silver Beetles days in 1960.  Ramones - Paul Ramon with The Silver Beetles Paul McCartney (aka Paul Ramon) performs with The Silver Beetles in 1960. John Lennon and George Harrison were also in the group.  The Hollies The Hollies' co-founder Graham Nash revealed in a 2009 interview that they coined their band just moments before they were due to step on stage at the Oasis Club in Manchester in December 1962. The name comes from their admiration for Buddy Holly.  The Hollies - Buddy Holly Rock legend Buddy Holly in the late 1950s who inspired The Hollies band name. He died aged just 22 in the 3rd February 1959 plane crash that also claimed the lives of Ritchie Valens, ""The Big Bopper"" J. P. Richardson and their pilot Roger Peterson. It was later known as 'The Day the Music Died.'  Tesla Previously called City Kidd, the Sacramento rockers renamed themselves Tesla in homage to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla during the recording of their debut album 'Mechanical Resonance' in 1986. Some of the band's song and album titles nod towards Nikola Tesla too.  Tesla - Nikola Tesla An 1890 photo of 34-year-old inventor Nikola Tesla. He lived until he was 84 and was famously portrayed by David Bowie in the 2006 movie The Prestige.  Jethro Tull With Ian Anderson struggling to settle on a name for his band in the late 1960s (names included Navy Blue, Ian Henderson's Bag o' Nails, and Candy Coloured Rain), a member of the band's booking agent's staff christened them Jethro Tull after the 18th-century agriculturist.  Jethro Tull Jethro Tull, who helped to bring about the British Agricultural Revolution of the 18th century.

The pitfalls of self-expression through political assassination are on display in writer/director Musa Alderson-Clarke’s provocative and gritty short Killing Boris Johnson. Chas (Shadrach Agozino) is falling apart over the suicide of his mother. Suffering from seasonal depression, she counted on family gatherings during the holiday to get through. However, when Prime Minister Boris Johnson declared a lockdown in December 2020 and banned all get-togethers, Chas’ mom took her own life. He’s enraged because while his mother died and he was in isolation, Johnson secretly held his own private Christmas party, violating his own rules.  So now Chas has decided to kill Boris Johnson. There is an event at a children’s school the prime minister is scheduled to appear at, and he plans to go there and shoot him. Unfortunately, Chas soon discovers that there are no gun shops in England, so he is at the mercy of whatever homemade goods are available on the black market. His sister, Maia (Jesse Akele), tries to reach out to him, but Chas won’t let her into his flat. That may be because she would see his rubber Boris Johnson mask, the one that Chas puts on at night and looks in the mirror while punching himself in the head.  The frustration of the decisions made for you gets an escapist valve through dreams of dead monarchs and legislators. Killing Boris Johnson engages in this impulse but also shows how futile it is to dare follow it. Alderson-Clarke’s script walks the same path Taxi Driver does, except the concept here walks a little further. The filmmaker first sets up the emotional reason that Johnson is targeted for slaughter. Then, by bringing it from the political to the personal, the short connects the viewer to Chas’s emotional state instead of keeping him behind glass in an insane aquarium.  “…Chas has decided to kill Boris Johnson.”  This also allows Alderson-Clarke to explore the emotional agony of loss from suicide through excellent expressionistic set pieces that comment on vengeance. One particularly vivid example is Chas attacking himself wearing his Boris Johnson mask. His fury is directed outwards but is only causing him harm. This is crystalized in the squirm-inducing climax, which is thankfully left ambiguous.  Agozino gives an outstanding performance, pulling off the challenging trick of giving us relatable alienation. He slowly boils the watcher in his craziness instead of letting loose with a full-throttle nutter. Akele provides a well-grounded counter-balance to ensure everyone isn’t heading down Derangement Lane.  The production quality is excellent and very polished. It manages a lot of grit without getting pulpy, making the intensity of the viewing experience all the more genuine. Alderson-Clarke’s got the directing skills to pay the bills while also sporting fresh storytelling talent. Killing Boris Johnson will drop jaws and land inside your mind like a bolt of clever lightning."

Haiti has not been led by a bishop for nearly five years, because the outgoing bishop was credibly accused of manipulating an election to install his preferred successor.  In the absence of a bishop diocesan, the ecclesiastical authority of any diocese passes to the diocesan Standing Committee. The Rev. Mardoché Vil, who heads that committee in Haiti, is a fugitive, accused by Haitian police of trafficking weapons into a country where murderous gangs are better armed than the police.  The previous president of the Standing Committee, the Rev. Fritz Désiré, was arrested May 9 on similar charges.  Still being sought for arms trafficking is Vundla Sikhumbuzo, a Zimbabwean who worked as chief of operations for the diocese from 2011 until 2018. Vundla, who has been identified in multiple news reports as an international arms trafficker, was dismissed in 2018 after he allegedly attacked his wife with acid, leaving her disfigured. However, Vundla allegedly received several deposits of US$30,000 or more from the diocese as late as 2021.  These allegations began coming to light in August 2022, when the diocesan executive secretary and an accountant working for the diocese were arrested on arms-trafficking charges.  Virtually none of this has been reported in American news media. Most of the information comes from articles on Haitian news websites, some of them machine-translated from French.  Bishop Todd Ousley of the Office of Pastoral Development is the Church Center’s liaison with the Diocese of Haiti. In an email addressed to Vil on May 7, Ousley supported plans for a diocesan synod, or convention, to elect new members of the Standing Committee.  Ousley’s expression of support was denounced as “immoral and unacceptable” by the director general of the well-respected St. Vincent’s Center, an Episcopal institution that has provided educational opportunities and job training to children with disabilities since 1945.  “In encouraging President Vil to organize the Synod, [Ousley] did not underline anything about the current context in which Father Mardoché Vil is up to now being sought and pursued by the National Police of Haiti,” wrote the Rev. Irnel Duveaux in a letter to the St. Vincent’s board, which was forwarded to TLC by a priest in the diocese. Duveaux did not respond to a request for comment.  Ousley declined to be interviewed for this article. Public Affairs Officer Amanda Skofstad released a copy of the May 7 email, which appears at the bottom of this article. ”  “The point of the letter was to address the need for a synod to elect or re-elect members of the standing committee,” Skofstad said. “Since the current occupant of the office of president of the standing committee is Vil, the letter could only be addressed to him. Any use of the letter to promote political agendas within the Diocese of Haiti would be a misuse of the letter.”  She also released the following statement from Ousley:  “To the best of our knowledge, Père Jean Mardoché Vil is the duly elected standing committee president for the Episcopal Diocese of Haiti, and the validity of his service in that office is a matter to be determined by the diocese through its synod. As always, the clergy and people of the Diocese of Haiti are being held in prayer as they face various challenges within the church and Haitian society.”  However, two senior priests in the diocese have written to the national Department of Religious Affairs to say that a rival Provisional Standing Committee was elected by the clergy of the diocese in April. The six-person ad hoc committee was created to provide “honest and credible interlocutors without criminal records, capable of ensuring a responsible transition and doing everything possible to restore the image of this institution tarnished by the actions of a group of mercenaries.”  The letter, which also appears at the bottom of this article, names Duveaux, two other priests, and three lay people as members of the ad hoc committee. The letter provides an accounting, by name, of the votes cast for and against the committee by 59 priests in the diocese, and reports that 54 percent of the priests approved the committee.  Unsafe conditions have deteriorated in Haiti since the June 2021 assassination of President Jovenal Moïse. Prime Minister Ariel Henry, who was allegedly involved in the assassination, has since served as acting president.  “Violent gangs have effectively seized control of large swathes of the country,” according to a recent United Nations report, and rival gangs have engaged in armed combat, sexual violence, and kidnapping. Vigilantes have recently begun targeting the gangs. The BBC reports that 13 suspected gang members were beaten and burned to death in Port-au-Prince, the capital, in April.  The Diocese of Haiti reports nearly 98,000 baptized members, making it more than 30 percent larger by that measure than the Diocese of Texas, which ranks second. Because of societal violence and diocesan infighting, Haiti has had virtually no influence in recent years in the governance of the broader church.  The diocese has, however, had a remarkably broad role in Haitian society. The diocese owns more than 250 schools, as well as hospitals and higher-education facilities. L’Université Episcopale d’Haïti (UNEPH) educates about 2,500 students.  Haiti Letter to Pere Vil 5.7.23 by Kirk Petersen on Scribd  Ad Hoc Committee by Kirk Petersen on Scribd"

Even after formal warnings on September 15 and October 27, 2022, on January 30 of this year, a female Master Sergeant observed Teixeira “viewing content that was not related to his primary duty.”  Days later, amid a discussion of “fed cars sneaking around,” Teixeira fantasized about making an “assassination van.”  Nevertheless, even after three chances to stop all this, Teixeira was still actively stealing classified information for over a month after that, and as an earlier filing laid out, he offered to take requests about “happenings that pertain to your country” after that.  TEIXEIRA: Like to thank everyone who came to the thread about the current event, going on and participated and listen to me, cover set event since it’s beginning, I was very happy and willing and enthusiastic to have covered this event for the past year and share with all of you something that not many people get to see something very few people in fact, get to see, but despite all of this, I’ve decided to stop with the updates TEIXEIRA: If you guys do you want happenings that pertain to your country or events or politics or whatever you can DM me and I can tell you what I have, but it’s going to always be a brief summary TEIXEIRA: I can’t promise, speed or prompt response, but I will respond to you eventually so offers on the table. If you want to take it until then I’ll still be sticking around here still be posting shit, so not going anywhere don’t worry about that.  I suspect the non-response to these three incidents may be one reason the Commanding Officers of this base have been temporarily suspended and the entire unit stripped of its intelligence mission.  But the more important supplement for Teixeira’s ultimate fate may be this exchange from November 15.  Teixeira: I remember reading that on a TS network … Teixeira: I work in airforce intel … User: Would have been nice User: If you alerted us that a drone was heading to crash in the middle of a suburb of our capital? Teixeira: We did Teixeira: Just not that simple User: Official government statement was nobody said shit User: And nobody saw it Teixeira: Yeah I expect that to be the official statement Teixeira: My gov would have done the same downplay strategy User: What is a ts network Teixeira: Top secret … Teixeira: Like SCI noforn, hcs … User: What is being said now about this loose ukrainian missile? Teixeira: I mean I’m hoping to get back to work in the next week rn I have covid Teixeira: When I do get back however I will let u know  This exchange may be a response to this incident from the same day, when a Ukrainian air defense missile attempting to shoot down an incoming Russian attack went astray and killed two Poles (though Przewodów is nowhere near Warsaw).  If that’s right, by extrapolation this interlocutor must be have been presenting as a Pole. After Teixeira stated that he worked in Air Force intel with access to a Top Secret network, his interlocutor elicited information, challenged Teixeira’s response, then probed how much access Teixeira really had. Teixeira responded by telling someone presenting as a citizen of a NATO ally that he had access to compartmented information and HUMINT. Then the supposed Pole asked for more information.  And Teixeira agreed to get it for him.  Perhaps this presumed Pole was just shooting the shit in a gamer chat room. Or perhaps this guy was something else, someone with the training to know how to coax someone into greater and greater compromise.  Perhaps there were others in the chat room who saw all this go down and exploited the situation accordingly.  This filing, as the earlier one also did, specifies that these chats do not reflect the full extent of Special Agent Luke Church’s knowledge of the situation.  The interactions described above do not reflect all my knowledge on this matter or all relevant, inculpatory, or violent messages that I observed. They are instead offered to provide the Court with representative sample of certain messages attributable to TEIXEIRA.  Church might well be withholding the full context of these exchanges, too, perhaps withholding what happened after Teixeira went back to work after recovering from COVID.  Thus far, DOJ’s filings speak just of the existing charges against Teixeira, 18 USC 793(b) and (d). But this willful sharing of HUMINT with foreigners soliciting it — whether they really are citizens of a NATO ally or something else — gets a closer to espionage, an 18 USC 794 violation of the sort that can carry life imprisonment.  Update: dc-turtle suggests the drone could have been in Croatia, not Poland (which I’ve added to the title). It would still amount to Teixeira sharing information with someone presenting as a citizen of a NATO ally."

(Courtesy of bereaved family members of Park)  The Supreme Court of South Korea cleared a man who served 17 years in prison for allegedly spying for North Korea in 1975 of his charges in a retrial on Thursday.  Seoul's top court upheld an earlier ruling in 2022 that the evidence that originally put Park Ki-rae in jail for his breach of the National Security Act is not admissible, given that the investigative authorities during former President Park Chung-hee's military dictatorship had obtained the evidence and a confession by violating the defendant's human rights, through unlawful detention and torture.  During the military dictatorship, Seoul's anti-communist sentiment had continued to grow, particularly after the North's failed assassination attempt on the president in 1968, partly in order for the then-president to consolidate his control over South Koreans.  Defendant Park, a reunification activist, was one of the people arrested for attempting to rebuild a political party called the Unification Revolutionary Party, which the military junta had cracked down on after the revelation of party members' failed subversive activities against the then President Park in late 1960s.  Prosecutors then indicted him in 1974 for allegedly inviting others to join the party, illegally entering North Korea to communicate with North Koreans, conducting spying activities against Seoul and leaking military information.  Park was sentenced to death in April 1975. However, he ultimately served in total 17 years behind bars as his sentence was commuted several times until he was released on parole in 1991.  He continued his reunification activities after he was released from prison until he passed away in 2012.  This photo shows bereaved family members of the defendant Park Ki-rae, who was acquitted of spying charges in a Supreme Court verdict Thursday following a retrial. (Yonhap)  The defendant's bereaved family members sought a retrial of his case in 2018 in hopes of removing his criminal record, questioning the evidence's admissibility to the court. The retrial of the case began in 2020.  The prosecution, however, continued to seek life imprisonment for him, claiming that his statements to the court had been made with the help of his attorneys.  After the Supreme Court verdict, the defendant's son, Park Chang-seon, told reporters that it was ""exceptional and inappropriate for prosecutors to seek life imprisonment to a person who had endured torture and served 17 years of imprisonment unjustly,"" adding that Park was the first individual to be acquitted of spying accusations related to the Unification Revolutionary Party crackdown in a retrial.

OPCW inspectors are trained to use hazmat suits with a self-contained breathing apparatus.Credit: OPCW/Flickr (CC BY-ND 2.0)  The Hague, the Netherlands  The international body that banned chemical weapons is due to celebrate its first major milestone sometime this year — the completed destruction of the world’s declared stockpiles of banned substances. But at the organization’s brand-new facility in the Netherlands, scientists from around the world will continue its work to prevent, spot and respond to chemical warfare.  On 12 May, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) officially inaugurated its new Centre for Chemistry and Technology near The Hague, where the international body will bring together its existing laboratories and add new monitoring and training programmes.  Attacks in UK and Syria highlight growing need for chemical-forensics expertise  Although nearly all countries — except Egypt, Israel, North Korea and South Sudan — have officially renounced the use of chemical weapons under an international treaty called the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), such chemicals continue to be used illegally. The OPCW has played a central part in the response to crises: its investigators found that nerve gas and chlorine were used in the Syrian civil war during the past decade, for example, and in 2018 an OPCW team investigated the attempted assassination of a Russian dissident in the United Kingdom that involved a nerve agent called Novichok.  Historic step forward  The centre “will allow the OPCW to enhance the [lab] verification regime through maintaining and developing our knowledge, skills and expertise related to chemical weapons”, says OPCW director-general Fernando Arias.  “It was an historic step forward for the OPCW today,” said Paul Walker, a vice-chair of the board at the Arms Control Association, a non-governmental organization in Washington DC, after attending the 12 May launch. Although the OPCW’s monitoring work had been going on for more than a decade, the Syrian civil war catapulted it onto the global stage. “That began the whole process of realizing that we needed [the OPCW to have] much more expansive and expensive labs,” says Walker, who attended the inauguration on behalf of an umbrella organization called the CWC Coalition.  The new Centre for Chemistry and Technology is an upgrade compared with previous OPCW lab facilities.Credit: OPCW/Flickr (CC BY-ND 2.0)  “I think it will be a big deal for the OPCW,” says Alastair Hay, an environmental toxicologist at the University of Leeds, UK, who has been an OPCW adviser and conducts outreach training for the organization. “The previous lab facilities OPCW had were really quite limited,” he says. The lab will also enhance the organization’s ability to train researchers, he adds. The centre was built outside the OPCW’s normal budget, with €34 million (US$37 million) of voluntary contributions from 56 countries.  Stockpile disposal  Since 1997, the OPCW has had a mandate under the CWC to monitor countries’ compliance with the ban, which required signatories to stop producing chemical weapons, to declare their existing stockpiles and commit to destroying them. The organization has so far certified the destruction of more than 70,000 tonnes of chemical weapons, and it received the Nobel Peace Prize for its work in 2013. Of the eight countries that disclosed the possession of such weapons, seven have completed disposal. The eighth — the United States — expects to finish destroying its stockpile (mainly artillery containing mustard gas and nerve agents) in the next few months and is thought to be the last country to do so.  “We estimate that a large number of old and abandoned chemical weapons still remain undiscovered around the globe,” says OPCW spokesperson Elisabeth Waechter. For example, large numbers of rusting Japanese chemical weapons left over from the Second World War still await safe disposal in China. “While it is the responsibility of countries to destroy them safely, OPCW technical experts can provide advice — and verify the safe destruction.”  The CWC also compels state parties to report the production of chemicals that have a dual purpose — compounds that have legitimate uses but can also be used either as weapons or as ingredients to make them.  The OPCW analyses samples from chemical plants worldwide to search for evidence of the production of banned chemicals.Credit: OPCW/Flickr (CC BY-ND 2.0)  At the new centre, a warehouse is stocked with crates containing analytical-chemistry equipment ready to be dispatched around the world. As well as investigating alleged chemical-weapons attacks, the OPCW sends inspectors on routine missions to chemical facilities in member countries, often at short notice, to search for evidence of the production of banned chemicals. “Inspectors go to different sites and essentially audit what those particular sites have declared,” says Hay.  Samples brought back to The Hague are also sent to at least two international labs, to ensure that the results are cross-checked before they are reported to member countries. “It’s really important to be able to have access to really good facilities, where the results are incontrovertible,” Hay notes.  Novichok nerve agents banned by chemical-weapons treaty  These facilities are part of a network of 25 ‘OPCW-designated’ labs. The remit of the Centre for Chemistry and Technology includes putting labs through a periodic certification process to enable participation in the network. The centre also trains chemists from labs that want to match its standards and join the list. In an effort to provide knowledge to as many nations as possible, the OPCW is working on certifying labs in African countries for the first time: its current trainees include scientists from Algeria, Morocco, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa.  Increasing the labs’ geographical diversity can “build global capacity for the benefit of all regions and the international community as a whole”, Waechter says."

This “Saint James” should not to be confused with other Saint James’s. Nisibis, also known as Mtsbin, is a city in southern Turkey near the Syrian border, about 75 km SE of Dikranagerd. Christians of Nisibis, which included many Armenians, traced their Christian origins to Saint Thaddeus who, with Saint Bartholomew, preached and were martyred in Armenia prior to Armenia becoming the first nation to accept Christianity early in the 4th century.  In the 4th century Rome and Persia were contending for power in Armenia and the region. The Persian king sent an Armenian traitor, Anak, to assassinate Armenia’s king Khosrov and his family. Members of the Armenian court, enraged by their King’s assassination, killed Anak and all his family members that they could find. Anak’s son Gregory, however, escaped to Cappadocia where he was educated within its Christian community. Similarly, the murdered Armenian King Khosrov’s son, Drtad, was sent to Rome where he received an education as befitted a future king. Rome later returned Drtad to the Armenian throne. Passing through Cappadocia, Drtad and Gregory met and returned together to Armenia. Gregory converted Drtad, and the Armenian nation, to Christianity in 301 AD, becoming “Gregory the Illuminator”, founder of the Armenian church.

Ararat, Ararat summit in background  Hakob probably was related to Gregory, either as a cousin or nephew. Some sources indicate he too may have spent some time in Cappadocia. As a youth Hakob abandoned city life, devoting himself to religion, and living an austere existence in the mountains near Nisibis. He became known for his compassion, honesty, sincerity and strong sense of justice. When the bishop of the large Christian community of Nisibis died, the church fathers tried to convince Hakob to take the position, despite his lack of refinement. Numerous attempts to convince him finally succeeded.  Bishop Hakob of Nisibis participated in numerous Christian councils attended as well by representatives of the Armenian church, such as the Council of Nicaea in 325 AD which established the Nicene Creed, to which the Syriac and Armenian church adhered, and which is a fundamental profession of faith in the Armenian church. Byzantine emperor Constantine also attended the council and developed immense respect for Bishop Hakob.  Drawing of Surb Hakob Monastery, near Akori on Mt. Ararat, from reprint of “Journey to Ararat,” Friedrich Parrot, Harper & Brothers, NY, translated by W. D. Cooley, also available online  Hakob is reported to have performed many miracles. In one instance a couple of men asked him for a donation to help bury their friend who, faking death, was lying on the ground. Hakob said a prayer, after which the men, checking their friend on the ground, discovered that he was indeed dead. They beseeched Hakob to bring their friend back to life, which he did.  While traveling through a village, Hakob encountered a group of young women washing in a stream. They immodestly refused to cover themselves properly in the presence of a stranger. In response to a prayer by Surb Hakob, the stream dried up and the women’s hair turned white. The villagers urged Hakob to allow the stream to flow again, which he did, but the immodest women’s white hair remained.  Hakob urged a Persian judge to reconsider an unfair judgement which he had issued. The judge refused. When Surb Hakob, with a prayer, turned a stone into dust the judge reversed his decision.  Yenidogan village, next to Armenian cemetery on Mt. Ararat, at or near site of destroyed Akori village  Following the death of Byzantine Emperor Constantine in 337, the Persian Sassanid King Shapur II saw an opportunity to recapture territory Persia had previously lost to Rome. He attacked Roman held territories in upper Mesopotamia, Armenia, and in 338 attacked Nisibis. Hakob mounted Nisibis’ defensive walls and, praying, caused a swarm of insects to attack the large invading army which included war machines and elephants. The insects so irritated the soldiers and elephants that they caused the army to retreat. The Persian general, eyeing the tower upon which Surb Hakob stood, claimed he saw Emperor Constantine, who had previously died, leading the defense. The Persian assault failed.  Troubled by the weakening faith of his people, Surb Hakob desired to find Noah’s “redeeming Ark”. He determined that if he could retrieve and display a piece of the Ark from Mt. Ararat[1], this would bolster his people’s faith.  One variant of Sp. Hakob’s jourrney up Mt. Ararat is described by Pavstos Buzand[2], a 5th century Armenian historian. Other accounts differ slightly:  Sign, Hakobavank / Metsaranits Monastery, 7 to 8th c, Kolotak village, Artsakh  As Surb Hakob ascended the parched slope of Mt. Ararat, he with his colleagues grew tired and in need of water. They fell to the ground and prayed. A spring then gushed forth near Hakob’s head. According to Pavstos Buzand, “the spring, called Hakob’s spring, remains to this day”. Proceeding further up Mt. Ararat, near the summit, Hakob grew tired and fell asleep. An angel descended, left a piece of wood from the Ark near his head, and indicated that Hakob must search no further. As he descended the people around Ararat rejoiced at the presence of such a holy man who brought a gift of wood from the Ark. Surb Hakob then proceeded to visit the “great servant of the Armenian king”, Prince Manachir, near Lake Van whom he had heard was a merciless and unjust man. But Hakob hoped to soften Manachir’s heart and install in him fear of God. Instead, Prince Mananchir scorned Surb Hakob, throwing 800 innocent prisoners into the sea. Hakob, with his colleagues grieving for the innocent victims, journeyed to the base of a nearby mountain. Again, he prayed and a spring came forth from the ground. Climbing to the summit of the mountain, he cursed the realm of the prince causing the death of Prince Manachir, his wife, and his seven sons. According to another source, though, one of Manachir’s sons repented and thus survived.  View of Hakobavank, Metsaranits Monastery, Kolotak village, Artsakh.

Ararat, was built in 341 AD at the place where Hakob received the wood from the Ark. There may have been a church, St. James, in the nearby village of Akori[3]. The monastery was said to be of a cruciform plan with a central dome. In 1829 Baltic German explorer Friedrich Parrot, with Armenian writer Khachatur Abovian, were the first people known to summit Mt. Ararat. On the way to the summit, they visited Surb Hakob monastery which had engraved inscriptions dating to the 13th and 14th centuries. In the summer of 1840, an earthquake or volcanic explosion destroyed Surb Hakob monastery and the village of Akori. Many of the residents subsequently settled in Kamaris, a town in Kotayk province in the present Republic of Armenian. Currently the small Kurdish village of Yenidogan (“New Village”) is situated on or near the site of Akori. The monastery no longer exists, though there remain remnants of an Armenian cemetery with Armenian tombstones.  A number of Armenian churches and chapels named “Surp Hakob,” or equivalently “St. James of Nisibus” or “Saint James of Mtsbin”, exist. The history of some of these churches remains obscure.

Monastery contains two churches  About a mile outside the village of Kolotak, Martakert Province, in Artsakh (Nagorno Karabagh) is Hakobavank, founded in the 5th to 7th centuries, which underwent modifications until the 12th c. In the 14th century the monastery became an important center of the region of Mets Arank, acquiring the name of Metsaranits Monastery. Between the 9th and 18th centuries the buildings were modified and maintained, with relics of Sp. Hakob kept until the 19th century. The monastery contains two churches, rooms for clergy, and in the Middle Ages was a pilgrimage site for Armenians in Eastern Armenia.  In 2022 a renovation project was initiated to restore a workable place of worship for the villagers, and refugees settling in Kolotak coming from areas of Artsakh now occupied by Azerbaijan. The monastery is also an archaeological and architectural site, with an inscription dating to 853 and medieval water pipes made of clay and wooden branches on the ground. A description of the completed Hakobavank restoration project can be seen on the reArmenia web page at https://rearmenia.com/en/collaborations/lets-restore-the-hakobavank-monastery?tab=updates .  Surb Hakob died either in 338 or 350 and is buried in the Church of Saint Jacob in Nisibis. A fragment of wood from the Ark resides in the museum at Echmiadzin. In the Armenian Apostolic Church, Surb Hakob of Nisibis’ holiday is celebrated on the Saturday between December 12 to 18.  [1] Early accounts cite the Ark as having landed on Mt. Qardu, southern Turkey, in a region called “Kordukh” in Armenian.  [2] See “The Epic Histories (Buzandaran Patmut’iwnk)” translated by Nina Garsoian, Harvard University Press, 1989 or Robert Bedrosian’s translation at https://archive.org/details/HistoryOfTheArmeniansByPawstosBuzand_569  [3] Akori was an Armenian village on the NE slope of Mt. Ararat at 5,719 feet altitude, near the border with the current Armenian Republic. The earthquake of 1840 destroyed the village and Surb Hakob monastery. In 481 AD a force of 400 Armenians routed a force of 7,000 Persians in the Battle of Akori. Akori was visited by explorers James Brice, Friedrich Parrot with Khachaur Abovian, and H.F.B. Lynch.

HARRIS: Hello, and welcome to Washington Post Live. I’m Shane Harris. I’m a senior intelligence and national security reporter here at The Post, and I’m very pleased to be joined today by three of the people behind Showtime’s new spy drama airing May 19th, “Ghosts of Beirut.” I’m here with the co-creators of the show, Greg Barker and Avi Issacharoff, as well as one of the lead actresses from the series, Dina Shihabi.  Hi, everyone. Welcome. Thanks for being here.  MS. SHIHABI: Hi. Thanks for having us.  MR. BARKER: Hi.  MR. ISSACHAROFF: Hi.  MR. HARRIS: It's great to see you, and congratulations on the series, which I've been watching and really enjoying. Greg, I want to start with you. This show centers on, I guess, the ghost of Beirut, a man who many people probably are going to be unfamiliar with, Imad Mughniyeh. Tell us a bit about this individual who notably was responsible for the deaths of more Americans in terrorist attacks than anyone before 9/11. Who is he, and why is he important?  Advertisement  MR. BARKER: Well, he's one of the most fascinating characters I've ever come across. I mean, he is--he was a man who from age 19, 21, outwitted the CIA, the Mossad, and rose to incredible prominence in the Middle East as a key player in the region from nowhere. And he drove the agency and Mossad sort of, kind of crazy because they couldn't find him. They didn't even know what he looked like.  And his story plays out over two-and-a-half decades, and my view is he actually shaped the modern CIA, as we know it, from what happened in the 1980s, which then resonates in the mid-2000s. So he was complicated. He was a guy from a poor--regular family, poor neighborhood, started working as a as a bodyguard to Yasser Arafat in Beirut in the late '70s, early '80s. Kind of when the PLO left Beirut, he sort of found--I think sort of found an opening, was also recruited by Iranian intelligence, and kind of stepped into a void and used that and exploited that to his own ends and became, I think, sort of more powerful and more influential at an extremely young age than he ever imagined.  MR. HARRIS: Yeah. And it's a really--it's a very detailed portrait of how he rises into this, you know, position where he is really present for just an enormous amount of attacks that people remember from history, even if they've forgotten some of the details.  Advertisement  Avi Issacharoff, let me ask you, what was it about Imad's story that drew you to it and why you wanted to tell it visually this way?  MR. ISSACHAROFF: Well, for me, I was kind of longtime reporter, journalist, analyst for Middle East issues working for Haaretz newspaper back in 2006 when the Israeli-Lebanese war--the second war in Lebanon started. And I covered the war as a journalist, of course, and later on, I published a book that was called ""34 Days"" together with Amos Harel. And I researched Hezbollah in Lebanon, and through the research, you know, I got familiar more with a very prominent figure inside Hezbollah, who was the head of the military wing inside Hezbollah, Imad Mughniyeh.  Later on, I wrote my thesis in my master degree in Middle Eastern studies about Hezbollah and Iranian connection, and over there, again, the name of Imad Mughniyeh was mentioned over and over again. Wherever I looked, wherever I researched, Imad Mughniyeh was this kind of a figure. So it became for me a kind of, almost an obsession, a white whale or whatever you want to call it.  Advertisement  And when I understood the personal story behind his life--his wife, his kid, the brother, the brother-in-law, everything that happened with him and the CIA and the Mossad, so you understand that you're dealing with a real dramatic story. It's not only about the terrorist that is operating in the Middle East, but this is someone way, way bigger than what you would expect from someone like that: so young, so ambitious, and still someone who managed to change the face of the Middle East and the terror as we know it, the world of terror as we know it today.  MR. HARRIS: Now, Dina Shihabi, you play a CIA officer named Lena in the series who essentially is a targeter. She's someone who is trying to find Imad Mughniyeh and is really kind of a second generation of CIA officers who've been looking for him. So talk a little bit about how you prepared for that role, and what did you know, if anything, about Mughniyeh and his story before you came to the series?  MS. SHIHABI: Not much. I had met Avi a couple of years ago, and he mentioned this story to me, and I, you know, kind of dug in a little bit. But up until I got the scripts, it wasn't a story I was that familiar with, and I was quite taken by his impact and also by his human story of--you know, his downfall is really him falling in love, and I found that so moving, because it's so easy to look at these stories in a vacuum and to see someone as a monster.  Advertisement  But when you actually go back to the history, you see what was happening in Beirut at the time and the Middle East, there really is a cause-and-effect of why someone like him makes the choices that he does and becomes who he is, and, you know, there's always a hero and a villain, depending on which side of the story you're on. And I think he was a hero to many and to himself, and the CIA was the villain and vice versa. And so I just found that the story itself was actually quite fascinating, like Greg said, an incredibly fascinating person.  When I got the part--when I was offered the part, I told Greg I wanted to be connected with as many people as possible, and he really rose for the occasion and sent me every book and every contact. And there were two women, in particular, that had an immense impact on me--Hanin Ghaddar, who's a journalist, a Shia Lebanese journalist who lives in Washington, D.C.; and then a woman who's an ex-CIA targeter. And I just spoke to them at lengths and asked them, you know, uncomfortable, intimate questions that they were very generous with.  And Hanin, in particular, had an effect on me because of her anger. I think people forget when you're looking at it from a Western perspective that Arabs get affected by someone like Imad Mughniyeh as much as the West does, maybe even more. And her anger towards what's happened in Lebanon and her--how important that was for Lena to channel that anger really stayed with me for the project.  Advertisement  MR. HARRIS: Was there anything you learned from the former CIA officer that really stuck with you as you were trying to think about how to play Lena in this and how to take on the role?  MS. SHIHABI: Yeah. You know, when I first got the scripts, Lena had a--Lena, it stayed with her, had a lot of, like I said, anger, passion. She really follows her instincts. She stood up for herself a lot, and one thing that the CIA targeter told me is there's only so far you can go until you get taken off a project. If you're too obsessed, too passionate, pushing back too much, you'll get fired, or you'll get taken off of that particular mission and put somewhere else.  And so Greg and I met when I first got to Morocco and really found the middle ground of that, found the place where she had the personality, she had had that fuel, that fire, but was smart, good at her job, knew what her boundaries were. And I just--I think that her coming across as someone good at her job was very important to me and important to--as a promise to this woman.  Advertisement  MR. HARRIS: Greg, for those who are, you know, maybe too young to remember, really, some of the--just the awful attacks that occurred in the Middle East in the '80s that Imad Mughniyeh was behind, give us kind of a rundown of some of the more notorious events that he played a role in.  MR. BARKER: It's extraordinary. In fact, if you glean through history books of that era, it's like his work is throughout, even though at the time it wasn't widely known.  So there's an initial suicide bombing on an Israeli base in Tyre, soon followed by an attack, massive attack on the United States embassy in 1983 in Beirut, which killed hundreds of people and wiped out the entire CIA station at the time, including--well, I won't give away--but one of the very, very prominent CIA officers who was on the cusp of what he hoped was a Middle East peace plan, a regional peace plan; TWA bombing attack on the--TWA hijacking, attack on the marine barracks, hostage taking.  Advertisement  You think about Beirut hostage crisis mid-80s, it was all Mughniyeh, including the kidnapping of the CIA station chief, William Buckley, which is portrayed in Episode 2, which really sort of brought the agency to its knees. And the list goes on and on, Argentina, more recent attacks in Hungary on Jewish--which was in [unclear], right, Avi? And then he was a military strategist, so he was the architect of Hezbollah's military strategy. A hundred thousand small missiles, that was all Mughniyeh.  Behind the scenes, there was no--there was no image of him, no photograph of him for decades. All the agency and Mossad had were--was his passport photo from when he was probably 15 years old, because we know he went to Iran with Arafat as a young guy, so--and that was it. And that's part of our story is how do they even--not even know where he is or what does he look like.  And so it's extraordinary, and you sort of can go back and look through that whole period of history and see Mughniyeh's fingerprints all over it, including then against U.S. forces in Iraq, which is how Lena comes into the story and the--and the story--the series begins with an audacious attack on American compound in Iraq in 2007 with a bunch of guides dressed like U.S. soldiers drive into a compound and kidnap American soldiers, hoping to trade them for some Iranian diplomats. And that kicks off everything and, in fact, was what led to the final unraveling of his identity, that one incident in Iraq in 2007.  Advertisement  MR. HARRIS: Yeah. The breadth of his career, really. I mean, it's astonishing, and I mean, it's--for those of us who kind of grew up in that time too, who do remember these things, I mean, these were on the news and featuring very prominently, and they were--kind of became almost sort of a background noise, as I remember it, of these just constant attacks. And it's incredible to think about one person being behind so much of it.  Avi, let me ask you. I mean, part of the compelling part of this narrative is not just that Imad has this hand in all these brutal attacks, but that he is just--he is a ghost. I mean, he is--the ""father of smoke,"" I think is one of the terms that people gave to him. How was he able to outwit the CIA and Mossad for so long and go without being captured?  MR. ISSACHAROFF: Well, I think that if you would talk to Mossad and CIA agents or handlers, officers, you would hear more of the same, like he was the best. I mean, yeah, you had bin Laden, of course, and bin Laden was, in a very twisted way, talented in what he did. But Imad Mughniyeh was one level up, if not two levels up. He was so sophisticated and smart and clever. He was very careful about his identity. He used nicknames all the time. He switched identities. He traveled to Iran. He traveled to Central America. He traveled to Africa. He met Osama bin Laden in Khartoum, Sudan, using a fake passport, and he was very smart about, you know, the way that he managed to maneuver everyone.  Even when he got into Beirut, even when he got into his own neighborhood, people didn't know who he was, because he stayed an enigma, because he managed to keep his identity as a kind of a--as an organizational secret. No one knew who he was, really, till the later days, of course, that he became more and more strong, popular, and then a very small group knew about his identity and how does he look like.  I think that when you understand that the two agencies needed to collaborate--and they failed when they tried to pull it separately. Over and over, they failed in trying to get to him, but when they managed to collaborate and to go together into this first-ever joint assassination operation of the CIA and the Mossad, this is where the success came from, including finding out about the way that he looks, including about reaching his whereabouts, and of course, executing the assassination.  MR. HARRIS: Yeah, it really is a tremendous joint operation, and it took, you know, decades really, didn't it, to pull it off?  And that obsession really of the CIA and of, you know, Mossad to try and find him, it comes through. And, Dina, there's one scene in particular from the first episode where you are interrogating an Iranian official, trying to just extract some information out of him to help put together the puzzle. Let's watch that clip right now, actually.  [Video plays]  MR. HARRIS: It's just a great scene of the cat-and-mouse between the two of you. It's really great, and it--how do you empathize with this and her challenge of trying to find this man who she's been, you know, clearly hunting with her colleagues for so long?  MS. SHIHABI: It goes back to what I was saying about wanting to be--there's a part of her, I think, that just wants to be the best. Obviously, there's a personal--you know, she's Shia. She's Lebanese. She grew up with stories of Lebanon and what happened to it and Hezbollah from her parents. And so there's a really deep part of her that has a connection to this. But beyond that, she is great at her job, and she wants to win.  And something Greg told me about early on is that there was a sort of ruthlessness to people that have her job, that they're after something, and they're going to do whatever it takes to get it. And doing this scene, in particular, was really fun because I wanted to find the ways in which she could connect to him and charm him and make him trust her and make him feel like they had something in common, which was all manipulative.  I don't think she's genuinely having those feelings, but she knows--she knows what her power is in that situation, and she's using it. And I think the guy--you know, plus, the guy playing Asgari is a brilliant actor, and it was really just great to have that back-and-forth with him.  MR. HARRIS: Yeah. And it really is--I know in talking to CIA officers and the reporting I do, you have to build rapport with people, even with people who you might find, you know, repugnant or dangerous.  MS. SHIHABI: Yeah.  MR. HARRIS: Now, you were born in Saudi Arabia and spent part of your youth, I think, in Beirut. How did those memories and your experience in Lebanon inform how you approached the role? Were you able to draw from that in putting your performance together?  MS. SHIHABI: Oh, yeah. I think it just seeps into your body, the fact that I have a connection to the place. I know what it feels like and smells like. I know what the--what it's like to walk down the street and experience the people, and so it just was an inherent part of--it's an inherent part of me, and so it just became an inherent part of what I brought to the character, something I didn't have to work for.  There's a moment in which I'm looking towards where Lebanon would be, and that's a very real moment. I know what it feels like to be there. I love Beirut. If I could live there, I would. I think it's an incredible place.  MR. HARRIS: Yeah. And the love for Beirut and the kind of the romanticism of it does--is something that comes through in the story really effectively, I think.  Now, Avi, in terms of the narrative of this story, it's told from the perspective of, you know, the Iranians, the Lebanese, the CIA, the Mossad, and you're really moving around from all these perspectives. You know, talk a little bit about how you construct that as a storyteller and why you felt it was important to tell it from, you know, these multiple points of view.  MR. ISSACHAROFF: You know, there's a kind of a cliché in script writing that says that the better the villain, the better the movie, meaning, you know, you need to make your bad guy, the terrorist, the one that is--that has killed hundreds of people, innocent people--you need to make him more interesting than just a kind of a villain, just a kind of a simple, bad guy.  This is what we did in ""Fauda,"" Lior Raz, the other co-creator of ours and us--and me in ""Fauda,"" and this is what we tried to pull here also with Greg, trying to show the other narrative, trying to show the other side. And one of the things that really struck--struck us is not only the fact that, yes, of course, as every human being, you have kind of a more complicated character than just good and evil. But one of the things that really made us understand that we have a real drama is to understand that the process that the Mossad and the CIA went through in order to reach their obsession, in order to get to the bad guy, they were willing to do horrifying things, including things that we might call as terrorist attacks.  1985, Bir al-Abed, southern suburb of Beirut, there's a car bomb exploding at the entrance to a mosque, a Shiite mosque that is led by Sheikh Fadlallah, in an attempt that was pulled by the CIA and probably some Phalanges in order to kill Sheikh Fadlallah and Imad Mughniyeh himself. Eighty-five people--most of them were innocent--got killed in this explosion. So this is horrible to think about.  Then later on, something that we didn't get into the show, but 1995, the Mossad pulls out a horrifying operation killing the brother of Imad Mughniyeh that wasn't really involved in Hezbollah, just in order to get Imad to the funeral and then to kill him over there. And by the way, Imad didn't get to the funeral. So you understand that the price at both sides, Mossad and the CIA, are paying in what they do is that actually it's eating their moral from the inside. You lose your own morality when you go on a war against the terrorist like Imad Mughniyeh.  MR. HARRIS: Yeah. Greg--  MR. BARKER: And then for--  MR. HARRIS: Sorry.  MR. BARKER: For Dina's character and her counterpart in the Mossad, they're grappling with that history themselves, and how do we carry out this sort of joint assassination without succumbing to these horrible accidents that their agencies committed in the past? And that's kind of the driving force for the back end of the series, but the history is alive in them and the institutions there within.  MR. HARRIS: Right. And there's even that--  MS. SHIHABI: And the--  MR. HARRIS: Yeah. Sorry. I'm sorry, Dina. Please go ahead.  MS. SHIHABI: No, I was just reiterating what Greg said is that that's something we talked about a lot. You know, you--when you're working for the CIA or the Mossad, you're carrying the mistakes that have been made along--you know, it's part of your history. It's the consequence of what they all come into this moment in time with, and so I think they're--you know, Teddy and Lena are trying to do better, but I think their morality gets in question too. I don't think you get to kill someone without your soul getting destroyed in some way, no matter what.  MR. HARRIS: Yeah. And there--  MR. ISSACHAROFF: I think that's one of the--  MR. HARRIS: The car bomb you mentioned, Avi, one of the CIA officers, in fact, says to his boss, if we do this, we're going to pay a price for it. So he's warning them, isn't he?  MS. SHIHABI: Mm-hmm.  MR. BARKER: Yeah. That's right.  MR. ISSACHAROFF: You know that towards the end, that really happened in reality, according to the research that we did. You know that right before they executed the assassination, there was a kind of a gathering in the headquarters where they pulled the operation, and there was a demand from the people in charge on both sides, from all the people that were around them: After we execute the assassination, no one is going to clap his hands. No one is going to cheer up or anything like that. This is a man, and we're going to take people's life. And this is what happened in reality. People didn't clap their hands or cheer up after the assassination.  MR. HARRIS: And, Greg, talk a little bit about the research for this show. When the show opens, you point out that this is a story based on deeply--it's a fictional version of ""deeply researched""--I think is the word you use--historical events. So how did you all go about piecing this together and choosing when to insert, you know, fictional characters and then real-life characters? How did you go about that?  MR. BARKER: It was a long and very intellectually stimulating process. Avi and I and our team spent at least six months and longer researching this by talking to people directly. There's really not a book or a series of articles we could just rely on. We did our own research.  And I found that by talking to people who may have been involved and saying, look, we--it was clear they couldn't go on the record, because they're just--they couldn't say anything of substance on the record. But what I said is like, look, we're going to--we're going to fictionalize a lot of this, but we want it to be as authentic as possible, so tell me what you think happened or what might have happened. And then people like opened up, and then we got all this interesting, really amazing details, a lot of which found a way in the scripts and different perspectives. Like the CIA would say we built the bomb and we constructed it, and the Mossad was like, no, we built the bomb. So we kind of had to choose our own path through it.  MR. HARRIS: Yeah.  MR. BARKER: Choose our own truth. It was--and it was great. I mean, Showtime gave us the time to do this and to really sort of dig in deep, and then constructing it into a narrative was--you know, was challenging because there's so much information, but that's part of the fun as well. And it was--yeah, it was an extremely intellectually, sort of satisfying process.  MR. HARRIS: Yeah.  MR. ISSACHAROFF: And part of the fun was to understand that, you know, what Greg had just mentioned that, you know, Mossad is saying we did it, CIA is saying, no, we did it, and it's a kind of a competition. But even when they pulled this thing together, they had some arguments. They had some, you know, disagreements, including one of the picks of the show, which is the argument about whether to kill Qasem Soleimani, the head of Quds force in the Revolutionary Guard, Iranian Revolutionary Guards, yes or no, because he was walking together with Imad Mughniyeh, and then you come to the question of should we execute the assassination, then kill Qasem Soleimani or not? The Israelis were in favor; the Americans were completely against. And at the end of the day, the Americans--the Israelis followed the Americans, and they did not execute the assassination of both of them.  MR. BARKER: Yeah. It was really satisfying to get into--to try to unpack that intelligence relationship, which is very complicated and has--I mean, it goes all the way back to the '80s in Beirut, and to kind of get inside that was dramatically--was, you know, fun and I think very authentic and will be eye-opening to people.  MR. HARRIS: And, Greg, did you find that people were perhaps--maybe not many on the record, but were willing from the CIA and Mossad to talk about this, and how much do they officially acknowledge publicly today about the role that their services played in ultimately killing Mughniyeh?  MR. BARKER: Officially, at least as far as the CIA, nothing.  Yeah. I mean, I actually came to the story a decade ago by doing a--when I was doing a project on the hunt for bin Laden for HBO, and a number of senior people then were telling me that their true obsession was Mughniyeh and Hezbollah, which dated back to their time in Beirut in the mid-'80s, so--and it goes--I found people willing to talk about it off the record and go into--because it--the wounds, the emotional scars run very, very deep, to the highest levels.  But what was interesting is a lot of the people who were young officers on the ground in the Middle East, often in Beirut in the mid-'80s, after 9/11 are in senior management positions and are making decisions at that time informed by the searing, sort of emotional turmoil that they went through back early in their career.  So they wanted to talk. Officially, we--you know, I sort of knocked on the front door of the agency and was like, ""What can you tell us?"" and the word came back, ""Nothing.""  [Laughter]  MS. SHIHABI: So then we did our own.  MR. HARRIS: I can sympathize with that experience covering the CIA.  MR. BARKER: Yeah  MR. HARRIS: You unearthed a remarkable amount of detail, though. It's really quite extraordinary.  Din, I'll put our last question to you. What do you want people to take away from this series? So much of it is about history, but it's such a deeply emotional and, in many ways, actually quite empathetic story about Imad Mughniyeh, which is really challenging, I think. So what do you want people to walk away from with this story?  MS. SHIHABI: I mean, that's what's--that was so beautiful about the scripts to begin with was that it's a really character-based, character-driven story, and I think you get to spend time with everyone in a way that shows their humanity and also shows their flaws. And that's always going to be the best story that's told when you finish watching something and you feel empathy towards the person that you might have thought was just a monster, and you have complicated feelings towards the people that you thought were just the hero. And you leave, I think, with a more expansive view of people and who they become because of their circumstances and their choices.  And I hope it reflects back on to, you know, the viewers themselves, which we all have parts of ourselves that are--because of generational trauma, because of what we went through in our adolescence or--it's just we are complicated. We're contradictory. We're--no one is simplistic. And I think this show does a really good job in giving you that feeling by the end of it.  MR. HARRIS: And I would think as an actor too, those are really some of the most satisfying kinds of roles to play too, right?  MS. SHIHABI: Oh, yeah, absolutely. I mean, every role has that in it, and then it takes good writers like Greg, Avi, and Joëlle to really put it on the page and bring it to life. And then I just have to, you know, make sense of it all on the day. [Laughs]  MR. HARRIS: Well, you all did a great job of that, truly, in a very complex and emotional story.  So it's unfortunately all the time we have to talk about it. The series drops on May 19th, ""Ghosts of Beirut."" Thank you to Avi Issacharoff and Greg Barker, the co-creators--  MR. ISSACHAROFF: Thank you.  MR. HARRIS: --and Dina Shihabi, the actor in the role of Lena. Thank you so much for joining us to talk about it today. It was a really great conversation.  MS.

Renczkowski is the wife of transgender teacher Ashlee Belle Renczkowski, who has been the center of the Fox Chapel incident. Renczkowski also serves as the Middle School Director on the executive leadership Board of the Hernando County teacher’s union. Renczkowski said she came to “speak the truth because  so few have decided the truth is worth listening to.” She went on to say that the “far-right extremists and hate groups would prefer fake news and misinformation, halftruths,  and whole lies, hyperbole in anything that promotes us being pawns in their political game.” Quoting John 8:32, in which Jesus said, “The truth will set you free,” Renczkowski said, “Here I am, doing the Lord’s work.” She went on to say:  “The truth is that many people don’t care what happened at Fox Chapel. They don’t care what she (the teacher) did or didn’t say. They only care about pushing a false narrative to further their cause. Many teachers are removed from the classroom, but none make local or national headlines, so why did she?  Because she’s different and doesn’t conform to the status quo. It’s clear in every headline why she was targeted. She found happiness in herself, and she lives her truth, and hate groups can not stand it.  They’d rather she be dead than exist in front of students, and that’s what their goal for the last year has been. To bully her and push her to a breaking point. The truth is we’ve been under attack for the last year by a local hate group that targeted her for being different.  - Advertisement -  Neither of us fits their idea of this emotionless robot of a teacher who doesn’t make connections with their students but only teaches content. So we’re a threat to them, not because of what we’ve done or said, but who we are.  The truth is we’ve been harassed online and in person, bullied, and threatened because of a false claim, because of a lie. The truth is we asked for help from some of the School Board members who are praised and put on a pedestal by these hate groups, and they ignored our pleas. They claim not to support bullying but have promoted our mistreatment, even contributing to it.  The truth is so many we have faithfully served for over a decade betrayed us and turned their backs on us because it was easier to believe the lies than using reading comprehension skills and draw conclusions on their own. They let these hateful people write the narrative and attempt to destroy lives because it was easier to play victim than to look at reality.  The truth is, she never threatened anyone. One person’s word is not fact unless backed up by the evidence, and everyone involved in the investigation said there was no threat. They said this was a mental health report and would be treated as such.  The truth is someone betrayed their badge and promise to serve and protect because it was more important to hurt someone because they’re different.  The truth is, everyone who knows her knows she’d never say or do such a thing, and we are all hurting from the character assassination carried out this last month.  The truth is students feel safe with her. They love her, and miss her, and can not wait for her to come back. They see her differences in love and respect her. They know she’d stand in harm’s way to protect them, and she has her whole career.  The truth is, the few of you who will only believe the lies will hear me tonight. And you haven’t believed for the last month when the truth was the truth was clear and evident.  You’d rather us leave and be gone to stop serving our purpose and caring for our students. But we will not stop. We will continue to fight for our students and love them despite the attacks. Because the truth is we love our students, and they need us now more than ever.  And finally, the truth is, this could happen to anyone. No one is safe in this hateful social-political climate, So please be kind, as you never know what someone is going through. And thank you to those who have supported us and seen the truth. You have held us above water as people have tried to drown us. We’re forever grateful.”"

A minister in Punjab province claimed Khan was sheltering dozens of people, who allegedly attacked state and military property. The ex-cricket star, who denies the allegations, was given until 2 p.m. local time, Thursday, to hand over the suspects.  This marks a further escalation in the showdown between Khan, 70, and the military that has an outsized influence on security and domestic politics. In recent days, the army has publicly condemned those who they have identified as Khan supporters for instigating last week’s attacks and vowed to try the perpetrators in military courts.  “This is the most unprecedented crackdown,” Khan told the UK’s Channel 4 in an interview posted on Thursday morning. “In 27 years of my party’s existence, we have never indulged in violent protests, now 7,500 people have been arrested in my party. All the senior leadership has been arrested.”  Khan has called for a judicial commission headed by the chief justice to probe the attacks on state and military property. He has warned the government may take the next step of banning his party since it has started calling the group a terrorist organization.  “There are no raid or arrest plans as of now. The deployment is normal and routine,” a Lahore police spokesman said by phone. Khan’s residence already had a heavy police contingent present outside for security but this was also the scene of at least two other attempts to arrest him in March.  Firebrand  The politician, known for his firebrand speeches, was dramatically arrested last Tuesday in the country’s capital Islamabad by paramilitary troops in relation to a corruption case. The Supreme Court later ordered his release calling his detention illegal and Khan’s legal team has obtained protective bail for scores of cases to prevent another arrest.  At least eight people were killed and hundreds injured in the clashes that broke out between Khan’s supporters and security forces following his arrest. The escalating political crisis takes place as Pakistan faces its worst economic distress in decades, including Asia’s fastest inflation, and is struggling to revive a $6.7 billion International Monetary Fund bailout.  Khan was ousted as premier by a no confidence vote in April last year and has since sought to return to power by pushing for early elections. His rival, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, rejected his demands and said the government will complete its term that ends in August.  To force national polls, Khan has pushed for by-elections and his party has dissolved the provincial assemblies in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where it has majorities. The government has refused to hold those polls, saying there’s inadequate funds and these provincial elections should be held at the same time as the national vote later this year.  Khan remains wildly popular with Pakistanis, with an opinion survey showing that a majority blame the current government for the economic crisis and the tough IMF reforms. His appearance at rallies often draws tens of thousands of people.  It was at one such rally in November that Khan was shot in the leg. He blamed the government and the military for orchestrating an assassination attempt, which they have strongly denied. Things came to a head earlier in May when Khan revived those allegations at a weekend gathering and on social media, prompting the military to have a very public war of words with him before his arrest last week.  Khan’s allegations stem from Pakistan’s own history where no prime minister has served a full five-year term in office. Those who lasted more than two years were either exiled or killed, including Benazir Bhutto, who was assassinated in December 2007 during a campaign stop in an attack similar to the one against Khan in November.  “They are too scared for elections because they are scared I will win,” Khan later told Al Jazeera, referring to the military and the ruling coalition. “They are doing everything to make sure I am out of the election race.”  (Recasts lead, updates throughout)  ©2023 Bloomberg L.P."

İnce said that the tape was a deepfake—“This is not my private life, it’s slander,” he said, according to The Guardian, claiming that the footage had been ripped from an “Israeli porn site”—but he dropped out of the race regardless, citing a longer campaign of character assassination. “What I have seen in these last forty-five days, I have not seen in forty-five years,” he said. The supposed sex tape was not the only occasion on which claims of technological deception had surfaced during the campaign. Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, the main opposition candidate, accused Russia (without offering specifics) of weaponizing deepfake technology to boost Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the incumbent president. And, at a rally, Erdoğan played footage that had been manipulated to suggest close ties between Kılıçdaroğlu and the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, which the US and EU have branded a terrorist group.  According to the BBC, İnce also said that he was dropping out to avoid being blamed for splitting the anti-Erdoğan vote. At the time, pundits deemed it a live possibility that, despite İnce’s slender support, his withdrawal could put a nail in Erdoğan’s coffin after twenty years in power—with days to go until the vote, Kılıçdaroğlu was polling just one percentage point shy of the fifty-percent threshold needed to win the election outright. But the results would paint a different picture: as the official count neared completion, it was Erdoğan who sat just shy of that threshold, with Kılıçdaroğlu further back on forty-five percent of the vote. (In confidently predicting Erdoğan’s demise, many pundits, Sinan Ciddi and Steven A. Cook wrote for Foreign Policy, indulged “too much focus on polls” and “too much Twitter navel-gazing.” Sound familiar?) The election is now set for a runoff on May 28. Erdoğan is expected to prevail—despite having overseen an economic crisis, deepening political authoritarianism, and the botched response to the massive earthquake that devastated southern Turkey and neighboring Syria in February.  Among other groups, the stakes of the election have been particularly acute for Turkey’s press, which has seen its freedom to report systematically eroded under Erdoğan. While the election was mostly considered to be free, it was also in many respects unfair—not least due to Turkey’s deeply skewed media environment. After the first round, observers led by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe deemed that “continued restrictions on fundamental freedoms of assembly, association and expression hindered the participation of some opposition politicians and parties, civil society and independent media in the election process.”  As the election unfolded, I spoke with my colleague Pesha Magid, who has covered Turkey, including for CJR; in March, she profiled a reporter who had tracked the aftermath of, and political fallout from, the earthquake. We talked about the context for the vote, the threats that journalists faced in covering it, and what a victory for Erdoğan or Kılıçdaroğlu would respectively mean for press freedom. Our typed conversation has been lightly edited for clarity.    You recently wrote for CJR about Murat Bayram, a reporter in Turkey who covered the aftermath of the devastating earthquake that hit that country and Syria earlier this year. How did the upcoming election play into your—and his—reporting? And how has the earthquake aftermath affected the election—and the coverage of it—since then?  Since the earthquake, I think the election has been lurking at the back of most people who cover Turkey’s minds. The failure of the government’s earthquake response caused a backlash of anger from communities that would normally support Erdoğan’s Justice and Development Party (AKP). Many survivors were first-hand witnesses to the government’s fatal mismanagement of the emergency response, waiting days for lifesaving rescue teams to show up. Over fifty thousand people died in the earthquake. Many of those deaths could have been prevented either through a competent rescue effort or through the government enforcing building codes.  Sign up for CJR 's daily email  Murat Bayram witnessed for himself some of the anger on the streets when he was reporting on the earthquake. He spoke about people who were asking where the government and the media were. I don’t think anyone has forgotten the earthquake or the images that spread on social media of people waiting for their loved ones to be rescued from the rubble. There’s an odd symmetry with Erdoğan’s own rise to power, which followed another devastating earthquake in 1999 and a bungled response from the government of the time. One of Erdoğan’s electoral promises back then was to do better on earthquake preparedness.  The coverage of the election in Turkey has been a complicated topic as the vast majority of major news organizations have been co-opted by the government and no longer provide independent or critical reports. Much of the government-affiliated press took the line that the earthquake was an unpreventable disaster and that the government was doing the best it could. They blamed scapegoats for some of the worst failures. Election coverage has followed a similar pattern of most major channels supporting the AKP, while a slim slice of independent media has been providing more critical coverage.  Going into the election, what were the stakes for the Turkish press?  Under Erdoğan, Turkey has become one of the world’s worst jailers of journalists. Journalists are commonly beaten, harassed, or targeted with legal cases. Only a scattered few small outlets remain independent. The stakes were the freedom of the press as a whole.  Did we see any repression of the press linked directly to election coverage? And how did this affect the way in which the first round of the election was conducted?  The short answer is yes. Since May 9, at least four journalists have been found guilty of terrorism charges, while others have faced beatings and harassment during their work.  On May 10, a journalist named Muhammed Yavaş posted a critique of the Grey Wolves, a hypernationalist group, on Facebook, only to then be beaten up by a local leader of the group. In a joint statement on May 10, the monitoring organizations Human Rights Watch and Article 19 warned of the Turkish government’s history of online censorship and throttling of social media ahead of the elections; subsequently, Twitter blocked some posts inside Turkey.  There was also the worry that pro-government media may skew information in favor of the AKP. According to the journalist Amberin Zaman, writing in Al-Monitor, “In April, Erdogan got 32 hours of air time on state TV compared with 32 minutes for Kilicdaroglu.” As the election results began to come in, some expressed fears that the state-run Anadolu agency may preemptively announce an Erdoğan victory before all the results were counted. In the end, both sides claimed to be ahead, with Erdoğan telling his supporters, “Although the final results are not in yet, we are leading by far,” according to the New York Times.  What has the opposition, led by Kılıçdaroğlu, said about press freedom in the country, if anything? And how credible has that sounded?  Kılıçdaroğlu has promised a return to “democracy” and many journalists expressed hope that this would mean that press freedom would again be possible. Many media watchers seem cautiously hopeful that a Kılıçdaroğlu victory would also be the way to open the door to an independent press. “We still would have a press freedom problem if the opposition takes power,” said Kenan Şener, general secretary of the Ankara-based Journalists’ Association, in an interview with the Committee to Protect Journalists. “However, I believe it’s certain that we will be in a better spot than this.”  On the other hand, when Kılıçdaroğlu’s opposition party, the CHP, was in power in the nineties it had a checkered record when it came to freedom of the press. It was known for also jailing journalists that opposed it, although not to the same extent as Erdoğan.  How do you see the Turkish media landscape changing as a result of this election, as it now heads to a runoff?  It truly depends on the results. If the opposition wins then I anticipate that we will see an initial gleeful rush of media freedom as journalists stretch their wings for the first time in years. But it’s unclear how long that would last—as I said, the CHP does not have the best record when it comes to journalists— though it seems unlikely that the crackdown on the press would remain as stringent as it has been under Erdoğan. I am hopeful that journalists who have long been in jail on trumped-up charges might finally be released.  If Erdoğan wins, things will undoubtedly get worse. If nothing else, the closeness of this election shows that the AKP’s grip on power is fraying. That insecurity may cause it to take an even more draconian grip on power. As Barış Altıntaş, the director of Istanbul’s Media and Law Studies Association, said in the same CPJ interview: “If they [the AKP] win by a slim margin, they might lose some of their perceived legitimacy, feel cornered, and become more repressive towards free speech and media freedoms.”    Other notable stories:  ICYMI: What a national-security regulator could mean for media deals  Jon Allsop is a freelance journalist whose work has appeared in the New York Review of Books, Foreign Policy, and The Nation, among other outlets.

One of the biggest questions that have been pestering fans is what happened in Reverie while Luffy and company had their hands full in Wano. With Sabo having a meeting with Monkey D. Dragon and Ivankov, the truth behind Cobra's demise is seemingly preparing to be revealed.  Warning. If you have yet to read the latest chapter of One Piece's manga, Chapter 1083, you might want to steer clear as we'll be diving into some serious spoiler territory. There have been many rumors swirling as to what took place on Reverie for the past few years in our world, as mysteries have been surrounding how Cobra died and what role Sabo had in the assassination. In the Grand Line, most swashbucklers and denizens believe that Luffy's brother was the one responsible for the benevolent ruler's demise, but it would seem that this might not be the case as Sabo has been hinting otherwise.  (Photo: Shueisha)  What Happened To Cobra?  To begin, Monkey D. Dragon seems to hint that the general public's thoughts on the event aren't exactly the truth, ""Regardless of the truth behind it, the assassination of King Cobra has turned you into a hero in the people's eyes. From the perspective of the rebellious, anyone affiliated with the world government is an enemy. Of course, there are many wicked kings who oppress their people but there are also wise and just kings who are capable rulers. King Cobra of Alabasta was known far and wide as a noble leader, a man of great character, but new does not always spread accurately.""  Sabo then added to this thought, putting gas on the fire as to the truth behind Cobra's murder, ""Well I'm sorry to King Cobra, but this way suits me just fine. Anything that gets the flames of revolution burning."" The chapter itself then proceeds to take us back to the Reverie event, as readers are able to witness Cobra being moved to the Five Elders in a wheelchair. While the truth has yet to be revealed, it certainly seems as though Sabo wasn't the one who delivered the killing blow to Cobra.  How do you think King Cobra died? Do you see Sabo and his revolutionaries playing a major role in this final arc?

The decision comes after a very public campaign for the candidacy by Terry Guo, the billionaire founder and chairman of the Foxconn electronics manufacturing group. The KMT declined to hold a vote of its membership and instead party chairman Chu Li-lun chose the party’s candidate directly.  Hou You-yi is mayor of New Taipei City (known as Taipei County until it was upgraded to city status in 2010). Before that, Hou had a long and storied career as a police officer, rising to head Taiwan’s Criminal Investigation Bureau in 2003.  He was involved in the attempt to arrest democracy activist Deng Nan-jung in 1989 at the offices of the dissident magazine Freedom Era Weekly, and several months later Deng self-immolated to protest authoritarianism in Taiwan. Hou was also placed in command of the investigation into the attempted assassination of former president Chen Shui-bian during the 2004 presidential election.  Hou’s rival is Lai Ching-te from the incumbent Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). Lai is currently vice president of Taiwan and unsuccessfully challenged President Tsai Ing-wen in a DPP presidential primary in 2019. Tsai went on to score a crushing win against the KMT in the 2020 election. However, Tsai can’t run for a third term, and Lai faced no challengers in the DPP for 2024.  Lai has a background in public health and a master’s from Harvard University. He began his political career as a legislator in the 1990s before serving as a very popular mayor of Tainan, a DPP stronghold, in the 2010s. He joined the Tsai government as premier in 2017.  The third candidate in the election is the former mayor of Taipei, Ko Wen-je. Ko has a celebrated medical background in critical and emergency care and transplant surgery. He was first elected mayor in 2014, against the KMT and other independents, and re-elected in 2018.  In 2019, Ko founded his own political party, the Taiwan People’s Party (TPP), which shares its name but not its politics with the party founded in 1927 by Chiang Wei-shui, Cai Pei-huo and other leading figures of the time. In a very divisive political landscape, the TPP aims to occupy the centre ground with an emphasis on non-partisan governance, but Ko is also known for his public gaffes and political naivety.  Polling has Hou and Lai in a close race with around 30% support each, with Lai generally a few points ahead. Ko sits in third at around 20%. These numbers are hardly predictive this far out from the vote in January, but with each party having chosen its candidate, onlookers can expect a very different presidential campaign and a shift in tone in Taiwan’s politics.  As the DPP candidate, Lai has emphasised continuity with Tsai, but he is still a very different style of politician. Tsai casts herself as disciplined, resolute and technocratic, even somewhat above the fray. Lai, although he couldn’t be called a populist, has built a more hands-on career through local politics in the south.  The KMT’s Hou offers his no-nonsense and pragmatic style to a party that wrestles with its authoritarian legacy and its close links with Taiwan’s business interests. Although Hou and Lai are stridently critical of each other, they occupy some of the same space as political personas.  Ko, for his part, will take votes away from both major parties but may prove more damaging for the KMT in its traditional stronghold of Taipei.  As candidates, both Hou and Lai have given voice to issues in Taiwanese politics that are too often subsumed by cross-strait relations, especially the north–south divide and gender and class politics. But neither candidate has a straightforward story to tell on those issues yet, and that could make for a bruising campaign.  Across the strait, Beijing would be deeply unhappy with Lai as president, seeing him as more explicitly Taiwanese nationalist than Tsai, however careful he might be in the campaign. Hou has stayed in line with the KMT’s position. He has already ruled out Beijing’s formula of ‘one country, two systems’ for unification and doesn’t represent the factions of the KMT for whom Chinese identity is central to their politics.  Whether it be Lai Ching-te or Hou You-yi, understanding the next president of Taiwan will require some work from an international community that has grown comfortable with and sympathetic to Tsai. Her progressive politics are accessible and familiar to interested international observers.  Hou and Lai, however, practise a politics steeped in community life and the social divides of Taiwan. While they are each compelling, the world will require deeper familiarity with the Taiwanese story to fully understand them as politicians.  As Beijing continues its threatening military activity around Taiwan, developing that familiarity will be a good starting point for policymakers around the world as they prepare for the 2024 election outcome."

This is especially true if you are a soldier or a civilian who gets in the way – but it is not true for everyone.  Not for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, at least not this time.  When Palestinian Islamic Jihad began firing rockets to avenge the May 2 death of one of their own, resulting from his 86-day hunger strike, Netanyahu’s ultra-hawkish coalition partners demanded a brutal response. They would have preferred carpet bombing Gaza with B-52s but appeared to be mollified by a highly focused assassination campaign that killed six top PIJ leaders.  The risk-averse Israeli prime minister went to war with PIJ and emerged victorious on all fronts. He got to burnish his “Mr. Security” credentials without a major land war and – at least for the time being – saved his coalition and stopped the plunge in his polling numbers.  By firing more than 1,400 rockets and mortars across the southern half of Israel – even targeting Tel Aviv – PIJ gave Netanyahu a temporary respite from the massive public demonstrations against his attempted overthrow of the nation’s independent judiciary. Only tens of thousands of protesters, instead of the usual hundreds of thousands, turned out last weekend.  The Iron Dome air defense missile systems is seen during operational trials conducted following the conclusion Operation Shield and Arrow on May 14, 2023 (credit: DEFENSE MINISTRY)  This latest conflict may also have dealt a body blow to the Israeli far Right’s judicial coup. Former senior Mossad official Yossi Alpha pointed out that “the fight against PIJ was led by the very IAF pilots and IDF Unit 8200 cyber experts who have spearheaded the public protest and been labeled by the far Right as ‘traitors.’”  “The fight against PIJ was led by the very IAF pilots and IDF Unit 8200 cyber experts who have spearheaded the public protest and been labeled by the far Right as ‘traitors.’” Yossi Alpha  With the international media focused on the spectacular footage of Israel’s anti-missile systems intercepting rockets fired from Gaza, Finland expressed an interest in these defensive weapons.  Finland joins Singapore, Canada, South Korea, India, Slovakia and the Czech Republic in wishing to acquire the life-saving Iron Dome and David’s Sling. Israel’s new friends in the Gulf are also interested, as they face threats from Iran.  The US helped finance their development, and US defense contractor Raytheon partnered with the Israeli developer, Rafael, to build the systems.  War is good for business and for Netanyahu  War is good for business. Just look at the defense plants across the US and Western Europe working overtime to keep the Russian bear from restoring its old empire.  There is, however, a country that wants and needs Israel’s advanced missile defense, but is off limits – Ukraine – because Bibi doesn’t want to anger Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. Nevertheless, Israel and Ukraine have a common enemy, Iran, which provides most of PIJ’s missiles aimed at Israel, and Russia’s drones targeting Ukraine.  The IDF reported that Iron Dome intercepted 95% of PIJ rockets targeting populated areas. Hundreds more landed in open fields. An estimated 290 PIJ rockets launched toward Israel landed in Gaza, killing at least four Palestinians, including children.  PIJ rockets killed an 82-year-old Jewish Israeli woman in Rehovot and wounded five people. Another PIJ rocket killed a Palestinian man from Gaza working legally in Israel on Moshav Shokeda, while his brother and a Bedouin Israeli were wounded in the strike, i24 News reported.  Many of Israel’s critics point to the disproportionate casualty rate on the two sides. Not enough dead Jews, apparently. Health officials in Gaza said 33 people were killed in the latest round, including 18 terrorists and six children. At least four uninvolved Gazans were killed in failed rocket launches, Times of Israel reported.  PIJ, it turns out, killed more Gaza civilians than it did Israelis, and it wasn’t for lack of trying. PIJ, like Hamas, fires its rockets, missiles and mortars indiscriminately toward populated areas in Israel for the undeniable purpose of creating terror and death. PIJ and Hamas are both US State Department-designated Foreign Terror Organizations and the EU terror organizations list. Hamas dominates Gaza but decided to sit out this round of fighting.  The Israeli Air Force insists its aim is precise and targeted only terrorists, to avoid civilian casualties – but terrorist leadership headquarters and many launch sites are intentionally located in populated urban areas.  There’s a brief respite in the latest round of war – thanks once again to an Egyptian-negotiated ceasefire – while Iran rearms its proxies (and arms Russia as well). PIJ brags about the damage it inflicted on Israel, and vows new revenge for the six martyred leaders lost to the hated Zionists. Meanwhile, Rafael and Raytheon are taking orders for Iron Domes and David’s Slings. And Netanyahu has appeased his uber-hawks.  And just as sure as God made little green apples, there will be another round of killing because the leaders on both sides seem to know of no other way to settle their differences.  If there is one thing today’s Israeli and Palestinian leaders appear to have in common, it is a lack of interest in finding a political solution.  There will be more Shield and Arrow-type operations, each a bit longer and more lethal until there is new leadership that does not see peaceful coexistence as an existential threat.  Until then, you can dust off that old Vietnam-era poster with the slogan, “War is not healthy for children and other living things” and add: “except for politicians’ poll numbers and arms makers’ order books.”  The writer is a Washington-based journalist, consultant and lobbyist, and the former American Israel Public Affairs Committee legislative director."

The French company didn't achieve good results last year with some of its releases. Titles like Skull and Bones are taking longer than expected while others like Beyond Good and Evil 2 have completely disappeared from the radar. In such a scenario, Ubisoft is betting on one of its most popular series to save 2024. We are talking about Assassin's Creed, of course.  After the success of Assassin's Creed Valhalla, the developer seems to be taking a slightly different direction with Assassin's Creed: Mirage. The upcoming game will offer a smaller and more intimate experience, more character-driven, and much closer to the first installments in the series.  The new game will be a return to the origins of the series with a story set in Baghdad during the height of the Persian Empire. It will star Basim, a young street thief seeking justice who enters a secret organization that will change his life and the story forever. Ubisoft aims to deliver gameplay more focused on stealth and assassination with Assassin's Creed Mirage, which is something that the fans of the series have been requesting for a while.  More resources for the series  Ubisoft has recently revealed plans to expand the team working on Assassin's Creed by 40% in the coming years, raising their numbers from 2.000 to 2.800, which shows its commitment to the series. Assassin's Creed Mirage will be the first game to benefit from such an improvement. Meanwhile, there are reports pointing at an October release for the game, but nothing has been officially confirmed so far.

Information obtained by Iran International shows how Naji Sharifi-Zindashti and his cartel now dominate the narcotics trade thanks to the support of the government militia.  His extraordinary rise comes despite his having killed a prison guard in Iran and fleeing abroad, only to return with impunity.  Investigative reporter Mojtaba Pourmohsen has uncovered how a recent rise in the number of executions of convicts sentenced to death on drug-related charges is the result of infighting between rival drug cartels with connections within the ranks of the IRGC.  Naji Sharifi-Zindashti  Emerging triumphant from this criminal war, Sharifi-Zindashti and his accomplices – dubbed “The Friends’ Club” – have used the IRGC’s vast reach and control over transit routes and logistics to gain the upper hand in Iran's drug market, according to sources.  The Club comprises senior IRGC officials and high-ranking members of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council as well as managers from Tehran Municipality and members of parliament.  Sharifi-Zindashti not only pays bribes but also supplies opium and heroin for the personal consumption of many of these senior officials.  According to the sources, Sharifi-Zindashti’s gangs traffic more than 20 percent of drugs distributed across Iran and about 35 percent of the drugs pushed in the capital Tehran.  The narcotics that are confiscated and destroyed as part of the Islamic Republic’s regular war on drugs mostly belong to rival gangs.  Iranian police arrested Zindashti in 1996 for a drug deal. Sentenced to death on drug-related charges, Zindashti along with an accomplice killed a guard during transfer to the court to testify in another case. Zindashti fled to Turkey, where he established a drug and human trafficking cartel.  Zindashti's villa in Istanbul with expensive cars and personalized license plates  He has since been cooperating with the Islamic Republic’s intelligence agencies in numerous cases, including the abduction in 2020 of Swedish-Iranian Habib Chaab (Asyud), a political activist and former leader of the Arab Struggle Movement for the Liberation of Ahwaz (ASMLA) who was executed earlier in the month.  In December 2020, the Turkish Police arrested 13 members of the Zindashti Cartel on charges of collaboration with Iranian intelligence. According to Turkey's official government news agency, Anatoli, the Iranian Intelligence Ministry had been using the gang to assassinate or abduct Iranian dissidents in Turkey at least since 2015.  Zindashti is also suspected to have been behind the assassination of Iranian dissident Masoud Molavi Vardanjani in Istanbul in November 2019. Molavi-Vardanjani, a former Iranian intelligence operative and a civil engineer by education, fled to Turkey in 2018 and launched a Telegram channel, called Black Box, focused on corruption allegations against Iran’s extraterritorial Qods Force, top officials in the office of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, judges and other senior figures.  In 2018 some of the members of the group and Zindashti himself were arrested in Turkey on suspicion of assassinating Saeed Karimian, the founder and head of Gem TV, and other killings related to drug trafficking. They were eventually freed, reportedly as a result of lobbying, bribery and lack of adequate evidence.  After his release Zindashti returned to Iran and despite his convictions for drug trafficking and the killing of a prison guard in the past, Zindashti leads a free life in Iran. In December 2022, he was honored during a ceremony by Iran’s Education Ministry as one of the members of the Charity for School Constructions. He is a benefactor and CEO of Zindashti Star Charitable Institute, constructing shopping malls and schools, yet also a drug lord with links to regime insiders."

He’s done with one. But not the other.  “The franchise is not done. I’m done,” Schwarzenegger tells THR when speaking about the long-running Terminator franchise that he recently returned to for 2019’s Dark Fate.  The actor continues, “I got the message loud and clear that the world wants to move on with a different theme when it comes to The Terminator. Someone has to come up with a great idea. The Terminator was largely responsible for my success, so I always would look at it very fondly. The first three movies were great. Number four [Salvation] I was not in because I was governor. Then five [Genisys] and six [Dark Fate] didn’t close the deal as far as I’m concerned. We knew that ahead of time because they were just not well written.”  In regards to Conan, Schwarzenegger is a whole lot more hopeful.  He tells THR, “It’s been pending for the last 10 years. [Fredrik] Malmberg owns the rights. He comes to me and says, ‘Oh, I have a deal with Netflix,’ and when we ask Netflix, they don’t know anything about it. It’s one of those crazy things. I hope he figures it out.  “I think you do it like Unforgiven, where you play the age. There’s a great script out there that John Milius wrote, and others have written one. The story is there. There are directors who want to do it. But [Malmberg] has the rights, and until he sells the rights for one or two movies, or for the franchise, there’s nothing you can do about it.”  Schwarzenegger of course played Conan in the 1980s feature films Conan the Barbarian and Conan the Destroyer, and he has been vocal about trying to get a new Conan movie off the ground for a while now. At one point in time, The Legend of Conan was intended to be a direct sequel to the 1982 movie, with Schwarzenegger returning as an older Conan.  Will it ever happen? Stay tuned for more as we hear it."

Haitians are “taking the law into their own hands” with a wave of vigilantism that risks worsening the country’s already skyrocketing levels of violence, a United Nations official has warned.  Ravina Shamdasani, a spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said that suspected Haitian gang members have been killed and lynched in the streets amid the recent rise of “vigilante justice”.  “We’re seeing a cycle of violence that’s showing no sign of ending,” Shamdasani said in an interview with Al Jazeera this week. “It’s incredibly worrying.”  “People are living in a nightmarish scenario and there’s very little hope, so they’re taking the law into their own hands, which of course is not going to help long term.”  Shamdasani added that nearly 1,500 gang-related killings were reported between January 1 and the end of April, with 49 more taking place between May 10 and 15 alone. “This is a situation that’s akin to an armed conflict situation,” she said.      Widespread gang violence has plagued Haiti for nearly two years, as armed groups vie for control after the July 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moise, which created a power vacuum.  Haiti’s de facto leader, Prime Minister Ariel Henry, whom Moise chose for the post just days before he was killed, has faced a crisis of legitimacy — and attempts to chart a political transition for Haiti have failed as well.  The violence has impeded access to healthcare facilities, forced the closure of schools and clinics, and worsened already dire food insecurity by cutting residents of gang-controlled areas off from critical supplies.  The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) warned this month that more than 115,600 Haitian children in 2023 were expected to suffer from “severe acute malnutrition”, also known as “severe wasting”, as a result of the instability.  Police under-equipped  The Haitian National Police have pledged to combat the gangs, saying in a statement posted to Facebook on Tuesday that the force “does not intend to give up and renews its pledge to continue to protect lives and property of the population”.  But observers have said the Haitian police are ill-equipped and understaffed and cannot adequately respond to the crisis.  “The Haitian police is not managing the situation well,” the UN’s Shamdasani said. “They cannot manage this on their own, and the people realise this, which is why they’re taking the law into their own hands.”  In recent weeks, a vigilante movement called Bwa Kale — “peeled wood” in Haitian Creole — has emerged, with Haitians arming themselves with sticks, machetes and other weapons to go after the gangs.  In late April, residents in the capital Port-au-Prince lynched suspected gang members and set their bodies on fire. Images shared online and by news agencies showed a crowd of people standing near a pile of burned human remains in a street.  The Bwa Kale movement is “a vaccination campaign against gang violence”, Jean Baptist Kenley, a social leader in the Port-au-Prince area of Solino, recently told Al Jazeera. “The Bwa Kale will continue to eradicate the kidnapping violence in the country.”  ‘Short-term solution’  Garry Pierre-Pierre, a Haitian-American journalist and founder of The Haitian Times, recently told NPR that the Haitian population has also “enlisted the police” to help in efforts to stop gang violence.  In some cases, Pierre-Pierre explained, community members will identify gang members and take law enforcement officers directly to them to make arrests.  “It’s not totally the population taking things into their own hands,” Pierre-Pierre said. “It’s not totally like vigilante[s]. It’s working hand-in-glove with the police … to give the police now the upper hand as they fight these gangs.”  Vigilantism “is not the answer” to Haiti’s problems, Pierre-Pierre also wrote recently.  “It is a short-term solution the police must take a hold of immediately, to seize the advantage it affords to rid Port-au-Prince of this menace that has brought the capital city, and by extension the country, to its knees over the last two years,” he said.  “The police can continue their operations alongside the people to credibly identify alleged gang members. These suspects should be treated as innocent until proven guilty, facing the fullest extent of the law — as feeble as Haiti’s justice system may be right now.”  Meanwhile, the UN continues to urge the international community to launch a multilateral mission to help Haiti respond to the violence.  UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who discussed the situation in Haiti during a meeting with Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness in Kingston this week, said the crisis requires “a much stronger commitment by the international community”.

Instead, they have urged foreign nations to provide more support to the Haitian police, stem the flow of weapons to Haiti — particularly those coming from the United States — and sanction officials and others profiting off the violence."

To subscribe, click here.  I'm RFE/RL correspondent Golnaz Esfandiari. Here's what I've been following during the past week and what I'm watching for in the days ahead.  The Big Issue  Dozens of independent Iranian lawyers were imprisoned during the monthslong antiestablishment protests that erupted last September. Most had represented jailed protesters or been critical of the authorities on social media.  Many of the lawyers were later freed under an amnesty announced by Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in February.  But in recent days, around 20 lawyers across the country have been summoned. It was not clear if they were facing new charges or had been called in for questioning.  ""The amnesty gave me hope but these actions that are taking place are frustrating,"" lawyer Ali Mojtahedzadeh said on Twitter on May 11, adding that he did not know why he had been summoned.  ""The lawyers who have been summoned are lawyers who were [defending protesters] or those who have been active on social media,"" said Mojtahedzadeh.  Mitra Izadifard, a lawyer from the northeastern city of Mashhad, told the reformist daily Etemad that she and several other lawyers had been called in to appear before a court in Tehran on May 22. Izadifard said she was summoned due to some of her ""tweets and previous legal activities.""  Why It Matters: The authorities appear to be renewing pressure on independent lawyers who have taken on sensitive political cases or criticized the clerical establishment.  Independent lawyers have been under systematic pressure and harassment for decades in the Islamic republic. Many have been forced into exile or ended up in jail, including prominent human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh.  What's Next: It is unclear if the authorities are trying to intimidate or imprison again those lawyers who have continued to criticize the clerical regime since their release.  Since the antiestablishment protests subsided, lawyers have been vocal in their criticism of the authorities, including their new attempts to enforce the hijab law.  Several lawyers, including Mohsen Borhani, have said publicly that the measures are a violation of the Islamic republic's laws.  Stories You Might Have Missed  Nearly eight months ago, 21-year-old Erfan Rezai was killed during Iran's brutal crackdown on protests. Despite threats and pressure, his mother has waged a social media campaign to demand justice. In an interview, Farzaneh Barzekar said she holds little hope that real justice will be served.  Afghan migrants in Iran are finding it difficult to carry out the most routine transactions because they cannot obtain the bank cards they need to access mobile phone services, metro tickets, and even their daily bread. They say the restrictions, which affect long-term immigrants and undocumented arrivals alike, are making life increasingly difficult.  What We're Watching  Azerbaijan said on May 16 that it arrested at least seven men who were allegedly recruited by Iran to destabilize the Caucasus nation.  In a statement, Baku said the men were plotting a ""violent overthrow of the government and the assassinations of prominent personalities and senior officials.""  The arrests were the latest in a series of detentions of people the Azerbaijani government says were working for Iran.  Why It Matters: Relations between the two neighbors have become increasingly strained in recent months, particularly since an attack on the Azerbaijani Embassy in Tehran.  In January, a lone gunman stormed the embassy, killing one person. Azerbaijan blamed Tehran for the incident, which it described as a terrorist attack. The Iranian Foreign Ministry said the gunman had personal motives.  Tensions were further heightened in March following a failed assassination attempt in Baku on a parliamentarian in Azerbaijan who has been critical of Iran.  Last month, Azerbaijan expelled four Iranian diplomats in Baku. In response, Iran expelled the Azerbaijani ambassador in Tehran.  Baku has accused Iran of backing Armenia in a long-standing conflict over Azerbaijan's breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh region. Iran has long blamed Azerbaijan for fueling separatist sentiments among its sizeable ethnic Azeri minority. Tehran has also been critical of Baku's deepening relations with Israel, Iran's archenemy.

The citation for the award reads: “A brave and uncompromising pulse-taking of the current crisis in Indian politics, focusing on the 2017 political assassination of trailblazing Bengaluru journalist Gauri Lankesh. A “J’accuse” docu-thriller directed and narrated with verve by Gauri’s sister, Kavitha Lankesh”.  Second international award for my documentary on my beloved sister “Gauri”https://t.co/kaQCk0qwW5 — KavithaLankesh (@kavithalankesh) May 16, 2023  According to The Hindu, another Indian documentary film, All That Breathes, was the runner-up.  Last year, Gauri won the “Best Human Rights Film” award at the Toronto Women’s Film Festival.  In a March 2022 interview with The Federal, Lankesh spoke about why she decided to make the film. “To make a film on Gauri is a really tough decision because she was more than a sister to me. She was my friend, mentor, conscience keeper. I am still struggling to come to terms with her exit from this mortal world.”  “But I decided to do the film just because she is a model to thousands of women and journalists in this country … The world knew more about her only after her assassination,” the poet-filmmaker said.  Gauri Lankesh was shot dead at her Bengaluru residence in 2017 by a man who said he was following orders to kill Lankesh with the purpose of “saving his religion“. At the time of her death, Lankesh’s weekly magazine had come under attack for her views against the communal politics of the Sangh parivar in Karnataka.  The film was commissioned by the Netherlands-based press freedom organisation Free Press Unlimited, which says on its website that its mission is to support “local media professionals and journalists, particularly in countries with limited (press) freedom” and enable them to give people access to information through which “they can monitor their governments.”"

In court papers filed Wednesday, Justice Department lawyers claimed the Massachusetts Air National Guardsman jotted down top-secret information during confidential meetings that he would then spread across a social media channel dedicated to video games and guns.  “It is clear that the dissemination of the classified national defense information that the Defendant unlawfully posted was even more widespread and diverse than previously known,” the documents state.  “It is also clear that the Defendant publicly exalted in the breadth and sensitivity of the information that he was disclosing … The Defendant boasted about the wide swath of classified information he had access to by virtue of his position.”  Teixeira, who worked as a cyber transport systems specialist, was arrested last month and charged under the Espionage Act with unauthorized retention and transmission of classified national defense information for allegedly sharing hundreds of highly classified Pentagon documents concerning national security and the war in Ukraine on the gaming platform Discord over the course of several months.  According to the Wednesday filing, one of the social media platforms servers had at least 150 users — including overseas individuals — at the time Teixeira allegedly shared confidential information, though prosecutors believe “many more” users have since flocked to the channel since his arrest.  Jack Teixeira was allegedly warned twice to stop taking notes on top-secret information. via REUTERS  In one chat, the 21-year-old told his friends that he would post “a f–ck ton of information” about US intelligence in Israel, Palestine, Syria, Iran, China and more, the filing shows.  “Idgaf what they say I can or can’t share … [a]ll of the s–t I’ve told you guys I’m not supposed to,” he allegedly told other users, implying he understood the unlawfulness of his disclosures.  Teixeira was admonished by his superiors in September 2022 for reportedly scribbling down notes during a confidential meeting and slipping the piece of paper into his pocket.  Teixeira is charged with unauthorized retention and transmission of classified national defense information. AP  He was given a cease-and-desist order preventing him from conducting “any deep dives into classified  intelligence information,” but Teixeira was caught taking notes a second time just one month later.  In February 2023, Teixeira was again observed “viewing content that was not related to his duties,” prosecutors said.  The federal filing also claimed that Teixeira’s secret history as a potentially violent person proves that he was acting maliciously when he allegedly shared secret information on Discord.  Teixeira was arrested April 13 by heavily armed federal agents clad in armor at his mother’s home in North Dighton, Mass. New York Post  Prosecutors pointed to a video published by the Washington Post of Teixeira using racial and ethnic slurs while “emptying the magazine of bullets” at a target.  He also allegedly said online that he wanted to murder a “ton of people” in the name of “culling the weak-minded” and talked about rigging an “assassination van.”  “There is every indication that the Defendant is skilled and experienced at hiding these unsavory aspects of his character,” the filing states.  Teixeira, who has not yet entered a plea, claimed he never intended for any of the information he shared to be “widely disseminated.”  A ruling on Teixeira’s pre-trial detention is expected Friday."

Eighty-eight-year-old Nebraskan Beverly Deepe Keever knows that war better than most Americans. She was America’s longest-serving Vietnam War correspondent.  Born in Hebron, Nebraska, Beverly Deepe Keever earned her journalism degree from University of Nebraska and a master’s from New York’s Columbia University. At age 26, she bought a one-way ticket to Asia to teach English and sell freelance stories to the Associated Press.  “I went into journalism because I wanted to understand people and culture in other countries,” Deepe Keever said.  Author, journalist and scholar Brooke Kroeger said Deepe Keever had something special as a reporter.  ""This is someone who's got a halo, you know,” he said. “There's something really marvelous about her in her sense of herself, even coming from a small Nebraska town.”  A year after arriving in Asia, Deepe Keever came to Saigon as fighting began heating up between South Vietnamese troops and Viet Cong guerrillas backed by Communist North Vietnam. The U.S. government sent 500 military advisors to help South Vietnam, and more U.S. troops began pouring in. In 1962, Deepe Keever sent a letter to her friend in Nebraska describing her experience.  “I am undergoing a shock treatment here,” she wrote. “All those professional and personal ideals which had never been shattered until I reached here seem to be under constant bombardment. The things that happen in the country would be a bombshell to the American public.”  Friends and family read Deepe Keever’s newspaper reports about all the fighting in Vietnam from 8,600 miles away.  “Paul would call up Dad,” she said. “’Get that girl out of there. Get that girl out of there.’ And Dad said, ‘We don’t even know how to contact her.’”"

From playing a woman, a dwarf, and an elderly man to ten roles in one film, he has done it all. Apart from his different avatars in films, Kamal Haasan is also known to make movies on social issues that are often deemed sensitive. This has caused trouble for many of his films, with calls for a ban on them. Here, we are listing some of Kamal Haasan’s most controversial films that created a lot of buzz.  Vishwaroopam  Vishwaroopam was dogged by numerous controversies. Due to concerns over communal violence, the movie was banned in Tamil Nadu. The film, according to the Tamil Nadu Muslim Munnetra Kazhagam, indicated that all Muslims were terrorists. Later, the High Court removed the ban. Tamil Nadu theatre owners challenged Kamal Haasan’s decision to show the movie via satellite. A week after its first theatrical run, the movie was made available via DTH.  Dasavatharam  This movie was famous for Kamal Haasan enacting 10 different roles, something never attempted before in Indian cinema. However, during the early portion of the film which was set during the Chola empire, certain scenes depicted the clash and hostility between followers of Vaishnavism and Shaivism, which resulted in protests. In the meantime, assistant director Senthil Kumar claimed that his script was used as inspiration for the movie’s narrative. The film was temporarily banned when the matter was heard by the Madras High Court. But the court ultimately decided to dismiss the lawsuit.  Vasool Raja MBBS  This movie was a remake of the highly successful Hindi film Munnabhai MBBS. The title of the movie was alleged to denigrate doctors by the Indian Medical Association of Erode. The makers of the film later assured that the film was not critical of doctors.  Thevar Magan  This movie was believed to have targeted the Mukkulalthor or Thevar community and protests were held against the film when it released  top videos  Hey Ram  Probably, one of Kamal Haasan’s most controversial but critically acclaimed films, the movie explored everything from Hindu-Muslim riots to the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi."

A joint statement issued by the Ministry of Interior, the State Security Service, and the Prosecutor General's Office on May 16 revealed that the suspects ""were working for Iranian secret services.""  They are accused of seeking to ""disrupt stability"" in the South Caucasus country by disseminating ""religious propaganda.""  The statement said that Ruhollah Akhundzadeh and his son Al-Morsel Akhundzadeh, in collaboration with the Iranian special services, plotted ""to forcefully change the constitutional structure of the Republic of Azerbaijan and orchestrate armed rebellions with the objective to establish the ""Karima"" state, and to organize assassination attempts on prominent personalities and senior officials,"" the statement reads.  The two men formed clandestine groups on WhatsApp, Telegram and other instant messaging systems, and provided members of the group with a list of government officials and prominent figures, along with their residential and workplace addresses, in order to organize their assassinations.  Azerbaijani media reported that Akhundzadeh intended to send members of the group to Iran, under the guise of religious education, to receive military training.  Last month, Azerbaijani news agencies reported the alleged arrest of the leaders of a group called ""Hosseiniun"" in the Iranian city of Qom.  Tohid Ebrahim Beigli and Orkhan Mamedov are accused by Azerbaijani authorities of planning to establish the ""Karima"" state in Azerbaijan.  In late 2015, Ebrahim Beigli formed the ""Hosseiniun Brigade"" (Hosseinchiler) with 14 Azerbaijani students who were studying in Qom and Mashhad.  The aim of the group was to fight against the ISIS extremist group in Syria and prepare for an armed conflict in Azerbaijan.  In late 2015, Ebrahim Beigli, along with 14 students from the Republic of Azerbaijan who were studying in Qom and Mashhad, formed the ""Hosseiniun Brigade,"" with the stated objective of fighting against the ISIS extremist group in Syria and prepare for an armed conflict in Azerbaijan.  Who is Ruhollah Akhundzadeh?  Ruhollah Akhundzadeh, the deputy of the Islamic Party of Azerbaijan, was sentenced to 11 years in prison in 2011. Following his release, he traveled to Iran in 2020 where he has been actively involved in organizing religious extremist groups closely associated with the Islamic Republic.  The State Security Service of Azerbaijan issued a statement in November last year saying it had conducted an operation against an illegal armed group which operated under the guidance of the Iranian intelligence services. Akhundzadeh was apprehended during the operation.  In the past year alone, Akhundzadeh, with the support of the intelligence agencies of the Islamic Republic, has reportedly made two attempts to establish an armed group aimed at carrying out acts of sabotage and terrorism in Azerbaijan.  According to the newspaper Mosavat, the intelligence agencies of the Islamic Republic are secretly promoting religious extremist ideas in Azerbaijan to encourage citizens to participate in military exercises abroad and finance their activities.  Lasting Tensions Between the Two Neighbors  Baku and Tehran have often had strained relations, with Azerbaijan accusing the Islamic Republic of trying to destabilize the country. Azerbaijan also criticizes Iran for allegedly backing Armenia in the long-standing conflict over Azerbaijan's breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh region.  According to the Baku Post, Iranian intelligence agencies attempted to use Azerbaijani citizens to act against Azerbaijan's interests and in favor of Armenia during the 44-day war between the two countries over Nagorno-Karabakh in 2020.  In turn, Tehran has long accused Baku of fueling separatist sentiments among its sizeable ethnic Azeri minority. The Islamic Republic also fears that Azerbaijani territory could be used for a possible attack against Iran by Israel.  The Azerbaijani authorities strongly reacted to military maneuvers conducted by the Islamic Republic along the Azerbaijan border, calling them provocative and unacceptable.  Tensions between the two neighbors escalated over the past months following a ""terrorist attack"" on the Azerbaijani Embassy in Tehran, the arrest of individuals affiliated with Iranian intelligence services on charges of espionage, the assassination attempt on a member of an Azerbaijani lawmaker, the expulsion of diplomats from both nations, and the opening of an Azerbaijani embassy in Israel.  ""Iran Seeks to Regain Influence"" in the South Caucasus  ""Over the past 30 years, Iran has consistently sought to interfere in Azerbaijan's internal affairs,"" university professor and political analyst Nazem Jafar Soy tells IranWire.  ""This has included sending mullahs to Azerbaijan, influencing the youth of the country through religious teachings in Iran, engaging in espionage, and exploiting the religious sentiments of the Azerbaijani people,"" he added.  But Jafar Soy says that Iran's ""once relatively prominent role in the Caucasus region has diminished"" since the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War, with Turkey taking its place.  ""As a result, Iran seeks to regain influence in the region by using threats and creating espionage groups to portray the area as unsafe and reclaim its position in the Caucasus,"" he adds."

If involved, they should be brought to justice as soon as possible. As the saying goes ‘blood leaves its trail,’” AAC general secretary Ghulam Nabi Zaki said.  The statement came a day after the J&K Police’s special wing, State Investigation Agency (SIA), claimed to have arrested two militants, Javaid Bhat and Zahoor Ahmed Bhat, who were involved in the assassination.  The police said Hizbul Mujahideen commander Abdullah Bangroo had hatched the conspiracy to kill the ex-Mirwaiz.  The AAC has described the killing as “a very painful and tragic part of our lives as well as in the history of Kashmir”. “A visionary leader, who espoused dialogue, tolerance and people’s will as his ideology. The message was carried forward by his son Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, who took over under tragic circumstances,” the AAC spokesman said.  He said the assassinated leader “was a great Islamic preacher, a social reformer and an excellent human being”. His brutal assassination is unpardonable.

The increased security comes in the wake of an attack on Prime Minister Fumio Kishida last month and the assassination of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in 2022.  Patrolling police have been visible in the city’s Peace Park, while security personnel are monitoring the river alongside the Atomic Bomb Dome. Helicopters have also been conducting regular patrols overhead. The heightened security measures have extended to other areas, including Tokyo, with messages on the train system warning of increased security for the summit.  Public areas in major cities across Japan have seen rubbish bins sealed off, coin lockers at train stations put out of operation, and vending machines on subway platforms unplugged and taped off. In Hiroshima, signs throughout the city and hotels inform residents and tourists of the summit-related disruptions, including street closures and restricted access to the island of Miyajima, reported Channel News Asia.  Follow us on :              Several schools and institutions have chosen to close during the summit, as reported by local media. The security measures are under close scrutiny, particularly after the assassination of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Nara and the recent attack on Prime Minister Kishida in Wakayama. The head of Japan’s National Police Agency and the local police chief resigned following Abe’s assassination due to confirmed “shortcomings” in security arrangements.  Prime Minister Kishida has directed the police to augment security at the G7 summit to ensure a peaceful and worry-free visit for attendees. The summit will host leaders from G7 member countries, including Japan, the United States, Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and the European Union, as well as invited guests like Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi."

In a recorded lecture, the pro-Iranian Shiite cleric repeatedly blamed ""the Jews"" for killing Ali Ibn Abi Talib.  Ali was in fact assassinated, by another Muslim working for a political rival in 661 CE. His son, Hassan, who succeeded his father, was then assassinated nine years later - cementing the schism between the Muslim faithful.  Since Shiites venerate Ali and his son as the rightful successors to their Prophet Mohammad, the death of the two Imam caliphs led to the current division between Sunni and Shiite Islam.  But Iraqi cleric Qais al-Khazali has came up with a new theory: The deaths of Ali and Hassan were at the hands of ""the Jews,"" in particular, the Israeli intelligence service Mossad. First for Ali's death, and then for the deaths of Hassan and his brother Hussein.  ""The Jews! The Jews! The Jews! They murdered Hassan, Ali's son, and they did it using a woman,"" said al-Khazali, claiming that the Mossad used a prostitute for the assassination.  ""The Umayyads were mere collaborators with the Jews. They then assassinated Imam Hussein. They are the same perpetrators, but they used different people.""  https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1657683819347025920 This post can't be displayed because social networks cookies have been deactivated.

At its heart sits a grand mansion in Federal style. Inspired by Roman design, the architectural discipline emerged out of the American Revolution in the late 1700s and early 1800s, and is defined by its simple square or rectangular design, understated facades and simplified columns and mouldings.  The entrance to the main house, which features a poster of its famous former resident. Photo: Sotheby’s International Realty  In addition to Kennedy, several other prominent Americans have called the mansion at 3017 N Street home, including Georgetown mayor Thomas Beall and former Miss America, Yolande Fox. As a result, the estate has been added to the National Register of Historic Places.  The property was also referenced in the 1933 book, A Portrait of Old Georgetown, by local author Grace Dunlop Ecker, who noted how it had contributed to “the character of Georgetown” for generations.  While many of its original features, including a grand main reception hall, original fireplace surrounds and elegant mouldings, have been maintained, the property’s interiors have been entirely renovated. A spacious primary suite is located on the second floor and is fitted with parquet flooring, a private balcony overlooking the rear gardens and a spa-quality bathroom. The third floor is home to four additional en suite bedrooms, as well as a lofted observation deck.  The property at 3003 N St NW was built in 1880 and has five bedrooms, as well as herringbone oak floors. Photo: Sotheby’s International Realty  Kennedy purchased the home at 3017 N Street in December 1963, one week after officially moving out of the White House following the assassination of her husband, John F Kennedy. She and her children moved in on February 1, 1964, with local newspapers providing a play-by-play account of the family’s movements and belongings, accompanied by photographs of her arriving at her new home with the family’s dog, Brumus. A crowd of onlookers gathered outside in the hope of catching a glimpse of her.  She already had a close association with Georgetown, having arrived in Washington from New York at the age of 10. She went on to attend George Washington University and met then-senator John while she was working as a photographer at the Washington Times-Herald. Their courtship largely took place in and around Georgetown.  The master bedroom in the main house. Photo: Sotheby’s International Realty  But her new home did not provide the solace she needed in the wake of her husband’s death. A 1964 article in The Washington Post referred to the residence as a “foremost tourist attraction”, with large groups of sightseers lining the street outside the property each weekend, hoping to catch a glimpse of the former first lady. They left rubbish strewn all over the pavement, while heavy traffic, including tour buses, clogged the streets.  In September 1964, she decided to move back to New York.

Photo: Sotheby’s International Realty  The property has undergone various improvements and owners in the subsequent years and, in 2017, was connected with the two adjacent properties at 3009 and 3003 N St, to create living space spanning more than 16,000 square feet. The 1950s modernist brick-and-concrete structure at 3009 N St NW is home to three bedrooms, while the property at 3003 N St NW was built in 1880 and has five bedrooms, as well as herringbone oak floors and a chef’s kitchen. This brings the total number of rooms across the extended property to 13, all of which have been upgraded.  The entire property is now on the market for $26.5 million, available to buy via Sotheby’s International Realty, which calls it “a home for the most discerning buyer and undoubtedly one of Georgetown’s most storied estates”.

Arnolfo Teves Jr. (Negros Oriental) over the brazen assassination of Governor Roel Degamo that also left nine others dead and more than a dozen injured.  NBI director Medardo de Lemos and other agency officials filed the case before the Department of Justice.  Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla said that Teves was charged with multiple murder, multiple frustrated murder and multiple attempted murder. A prosecution panel was convened yesterday to receive the complaint.  With the complaint now filed, Teves will be given an opportunity to file his counter-affidavit. But Remulla stressed that this cannot be filed while he is not in the country. Teves, who has been refusing to come back to Manila, also cannot subscribe before Philippine embassies abroad, the justice secretary said.  ""He has to come home or they will file the case in court and the warrant will be issued in absentia,"" Remulla said.  Earlier, Teves was also charged with multiple murder over a spate of killings in Negros Oriental in 2019 and illegal possession of firearms and explosives. Process to designate him as a terrorist has also started.  Remulla had long named Teves as the alleged mastermind behind the killing of Degamo but he stressed that investigators were being thorough in their case-building.  The filing, which came more than two months since the incident, was also delayed by two days after witness-suspects under government custody clammed up and refused to cooperate with authorities.  Remulla said the suspects “lawyered up” after initially being represented by the Public Attorney's Office. The justice secretary stressed that investigators already secured testimonies significant to the case before the suspects stopped cooperating.  Teves has yet to return to Manila despite criminal allegations against him and a warning of further disciplinary action for his continued absence at the House of Representatives. — Philstar.com (FREEMAN)"

But the human rights NGOs won’t say anything about it; they only protect the rights of criminals,” stated the president on Twitter.  The National Civil Police (PNC) reported that the officer died after being “attacked” by gang members “while patrolling with other police officers” in Nueva Concepción, Chalatenango, about 85 km north of San Salvador.  This is the fourth Salvadoran police officer killed since Bukele launched his “war” against the gangs 14 months ago and the first one this year, according to Deputy Guillermo Gallegos.  After the incident, a suspected gang member was arrested at the scene.  “Let all the human rights NGOs know that we will devastate these damn killers and their collaborators, we will put them in prison and they will never get out,” emphasized Bukele.  Human rights groups and the Catholic Church have criticized Bukele’s methods for combating the gangs, but his crusade has the support of nine out of ten Salvadorans, according to surveys.  Hours after the officer’s death, the Legislative Assembly approved, with 67 votes out of a total of 84, the extension of the current state of exception, which allows arrests without judicial order, the main tool in Bukele’s “war” against the gangs, which has restored a sense of security on Salvadoran streets.  With this extension, the state of exception will be in effect until June 15.  “Do you see why we must continue with the State of Exception until we completely eradicate this plague? This cowardly murder will not go unpunished. We will make them pay dearly for what they did,” wrote Bukele.  The state of exception was originally declared by the parliament, at Bukele’s request, in response to a surge in homicides that claimed the lives of 87 people from March 25 to 27, 2022.  Since then, 68,720 suspected gang members have been arrested, although about 5,000 have been released for not being linked to these gangs, said the Minister of Justice and Security, Gustavo Villatoro, on Tuesday.  Regarding the alleged deaths of innocent people in prisons reported by human rights organizations, Villatoro said that there is a task force investigating the cases."

President George Washington knew the value of intelligence, but subsequent administrations had other concerns, and creating a spymaster wasn't one of them.  Until the Civil War, U.S. intelligence was virtually nonexistent, and after that, it wasn't very extensive. Lucky for the World War II Allies, the Soviet Union's dedication to spies and intelligence could best be described as paranoia in action.  Gevork Vartanian was a Soviet intelligence officer from Armenia who, at age 19, discovered the Nazis' plan to kill the Allied leadership in Tehran. His team systematically captured and eliminated the assassins' threat.  Soviet-Armenian spy Gevork Vartanian. (Russian Embassy in the United States)  American intelligence before World War II was often as-needed and ad hoc. It could claim some critical successes, but it was far from the global network of informants used by the Soviet Union.  During the war, the USSR housed all its intelligence operations under SMERSH, an umbrella organization composed of hundreds, maybe thousands of operatives.  SMERSH had spies and agents everywhere. As any American Cold Warrior will tell you, Soviet spies were some of the best. They not only spied on the enemy, they were embedded with their own units on the front lines and infiltrated Soviet allies at the highest levels.  The Soviets were so adept at spycraft, Joseph Stalin knew about the development of an atomic bomb before Vice President Harry Truman. So it's no surprise they learned about Operation Long Jump, an assassination plot against Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt -- also known as ""The Big Three.""  Vartanian had been working as an agent in Tehran since before Nazi Germany invaded the USSR. He already had a team of agents called the ""Light Cavalry"" in place and cleared the city of more than 400 Nazi agents before 1943. It made sense to put them in charge of security for the 1943 Tehran Conference between the Big Three, where the leaders would discuss opening a second European front.  The previous year, German Wehrmacht Oberleutnant Paul Siebert, stationed in occupied Ukraine, split a bottle of brandy with his friend. That friend was SS officer Ulrich von Ortel. As the two drank the night away, von Ortel told Siebert that Germany had broken a U.S. Navy radio code and learned about the Tehran Conference.  He then told Siebert about Operation Long Jump and that notorious SS Obersturmbannfuehrer Otto Skorzeny, a saboteur and special operations expert, would lead the assassination squad. Unfortunately for the Germans, Siebert was really Soviet master spy Nikolai Kuznetsov.  Austrian-born Otto Skorzeny during World War II  Word of the plot quickly got to Vartanian in Tehran. The Light Cavalry captured six Nazi radio operators in Iran and tracked the first team of German commandos after they parachuted in near the city of Qom. His team intercepted and arrested the Germans as they traveled on camelback toward the Iranian capital, loaded with weapons.  They then forced the radio operators to report the mission while under Soviet supervision, but one of the radio operators managed to inform Berlin they'd been caught. As a result, Skorzeny's team was never deployed to Iran.  Vartanian spent the next 30 years working as an intelligence officer for the Soviet Union, eventually receiving the title Hero of the Soviet Union, the highest award the country could give. His involvement in preventing Operation Long Jump was kept a secret until 2000, and Vartanian died in 2012 after a very long, very secret career.  -- Blake Stilwell can be reached at blake.stilwell@military.com.

Bogotá, Colombia – A former strongman has wrapped up testimony before Colombia’s Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP) tribunal this week, offering a harrowing look into paramilitary assassination programmes orchestrated during the country’s decades-long internal conflict.  Salvatore Mancuso, who used the nom de guerre “Triple Zero”, was one of the primary leaders of paramilitary forces in the country in the late ’90s and early 2000s.  Over four days of testimony, ending Tuesday, Mancuso offered insight into groups that Colombia’s Peace Commission has since described as “death squads”.  As the erstwhile commander of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), a coalition of right-wing paramilitary groups, Mancuso described the murder and forced disappearances of political activists and other individuals seen as sympathetic to left-wing groups and causes.  “These were assassinations,” he said on the first day of testimony, May 10. “There is no other word for it.”  Mancuso has previously admitted to thousands of counts of various crimes before the JEP, in an attempt to earn leniency and avoid further legal proceedings in Colombia. He gave this week’s testimony by video from the United States, where he previously served 12 years on drug trafficking charges.  “We weren’t told just to kill. We were told to hide the bodies and ensure they were never found,” Mancuso said from a screen before the court.  To cover up their crimes, Mancuso explained his forces built crematoriums to burn the bodies of those killed. Other victims were disposed of in the Catatumbo River, which separates Colombia and Venezuela in the Catatumbo region.  His testimony also corroborated longstanding accusations that paramilitary groups planned their attacks in direct coordination with the Colombian government, as well as the private sector.  A child of state ‘parapolitics’  Mancuso has claimed he worked directly with the Colombian army and police, as well as with the Administrative Security Department (DAS), the country’s disgraced former intelligence agency.  The DAS was disbanded in 2011 amid accusations of human rights violations and the wiretapping of journalists and judges.  Together with the paramilitary forces, those agencies coordinated “kill lists” identifying individuals the government wanted silenced, Mancuso alleged.  “In my capacity as a hinge between public forces and self-defence groups, I ordered the assassination of hundreds of people. I’m a legitimate child of state ‘parapolitics’,” he said on Tuesday, using a term for the intersection of “paramilitary” and “politics”.  According to Mancuso, one of the targets that DAS ordered for assassination was Gustavo Petro, Colombia’s current president and a former rebel fighter who was, at the time, a congressman.  Mancuso also indicated that major private companies helped finance the paramilitary operations through a programme called “Convivir”, in part to protect their domestic infrastructure. The JEP tribunal, however, has yet to verify the claims made in Mancuso’s testimony.  Mancuso left his position as commander in 2005 as part of a controversial peace process with Colombia’s paramilitary forces.  Critics divided over testimony  Observers were split over the revelations from Mancuso’s testimony this week — and how much they would help advance JEP’s mission to investigate the crimes and abuses committed over Colombia’s nearly six-decade-long internal conflict.  Claudia Julieta Duque, a journalist who had been tortured by the DAS, was less than impressed by the four-day judicial hearing.  It was a “victimiser reaffirming what victims have been saying for more than 20 years”, she told Al Jazeera. “He said many things that were already known.”      Elizabeth Dickinson, a senior policy analyst in Colombia for the International Crisis Group, was nevertheless intrigued by some of the insight Mancuso offered.  “One of the most striking and new points of the testimony was Mancuso’s discussion of a period in the late ‘90s when Colombia was receiving increased scrutiny in over rising civilian casualties,” she said.  “And the order, in response, from security forces to the paramilitaries was: Keep doing what you’re doing with these scorched-earth tactics. But instead of leaving evidence of this violence, you need to start disappearing people.”  She said it was “shockingly nefarious” that the government’s response was to allegedly double down on state-sponsored violence rather than re-evaluate its actions.  What’s next for Colombia’s peace process?  When asked what Mancuso’s testimony means for the present day, Dickinson explained that the phenomenon of paying criminal groups for protection — whether willingly or through coercion — is an “ongoing” problem in Colombia.  “The JEP is looking specifically for more information about this. That’s why Mancuso is testifying,” she said. Colombia’s Peace Commission has repeatedly stated that impunity for crimes committed during the internal conflict is a barrier to contemporary peace-building.  Ginna Morelo, an investigative reporter, has written a book, The Voice of the Pencils, that describes an assault that paramilitary forces launched on Colombia’s University of Cordoba — an attack Mancuso addressed in his testimony this week.  She explained that his testimony “contributes to the reconstruction of the truth. Although it hurts so much time has passed without knowing the truth.”  She told Al Jazeera that several victims had told her afterwards that “they had never heard that the DAS was behind the crimes inflicted on them”.  She hoped new information could bring closure to those who suffered during the civil war. The victims, she said, “live in an endless transition in search of clarification and reconciliation that has so far been elusive”."

Kennedy. Displaying little or no fear of either the national-security establishment or of being labeled a “conspiracy theorist,” an increasing number of people are now openly and publicly acknowledging what has increasingly become obvious: that the U.S. national-security establishment orchestrated and carried out Kennedy’s assassination as part of a national-security regime-change operation.  This is a positive and healthy sign. Getting America back on the right track requires confronting this dark legacy of America as a national-security state. That includes confronting all of the Pentagon’s and CIA’s state-sponsored assassinations, but especially the Kennedy assassination. Libertarians can help lead the way out of this darkness by openly and publicly acknowledging and addressing what happened on November 22, 1963, and bringing the light of truth to the American people about this sordid event.  That’s the purpose of my new video series “The JFK Assassination: Sixty Years Later,” which so far consists of six 30-minute episodes.  In the immediate aftermath of the assassination, there was no reasonable possibility that anyone was going to be able to prove that the military-intelligence establishment was behind the assassination. There were lots of anomalies and unusual occurrences that were enough to raise eyebrows, but they certainly weren’t enough to convict the national-security establishment beyond a reasonable doubt.  For example, immediately after the shooting, there were men on the “grassy knoll” who identified themselves as Secret Service agents. They diverted people away from that particular area, which was located in front of the president’s limousine when the shots rang out. The Secret Service later stated that it had no agents in that area.  If the assassination was really committed by a “lone nut” who purportedly shot from the president’s rear, who were those men on the grassy knoll who falsely identified themselves as Secret Service agents? Is that enough to convict the national-security establishment of having orchestrated the assassination? Of course not. But it is certainly enough to raise eyebrows.  At that time, assassinating a president was not a federal crime. That means that this was a straight murder case under Texas state law. The entity that had sole jurisdiction over the crime was Dallas County.  The possibility that Dallas County District Attorney Henry Wade, a conservative Democrat, would even consider targeting the military-intelligence establishment with the crime was non-existent. As an establishment public official, his mind would have never moved in that direction. In fact, he immediately concluded that the assassination had been carried out as part of an international communist conspiracy. But displaying a classic mindset of deference to authority, Wade quickly acceded to President Lyndon Johnson’s demand to abandon the communist-conspiracy allegation and settle for a lone-nut theory of the assassination.  Moreover, there was never any reasonable possibility that any of the orchestrators of the assassination or any of the shooters would talk. These were professionals. All of them understood the need for absolute secrecy, especially given that this was the assassination of a U.S. president. In fact, from the inception of the CIA, the policy had always been to never put any reference to any state-sponsored assassination in writing.  However, as I am demonstrating in my new video series, the Achilles heel of the assassination was always the autopsy that the national-security establishment conducted on President Kennedy’s body after the assassination. That’s because the people who participated in the autopsy were not part of the assassination itself. Therefore, they didn’t have the same incentive to keep silent as those who orchestrated and carried out the assassination itself.  This is why the military’s autopsy was “classified” and why participants in the autopsy were sworn to secrecy and forced to sign written secrecy oaths. Enlisted personnel who participated in the autopsy were severely threatened with court-martial and criminal prosecution if they ever revealed what they had seen or done during the autopsy.  Among the most unusual — and revealing — aspects of the military autopsy was the response of the mainstream press. No one questioned that it was the military-intelligence establishment that was carrying out the autopsy. It was considered to be perfectly normal. The acquiescence of the mainstream press revealed the extent to which the press had come to accept that America had become a military nation — that is, one in which the federal government was now controlled by the military-intelligence establishment.  The secrecy surrounding the assassination was extremely successful. To this day, while we can identify likely suspects in the CIA and the military who orchestrated the assassination, there is still insufficient evidence to convict any of them beyond a reasonable doubt. We also do not know — and will never know — the identities of the people who actually did the shooting.  That, however, is irrelevant. What matters is that the evidence establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that this was, in fact, a national-security regime-change operation, one no different in principle than the ones carried out against political leaders in Iran (1953), Guatemala (1954), and Congo (1961) and that would later be carried out against the democratically elected president of Chile (1973).  To what evidence of guilt am I referring? The evidence surrounding the autopsy. While the plotters were highly successful in maintaining strict secrecy surrounding the autopsy for a very long period of time, ultimately the dam of secrecy cracked open, especially during the term of the Assassination Records Review Board in the 1990s.  But that was 30 years after the assassination! That is a very long time. That’s a very effective cover-up, especially because by that time, the mainstream press had fallen under the complete control of the national-security establishment and, therefore, was not permitted to investigate the evidence of fraud in the autopsy that was uncovered by the ARRB. (I’ll be covering such fraud in my new video series. In the meantime, see my books The Kennedy Autopsy, The Kennedy Autopsy 2, and An Encounter with Evil: The Abraham Zapruder Story.)  For example, as I detail in the early episodes of my new series, the evidence is overwhelming that military-intelligence personnel sneaked President Kennedy’s body into the Bethesda, Maryland, military morgue almost 1 and 1/2 hours before the official entry time of 8 pm on the evening of the assassination. Why would they do that? And why would they lie about that? Why would they cover it up? What did they do to JFK’s body during that 1 and 1/2 hours? Alas, not one investigative reporter for any mainstream newspaper investigated the matter. By the 1990s, the national-security establishment’s control over the mainstream press had become complete.  The most important part of the Kennedy assassination is the “why” of the assassination. By understanding why the national-security establishment deemed it necessary to orchestrate one of its patented regime-change operations on American soil, we can gain an understanding of why America is mired in perpetual war, strife, conflict, militarism, out-of-control spending, monetary debauchery, a national police state, and empire. (See FFF’s book JFK’s War with the National Security Establishment: Why Kennedy Was Assassinated by Douglas Horne. Also, see JFK and the Unspeakable: Why He Died and Why It Matters by James W. Douglass.)  If you are not already doing so, I would invite you to view my new series: The JFK Assassination: Sixty Years Later — Episode 1. If you like it, please recommend it to your friends and mailing lists. As more Americans become aware of this dark legacy of America as a national-security state and, equally important, as more Americans lose their fear of being labeled “conspiracy theorists,” we stand a greater chance of restoring liberty, peace, prosperity, and harmony to our land."

Reacting over the ugly situation, through a press statement by the Organization, the Facilitator/Director General of the Grow Orlu Project, Prince Nixon Okwara described the incident as most unfortunate and barbaric.  Captain Tony Enoch was gunned down by assailants late hours of Tuesday, May 9, 2023 on his way coming back from an APC Stakeholders meeting held in his Oru East Local Government Area of Imo State.  Against this backdrop, Prince Nixon Okwara who couldn’t contain his tears stated that it has become so worrisome why people could condescend so low and inhuman as to taking another person’s life.  He regretted that Captain Tony Enoch’s assassination was still a rude shock to the Grow Orlu family, the Kpakpando political family, to Oru East, Imo State and Nigeria at large, especially those who encountered him while he lived.  The Director General recalled that due to his outstanding nature and Leadership dexterity, the murdered Tony Enoch was entrusted with the position of Coordinator of all the Coordinators at the inauguration of the Grow Orlu Project held on July 9, 2022.  Alas, when it was almost time to enjoy his Labour, his life was cut short by yet-to-be identified killers.  Prince Nixon Okwara who also doubles as a member of the Presidential Campaign Council for Bola Ahmed Tinubu/Kashim Shettima passionately enthused, “Quite a horrible Tuesday!! Our hearts are heavy with grief, sadness, and pain.  “Capt. Enoch was a great and exceptional member and the general Coordinator of our team, “The Grow Orlu Project” who made significant contributions to our group. His smart disposition, intellect, tireless work ethic, and unwavering commitment to the victory of our party and candidates were made manifest in that successful outing on the 25th of February elections.  “This is one but many losses to us, “The Grow Orlu Project”, the Kpakpando family, and the entire APC family. We condemn in strong terms this dastardly act and senseless act of violence in our region and call for justice. Capt. will not die in vain.  “To his immediate family, we share in their grief at this difficult time. Capt. will be missed by all who know him, both for his professionalism and dedication to the assignments. His killers will never know peace both here on Earth and beyond”.  The sober Facilitator of the Grow Orlu Project however called of the State Government, the security agencies to as a matter of urgent State importance fish out the perpetrators of the heinous crime so as to save the State from further tragedy.  He submitted that the Grow Orlu Project as part of its cardinal duties is aimed at ensuring a transparent and effective governance.  He fervently prayed for the peaceful repose of the fallen icon, Capt. Tony Enoch.  Until his death, the late Captain Tony Enoch held sway as the Oru East APC Campaign Council which saw to the landslide victory of all the APC Candidates in the recently held Presidential, National Assembly and State Assembly polls where Oru East LGA recorded tremendous victories in each."

In a two-minute video filmed at Mahan Air’s maintenance hangar in the Imam Khomeini International Airport outside Tehran and released on IRNA’s social media platforms, a reporter can be heard saying that repair work on the Aeroflot aircraft, originally built in 2011, has commenced.  “The market for commercial aircraft repair and maintenance services is as valuable and extensive as the commercial aircraft’s sales market itself. Accordingly, for years, we have been witnessing the achievements and capabilities of [Iran] to localise the needs of this industry,” the IRNA reporter says, labelling Mahan Air’s maintenance hangar as “one of the most well-known and strategic centres” serving Iranian and foreign customers.  According to aviation news platform Simply Flying, the Airbus A330 had departed Moscow’s Sheremetyevo International Airport on 5 April and arrived at the Imam Khomeini International Airport the following morning.  This development comes amid US-led sanctions on both Aeroflot and Mahan Air due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and an alleged plot to assassinate Saudi Arabia’s ambassador to America in 2011.  The engagement between Aeroflot and Mahan Air also serves as an example of the strengthening of relations between Iran and Russia, following such sanctions.  In August 2022, Simply Flying reported that the two nations had signed a cooperation agreement for Iranian-made equipment and aircraft parts as well as carrying out “repair and maintenance services and technical support” of Russian aircraft.  This year has seen the relationship between Iran and Russia evolve further, with Tehran inking a deal to buy Sukhoi Su-35 fighter jets from Moscow in March. The two countries also linked their interbank communication and transfer systems to facilitate trade and transactions in the light of US sanctions.

The world’s fifth most populous country is no stranger to political unrest. No prime minister has ever completed their tenure in Pakistan’s history, but never before has a politician challenging the country’s all-powerful military and intelligence services, known as the establishment, enjoyed such public support.  One week ago, on May 9, former Prime Minister Imran Khan was violently beaten and then detained by the country’s paramilitary. This led to several days of rioting across Pakistan.  While he has since been released – after Pakistan’s Supreme Court ruled that his detention on an alleged land fraud charge was “invalid” and “unlawful” – the current stalemate will be temporary, not permanent.

Ousted from power in April 2022 in a no confidence vote after falling out with the country’s establishment, Khan’s popularity is now at an all-time high. There is little doubt that if free elections are held, as planned, in the autumn, he will return as prime minister. The Pakistani people are seemingly prepared to take on the country’s establishment, for the first time in history, in an attempt to ensure that happens.  With neither side backing down, what comes next is likely to involve serious unrest. Things are sure to get worse before they get better in Pakistan, which is also already enduring the gravest economic crisis in the country’s history.  It was unsurprising to see Khan in the dock last week. Pakistan’s establishment and the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party – headed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif – seeks to disqualify Khan from politics.  Advertisement  The former international cricket captain is facing more than 140 criminal cases. In the latest, it was alleged that Khan and his wife, the Sufi mystic Bushra Wattoo, secured lucrative real estate in exchange for carrying out favors for Malik Riaz Hussain, one of Pakistan’s wealthiest businessmen, while Khan was prime minister.  Khan and his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party said the case was politically motivated. The PML-N said Khan should face trial. On Friday, after the country’s Supreme Court sided with the former premier, Khan was released and returned to his home in Lahore.  It seems certain, though, that Khan will be arrested again. He has only been granted bail until Wednesday and Sharif and his allies have suggested he will be detained again this week.  On Sunday, Khan himself suggested he would be jailed for 10 years for sedition after his supporters had rioted following his arrest.  “Absolutely, Mr. Khan will be arrested again. We are looking at a judiciary in Pakistan which is fragmented and can be influenced,” argued Dr. Avinash Paliwal, associate professor in International Relations at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS).  “The ruling [on Friday] was made by pro-Khan judges within the Supreme Court and now the Army will try to fix that. It will 100 percent happen at some point that he will be behind bars and charges will be brought against him that no court can overrule.”  In many ways, Khan, a populist politician, is a victim of his own success. Since his ousting, in April 2022, which directly followed a spectacular falling out with the military, his popularity has surged.  Enjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access.

Food inflation is running at 40 percent, the highest in Asia, and approximately 70 million Pakistanis are going hungry, as per a March study by the Wilson Center, a leading U.S. think tank.  Hospitals have run out of many life-saving medicines, including those used in diabetes, heart and kidney disease treatment, while a lack of funding meant Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, one of Pakistan’s four provinces, suspended free medical care on May 2.  Advertisement  Relief does not seem imminent, either. Negotiations with the International Monetary Fund for over $1.1 billion in funding have broken down – in part due to Sharif’s reluctance to impose further unpopular austerity measures on the population as an election draws near.  Certainly, there have been decades of economic mismanagement in Pakistan. The country has consistently borrowed beyond its means and failed to diversify its tax base. And Khan’s detractors argue that he engaged in corruption, as have the Sharifs and Pakistan’s other political dynasty, the Bhuttos.  Nevertheless, Khan has carefully crafted a victim narrative since he was removed from power and has convinced a significant majority of Pakistanis that only he can reform the country’s stagnant political and economic apparatus.  His approval rating in February was 61 percent, according to a Gallup Pakistan survey, with Shehbaz Sharif trailing far behind at 32 percent.  “Imran Khan, politically, has captured the imagination of most of the country, certainly in Punjab and that is not going to go down. The people’s power is with him,” said Paliwal.  “He wants an early election and if the authorities give him an honest vote, then he will win.”  The establishment will do anything they can to stop him. Khan would fail to do their bidding; he could strip them of their power and even seek to jail senior military or political figures in revenge.  Khan has accused Major General Faisal Naseer, a senior military figure and Sharif of being behind an assassination attempt in November in which he was shot in the legs four times. While on his release from prison, he accused the country’s new chief of army staff, General Asim Munir, of being behind his arrest.  Khan and Munir have a long-standing feud. While he was prime minister, Khan removed Munir as the head of Pakistan’s intelligence services after the latter began allegedly investigating his third wife, Wattoo, for corruption.  We are now likely to see Sharif and his establishment allies take further action against the judiciary and the PTI’s leadership to weaken protection of Khan.  On Monday, hundreds of members of the PML-N, armed with sticks, broke into the country’s Supreme Court to threaten its judges.  Pakistan’s parliament further announced it would set up a committee to prepare a case against the judge, Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial, who had ordered Khan’s release.

Following Khan’s arrest, the PTI called on Pakistanis to take to the streets and it is certain to do so again if Khan is re-arrested. The violence that followed was unprecedented in the country’s history, as large swathes of angry protesters torched military buildings, including the army’s headquarters in Rawalpindi.  Only when Khan was released on Friday did unrest subside. The PTI claims at least 47 of its supporters were killed by the military; the latter puts the death toll at nine.  Khan says 7,000 PTI workers – including much of the party’s senior leadership – have been jailed. Claims of torture are widespread. The elderly relatives and minor children of PTI members have also been arrested in an attempt to lure their relatives out of hiding.  Sharif has said he will come down with an “iron fist” against the protesters and mass arrests will now follow. The ability of Sharif and the establishment to incite fear among Pakistanis is perhaps their best chance of holding onto power.  “To me, it is clear that only one – either Mr. Khan or the army chief – can survive this crisis, politically,” argued Uzair Younus, director of the Pakistan Initiative at the Atlantic Council, a U.S.-based think tank.  “Over the next few weeks, how this situation plays out will come down to General Munir and the armed forces ability to assert themselves and then Mr. Khan and the PTI’s ability to maintain public protests and the momentum.”  Several further variables could influence events in Pakistan. First, there appear to be fractures among the country’s senior military leaders, although it is unclear as to their severity.  Many commanders remain pro-Khan from his time as premier, and it was notable that during the recent violence former army figureheads, many now living abroad, directed protesters. Several acting military commanders also refused to take a heavy-handed approach against PTI supporters.  During previous crises, foreign powers, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States, have also intervened to mediate. This has not occurred this time around, at least openly. But it is unlikely that China, which has invested around $65 billion in Pakistan as part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, or India, which has fought four wars with its neighbor, will continue to watch on if law and order deteriorates.  One victor from the crisis is likely to be the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an Islamic militant group allied with the Afghan Taliban, who called off their ceasefire with the Pakistani state in November.  The TTP has since launched daily attacks against the police and military. January 2023 was the deadliest month for the country’s security forces in a decade, with one such suicide attack on a mosque in Peshawar killing 83 people.  A united front will have to be presented against the emboldened TTP – otherwise Pakistan risks descending into total anarchy."

The practice of mudslinging, smear campaigning, or forming conspiracy by any political leader against his opponent with sole intention to defame a leader with probity in public life and/or to tarnish his image to take political mileage, however, can hardly succeed as ultimately truth prevails, sooner or later. Most of the politicians in India often use ‘mudslinging’ as the most powerful weapon or tool against their opponents.  Since times immemorial, it has been believed that, truth always triumphs and this dictum has been rightly emphasised by Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhi who brought freedom for the country used to define political course to remain “without malice and in a strictly non violent manner,” but now malice is deeply rooted in politics of all shades in which mudslinging has substantially grown as a culture, breeding various connotations, namely, smear campaign, character assassination, dirty politics, negative campaign, defamation, outracing each other which are disastrous for the health of democracy. No political party seems to be an exception from such Machiavellian culture.  In the year 2000, a Congress worker of Poirashi GP of Ganjam block had filed a false affidavit against the then Deputy Speaker of Assembly Rama Chandra Panda, willfully dragging his name to an incident of a crime perpetuated by local Leftist elements, notwithstanding the soaring relationship Panda had with the local Leftists, which was used to orchestrate a political campaign in the Chhatrapur Assembly constituency against Panda.  As a result, Panda had informed the then Speaker of the Assembly not to chair Assembly proceedings till his name was cleared in the Crime Branch inquiry. It was also then whispered in the town that, some Congress leaders eventually had met the then DIG inquiring the matter at the IRE Guest House to raise a complaint against Panda on the basis of the false affidavit.  The catchphrase the ""Truth always triumphs"" has come true though little late. In the last week of January 2023, Panda was felicitated on completion of 50 years of his political journey from the tiny industrial town Ganjam, where he had laid country’s first and historic farmers’ movement (1970-71) against water and air pollution in which he and 400 farmers and youths were imprisoned causing visit of Parliamentary Committee headed by late MP Brahmananda Panda to the area to study the environmental problems which eventually submitted its report to the Parliament suggesting remedial measures. This impressive felicitation programme in which thousands of local people attended is understood to be a sequel to non-invitation to Panda by the local MLA earlier on the party’s foundation day held at village Kushapalli.  The success of this gathering, however, not only sent ripples to various quarters but also produced multiple side effects and one such fallout was that, the then Congress youth leader Khalli Reddy who himself participated in the ‘show of strength’ cum felicitation meeting, later called on Panda at his residence at Brahmapur in the presence of a former Councilor of Ganjam NAC Lakshmi Padhi and advocate Pramod Panda and apologised to Rama Chandra Panda for his 2000 bogus affidavit candidly confessing that he filed the same at the behest of a prominent Congress leader of Brahmapur who eventually is now in BJD. This sensitive exposure of Reddy has proved how some new breed and ambitious politicians can settle political scores against their rivals or political opponents to satisfy their political interests and can go to any extent even to defame a honest leader having probity in public life.  This writer was present during Reddy’s disclosure. In his quest for truth, the writer contacted one of the outspoken and vibrant Congress leaders of Ganjam advocate Pitabas Panda, who too expressed his regret while further attributing the incident to the invisible hand of a former Congress MLA of a neighboring district in the incident. When this writer sought reaction from former Deputy Speaker Panda he said he had already forgotten the incident and wished almighty to bless the indulgent not to repeat such act in future against any one.  There may not always be legal repercussions for mudslinging, but there can be social backfiring. If miscalculated, mudslinging often can make the mudslinger cut a sorry figure.  Now, one might ask: Shouldn't politicians or public figures, face repercussions for mudslinging? According to Joseph Comunale, it is in fact a crime to make false public accusations with knowledge that the claims are indeed false.  Such a crime can lead to libel or defamation lawsuits in the eyes of law. However, proving such a crime can be extremely difficult. i.e., it is difficult to verify that someone may have been aware that he was making a false claim and, therefore, deduce he was knowingly lying with an intent to harm.  There are a number of such incidents of political mudslinging and conspiracy, allegation and counter allegation against each other in Indian politics. Take the example of Telangana Welfare and Civil Supplies Minister, Gangula Kamalakar’s allegation against BJP State president Bandi Sanjay Kumar alleging his hand in a recent question paper leaking incident reportedly with an attempt to malign and defame the BRS Government in Telangana.

Parhar writes that over the past 40 to 50 years, Sikhs have earned a highly respected position in foreign countries through their hard work and talent. Unfortunately, these achievements are now being overshadowed by the actions of those who are intent on sowing discord.  The stain of terrorism on Sikhs associated with the Air India plane incident in June 1985 has not yet been washed away, and daily fights over money boxes and control in gurudwaras, international students’ hooliganism, Sikh youths being caught in drug smuggling, killings in gang wars, unscrupulous and unconstitutional entrances into politics, and immigration fraud are bringing shame to the entire community.  These people have been suppressing the voice of the general public in the name of freedom of speech for some time now. Threats on social media, obscene language, slurs, and character assassination are being used to stop people from speaking their minds, according to Parhar in the Khalsa Vox article.  Sikh scholar Ajmer Singh in one of his videos mentioned that Amritpal Singh was involved in a troll army, which harasses people with the aforementioned actions.  “We could indeed scrutinize the violent actions and hooliganism being committed by this small section of our community in India and abroad, but how will you counter the impact it’s having on the perception of all Sikhs,” asks Parhar.

The musical by David Byrne is based on the rise and fall of former Philippine first lady Imelda Marcos.  David Byrne's Imelda Marcos musical is coming to Broadway in June  Jose Llana, who plays the role of Ferdinand Marcos Sr., said the musical is a cautionary tale for the world to see.  ""[It’s] showing people what happens when you elect popular candidates in a very popular election,” he said. “Then they have a party for 20 years. But what’s even more important is we show what happens after. Hangover comes and the lights turn on, and it’s called the People Power Revolution.”  Disney Princess Arielle Jacobs, known for her role as Princess Jasmine in Aladdin on Broadway, will step into the shoes of Imelda.  She believes this part of Philippine history is a story that needs to be told to a new generation.  “There's so many democracies at stake all around the world,” she said. “And there are countries all around the world that [want] to rewrite history.”  Jacobs added: “I think “Here Lies Love” shines a light on our history and it really shines a light more specifically on the people who led the revolution, the people who fought for democracy.”  “Here Lies Love” takes the audience back to the 70’s and the 80’s disco club scene in New York.  Bryne said the disco-driven musical brings to life Imelda’s lavish lifestyle in New York, and her endless parties with the Big Apple’s elite.  It will feature an all-Filipino cast for the first time on Broadway.  Conrad Ricamora plays the late senator Benigno “Ninoy” Aquino III, whose assassination in 1983, led to the bloodless revolt three years later.  “There’s never been an all-Filipino cast on Broadway,” he said. “We’re all energized and extra excited to tell our story in a revolutionary way.”  Playing the role of Ninoy’s mother Aurora is award-winning singer and actress Lea Salonga.  Lea Salonga joins cast of 'Here Lies Love' on Broadway  “On one level, the song is gorgeous but on a whole other level, it’s heartbreaking because this character is talking about her son,” she said.  “Here Lies Love” previews start on June 17 and opens on July 20 at the Broadway Theater in New York City."

This article is available exclusively for our subscribers, who help fund our work at The Baltimore Sun.  Sen. Chris Van Hollen, left, and Sen. Ben Cardin often appear together to draw attention to federal projects in Maryland but, in their roles as U.S. senators, pursue global causes, including human rights and press freedom. (Amy Davis, Baltimore Sun)  Human rights tops Ben Cardin’s list of accomplishments as a senator — specifically, his sponsorship of the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, a law imposing economic sanctions on bad actors in Russia and around the world.  There are other items on Cardin’s list: Subsidies for small business; federal funds for the Chesapeake Bay; improving ways for Americans to save for retirement; addressing health disparities.  Advertisement  But the Magnitsky Act sits at the top.  That says something not only about Cardin but about the scope of the work of a serious U.S. senator, something often lost in the political antics and demagoguery inflicted on us daily by buffoons and nascent fascists in the House of Representatives and the capitals of red states.  Advertisement  Cardin, at 79 the senior of Maryland’s two Democratic senators, has decided not to run for reelection in 2024. The person who wins his seat will not only have to be responsive to the needs of Marylanders but have a grasp of the far-reaching and complex issues that affect the nation and the world. A senator has to paint the big picture and stand up for freedom and human rights at home and abroad.  That too often goes without saying, so I’ll cite two examples — global causes Cardin and Sen. Chris Van Hollen pursue when they’re not, as they were Monday in Baltimore, addressing issues immediate to the state they represent.  The Magnitsky Act is named for the late Sergei Magnitsky, the Ukraine-born tax adviser who exposed multimillion-dollar fraud and corruption in Vladimir Putin’s regime and Russia’s state-owned businesses. Magnitsky was arrested on dubious charges and imprisoned for 11 months without a trial and without the medical attention he badly needed. He died in his cell in November 2009 at age 37. His untreated ailments or a beating, or both, caused Magnitsky’s death.  Cardin and the late Arizona Republican, John McCain, sponsored the Magnitsky Act in the Senate. It passed overwhelmingly in 2012, barring Russians and other human rights violators from entering the U.S. and freezing any assets they held in American banks. The law makes an important connection between trade agreements and human rights.  “America’s strength is in our values,” Cardin has said. “We must defend human rights and hold abusers accountable.”  These days, we don’t hear enough of that kind of high-minded talk, delivered with sober sincerity.  Magnitsky sanctions came to the forefront again in 2018, after the brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi journalist and Washington Post columnist. While U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that the Saudi Crown Prince ordered an assassination team to kill Khashoggi, the Trump administration refused to enact Magnitsky sanctions against him. And while President Joe Biden called Saudi Arabia “a pariah state” during the 2020 campaign and later applied Magnitzky to more than a dozen individuals connected with Khashoggi’s murder, his administration concluded the Crown Prince had head of state immunity.  Cardin still disagrees.  Advertisement  “I was disappointed,” he says, “to see that the Biden administration did not directly sanction Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, especially since we know from our intelligence community that the crown prince approved the killing of Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul, Turkey. I was pleased to see the administration applying Global Magnitsky sanctions on 17 individuals for their roles in the brutal murder, but I do believe we remain far from delivering justice for Mr. Khashoggi and his family.”  Still, based on the latest report published in the Federal Register, there’s good reason to see human rights as Cardin’s crowning achievement: Magnitsky sanctions have been applied against 450 corrupt actors so far, and at least 12 other nations have adopted a Magnitsky-style apparatus for punishing human rights violators.  Van Hollen, meanwhile, has taken up press freedom, at home and abroad.  Among his current efforts is a push for an independent investigation of the death of journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, a Palestinian-American and longtime television reporter for Al-Jazeera. She was fatally shot in the head a year ago this month while covering an Israeli military raid in the occupied West Bank.  Palestinian authorities claim Abu Akleh, who was wearing a helmet and press vest, had been killed by an armor-piercing bullet fired by an Israeli soldier. Israel said the source of the bullet could not be determined. A team of New York Times journalists used satellite imagery and video taken on the ground to conclude that the fatal bullet probably came from an Israeli military convoy and was most likely fired by a soldier from an elite unit.  Last week, on the anniversary of Abu Akleh’s death, Van Hollen renewed his call for an independent investigation.  Advertisement  “Protecting journalists is essential to protecting facts and the truth,” he said Monday. “We need to do more than talk about it, we need to insist on accountability.”  Van Hollen had just come from a walking tour of retail businesses in downtown Baltimore, with a focus on those owned by Black entrepreneurs. Cardin, Rep. Kwiesi Mfume and Isabella Casillas Guzman, administrator of the Small Business Administration, were with him.  “That, obviously, is a major focus,” Van Hollen said, “trying to make sure that we invest in Baltimore, make sure that the city can grow and prosper and deal with the many challenges that it faces.”  Then the senator said the thing that too often goes without saying:  “But it’s also important that we remember America’s role in the world. We have to support democracy and freedom of the press and human rights.”"

Kirchner accused the judiciary and the Supreme Court of imposing a “political ban” not only against her but the Peronist party as a whole.  “I’ve already said this on December 6, 2022. I am not going to be the mascota del poder (puppet for the powerful) for any candidacy,” she said. That day, she was handed a six-year prison sentence and a prospective lifetime ban from holding public office in the Vialidad case in which she was found guilty of fraudulently awarding public works contracts during her terms as president. She is still legally allowed to run for office until all instances of appeal have been exhausted.  “The conviction and ban, in this case, has only one political and electoral translation: a political ban.”  Kirchner contends in the letter that the Supreme Court is purposefully persecuting Peronism, dubbing it the “Judicial Party.” She drew parallels between her potential candidacy and the recent fallout over the Court suspending elections in San Juan and Tucumán.  “Just as three people [the justices of the Supreme Court] did it with the provinces of Tucumán and San Juan,” she said. “I have no doubt that they will do it against me in order to prevent Peronism from participating in the democratic process, or to weaken it, leading us to a dead end.”  Last week, the Supreme Court published preliminary rulings which declared the ineligibility of Tucumán and San Juan’s governors to run for reelection, suspending the provincial elections via precautionary measures in response to complaints filed by the opposition.  You may also be interested in: Supreme Court lifts Tucumán election suspension  Kirchner also said in the letter that since 2016, the so-called “Judicial Party […] works as a task force for Juntos por el Cambio [the main opposition coalition].” She also accused the Clarín newspaper of being “the main source for spreading hatred towards me and my family,” of lamenting the failed assassination attempt against her, and of anticipating the Vialidad case ruling.  “We must be intelligent in order to get out of this labyrinth and break the trap into which they want to lead us: that we have a candidacy forbidden by the Judicial Party,” she wrote.  Kirchner also deemed it “essential” to draw up a “government program that will enamor Argentine men and women again and convince them that a better country is not only possible but also desirable. A government program that is necessary not only for Peronism but for the democratic system as a whole.”  She also spoke about the country’s economic turmoil –including the “bimonetary” nature of the economy, record-high inflation, and exchange runs against the peso-, and the role of the International Monetary Fund (IMF.)  “This makes it impossible for any government to reasonably manage the natural distributive struggle for income and turns inflation into the most phenomenal instrument for the transfer of resources from society as a whole to the richest and most concentrated sectors of the economy,” she wrote.  “It is no coincidence that neither of the two Presidents who accepted the IMF program [referring to former President Mauricio Macri and incumbent Alberto Fernández] retains electoral aptitude,” she added, referring to her own political partner.  The current government and the IMF signed an Extended Fund Facility agreement in 2022 after renegotiating the US$44 billion debt former President Mauricio Macri acquired in 2018. The deal includes an economic program that Argentina must comply with in order to receive disbursements every three months, which are used to pay for the previous debt with the IMF.  Kirchner also said that “democracy lost in the economic arena, it degraded itself in social matters, and started to break down politically and institutionally.”  “An important part of the citizenship does not feel that democracy contains themselves or their aspirations,” she wrote.  — Reporting by Facu Iglesia and Valen Iricibar"

The event has been revived after almost eight years and will be the company's latest event in Saudi Arabia. The previous Night of Champions was held on September 20, 2015, at Toyota Center in Houston, Texas.  Speaking of events in Saudi Arabia, it so happens that certain WWE Superstars have decided to forgo a good payday by refusing to perform at events that happen in the country. On the other hand, certain superstars weren't allowed to perform in Saudi.  Here is the list of WWE Superstars who refused or weren't allowed to perform in Saudi Arabia:  #5. John Cena (Refused)  When WWE signed a ten-year contract with Saudi Arabia in 2018, it was the beginning of ensuring the product was being broadcasted to a global audience. To promote the new relationship, the event featured a singles tournament. In that tournament, one of the advertised superstars was John Cena.  However, when Bobby Lashley was announced as Cena's replacement, it raised eyebrows, given The All Mighty never qualified in the first place. Turns out, The Champ had refused to be a part of the 2018 Crown Jewel in Saudi Arabia as a result of former Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi's alleged assassination.  During the time when Cena refused to perform in Saudi Arabia, he was one of the most heavily advertised superstars for the event.  #4. Sami Zayn (Wasn't allowed)  The current Undisputed WWE Tag Team Champion has never performed in Saudi Arabia. It so happens that Sami Zayn is of Syrian descent, and the relations between Syria and Saudi Arabia used to be in a state of constant unrest.  While speaking on Blindboy podcast in 2020, Zayn discussed his stance on the company's partnership with Saudi Arabia.  ""WWE did a thing, a partnership sort of or signed some sort of deal to put on these shows in Saudi Arabia for I don’t know, what, 10 years or something like that. And I just wasn’t invited to go and I never really dug into it too much because I wasn’t keen on going to begin with, but I would like to discuss that”  However, recent improvements in Saudi Arabia and Syria's diplomatic relations may have convinced the company to include Sami Zayn in the event. Since he is one of the most over superstars among fans, his inclusion should fetch positive results for WWE.  #3. Kevin Owens (Refused)  The current Undisputed WWE Tag Team Champion has previously refused to perform in Saudi Arabia, even though he is scheduled for Night of Champions on May 27, 2023.  It's well-known that Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn are extremely close friends and have been together since their time in the independent wrestling circuit. Therefore, Owens refused to work in Saudi Arabia as a gesture of support towards Sami Zayn, who was not allowed (or never asked) to perform at previous events in Saudi Arabia.  However, Kevin Owens' stance may have changed, given Roman Reigns and Solo Sikoa are supposed to battle Zayn and him at Night of Champions for the Undisputed Tag Team Title. Owens' decision to perform at Night of Champions could be attributed to WWE, including Sami Zayn.  #2. Aleister Black (Wasn't allowed)  Former WWE Superstar Aleister Black did not perform or rather wasn't allowed to perform in Saudi Arabia because of his tattoos that are related to religion.  Black has tattoos that portray Lilith, the demonic figure who stole babies at night, and Yama. Given that Saudi Arabia's stance on religion is rather strict, Black's tattoos will not go down well with the country.  As a result, the promotion never showed any major interest in booking him for Saudi Arabia events, regardless of his talents.  #1. Daniel Bryan (Refused) to work WWE Night of Champions  Former WWE Superstar Daniel Bryan has refused to perform in Saudi Arabia for more than one reason.  Bryan did not want to be a part of Crown Jewel in 2018 because of the same reason as John Cena, i.e., due to the alleged assassination of former Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Furthermore, the inaugural Greatest Royal Rumble event was held on April 27, 2018, in Saudi Arabia, but women weren't allowed to perform. This left a poor impression of Saudi Arabia events in Daniel Bryan's mind.  Finally, another reason why Daniel Bryan refused to perform in Saudi Arabia was due to the country's treatment of the LGBTQ community.

The monument was made by the eminent Spanish sculptor Mariano Benlliure (1862-1947), who is known for his neoclassic public monuments in Madrid and elsewhere that make even a clerk like Fergusson into a heroic figure.  It is a reunion of sorts to have this Benlliure work in the National Museum because the Spanish sculptor met a number of Filipino artists who were affiliated with the Spanish Academy in Rome like Juan Luna, Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo and Miguel Zaragoza.  The monument has been loaned by the US Embassy to the National Museum, and it now stands in the main hall of the National Gallery of Art— between Juan Luna’s iconic “Spoliarium” and Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo’s equally violent “Assassination of Governor Bustamante,” previously known under the more controversial title “La iglesia contra el estado”  The extension will last through 2025. The previous agreement expired last year.  Meanwhile, US Ambassador Marykay Carlson said that the state visit to the US by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. was a successful one.  “President Marcos had a series of really important engagements and i think coming out of the visit I think US-Philippines (relations) catapulted up to an even better level than before which was even harder to imagine because we are already in a great trajectory. But he had great engagements with members of our cabinet of course in the Oval Office with the President, the Vice President,” Carlson said.  "

The nine-foot-tall portrait, painted by W.F.K. Travers in 1865, is one of only three known full-length renderings of the 16th president and will be on loan to the Smithsonian gallery in Washington, D.C., for the next five years.  The painting, which hung for decades in a municipal building in a small New Jersey town, has been restored and is now part of the “America’s Presidents” gallery.  Lincoln sat for Travers in 1864 and Travers completed the oil painting in Germany shortly after Lincoln’s assassination in April 1865. Travers then sold the painting to an American diplomat living in Frankfurt. In 1876, the painting was displayed at an exposition in Philadelphia, where Mary Todd Lincoln was reportedly, “so overcome by its lifelike appearance that she fainted and was carried out of the hall.”  Rare painting of President Abraham Lincoln. (National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution)  For years, it hung in the U.S. Capitol while Congress considered whether to purchase it, but it was ultimately sold to the Rockefeller family. In the 1930s, Geraldine Rockefeller Dodge—daughter of William Jr. and niece of John D.—built the Hartley Dodge Memorial Building in memory of her deceased son and filled it with art, including the Lincoln portrait.  In 2017, an archivist discovered that a marble bust of Napoleon sitting in the corner of the council room of the Hartley Dodge Memorial Building had been sculpted by Auguste Rodin, prompting the foundation to reassess all of the art in its collection. The loan of the Lincoln portrait to the National Portrait Gallery is part of that reassessment.  In addition to Lincoln’s likeness, the painting is filled with symbols noting the president’s place in history. He stands in front of a bust of George Washington and a rendering of the painting “Washington Crossing the Delaware” by Emanuel Leutze. Lincoln’s hand rests on a bound copy of the Constitution, next to a scroll bearing a draft of the 13th Amendment. Behind the scroll is a small statue of an African American man rising as he pulls the chains from his body.  This story appeared in the 2023 Summer issue of American History magazine."

The youngest members of the group are distributing the usual dates and coffee with cardamom to people who come to offer their condolences.  On a poster showing the faces of Jamal Khaswan and his son Yousef, there are no emblems of Palestinian militias, and no photos of well-known Palestinian leaders such as Yasser Arafat, Ahmed Yasin or Mohammed Dahlan. Instead, there are only three logos: one from the city’s Al Wafa hospital — where the deceased had served as chairman of the board —, another one from a charitable association and a third from a nursing home.  Khaswan’s relationship with Palestine’s armed groups came down to living in the apartment unit right above Tariq Ibrahim Ezzedin, one of three leaders of Palestinian Islamic Jihad against whose homes Israel’s military aviation launched a missile in a series of synchronized selective assassinations, triggering a new escalation of violence and five days of fighting that ended this past Saturday with a ceasefire after 33 deaths in Gaza and two in Israel.  One of the homes targeted by Israeli aviation in Gaza City. Antonio Pita  It was 2:00 a.m. when the ceiling collapsed on the bed in which Jamal and his wife, Mervat, were sleeping. Both died, as did their 20-year-old son Yousef, who was sleeping in an adjoining room. Another son, Yasem, who is five years younger, did not find out until the next day, at the hospital, that he had lost three members of his family. The youngest child, a nine-year-old girl, still believes that her parents and one of her brothers “are traveling,” explains Musa Saber Khaswan, Jamal’s brother. They are three of the 14 civilians whose lives were claimed by Israel’s Operation Shield and Arrow, defined this Sunday by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as “perfect” for having killed ”dozens of terrorists” — including six leaders of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad — and doing so “with total surprise and continuing initiative.”  “I was sleeping and suddenly things fell on my bed. It took me a few minutes to react,” Yasem, who a visible limp from the injuries caused by the falling debris, explains about the moment the missile hit the house. “We live in Gaza and we know that it is a dangerous place, but we never thought it could happen to us, because we know that my family is not a target for Israel,” he says with an absent look in his eyes.  Jamal Khaswan, 53, was a respected figure in Gaza, says his brother Musa Saber, who is four years older. In the 1990s, he studied dentistry and earned a doctoral degree in Russia, and had dual nationality. He was part of the family business of dental prosthetics, which currently employs 10 people and has been run by Musa since his graduation from Tel Aviv University (back when studying in Israel was not a pipe dream for a resident of Gaza). All the children in the family have gone on to study dentistry at college.  Musa Saber Khaswan stands next to two posters paying tribute to his brother Jamal, one of the victims of Israeli airstrikes against Gaza. Antonio Pita  Musa had visited his brother, who also headed the Gaza Dental Association, shortly before the latter’s death. Two hours later, he received a call that the building had been bombed. “It’s a good neighborhood. No one had moved away, no one expected anything to happen. If everyone in Gaza who has a neighbor from Hamas or from Islamic Jihad had to get out, the Israelis would have to start building lots of apartments for us,” he says ironically in one of the rare moments in which his voice does not tremble. “The pain of losing a brother is impossible to explain, but beyond that, the question is: why did he have to die? And I would say the same if I were a Jew or a Christian. And another question, how long will it go on like this?”  Three goals  The gaping holes in the buildings attest to the accuracy of both the impact (the buildings are still standing and, generally, with a single burnt-out apartment) and of Israel’s intelligence information regarding the location of the targets. The missiles were launched at dawn against three bedrooms in three different houses where the leaders of Palestinian Islamic Jihad were resting with their wives and children. Of the 13 deaths caused by that first wave of selective assassinations, on May 9, there were 10 civilians. One of them was five-year-old Hajar, who had snuggled in with her parents in their bed. Her father was Jalil Bahitini, a top commander of the Islamic Jihad.  Another daughter, 10-year-old Nada, has a black eye. That night, she was sleeping on the couch in the family home, just a few meters from the room where the projectile hit. At first, she says, she thought it was a dream. Then she saw a small fire. “I started screaming and realized that no one could hear me because I was under rubble,” she recalls, standing next to her sister Sara, 14. “I was expecting that something might happen to my father. At first, they told me that he had died, but that my mother and sister were only injured,” says Nada, before a lump in her throat prevents her from speaking further.  “My father used to tell us: ‘I could die at any moment,’” says his son Abdelaziz, 17, who was sleeping on the top floor of the two that make up the family home. “Yes, we were worried about him, because we knew he was part of the resistance and because what he said was true. But we thought it could happen in the middle of the street, or in a training field. What I could not imagine is that they would also take my mother and my sister,” he says, standing under the funeral tent where the Islamic Jihad is honoring his father.

Antonio Pita  Considered a terrorist group by Israel, the United States and the European Union, the Islamic Jihad — which depends on Iran for weapons and financing — is not very large, but it is particularly combative and Islamist, which is evident in the staging of the tributes to their deceased commanders. There are only men inside the tents, and the dead wives do not typically appear on the posters. The images of their dead leader Tariq Ibrahim Ezzedin extol the warrior in fatigues with the Temple Mount in the background, rather than the father in civilian clothes standing next to his two deceased sons: Ali, eight, and Miar, 12."

The violence that went on for at least 72 hours saw mob attacks on General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, Core Commander house in Lahore, Jinnah House Lahore, Radio Pakistan’s Peshawar office, and other government and state institution offices and buildings across the country.  The chaos targeted at state institutions, and the anger among Imran Khan’s supporters against the military, has now been linked to the former premier’s anti-military stance, open accusation and name calling of senior serving military officials of being behind attempts of assassination on his life.  The Pakistan Army has now decided to show zero tolerance against elements behind these attacks, terming them as a blatant attempt to not only target the institution but also to create a division between the people and the army.  During a special session of the Core Commanders Conference held at GHQ Rawalpindi, Chief of Army Staff General Syed Asim Munir was given a comprehensive briefing about incidents of violence and mob attacks on 9th May onwards as commanders expressed their anguish over the condemnable incidents.  The Core Commanders Conference mutually agreed to not show any restraint if such an attempts like that of 9th May are repeated in the future.  It also decided to show zero tolerance against all culprits behind the attacks, which the armed forces termed as “foreign supported and internally instigated, promoted and provoked against military installations and public/private properties”.  The army, without naming Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and its chief Imran Khan, has hinted towards arresting all of its supporters, instigated and provoked by him, which has lead to the attacks against the military installations, and initiating trial against them under the anti-terrorism laws of the country.  The army has also decided to initiate the Army Act and the Official Secret Act in some cases as well going forward.  It claimed that it has irrefutable evidence to establish that the attacks were part of a pre-planned strategy, implemented immediately after Khan’s arrest.  “The forum was briefed that a well coordinated arson plan involving desecration of Shuhada pictures, monuments, burning down of historical buildings and vandalism of military installations was executed to malign the institution and provoke it towards giving an impulsive reaction,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement.  “These attacks and attempts were made to create distortions in this regard are absolutely futile,” the ISPR added.  It is a known fact that Imran Khan has been very vocal about naming and shaming the army chief as well as other senior serving army and intelligence officials.  In his statement on May 9 before leaving for Islamabad from his Zaman Park residence in Lahore, he had lashed out at the military establishment yet again warning them of being ready for the consequences if any attempts to arrest him are made.  Now, with the army geared up to not spare the narrative and respond it with legal cases, Imran Khan’s coming days may just be numbered and he may be booked and trialed under the same references.  Under any of the references, if a case against Imran Khan is lodged and he is put to trial under any of the Acts, he may face life imprisonment or capital punishment. IANS"

He’s stepping into an important role: In addition to being a leading classical company that’s toured worldwide, DTH has had a significant impact on the field of dance and the larger American cultural landscape.  Arthur Mitchell created Dance Theatre of Harlem in New York City in 1969. Mitchell had made history as the first Black principal dancer at New York City Ballet, where he danced from 1956–69, with Balanchine creating ballets on him, notably roles in Agon and A Midsummer Night’s Dream. When Mitchell heard of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on the radio while in Brazil in 1968, he decided to return home to start a dance school in Harlem. He enlisted the mentorship of Balanchine and the partnership of dance teacher Karel Shook.  Mitchell started the DTH School in a converted garage in Harlem, followed by the touring company, of which Virginia Johnson was a founding member. Mitchell created a haven for dancers of all colors who craved training, performance experience, and an opportunity to excel in classical ballet.  Though DTH began touring in 1969, it had its official New York City debut in 1971 at the Guggenheim Museum, with chamber ballets choreographed by Mitchell. With Mitchell’s­ vision,­ the guidance of Balanchine, who gave Mitchell­ access­ and rights to perform his ballets, and the partnership of Shook, the foundation of the company was laid. In addition to commis­sion­ing works from Black choreographers (he named Robert Garland as DTH’s first resident choreographer in 1995), Mitchell­ updated classical ballets, such as with Creole Giselle, staged by Frederic Franklin and set in 19th-century­ Louisiana, and John Taras’ Firebird, set in a lush jungle.  In its more than 50-year history, DTH has received international acclaim, performing in 44 states, 250 cities in North America, and in 40 countries on 6 continents. DTH’s pioneering efforts to integrate stages and spread the art of ballet through outreach programs at home and abroad made it a beacon for Black dancers worldwide. In 2004, the company went on hiatus because of financial challenges, and in 2009, Mitchell asked Johnson to bring the company back. Over the past 13 years, Johnson has led the company’s renaissance.  Watching DTH today, the impact of this trailblazing organization is clear. From its diverse international dancers to the dynamic classical and contemporary repertory, the many stars who began their careers with DTH now dancing in ballet companies around the world, and its reemergence in the global ballet scene, the company reflects today what Johnson exalts as “the prevailing sense of self-affirmation behind DTH” that was integral to Mitchell’s vision.  The impact of Dance Theatre of Harlem extends far beyond the stage. The company represents the amalgamation of culture present in evolving art forms and what it looks like when the reality of a diverse country is in fact exalted in its most expressive art form. Art, like that of DTH, is indeed the resistance to the facade of elitism representing only a portion of the population and culture. As Virginia Johnson passes the torch to Robert Garland to become the third artistic director in the company’s 54-year history, she leaves the organization poised to expand upon Arthur Mitchell’s extraordinary vision."

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak greeted Zelenskyy with a handshake and hug after the president's helicopter landed at Chequers, the British leader's official country retreat. It was Zelenskyy's second trip to the U.K. since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, and the fifth European country he's visited in three days.  He is seeking more military aid as Ukraine prepares a long-anticipated spring offensive to retake Russian-occupied territory. The Ukrainian leader also visited Italy, the Vatican, Germany and France.  Russia reacted to the U.K.'s new pledge ""extremely negatively,"" but also doubts that the missiles and drones would drastically change the course of the war, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday.  ""Britain aspires to be at the forefront among countries that continue to pump weapons into Ukraine,"" Peskov said. ""We repeat once again: It cannot yield any drastic and fundamental influence on the way the special military operation (in Ukraine) is unfolding. But definitely it leads to further destruction. ... It makes this whole story for Ukraine much more complicated.""  Zelenskyy said one of the missions of his European travels that started Saturday was to build a ""fighter jet coalition"" to provide Ukraine with vital military power in the air. He said more work was needed on that front.  While the U.K. will not provide the planes, the prime minister said the country would join the coalition and begin a previously announced training program for Ukrainian fighter pilots as soon as this summer.  The U.K., one of Ukraine's major military allies, has provided short-range missiles, Challenger tanks and trained 15,000 Ukrainian troops on British soil. Last week, the government announced it had sent Ukraine Storm Shadow cruise missiles, which have a range of more than 150 miles. The British missiles were the first known shipment of longer-range weaponry that Kyiv has long sought from its allies.  Sunak's office said it was giving Ukraine hundreds more air defense missiles, as well as ""long-range attack drones"" with a reach of more than 120 miles.  ""This is a crucial moment in Ukraine's resistance to a terrible war of aggression they did not choose or provoke,"" Sunak said. ""They need the sustained support of the international community to defend against the barrage of unrelenting and indiscriminate attacks that have been their daily reality for over a year.  ""We must not let them down,"" the prime minister added.  Sunak plans to push allies at a meeting of the Group of Seven leaders in Japan later this week to deliver more support to Ukraine, his representative said.  As Zelenskyy visited European capitals, Russia increased its attacks across Ukraine with drones and missiles. Russia shelled two communities Sunday in the northern border province of Sumy, regional officials said on Telegram. They said 109 explosions were recorded.  Zelenskyy's office said Monday that Russian attacks had killed nine civilians and injured 19 in the past day. Six of the deaths were in southern Ukraine's Kherson province. Two civilians were killed in Chuhuiv in Kharkiv province, and one in Prymorsk, on the Azov Sea coast about 12 miles from Russian-occupied Berdyansk.  The presidential office also reported that Marhanets, which lies across the river from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, was shelled.  Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti reported that an acting regional interior minister appointed by Moscow, Igor Kornet, was injured in an explosion at a barbershop in the Russian-occupied city of Luhansk. The leader of the Luhansk People's Republic, a separatist-held region of Ukraine that Moscow illegally annexed, was quoted as saying a bomb caused the explosion.  Assassination attempts and sabotage attacks have increased in Russian-occupied territory as well as Russia proper. Russian authorities often blame Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv rarely acknowledges such attacks.  Zelenskyy traveled to Britain from Paris, where he met Sunday with French President Emmanuel Macron and secured a pledge of light tanks, armored vehicles and air defense systems.      About 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers will receive training in France this year and nearly 4,000 others in Poland, Macron's office said.  Speaking Monday on the French television network TF1, Macron said training on French fighter jets such as the Mirage 2000 ""can start now"" but rejected the idea of France delivering warplanes to Ukraine.  Zelenskyy also met with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Sunday. It was his first visit to Berlin since the start of the invasion and came a day after the German government announced military aid for Ukraine worth more than $3 billion.  Modern Western hardware is considered crucial if Ukraine is to succeed in its planned counteroffensive. During his European trip, Zelenskyy said Ukraine would aim to liberate Russian-occupied areas within Ukraine's internationally recognized borders and would not attack Russian territory.  Among areas Russia still occupies are the Crimean Peninsula and parts of eastern Ukraine with mainly Russian-speaking populations."

The scapular represents the filial piety of Catholics who have entrusted themselves to the protection of Our Lady — it is a sign of receiving Mary as a mother, and asking for her intercessory prayers.  It became a popular devotion beyond the Carmelites in the 16th and 17th centuries, and remains one today — and it probably helped that Pope John Paul was devoted to the scapular sacramental, reportedly asking in 1981, after an assassination attempt, that doctors leave his scapular around his neck while they operated on his body.  Of course, there are people who criticize the scapular as a kind of talismanic devotion — taking the so-called scapular promise (“whoever dies clothed in this scapular shall not suffer the fires of hell”) literalistically, instead of understanding it as a way of talking about persevering in the spiritual life.  It would be a mistake to imagine that one can die very far from God, in a pile of sin and depravity, and be taken up to heaven because one has worn the right wool squares around one’s neck. But I don’t know too many people who actually think that’s what their scapular is about.  Taken properly, as a sign of consecration to Christ through the maternal intercession of the Blessed Mother, the scapular can be a physical sign of the way in which, as John Paul II put it, “devotion to [Mary] cannot be limited to prayers and tributes in her honor on certain occasions, but must become a ‘habit,’ that is, a permanent orientation of one's own Christian conduct, woven of prayer and interior life, through frequent reception of the sacraments and the concrete practice of the spiritual and corporal works of mercy.”  JPII added: “In this way the scapular becomes a sign of the ‘covenant’ and reciprocal communion between Mary and the faithful: indeed, it concretely translates the gift of his Mother, which Jesus gave on the Cross to John and, through him, to all of us, and the entrustment of the beloved Apostle and of us to her, who became our spiritual mother.""  Whether you’re a scapular wearer or not, let the feast of St. Simon Stock remind us to make our devotion to Mary a “habit,” a “permanent orientation of … Christian conduct,” through the sacraments and the works of mercy.  St. Simon Stock, pray for us.  Subscribe now  The news  The bishops of France announced May 5 a kind of clerical ID card for bishops, priests, and deacons in the country, which replaces the customary celebret, and which includes a QR code, linking to a website which gives (reportedly) updated information on whether the cleric has faculties, and whether he labors under any ecclesiastical sanctions or ministerial restrictions.  Bishop Jean-Marc Eychenne of Grenoble-Vienne, France, shows his identity card. Screenshot from Église catholique en France YouTube account.  The ID card system has gotten some pushback in France, with some victim advocacy groups calling it a publicity stunt, and saying that it’s been rolled out in place of more systematic safeguarding policies needed in France.  I don’t know about all that.  But I do know that in the U.S., there exists a cumbersome, time-consuming, and expensive (in terms of personnel) back-and-forth process between dioceses for checking to see whether a cleric is a priest in good standing, who has faculties, and who has completed the safe environment trainings and background checks required for ministry.  When priests go out of town for weddings, retreats, vacations, or to fill in for a friend, there is a lot of paperwork going on between curias to make sure things are in order. A digitized system that would simplify that process would save priests a lot of headaches, and save chanceries a lot of time and money.  Of course, much like the current “letter of suitability” system, the digital ID card system is only as good as its users — if chanceries weren’t honest about a priest’s status, the card system wouldn’t fix that. And if chanceries didn’t update statuses in their databases, well, the card system wouldn’t be especially useful. But there are “user error” problems with the current approach as well, and sometimes they’re caused by the sheer volume of letters being handled in a vicar for clergy’s office — a volume that would be considerably reduced by this system.  It would be foolish to think that this system could replace other needed safeguarding reforms — as the victims’ advocates in France pointed out. But while it can’t solve all problems, it could solve some problems — and I know a lot of clerics hoping the bishops of the U.S. will take up a similar system soon.  Read all about France’s efforts, right here.  —  While the German “synodal way” formally concluded back in March, the powerful lay Central Committee of German Catholics says its battle to change the Church in Germany is just getting started.  “We are witnessing in recent weeks a Church in which leading men are cementing their power, refusing developments, and further deepening the rifts between the Church and the world,” the Zdk’s Irme Stetter-Karp said earlier this month, complaining about the Vatican’s refusal to endorse a resolution calling for lay preaching at Masses.  “I am angry and shocked,” Stetter-Karp declared. “But today more than ever it is clear: This Church as an absolutist system of power must come to an end.”  In an analysis last week, Luke Coppen broke down the ZdK’s efforts to obtain a permanent share of decision-making power within the Catholic Church in Germany — and its escalation of confrontational rhetoric after the Vatican didn’t endorse synodal way proposals.  Interesting, of course, is that German bishops have to date seemed to fall into line with whatever Stetter-Karp pushes for in Germany. But as they’re forced into a corner, it’s not clear they’ll continue “accompanying” the ZdK — and their pushback would mark a major sea change for ecclesiastical dynamics in Germany.  Read all about that, right here.  —  The Vatican City State got on a Saturday a new constitution, promulgated by Pope Francis, and making a number of interesting reforms. Most headlines about the new law have focused on the fact that lay people can now serve on the city-state's governing commission.  But most striking at The Pillar is that the new constitution talks about the exercise of authority in a very unusual way — removing all references to ordinary governance power, and focusing on governance “functions,” exercised in cooperation with the pontiff.  That might seem like pedantic semantics.  But amid a major Vatican debate about lay people and the “power of governance” in the Church, this revised rhetoric in the fundamental law of Vatican City is a big deal. But — what exactly does it mean?  In an incisive analysis, Ed Condon breaks things down. And he says it may be too soon to tell what the Vatican is working at here — but it’s something worth noting.  Read about a big, and cryptic, change, coming amid a ferocious debate about holy orders and governance.  —  Pope Francis has told journalists in recent months that he’s hoping to go to his native Argentina next year.  In 10 years of papacy, the pontiff has not yet been home to his country — and the reasons why are pretty complicated, actually. And, in fact, 2024 isn’t chosen at random: there’s a pretty good set of reasons why that might be the most sensible year for the pope to return home.  But to understand much of that, you’ve got to understand something about Argentine politics, and the pope’s long-standing tensions with various politicians, of various parties.  So our Latin American correspondent, Edgar Beltran, took a very deep dive into some of Francis’ history in Argentina — talking with a number of experts on the subject — to explain why the pontiff has delayed his homecoming.  This is a history of Francis with which you might not be especially familiar. And you should read it, because you’ll probably learn something. I learned a lot.  Give a gift subscription  —  We reported on Friday that the Vatican will ask Bishop Rick Stika to resign as Bishop of Knoxville, after more than two years of scandal over the bishop’s leadership of his eastern Tennessee diocese.  Sources close to the Dicastery for Bishops confirmed that Pope Francis decided last month to request Stika’s resignation, after reviewing the results of a Vatican-ordered investigation into the bishop’s management.  Of course, the Knoxville diocese has not commented on our reporting, and it remains to be seen whether Stika will actually tender his resignation. If he doesn’t, it could take some time for a difficult situation in Tennessee to resolve. But our reporting indicates that a long saga in the diocese is coming to its end game.  My suspicion is that Bishop Mark Spalding of Nashville will be appointed to temporarily lead the diocese if, and when, Stika makes his exit.  Things aren’t over in Knoxville, but this is a very serious development in a story we’ve covered now for more than two years.  And, if you’ve forgotten how exactly it started, you can read our lengthy May 2021 profile of Stika — which gives a rather comprehensive view of the man himself, even while we’ve uncovered considerably more about his leadership since its publication.  Leave a comment  Did +Strickland do a schism?  Bishop Joseph Strickland of Tyler, Texas, attracted some attention this weekend, when on Friday night he tweeted that “I believe Pope Francis is the Pope but it is time for me to say that I reject his program of undermining the Deposit of Faith.”  There is a backstory to the tweet, which involves Strickland signing on to participate as a lecturer in a kind of online course organized by a sedevacantist named Patrick Coffin, and then pulling out once he learned it was a sedevacantist affair.  But the backstory isn’t important right now, or at all, actually.  To many people, though, it does seem important that a sitting diocesan bishop accused the pope of advancing a “program undermining the Deposit of Faith.”  The “deposit of faith” constitutes the whole of sacred revelation, as contained in Sacred Scripture and Sacred Tradition, to be interpreted by the Church’s magisterium — so it’s no small potatoes for a sitting diocesan bishop to say the pope opposes that sacred deposit.  I was reminded by the tweet, to be honest, of some of the more fiery columns written decades ago by Milwaukee’s Archbishop Rembert Weakland in opposition to Pope St. John Paul II’s Curia, with whom Weakland disagreed on just about everything.  I don’t think +Strickland would appreciate being compared to +Weakland, but I can’t think of another American bishop who has so openly and directly expressed such vehement opposition to a pope’s leadership in a public context.  Now, let’s be real for a minute, OK? Really real.  There are a lot of Catholics, bishops among them, who think that Pope Francis’ approach to governance and teaching in the life of the Church is counterproductive, theologically flawed, or inimical to the flourishing of the Gospel. There were a lot of Catholics, bishops among them, who thought that about JPII or Benedict XVI’s leadership, or about that of Paul VI and John XXIII before them.  The pope is a sign and agent of unity in the Church, but he fosters that unity through faith, sacraments, and governance, not his own personal priorities or opinions.  This is a big Church, and we’re not all going to agree — so it shouldn’t be a source of scandal that some bishops think the Church’s pastoral life should be going in a very different direction than the pope is taking it. Especially in the modern era, when the personality of the pope looms so large, and seems to shape an office which once dwarfed its occupants, it can hardly be a surprise that a cadre of bishops disagree with the rhetoric, policies, or priorities of the Roman Pontiff. There’s no sin in that, so far as I can tell.  And there are probably a fair number of bishops today who basically agree with what Strickland had to say, even if they think he said it inelegantly, at best.  But a bishop has the responsibility of both leading his own people, and of building up unity in the life of the entire Church — of encouraging filial piety toward the pope as a universal shepherd and the principle of unity, and of encouraging obedience to him.  A bishop also has a responsibility to assure Catholics of the unique charism of the pope to teach, and of the Lord’s promise to protect the Church from error or apostasy, even if not to protect the Church from the imprudent choices of her leaders, or of the consequences of those choices.  While Strickland didn’t expressly encourage disobedience to the pope, you’d be hard-pressed to argue that language about “rejecting” and “undermining” is going to help Catholics who feel discouraged or confused at the moment to find their footing — or remind them about the charismatic infallibility of the papacy which acts as a kind of safeguard for the deposit of faith itself.  In that sense, it is a scandal if a sitting diocesan bishop made it harder for Catholics to find the proper disposition at a difficult moment in the Church’s life, or if he enflamed the passions of Catholics, undermining their ability to accept the primacy of the pope as an article of both faith and practice.  Now, the bishop might say there’s a reason for his rhetoric. I asked him for an interview on Monday to explain himself, but he declined to give that interview — so we’re left without his elaboration.  I have noted before that Strickland seems to speak before he thinks at crucial moments, and that while he’s sometimes revered as a straight-shooting hero, there are consequences to that kind of thing, and they often lead to confusion.  Still, while I’ve seen commentators and reporters suggest that Strickland’s tweet on Friday constitutes a kind of schism, I don’t think that’s so.  Schism is the “refusal of submission to the Roman Pontiff, or of communion with the members of the Church subject to him.”  It generally means a formal act of rejection - excluding the pontiff from the Eucharistic prayer, for example - or an act of disobedience to an actual directive from the pope. So while people might argue Strickland is in the proximate occasion of schism, I can’t see how he’s actually committed the canonical crime.  There is another canonical crime, though, that might be applied to Strickland’s rhetoric:  Canon 1373 establishes that “a person who publicly incites hatred or animosity against the Apostolic See or the Ordinary because of some act of ecclesiastical office or duty, or who provokes disobedience against them, is to be punished by interdict or other just penalties.”  It could be plausibly argued, I think, that Strickland’s tweet might well provoke disobedience against the Apostolic See, given that it talks about a kind of rejection of the pope’s leadership — or suggests as much.  We discussed c. 1373 at The Pillar yesterday, with Ed of the opinion that the Holy See might very well sanction Strickland, in light of the canon, for the scandal of his tweet.  Ed argued that bishops have been removed for less — pointing out that the bishop of Arecibo, Puerto Rico, was removed from his office last year for, effectively, some disagreements with his brother Puerto Rican bishops.  But that bishop was reportedly removed after considerable lobbying by influential churchmen who didn’t like his influence on the Church in Puerto Rico. And I don’t think the Holy See will have much response to Strickland’s tweet.  In the first place, the Vatican is still enough of the old school that while a magazine or journal article might rank as important, a tweet seems to many officials like some ephemeral bit of noise on the internet, unimportant, because it’s not understood.  But more than that, Pope Francis’ approach to overt criticisms of his leadership — whether from left, right, or center, is to ignore them — to deprive his critics of the oxygen they’d gain from his attention. Whether a particular criticism is valid or not is immaterial to him — the pope has demonstrated that he prefers to freeze out his critics, as he’s done in Germany, rather than respond with defenses or overt sanctions.  While I am certain the Holy See will make life difficult for the bishop of Tyler, by a thousand kinds of administrative and bureaucratic coldness, I think Strickland was probably already on the list for that kind of treatment in Rome.  Furthermore, I don’t think there’s anyone to lobby for his removal, or for any kind of sanction against him, for that matter.  If the American churchmen influential in Rome are asked their opinions, I suspect they’ll say they see Strickland’s rhetoric as a problem. But I don’t think they’ll stick their necks out too far over the issue.  I suspect those influential American churchmen in Rome realize they only have so much political capital for these kinds of things, and they don’t perceive Strickland as a major obstacle to achieving their goals for the life of the Church.  They might be bothered by his impertinence, sure, but I don’t think anyone in ecclesiastical leadership takes him seriously enough to push to get this on the pontiff’s desk.  In the Church, there is a certain kind of latitude extended to people perceived as harmless-seeming zealots, especially if they lack very much influence on their brother bishops. I suspect that’s how Strickland will be perceived in Rome, unless American cardinals push the issue.  In short, I’ll be very surprised if the pope makes any move regarding Strickland.  Again, I’m not saying I’ve got an opinion on what should be done about him — I know I’ll soon get emails about why my opinion is wrong on Strickland — it’s just my read of the situation itself.  Marshall Matters  In a surprise move last week, Catholic YouTube celebrity and internet provocateur Taylor Marshall announced that he was running for president.  Of the United States of America.  Now, in our little corner of the world, Marshall is not an unknown commodity. The guy has some half-a-million subscribers on YouTube, wrote a book hypothesizing about various infiltrations of the Vatican, developed a friendship with Archbishop Viganò, and paid the expenses of the guy who threw “the statue” in the River Tiber during the 2019 Amazon Synod.  He’s also the guy who said just a few months ago that the U.S. government is running an elaborate psyop on the American people to distract us from the possibility of demonic extraterrestrial aliens — or something very close to that.  Marshall is a former Anglican curate who became a Catholic, who once had a little apostolate selling catechetical materials, and whose messaging gradually became more provocative, and less connected to reality, as his YouTube audience grew.  He built an audience while rejecting at various times the legitimacy of the Church hierarchy and Vatican Council II, and, when the moment struck, allied himself with the political conspiracy theorism and biblically apocalyptic rhetoric surrounding the “Stop the Steal” movement.  He is, to my mind, best understood as a kind of religious entertainer, a performance artist, floating often outlandish conspiracy theories and provocative opinions, while managing to connect, in some down-to-earth way, to the real neuralgia about Church and state experienced by a real-life swath of Catholics.  He’s not unlike alt-right polemicist and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, actually — and as it happens, Marshall’s been interviewed as a Vatican “expert” on Jones’ Infowars.  If you’re not down with that kind of thing, let me say Marshall shouldn’t be written off entirely, because, the fact is, he has an audience, and makes a very nice living giving hot takes on the Church, selling books about freemasons and invented conspiracy theories, and portending some coming doom for America and the Church.  It is easy to make fun of Marshall’s schtick. But I think his audience deserves more careful consideration. They matter to me. They’re people who practice the faith, and have concerns and anxieties — people who went looking to make sense of things, and found this dude on YouTube promising he’s got all the answers.  That audience, by the way, exists in real life — when I speak at parishes, seminaries, or diocesan events, I’m often asked what I think of Marshall’s book, or encouraged to check out his YouTube channel — and often enough, by clerics.  And I promise you — this week we’ll see canceled subscriptions, and we’ll get nasty emails, from people who think I fail to appreciate Marshall’s prophetic genius.  While I don’t think Marshall evinces a firm or cogent grasp on issues in the Church, or talks about them sincerely or responsibly, his popularity says something about the unease many Catholics feel about the state of the Church, and about their place in a rapidly changing world — “not an epoch of change,” Pope Francis says, “but a change of epoch.”  And in a certain way, Marshall’s place in the U.S. Church is not all that unlike that of Fr. James Martin — and the popularity of both of those men is instructive.  Like Fr. Martin, the fact that Marshall has a (big) audience tells us some important things about what different swathes of Catholics value, what they fear, and what they’re looking for — even if both men take advantage of that audience, or exploit it to pursue their own (radically different) agendas.  Marshall’s popularity, like Martin’s, strikes me as a kind of funhouse mirror, through which something can be gleaned — with enough filters to straighten the image — about the state of the Church. And it seems to me we should be willing to look.  In fact, if we really want to learn what disenfranchised Catholics think about the Church, we might learn more from the comments in Taylor Marshall’s YouTube videos than we can from all the synods on synodality that every synoded synodally.  And I, for one, think that’s useful.  But Taylor Marshall is not a known commodity outside our small corner of the world.  And let’s just be clear about something.  Taylor Marshall is not going to be the president.  Taylor Marshall will not be president.  He won’t be.  I’m pretty sure that he doesn’t even want to be president.  With that out of the way, I should say that I’m an admirer of third parties and the role they play in American political life, and I think it can be perfectly legitimate to vote for them. I think democracies are healthier without a duopoly locked in enduring combat, when small parties can play key roles in forming coalition governments, and when new ideas have room to move forward.  I think the Democrats and Republicans have done well enough in this country at capturing the whole of our political imagination, and the perpetuity of binary power transfers, such that most of us believe there are only two meaningful options for voting.  The guidance of the Church affirms the legitimacy of choosing the candidate who you think would be the best, even if he won’t win — or even of not voting in a particular race. But when election year rolls around, I hear a lot of well-meaning Catholics say that anything but a vote for Candidate X is really a vote for Candidate Y — or vice versa.  We even hear that from a swath of well-meaning pulpits.  I don’t think the mathematical or moral assessment on that actually checks out, but you hear it in election years, pretty often — “If you don’t vote for Our Guy, you’re voting for the Other Guy. And the Other Guy is pure evil, so you’ve got to vote for Our Guy. And this is the most important election of our lifetime. Again.”  The Church teaches clearly that voting for certain candidates, with inhuman policy agendas, is morally abhorrent, or that one needs rather significant “proportionate reasons” to overcome the monstrosity of their agendas. And it teaches that when all candidates have morally abhorrent agendas, you can choose one who “deemed less likely to advance such a morally flawed position and more likely to pursue other authentic human goods.”  The Church doesn’t teach that if you don’t vote for one of the frontrunners, you’re somehow voting for the other frontrunner. But come election time, you’ll hear a lot of that, with fervent conviction, from lots of Catholics.  And, in fact, in elections past, it was the kind of the thing you’d hear from Marshall’s audience, or from the man himself, as when, for example, he served in 2020 as a prominent member of Catholics for Trump.  So I’m interested to see whether Marshall’s presence as a “candidate” — he is not, as of yet, among the 727 Americans who have filed paperwork with the Federal Elections Commission declaring their candidacy for president — will change that discussion for some Catholics.  Of course, I can’t speculate about why Marshall is running for president. Or, I can, but it wouldn’t be charitable.  But I will say, sincerely, that if the candidacy of a polemicist YouTuber and “Infiltration” expert opens up discussion about breaking free from a consequentialist moral calculus, one mandating people vote for a candidate they just can’t stomach — well, I’m glad for the conversation, at least.  And did you know that 727 Americans have filed paperwork to declare themselves candidates for 2024?  This is one hell of a country, guys.  Subscribe now  It’s not the celibacy  Finally, we covered last week the scandal of Fr. Alfonso Pedrajas, a Spanish Jesuit who served in Bolivia, and whose posthumously discovered journals revealed that he had committed serial abuse of minors, and that his ecclesiastical superiors had seemingly covered it up.  Pedrajas’ journals are sobering and sickening reading, by any standard.  Well, as the Bolivian bishops respond to the scandal, one took to the radio last week, to say that as “changes have to be made,” one of them is for the Church to ordain married men to the priesthood.  According to Bolivian radio network Erbol, Bishop Eugenio Coter argued that allowing married men to be ordained priests could be part of the solution to the problem of sexual abuse in the Church, since, he reportedly argued, marriage helps a person to develop an integrated sexuality, and provides companionship.  Please allow me to editorialize for a moment: Bishop Coter seemingly has rather profoundly misunderstood the dynamics of pederastic and pedophilac child abuse in any context. Marriage would not stop pederastic child abusers from committing abuse. In fact, as data from other public institutions shows us repeatedly, it doesn’t. And indeed, the most typical place for a child to be abused is in his extended family or among family friends, most of whom are not likely celibate.  Of course, I’ve seen it argued that there is a greater likelihood that married men will have a mature, integrated, and chaste sexuality than celibate men. I don’t see any reason to think that’s true — in fact, I don’t think it’s true. But even if it were, allowing for the possibility of married men wouldn’t, by itself, screen out from the priesthood men with the propensity or disposition to be abusers. Better screening, scrutiny, evaluation, and formation processes would do that, with the knowledge that sacred ordination, or admission to religious life, shouldn’t be offered to everyone who seeks it.  It is a demeaning view of marriage — and of women — to suggest that if only priests could be married, abuse would not happen. There is no evidence to suggest this, as experts in abuse and safeguarding have often argued.  Clerical celibacy has a long and rich theological and spiritual history in the West. It is not absolute, of course — deacons can be married men, as can members of the Church’s Anglican ordinariate. But celibacy is a disciplinary, not a doctrinal matter, and the Church could allow for more married men to become priests in the West. Certainly, there are prelates who think that’s a good idea.  But whatever their reasons, the notion that ending clerical celibacy would eradicate abuse is a red herring. At least as far as I can tell — If you think otherwise, let me know in the comments. I’d be interested to read your view.

The observance will commence on May 29 and conclude on June 10. These programs were finalized during a joint meeting at the party's Naya Paltan central office yesterday, presided over by Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir.  Fakhrul announced a series of activities that will take place during this period. These activities include engaging in discussions, hosting seminars, organizing photo exhibitions, wearing black badges as a symbol of mourning for Zia, as well as distributing food and relief materials to the needy, according to a report by UNB.  As part of the commemoration, black flags will be raised and party flags will be lowered to half-mast at all party offices, including the Nayapaltan headquarters, at 6 am on May 30.  Ziaur Rahman gained prominence for his role in reading out the Declaration of Independence from Kalurghat Betar Kendra on March 27, 1971, and for his active participation in the war. Following liberation, he was appointed deputy chief of staff of the army. After the assassination of the Father of the Nation and President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on August 15, 1975, Zia assumed the position of army chief. In November of the year, following a series of coups and counter-coups, with President ASM Sayem as chief martial law administrator, Zia became one of the three deputy chief martial law administrators. He eventually became president of the country in April 1977 in succession to Justice ASM Sayem, who had become president in early November 1975.  In 1978, Zia founded the BNP and conducted parliamentary elections in 1979 to end martial law rule, which had imposed restrictions on political activities and freedom of the press.  General Zia was assassinated by a group of army officers in a putsch at the Chittagong Circuit House on May 30, 1981, where he had traveled from Dhaka to resolve a conflict within the party.  Following Zia's death, General HM Ershad, who had been appointed army chief by Zia, oversaw the process of a controversial military trial that resulted in the hanging of a dozen army officers on charges of conspiring to assassinate the president. Another courageous army officer, Maj Gen M Abul Manzur, who had knowledge of the conspiracy against Zia, was extrajudicially killed allegedly on Ershad's orders, with him being falsely accused of being behind the president's assassination.  Four days before the assassination, Ershad met with Lt Col Motiur Rahman at the Chittagong cantonment. Motiur shot the president, leading to his demise."

When I announced my decision not to run for office again, I cited the increased vitriol, hateful rhetoric, and lack of civility in our public discourse. It is hard to look at a situation such as today, or reflect on the events of Jan. 6, 2021, and not see some correlation between the divisive politics of hate which depersonalize our political foes into caricatures of villains and the acts of violence.  According to her Congressional Testimony on March 31, 2022, Rachel Kleinfeld, a Senior Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment, there was an acceleration of political violence between 2016 and 2020 and the level of acceptance and support for political violence has also increased by members of both political parties. Justifications are steeped in the importance of protecting the traditional American way of life, validity of elections, and other false or misleading narratives. Threats against members of Congress have almost doubled, and hate crimes are increasing, with rates higher in 2021 than in the year following 9/11.  More disturbing than even historic numbers is the broader base of individuals who are involved in these acts of aggression. Acts of aggression like what happened today at Connolly’s office are no longer contained to extremist groups, but have spread to lone actors reacting to the rhetoric they are hearing or seeing online, in public meetings and feeling compelled to take aggressive action.  We do not know the motivation of the intruder in Connolly’s office. There have been moments and periods of time, as an elected school board member, where I worried about my colleagues, our staff, and my own safety during official proceedings when emotionally charged issues came before the board.  We do know that each of us can do our part to mitigate these acts. Collectively, we must tone down the divisive rhetoric, vilifying name calling, and character assassination. The issues before our Federal, State legislatures, and local governments are too important to trivialize with destructive and non-productive behavior. We must focus on the issues before our policy making bodies that affect the everyday lives of our community members.  We can realize that there are policy areas where groups or individuals may align on individual issues and others where the makeup of a group supporting an issue may be different. However, this is only possible if the discourse focuses on the content of the policy issues and does not cast aspersions on the character of individuals in a group.  Together we can achieve the American dream of a more perfect union by reenforcing our foundations of civil discourse.

Guterres spoke after meeting behind closed doors with Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness in his first visit to the island, which comes more than three months after Holness announced that his government was willing to send soldiers and police officers to Haiti as part of a proposed international armed forces deployment.  Guterres noted that no other country has stepped forward despite the plea from Haiti’s prime minister and other top officials last October for the immediate deployment of an international force to fight a surge in gang violence.  “We are kind of in a stalemate right now,” he said, adding that it’s been difficult to mobilize the will of countries who could best lead such an operation.  Holness, who visited Haiti in February as part of a regional push to help mediate the country's crisis, said countries that would support such a deployment want to first see political consensus in Haiti and a timeframe for ending the proposed deployment.  “It is not that our pleas have fallen on deaf ears,” he said. “It is being heard to and listened to. The question is the pace of action.”  Haiti’s capital and surrounding areas have largely succumbed to warring gangs that have invaded neighborhoods and killed people in a fight to control more territory, with the U.N. estimating that they now control up to 80% of Port-au-Prince.  The violence has worsened since the July 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse. More than 840 people were killed in the first three months of this year, in addition to more than 600 people slain in the month of April alone, according to the U.N. More than 400 people also have been kidnapped so far this year.  “You have dramatic humanitarian needs. You have a political system that is paralyzed, and you have levels of violence by gangs that are absolutely appalling,” Guterres said.  He previously said that insecurity in Haiti had reached “levels comparable to countries in armed conflict.”  The deaths have prompted a growing number of angry and frustrated Haitians to unleash gruesome vigilante justice, lynching at least 164 alleged gang members last month, according to the U.N.  Frantz Elbé, director of Haiti’s National Police, said in a video posted on social media Saturday that officers are fighting gangs, seizing weapons and releasing hostages, but he did not provide any figures.  The U.N. has noted that just over 13,000 officers are on active duty in a country of more than 11 million people, with at least 21 police officers reported killed in the first three months of this year.  “I want to once again ask the international community to understand that an effective solidarity with Haiti is not only a matter of generosity,” Guterres said. “It’s essentially a matter of enlightened self-interest because the present situation in Haiti reflects a threat, a threat to the security of the whole region and further afield.”"

Justin Jones raises a fist to the legislative gallery, as fellow Rep. Justin Pearson, left, looks on. Seth Herald/Getty Images  Mississippi legislators have enacted a law that would create a new judicial system covering the state’s capital city, Jackson, in place of the current county court system.  Set to take effect July 1, 2023, the move by a Republican-dominated legislature has been criticized by opponents as creating a “separate and unequal” court system that is not answerable to the majority-Black community it would seek to govern.  The law was justified by supporters as an effort to curb the city’s crime level, which includes one of the highest murder rates in the nation. But the move is the second time in as many months that state legislatures have taken highly visible actions to effectively disenfranchise Black voters: On April 6, the Tennessee House of Representatives expelled two Black members who represented mostly Black districts.  As a sociologist who studies race and ethnicity, I have closely followed these moves by the states. Throughout U.S. history, I see three main periods of legislative disenfranchisement in which legislative bodies have voted to expel members. These events have been shown to be a form of “white backlash” working to keep Black officeholders out of power and their constituents powerless without representation.  Reconstruction and legislative disenfranchisement  After the Civil War, the United States engaged in a brief period known as Reconstruction, which lasted from 1865 to 1877. It was a deliberate attempt to reverse the negative effects and legacies of slavery by enacting economic, political and social policies that directly benefited the formerly enslaved Black people of the South.  The efforts included formally abolishing slavery nationwide, guaranteeing equal protection of the laws to everyone regardless of race, and allowing formerly enslaved people to vote. In addition, formerly Confederate land was set aside for newly freed Black families, and former Confederate soldiers were not allowed to vote.  But after Tennessee politician Andrew Johnson, who had been Abraham Lincoln’s running mate in 1864, took office upon Lincoln’s assassination, many of those provisions of Reconstruction were reversed. Former Confederate combatants were allowed to vote, and confiscated Confederate property was returned to its prewar owners.  Story continues  In addition, Johnson and Congress made it easier for defeated Confederate states to rejoin the Union, which allowed former Confederate leaders to regain their previous positions of power in local and national governments.  Georgia was originally readmitted to the Union in July 1868. But just two months later, in September, the Democratically controlled Georgia Assembly, with a total of 196 members, voted to expel all 33 of its Black elected officials.  Immediately upon making themselves into an all-white legislature, the remaining assembly members enacted the infamous Black Codes. These codes created a unique set of laws specific to the newly freed Blacks, including limiting the types of work they could do.  Collectively, the legislative expulsion of the Black officials and the imposition of the Black Codes served to effectively disenfranchise the Black voters of Georgia. Senator Henry McNeal Turner, one of those expelled, defiantly asked: “Am I a man? If I am such, I claim the rights of a man.”  Under the Black Codes, which were restrictive laws in the post-Reconstruction South, a Black person could be sold into what was effectively a new version of slavery if they could not repay fines or debts. Interim Archives/Getty Images  The civil rights era  Another major effort to disenfranchise Black Americans came during their next major push to achieve political, social and economic equality: the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s. Opponents targeted two prominent civil rights activists who had been elected to represent their communities: Adam Clayton Powell Jr. and Julian Bond.  Bond was elected as a Democrat to the Georgia House of Representatives in 1965, but on Jan. 10, 1966, the Democratically controlled House voted not to seat him, citing his criticism of U.S. involvement in Vietnam and support of students who were protesting the war. A year later, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Bond’s First Amendment rights had been violated and ordered that he be seated. But for that intervening year, his constituents had no voice in their state legislature. Bond ultimately served in the Georgia legislature for another two decades, before turning to teaching and activism.  Powell’s situation was different. He was the first African American to be elected to Congress from New York and from any state in the Northeast. Starting in 1945, he represented the district that included the majority-Black Harlem neighborhood of New York City. He became one of the most important Democrats in the House, but in the mid-1960s, he found himself embroiled in personal and financial scandals.  After the election of 1966, the House created a committee to investigate Powell’s actions and refused to seat him until the committee’s report was complete. The report found fault, but committee members were split on the proper discipline for Powell. Ultimately the whole House voted to keep him out.  Powell sued to reclaim his seat, saying the House had excluded him unconstitutionally. He also won the special election in April 1967 created by the vacancy but didn’t take his seat because of the lawsuit. The removal of Powell meant that Harlem was the only congressional district in the nation without a representative from 1967 to 1969.  In 1969, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the House had acted unconstitutionally by refusing to seat Powell. By then, Powell had also won the 1968 regularly scheduled election and had been seated, though without the seniority and committee positions that would normally have been given to someone who had continuously been a House member.  Black Lives Matter movement  In the aftermath of the George Floyd killing, a new social movement emerged across the United States. With this new activism came another “white backlash” in the form of legislative disenfranchisement.  In May 2022, Tiara Young Hudson, a long-serving Black public defender, won the Democratic primary for a judgeship in Jefferson County, Alabama. More than half of the county’s population is nonwhite. Facing no opposition in the general election, she was expected to win and take office.  But two weeks after the primary, a state judicial commission, divided along racial lines, eliminated the position she was a candidate for and created a new judgeship in the majority-white Madison County.  Hudson immediately sued to block the shift, saying it violated the Alabama Constitution and only the state legislature had the authority to reallocate judgeships. In March 2023, the state supreme court dismissed Hudson’s complaint, effectively stripping the Black people of Jefferson County of a representative they had elected to be their voice on the state’s roster of judges.  And on April 6, 2023, the Republican majority of the Tennessee House of Representatives voted to expel two Black legislators – Justin Pearson and Justin Jones – for participating in a protest calling for gun legislation following yet another mass shooting.  Within days, both Pearson and Jones had been temporarily reinstated by processes for filling vacant seats, but still face special elections to fully reclaim their seats. Their alleged violation was participating in a protest against the legislature’s rules – but their real violation, I believe, was that they were Black, outspoken and pushed for change.

The State is churning out statements and proposing ways and means of teaching a lesson to the opposition and its supporters in the public. Taking the cue, much is being written in print and electronic media to further suggest ways to suppress opposition and any dissenting voices, even if they are of the ordinary public. However, beating the drums of war, the politicians are not realizing that their words and actions may later come back to haunt them.  Hundreds of opposition activists have been arrested along with their first and second-tier leadership by the state, which is simply unprecedented in the recent political history of Pakistan. However, would such violent actions of arbitrary arrests, and baton charging, and tear gassing the protestors help to ease the charged atmosphere in the country? Similarly, houses of opposition leaders are being raided, thus setting another dangerous precedent in politics. Also, protesting families are manhandled in front of cameras with impunity, without realizing that local media may be influenced but not the foreign media which is continuously beaming ground realities to the international viewers.  Further, taking the State’s cue and molding public opinion, ideas are being floated in the print and media to repress the opposition—an essential ingredient of democracy. It has been suggested to set up ‘rioter courts’ to punish the rioters, giving the example of the UK, which is the cradle of democracy and citizens’ rights are jealously guarded and the judiciary is independent and impermeable to any influence-hostile or condescending. To try the demonstrators, words like ‘terrorism’ and ‘terrorists’ are being thrown around like spaghetti, and everything is being painted as black or white: you are either with us or against us. In the UK, judges of the ‘rioter courts’ handed sentences for vandalism, theft and arson only upon the provision of solid evidence provided by the law enforcement agencies, not at the whims and egos of a few. Similarly, it is being suggested to conduct trials by army courts. Such undemocratic steps would only weaken the institutions and democracy.  Among the political parties, PPP and its workers have suffered the most for democracy: the execution of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, the assassination of Benazir Bhutto (BB), the incarceration of former Pres Zardari and the flogging of PPP activists. BB was subjected to misogynistic slurs and faced a slew of cases. There are still iconic pictures of BB visiting her incarcerated husband with young children in tow. Therefore, PPP was always at the forefront to save democracy and give space to opposition. However, the torch of leadership has passed to a new generation: which, probably, has neither the experience nor memories of past political victimization, because of this no fire control measures are being initiated by the most mature political party in Pakistan.  There is a general glee over the victimization and abuse of the protesting public. However, keeping in view the political history of Pakistan, what goes around, comes around. Therefore, the petty and brutal tactics might come back to haunt everyone. The egos of a few have put the entire country in a spin and suddenly personal vendettas over the country’s interests have taken center stage. Political parties have probably forgotten the slogan: Democracy is the best revenge. So let sanity and saner minds prevail, lest everybody will lose what was hard won by BB—democracy."

In an interview with Israel's Channel 14, Netanyahu said Israel conveyed a message not only to terror factions in Gaza but also to those in other hostile countries.  “We have changed the deterrence equation,” he said. “I cannot say that we will never return to attacks nor when exactly that will happen, but there is no doubt that we have strengthened Israeli deterrence.”  “We have dealt an extremely powerful blow to the Islamic Jihad and I estimate that this was registered properly,” he continued.  “And it was not only registered with them, it was registered with others. Anyone that has eyes understood that Israel is not ready to tolerate attacks on its citizens, its soldiers, and its cities, and that we will take direct and very painful measures against those who direct the fire and those who send the terror,” referring to Iran.  Shortly after Israel launched its campaign against PIJ, a senior Israeli official told i24NEWS that Iran was “directing” actions in Gaza to inflame tensions.  In response to a question about targeted assassinations, Netanyahu said: “We carry out assassinations in other arenas, but I can’t go into detail. We've raised it to a higher level – first of all, we did it out of calmness, and we did it with wholesale targeted assassinations. This changes the balance of deterrence in the region.""

The monument by Spanish sculptor Mariano Benlliure shares space in the hall that celebrates the two greatest Filipino painters of the 19th century because they were classmates at the Spanish Academy in Rome. All three were awarded medals in the 1884 Exposición Nacional de Bellas Artes in Madrid: Luna, First Class or Gold medal for “Spoliarium”; Resurreccion Hidalgo, Second Class or Silver Medal for “Jovenes cristianas expuestas al populacho” (Christian maidens exposed to the mob); Benlliure, Second Class (Silver) medal for “Accidente.”  ADVERTISEMENT  These medals placed Luna and Hidalgo, indios from Filipinas, at par with or even greater than their Spanish peers. They had become world-class. Then as now, we take pride in Luna and Hidalgo in the same way that we share in Lea Salonga’s triumph on the West End and Broadway, Manny Pacquiao’s conquest of world boxing, and, last but not least, weightlifter Hidilyn Diaz bringing home the first Olympic gold to a proud and grateful nation. They made us proud.A photograph taken in Rome, circa 1881, shows Juan Luna, Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo, Miguel Zaragoza, and Pedro Alejandro Paterno with the Benlliure brothers Mariano and Juan of Valencia, Spain. Who would have known these art students would later become famous? Not in the photo is Jose Benlliure who made a copy of Luna’s “Spoliarium” that used to hang in the prewar National Museum before it was destroyed in the 1945 Battle for Manila. The Fergusson monument is one of only three known works by Benlliure in the Philippines today. The other two are a portrait of Juan Luna in the University of Santo Tomas Museum and a portrait of Pedro Paterno in a private collection.  After four months at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, I look at Fergusson differently, in the context of the ongoing revision of museum and library records and catalog entries that situate the past in political correctness. Any and all racist or derogatory language is deleted or reworded. Deirdre de la Cruz and Ricky Punzalan co-direct the Recollect-Reconnect project that seeks to decolonize the University of Michigan Philippine collections to bring out their true worth.  Fergusson was said to have died of a heart attack while walking home from his office in the Ayuntamiento in Intramuros to the suburb of San Miguel on Jan. 30, 1908. As a testament to their loss, Fergusson Memorial Association commissioned the Benlliure monument that was completed in Spain in 1912 and shipped to Manila for its unveiling on Nov. 15, 1913. If you go around the monument, you will find a lot of pockmarks left by bullets and shelling during the 1945 Battle for Manila. My friend Tina Cuyugan related that when her father and uncles were boys, they created a small bomb from toy gun gunpowder and exploded it on the monument one night in 1920. Their homemade bomb is supposed to have blasted away one of Fergusson’s ears. Since Fergusson’s ears are intact, I presume it must have been restored or the boys over-imagined the damage they caused.  The decolonization of Plaza Fergusson came about when the City of Manila commissioned an atrocious image of the Virgin of Ermita (Nuestra Señora de Guia or Our Lady of Guidance) from the late Eduardo Castrillo. The plaza in front of Ermita Church was renamed in her honor. Fergusson was then given to the United States Embassy where it was preserved on the grounds facing Manila Bay until its loan, six years ago, to the National Museum. The plaza was further decolonized by being renamed Plaza Guerrero in honor of the poet Fernando Ma. Guerrero and by extension the other Guerrero writers from Ermita: National Artist Wilfrido Ma., diplomat Leon Ma., and essayist Carmen Guerrero Nakpil. Monuments are erected to boost memory, but when memories are conflicted, monuments with contested histories are removed or relocated just like Fergusson’s.

It was unclear for many years who had killed him, with the Official IRA initially blamed as well as false allegations he had been behind two murders.  His son Paul has emphasised the importance of clearing his father’s name both in a Historical Enquiries Team report and an acknowledgement by the UVF that their information had been flawed.  The UVF’s involvement became clear in 1977 when Raymond Glover, a man with UVF connections, confessed his involvement in the killing and was jailed.  The Crawford family went through an inquest, a criminal trial, a Police Ombudsman report and an HET report.  Advertisement  However, Mr Crawford’s son Paul said he secured the answers his family wanted by talking to the UVF via interlocuter Winston Irvine.  The process started in 2016, and Mr Crawford worked with Mr Irvine to ask questions and receive answers as well as verifying what he was told.  One of those questions was around the family’s long-held belief that there had been collusion in the killing.  The report from the UVF said there had not been collusion in terms of there having been no joint enterprise involving other groups or agencies.  However, they said they now accept that the information they acted on was flawed.  'A first' for loyalism  The process, described by Queen’s University academic Professor Kieran McEvoy as “a first” for loyalism, is the subject of a new report.  Professor McEvoy said the closest comparison to the process is the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims’ Remains (ICLVR), through which the IRA and INLA have provided information to help try to find the remains of the ‘disappeared’.  Mr Crawford said the process with the UVF delivered “absolutely full answers and full resolution of what I was seeking”.  “My father was an innocent man who was brutally murdered in a sectarian assassination for which no organisation ever claimed responsibility,” he said.  Advertisement  “My mother Eileen, now deceased, told journalists immediately after the murder in 1974, ‘we want to know who did this and why it should happen to him’. Like many families who lost loved ones, that has remained our quest in the ensuing five decades.”  Paul blasted the original investigation as “poor” and that the brief inquest in 1974 merely confirmed the cause of death.  “One man, James Glover, was convicted in 1978 of the murder after he was arrested for something else and confessed to being involved in my father’s killing and several others.  “However, because he pleaded guilty at trial there was no cross-examination and opportunity to learn anything further,” he said.  “A subsequent Police Ombudsman investigation, during the tenure of Al Hutchinson as ombudsman, was a complete waste of time.  Commissioner for Victims and Survivors Ian Jeffers at Queens University Belfast, following the launch of a report into the murder of John Crawford by the UVF in 1974. Photo: PA Images  “A Historical Enquiries Team report confirmed that my father was an innocent man but that determination was undermined by the fact that one of the original investigating RUC officers was dead and another refused to cooperate.  “After all of these processes, we still had many questions and I concluded that those questions could only be answered by the group responsible, the UVF.  “The process took a long time as it involved agreeing a set of ground rules, with me setting out clearly the information that I was seeking, including that I was not looking for the names of those involved, and then the information being relayed back and forward over many scores of meetings via the interlocutor.  “Ultimately, my family and I received answers to the questions we were seeking and a formal written acknowledgement of responsibility for the murder from the UVF.  “I do not believe in closure – my father was brutally and unjustifiably taken from us and that is a wound that will never heal – but as far as I am concerned this process has delivered absolutely full answers and full resolution of what I was seeking.”  Victims Commissioner Ian Jeffers commended what Mr Crawford has done as “tremendously brave”.  “From my point of view, it shows that with the right tenacity and the right approach you can get information – but the reality is leaving that up to the victim to do seems very, very cruel and that’s something we must address as a civil society,” he said."

Win McNamee/Getty Images  The Secret Service has launched an investigation into how a man was able to make his way into the Washington, D.C., home of President Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, without the agents on guard noticing, three government officials told The Washington Post.  The incident took place one night in late April, at about 3 a.m. After realizing the man was in his home, Sullivan approached him and told him to leave, two of the officials said. Sullivan has a round-the-clock Secret Service detail, but the agents weren't aware of the intruder until Sullivan went outside and notified them. By that time, the unknown man had left, two officials told the Post.  There were no signs of forced entry, the Post reported, and the intruder seemed to be intoxicated and confused about his whereabouts. The government officials said there is no evidence that the man knew Sullivan or wanted to hurt him. Under normal protocol, the intruder would have been detained by the Secret Service for questioning, and most likely arrested and charged with trespassing.  In a statement, Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the agency is ""taking this matter seriously"" and opened a ""comprehensive mission assurance investigation to review all facets of what occurred. Any deviation from our protective protocols is unacceptable and if discovered, personnel will be held accountable.""  National security advisers used to receive Secret Service protection only while traveling outside of Washington, D.C., a senior national security official told the Post, but after the FBI uncovered in 2021 an Iranian plot to assassinate John Bolton, a national security adviser under former President Donald Trump, the Secret Service added a heightened level of security for the position.

For the latest headlines, follow our Google News channel online or via the app.  Advertisement  “Those involved in these heinous crimes against the military installations and personal/equipment will be brought to justice through trials under relevant laws of Pakistan including Pakistan Army Act and Official Secret Act.”  The military’s sharp reaction marks another escalation in an ongoing showdown between Pakistan’s most powerful institution and Khan, who was arrested by an anti-graft agency and later released by the Supreme Court. His detention sparked widespread anger among his supporters and some groups breached the military headquarters while others set fire to a military commander’s official residence.  At least eight people were killed and scores more arrested, including close aides and political associates of Khan.  The increasingly public defiance against the military signals a shift in attitudes in Pakistan which has been directly ruled by the army for almost half of its history since its creation in 1947. Most prime ministers have depended on the institution’s support to stay in power, including Khan himself, but his ties worsened during his time in power.  Khan attempted to control military promotions, opposing the army chief at the time in an incident that sowed the seeds for his ouster in April last year. He accused the army of conspiring with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the US to oust him, which all three denied. But his campaign to turn public opinion against the military continued.  No direct reference was made to Khan in Monday’s statement but in the days leading to his arrest by paramilitary troops, the army criticized him for accusing the institution of being behind at least two assassination attempts, including a shooting incident in November. The military has consistently denied the allegations.  Khan’s party denied its supporters vandalized army property.  “We also believe that those involved in terrorism against the state must be punished but it is very important that they should be correctly identified,” Shafqat Mahmood, a senior leader in Khan’s Tehreek-e-Insaf party said by phone. “There were people in the crowd who were not our supporters.

Echoing the phrase from anti-Mafia activists in Italy and elsewhere, Zammit warned that unless people take action immediately the situation can only get worse.  “If you won’t listen to the shouts of the living, then you must listen to the screams of Daphne Caruana Galizia who was stalked, harassed, and vilified, before she was brutally assassinated because she knew too much,” she said.  “If you truly want justice for her stories, then why have you consistently failed to implement the recommendations of the inquiry?” Zammit asked in reference to the recommendations put forward by the public inquiry into the murder of the journalist.  She went on to ask why the authorities have so far failed to reopen the Egrant Inquiry as requested by Magistrate Ian Farrugia.  “Have you learnt nothing since Daphne’s assassination about the need to protect those who fight for truth and justice? To protect them from threats and physical harm? What are you waiting for? More deaths?” Zammit said in clear reference to Repubblika president Robert Aquilina’s recent request for protection.  In her speech, Zammit said that Malta is “a corrupt country, and a mafia state,” adding that people fall in three camps; those who endorse corruption, those who turn a blind eye to corruption, and those who actually see the full picture.  “However we’re all experiencing the full picture, whether we like it or not,” she said, as she warned that the end result of greed and corruption is more deaths caused by the unregulated construction industry and road accidents.  “The end result of living in a Mafia state means that shoddy unplanned construction will continue The end result of living in a Mafia State means that more people will die in traffic accidents because of badly planned roads or because of lack of enforcement of the law,” Zammit said.  “The end result of living in a Mafia state is more victims of domestic violence because our institutions can’t pull their fingers out of their collective backsides and protect women.”  ‘We will get there’ – Josef Lauri  Tonight’s vigil was also addressed by academic Josef Lauri who said Daphne Caruana Galizia’s assassination “was a result of a sense of impunity that we saw fostered among those who are surprised by corruption and in love with crime.”  He added that corruption contains the seeds of its own destruction and the system will eventually implode.  “This seed of destruction is growing into a tree. We must continue striving to ensure that we will be here to see the fruits of this tree.”  Lauri said that while people might not have the time and energy to be on the frontline in the fight against corruption, he said the last they can do is remind activists such as those form Repubblika and Occupy Justice, that they are not alone.  “I believe that the phrase that Robert Aquilina likes to repeat, ‘We will get there’ (Sa Naslu!), is true. It will happen if we don’t give up. It will happen if those who fight for change stop the infighting. It will happen if bridges are built between those who disagree with this corrupt government instead of throwing stones at each other.”  Lauri said that while the pessimist in him “tells me that we will get there too slowly, or tells me that I will at least be here to see it, the developments that are happening around us make me hope that we will get there much sooner.”"

Following publication of Justice Samuel Alito’s leaked opinion raping Roe v. Wade, Pulitzer honoree Linda Greenhouse kernelized the only cogent reason for assassination of a precedent which most of the little legal lightweights had told the U.S. Senate that they considered settled law.  “They did it because they could,” Greenhouse lamented, echoing sentiments which have warmed the Humpty cockles of the rocky hearts of dictators since time immemorial.  In last Sunday’s fake news New York Times, the best commentator in the country, Maureen Dowd, concluded her killer screed stating “Even though I’ve been writing since Bush v. Gore (2000) that the court is full of hacks and the bloom is off the robes, it is still disorienting to see the murk of this Supreme Court.”  Actually, it goes back much further. Control of Black Robe Land by today’s corrupt and self-absorbed majority was fore-ordained more than half a century ago. Just after I invaded these parts from Gomorrah South in 1971, I remember the chill that went down my spine at the announcement that Nevada Republican Party operatives had started a young conservatives club at UNR.  It started paying off just a few years later when a small-government advocate was elected president by promising to clean up the muck of murky Washington. He advocated eroding FDR’s big government welfare state and opposed busing to end school segregation while preaching family values, moral righteousness and religion.  It must have been Ronald Reagan, right? After all, Ronnie the Vague told a Moral Majority gathering that “I know you can’t endorse me but I can endorse you.”  If you guessed that it was the B-movie actor who won the White House playing a perversion of his idol Franklin Roosevelt, you’d be wrong. It was Reagan’s predecessor Jimmy Carter, a master campaigner with slim presidential qualifications, the worst of which was his lack of Washington experience. So he made his thin credentials the centerpiece of his campaign, touting the virtues of being an outsider. Like so many before him, he was hoist from his own petard when Reagan campaigned against him by saying the same thing. “Drain the swamp” still works for dinosaurs posing as alligator hunters.  Fast-forward almost half a century and Dumptyite wolves not only inhabit the henhouse, they’re selling the eggs. Cock-a-doodle-do.  “Americans do not want democracy, they want theocracy,” a French observer noted a few decades back.  The formerly sacrosanct and prestigious Supreme Court is now the appointed-for-life government of the United States. Remember all those moonhowler complaints about an “activist court” and “judge-made law”?  No? Understandable because moonhowler-installed judges are now doing just that.  They have been handsomely rewarded with lucrative deals both aboveboard and under the table. There is no effective remedy. They won and can do whatever they damn well please.  Four decades ago, former Tribunite and legendary talk show icon Travus T. Hipp warned of “softshoe fascism” loose in the land.  Fascism is typified by an authoritarian government which does the bidding of narrow, wealthy, privately-owned interests. As with all dictatorships spawned not by guns but by gushy words enchanting the gullible among the great unwashed, once in power they pull the ladder up behind them.  Said ladder stands on the shredded social safety net of a besieged electorate increasingly unable to elect leaders reflecting their needs — if they are allowed to vote at all.  Corrupt Clarence and his fellow dwarves now have before them a Roe-ing of the 1984 unanimous decision in Chevron v. National Resources Defense Council. Repeal or revision would resemble Alito’s rape of Roe or Neal Gorsuch’s evisceration of the Environmental Protection Agency. (“Poison Annie’s Revenge Executed” Barbwire 7-7-2022; “Happy Co-Dependence Day” 7-3-2005)  I was criticized by the left and right when I asserted that nominee Gorsuch would work to destroy the EPA from which his Mommy Dearest had resigned under a cloud of incompetence, corruption and illegality.  Sometimes I hate it when I’m right. I hope I am proven wrong about the miasma of near-hopelessness enveloping the formerly United States of America.  MEA CULPA DEPT. When I’m wrong, I eat the barbecued crow. A few weeks ago, I praised Reno Gazette-Journal higherups for appointing veteran journalist Peggy Santoro as the second woman executive editor of the paper after Barbara Henry in 1982. Pardon my brain fade. Santoro is the fourth. Like Ms. Henry, Ms. Santoro rose thru the ranks as did Tonia Cunning who became the second. More recently came Kelly Scott, the only one of the four imported from elsewhere into the top job. No matter the numbers game, the principal news dissemination source in northern Nevada has very noticeably improved under Ms. Santoro’s leadership.

THE efforts of the administration of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to find its voice and a steady footing in global affairs are dragged down by doubts pertaining to a critical domestic issue — the fairness of his administration's justice system. An innocent woman, former senator Leila de Lima, has been in detention for six long years. Meanwhile, the hard men, Teves, Bantag, Zulueta et al., are making a mockery of the justice system. Come and get us ... if you can. How can the outside world not take note of the open defiance, the braggadocio and the taunting? We don't even have a clue as to who masterminded the assassination of a Cagayan vice mayor and the ambush of Lanao del Sur Gov. Mamintal Adiong.  The audacity of Mr. Teves to ask for a Zoom link so he can participate in a Senate inquiry on a Negros Oriental massacre of which he is the prime suspect is the kind of perverted audacity to be found only in the political and judicial systems of banana republics, not in functional democracies committed to the rule of law. Nine people gunned down in cold blood in broad daylight, one of them the provincial governor, and the primary suspect is asking for a Zoom link? It cannot get more surreal than this: the audacity of perversity.  As the world watches this mockery of the judicial system unfold, the contrasting optics of a jailed innocent woman silently bearing her many burdens but keeping her faith in the justice system and the hard men mocking the justice system, uncomfortable questions are raised. The House is even conflicted on what to do with Mr. Teves — kid gloves one day, stern warnings the next. Are not parliaments and congresses of true democracies mandated to stand on the right side of history? And grow a spine whenever tough decisions have to be made?  The giddy malevolence to detain an innocent woman and the feckless indecision on the hard men indicted based on overwhelming evidence.  So, it all comes down to this. The judge righting the terrible wrongs on the case of former senator de Lima — which hopefully will soon lead to her release from detention — is doing a yeoman's job in restoring the credibility and fairness of the Philippine justice system. It is the case of Ms. de Lima and her forthcoming clearance from three trumped-up drug charges — the irony is inescapable — which is now saving the blemished judicial system from its horrific failings.  Get the latest news  delivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times’ daily newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy  As the nation ponders on the next chapter in Ms. de Lima's life after her certain release from detention and the end of her nightmarish six years, what comes to mind are words from biblical times and the US civil rights movement. Words that offer comfort and reassurance, balm to the souls of a nation anguished by the long detention of an innocent woman.  First are the words of Martin Luther King Jr. That the arc of the moral universe — the other version is the arc of history — may be long but it bends toward justice. Indeed, it has been a long, grueling six years — about a third of the years that Nelson Mandela spent at Robben Island — but justice will be finally served on former senator de Lima. Two of the three drug charges have been dropped, the last and final charge has no legs to stand on. The coerced witnesses have recanted. She will soon breathe the air of freedom, then reap the recompense due a victim of political vendetta and a vengeful justice system.  What failed to crush the spirit of former senator de Lima definitely made her stronger. Post-detention, the future is full of possibilities. She can run for Senate, on the back of that familiar Filipino sentiment: unqualified sympathy and support for the victims of injustice. She can help energize — she can even lead — the directionless political opposition. She can go back to defending those languishing in prison without cause, the prisoners of conscience and lead an NGO dedicated to the issues of human rights. Her prison years attracted the attention of political leaders from the major democracies, who gave support and encouragement. That group of powerful people vests her with international connections.  What is the guarantee, the certainty, that she would be at the receiving end of glorious and generous recompense? Read the Sermon on the Mount, the greatest speech every written. It says, ""Blessed are the persecuted."" No prominent Filipino in the 21st century has gone through and endured more persecution and vindictiveness than former senator de Lima. Yet, she took everything with equanimity and grit and grace. On the scale of the recompense, the answer is itself biblical — double for your trouble. After the persecution, she will be able to write her future story.  The persecuted, along with the weak and the meek and the humble, have from time immemorial held on to the Beatitudes as their only article of faith toward the path of redemption and liberation. (The same case with us, farmers and workers, because there is no other article of faith to hold on to.) Because no other document in the entire human history is as clear, as explicit, about the blessed status of those in dire straits. Indeed, blessed is Leila de Lima, the persecuted."

Kennedy Jr., who is running in second place to incumbent President Biden in the 2024 primary sweeps, told Fox News that his once antiwar party has made a 180-degree turn as middle-class Americans struggle to live with a hurting economy.  Kennedy, who is the son of former New York senator and U.S. Attorney General Bobby Kennedy, and nephew of former President John Kennedy and ex-Sen. Edward Kennedy, said the party his family once embodied has changed much in recent years.  ""The Democratic Party at this point has become the party of war, which we've never been before. We've sent $113 billion Ukraine and the entire budget of EPA is $12 billion, and the budget at the CDC is $12 billion,"" he said Tuesday on ""Special Report.""  Kennedy argued 57% of Americans could not ""put their hands on $1,000 if they have an emergency.""  RFK JR DOUBLES DOWN ON ALLEGATION CIA INVOLVED IN UNCLE'S ASSASSINATION  ""I think a lot of Americans are feeling like they're tired of the forever-wars,"" he said. ""They're tired of this being a warfare state abroad and a surveillance state at home. And they want to get rid of the surveillance here [and] the wars abroad.""  Kennedy contrasted the trillions in military spending with what some of those funds could do for domestic infrastructure, employment and education.  ""Our real national strength is going to come from economic power and a robust economy and a robust middle class and not from projecting military power abroad,"" he said.  Kennedy also said he has no personal animus against Biden, and has been friends with him for some time, as ""Special Report"" anchor Bret Baier cited a recent poll showing him the closest to the president with 19% support.  ""I have a long kind of friendship and relationship with President Biden, so I'm not criticizing him or attacking him personally. But I think people want to see him out of the White House and actually talking to Americans; going to town halls,"" he said.  ABC NEWS ADMITS EDITING RFK JR'S VAX CLAIMS  ""[He] says that the economy is humming along, but that's not what I hear when I'm out in western Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Hampshire, Florida. I see people really living in a state of desperation that I never thought I would see in the United States of America,"" Kennedy added.  Kennedy compared purported statistics that showed a steep decline in middle-class power and wealth between the 1970s and 2020s, claiming 62% of U.S. income in 1978 was among the middle class, while that figure has dropped to 40%.  ""In 1978, 29% of income went to the super rich. [Now] it's 50%. And that was aggravated, of course, by the pandemic,"" he said, adding that some of that dearth was a product of what he called ""Donald Trump's pandemic lockdown – which created 500 new billionaires.""  CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Kennedy signaled he is not a fan of some of the former Republican president's policies while dismissing a charge in the Washington Post that his candidacy is Trumpism with a Camelot label.  ""His name is Kennedy. His campaign is pure Trump,"" Baier read of the headline from the paper, which also wrote that Kennedy is offering a ""variation"" on Trumpian criticisms of government and science while ""stoking fear and resentment,"" claiming the 2nd place Democrat's campaign sounds somewhat like Trump's own ""America First"" bid.  Kennedy responded that Trump's tenure saw $4 trillion in wealth shifted to the ""super-rich"" and that there have been millions of business closures under the Republican's administration that have also followed into Biden's tenure.  ""I think a lot of Americans want somebody who's really going to start listening to the middle class, understanding the desperation that so many Americans feel, and that is going to do something about it,"" he said."

The latest round in tensions between Baku and Tehran, whose relations have traditionally been strained, came after the expulsion of diplomats from both countries.  On Tuesday, Azerbaijan’s law enforcement forces arrested people who “were working for Iranian secret services,” the interior ministry, security service, and the office of prosecutor general said in a joint statement.  The statement gave nine names and said several other people had been arrested.  The group was plotting a “violent overthrow of the government and the assassinations of prominent personalities and senior officials,” the statement said.  The wave of arrests follows the detention of six Azerbaijani nationals in a different case in April. They were accused of being “recruited by Iranian secret services to destabilize the situation in the country.”  Azerbaijan is a close ally of Iran’s historical rival, Turkey.  Tehran also fears that Israel – a major weapons supplier to Azerbaijan – could use Azerbaijani territory for an offensive against Iran.  Ties between neighbors Azerbaijan and Iran further soured in January when a gunman stormed into Baku’s embassy in Tehran.  He killed a diplomat and wounded two embassy security guards.  The Azerbaijani foreign ministry blamed Iran for the shooting, a claim that the Iranian foreign ministry has rejected.  Earlier in May, Iran expelled four Azerbaijani diplomats. The foreign ministry said the move was “in response” to Baku’s expulsion of Iranian embassy staff in April."

(Ariel Schalit / Associated Press)  Now that there’s an Israeli-Palestinian cease-fire in place this week, brokered with the help of Egypt, it’s critical that the two sides not stop with this short-term agreement.  For this cease-fire — in fact, any cease-fire — to become permanent, we need a political process to begin immediately. The alternative is to keep seeing Israelis and Palestinians traumatized and killed as militants and politicians practice one-upmanship against each other.  It would be easy to place blame on this or that side. It’s possible to list the number of Palestinian rockets that were launched at Israel and the number of targets that Israel attacked. But what good would that do?  The Palestinian-Israeli cycle of violence has become so normalized that it no longer elicits serious interest from the world community. Whether one side uses precision rockets that kill children and women or the other uses indiscriminate rockets that cause injury, death and destruction, the resulting carnage is the same.  Those on each side scream that there is no partner on the other side, when what they mean is that there is no partner that fits their own perception of a good counterpart. But peace is made with enemies.  Resorting to violence, whether it is extrajudicial assassination or indiscriminate shelling, is not the answer. Both are war crimes and perpetrators must be held accountable. But the conflict is not symmetrical, and so solutions might require more from one side than the other. Anyone who really wants to end this conflict must invest time and effort into forcing everyone back to the negotiating table.  In all cases, some fundamental principles need to be established. Self-determination is a right for all people, and the application of this right cannot be limited to one side of the conflict. It is impossible to talk about Israel’s political rights without equally respecting Palestinian political rights.  A solution to the conflict requires an end to occupation, allowing Palestinians to live in freedom whether this is in their own sovereign and contiguous state or in a single state where all citizens have equal rights. The current discriminatory situation with one side occupying the lands of the other side must stop.  Story continues  All sides have to commit to refraining from actions that can affect the outcome of negotiations. This includes stopping Israeli settlement expansion, and both sides must ensure that civilians are protected from violence — from the Israeli army and settlers as well as from Palestinian paramilitary organizations.  There has to be a commitment to discussing in good faith the future of Jerusalem, settlements, refugees and borders. And there needs to be a Palestinian commitment to security coordination, conditional on Israel respecting Palestinian sovereignty in major cities. Something as basic a right as a free passage between Gaza and the West Bank must be respected.  No one is naïve enough to think that these commitments will happen overnight. Any political process — even to begin a process — will need the support of the people of the region and the international community. Staying away from a conflict in which one side is powerful and the other side weak (but not willing to surrender) will not produce any kind of solution.  We cannot afford to accept the idea that we’re doomed to a never-ending conflict. This would be a cop-out. But we need to go beyond politically correct statements and positions if we’re to find a way out.  Despite all the problems and the decades of war, there is still a genuine yearning for peace. While in the middle of a cycle of violence, all sides are polarized, and everyone returns to their known positions and embraces the policies of their tribe, right or wrong. This cannot go on.  Palestinians and Israelis have been unable to find a comprehensive solution. Right now, everyone is taking sides while living in the middle of the bloodshed. What is needed is help from outside to get us out of the mess we are in.  For the sake of our children, the international community has to resume a role in helping to break this cycle of violence. Yes, it will take sustained effort. But Israelis and Palestinians cannot do it alone.

The case involves a suspect Philippe Hategekimana 67, Rwandan naturalized French (since 2005) under the name of Philippe Manier and the prosecution at the French Court of Assise.  This former chief warrant officer at the Gendarmerie of Nyanza, in the prefecture of Butare (southern Rwanda) during the Genocide, was famously known under the name Biguma.  He was arrested in March 2018 in Yaoundé-Cameroon and extradited to France, then indicted and placed in pre-trial detention the following year.  He is accused of genocide, crimes against humanity and participation in a group for the preparation of Genocide crimes.  More precisely, Hategekimana is accused to have participated in the erection of two roadblocks which intended to control and assassinate Tutsi civilians. Hundreds of Tutsi indeed were assassinated at these spots, according to the prosecution.  He is further accused of assassination of the burgomaster of Ntyazo, Narcisse Nyagasaza and the massacre of Tutsi who had taken refuge at Nyabubare and Nyamure hills of Rwabicuma and Muyira sectors of Nyanza district respectively.  This is on top of an alleged participation in several meetings aimed at preparing or coordinating the crimes.  In a press release before the trial, the French national anti-terrorist prosecutor’s office (Pnat) indicated that the massacre cost lives of 300 Tutsi and 10,000 Tutsi at Nyabubare and Nyamure hills respectively.  At the meeting to prepare the trial on May 10, already, the prosecution, the defense and even the presiding judge promised that the case will involve strong emotions, thus a warning to parties in the trial, especially the witnesses to get ready and to know to control their emotions because “violent scenarios will most likely be described.”  I am not the person you are looking for  As in any court case, at the trial kick off, the defence and their client played the first card, that of identity, alleging that the person in front of the court, was not the same person the prosecution was talking about.  The defence played around the name of the alias of their clients, arguing that “Biguma was found guilty, of Genocide offenses, but Phlippe Hategekimana was acquitted by Gacaca Court.”  However, the defendant later on admitted to being Biguma, a name he got while in military training back in Rwanda.  After this, the other big question was around his naturalisation which he obtained after giving a wrong name of Philippe Manier, instead of Philippe Hategekimana.  The wrong identity, he said, he invented while still in a refugee camp in Kashusha-South Kivu of  “You used a wrong identity to get the nationality of France while taking the name Manier?” asked the presiding judge, to which he responded: “Yes. At first, to obtain refugee status, we needed a convincing document.”  Audition of Testimonies  In this trial where more than 90 witnesses could be heard, already the witnesses of the context are being heard, and as earlier promised, they are sharing strong testimonies.  They even include Western Citizens and Rwandan citizen who were in Rwanda during the 1994 Genocide against Tutsi. Even the foreigners, can share the places where Interahamwe militia were the most brutal with mutilation of women, rape among others.  Several witnesses include researchers, historians among other people who did not just see one incident of Genocide, but many, and also did more research on the background that led to the Genocide tragedy in Rwanda.  The list also includes former leaders in the Rwanda military and gendarmerie and officials under the Juvenal Habyarimana’s regime  One of the witnesses, Hélène Dumas 41, a Doctor in social sciences and specialist on Genocide against Tutsi went as far as sharing a story of a girl who was obliged to feed on blood after starving.  Hélène understands quite everything in the Genocide, and even, Rwanda’s reconciliation’s home-grown solutions and recovery efforts, to an extent that she is even able to explain ‘Gacaca jurdictions’ from its etymology.  Of all things that were said, some witnesses were direct to mention the name Philippe Hategekimana as a person who was involved in the Genocide, and yesterday, as the presiding judge asked the defendant what he would add, he was prompt to say.  “Everything they said is false.”  Hategekimana’s defence include Me Emmanuel Altit, Alexis Guedj and Fabio Lhote."

The independent Russian portal Agentstwo claims that former US ambassador to Ukraine, John Herbst is among these Moscow's would-be victims.  The diplomat complained of mysterious health problems similar to symptoms of poisoning back in 2021, a few months before Russia had invaded Ukraine. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has launched an investigation into the case, the website reported, citing its informants who remain anonymous.    Herbst was the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine between 2003-2006 and headed the U.S. diplomatic mission in Uzbekistan.    The head of the Free Russia Foundation, Natalia Arno, was another target of the Russian secret services. The activist, while visiting the Czech Republic on business at the beginning of May 2023, had suddenly started feeling numbness and pain in various parts of her body. Shortly before these symptoms appeared, Arno had discovered a break-in into her hotel room.    She also reported a strange smell in the room resembling “the smell of cheap perfume”. Following the incident Arno immediately returned to the United States, where she lives. The FBI has also launched an investigation into the matter, since the Free Russia Foundation, headed by Arno, is based in Washington.    The independent portal claims that the head of investigative portal Bellingcat, Christo Grozev, has also fallen victim to the Kremlin’s agents. In the summer of 2022, during a journalistic conference in Montenegro, unknown perpetrators broke into his hotel room stealing several items, including his smartphone.    A few months later Grozev decided to move from Austria to the USA after he received warnings of an assassination attempt."

If convicted — and that is a very big IF — he could face anywhere between 5-to-15 years in prison. Penny had at least two accomplices who held Neely’s arms and legs as he was being slowly asphyxiated; the two have not been charged.  When Penny was brought in for questioning by the New York Police Department May 1 — the day that the murder took place on a F subway train, he was released without being charged with anything.  Starting on May 2, spontaneous and planned demonstrations took place for days, including one that blocked a subway track, demanding that Penny be charged. That demand wasn’t realized until May 12, when Penny turned himself in after the District Attorney announced the manslaughter charges. Jordan Neely’s family and their attorneys, while saying they were “pleased” with the charges, had asked that Penny be charged with second-degree murder, which would have amounted to a harsher sentence if convicted.  Penny was immediately released on $100,000 bail. How did such a large sum get raised so fast? A white supremacist-based crowd fundraising site, under the guise of being “Christian,” GiveSendGo, has raised over $1 million to date to support Penny’s legal expenses. The fundraising was organized by his lawyers; within just 24 hours of Penny being charged, $600,000 was raised for his defense.  This same site raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for white-supremacist Kyle Rittenhouse, who killed two anti-racist Black Lives Matter protesters in Wisconsin in 2020; the January 6, 2021, pro-Trump U.S. Capitol riot defendants; and the so-called “Freedom Convoy” — a group of truckers in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, who in 2022 protested a rule requiring cross-border drivers to be vaccinated.  Extreme right-wing Republicans like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Twitter owner and billionaire Elon Musk and Fox News pundits all praised Penny for the killing. Their comments condoning Neely’s death are too disgusting to mention here.  Once again, the character of the victim — in this case Jordan Neely — a houseless, hungry, mentally ill and desperate man, who happened to be Black, is being put on trial in public. Penny’s lawyers will use character assassination as a major defense to justify this killing by a white vigilante.  And this kind of heinous reaction is not isolated to just one individual. It is part of a racist war to justify such murders by the police and racist vigilantes like Penny by demonizing the victims, especially young Black men like Neely, Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, Trayvon Martin in Florida and even 12-year-old Tamir Rice in Ohio, who were all falsely and cruelly labeled a danger and a menace to society.  And the fact that a sector of the ruling class supports the actions of Penny illustrates that he has a lot of big-business support to attempt to exonerate him of this terrible crime.  This is another reason why a united political classwide struggle should abolish this horrendous capitalist system — to guarantee all the human needs that the Jordan Neelys of the world cry out for and deserve."

In fact, this is shaping up to be one of the best Assassin’s Creed games yet. We have known that this title is going to be a return to the series’ roots for a while now, but a content creator with a history of AC Mirage leaks has further teased a myriad of features that suggest we could be in for an investigative gameplay experience more similar to what we would see in IO Interactive’s Hitman series – and that’s very exciting.  Discussing leaked information about Assassin’s Creed Mirage in French, which was initially translated by fans on this Assassin’s Creed subreddit post and then double-checked by The Loadout using YouTube’s translation tool, renowned leaker ‘j0nathon’ has shared that this game will feature fewer assassination targets than recent Assassin’s Creed games that players will need to spend time investigating before attempting to eliminate – with options opening up as you continue to uncover more information about each target.  At a basic level, before looking into the details, this is something that echoes the gameplay structure presented to players in the immensely-popular stealth-action series Hitman World of Assassination. You’re thrown into an environemnt where you must investigate to find out where your target is, or will be, and how you can eliminate them. We know that is a little reductive, but that’s the bare bones of the gameplay structure – and that sounds like what we’re getting in Assassin’s Creed Mirage.  Fuelling comparisons further, while also further reinforcing claims that this game will see the reintroduction of a notoriety system to the Assassin’s Creed series, ‘j0nathan’ has also expressed that Basim will have “very little life” – dying after just a couple of hits. This will encourage stealth-based gameplay and – once again – echoes the Hitman series. Those of you who have played this game will know it’s not as easy as it looks to shoot your way out of a sticky situation if you’ve been spotted.  While this information, like these recent Assassin’s Creed Mirage leaks, will be welcome news to fans who don’t particularly like the RPG-heavy focus the series has taken with recent entries, it does suggest that we might be met with some rather out-dated gameplay experiences when the Assassin’s Creed Mirage release date rolls around. Missions structured around tailing targets and eavesdropping conversations are dated, but this is where Ubisoft could draw on Hitman to save Assassin’s Creed from these mediocre moments.  IO Interactive leans into these sorts of gameplay sequences in the Hitman series, but they’re presented to players as optional objectives – and always situated in a largely unguided mission overflowing with options when it comes to how you approach the main objective: eliminating your target.  At the moment, though, we don’t know how much freedom Assassin’s Creed players will enjoy when it comes to undertaking these investigations. But, we’re hopeful – it just remains to be seen whether that hope was misplaced, or not. As you can see below, though, the leaker sharing this information compares a lot of this to the original Assassin’s Creed game – which is somewhat worrying. However, like us, they also suggest that the “black box missions” – where you actually assassinate your target – will draw inspiration from the Hitman series.  We know it’s important to take every leak with a pinch or two of salt, as there’s no telling how true this all is, but ‘j0nathan’ has a good track record when it comes to Assassin’s Creed Mirage leaks that corroborate with others and all the information he’s shared seems to line up with what we know officially about the game so far. GamesRadar’s interview with creative director Stéphane Boudon is packed with information about the scope and scale of this title – and where Ubisoft is drawing inspiration (although Hitman isn’t mentioned).  Will it be one of the best games of all time? We’re not so sure about that, as there’s some stiff competition there, but a Basim-based Assassin’s Creed game is bound to be interesting. So, while we wait for more information on all the Assassin’s Creed multiplayer games Ubisoft is supposedly working on, we can’t think of anyone better to lead the next chapter in this series."

Photos / Getty Images, AP  Celebrities fool us with their jaw-dropping film stunts so often it feels like they are superhuman. But it turns out some of their near-death experiences would leave even Hollywood shocked.  A prime example came earlier in the year when Marvel star Jeremy Renner narrowly escaped death trying to stop his seven-tonne Pistenbully snowplough from running over his nephew. After breaking more than 30 broken bones and a punctured lung, the actor has undergone intensive rehab and is finally back on his feet.  Jamie Foxx also suffered a close call recently when he was rushed to hospital with an unknown medical emergency. One month later, the star is reportedly still in hospital and little has been revealed about his condition.  But Renner and Foxx aren’t the only famous faces who have escaped death in their lifetime. Ozzy Osbourne has experienced a few near-death scenarios, Emilia Clarke survived two brain aneurysms and Kanye West was involved in a terrifying car accident.  From house fires to plane accidents and strokes, here are nine celebrities who cheated death:  Drew Barrymore  Drew Barrymore. Photo / Getty Images  She’s a Hollywood sweetheart with a slew of successful films behind her and a talk show that makes other celebrities feel at home - but all that could have been quite different for the actress if it weren’t for her labrador, Flossie.  In 2001, Barrymore and her then-fiance Tom Green almost died in a fire when their five-bedroom home in Beverly Hills caught fire. Asleep and unaware of the flames engulfing their estate, the couple narrowly escaped thanks to their dog.  A spokesperson told the New York Post at the time, “Flossie barked and literally banged on their bedroom door. She was really the main alert that there was a fire.” Still groggy from sleep, Barrymore then smelt smoke and woke up Green before calling emergency services, however the fast-moving blaze cut into the telephone wires and the line went dead.  Thankfully the dispatchers located the address and Barrymore, Green, Flossie and her two other dogs, Highla Flopsy and Templeton, escaped through heavy smoke.  Mark Wahlberg  Mark Wahlberg. Photo / AP  The heartbreaking terrorist attack that killed 3002 people on September 11, 2001 almost saw a very famous casualty.  Wahlberg was initially booked on American Airlines Flight 11 - the plane which crashed into the north tower of the World Trade Centre - but he changed his flight to a different one a few days earlier.  Wahlberg narrowly cheating death was all thanks to a friend who had asked him to change his plans and fly up to Toronto to watch his film at the Toronto Film Festival.  Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane also had a ticket for the same flight but his agent told him the wrong departure time, which saw the star miss boarding by a few minutes. He ultimately took another flight and survived.  Sharon Stone  Sharon Stone. Photo / Getty Images  At 65 years old, Sharon Stone has done a lot in her lifetime including winning a Golden Globe. But there were moments she wasn’t sure she was going to see the future, let alone the next day.  Speaking to The Sun in 2020, the actress revealed she has cheated death three times, once after being struck by lightning, another after suffering a stroke, and once when she almost cut her jugular open.  She told the news outlet: “I’ve had a lot of things, it’s crazy. I had my neck cut to a sixteenth of an inch from my jugular vein when I was 14 on a clothesline.  “I’ve been hit by lightning and, wow, that was really intense,” she said, adding, “I was at home, we had our own well. I was filling up the iron with water and I had my hand on the tap.  “The well got hit by lightning and it came up through the water. I was indoors and I got picked up and thrown across the kitchen and hit the refrigerator. Thankfully my mum belted me round the face and brought me to.”  As if that wasn’t enough, the Pennsylvania-born actress also suffered a stroke in 2001 and was hospitalised for nine days as a result. Despite her 1 per cent chance of survival, the mother-of-three is alive and well, reflecting on how “tremendously lucky” she is to be alive.  Speaking to Harpers Bazaar, she said, “I felt like I had been shot in the head. I remember laying there thinking, ‘I’m having a stroke’.”  Following the stroke, the actress underwent a seven-hour surgery and had 22 coils inserted into her brain.  Leonardo DiCaprio  Leonardo DiCaprio. Photo / AP  While the encounters were quite different, much like Stone, DiCaprio has cheated death three times.  The Hollywood alum told Wired magazine in 2015 that he has escaped death three times - one of those times being when a great white shark “jumped into my cage when I was diving in South Africa”.  “Half its body was in the cage, and it was snapping at me,” DiCaprio recalled. “They leave the tops open and you have a regulator line running to the surface. Then they chum the water with tuna. A wave came and the tuna sort of flipped up into the air. A shark jumped up and grabbed the tuna, and half its body landed inside the cage with me. I sort of fell down to the bottom and tried to lie flat.  “The great white took about five or six snaps an arm’s length away from my head. The guys there said that has never happened in the 30 years they’d been doing it.”  Other near-death experiences the star survived included his plane engine exploding mid-air and a skydiving mishap when both of his parachutes had issues and almost didn’t open. The first chute was tangled and so was the second, but thankfully the instructor untangled it in time and they landed injury-free.  Queen Elizabeth  Queen Elizabeth II. Photo / AP  In 1981, Queen Elizabeth’s reign almost came to an end when a New Zealand man conducted an assassination attempt.  On October 14 that year, 17-year-old Christopher Lewis tracked the royal tour to the Otago Museum in Dunedin where he concealed a .22 (5.6mm) calibre rifle in an old pair of jeans and hid in a toilet cubical at the Adams Building. Out of sight from the general public, Lewis pointed the gun out of the window and shot at the Queen as she exited a car.  Thankfully, the shot did not hit the Queen or anyone else but it did create a loud noise and police told journalists that it was from a sign falling down.  Jackie Chan  Jackie Chan.  He’s one of the greatest stuntmen in the world and is known for performing all of his own film stunts but one performance almost changed everything for Jackie Chan.  While filming a stunt for the 1986 film Armour of God, Chan’s character chugs from a freshly opened beer can and leaps off a ledge before swinging from a tree. The first stunt went smoothly but when he attempted it again things took a scary turn.  Chan made it to the tree but unfortunately slipped and plummeted to the ground where he hit his head on a rock and cracked his skull. The injury left him with internal bleeding and blood dripping out of his ear. The film crew didn’t have a medical professional onsite and had to carry him down the mountain they were filming on to the hospital where “surgeons tended to his cracked skull and the bone that had penetrated his brain as a result of the fall”, reports said.  Other injuries the actor has sustained include a pelvis dislocation, spinal damage, broken bones - and he has even been electrocuted.  Isla Fisher  Isla Fisher. Photo / Getty Images  Actress Isla Fisher revealed on Chelsea Lately in 2013 that while shooting a scene for the hit film Now You See Me, she was stuck underwater for almost three minutes.  Fisher was in the middle of filming a magic trick in a water tank that was meant to be a simple escape for the star, however she found herself in trouble when her release chain got stuck in her costume.  “I was actually drowning,” she said. “Everyone thought I was acting fabulously... no one realised I was actually struggling.”  Despite laughing while telling the story, the actress said it was a traumatising ordeal.  Brendan Fraser  Brendan Fraser in The Mummy.  Brendan Fraser made his welcome return to Hollywood last year after starring in the award-winning film, The Whale but his acting career - and life - almost came to an end while filming the 1999 film The Mummy.  In one scene Fraser’s character was meant to be hung, so he was standing on a platform with a rope around his neck. Wanting the scene to look as realistic as possible, the star recalled the moment telling UK comedy show, There’s Something About Movies, “I remember the camera came around, and I thought, ‘I’m gonna make this look really good,’ so I sort of took a few deep breaths and kind of barred down. Then I realized I was on the balls of my feet and the rope was going up and I had nowhere to go. Then the world kind of dialled down.”  The star passed out and was thankfully okay but woke up to the film’s stunt co-ordinator clapping in his face. “He goes, ‘Hey. Congratulations. You just joined the club with Mel Gibson. He got choked out on Braveheart, too.’”  Emilia Clarke  Emilia Clarke. Photo / Getty Images  Game of Thrones actress Emilia Clarke suffered not one but two brain aneurysms throughout her rise to fame on the hit series and it resulted in the inability to use significant parts of her brain.  Speaking to the BBC last year, the 36-year-old star said, “It was the most excruciating pain,” explaining she suffered severe headaches that came on suddenly during a workout in February 2011, roughly around the time she was wrapping up filming the first season of the HBO hit.  “The amount of my brain that is no longer usable... it’s remarkable that I am able to speak, sometimes articulately, and live my life completely normally with absolutely no repercussions.”  She said after her second major episode, blood was cut off to her brain for over a minute, meaning it will no longer work. She likened the condition to having your brain “short circuit”.                "

His story has been recently covered by the HBO series White House Plumbers, and through that show, we get some hints about his involvement in some of the most significant milestones in American history, from the Bay of Pigs invasion to the Watergate scandal, up to his famous deathbed confession where he revealed classified information related to the assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy. His true story can become a book, but in this article, we will summarize the main points of his life.  Before the White House Plumbers and Watergate: The Bay of Pigs invasion  E. Howard Hunt joined the CIA in 1949. He was immediately assigned to political action and influence, in the department that later became the CIA’s Special Activities Division. As part of that role, he actively participated in the United States’ operation in Cuba in 1961, culminating in the Bay of Pigs invasion.  That operation intended to overthrow Fidel Castro’s government in Cuba as part of the broader Cold War of those years. The Bay of Pigs invasion was supposed to be a military operation secretly supported by the United States. The plan was to land a force of Cuban exiles, trained and supported by the CIA, at the Bay of Pigs on the southern coast of Cuba. The hope was that a popular uprising would follow, leading to the downfall of Castro.  The operation was planned and approved during the administration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, but it was carried out under President John F. Kennedy. The CIA trained and equipped around 1,400 Cuban exiles for the invasion. Howard Hunt was among those who were preparing the exiles for the government they were supposed to form after the invasion, under the direct influence of the United States. However, the Bay of Pigs invasion failed: John F. Kennedy decided to withhold air support after the international community became aware of the operation, which became the decisive factor for the failure.  That’s why the Bay of Pigs invasion is mentioned so often in the HBO series White House Plumbers: it’s considered an emblematic example of how operations fail if those who order them step back in the middle of the action. For Howard Hunt, the failure of the Cuban operation became a crucial turning point for his career: after that scandal, Kennedy’s administration publicly reacted against the CIA’s covert operations. From this point of view, Howard Hunt became one of those officers who needed to be blamed as a bad guy, although he was just executing orders. This detail of Howard Hunt’s perspective will come back soon.  The Watergate scandal  When Howard Hunt was assigned as one of the heads of the White House Plumbers, his task was (again) to execute an order: his team had to bug the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington, D.C. However, on June 17, 1972, the burglars who broke into the Watergate complex were arrested, and quite soon, the connection with Howard Hunt and Gordon Liddy became clear.  In the beginning, after the arrests, Nixon’s administration put its best effort into covering up the White House Plumbers operation, in an attempt to avoid a reputation problem for the U.S. President. As we know, the attempt failed: thanks to the efforts of newspapers like The Washington Post, Time, and The New York Times, with the help of the infamous deep throat in contact with the reporters, it was revealed that the White House deposited considerable sums of money in the bank accounts of the burglars, trying to cover the operation’s costs and motivate them to hide precious information during the trial.  Once again, Howard Hunt was first asked to execute the orders, then became a public problem for the United States government. As reported by the New York Times in this article, during the Watergate investigations, Howard Hunt declared in front of the Senate committee:  “I am crushed by the failure of my government to protect me and my family as in the past it has always done for its clandestine agents. I cannot escape feeling that the country I have served for my entire life and which directed me to carry out the Watergate entry is punishing me for doing the very things it trained and directed me to do.”  In December 1972, in the middle of the Watergate investigations, Howard Hunt’s wife Dorothy died in a mysterious plane crash. According to their son Saint John Hunt, who years later disclosed important information he knew from his father, the crash was orchestrated to put pressure on his dad. As reported in this article, he said: “A day after my mom died, my dad pled guilty. The day after the plane crash, Nixon appointed one of his closest advisers to head the crash investigation.”  Howard Hunt served 33 months in prison for the Watergate scandal. After he was released, he will spend the rest of his life as a book writer. But before dying, he had the chance to reveal some secret information that became famous as the “deathbed confession of Howard Hunt.”  The deathbed confession of Howard Hunt  The deathbed confession is a series of tapes recorded by Howard Hunt in 2004 and sent to his son Saint John Hunt. The content of these tapes was first revealed in 2007 on RollingStone and then became part of the book Saint John published in 2012, Bond of Secrecy: My Life with CIA Spy and Watergate Conspirator E. Howard Hunt. You can hear part of the content of that tapes in the video below, inside an interview Saint John had with Coast to Coast Live.  Deathbed Confession of E Howard Hunt Watch this video on YouTube.  It’s important to note that the accusations in Howard Hunt’s deathbed confession have never been proven, and many consider them just a conspiracy theory. The content, after all, is explosive: in that tape, Hunt explains that there was a direct connection between the assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy and key figures of the United States government, implying that the murder was ordered by Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson, who wanted to become President (he succeeded Kennedy in 1963).  It’s the last element that gives an aura of mystery to the life of Howard Hunt. The rest can be discovered in books, movies, and TV shows, as we are seeing in HBO’s White House Plumbers.  Read other true stories behind movies and TV series on Auralcrave"

A Caribbean Media Corporation story reports Haiti's Foreign Affairs Minister Mr Jean Généus as saying that Prime Minister Ariel Henry recently spoke with Senegalese President Macky Sall, and talks are being held with other African and Latin American countries.  The Haitian Government has apparently come to the conclusion that there is a lack of interest on the part of Western states to provide military assistance to Haiti, which has been gripped by political and economic crises since the assassination of President Jovenel Moise in July 2021.  Rival gangs have taken control of up to 80 per cent of the capital, Port-au-Prince, and have continued a deadly fight for more territory.  The UN reports that more than 840 people were killed in the first three months of this year, while over 600 people have been slain in April alone. Also, more than 400 people have been kidnapped so far this year.  And, if that were not bad enough, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has reported that the gang violence has placed more than 115,000 children at the risk of starving to death this year, an increase from the near 86,000 last year.  Adding to the Haitian people's woes is the more than 41,000 suspected cases of cholera reported since the resurgence of the acute diarrhoeal illness in October, with children under the age of 14 making up almost half of the cases, UNICEF has told us.  The UN agency says it urgently needs US$17 million to help detect malnutrition and purchase food and medicine. If that support does not become available, more children will die.  There are people in Haiti who are strongly opposed to the international community sending help in the form of police or military personnel. At the same time, as we have pointed out in this space before the obvious hesitance by some countries to offer help is most likely fuelled by the fact that Haiti hasn't been able to shake instability, and previous attempts at military aid in the form of boots on the ground have not gone well.  However, the situation there, correctly described as ""tragic"" by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres during a joint news conference with Jamaica's Prime Minister Andrew Holness on Monday at Jamaica House is untenable and has the potential of spilling over into the wider region.  Mr Holness also explained that it's not that the pleas from the UN and the Caribbean for help have fallen on deaf ears. ""The question,"" he said, ""is the pace of action, and countries who would want to support would also want to be assured that there is a political process in place that could yield an end result in a time frame that makes sense.""  That is not an unreasonable position.  A possible solution, we believe, is for a mediation team to get all players in the political conflict in Haiti involved in talks aimed at holding elections to install a legitimate Government. Naturally, those polls would require international observers to ensure transparency and acceptance of the results.  Additionally, a strategy to confront and dismantle the gangs is necessary."

On Saturday at 10 pm Al-Quds time, an Egyptian-brokered ceasefire between the Palestinian Resistance and the Israeli occupation took effect following a five-day Israeli aggression against the Gaza Strip, which led to the martyrdom of 33 Palestinian and the injury of 100, in addition to huge material losses.  Immediately after the ceasefire was announced and took effect, Gazans took to the streets to celebrate victory in Operation Avenging the Free, which the Palestinian Resistance launched against the Israeli occupation in response to the latter's assassination of commanders and the brutal killing of civilians.  In conjunction with the celebrations, the Joint Operations Room of the Palestinian Resistance Factions in Gaza said Operation Avenging the Free is a new chapter of glory that the Resistance fought as a unified structure, warning that although the operation has ended, the banners of Resistance will not and shall not be lowered and the will to fight will not and shall not ever dwindle.  On his part, the Secretary-General of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) movement, Ziad Al-Nakhalah, said the Palestinian people, despite the pain, came out with their heads held high everywhere, in Gaza, the West Bank, and across the world, in support of the Resistance, describing these days as ""days of honor and dignity for our people, who, with simple resources, are facing all this aggression.""  One might wonder how the Palestinian Resistance and Gazans claimed a victory over the Israeli aggression, despite all the assassinations, killings, and destruction caused by the occupation.  Touching on the matter, Al Mayadeen analyst for Arab and regional affairs, Abdelrahman Nassar, pointed out that the main idea is to break the Israeli dictates, because ""Israel's"" goal behind the assassinations was to break the morale of the people.  Nassar explained that when Gazans witnessed the Resistance continuously bombing Israeli military sites, settlements, and cities and causing casualties among the Israelis until the last moment before the ceasefire entered into force, they considered the ceasefire a victory, steadfastness, and perseverance.  ""Simply rejecting Israeli dictates in this way is a victory,"" Nassar told Al Mayadeen English.  The Palestinian analyst indicated that despite the great wounds, Gazans decided to remain steadfast for many reasons, the most important of which is that they do not like to display their suffering in front of the Israeli occupation, considering all the difficult circumstances they have been under as part of the ongoing 15-year blockade on the Strip.  An upcoming assassination at any moment  Asked about the reason why “Israel” launched its heinous aggression against Gaza at this particular time, Nassar considered that the decision on the timing of the aggression was taken in 2022. He cited an Israeli Channel 14 report as saying that the security establishment confirmed the aggression on Gaza was not a response to the firing of 104 rockets toward ""Sderot"" in retaliation to Sheikh Khader Adnan’s martyrdom in Israeli occupation prisons, but rather a settling of accounts with the PIJ for each rocket launched since the beginning of the year and the movement’s role in Resistance operations in the occupied West Bank.  Nassar considered that ""Israel's"" concern is not the rocket firing from Gaza, since this matter is still unsolvable to the occupation, nor is it the PIJ's influential commanders, as there are similar influential leaders in other Palestinian factions. Rather, according to Nassar, ""Israel's"" problem is that the PIJ is at the forefront of the Resistance’s acts in the West Bank, and hence, the occupation tried to pressure the PIJ to prevent it from pursuing this progress. Therefore, the timing is just a factor related to field conditions and is mainly linked to the occupied West Bank, he noted.  Nassar cited another reason for the aggression -- a political factor related to the internal Israeli crisis over the judicial overhaul.  According to Nassar, ""Israel"" also tried to create a rift between the Palestinian Resistance factions and failed miserably as coordination between the factions was apparent during the aggression, and this is another aspect that boosted the morale of the people.  However, Nassar believed that from the present moment, ""Israel"" will continue to focus on the PIJ, predicting an upcoming assassination at any moment or a coming battle this year or the following.

Nevertheless, he pointed out that were it not for the Resistance's rockets, ""the media would have broadcast the images of our martyrs, wounded, and destroyed homes from one side only, just as the situation was in 2010 and before.""  ""After 2012, when the Resistance began to put Israel under constant anxiety, the situation changed.""  He added that despite the Resistance not being able to inflict huge casualties, Israeli settlers assert that they ""love life"" and disrupting their daily lives and spreading fear among them through rocket firing is enough in the meantime.  According to Nassar, the Israelis are infamous for keeping secret their casualties in all confrontations against Lebanon and Palestine, be they military or not.  Read more: PIJ can manage the battle for long days: Israeli media  Israeli media admits no solution to Gaza challenge  Touching on the Israeli media's feedback on the recent aggression, Nassar pointed out that the media will not attack the occupation army directly. He mentioned that the Israeli media praised the army's performance but criticized that of the political establishment. However, he noted that the media admitted that ""Israel"" has not been able to find a solution to the Gaza challenge.  Nassar had previously touched on the path that was followed to reach a ceasefire. He asserted that the Palestinian Resistance's position was clear from the beginning, which is that it will not end this round unless it forces the Israeli occupation to stop the assassinations and targeting of its leaders and the bombing of homes and civilians.

C., May 16, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- A documentary has been released telling the stories of Catholic University’s efforts to recruit and welcome Black students, especially from the Washington, D.C. area through its “Partnership Program.” Fifty years after the University’s first graduates of the Partnership Program — created in the wake of the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. — the documentary examines its founding, its struggles, and the progress being made to create a more diverse campus community.  Catholic University admitted 30 Black students mainly from the local area through the Partnership Program. To mark its success and the work that has been done, the University bestowed honorary doctoral degrees to the program's first directors, Leon LeBuffe and Thaddeus Aubry at the University-wide Commencement ceremony on May 13.  The documentary, No Longer Out of Reach, was directed and produced by award-winning filmmaker and journalist Chris Jenkins. The documentary features four of the program’s first participants along with Aubry and LeBuffe, both alumni, telling their stories. Additional voices from former students and archival footage complete the narrative about how Black students first faced significant struggles to get an education and how the University has been supporting the program since its founding in 1969.

Kilpatrick, president of Catholic University. “Both of these extraordinary gentlemen offered their offices, homes, and time to students and were dedicated and welcoming.”  The Partnership Program has helped scores of Black students from the Washington metropolitan area attend Catholic University. In 1968, the year before the program started, there were seven Black undergraduates on campus. Now total undergraduate and graduate enrollment of Black students accounts for approximately 10% of the total student body.  Story continues  During LeBuffe and Aubry’s tenure, they personally mentored every matriculating program student — from their first days on campus through graduation. Even the few who ultimately did not complete the program benefited from their attention. This impact was felt so strongly and had such a profound impact on program graduates that the group established an endowed scholarship — the Thaddeus F. Aubry Jr. and Leon LeBuffe Scholarship — to honor their legacy and help current and future Black students at Catholic University through financial grants.  No Longer Out of Reach features four of the original 30 Black students admitted in 1969: Elvira Wise Smith, Ronny B. Lancaster, Andrea Cullins, and Kenneth Walker. The partners recount their experiences and journeys as Black students on Catholic University’s campus in the 70s. LeBuffe and Aubry discuss the role they played to bridge the gap and help students acclimate to the almost entirely white, and frequently unwelcoming, environment in which they found themselves.  ABOUT: The Catholic University of America is the national university of the Catholic Church and the only higher education institution founded by the U.S. bishops. Established in 1887 as a papally chartered graduate and research center, the University comprises 12 schools and 31 research facilities and is home to 5,000 undergraduate and graduate students.

The text of the message is as follows:  In the name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful  May 14, 1948 is a reminder of one of the most painful tragedies in human history. This ominous phenomenon caused the longest and saddest political and human crisis in the last one hundred years in the world and widespread insecurity in the West Asian region, the organized occupation and cruel usurpation of the Palestinian land, the killing of the oppressed Palestinians and the violation of the most obvious human rights of the original inhabitants of this holy land in 75 years.  Since the day that has been rightly named ""Nakba Day"", the Zionist regime has caused the displacement of millions of Palestinians, the targeted assassinations of Palestinian activists and ordinary people, the destruction of their homes, farms, and places of business and the violation of fundamental principles of international law, and it is obvious that the western supporters of this regime, especially the United States of America, are complicit in its crimes.  The Zionist regime continues its extreme and inhumane actions against the Palestinian people in the West Bank and the desecration of Islamic sanctities in the holy Quds in recent months, and in recent days, with a large-scale attack on various areas of the Gaza Strip, especially residential buildings, and targeted assassination of Palestinian citizens to escape from increasing and multi-layered internal crises.  These crimes, which have led to the martyrdom of dozens of civilians, including Palestinian women and children, are the concrete manifestation of state terrorism and mass murder, which has been the constant approach of this regime for the past 75 years.  For more than 18 years, the residents of the Gaza Strip have been living in the world's largest natural prison under cruel siege in a major humanitarian crisis. The continuation of the illegal and inhumane siege of the Gaza Strip and the ongoing crimes of the Zionist regime against the people of this region is a gross and obvious violation of the fundamental principles of international law, human rights and humanitarian rights, and unfortunately, the silence and inaction of the self-proclaimed human rights activists only lead to the arrogance of more than apartheid regime has been done before.  While strongly condemning the crimes of the Zionist apartheid regime against the Palestinian nation and the nations of the region, and while emphasizing the need for immediate, effective and deterrent action by the responsible international institutions, led by the United Nations, to stop the crimes of the Zionist regime and support the Palestinian nation, the Islamic Republic of Iran reiterates its solidity with this oppressed nation and emphasizes on supporting the cause and legitimate resistance of the Palestinian people in the path of liberating the occupied territories and forming an independent and unified government in the entire historical land of Palestine with the capital of the holy Quds.  At the end, I re-emphasize the Islamic Republic of Iran's democratic plan for the political solution of the Palestinian occupation crisis based on holding a public referendum with the participation of all the main inhabitants of the Palestinian land, including Muslims, Christians and Jews, in order to exercise the right to self-determination and to determine the type of political system."

Flower children of the '60s on campus were changing the world with long hair and free spirits. They were the populous, rebellious Baby Boomers, born in post-World War II security and prosperity. The sun shone brightly on this huge wave, and they got all the attention.  As for us, born in the '60s, we were not so blessed. Even those born during President John F. Kennedy's Thousand Days don't remember the charmed ""Camelot"" era of culture and grace. That was a short chapter of history.  So, we didn't march on the streets as a way of life. We missed dancing on the streets in the Summer of Love. More soberly, youths coming of age were not drafted to fight in Vietnam as the war raged.  ""Gen X"" was too young to remember the crushing assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963, the central crack in the canyon of American memory.  There are differing definitions of the end of the Boomers; that is my lived experience of the gulf separating the earlier generation and mine.  Unifying experiences, sweet and bitter, shape the character of any generation.  As little kids, we didn't go to Woodstock. It was past our bedtime. The man landing on the moon seemed like a fairy tale, a perfect end to a turbulent time of our lives.  Every new day seemed exhilarating or tragic in that eventful decade. American children could not seek shelter from the storms of the '60s.  How I remember the ride's ups and downs: the rock 'n' roll of the Beatles, the folk protest songs of Bob Dylan and the shattering assassinations in 1968, 55 springs ago.  And I remember crying myself to sleep as a small child when the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., was slain in cold blood. Listening to the civil rights leader's resonant voice on the radio that cruel April fourth, how wrong it was that it would be heard no more.  I remember my father frozen in grief at the June murder of Bobby Kennedy that same spring. A young girl realizes, from reading older faces, that a calamity has happened — again.  There was no nursery rhyme or reason, Mommy and Daddy. They were helpers, I said.  The '60s had many moments like these as the Vietnam War went on... and on. Truly, it was all the adults talked and argued about. In Madison, Wisconsin, we bundled up for an anti-war protest or two. We sang a civil rights anthem or two.  I loved those songs and still know them by heart. Where have all the flowers gone?  As a family, we got caught up in the spirit of the '60s. We watched and trusted Walter Cronkite as the nation's storyteller. When Cronkite turned against President Lyndon B. Johnson's Vietnam War, here was one more trusted grown-up who doubted official Washington's words and actions on the war.  They could not all be wrong, right?  The end of the era gave us children in the '60s a badge as the first generation to watch and bear witness to a culture revolution against the government and social conventions.  The Baby Boomers, who grew up in the safe, conformist Eisenhower '50s, defied traditional authority as children of the '60s. They had all the fun, sometimes it seemed, and those were the days.  That generation gave us three presidents: Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and, um, Donald Trump. Two out of three Baby Bummers.  We children in the '60s have had one president, Barack Obama, born the summer of '61 during Kennedy's Thousand Days. He was better at brilliant campaigning in soaring speeches than governing, playing the card game of politics.  Obama felt getting knee deep in political bargains and compromises was slumming. He shunned the usual suspects — like House Democrats — in socializing at the White House. He did not ask citizens to do more for the country, as Kennedy did.  When we were getting braces, a president was forced to resign in 1974 after a corrupt cover-up. Our faith in government was further shaken.  I'd say Obama didn't meet great expectations. But then there's this: We lost our illusions and innocence young, even before we could vote.  Jamie Stiehm may be reached at JamieStiehm.com. Follow her on Twitter @JamieStiehm.

The groundbreaking commemorated a historic past and a future to become the dream today and tomorrow. The turn of the shovel is for the museum’s new Legacy Building and Founders Park renovations.  “Today is a momentous day at the National Civil Rights Museum for Memphis and for the state of Tennessee and for this country,” said Russ Wigginton, President of the National Civil Right Museum. “The renovations at Founders Park and the Legacy Building sets us up to be much more powerful in our messaging, many more educational opportunities for our visitors, and an opportunity for people to come to the National Civil Rights Museum and be inspired.”  The two-year project will focus on the museum’s campus west of Mulberry Street. It will expand the first floor of the historic boarding house including digital exhibitions and exhibits on Dr. King’s Poor People’s Campaign and the Freedom Award.  “We’ve (Blue Cross Blue Shield) invested 9.6 million dollars to reimagine this space for people to be able to come and reflect after visiting the museum. It’ll be an amazing space not just for Memphians, but people across the country,” said Kevin Woods, Blue Cross Blue Shield Vice President for the Memphis market.  The second-floor exhibitions will explore the Civil Rights Movement since Dr. King’s assassination and what has happened since those days.  “The legacy building will help address that. It will be thematic. It will talk about social justice issues that were central to Dr. King’s last “Where Do We Go From Here (book),” said Wigginton.  The third-floor exhibitions will examine how today’s activism impacts our communities and policies around poverty, education, jobs, housing, criminal justice, and gender equality as the National Civil Rights Museum looks back at the issues of the past and today.  “This museum will continue its critical role to tell our history, to inspire positive social change, and to give us all that special space,” said Blue Cross Blue Shield Board Chair Emily Reynolds.  The National Civil Rights Museum opened in 1991. It’s had more than 300,000 visitors and now expects the expansion in 2025 will mean half a million people visiting the museum every year."

All I can say is that we will not back down from this policy, but we will implement it at the appropriate time,” he added.  Netanyahu’s comments come despite the fact that Israel was said to have agreed to the resistance’s main term for the ceasefire announced on Saturday evening, an end to the Israeli ‘assassination policy’ against leaders of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) movement and other groups.  However, contradicting the alleged Egyptian, Qatari, and UN-drafted truce document – Israeli officials continue to claim that they made no such agreement.  “We will have zero tolerance for those who launch attacks against [us] … we will take direct and very painful measures directly against the heads of all organizations,” Netanyahu said.  Earlier on Monday, a member of Netanyahu’s government, Intelligence Minister Yisrael Katz, said: “The march of the flags will take place, as usual, every year without change, and that any organization that tries to harm it and fire missiles at us to prevent it, all its leaders will be on the elimination table, as we did with Islamic Jihad.”  This came after Palestinian sources told Al-Akhbar daily that – while a change in the course of the flag march was not included in the ceasefire terms as the PIJ had initially announced – the resistance would be keeping a watchful eye over Jerusalem and would respond appropriately to any provocation by “the occupation government and its extremists” during the flag march.  A journalist with close ties to Hamas, Mustafa al-Sawwaf, told Al-Akhbar that “things will turn upside down” if Israel goes ahead with Thursday’s ultra-nationalist march as planned.  Every year, the flag march falls on ‘Jerusalem Day,’ during which Israelis commemorate the illegal annexation of east Jerusalem during the 1967 war. The march is highly provocative given that it passes through the Muslim quarters of Jerusalem’s Old City where Al-Aqsa Mosque compound is located – with Israelis carrying their flags and chanting racist and derogatory slogans.  Acts of violence against Palestinians by settlers and accompanying Israeli troops are highly common throughout the annual flag march. During last year’s flag march, over 160 Palestinians were injured by Israeli troops and settlers.  Israel’s National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir – known for storming Al-Aqsa Mosque and aiming pistols at Palestinians in the street – will be attending the flag march."

May 16, 2023  People hold a banner during a sit-in, in the memory of Emanuela Orlandi, a teenager who disappeared in 1983 in one of Italy's darkest mysteries, behind St Peter's Square in the Vatican in Rome on Jan. 14. (Photo AFP)    ROME: Rome prosecutors have opened a fresh investigation into the disappearance of a teenager 40 years ago, and are calling for full collaboration from the Vatican, Italian media reported Monday.    Emanuela Orlandi, the 15-year-old daughter of a Vatican employee, was last seen leaving a music class in Rome on June 22, 1983.    Decades of speculation followed over what happened to her, with suggestions that mobsters, the secret services or a Vatican conspiracy were to blame, theories which sparked a hit Netflix series.    The Orlandi family's lawyer Laura Sgro told AFP Monday she had learned of the fresh probe through Italian media reports, and ""it would certainly be welcome news"".    The family has campaigned tirelessly for the truth, and it was their demands which led in part to the Vatican launching an inquiry into its most famous cold case in January.    Following that, ""Rome Public Prosecutor's Office is now also formally returning to investigate the Orlandi case,"" Italy's Corriere della Sera said.    It will be the third investigation by the Rome office, following ones from 1983-1997, and 2008- 2015.    'Seek the truth together'  The Vatican has been accused of obstructing investigation efforts over the decades.    But now its chief prosecutor Alessandro Diddi and Rome prosecutors led by Francesco Lo Voi ""are cooperating on the case"", the Repubblica daily said.    The Corriere said ""the hope is for 'full cooperation' -- an exchange of documents, depositions etc"".    The Vatican has interviewed clerics in recent weeks as part of its investigation, the paper added.    It would be ""the first time Italian and Vatican prosecutors work together to seek the truth"", Sgro said.    The fresh Italian investigation was driven in part by former prosecutor Giancarlo Capaldo's claims that he had spoken during the last probe to two representatives at the Vatican who had promised to reveal the whereabouts of Orlandi's body, the Corriere said.    One of the most widely circulated theories claims Orlandi was snatched by mobsters to put pressure on the Vatican to recover a loan.    Enrico De Pedis, head of the Magliana gang, was suspected of involvement in her kidnapping.    Another claim often repeated in the Italian media was that she was taken to force the release from prison of Mehmet Ali Agca, the Turk who attempted to assassinate Pope John Paul II in 1981.    The twists and turns of the case were documented in a 2022 TV series by Netflix, ""Vatican Girl"".    In it, a friend also claimed the teen confided the week before she disappeared to having been harassed in the Vatican gardens by a figure close to then pope John Paul II.--ucanews.com"

(Credit: AP Photo.)  Listen to this story:  ROME – After the Vatican opened an investigation last December and the Italian parliament is currently considering its own probe, the city of Rome too has announced a new inquest into the 1983 disappearance of Emanuela Orlandi, at the time the 15-year-old daughter of an employee of the Prefecture of the Papal Household whose family lived in a Vatican apartment.  Orlandi’s case recently was popularized by the Netflix series “Vatican Girl,” and most observers credit the flurry of new investigations, at least in part, to the heightened public interest created by the documentary.  The chief prosecutor of Rome, roughly equivalent to a district attorney in the United States, announced the new investigation this week. It will be the third such probe by the Roman procurator’s office in the 40 years since Orlandi disappeared. The first unfolded between 1983 and 1997, and the second from 2008 to 2015.  That second investigation was closed in 2015 by the chief prosecutor of Rome at the time, a veteran Italian jurist named Giuseppe Pignatone, who today serves as the president of the civil tribunal of the Vatican City State.  The Italian news agency Ansa reported Tuesday that the Vatican’s Promoter of Justice, Alessandro Diddi, has turned over files from his investigation to Stefano Luciani, the official in the Rome procurator’s office now responsible for the new Orlandi review.  Pietro Orlandi, the brother of Emanuela who’s devoted his life to the search for the truth about his sister’s disappearance, told reporters the Vatican’s cooperation with the Roman probe is a departure from the past.  “It’s positive that the Roman procurator has acquired the acts from the Vatican, because for the first time there will be collaboration, always denied in the past, between the Holy See and the [Italian justice system],” he said.  That’s a charge recently echoed by Giancarlo Capaldo, a retired Roman official who led the last investigation of the Orlandi case that was closed in 2015. In April, Capaldo told an Italian television program that in his experience there had been “no cooperation by Vatican with investigations of Italian magistrates.”  Among other things, Capaldo has claimed that in 2012 officials of the Vatican gendarmes offered to help identify Orlandi’s remains in exchange for assistance with removing the body of a mob boss who’d been entombed in a Roman basilica. Both officials involved have denied that claim, suggesting Capaldo misunderstood their intent.  The Vatican has always rejected charges of stonewalling investigations into the Orlandi case. In a 2012 statement from then-Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi, he insisted the Vatican has cooperated with Italian authorities from the start.  The 40th anniversary of Orlandi’s disappearance will fall next month, on June 22.  Veteran Italian journalist Fabrizio Peronaci, writing in Corriere della Sera, has suggested that the new probe of the Orlandi case by the procurator’s office could be combined with one already underway into the January 1984 murder of Katy Skerl, a 17-year-old girl at the time whose body was discovered in the countryside outside Grottaferrata, a small community southeast of Rome.  Over the years, some theorists have linked Skerl’s murder to the Orlandi case, noting, among other things, that Skerl was a classmate in a Roman high school of Snejna Vassilev, the daughter of one of three Bulgarian functionaries in Rome initially accused of complicity in the 1981 assassination attempt against Pope John Paul II.  Marco Accetti, a 67-year-old Roman photographer whose claims to have played a key role in the Orlandi affair have generated both interest and skepticism over the years, has asserted Skerl was killed on the order of a faction in the Vatican, opposed to the group which orchestrated the kidnapping of Orlandi, as part of an internal power struggle. To date, however, he’s offered no proof.  The Italian Chamber of Deputies voted overwhelmingly in March to authorize an inquest on behalf of parliament, and it seemed at the time the Senate would follow suit. Momentum stalled, however, after Pietro Orlandi went on Italian TV to play an audio recording of an ex-Roman mobster accusing the late Pope John Paul II of conniving in a pedophile ring in the Vatican, and suggesting that Emanuela Orlandi might have been killed to cover it up.  Those suggestions caused a furor, with Pope Francis twice publicly rejecting the charges against his predecessor. Key members of the senate have either withdrawn or modified their support for a probe in the wake of the controversy, with a vote now not expected until June at the earliest, and possibly after the summer."

Truman Moore/Getty Images  May 2023 marks 98 years since the birth of civil rights leader Malcolm X, formerly Malcolm Little.  Malcolm X was a spokesperson for the Nation of Islam, or NOI, and helped to lead the organization until he left in 1964 – the year before his assassination.  The NOI, whose role in civil rights movements is a focus of my research, included leaders such as Elijah Muhammad and Louis Farrakhan, who along with Malcolm X are known for their fiery rhetoric and teachings on race.  The NOI, which teaches a Black supremacist message and advocates for racial separatism, has also been labeled a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.  While the organization once boasted half a million members, the group is now relatively small. Currently it has an estimated membership of roughly 35,000 – but prominent NOI members, such as boxer and onetime Malcolm X friend Muhammad Ali, attracted wide public interest in the movement. Today, its influence continues to extend well beyond its membership.  Although Malcolm X – and other prominent members like Ali – left the NOI, thousands of students each year learn about the group from Malcolm X’s “Autobiography,” originally published in 1965.  Malcolm X’s influence on popular culture also remains significant. He inspired a Hollywood biopic and is referenced in the work of artists such as Beyoncé, Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg, who was briefly associated with NOI.  Thanks largely to Malcolm X, the NOI is now a household name, but its teachings remain controversial, particularly among Muslims.  A radical alternative to Christianity?  W.D. Fard, a peddler by day and preacher by night, established the NOI in 1931 in Detroit, Michigan.  He taught that God was a Black man who taught the first human beings Islam. Accordingly, Fard framed Islam as “the natural faith” for people whose ancestors came from Africa, before colonization and slavery had forced Christianity onto them. He argued that Black people should abandon Christianity in favor of Islam as their ancestral religion.  Story continues  Fard also taught that Christianity was “the white man’s” religion and a corrupted form of Islam used to promote white supremacy. The message appealed to Black migrants from the South, who were sometimes looked down upon by Northern Black Protestants. Fard disappeared from the historical record in the mid-1930s.  Malcolm X and the NOI  Malcolm X joined the NOI while incarcerated in 1952. He became an international spokesman for the group, using his fierce wit and sense of humor to debate Black and white leaders on matters of race, religion and politics.  Malcolm X was suspended from the NOI in 1963 for his comments about President John F. Kennedy’s assassination. The following year, he renounced the NOI, converted to Sunni Islam, completed the hajj and formed a Black civil rights organization called the Organization of Afro-American Unit, or OAAU. This group sought to unite all Black people across the globe and conditionally accepted help from white people committed to Black freedom. The NOI, on the other hand, focused on the U.S. and refused all help from white Americans.  Malcolm X was assassinated on February 21, 1965, during an OAAU event in New York. The identity of his killers remains a mystery.  A new era  When Elijah Muhammad died in 1975, his son, Warith Deen Mohammed, transformed the NOI into the “World Community of al-Islam in the West.” He downplayed previous teachings about Black supremacy and aligned the movement closer to Sunni Islam. In 1977, however, a protégé of Elijah Muhammad’s and Malcolm X’s named Louis Farrakhan “restored” Elijah Muhammad’s Nation of Islam. Farrakhan assumed leadership of the group and emphasized Elijah’s teachings on race.  W.D. Fard, the NOI’s founder, and his successor Elijah Muhammad did not seem to know much about Sunni or Shiite Islam’s teachings. Fard did not cite the Quran to his followers, and Elijah Muhammad did not read the book until after assuming the NOI’s leadership.  As the group grew after World War II, Muhammad and other leaders became more familiar with mainstream Islamic tenets. They changed the name of their meeting places from “temples” to “mosques” and incorporated the Quran and Arabic phrases into their teachings and community organizing.  While the movement has changed its practices to align more closely with global expressions of Islam, many Muslims do not consider the NOI part of the Ummah, the global community of Muslims.  Not universally considered Muslim  The NOI’s unique theology is one of the reasons the group is not accepted into the Ummah.  Other forms of Islam maintain that God is eternal, nonhuman and singularly divine. The NOI, however, teaches that W.D. Fard was “God in person” who called Elijah Muhammad as his prophet.  Despite this significant deviation from mainstream forms of Islam, the NOI follows four of the five pillars of Islam: five daily prayers (salat), giving alms to the poor (zakat), pilgrimage to Mecca (hajj) and a month of fasting during Ramadan.  NOI Muslims did not practice Ramadan until 1988, when Farrakhan instructed members to fast “with the entire Islamic world.”  Changing attitudes?  That change led to opportunities for intra-Muslim cooperation but also underscored the limited acceptance of the NOI that continues among many other Muslim groups.  For example, in 2000, NOI members prayed with Houston Muslims during Ramadan, allowing the NOI to connect with other American Muslims.  However, these cross-Muslim events have not continued in Houston. Nor are they common elsewhere. The lack of sustained pan-Muslim events might suggest that, even when religious practice aligns, there remain obstacles to the building of relationships between mainstream and NOI Muslims.  While both the NOI and Malcolm X remain controversial, for many admirers X’s work has taken on new significance for today’s racial justice movements.

Shri Rajinder kaul premi, with his eyes moist said that his illustrious father ,& beloved younger married brother verinder(27) were first kidnapped from their residence in the late night of April 28,1990 & latter on assassined ,when their bodies were recovered. Rajinder said that the militant kidnappers looted & ransacked their entire house ,after forcing their entry in their house, on the pretext of asking some questions from the learned teacher, who was so popular in the area, as they meant no harm to this lone pandit, family living in that area ,who according to these militants was helping their muslim neighbours in their hour of need. These terrorist had the sworen in the name of Allah, Quran, Mohamad, Haj, Roza etc only to trap their prey. The promised their family that they will bring back both the father & son duo safely , tomorrow & will love to take tea ,as our commander waiting outside the house has instructed us. On this promise both father & son duo were take with them, along with the looted property viz cash, jewellery watches, precious clothing, pashmina shawals, besides rare books& manuscripts, after packing these in emptied bags & suit case.  Rajinder further said that after painful wait of two days they were informed of the sad occurrences.  Although an FIR 45/90 was registered in police station Doru Anantnag, but this case was closed as untraced after after a brief period, as no effective & expeditious investigation was done, although this case was first of its kind in the area & special case , investigation as expected was not taken up.  This was a severe blow to the belief of the family stood far & only in this back drop the family  migrated from the valley much against their wishes.  A press note issued by the Govt: then said ,”Eight arrests have been made ,suspected to be involved in this case” but latter was closed as untraced, which has further shocked & wrecked the family.  Not only this their ancestral local temple was demolished & desecrated in 1992.  Their native residential houses & cow shed torched in 1998.

Play Video  Teves had been the focus of the government’s joint task force investigating the March 4 assassination of the Negros Oriental governor.    Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin “Boying” Remulla said the NBI filed murder, frustrated murder, and attempted murder complaints against the fugitive congressman.  The 11 other suspects – almost all former members of the military – are in the custody of the NBI.  The filing of the complaint was delayed by two days, after six of the 11 suspects became uncooperative when they were given new lawyers. (READ: Filing of murder complaints vs Teves delayed as suspects get new lawyers)  Teves, who left the country purportedly for medical reasons prior to the assassination, has yet to return to the Philippines long after the March 20 deadline set by House Speaker Martin Romualdez.  Separate from the multiple murder complaint, the Department of Justice earlier said it was in the process of proscribing Teves as a terrorist.  Play Video  Remulla previously said the DOJ received intel that Teves was supposed to return home on Wednesday.  Teves told News 5 earlier on Wednesday that this was “fake news.”  The justice secretary said that if Teves refused to return home, it would be an indication of guilt. “Flight is an indication of guilt, by any language, jurisdiction,” Remulla said.  Whether or not Teves returns home, the preliminary investigation will continue, the secretary explained.  Teves cannot file his counter-affidavit in absentia, but he can be charged in absentia.  “He has to come home, or they will file the case in court, and a warrant will be issued in absentia,” Remulla said.  In reaction to the filing of cases against Teves, his lawyer Ferdie Topacio told CNN Philippines, “it’s about time.”  “Kung ang sinasabi ni Secretary Remulla gusto niyang airtight, lalo hindi naging airtight. Kasi, nabalitaan ko nga through various news outlets, meron recantation ang thrust ng ilang sinasabi nilang testigo nung March 31 pa. Sinasabi nila 99.9% solved. Pagdating ng April 4, sabi nila solid daw ang testimonial evidence against Congressman Teves, ayan, may mga recantations pala,” Topacio said, casting doubt on the DOJ’s case build-up.  (If Secretary Remulla is saying they waited so long to make the case airtight, the more it isn’t airtight. Because we found out through various news outlets, there was a thrust toward recantations, from witnesses they said who testified last March 31. They said it is 99.9% solved. Then came April 4, they said the testimonial evidence against them was solid, but there are recantations.)  Why it matters  While political killings continue to happen in the Philippines, it’s rare that a sitting governor is assassinated in broad daylight in his own home by what appears to be highly trained gunmen.  Aside from the method in Degamo’s killing, there were nine others killed and 16 injured that day – all civilians. Another civilian died on May 6, bringing the death toll to 10.  Degamo’s killing also brought national attention to the long-running problem of unsolved killings in Negros Island. It has stirred conversations on ending impunity and protecting human rights in Negros Oriental, issues that were rarely talked about in the province.  The Senate committee on dangerous drugs and public order held marathon hearings to investigate the Degamo assassination and other killings in Negros Oriental from April 17 to 19, and from May 10 to 11. They heard dozens of families of victims of unsolved killings, survivors, and cops who were used to be assigned to or currently serving in Negros Oriental.  The Senate investigation concluded on May 11 after five sessions. – Rappler.com"

Advertising Read more  Some 24,000 security personnel are reportedly being deployed to Hiroshima during the summit, most dispatched from other parts of the country.  Well ahead of the May 19-21 talks, patrolling police have been weaving between tour groups in the western city's famed Peace Park.  Security personnel were also motoring up and down the river that runs alongside sites like the Atomic Bomb Dome, with helicopters regularly buzzing overhead.  The measures have extended far beyond the city, including to the capital Tokyo, where messages on the train system warn of heightened security for the summit.  Major cities in Japan do not generally have rubbish bins in public places, but security personnel have been sealing off other places considered to pose a potential threat.  Coin lockers, which are common in many stations, have been put out of operation at major stations as far afield as Tokyo.  Security personnel are even patrolling by boat in Hiroshima before the G7 summit © Richard A. Brooks / AFP  Vending machines on subway platforms have also been unplugged and sealed with tape, along with apologetic signs warning they will be unavailable during the summit for security reasons.  In Hiroshima, signs across the city and in hotels remind locals and tourists alike that the summit will cause disruption, including the closure of streets and access to the island of Miyajima, which leaders are expected to visit.  'Inconvenience understandable'  Dozens of schools and other institutions have simply opted to close during the summit, according to local media.  But Yoshinari Kakei, who was out walking his dog in the Peace Park early Wednesday evening said he was ""grateful"" for the heavy security.  ""Inconvenience and limitations are understandable. We will just live with that during this period,"" the 52-year-old told AFP.  The measures are likely to be closely scrutinised less than a year after a gunman assassinated former prime minister Abe as he campaigned in the city of Nara.  Then in April, a man hurled an explosive device towards Prime Minister Fumio Kishida shortly before he was due to deliver a campaign speech in the city of Wakayama.  Police are patrolling across the city, which is expecting major disruptions while leaders are in town © Philip FONG / AFP  He escaped unharmed, but the fact that an assailant was able to throw the device at such close range so soon after the Abe murder prompted renewed criticism of security arrangements in Japan.  The head of Japan's National Police Agency, and the local police chief, resigned in the wake of Abe's assassination after an investigation confirmed ""shortcomings"" in the security for the former leader.  The investigation slammed a system under which local police were given responsibility for the security of visiting senior officials and argued that with better measures, it was ""highly probable"" the attack could have been prevented.  Kishida has instructed police to step up security around the G7 ""so that guests can visit Japan with peace of mind"".

Former paramilitary leader Salvatore Mancuso made the revelations during his testimony to Colombia’s Special Jurisdiction for Peace on Thursday.  “At one point a Venezuelan general came along with his son and some Venezuelan politicians to propose Carlos Castaño and I [...] that we carry out a coup d'état with a part of the Venezuelan Armed Forces allied with us to overthrow and assassinate Hugo Chávez,” Mancuso told the tribunal.  Mancuso, together with Carlos Castaño, led the the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC by its Spanish acronym), a former paramilitary group with ties to the Colombian Armed Forces that fought the country’s guerrilla armies, waging a violent campaign in the countryside that claimed thousands of victims.  The paramilitary chief was testifying before the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP by its Spanish acronym), a tribunal established as part of a peace agreement between the Colombian state and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) in 2016. Mancuso delivered his testimony via video from a prison inside the United States after being extradited in 2008 to face drug trafficking charges.  Mancuso, who seeks to return to Colombia, faces a long series of serious charges related to his time as a leader of the AUC. People involved in the country’s decades-long armed conflict who participate in JEP tribunals are eligible to receive special consideration, including reduced sentences, if their testimony is found to be truthful.  The work of the Special Jurisdiction for Peace has grown in prominence as Colombian President Gustavo Petro seeks to implement what his government has termed “Total Peace” in the country after his conservative predecessor deliberately sidelined peace efforts. The AUC itself formally demobilized between 2003 and 2006 as part of a separate deal promoted by former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe, which was criticized for being too accommodating to the paramilitary groups and leaders.  In his testimony to the JEP, Mancuso added that Castaño rejected the Venezuelan opposition proposal but nonetheless offered to send AUC troops to train their Venezuelan counterparts to carry out the coup. In 2004, a group of 50 Colombian paramilitaries was caught in an estate outside Caracas with an alleged plot to assassinate Chávez, who was elected in 1998 and served as president until his death from cancer in 2013.  Mancuso’s claim bolsters accusations of collaboration and coordination between Venezuela’s hardline opposition and paramilitary groups on both sides of the border. Self-proclaimed former “interim president” Juan Guaidó and his allies faced heavy criticism after photos emerged of the opposition figure embracing high ranking members of Colombia’s Los Rastrojos after he crossed from Venezuela into Colombia to participate in US-led effort to force “humanitarian aid” across the border in 2019.  Former US National Security Advisor John Bolton later revealed that the so-called aid scheme was indeed an effort to try to embarrass Maduro and trigger a break in the armed forces, as Venezuelan government officials had denounced.  Guaidó again illegally entered Colombia last month as part of an effort to sabotage an international conference on Venezuela hosted by Petro. It was not clear if he relied on the help of armed actors in the border region once more. Guaidó eventually fled Colombia for Miami and subsequently held meetings with US politicians from both sides of the aisle who reiterated their support for him and Venezuela’s hardline opposition.  Petro has similarly denounced a coup plot by former Colombian security officials, mercenaries and paramilitary outfits. Retired state security officials and reservists staged a protest against the Colombian president’s security policies last Wednesday, with some openly calling for his ouster. Human rights activists in Colombia have long denounced the closeness between Colombian state security forces and paramilitary outfits.  Colombian mercenaries are also accused of involvement in the 2021 assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moïse, with 18 Colombians, many of them former soldiers, having been arrested in connection with Moïse’s killing. The assassination is suspected of being organized with the help of a Florida-based security firm.  In 2020, Venezuela foiled an effort by a 60-man paramilitary force organized by US special operations veteran Jordan Goudreau and retired Venezuelan Major General Cliver Alcalá to infiltrate the country via Colombia with the aim of assassinating Maduro.  The plot, known as “Operation Gideon”, counted on the support and blessing of high-profile Venezuelan opposition figures, despite denials from Guaidó. Goudreau has produced evidence showing the opposition hired his Florida-based security company Silvercorp and has sued anti-government operators for breach of contract.  Mancuso additionally testified that the AUC buried at least 200 bodies in mass graves inside Venezuelan territory in the early 2000s. The former paramilitary chief said that practice emerged after communities inside Colombia started to speak out against the incineration of victims in crematoriums as part of an effort to disappear bodies. Following Mancuso’s claims, Colombia and Venezuela announced that the two countries had agreed to “immediately” work together to help find the remains.  Edited by Ricardo Vaz in Caracas."

Addressing a press conference on Tuesday ADGP R K Swain said that out of 4 accused involved in the assassination of Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, two were killed in the encounters and two others on the run were arrested and handed over to CBI who will now face trial.  He identified the two arrested accused as Javaid Ahmed Bhat alias late Habibullah, a resident of Solina, presently living at Azad Basti Natipora and Zahoor Ahmed Bhat son of Muhammad Ramzan, of Dandarkha Batamaloo.  “Four persons were involved in the killing. All the four were run. Two accused Abdullah Bangroo and Rehman Shigan were killed in the encounter. The two other accused Javaid and Zahoor went to Pakistan and then Nepal and were finally arrested and handed over to CBI and now they will face the trial,” he said adding that Zahoor was the main accused.  He said one accused Ayoub Dar has been already facing conviction in this case registered at Police Station Nigeen and then the same case was handed over to CBI. “His conviction was challenged in the Supreme Court but the court upheld the conviction.”  Meanwhile, police have issued a detailed press statement claiming that SIA of J&K Police has tracked & arrested two absconding militants involved in killing of Mirwaiz Farooq and both the militants have been handed over to CBI to face trial.    Police said that 5 militants were involved in the killing. Abdullah Bangroo & Rehman Shigan had got killed in encounters and couldn’t face trial. Ayub Dar underwent trial and convicted for life, currently serving sentence in Srinagar central jail. Javaid Bhat & Zahoor Bhat were absconding and hence escaped trial and they both have been apprehended. The duo had gone underground and during all these years were variously hiding in Nepal and Pakistan among other places before surreptitiously returning back to Kashmir a few years ago. Maintaining a low profile, changing addresses and shifting residences, they avoided the gaze of law enforcement agencies.  Accused in CBI case RC0501990S008 (pertaining to killing of Mirwaiz Farooq) they are now liable to immediately face trial in a designated TADA court in Delhi which has already completed the trial in respect of one of the five accused namely Ayub Dar code Ishfaq son of Late Abdul Ahad Dar of Rawalpora of Srinagar who has been convicted and serving a life sentence. Two other absconding accused found guilty in the killing of Mirwaiz, Abdullah Bangroo and Abdul Rehman Shigan, got killed in encounters with security forces in the 1990s.  According to police statement, on 21 May 1990, Mirwaiz Farooq, the head priest of Kashmir was killed by militants of Hizbul Mujahideen accusing him of being a ‘peacenik’ and an ‘Indian agent’.  Case FIR No 61/1990 came to be registered in Police Station Nageen, Srinagar to investigate the crime. Thereafter the government of the day transferred the investigation to CBI on 11 June 1990.  After a long and arduous legal process of investigation and prosecution, the designated TADA court, in 2009, convicted the only arrested accused Ayub Dar for life. The remaining four remained on run. While two (Abdullah Bangroo & Rehman Shigan) died in encounters, Javaid Bhat and Ayub Bhat managed to evade arrest.    Ayub Dar, the convicted militant and one of the killers appealed against his conviction, which however, was upheld by the Division Bench of Supreme Court in Criminal Appeal No.535 of 2009 on 21 July 2010.  Before killing Mirwaiz, all the five HM militants had gone to Pakistan for militant training in 1990. Back in Srinagar, Abdullah Bangroo received instructions in April 1990 from his ISI handler in Pakistan to eliminate Mirwaiz.    Paraphrased excerpts from Supreme Court order:  In the year 1990 itself, in the month of April, accused Abdullah Bangroo, Javed Ahmed Bhat alias Ajmal Khan and Mohd. Ayub Dar alias Ishfaq, who belongs to Hizbul Mujahideen, entered into a criminal conspiracy to eliminate Mirwaiz Moulvi Farooq. Accused Abdulla Bangroo, who was then heading Hizbul Mujahideen, instructed Javed Ahmed Bhat alias Ajmal Khan and Mohd. Ayub Dar alias Ishfaq to plan elimination of Mirwaiz Moulvi Farooq. Javed Ahmed Bhat alias Ajmal Khan was then working as an Area Commander of Hizbul-Mujahideen in the downtown area of Srinagar; whereas the Javed was working as a Group Commander in that very area. Later on, Abdul Rehman Shigan alias Inayat and Zahoor Ahmed alias Bilal also joined the conspiracy. It came out in the investigation that, in the second week of May, 1990, under the instructions of Javed Ahmed Bhat alias Ajmal Khan, Mohd. Ayub Dar alias Ishfaq and Abdul Rehman Shigan alias Inayat had visited the residence of Moulvi Farooq at Nageen, Srinagar and had requested him for financial help to their militant organization i.e. Hizbul Mujahideen. Moulvi Farooq had agreed to help them and had asked them to meet after 2/3 days during the morning hours. Thereafter, two accused surveyed the area as per their plan and informed the details to Javed Ahmed Bhat alias Ajmal Khan. It was on 21.05.1990 that the three accused namely Mohd Ayub Dar alias Ishfaq , Abdul Rehman Shingan alias Inayat and Zahoor Ahmed alias Bilal alias Jana armed with loaded pistol visited the `Mirwaiz Manzil’ at Nageen. Accused Javed Ahmed Bhat alias Bilal had instructed the appellant that, out of the three accused persons, Zahoor Ahmed alias Bilal would fire on Moulvi Farooq and the remaining two accused persons namely Ayub Dar and Abdul Rehman Shingan were to provide cover to Zahoor Ahmed alias Bilal.  As per the plan, they all reached the gate of Mirwaiz Manzil and met Maqbool Shah, the gate-keeper and informed him that they wanted to meet Moulvi Farooq. Maqbool Shah then asked Gulam Qadir Sofi, the gardener, to take them to the Personal Assistant as he himself was going to the market.  Accordingly, the gardener – Ghulam Qadir Sofi took the three to the Personal Assistant namely Saidur Rehman , who asked them about their names and one of them disclosed his fake name as Gulzar Farooq R/o. Batmaloo. That name was written by the Personal Assistant on a slip of paper and the said slip was sent inside the room of Moulvi Farooq through the gardener Ghulam Qadir Sofi. After sometime, Moulvi Farooq called the three accused inside the Office, on which Zahoor Ahmed alias Bilal entered the room of Moulvi Farooq and the remaining two accused persons including Javed Bhat took position in the PA’s room. On entering the room of Moulvi Farooq, Zahoor Ahmed alias Bilal fired several rounds on Moulvi Farooq from his pistol and immediately, accused Inayat also fired from his pistol in the air while coming out of PA’s room, which hit the outside wall of the Office. On hearing the sound of firing, the gardener came inside the Office and tried to catch hold of Ishfaq, who was trying to escape.  However, all the accused persons escaped giving a push to the Gardener Ghulam Qadir Sofi. Accused Bilal also tried to run away, but he was caught by Ghulam Qadir Sofi. There was a scuffle between the two, in which Bilal sustained an injury below his right eye. Later, after firing one round from his pistol, Bilal also managed to escape. The accused persons ran towards Kashmir University, who were followed by Ghulam Qadir Sofi upto the main road and near the University Gate, the assailants ran towards Soura through the University compound and reached Chatargam in the afternoon of 21.05.1990. They then reported killing of Moulvi Farooq to Abdulla Bangroo. All the three accused persons were directed by Abdullah Bangroo, to go underground for sometime.  During trail running for several years, it could be established that the militant who pulled the trigger on Mirwaiz Farooq on the fateful day on the directions of then HM commander Abdullah Bangroo was Zahoor Bhat who ironically succeeded in evading arrest by going into hiding."

Kennedy.  “I released a lot, as you know. And I will release everything else,” former Trump said of the JFK files, in an interview Monday with The Messenger.  This comes after Robert F. Kennedy Jr., nephew of the late President Kennedy, blamed the CIA for his uncle’s assassination in 1963.  The Democratic presidential candidate made the controversial remarks during an interview with John Catsimatidis on his WABC 770 AM show Cats Roundtable in early May.  “I think there is overwhelming evidence that the CIA was involved in his murder,” Kennedy said.  “I think it’s beyond reasonable doubt at this point,” he said. “The evidence is overwhelming that the CIA was involved in the murder and in the cover-up.”  The President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 states that government records concerning the death of JFK “should be eventually disclosed to enable the public to become fully informed about the history surrounding the assassination.”  During Trump’s time in office, he released some documents but not all the records.  In a statement released in 2018, Trump said, “I agree with the Archivist’s recommendation that the continued withholdings are necessary to protect against identifiable harm to national security, law enforcement, or foreign affairs that is of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest in immediate disclosure.”  “I am also ordering agencies to re-review each of those redactions over the next three years,” he said.  About 4,300 records remain redacted, according to the CIA.  When interviewed by The Messenger, Trump was asked about whether the public has anything to worry about if the records harm America’s international reputation.  “Well, I don’t want to comment on that. But I will tell you that I have released a lot. I will release the remaining portion very early in my term,” Trump said.  Kennedy Jr. filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to run as a Democratic candidate for president in April."

The ordeal occurred amid tensions and dialogue between the two main Kurdish parties in northern Iraq.  What happened: Karwan Gaznay, a member of the Kurdistan parliament for the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), said in a tweet on Tuesday that he ""survived an assassination attempt” the night prior. His driver was injured and they are “waiting for the reaction of the government,” per the tweet.  The incident took place in the town of Koya located in Erbil province. It is under investigation, according to the PUK-affiliated Esta news agency.  The Kurdish news outlet NRT, which is affiliated with the opposition New Generation party, reported that the shooting occurred around 10 p.m. local time on Monday at a checkpoint manned by Kurdish internal security forces known as Asayish.    NRT later reported on Wednesday that Zana Khalid, a commander in the region's peshmerga forces, disputed Gaznay's account of the incident. Khalid, an affiliate of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), said the confrontation occurred when Gaznay's vehicle crashed into his own vehicle and Gaznay's driver began hurling insults.  Sulaimaniyah province is controlled by the PUK, while Erbil province is controlled by the KDP. The KDP is the largest party in the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), followed by the PUK. Koya, where the shooting occurred, is close to the border separating the two parties’ territories.  Why it matters: The shooting occurred at a time of significant tensions between the KDP and the PUK. Tensions between the two parties are not new but were raised significantly in October when PUK counterterrorism officer Hawkar Jaf was killed in a car bombing in Erbil.  The current tensions have multiple dimensions. One area where the two parties disagree is over energy policy, specifically the KRG’s independent oil exports, according to Aras Masifi, an independent Kurdish blogger.  “The PUK believes it has had little say and involvement in the KRG's oil policy in recent years,” Masifi told Al-Monitor. “That is why the PUK advocates a common uniform energy policy with Baghdad in the hope of being able to have more say and participation in Baghdad.”  The tensions over oil have worsened since the March decision by the Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce that ruled Turkey had to pay damages to Iraq for accepting unauthorized oil imports from the Kurdistan Region. The decision relates to the Baghdad-based federal government’s efforts to exert its authority over the KRG’s independent oil sector. Much of the region’s oil is in KDP territory.  “Especially after the Paris court decision, the PUK has become louder and clearer in its pro-Baghdad rhetoric,” said Masifi.  The KDP currently holds the positions of prime minister and president in the KRG, while senior PUK member Qubad Talabani is deputy prime minister. The tensions also relate to the division of power within the KRG, according to Masifi.  “(Talabani) believes he has little power to fill government posts. But the PUK would also like more autonomy from the KDP/Erbil when it comes to the budget and procurement law for large construction projects,” he said.  The two parties have also been fighting over the region’s election laws and when to hold parliamentary elections, which are now scheduled to take place in November. PUK officials stopped attending KRG Cabinet meetings last December due to the tensions, according to the KDP-affiliated news outlet Rudaw.  The assassination attempt on Syrian Kurdish leader Mazlum Kobane in Sulaimaniyah last month further exacerbated tensions between the two parties. Kobane blamed Turkey for the attack, though the country denied this. The KDP is historically close to Turkey, while the PUK has good relations with Kobane’s Syrian Democratic Forces, as well as the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). The PUK blamed the KDP for the attack on Kobane, Amberin Zaman reported for Al-Monitor at the time.  The attack on Gaznay is not the first to occur amid these tensions. NRT reported a “noticeable rise” in shootings, kidnappings and physical assaults during the month of April. The outlet pointed to the assault of Erbil-based lawyer Mohammed Sofi and the killing of KDP official Abdullah Kuekha Mubarak’s son, among other incidents.  “Tensions between the two ruling parties of the Kurdistan Region have provided opportunities for some to settle scores, exploiting the deteriorating security situation,” NRT reported.  A particularly high number of political assassinations have occurred in Sulaimaniyah since 2021.  Know more: The intra-Kurdish tensions in Iraq could dissipate soon. On Sunday, PUK ministers returned to the Cabinet meetings. The Cabinet promptly passed a measure to centralize revenues, expenditures and salaries across the region. This had been a demand of the PUK, according to Rudaw.  On Tuesday, PUK and KDP political leaders met again in Sulaimaniyah to discuss the November elections.  Editor's note: this article was updated on May 17, 2023 to include a dispute of Gaznay's assassination attempt claim."

This is the obvious conclusion from all the pride and boasting about the assassination of six top Islamic Jihad commanders. If this is the main accomplishment of Operation Shield and Arrow, then Israeli policy toward the Palestinians, and on Gaza in particular, is in quite a sorry state.  Once upon a time, the defense establishment – the Mossad, Shin Bet and IDF – held an ambivalent attitude toward the use of assassinations as a tool for fighting the enemy, whether enemy countries or terrorist groups, and the tactic was always considered a last resort.  The first targeted assassination was carried out by Israel in 1956, when Unit 154 (today Unit 504) of army intelligence, which ran agents on Israel’s borders, sent a package bomb into Gaza that killed Colonel Mustafa Hafez, an Egyptian intelligence officer who dispatched fedayeen cells into Israel.  In the 1960s, there were several assassination operations by the Mossad – against German scientists who aided Egypt’s armaments program, and against Herberts Cukurs, a Nazi war criminal known as the “Butcher of Riga.” A Mossad cell assassinated him in 1965 in Montevideo, Uruguay.  After the Six-Day War, the intelligence community resumed using targeted assassinations, but only sparingly. The Mossad sent cells of fighters to assassinate Palestinian terrorists in Europe in response to terror attacks against Jewish and Israeli targets abroad, like the murder of the Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972.  In the same era, Shin Bet operatives were operating in the West Bank and Gaza, either directly or indirectly through Palestinian agents. In the 1970s, and to a greater degree following the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, Israel also began assassinating Palestinian and Hezbollah militants.  Open gallery view A child carrying a poster of Hezbollah commander Imad Mughniyeh during his Beirut funeral in 2008. Credit: Reuters  But the big change in the targeted assassination policy came in the wake of the second intifada, when Avi Dichter was leading the Shin Bet. The tactic became very widely used. Hundreds of militants were assassinated by a variety of methods, and the latest technologies were incorporated in the effort – such as drones and, later, suicide drones.  Occasionally, radical proposals were suggested during discussions at the highest political and military levels, such as targeting Iraqi ruler Saddam Hussein for assassination. This was after the 1991 Gulf War in which 39 Scud missiles were fired at Israeli cities. The preparations for this operation, for which Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin likely would not have given final approval in any case, were halted in the wake of the Tze’elim disaster in which five Sayeret Matkal fighters were killed during training for the operation.  But Israel has never determined whether targeted assassinations are an effective policy that serves a worthy purpose, or merely the result of a desire for vengeance. Fifty years ago, after Mossad agents shot and killed a Moroccan waiter in Lillehammer, Norway in a case of mistaken identity, there was urgent discussion in the security establishment about whether the assassination tactic should continue to be used. David Kimche, the future deputy Mossad chief, told me at the time that the Mossad should not be in the business of assassinating enemies because “We’re not a mafia, we’re not Murder, Inc.”  The first and only attempt to seriously address this issue was by a subcommittee of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee following the failed assassination attempt of Hamas official Khaled Meshal in Amman in 1997. Members of the subcommittee that investigated the failed operation included Yossi Sarid, Benny Begin, Ori Orr and Uzi Landau. Much of its report, in which it attempted to formulate something like a “targeted assassinations doctrine” – when, under what circumstances, and against whom this tactic should be used – remains classified.  The committee, as well as outside experts, appear to have basically agreed that assassinations, particularly outside of Israel, are only appropriate in exceptional circumstances. The most prominent example of this is the assassination, attributed to the Mossad and CIA, of Hezbollah “defense minister” Imad Mughniyeh by a car bomb in Damascus in 2008. Since then, Hezbollah has struggled to find a worthy replacement for Mughniyeh, who was considered especially skilled in devising terrorist operations throughout the Middle East, not only against Israeli targets.  In its concluding remarks, the 1997 subcommittee wrote, “Over the years, Israel’s governments have not clearly formulated a policy for combating terrorist organizations that is based on rigorous thought and consistent logic. In the absence of a clear doctrine for anti-terrorist activity, the component of response to terror attacks has taken on great and damaging weight.” Evidently, none of Israel’s governments over the past quarter-century have read this spot-on assessment, or if they did, they immediately forgot it.  One way this may be seen is in the series of assassinations of Iranian nuclear scientists that are attributed to the Mossad since 2009, the most recent being the 2019 assassination of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, Iran’s top nuclear scientist.  But it's even more apparent in the policy Israel has employed in recent years in successive operations in Gaza. From one operation to the next, as Israel’s frustration mounts, so does the blind faith and stagnant thinking that targeted assassinations will solve the problem. For some ministers and security chiefs, targeted assassination have become the ultimate method and a substitute for a real strategy."

Heretofore, that commission had been composed entirely of cardinals. The move complements a similar change Francis made in his new constitution for the Roman Curia last year, which decreed that a lay person, man or woman, can head a curial department. (The Roman Curia assists the pope in governing the universal church, while the Vatican City State administers the pope’s physical territory.)  In that sense, the new fundamental law, which replaces one issued by Pope John Paul II in 2000, is indeed a watershed for the lay role.

""We are here to protest for the rule of law and a non-partisan judiciary.""  There was a heavy security presence in the capital on Monday as protesters gathered outside the court in the capital's so-called red zone.

Analysts say legal hurdles are often used to discourage dissent in Pakistan and Khan dismisses the cases arrayed against him as politically motivated.  Political analyst Mosharraf Zaidi said judges were split down the middle over the political crisis.  ""The judiciary still makes compromises with both civilians and the military, but on many issues judges have repeatedly demonstrated the ability to take a stand and hold their ground,"" he told AFP.  Tussle with military  Former international cricket star Khan returned to the Lahore High Court on Monday, where his lawyers said they were seeking information on fresh cases linking him to the violence that followed his arrest. The case will continue Tuesday.  Khan was accompanied by his wife, Bushra Bibi, who was granted protective bail in the same corruption case that led to the former leader's arrest.  Their team erected a white curtain between their vehicle and the courtroom to shield the couple from the media.  At least nine people were killed, hundreds of police officers injured and more than 7,000 people detained in last week's unrest before Khan was released on bail on Friday, authorities said.  Sanaullah, who has vowed Khan will be rearrested, told reporters on Sunday the ""terrorism and mobbing was all preplanned and this was done by Khan"".  Elections are due no later than October and Khan has held a series of vastly popular marches challenging the authority of the shaky coalition of parties that replaced him.  He has also waged an unprecedented campaign of defiance against Pakistan's army, which has ruled for nearly half of Pakistan's 75-year history and continues to wield massive influence.  When Khan surged into office in 2018, most understood it was with the backing of the generals. Analysts likewise said when he left power it was because he had fallen out of favour with the top brass.  In opposition Khan has made explosive claims about the military's involvement in politics, including that they plotted a November assassination attempt in which he was shot in the leg while campaigning for fresh polls.  His arrest last Tuesday came just hours after he repeated the allegations at a rally.  © 2023 AFP"

Heretofore, that commission had been composed entirely of cardinals. The move complements a similar change Francis made in his new constitution for the Roman Curia last year, which decreed that a lay person, man or woman, can head a curial department. (The Roman Curia assists the pope in governing the universal church, while the Vatican City State administers the pope’s physical territory.)  In that sense, the new fundamental law, which replaces one issued by Pope John Paul II in 2000, is indeed a watershed for the lay role. In this case, however, it’s probably one which should also come with a warning.  As opposed to the Roman Curia, it’s hardly a novelty for laity to have a share in governing the pope’s physical territory. During the era of the Papal States, when popes ruled over a swath of central Italy as a temporal monarch, the head of government nominally was always the Cardinal Secretary of State, but the pope generally would appoint a Minister of the Interior who actually called the shots.  Over the years, sometimes that role was played by a cleric, but often it was a layman.  (As a footnote, it’s often said, erroneously, that popes lost their temporal powers in 1870 with the collapse of the Papal States amid Italian unification. Not so – what popes lost was territory, not power. With regard to the Vatican City State, the pope retains absolute civil authority to this day. Just to make sure no one misses the point, the new fundamental law specifies that the pope possesses “the fullness of the power of governance” as the “sovereign,” including “legislative, executive and judicial power.”)  That background brings us to the tale of the last layperson to exercise civil authority in the name of the pope: Pellegrino Rossi, who fate perhaps should serve as a cautionary tale for whoever his successors may be under Francis’s new scheme.  Born in Tuscany in 1787, Rossi studied law in Pisa and Bologna and became a celebrated professor and political thinker. After periods in Switzerland and France, he ended up as the personal envoy of King Louis Philippe I to the Papal States. After the king abdicated in February 1848, Rossi remained in Rome, and eventually was named the interior minister of the new pontiff Pope Pius IX in September of the same year.  By the time of Rossi’s appointment, revolutionary energies were stirring in Rome. Rossi was a federalist, meaning he believed in a federation of independent states on the Italian peninsula, including the full sovereignty of the Papal States, as opposed to the press for national unification then beginning to gather steam.  Although Rossi began efforts to modernize the pope’s civil administration, including plans for new railway miles and telegraph lines, it wasn’t enough for the revolutionaries, who were still seething over Pius IX’s famous allocution Non Semel, in which he made clear he would not join to military push to drive Austria out of northern Italy on the grounds that a pope could not go to war against a Catholic power.  Thus when Rossi arrived at Rome’s Piazza della Cancelleria at around 1:00 p.m. on November 15, 1848, for the opening of a session of the Chamber of Deputies in the Papal States, an assassin was waiting. As Rossi ascended the steps, a man emerged from the crowd and plunged a dagger into his throat. Eyewitness testimony was confused, as some said the assailant was wearing the uniform of a soldier, others that he was dressed as a parliamentarian. In any event, in chaos that followed, the killer was able to disappear.  Rossi staggered for a few steps, then fell to the ground dead.  His assassination set in motion a series of events which led to Pope Pius IX fleeing Rome to take refuge in Gaeta, a seaside town about 100 miles south, which at the time was part of the Bourbon Kingdom of Two Sicilies and a staunch ally of the papacy. Meanwhile in Rome a new revolutionary republic under Giuseppe Mazzini was declared, which would endure until the short-lived restoration of the pope’s secular authority in 1850.  By all accounts, Rossi was a gentle, urbane man of culture. Camillo Benso, the Count of Cavour, described Rossi in one of his letters as “the wittiest man in Italy, the most flexible genius of the age, perhaps the most practical mind in the universe.”  The great likelihood is that Rossi’s assassin had no real beef with him, but killed him as a blow against the pope he served.  Of course, it’s deeply improbable that restless denizens of the 108 acre territory the pope has left today would ever rise against one of his ministers in quite so violent a fashion. Knives in the back in the Vatican these days tend to be metaphorical, not literal.  Nevertheless, there’s still a sobering moral to this story: Anyone who wields authority in the name of the pope needs to know that sometimes, people upset with the pontiff may turn on you as a softer target.  In that light, perhaps the first lay person to sit on the new-fangled governing commission of the Vatican City State ought to make a trek to Rome’s Basilica of San Lorenzo in Damaso, where Rossi is entombed, and spend a moment in quiet prayer.  Uneasy, indeed, lies the head that wears even a share of the crown … whether that head, as it turns out, be clerical or lay."

This violent response by the public is a result of the escalating wave of violence perpetrated by armed gangs in the country.  According to local residents cited by Le Nouvelliste, on Friday, two suspected bandits were killed by members of the population while attempting to hijack a cargo truck on the road to Nazón. The suspects were armed, and the residents took matters into their own hands to protect themselves.  On Saturday, police authorities arrested four suspected bandits in possession of ammunition and automatic weapons in Gonaives. However, the situation took a gruesome turn when members of the population forcibly took custody of the suspects, subjecting them to stoning before setting them on fire. This represents the first time such an action has occurred in Gonaives since the emergence of the “Bwa kale” movement.  In a separate incident, on Monday, alleged bandit Abouló, a member of the “Nou se revolisyonè” group operating in the Raboto district, was arrested in Biennac. He was apprehended alongside two others, Ady Gaston and Poristène Byron. The police confiscated firearms and cell phones from them. Abouló faces charges of multiple murders and the burning of the city’s courthouse.  The Bwa kale movement has gained momentum in the capital and various provinces of Haiti. Comprised of members of the population, this movement takes matters into its own hands through acts of lynching against suspected bandits. The rise of such vigilantism reflects the frustration and desperation of the people in the face of rampant gang violence in the country."

During the flare-up in fighting that followed the death of imprisoned Palestinian activist Khader Adnan, Israeli airstrikes killed at least 18 Palestinians, while rockets from the Gaza Strip killed two civilians in Israeli-occupied territory.  Negotiations on a truce agreement, said two sources close to mediation efforts conducted by Cairo, were rendered complex due to Israel conducting multiple targeted assassinations, killing several senior members of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad Organization, despite officials in Tel Aviv having previously made pledges to stop the use of targeted assassinations.  At least six members of the Gaza-based organization were killed by the Israeli army in under a week, many of them members of the Islamic Jihad’s senior military council. A seventh official and his aide were also reportedly killed, though the group has yet to officially confirm the additional deaths.  Ten Palestinian civilians were also killed by Israeli airstrikes that were conducted in densely populated areas of the Gaza Strip, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.  Two civilians were killed in Israel by returning fire from the strip, where Al-Quds Brigades, the military arm of Islamic Jihad, said that “the Palestinian resistance launched a concentrated missile strike in two phases towards occupied Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.”    Israel’s prime minister and its national security advisor both thanked Cairo for its efforts to mediate the truce agreement, which came into effect on Saturday night.  But the conflict could be sparked again, said the first source. Israel’s current government — its most right-wing government so far — is subject to the hardline positions of its national security and finance ministers, Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, for whom Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu must work hard to keep close. The right-wing Israeli government wanted to start and end the war without any long-term commitments, said the two sources speaking to Mada Masr on condition of anonymity, and there are limits to the pressure that Cairo is able to exert on the Palestinian factions.  Cairo has been working since May 10 toward reaching a ceasefire between the Israeli occupation forces and factions in the Gaza Strip. The talks, they said, were held with Israeli and Palestinian Islamic Jihad representatives in the Egyptian capital, in Gaza with representatives of Hamas and other political groups based in the besieged strip, and finally, in Israel, with political and security officials.  To establish consensus on a ceasefire, they said, Israel needed to clearly pledge in written form to stop pursuing assassinations and hand over the bodies of any assassinated Palestinian figures. Palestinian factions, meanwhile, were obliged to publicly accept a truce — not just a ceasefire — and to accept Egyptian supervision to neutralize rocket launch capabilities from Gaza.  Egypt had to use “clear” language with Israel about the risks of “playing with fire,” said the first source, who was very close to the mediation efforts, given that Israel moved to expand its targeted assassinations. Egypt also requested that the United States and Europe pressure Israel to respond to mediation efforts, the two sources said.  Cairo “intensively moved at high levels” to avoid an escalation, said the first source, especially given the potential for the exchange of fire to take on regional dimensions.  Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian expressed support for the Palestinian resistance on Friday, announcing that he had made contact with Ismail Haniyeh, head of Hamas’ political bureau in Gaza. Hamas, the main faction operating armed resistance from the Gaza Strip, did not join the exchange of fire that broke out in May.  Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah also said on Friday that Hezbollah is communicating with groups in Gaza, saying, “We are monitoring the situation and its developments and providing assistance, and at any time we feel responsible to take any steps, we will not hesitate to do so.”  Groups in Gaza launched attacks on Israel following the May 2 death of Khader Adnan, a Palestinian activist jailed in Israel who starved to death following 87 days of hunger strike.  Riyad Mansour, Palestine’s permanent representative to the United Nations, called on Tuesday for serious and rapid measures to be taken to protect the Palestinian people and ensure their security, and to end the illegal Israeli colonial occupation and the apartheid regime that have been causing so much human suffering for decades and prevented the achievement of just and lasting peace and security in the region."

Haiti is the only country in the Caribbean or the world that the United Nations and other NGO organizations rank as the place with the most crime and gangs. Last week, the Haitian population along with the police killed and burned more than 20 residents who they said were gang members. Not counting other residents across the country who are killed on the pretext that they are gang members.  After the assassination of the former Haitian President in 2021, the U.S. and Canada were among the countries that ordered sanctions against the Haitian elites who sponsored the gangs despite proof that most of the powerful weapons are from the United States. A year later, the Dominican Republic ordered sanctions on former Prime Minister Claude Joseph for having a deep connection with the gangs. Canada’s Prime Minister even called on Europe and other continents to join his sanctions on powerful Haitian elites.  During the Presidency of former President Moise, crimes and kidnappings were very high. President Moise was criticized for not saying anything at all about high crimes and kidnappings during his administration. Since his assassination by Colombians and Haitian-Americans, crimes and kidnapping continued.  Since the killings of some individuals weeks ago, other residents across the country are not free or safe. There are currently allegations or conspiracy of killing unknown residents who come from another area. If the population catches an unknown resident from another area, there is a 98% chance that the population will kill and burn that resident.  According to several sources, there are many residents who are declared innocent by others who died this way. For now, no one in this country is safe because the population is mixed with armed people going around killing anyone they don’t recognize in an area even when they have no proof.  On Sunday, the Haitian politician Nortreus posted a safety alert publication on his Facebook account on the current crimes and assassinations across the country. He said he will not advise any citizens or investors from African countries to visit Haiti right now because there are many acts of violence and assassinations everywhere in the country.  “My concern on the current situation in Haiti. As a young Haitian politician who has friends and associates across the African continent, I will not advise citizens from African countries or investors to visit Haiti or invest right now because of violence and assassinations. Right now, this country is currently not safe to visit or invest in. Wait until the violence and assassinations go away to visit or invest”, Nortreus said on what is currently happening in Haiti in order to save lives.  According to several other reports, among the dead individuals from past weeks to today, there are several innocent residents who died along with the ones that the population and police classified as gang members due to fraudulent identity. Right now, no one is safe and any foreigners can get killed and burned."

Israel, like other states, is bound to international law. Some of its obligations are due to treaties, but there is also customary IHL -- generally accepted practices by states, who treat the practice as if it were law. Israel has adopted the Geneva Conventions, save for the Additional Protocols, but the High Court of Justice sees them as customary law. This shows how important the repeated practices of other states are in IHL.  Targeted killings are a somewhat ill-defined term. There is no set definition under International Humanitarian Law (IHL). Some sources treat it as merely a softer term than assassination, still others describe it as a military strike against a specific person -- in particular that of terrorists.  The International Committee of the Red Cross says that targeted killing is ""The intentional and premeditated use of lethal force, by a State or organized armed group against a specific individual outside their physical custody.""  This, like other definitions, can be applied to most other applications of military force. It is not exclusive to a particular legal or illegal action.  In Israel, it generally refers to a policy of targeting of the top echelons of terrorist organizations. Yet this can also be seen as a natural military action in the course of war, rather than a distinct category under IHL.  Palestinian rescue workers inspect a house where Islamic Jihad commander Ahmed Abu Daqqa was killed in an Israeli strike, in the southern Gaza Strip May 11, 2023 (credit: REUTERS/IBRAHEEM ABU MUSTAFA)  How does international humanitarian law consider targeted killings?  There do exist tools within the IHL framework to determine the legality of a military strike.  There is little that differentiates the opening blow of Shield and Arrow from strikes conducted later in the operation, save for the ongoing launching of rockets from Gaza. This creates a question of military necessity, one of the main principles of IHL.  The IDF argues that there was an impending threat from the Islamic Jihad commanders, and this created military necessity to strike. Killing the commanders reduced the capabilities of the organization to conduct terrorist attacks.  Yet it could also be argued that it has become customary in IHL for terrorist leaders to demand killing over a more general threat posed to a state. It is disputed whether Osama Bin Laden presented an immediate threat to the United States of America when then-president Barack Obama ordered his killing. The US contended he was still operationally active, but cited no active field operation. There was little to no backlash over this action. The killing of Gazan PIJ leaders could likewise be seen as having degraded terrorist effort in part of a sequential attack, or war, against Israel and its citizens.  In the discussion of targeted killings, sometimes the question is one of distinction. Under this principle of IHL, one differentiate between civilians and combatants in attacks, and take necessary precautions to avoid civilian casualties.  The status of Gazan terrorists is a matter of debate. Some argue that terrorists are unlawful combatants, but retain the status of civilians. This means they are only considered combatants when they are directly involved in direct hostilities. In state armed forces, High ranking officers who do not fight and only command and plan far from the battlefield are generally considered legitimate targets. This likely means that the action of ordering and planning could be considered a direct hostile action.  Yet non-state armed groups are also bound by IHL in both international and non-international conflicts. These commanders were part of an organized military force that had a hierarchy, insignias and uniform. Many treat Gaza as a de facto state, and the terrorist organizations as de facto state military forces. Western states targeted leaders of the Islamic State with increasing regularity, treating them as if they were members of an opposing armed force of recognized combatants.  Unlike in the West Bank, it is difficult to argue that Gazans are under occupation, which would mean that they lack that unlawful combatants have the same protections in that state of conflict.  Some are quick to point out that even if there is no debate about whether Islamic Jihad commanders are legitimate targets under IHL as combatants, the Israeli strikes also took the lives of the terrorists' civilian family members.  This is a matter of applying the principle of proportionality. The military advantage of a strike must exceed the potential risk of damage to civilians. This is determined by a reasonable commander using the best information at the time.  It is difficult to determine without full access to the extent of the impending threat, and understanding how the commanders fit into the PIJ hierarchy, to determine if the value of the military degradation was greater than the risk to civilians.  These IHL principles of proportionality, distinction and military necessity should be applied to all such targeted killings -- as they are to all IDF military strikes.  Therein lies the problem with the debate about targeted killings: Despite discussion of premeditation and accuracy, the term is more of a nebulous pejorative used to cast aspersion on a military action rather than carefully explore and weigh the facts of the individual incident.  It has become a label for if one approves of a military strike against a terrorist or not. It is a label that applies to some states, like Israel, and rarely questioned when used by others."

However, ZANU PF spokesperson Chris Mutsvangwa said that Mnangagwa was not part of the heads of State and government who had a photo opportunity with King Charles III because Zimbabwe is not a Commonwealth member.  Speaking on the sidelines of the burial of national hero Abraham Kabasa in Harare on Monday, Mutsvangwa said:  We are not a member of the Commonwealth, the President is determined that we should be readmitted into the group of nations.  Mutsvangwa added that Zimbabwe does not have the right to get close and personal with the king as it is not a Commonwealth member. He said:  But as for Zimbabwe, we did not have the right because we are not yet a member of the grouping. When we become a member, we would be part of those who will be close to the king. We want to engage with countries that we have cordial relationships and re-engage those we have had frosty relationships with in the past. Our President always says we are friends to all and enemies to none. We were happy that our President was invited to King Charles III’s coronation. When he was still a prince, he lowered the Union Jack (British flag) and raised the Zimbabwean flag after we had won the liberation struggle in 1980. It’s a person who we like a lot and it was imperative for the President to attend. This shows that the engagement between Harare and London is going in a good direction.  More: Pindula News"

The two brothers identified as Aaron Onuoha, 41 and Obinechi Samuel Onuoha, 35, were gruesomely assassinated in their family house at Ohanku by Udoka Street/Amucha, off Ngwa Road on Wednesday morning.  SaharaReporters gathered that the assailants who were reportedly numbering over 50 and wore black attire, invaded the house at about 1:20 am. They were said to have surrounded the house and cut off the electricity supply before some of them stormed the compound and killed the brothers.  According to sources, the assailants also burnt the house.  Samuel was a fashion designer based in Aba, while Aaron was a builder and a sculptor, who was based in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State.  Aaron had visited his brother on Tuesday evening to discuss family matters.  The hoodlums also allegedly attacked the Chief Security Officer of the area and burnt the security post.  A source told SaharaReporters that the CSO narrowly escaped being killed by the assailants.  A close associate of the late Samuel who spoke to SaharaReporters on condition of anonymity, revealed that he was attacked last year by hoodlums suspected to be cultists but survived the attack.  ""In that particular attack, it was in the daytime and he saw the faces of those who tried to kill him,” the source said.  He continued, ""I find it unbelievable because that night when I got information about the incident, I rushed to the scene. And while I was going, I met several local security personnel at their checkpoints.  “So where were they when the brothers were being killed and their house set ablaze?""  According to him, he later heard a report that the assailants accused Samuel of giving out information to police about them and their hideouts.  He said, “I know that he had police friends who were working with the police Rapid Response Squad (RRS) in Aba.  ""Before his gruesome killing, I had on one occasion asked whether he gave information about bad boys to the police and he said no. According to him, when he was attacked the last time by some cult group, he went to RRS office to see some of his friends, especially his in-law and one of the cult guys that shot at him. He told the in-law that this one was among those that attacked him and that is all.""  The source, however, regretted that no security agent either from the police division around the area or the RSS unit intervened during the attack until the morning when the criminals had gone.  Also speaking to SaharaReporters, a sibling of the deceased brothers, Agbeze Onuoha confirmed the tragic incident and called on security agencies to fish out the perpetrators to ensure that they face justice.  Lamenting the incident, he said his late brothers left behind 10 children – five each. He asked how he would cope with caring for the wives and children left behind.  Narrating the unfortunate incident, Agbeze, an employee of Enugu Electricity Distribution Company in Abakaliki, the Ebonyi State capital, said, ""I came back to see my mother on Saturday and I was supposed to go back to my working station on Wednesday. Unfortunately, that early Wednesday morning, my phone rang; it was my nephew. He called to tell me that two of my brothers had been killed.  ""The elder one Aaron is living at Uyo in Akwa Ibom State but came back to see his brother in Aba on Tuesday and they were killed together. That is what I can say, I don't know what transpired. I just came to see our mother in Aba because my family is in Okigwe, Imo State while I am working in Abakaliki.  ""So when I got the report, I went there and saw what happened and reported to the police. They came and carried their corpses to the mortuary.""  He added that Samuel's wife who was present when the assailants killed the brother, said the killers drove her and her five children out of the house before burning it.  He said according to her, the assailants were more than 50 in number and were in black attire.  He added, ""From the information I gathered, their killers said Samuel was giving information to police where they are. Even the children said when they went to fetch water, some people were telling them that their father used to give information to the police about them.""  ""My family is demanding justice; the police should fish out their killers and make them pay for their crimes,"" he said.  Agbeze, however, noted that he had informed Aaron’s wife about the tragic incident, adding that he was “planning to bury them next week"".  When SaharaReporters contacted the spokesperson for the state police command, SP Geoffrey Ogbonna, for an update, he declined to comment."
