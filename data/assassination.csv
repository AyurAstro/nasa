In the past few days, several tweets from accounts impersonating the sons of former Prime Minister Imran Khan appeared on social media. The accounts posted pictures of Imran Khan’s sons with him in several posts along with emotional messages, expressing solidarity with the PTI chairman.  These accounts amassed a huge following within a passage of a few days. Jemima took to Twitter to warn people from following fake accounts. Her response came when a Twitter user asked her about the authenticity of the Twitter accounts.  Jemima criticized Twitter CEO Elon Musk for fake accounts of her children. In her tweet, she said, “Thanks @elonmusk Fake accounts pretending to be my children, created by imposters with a political agenda in Pakistan. This is exactly what I feared would happen when you took away Twitter’s verification blue ticks. FYI my children are not on social media & have no plans to be,” said Jemima in her tweet.

They argued that such policies would facilitate people creating fake accounts.  The sons of Imran Khan had visited him following his injury in the assassination attempt a few months ago. They stayed for a few days with him and then returned to England. The sons have been living with their mother Jemima in the UK following the separation between the couple.  Imran Khan married Reham Khan for the second time. The marriage did not last long and they parted ways within two years. Khan then married his spiritual guide Bushra Begum before becoming the prime minister in 2018.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbHZpbGxhZ2VzcGFjZS5jb20vamVtaW1hLXdhcm5zLW9mLWZha2UtcHJvZmlsZXMtaW1wZXJzb25hdGluZy1oZXItc29ucy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Mr Putin had a huge underground bunker built beneath Gelendzhik Palace, according to plans posted online by the engineering firm in charge of the project, with a network of tunnels lying around 50 metres under the surface.  The complex, first reported by Business Insider, is thought to have been constructed for protection in the event of a revolution or war and was built before Russia took over Crimea in 2014.  The £1bn palace is located on a verge overlooking the sea and takes up a 190,000 square-foot area. It even has its own church, ice rink, casino and hookah lounge.  (Alexei Navalny)  The labyrinth of hidden tunnels was revealed by jailed Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation, after the defunct Russian construction firm Metro Style posted the diagrams on its website in the early 2010s to show off their work.  The bunkers appear to have a ventilation system, sewerage and a fresh water supply, while the walls are 15-inch concrete shells, as shown in the diagrams.  There is also an elevator shaft that connects the complex to the two tunnels, as revealed in one diagram - and the lower one has a walkway to the beach, as well as cable racks that could be used to bring electricity, lighting and fibre-optic cables to a command post.  Meanwhile, exits from both tunnels can be seen on the cliff face rising up from the sea to the palace.  Exits from both tunnels can be seen on the cliff face (Alexei Navalny/YouTube)  “This tunnel set-up has all kinds of safety and security,” said Thaddeus Gabryszewski, who is a structural engineer familiar with defensive structures and reviewed the diagrams for Business Insider. “There’s a fire system. There’s water, there’s a sewer. This is intended for someone to survive or escape.”  The engineering company described the project as an “underground complex for a resort” in Gelendzhik, the town closest to the Russian president’s palace, and it stretches across 6,500 square feet.  Speaking to Business Insider, Michael C Kimmage, who is a former State Department official and worked on Russia and Ukraine policy, said: ""Putin has a lot of anxiety about being the not-entirely-legitimate leader of Russia.  “So knowing that his legitimacy is not entirely secured by-elections, he is going to seek to maximise his personal safety through a complex of well-defended personal residences.""  There is also an elevator shaft that connects the complex to the two tunnels, as revealed in one diagram - and the lower one has a walkway to the beach (Wayback Machine / Metro Style)  The diagrams were taken down from Metro Style’s website in 2016, but they were still visible on the Wayback Machine, which is an archive of online content.  Then they were circulated in a community of so-called ”diggers”, which are a group of Russian citizens who visit and document forbidden sites.  An anonymous digger who said he was part of a group called “Sect Z” told Business Insider that he was sharing the images “because we are tired of Putin’s stupid face and want to show his paranoid underground transport”.  The bunkers have a ventilation system, sewerage and a fresh water supply, while the walls are 15-inch concrete shells, as shown in the diagrams (Wayback Machine / Metro Style)  The diagrams were taken down from Metro Style’s website in 2016, but they were still visible on the Wayback Machine, which is an archive of online content (Wayback Machine / Metro Style)  Last month, a protection officer for Mr Putin defected and called the Russian president a “paranoid war criminal”.  Gleb Karakulov, 35, who served as an engineer in the Federal Guard Service (FSO) presidential communications unit, claimed last month that Mr Putin opts to stay “in his bunker” rather than make trips because he is so paranoid about an assassination attempt.  The Russian president also allegedly travels with a 2.5 metre high box to prevent his secret talks from leaking and Western bugging.  Mr Karakulov claimed that the Russian president is isolating for a fourth year in a row, out of fear of becoming infected with Covid-19, and staff can only work in the same room as him once they have been in isolation for two weeks.  Mr Putin does not use a mobile phone or the internet, meaning his knowledge of events is filtered via the secret services - and what he watches on state-controlled Russian TV, according to Mr Karakulov.  The diagrams were circulated in a community of so-called ‘diggers’ , which are a group of Russian citizens who visit and document forbidden sites (Wayback Machine / Metro Style)  Speaking about the war in Ukraine, Mr Karakulov issued an appeal to officers to come forward with evidence about Mr Putin as a “war criminal,” saying the war is “beyond the pale” and “defies reason”.  When the organisation of opposition leader Mr Navalny initially published an expose of the Russian president’s Black Sea palace in 2021, thousands of Russians protested, holding up gold-painted toilet brushes in reference to a £700 utensil allegedly found in the residence.  Opposition leader Alexei Navalny published an expose of the Russian president’s Black Sea palace in 2021 (Copyright 2021 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.)  Mr Putin has denied owning the palace. Meanwhile, his billionaire childhood friend claimed that the property belonged to him not the president, who he said had nothing to do with it.  But the palace, which is surrounded by 17,000 acres of woods, is constantly protected by Mr Putin’s security team and protected by a no-fly zone – and the Kremlin failed to explain why this was the case if the president does not live there.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvLnVrL25ld3Mvd29ybGQvZXVyb3BlL3B1dGluLWJ1bmtlci1zZWNyZXQtdHVubmVscy1ydXNzaWEtYjIzNDE5NTcuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"assassination","2023-05-29","Not Discerned","{""Okitipupa"", ""Ondo"", ""Nigeria""}","2023-05-20T06:15:58","• Pirisola seeks action on refineries, graft, unemployment As the nation prepares to usher in a new administration at different levels of government on May 29, the political leaders have been tasked to manage carefully and fairly the diversity of the country such that no section will feel neglected in the interest of peace, survival of democracy and national development. Essentially, appointments into offices should be done in a way that gives every part of the county a sense of belonging, which is an antidote to agitations. The Anglican Diocese On The Coast, Ondo State gave the advice at the First Session of its 10th Synod held at the Cathedral Church of Ebenezer, Ilutitun in Okitipupa Local Government Area last weekend. The Diocesan, the Rt. Rev’d Oluseyi Pirisola, in his charge, thanked God for keeping the nation united and peaceful in the face of happenings that could have torn its fabrics into pieces. He urged relevant authorities to address the rapidly falling value of the naira that has made the prices of goods and services to go beyond the reach of most Nigerians. The Synod lamented the resurgence of cruel killing of innocent citizens after the general elections, urging security agencies to work harder to tackle the menace. The Anglicans called for revival of the nation’s refineries for optimal production, revival of agriculture and agro-allied companies as well as provision enabling environment for businesses to thrive so as to create employment opportunities for the people. They commended President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration for removal of railway and electricity generation, distribution and transmission from the Exclusive Legislative list thus allowing the state government to build and operate these amenities. The state governments were advised to quickly take advantage of the change of this policy to develop their own areas. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) was admonished to study the complaints against the conduct of the 2023 general elections with a view to improving upon it in future elections for transparency and peace in the nation’s democratic process, just as the Federal Government was tasked to do everything within its power to avert constant strike in the universities. The Synod themed ‘The God who Hears, Cares and Intervenes’ was attended by eminent citizens, including Obagberume of Igbodigo, Oba Ebunoluwa Aiyeku; Halu of Ode Aye Kindgom, Oba Williams Akinlade; Majuwa of Morubodo Kingdom, Oba Ernest Idepefo; Gen. Olu Bajowa (rtd) represented by Chief Olu Akinbo; Prof Monone Omosule and Dr. (Mrs) Omosule of Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile Ife; Senator Boluwaji Kunlere (Chancellor) and Price Fioye Bajowa, former secretary to Ondo State government. Others are Bishop of the Diocese of Ile Oluji, the Rt. Rev’d Abel Ajibodu; Bishop of Idoani Diocese, Rt. Rev’d Oludare Agara; Vice Chairman, Okitipupa Local Government, Chief Ola Iwaeni; Mr Duro Olatunji, former Chairman of Briscoe Motors and former Chancellor, Barrister Timothy Akinyeye. To alleviate the negative impacts of unemployment in the socio-economic life of the citizens, especially the youth, the government was advised to give priority attention to the problem, just as it urged job seekers to acquire 21st-century skills that can easily fetch them gainful employment. Diocese On The Coast lamented high level of corruption and suggested that the menace be tackled through reformation of public administration and public finance management and strengthening the role of auditing agencies; creation of pathways that would give citizens relevant tools and social empowerment skills and opportunities to engage and participate in governance; provision of incentives for the general population to boldly report cases of corruption; intentional and adequate funding and strengthening of the bodies that prosecute corruption cases, EFCC and ICPC; and promotion of transparency and access to information. The church urged the Federal Government to end the epileptic power supply in the country which has forced many companies to relocate to neighbouring countries. Ondo State government was commended for laudable projects executed across the state, noting the establishment of the Amotekun Corps for safety of life and property and the Okitipupa-Igodan Bye Pass for improved transportation system within Ondo South axis. The delegates also praised the government for payment of salaries and pensions up to date, urging that the same attention be given to gratuities. The church, however, decried payment of salary in instalments by the government. As the state prepares to elect a new governor in 2024, the Synod appealed that the campaigns should be issue-based, devoid of calumny and character assassination and the election proper should be violent-free. The delegates decried continued darkness in Ondo South comprising Okitipupa, Irele, Ilaje and Ese-Odo Local Government areas due to disconnection from the national grid since 2014 and called for the intervention of the state government and other stakeholders to save the economy and socio-economic life of the affected places. The state government was advised to put pressure on the Federal Government to fix failed roads, including the Orita-Ilado to Gbagada Bridge, to reduce the economic wastage that farmers suffer on account of the bad condition of the roads.

The spokesperson dismissed any official or unofficial connection between Iran and the arrestees, stressing that the popular relationships between the citizens of the two countries are “heartfelt, emotional, historical, religious and even family-based.”  “The government of Azerbaijan should not attribute such deep-rooted and historical bonds of its nationals to security issues or associate them with neighbors.”  Kanaani noted that every government has the inherent right to take action against the law-breaking citizens, but made it clear that Baku’s move to arrest and imprison many citizens by making the allegation of connection with Iran is inadmissible and unacceptable.  Azerbaijan’s interior ministry, security service and the office of prosecutor general said in a joint statement on Tuesday that at least nine Azeri nationals have been arrested, suspected of being “linked to Iranian secret services and of plotting a coup and assassinations”.  The statement gave nine names and said several other people had been arrested.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jaWFsdHJpYnVuZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvbmF0aW9uYWwvMTE4MTUzL2F6ZXJiYWlqYW4tcy1zZXJpZXMtb2YtYWxsZWdhdGlvbnMtZGlzbWlzc2Vk0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN SUFFERED SERIOUS COMPLICATIONS FROM HER BOUT WITH SHINGLES THAT LEFT HER UNABLE TO RETURN TO THE SENATE FOR NEARLY THREE MONTHS. HER SPOKESPERSON TOLD OUR PARTNERS AT THE SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE SHE SUFFERED FROM RAMSAY HUNT SYNDROME AND ENCEPHALITIS. ENCEPHALITIS IS THE INFLAMMATION OF THE BRAIN THAT CAUSES IT TO SWELL. FEINSTEIN SPOKESPERSON SAYS THOSE SYMPTOMS RESOLVE THEMSELVES AFTER SHE WAS RELEASED FROM THE HOSPITAL BACK IN MARCH. RAMSAY HUNT IS CHARACTERIZED BY FACIAL PARALYSIS AND HEARING LOSS IN ONE EAR. CAN ALSO CAUSE DAMAGE AND PAIN. THE SENATOR CONTINUES TO HAVE COMPLICATIONS FROM THIS SYNDROME, AND FEINSTEIN RETURNED TO CAPITOL HILL LAST WEEK WHERE SHE WILL HAVE A LIGHTER SCHEDULE. WE’RE TOLD SEVERAL CONGRESSIONAL MEMBERS HA  Advertisement Sen. Dianne Feinstein's office details previously unknown complications from shingles illness Share Copy Link Copy  Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein's office said Thursday that she is suffering from Ramsay Hunt syndrome, a complication from the shingles virus that can paralyze part of the face, and that she contracted encephalitis while recovering from the virus earlier this year.Feinstein, 89, had not previously disclosed those medical details, though she said in a statement last week that she had suffered complications from the virus. The longtime California senator returned from a more than two-month absence on May 10 after weeks of questions about her declining health and whether she would be back in the Senate at all.Adam Russell, a spokesman for Feinstein, said that the encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain, ""resolved itself shortly after she was released from the hospital in March."" Feinstein continues to have complications from the Ramsay Hunt syndrome, Russell said.Russell confirmed the two complications after the New York Times first reported them, raising questions about whether she had been hiding the extent of her illnesses. Upon her return last week, Feinstein was using a wheelchair and noticeably thinner, and has appeared confused at times when speaking to reporters or being wheeled through the halls.""The senator previously disclosed that she had several complications related to her shingles diagnosis,"" Russell said in the statement. ""As discussed in the New York Times article, those complications included Ramsay Hunt syndrome and encephalitis.""Feinstein's face has appeared partially paralyzed since she returned to the Senate, stirring some speculation about whether she had had a stroke. Ramsay Hunt syndrome is a complication that occurs when the shingles virus reaches a facial nerve near the ears. It can also cause hearing loss.Encephalitis can also be caused by shingles. The swelling of the brain can have a number of different symptoms, including personality changes, seizures, stiffness, confusion and problems with sight or hearing, according to the Mayo Clinic.Aides to Feinstein said last week that she is still recovering from her illness and would operate on a reduced schedule. Since she has returned, she has missed some votes where she was not needed. On Wednesday, for example, she missed the first three Senate votes of the day but appeared for the last two, in which the margin was much closer.Feinstein has faced questions for several years about her clearly declining health and her mental acuity. In February Feinstein said she would not run for re-election in 2024.But some Democrats have pushed for her to leave sooner. A member of the California congressional delegation, Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, called on her to resign as she stayed away from Washington for more than ten weeks, and several other House progressives have echoed his call. And Senate Democrats were increasingly anxious during Feinstein's absence as they were unable to confirm some of President Joe Biden's judicial nominees with a narrow 51-49 majority. Video above: Sen. Feinstein returns to the Senate after absenceAs Democrats worried, Feinstein made an unusual request to be temporarily replaced on the Judiciary panel while she remained out of the Senate. But Republicans last month blocked a vote, saying there was little precedent for a temporary committee replacement and that they didn't want to help Democrats confirm the most partisan judges. Others said they thought Democrats were unfairly trying to push her out of office.Two weeks later, Democrats said that Feinstein would return to Washington.A senator for more than three decades, Feinstein has had a groundbreaking political career and shattered gender barriers. She was the first woman to serve as president of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in the 1970s and the first female mayor of San Francisco. She ascended to that post after the November 1978 assassinations of then-Mayor George Moscone and City Supervisor Harvey Milk by a former supervisor, Dan White. Feinstein found Milk's body.In the Senate, she was the first woman to head the Senate Intelligence Committee and the first woman to serve as the Judiciary Committee's top Democrat.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnd2dG0xMy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9kaWFubmUtZmVpbnN0ZWluLXJhbXNheS1odW50LXN5bmRyb21lLXNoaW5nbGVzLWNvbXBsaWNhdGlvbnMvNDM5NDE3NTnSAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy53dnRtMTMuY29tL2FtcC9hcnRpY2xlL2RpYW5uZS1mZWluc3RlaW4tcmFtc2F5LWh1bnQtc3luZHJvbWUtc2hpbmdsZXMtY29tcGxpY2F0aW9ucy80Mzk0MTc1OQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The report provides an update on significant events in Afghanistan covering the period from January 1st to March 31st 2023.  Major Topics of Report  Intelligence Shortfalls. The commander of Unites States Central Command says that the Department of Defense lacks the ability to see the full picture of terrorist threats that could come from Afghanistan. He indicated that there is a need for new airborne intelligence platforms capable of remaining aloft in the region for extended periods of time. He also said that there is a need for increased intelligence collection – both signals and human intelligence.  ISKP. The Islamic State Khorsan Provice (ISKP) continues to mount attacks against Taliban officials and civilians in Afghanistan. The high-profile attacks include assassinations and bombings. ISKP could also strike U.S. or Western interests abroad within six months if they prioritized such attacks.  Diplomacy. U.S. diplomats continue to engage with the Taliban to promote U.S. interests. Issues under discussion include the safety of U.S. citizens in Afghanistan, relocation of U.S. Afghan allies, economy, terrorism, and human rights.  Assisting Afghan Allies (SIVs). The State Department is reported to have provided permanent consular staffing in Qatar, United Arab Emirates, and Pakistan to improve Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) and refugee processing. The Department of State issued 5,616 SIVs this quarter. Afghan resettlement agencies in the United States are facing challenges due to the rapid pace of arrivals (from Afghanistan and elsewhere), difficulty in obtaining documentation, and limited staffing.  Humanitarian Situtation. The number of Afghans needed assistance in Afghanistan has doubled since 2020; more than 2/3s of the population is in need of assistance. The U.S. is providing $541 million in aid to Afghanistan in FY2023 focused on food, health, shelter, livelihoods, and education.  *********  Operation Enduring Sentinel, Lead Inspector General Report to the United States Congress, January 1, 2023 – March 31, 2023, published May 18, 2023, PDF, 54 pages.  https://www.stateoig.gov/uploads/report/report_pdf_file/q2fy2023_leadig_oes_508.pdf  Photo: U.S. Marines assigned to the Special Purpose Marine Air Ground Task Force – Crisis Response – Central Command provide security at Hamid Karzai International Airport during the Kabul non-combatant evacuation operation (NEO) in Afghanistan on August 18, 2021.

Ziad al-Nakhla made the remarks in an event to commemorate the 33 Palestinians killed in the Israeli attacks, including civilians and the movement’s leaders. He said the regime was forced to accept Palestinians’ terms for a ceasefire in the face of hundreds of rockets fired into the occupied territories. Nakhala added that Palestinians dealt another blow to Israel’s already tarnished image. The Palestinian official attributed the victory to Palestinian unity and sacrifices. Nakhla also thanked the countries that have been supporting the Palestinian people, particularly Iran. He stressed that Palestinians are more determined than ever to defend their rights and liberate their land. Nakhala also vowed a strong and painful response to any future Israeli assassination of the group’s commanders.  Syria returns to Arab League  Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has expressed hope that the Arab League summit will pave the way for joint Arab action to achieve prosperity in the region rather than war and destruction. Assad described the bloc’s 32nd summit, hosted by Saudi Arabia, as a historic opportunity to address crises across the region without foreign interference. It was the first time Assad was addressing the organization since Syria’s membership was suspended in 2011 amid a foreign-backed militancy to topple the government in Damascus. Syria returned to the Arab League earlier this month. That followed normalization of ties between Syria and Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The country’s return to the Arab fold comes after Assad’s government regained control of most of areas seized by militants.

Earlier, US President Joe Biden told G-7 leaders that Washington supports supplying advanced warplanes, including F-16s, to Kiev. The US was previously opposed to the idea over its cost and the length of time it would take to complete. Washington has also ruled out sending warplanes out of its own stocks to Ukraine.

The Secretary-General of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) Movement, Ziad Al-Nakhalah  The Secretary-General of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) Movement, Ziad Al-Nakhalah, confirmed on Friday that ""Tel Aviv"" and other cities of the Zionist entity ""are within the range of our rockets and the bullets of our fighters.""  During a speech at the festival commemorating the martyrs of Operation Avenging the Free in the city of Saida, south Lebanon, Al-Nakhalah said, ""We meet today to honor a great group of martyrs and leaders who were killed in the treacherous aggression and to honor the two martyrs, Commander Khader Adnan and Commander Ali Al-Aswad, and everyone who ascended to martyrdom in Operation Avenging the Free.""  The PIJ memorizes the names, faces, and wills of the martyrs and will convey their names, titles, and dreams to future generations, he said.  Al-Nakhalah continued, ""Someday, we will inevitably write the names of the martyrs on the walls, mosque, and gates of Al-Quds,"" stressing that ""the enemy's illusions of strength and arrogance will be shattered when faced with the Palestinian people's will, ability, and determination to uphold confrontation and fight until victory is achieved.""  The PIJ Secretary-General underlined that the Palestinian people will not hesitate to offer sacrifices and that ""our martyrs are the ones who lead our path in achieving a balance of power with the enemy,"" stressing that the success of Operation Avenging the Free came ""with the blessing of the martyrs' spilled blood and the preservation of the unity of the Palestinian people.""  Al-Nakhalah said the movement stood strong and fought despite the martyrdom of commanders, fighters, and whole families, stressing that the PIJ has proven to the enemy that it is always ready ""to fight successive battles in defense of our people and to prevent our blood from being spilled.""  He warned the Israeli occupation that the PIJ's response to any assassination ""will be strong, clear and painful,"" stressing that ""Tel Aviv and other cities of the Zionist entity are within the range of our rockets and the bullets of our fighters.""  Operation Avenging the Free new chapter in life of Palestinian people  Al-Nakhalah pointed out that despite ""all the difficult circumstances and the imbalance of military power in favor of the enemy, our people are still fighting,"" adding, ""We have steadfastly and patiently fought major battles in defense of our identity and adherence to our rights, and our cause has remained alive.""  The PIJ chief considered that the occupation wanted to cast a shadow ""over our cause with politics and wars, but today we stand stronger and more determined to adhere to our rights and Al-Quds.""  He said Operation Avenging the Free ""is a new chapter in the life of our people, a chapter of unity, and a chapter for the integration of the Resistance with all its different factions.""  Al-Nakhalah pointed out that Operation Avenging the Free ""is a great day for the PIJ and for the people who stood united in defiance of the Zionist aggression.""  He said PIJ top commanders were martyred, leaving behind a legacy of fighters ready to engage in any battle necessary, adding, ""We are the people of jihad and resistance.""  The Palestinian leader explained that after the assassination of martyr Khader Adnan and Al-Quds Brigades commanders, ""the enemy thought that we would let their martyrdom go unanswered, but our fighters went out to rearrange the equations again,"" stressing that ""our battles prove that our nation can triumph over the Zionist project that conquered it and was the cause of its dependence and weakness.""  He pointed out that the Palestinian people were able to ""rub the enemy's nose in the dirt and shatter its arrogance more than once, and Operation Avenging the Free is the greatest proof of that.""  Al-Nakhalah said the Egyptian-mediated ceasefire entered into force ""based on the approval of the Palestinian and Israeli parties.""  ""Didn't anyone wonder who this Palestinian side is?"" he said.  He stressed that the Palestinian side is the ""PIJ - one faction that has nothing but its fighters and a people standing behind it and a Resistance that embraces it.""  He noted that one faction fought on the battlefield and negotiated to stop the aggression and obliged the enemy to stop its crimes, even if it does not commit to that later.  He continued mockingly, ""Where is the arrogance? Where is the invincible army? Where is the power of Israel and its rejection of international resolutions?""  Arab summit must assume its responsibility toward the Palestinian cause  Regarding the ceasefire, the Secretary-General of the Islamic Jihad Movement said the enemy was lying claiming that it ""withdrew from the negotiations, and this is not true. It is us who put off the negotiations more than once.""  He added that on the fifth day of the aggression, ""we presented the text of the agreement and preconditioned them either the enemy accepts it or we withdraw from the negotiations.”  “Our nation possesses capabilities that exceed by far the capabilities of the enemy, but all it lacks is the will to fight and the will to stand strong,” he further added.  Al-Nakhalah explained that the Zionist entity, despite ""possessing all the material elements of strength, it does not possess the [spirit of the] fighter we have.""  Reflecting a state of realism, the Resistance leader said, ""We do know that we have great challenges ahead and we are very well aware that one or more battles will not be able to achieve all our goals and aspirations, but ""our previous battles and today's Operation Avenging the Free have put us on the right track, and we have set out in that direction with no intention to stop.”  In this context, PIJ Secretary-General stressed that the Palestinian people are ""the vital element in the equation of struggle standing up to the balance of power,” adding that the nation today has a rare opportunity, which it must seize if it is serious about supporting the steadfastness of the Palestinian people.  Al-Nakhalah stressed that the Arab League Summit currently being held in Jeddah must ""assume its responsibility toward the Palestinian cause and the suffering of the Palestinian people,"" adding that ""the unity of our people and the Resistance forces is of paramount importance, and we must preserve and strengthen it.""  He also pointed out that ""the Palestinian Resistance can fight the enemy and defeat when it receives strong and permanent support,"" adding that ""the position of our brethren in Hezbollah, represented by Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah's speech, was highly appreciated by the Resistance and our people.""  In conclusion, Al-Nakhalah stressed that ""the permanent [presence] of the joint room and its willingness to enter the battle was an important factor in shortening the days of the aggression,” calling on the Resistance fighters wherever they may be to stay away from any tools and means that the enemy can use to locate them.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vZW5nbGlzaC5hbG1heWFkZWVuLm5ldC9uZXdzL3BvbGl0aWNzL3RlbC1hdml2LW90aGVyLWlzcmFlbGktY2l0aWVzLW5vdC1mYXItZnJvbS1yb2NrZXQtcmFuZ2U6LW5ha9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2023-10-10","Not Discerned","{""Moscow"", ""Moscow"", ""Russia""}","2023-05-19T11:00:00","Open this photo in gallery: Russian opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza sits on a bench inside a defendants' cage during a hearing at the Basmanny court in Moscow, on Oct. 10, 2022.NATALIA KOLESNIKOVA/AFP/Getty Images  Brandon Silver is an international human-rights lawyer and director of policy and projects at the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights. Irwin Cotler is a former minister of justice and attorney-general of Canada and special envoy of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Community of Democracies for Vladimir Kara-Murza. Bill Browder is the chief executive officer of Hermitage Capital and head of the Global Justice for Sergei Magnitsky Campaign.  Russia tried to kill Vladimir Kara-Murza twice. His would-be assassins now hold him in a Moscow prison.  After miraculously surviving two poisonings by the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Russian democratic opposition leader nonetheless courageously continues his anti-Putin advocacy and opposition to the brutal war in Ukraine. For this, he now languishes in a Russian prison, sentenced to 25 years in jail. This is the harshest prison sentence ever meted out to a political prisoner in Vladimir Putin’s Russia.  Mr. Kara-Murza is one of Russia’s most eloquent and erudite advocates, a regular presence in parliaments around the world, making the case for solidarity with Russian civil society and support for its people in the struggle against Mr. Putin’s authoritarianism. In the process, he made our countries safer and more humane, exposing the proceeds of corruption and criminality corroding our economy and democracy, and providing tools to redress it. He was instrumental in the adoption of Magnitsky legislation around the world, ensuring that these human-rights violators cannot enjoy the freedoms abroad that they deny their citizens at home.  Some of the first individuals to be sanctioned under these laws that Mr. Kara-Murza initiated are now the ones directly overseeing the prison in which he is arbitrarily detained, and his unjust persecution and prosecution that underpin it. If that wasn’t Kafkaesque enough, these are also the very same Russian officials responsible for the murder of Sergei Magnitsky in jail, and the subsequent assassination attempts on Mr. Kara-Murza for pursuing sanctions against them for this crime. He would not survive a third poisoning at their hands, the risk of which grows every day he remains in their custody.  The democratic world has been the beneficiary of Mr. Kara-Murza’s brilliance, and should match his courage in opposing Mr. Putin with an abiding commitment to securing his freedom.  Canada has led the charge, with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau personally announcing at the G20 summit the implementation of targeted Magnitsky-style sanctions on all those involved in the case. This follows high-level engagement from Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly, who has anchored clear public statements with concrete diplomatic action. In a politically fractious environment, support for Mr. Kara-Murza’s case is a rare point of consensus, with every Canadian political party leader and Parliament as a whole standing in solidarity.  It is poetic justice that one of the main authors of our Magnitsky laws should have them used to help secure his freedom, and other jurisdictions are following Canada’s lead. The United States recently cited Canada’s important stand when announcing its own sanctions against Mr. Kara-Murza’s oppressors, with Britain following shortly thereafter.  To rid the world of Putin, we must support Russian heroes like Vladimir Kara-Murza  Canada can continue to be a global trendsetter in pursuing the natural next step: honorary citizenship.  Mr. Kara-Murza’s case is an emblematic one. As a leading voice of the democratic opposition – a journalist, dissident, human-rights activist and political leader with an unimpeachable record of public service – he has spoken out on behalf of the over 24,000 people who have been arbitrarily arrested in Russia. As the most dedicated and visible spokesperson for Russian political prisoners until he became one himself, elevating Mr. Kara-Murza’s case will equally give voice to all those others unlawfully detained.  This spotlight would give lifesaving protective cover from the worst dangers and deprivations that grow in the darkness of Mr. Putin’s dungeons. It would also give hope to those in their most desperate moments, showing these courageous prisoners that they are not forgotten, and that Canadians stand with them in their struggle for democracy and against Mr. Putin’s crimes.  Such a move would also directly counter the Putin regime and advance Canada’s interests. By elevating such cases, we would be underscoring that Russians oppose Mr. Putin and his war of aggression, and thereby also undermine Mr. Putin’s aggressive propaganda campaign in that regard.  But it also tells a bigger story, of the dangers of authoritarianism and human-rights abuses, and the costs of inaction.  It was Mr. Kara-Murza who repeatedly warned us that internal repression is inextricably linked to external aggression. When Mr. Putin assaulted Chechnya; when he invaded Georgia; when he annexed Crimea; when he bombarded Syria; and when he was engaged in murdering and maiming dissidents and journalists, it was the inaction of the international community that not only indulged this culture of corruption and criminality but also incentivized a culture of impunity. This is what paved the path to the full-scale aggression against Ukraine.  For an enduring peace to prevail, not only must Ukraine receive the fullest extent of military, economic and diplomatic support to drive out Mr. Putin, but so must Russian civil society. A democratic post-Putin Russia would mitigate against the resurgence of tyranny that has been a source of terror in Russia and the region since the time of Czarist pogroms, through Soviet totalitarianism, to Mr. Putin’s current authoritarian mafia state.  Taking action on emblematic cases like Mr. Kara-Murza’s highlights and gives hope to all those other cases of freedom fighters courageously confronting the Russian regime. As Mr. Putin puts in prison all those who oppose the war – such as Aleksei Gorinov, who is serving a seven-year sentence for speaking truth to power and calling Mr. Putin’s invasion the criminal war that it is – and killing journalists and human-rights defenders who seek to expose this truth, democratic governments should provide them a lifeline. Honorary citizenship for Mr. Kara-Murza would do just that.  For those few others who have evaded imprisonment in Russia, Canada can provide a pathway to actual citizenship. The Czech Republic, for instance, has provided 600 emergency visas to Russian journalists at risk. Canada can do the same for all those independent media and human-rights defenders forced to flee to continue their essential work unmasking the corruption and criminal abuses of Mr. Putin and his cronies.  As Mr. Kara-Murza recently wrote from prison, “It’s not only about moral support (although the significance of that is difficult to overstate). Sustained high-level advocacy from democratic nations has helped secure the release of prisoners of conscience all over the world. … Few political accomplishments can compare in importance to returning freedom to those unjustly deprived of it.”  We owe this to Mr. Kara-Murza, and to all Russians putting not only their livelihoods but their very lives on the line in opposing Mr. Putin’s brutal dictatorship and destructive war. In recognizing Mr. Kara-Murza with honorary citizenship, advocating for the release of political prisoners, and offering emergency refuge for those at risk of becoming prisoners, we can honour their sacrifice, sustain their courage, and support our shared vision of a free and democratic Russia.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdsb2JlYW5kbWFpbC5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9hcnRpY2xlLWNhbmFkYS1jYW4taGVscC1ydXNzaWFuLWRpc3NpZGVudC12bGFkaW1pci1rYXJhLW11cnphLWJ5LWdpdmluZy1oaW0v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","1945-04-08","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T21:05:00","The Nazis were racist garbage. But, like many fascists since, they discovered that the very people they declared subhuman were actually full of talent, intelligence and drive. Unfortunately, it didn't stop their murderous campaign. But it did allow one female test pilot, Countess Melitta von Stauffenberg, to save most of her family.  And if von Stauffenberg is tickling your memory but you can't remember why, she was related to the famous Colonel Claus von Staffenberg of Operation Valkyrie fame. She even took part in the attempted assassination of Hitler with him.  Here is the story of Nazi Germany's greatest test pilot who was actually a Jewish woman  Born and educated as Melitta Schiller  Melitta Schiller came into the world around 1905 in Krotoschin, Prussia. Her father, of Jewish descent, served in the Prussian civil service. Her mother was a protestant, and both were ethnically German. After World War I, the newly formed Poland was inhospitable to most Germans and the family moved to Germany.  Melitta proved herself in athletics and mathematics and moved in 1922 to study science and the mathematics of aviation. She shone in school, inventing prototype instruments and testing them herself. She went into the aviation industry and became a pioneer of propeller design and rocket propulsion despite a crash landing in France. Farmers who rushed to her aid reportedly kept asking her where the pilot of the plane was because they couldn't believe it was a woman.  During the rise of Hitler and the Nazis, Schiller's employer fired her under pressure. About the same time, she attracted the eye of Count Alexander Schenk von Stauffenberg and married, becoming a countess herself.  The countess returns to the air  The woman now known as Litta von Stauffenberg quickly found new employment as her flying skills were well known. She achieved the rank of test pilot and worked on experimental planes and techniques.  The Third Reich pressured von Stauffenberg into service for them. Litta quickly proved herself as a test pilot for dives and did work essential to the development of the Stuka dive bomber. She routinely flew a dozen or more dives per day and provided information on how to improve the plane and dive techniques.  Litta didn't do this out of the kindness of her heart or out of patriotism. She hated Hitler and the Reich. But her family's safety explicitly rested on her successes as well as her brother's, Otto. In 1943, Reichsmarshall Hermann Goering awarded her the Iron Cross Second Class. In 1944, the Third Reich declared her, her brother Otto, and their two sisters to be ""equal to Aryans"" in the eyes of the Reich.  Stuka Ju 87Ds in October 1943.  An attempt on Hitler  But the countess knew what her work was enabling. And the continued subjugation and murder of millions of Jewish people in the Holocaust weighed heavily on her. Her brother-in-law, the German army Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, came to her with a proposal. If he could put together a plan to kill Adolph Hitler, would she deliver him to and from the assassination?  Melitta quickly agreed, but there was a wrinkle in the plan. Hitler's headquarters was remote and had bad options for landing strips. She was confident she could do it with a Fieseler plane, named for a stork. But Fieseler planes are slow and require frequent re-fueling. It was a terrible choice for escaping an assassination.  Claus ended up making the attempt without her, smuggling a bomb in a briefcase into a staff meeting with Hitler. He managed to place it properly and get away, but someone moved the briefcase behind a table leg after he left. The table leg absorbed a lot of the blast and Hitler survived.  The fallout  Two of Melitta's brothers-in-law, Claus and Berthold, were suspected of being part of the plot and were executed. Claus died by firing squad and Berthold was executed by strangulation. Melitta, her husband, and her parents were all arrested.  Melitta was soon released, however. The Nazis treated her loved ones relatively lightly in prisons and concentration camps, but the threat was clear. If Melitta ceased her work, slowed, or became a suspect of another assassination attempt, she and her family would be quickly executed.  Melitta continued her work, inventing a number of new devices and assisting in multiple plane designs, including the Messerschmitt-262 jet fighter. She used her medals and what prestige remained to get permission to visit family in concentration camps and prisons. In one case, this let her get better treatment for Claus's widow and children, including a daughter born after Claus's execution.  But as the Allies came to liberate Europe from the Nazis, they found Melitta in the air. On April 8, 1945, while Melitta flew to visit her husband, an American fighter spotted her. He quickly shot down her unarmed trainer aircraft. Countess Melitta von Staffenberg died of her wounds a few hours later.  While much of her work unfortunately benefited some of the worst people imaginable, Melitta was a pioneering and brilliant woman whose successes proved the folly of the Nazi's ridiculous racial views.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndlYXJldGhlbWlnaHR5LmNvbS9oaXN0b3J5L25hemktZ2VybWFueXMtZ3JlYXRlc3QtdGVzdC1waWxvdC13YXMtYS1qZXdpc2gtd29tYW4v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Sonko is scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday in a legal showdown that has sparked tensions in the West African country.  His trial opened on May 16 but was immediately adjourned until May 23 after he failed to attend.  ""The day I am given guarantees, I will come to Dakar and on Tuesday I will be in court. If all the (security) conditions are met, I will be there,"" he said in an interview on television Friday night.  In Dakar, the police ""made me suffer violence, brutality.

Sonko, president of the PASTEF-Patriots party, came in third in the 2019 election against incumbent Macky Sall, and intends to stand again next year.  Sonko said he did not receive a summons for his trial over the alleged rape of an employee at a beauty salon where he went for a massage.  The 48-year-old, who was also recently sentenced to a six-month suspended prison sentence for defamation and insults against the tourism minister, has denied the charge.  He says the legal cases against him are a plot aimed at barring him from contesting the 2024 vote.  Supporters of Sonko clashed with police on Monday and Tuesday in the southern city of Ziguinchor, where he is mayor.  There was also unrest in the capital Dakar and elsewhere. Authorities reported three deaths but the connection with the clashes was not clear.  Political tensions have also been stoked by Sall's refusal to rule out running for a third term as president, a move his opponents say would be unconstitutional.  Story continues  Senegal is traditionally a beacon of stability in troubled West Africa, but in recent years has been buffeted by turbulence that has at times turned deadly.

A review of records maintained by Open Sanctions showed that Van Ingen is the first Dutch citizen to be added to one of the U.S. sanctions lists. He told Follow the Money that his father did business in Russia for decades. After he died, the younger Van Ingen picked up where he left off, but stopped making deliveries to Russia after the war began.  Van Ingen also does not try to evade restrictions by sending shipments to intermediary countries, like China or Turkey, he stated. He runs several Dutch businesses, including a business material wholesaler, and providing company administration to small businesses. Follow the Money said he also owns mediation firm Ronin Management BV, for which he was sanctioned. The company has an estimated balance sheet reflecting about 10 million euros.  “I have never done anything that the Ministry of Economic Affairs does not know about,” he told the publication. ""I was not approached by anyone from the U.S., nor by The Hague,"" he added. ""I'm getting negative attention now, this is what the U.S. is making of it, but I haven't done anything wrong."" His other companies have also been sanctioned, specifically Pro Rata Solutions B.V. and Delta Technical and Scientific Instruments B.V. Like Van Ingen, these were sanctioned under Executive Order 14024. The names were among those added to a list maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control strictly because of Van Ingen's involvement. Neither he nor his companies can do business with an American entity, the Treasury Department said.  ""I haven't been able to think about the consequences yet,"" Van Ingen stated.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vbmx0aW1lcy5ubC8yMDIzLzA1LzE5L2ZpcnN0LWR1dGNoLWNpdGl6ZW4tYWRkZWQtdXMtc2FuY3Rpb25zLWxpc3QtdGFyZ2V0aW5nLXJ1c3NpYdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2023-06-01","Not Discerned","{""Jackson"", ""Mississippi"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T22:43:00","JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - Leaders with the Jackson Convention Center are taking over management of the facility in-house, cutting ties with the company that’s been in charge of it for more than two years.  On Friday, the Capital City Convention Center Commission announced that it was taking over operations of the facility, saying they’re following a pattern similar to other cities.  “OVG stabilized the center after the COVID-19 pandemic and we are thankful for their partnership,” Commission Chair Fred Banks said. “But now, we are excited to move into a new chapter with Cherre Miller as general manager.”  “Her experience and expertise in running facilities, specifically the JCC, is unmatched.”  Miller was tapped to take over management of the center recently. She was unavailable for comment Friday afternoon.  Commission attorney Charlene Priester said the decision to end its agreement with OVC was amicable and had been in the works for months.  “OVG and the Convention Center have been in talks about the center’s financial difficulties for a while now. I believe it was in early April when they reached a final decision,” she said.  OVG, also known as Oak View Group, is a venue management firm based in Los Angeles.  The company was hired to take over the struggling convention center in 2020, according to the Northside Sun.  It was not known how much time OVG had left in its contract or how much the city would have to pay to end the agreement.  “There are still some fees owed to OVG and we are working out the details now,” Priester said. “They did make an investment in Jackson.”  The center will now be managed by convention center employees, who will be overseen by the commission and Visit Jackson, the city’s tourism bureau.  “No employees are losing their jobs,” Priester said. “One person asked to be transferred with OVG and that was accomplished.”  The decision to end the agreement is a cost-saving measure for Jackson and the Convention Center itself, which was struggling financially even before the COVID pandemic.  “Since COVID and the shutdown of the entire nation, we’ve had struggles trying to operate in a manner that kept all the bills paid,” Priester said. “But the Convention Center has made great progress in trying to come out.”  She pointed to the Two Rivers Black-Tie Gala, a benefit for Tougaloo College held at the center on May 5, as well as the upcoming Voices of Courage and Justice event, commemorating the 60th anniversary of the assassination of civil rights leader Medgar Evers, slated for June.  The Jackson Convention Center opened in 2009, years after the completion of the Telcom Center on Pascagoula Street, the Clarion-Ledger reported at the time.  It was billed as a venue that could help revitalize downtown Jackson and generate new business for the capital city.  However, efforts to fulfill those promises have been hampered by the lack of an adjoining convention hotel and poor parking.  Last summer, former convention center manager Mark Arancibia told WLBT at least one event organizer was considering leaving Jackson if the parking situation was not improved.  Convention center parking is located across the street from the 330,000-square-foot facility.  The uneven concrete slabs that characterize the lot stand in stark contrast to the modern building, with large plate-glass windows and a contemporary design.  The Capital City Convention Center Commission is partnering with Visit Jackson to manage the convention center. The work previously was done by a third-party management firm. (WLBT)  Yolanda Clay-Moore, director of communications with Visit Jackson, told WLBT other event organizers won’t consider Jackson at all because of the lack of an adjoining hotel.  “When we answer the question, that we don’t have a connecting property, that automatically ends all further talks of having that event in our city,” she said.  The city is hoping to rectify that situation. This spring, Jackson issued a request for proposals/qualifications for companies to conduct a feasibility study and market analysis of the Central Business District in downtown Jackson to determine if the area could support a hotel and parking garage.  Three companies responded to the city’s request and those proposals were being evaluated, Jackson Director of Communications Melissa Faith Payne said in late April.  Once those proposals are reviewed, a vendor will be chosen to move forward with the work, she said.  In the meantime, the city’s tourism officials are hopeful the decision to manage the facility in-house will mean more events and more visitors coming into Jackson.  Said Priester, “We believe, like other cities that self-manage, this not a bad pivot.”  Want more WLBT news in your inbox? Click here to subscribe to our newsletter.

"assassination","1842-11-28","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T23:06:01","This was the fifth time that she had been attacked since her 1837 ascension to the throne. Media accounts often emphasised her coolness. The Morning Post reported that ""her Majesty betrayed no feeling of alarm"" and had the ""complete self-possession"" to courteously acknowledge groups of cheering spectators as her carriage made its way back to Buckingham Palace.  This description of the Queen as resilient, unflappable, and committed to duty chimes with her popular image, both then and now. Victoria's famous quote – ""we are not amused"" – may never have passed her lips, but it has come to symbolise the sangfroid of the Queen and the mood of an era. Many people imagine the 19th Century as a time of repressed emotions, while others celebrate its supposed stoicism. (Read more about the origins of the ""stiff upper lip"".)  Despite her public façade, Victoria's personal journals reveal an emotional side. Looking back on the attack from the safety of Buckingham Palace, she wrote that it now seemed ""like a horrid dream"". As her account of the incident unfolded, fear and confusion gave way to anger, and she came to see the ""outrage"" as ""the most disgraceful and cowardly thing that has ever been done"". Victoria wasn't the only one to feel some emotion. Prince Albert was ""dreadfully shocked"", while Sir George Grey, the home secretary at the time, arrived at Buckingham Palace ""greatly distressed & in tears"". In the hours after the attack, Victoria was still ""shaken, nervous, & unable to eat"".  Still, she ventured to the opera where joyful crowds threw their hats in the air and serenaded her with spontaneous renditions of ""God Save The Queen"". While not all Victorians were enthusiastic monarchists, attacks on the Queen prompted these outpourings of emotion. As Victoria herself quipped, ""it is worth being shot at to learn how much one is loved"".  Her determination not to hide away in the wake of the attacks was typical of Victoria in her younger years. Back in 1842, a teenage boy named John Francis had pointed a pistol at her carriage as it drove up Constitution Hill. Albert spotted him, but Francis didn't fire and managed to slip away. Knowing that a potential assassin was on the loose, Prime Minster Robert Peel urged the Queen to stay at home while his new police force hunted the attacker. Victoria refused. The next evening, she and Albert rode out in their open-top carriage flanked by guards but still exposed. Sure enough, Francis made another attempt, this time managing to fire his pistol at the royal couple moments before being seized by a policeman. Victoria emerged unhurt, but it could have ended very differently.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vZnV0dXJlL2FydGljbGUvMjAyMzA1MTktaG93LWFzc2Fzc2lucy1yZXZlYWxlZC1hLWhpZGRlbi1zaWRlLXRvLXF1ZWVuLXZpY3Rvcmlh0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"assassination","2023-11-03","Not Discerned","{""Beirut"", ""Beirut"", ""Lebanon""}","2023-05-19T12:16:47","It seems that Saudi Arabia still considers the improvement of relations with Damascus as a realistic option and a way to guarantee its wider regional interests.  Saudi Arabia is no longer waiting for America's green light in regional positioning, though this does not mean crossing the American red line.  Riyadh and Damascus were in rival camps in the 1950s and 1960s. After 1963, Syria's relations with Saudi Arabia have undergone periodic fluctuations. After the challenges in the 1980s, the two countries' relations improved in the 1990s, but the assassination of Rafik Hariri in Lebanon, and Riyadh's support to the anti-government factions in Syria (2008) soured bilateral relations.  Despite improved ties in 2009, Saudi-Syrian relations deteriorated after the start of the war on Syria. Saudi Arabia severed its ties with Syria by closing the embassy in Damascus and expelled the Syrian ambassador in 2012. However, the signs and events of the past year indicate improving relations between the two countries.  Developments such as stopping critical statements by officials, stopping media criticism by both countries, sending a delegation from Syria to the Saudi capital, the presence of the Syrian Tourism Minister in Riyadh, and Bashar Al-Assad's meeting with the Saudi delegation in Damascus, have been signs that point to the clear improvement of relations between the two countries.  The recent visit of Prince Faisal Bin Farhan, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Saudi Arabia to Damascus after the visit of Faisal Mekdad, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Syria to Jeddah was the first very important event in the process of normalization of relations since 2011.  International and regional political motivations and variables  In fact, further multipolarity attempts were detected in the international system; meanwhile, Riyadh was taking new steps toward Moscow and China. All these developments have played an important role in normalizing the relations between Syria and Saudi Arabia. Part of the recent negotiations for the normalization of Saudi-Syrian relations were held in Moscow, and China welcomed the agreement of Saudi Arabia and Syria to reopen the embassies.  Russia has tried to reduce tensions and encourage Saudi Arabia to support the readmission of Syria to the Arab League, which softened Riyadh's position toward Syria. In another dimension, less presence in the Middle East is in Washington's favor, and Washington has paid attention to evaluating its policies toward Damascus by maintaining sanctions and avoiding the normalization of relations.  However, Saudi Arabia is no longer waiting for America's green light in regional positioning, though this does not mean crossing the American red line. In fact, the return of the Saudi Arabian ambassador to Syria does not constitute a violation of US sanctions.  Saudi Arabia's normalization with Iran has also played an important role in improving relations between Riyadh and Damascus. The agreement between Saudi Arabia and Iran, with the mediation of China and its multilateral consequences in the Middle East, accelerated the improvement of Syrian-Saudi relations.  In addition, the previous compromises between Yemen-Saudi Arabia, Egypt-Qatar, Egypt-Turkey, Qatar-Bahrain, etc., each, in turn, have been motivations for improving Riyadh-Damascus relations. Strengthening Egyptian-Syrian relations is also an incentive for the return of Syrian-Saudi relations.  Apart from this, the change in the approach of the Arab countries regarding Syria and the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between countries such as the UAE, Jordan, etc. with Syria has made Damascus and Riyadh more eager to reopen their embassies and resume flights. Also, the increasing will of countries for Damascus to rejoin the Arab League (which suspended Syria's membership in 2011), has pushed Riyadh to reduce tensions with Damascus. The Arab League's decision to readmit Syria after 12 year, was an important symbolic victory for Damascus with the help of Riyadh.  Since the summer of 2017, and following the Riyadh summit, Saudi Arabia has gradually separated itself from the Syrian opposition. From Damascus' point of view, cutting off financial aid to the militias and Riyadh's, ""open and realistic policies"" are in the interest of Syria. In fact, the reduction and disconnection of Riyadh's communication with the opposition of Damascus have led to the restoration of relations and focus to ""maintaining the unity of Syria"".  In addition, greater rapprochement regarding the integrity of Syrian lands, the return of Syrian refugees, the provision of sufficient infrastructure, the beginning of the reconstruction of Syria by providing Arab and international aid, and the expulsion of Turkish forces from Syria away from Resolution 2254, have all improved relations. With a new approach toward Syria, Riyadh wants to close the case of Saudi detainees in Syria. This cooperation can lead to other dimensions of anti-terrorism security issues. Like Egypt and the UAE, Riyadh hopes to limit the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood through its cooperation of Damascus.  Economic and cultural motivations and factors  Despite the difference in the type of systems, both countries have an Islamic-Arab identity. This can improve the relations between Syria and Saudi Arabia, so a gradual improvement in relations based on Arab commonalities could be an opportunity for Syria and Saudi Arabia in the region.  Damascus will need Saudi lobbying and assistance to reduce US sanctions against Syria and allow investment in the country. Even now, Damascus hopes Riyadh will help in the reconstruction of Syria, create conditions for the return of Syrian refugees, provide sufficient infrastructure, and start the reconstruction of Syria by providing Arab and international aid.  In fact, by improving and normalizing relations, Saudi Arabia and its allies can contribute to the reconstruction of Syria with a significant investment. Also, improving relations helps to provide a suitable platform for more trade between Syria and the Arab world.  Before 2011, Saudi Arabia was one of the most important trading partners of Syria. Saudi Arabia also wants to focus on domestic projects with the aim of diversifying its economy and increasing its exports. In this situation, the volume of trade can be increased by reviving direct flights and consular services and political rapprochement.  The perspective of relationships  Syria and Saudi Arabia are taking steps to open consular services and flights between the two countries. It seems that Saudi Arabia still considers the improvement of relations with Damascus as a realistic option and a way to guarantee its wider regional interests.  In the meantime, the slow improvement of diplomatic, economic, tourism, and cultural relations and the continuation of talks to improve ties provide the basis for a step-by-step return to the 1990s level of relations. But ties are still far from complete normalization, and the conclusion of a bilateral strategic agreement requires the overcoming of multiple challenges.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vZW5nbGlzaC5hbG1heWFkZWVuLm5ldC9hcnRpY2xlcy9hbmFseXNpcy9tb3RpdmVzLWFuZC1mYWN0b3JzLWluZmx1ZW5jaW5nLXRoZS1pbXByb3ZlbWVudC1vZi1zeXJpYW4tc2HSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The two sneak in but soon hear Kang-ho at the door. They hide in a cabinet and hear Kang-ho scolding Lion, the piglet, as he believes Lion created the mess because the house is also covered with poop.  A man on a motorcycle enters Kang-ho’s house and attempts to kill him. He fails as the CEO Song’s men leap from the closet and try to chase him down. They see a tattoo on the assassin’s arm but fail to catch him. Young-soon returns home and sees the mess.

Meanwhile, the Artist, Baek Hoon-ah, visits the chief villager, Son Yong-rak’s house. It turns out that the duo were classmates. After catching up, he talks about having trouble with Young-soon.  Young-soon tells Kang-ho that she’s going to the marketplace while they both watch the news about the foot-and-mouth disease. Kang-ho quietly says that he will see Young-soon later then. Young-soon smiles fondly and says that he always used to beg her to take him with her.  As Kang-ho tries making excuses, Young-soon says she knows he wants to play with Ye-jin and Seo-jin but asks him to stay out of trouble. Things look bright for Mi-joo in The Good Bad Mother episode 6 as Geum-ja gives her passbook and stamp to Mi-joo, asking her to open her own shop. Mi-joo is emotional and thankful. She goes to the town to search for a place she can rent.  Meanwhile, Kang-ho ends up following Mi-joo to town after he sees her accidentally drop her wallet. He goes to the location Mi-joo had asked the AI on her phone and searches for her. Mi-joo meets with a real estate agent. Young-soon is also in the same neighborhood, buying shoes for Kang-ho.

She stops in front of an aquarium and remembers Kang-ho. The present Kang-ho sees her standing but loses her as a vehicle blocks his view.  Mi-joo reaches an agricultural chemicals shop to buy herbicide. She notices a small space in the shop. She advises an elderly lady on how to take care of her nails, and her friends strike a deal by letting Mi-joo open a shop-in-shop with the chemical shop owner.  A thief tries to steal Mi-joo’s wallet from Kang-ho’s jacket but fails as Kang-ho catches him by throwing an apple at him. He repeats, “hit a home run or strikeout,” which was the motto of CEO Song unknowingly.  Other shopkeepers around the incident pick a fight with Kang-ho to compensate them. Mi-joo sees the altercation and intervenes. Young-soon also stumbles upon them. She then drives the duo home.  The Good Bad Mother episode 6 also shows glimpses of Kang-ho remembering his memories in bits and pieces. In the car, Kang-ho repeats “Bar Exam Meal,” which is the name Mi-joo embroidered on Kang-ho’s lunch bag. She is shocked to hear it while Young-soon beats him, as she thinks he said a bad word.

Hoon-ah tricks them into believing that he will create a massive concert hall in Jou-ri, giving everyone a chance to boost their business. The locals agree to protest against Young-soon’s pig farm. Young-soon hears this when she goes to give them supplements but is heartbroken.  She goes to the farm as one pig goes into labor. Kang-ho is left on his own to deliver some of the supplements, and he delivers them at Sam-sik’s place. Nearby, he tries to fish for Mi-joo. Sam-sik, unknown to Kang-ho’s troubles, sees him.  We then see a flashback where The Good Bad Mother episode 6 reveals what went wrong between Sam-sik and Kang-ho. Sam-sik meets Kang-ho at a company dinner. The stark difference in class is apparent between the two. Kang-ho is naturally frustrated with him. Sometime later, Sam-sik is seen pleading with Kang-ho for help. However, he refuses to do so.  liesel @eunjiniverse  Ep6 ok we all know samsik is such a silly guy and talks too much all times but he just genuinely asked kangho how has he been here 🥲 #TheGoodBadMother #TheGoodBadMother Ep6 ok we all know samsik is such a silly guy and talks too much all times but he just genuinely asked kangho how has he been here 🥲 #TheGoodBadMother#TheGoodBadMotherEp6 https://t.co/MpBiYYSuu8  Cut to the present, Sam-sik and seven-year-old amnesiac Kang-ho get into a verbal fight. Kang-ho goes to the twins to get the help of their scary father. Mi-joo opens the door, and the kids talk to him as well. Learning that he is alone for the night, as Young-soon would stay at the farm for the pigs’ birth, they invite him to dinner.

Mi-joo is teary-eyed and tells Kang-ho never to meet them. Kang-ho asks Mi-joo if he was ever a bad person to her. As she doesn’t reply, he says that he thinks he was.  Meanwhile, village chief Yon-rak finds the bagful of supplements Young-soon got him and feels bad. Elsewhere, CEO Song’s men try searching the pig farm for evidence. They stumble upon Young-soon and lie about starting their own farm. As they begin to leave, Young-soon falls down in pain.  Kang-ho wakes up in the middle of his sleep, sensing something is wrong. He calls for Young-soon but gets no reply.  On the other hand, Mi-joo takes turns patting Ye-jin and Seo-jin and seems lost in thought. Geum-ja remembers the day Mi-joo and Kang-ho were born and how it sealed her and Young-soon’s friendship. She is also reminded of Young-soon reciprocating the support when Geum-ja’s husband passed away.  The Good Bad Mother episode 6 also shows the heartbreaking backstory of Young-soon. In a flashback, we see a young Young-soon packing a gimbap for her brother, mother, and father, who were going to her dad’s company picnic. The family seems to have a close bond. However, as Young-soon turns, the car gets into a devastating accident that leaves her alone.  Remembering the past, Young-soon wakes up in a cold sweat. The next morning, Kang-ho searches for Young-soon everywhere, like she had taught him to. He calls her as a last resort, and we see a nurse answering the phone.  On the other hand, the locals betray Hoon-ah and do not participate in the protest against Young-soon’s pig farm after giving him excuses.  Meanwhile, a doctor asks Young-soon about her family members several times. Youn-soon smiles and says there’s no one with her and asks the doctor to tell her her diagnosis. The doctor reveals that Young-soon has stage 4 stomach cancer.  Young-soon is in denial and continues to laugh, repeating that she only had indigestion. The realization strikes, and she begs on her knees to save her, as Kang-ho needs her.  The Good Bad Mother episode 6 ends with Kang-ho racing towards a pale Young-soon in the hospital. He falls from the wheelchair after bumping into a guy. Young-soon tries to lift him up, but her body fails her. Dejected and angry, she yells at a confused Kang-ho to get up on his own and walks away.  리리 ♡ 🐷⚽️ @blueskypallette  Ep6  #TheGoodBadMother Kangho and his lost face when his mom told him to get up on his own.. bcs youngsoon made up her mind, as she diagnosed to be sick. she cannot be near and help kangho all the time.. this is so sad and why this trope #TheGoodBadMother Ep6 Kangho and his lost face when his mom told him to get up on his own.. bcs youngsoon made up her mind, as she diagnosed to be sick. she cannot be near and help kangho all the time.. this is so sad and why this trope 😭#TheGoodBadMotherEp6#TheGoodBadMother https://t.co/j6lSHjN67f  The Good Bad Mother episode 6 brought forth a twist that not many expected.

Days after being branded a sex offender and fined $5 million in a civil trial, former president Donald Trump allegedly wants to appear happily married for his 2014 run at the White House. Only a week after stablemate 'Globe' reported that Melania was ""moving out"" in a trial separation, the 'Enquirer' now claims their ""$3.2 billion divorce drama"" is on hold, after Trump bought her off with a ""new deal on his will, prenup & allowance!""  In exchange for Melania's public support, Trump has reportedly given her an improved prenup deal, more spending money, and boosted the inheritance bequeathed to their son Barron, aged 17.  If the story is true, Melania is gambling big on Trump regaining the presidency. If he fails, he risks greater exposure to numerous criminal lawsuits, which could put him behind bars, bringing his empire crumbling down, making it hard for Melania to get any money amid a likely flood of creditors.  ""What Her Majesty Really Thought About Meghan.""  The Queen privately called Duchess Meghan ""evil,"" an unnamed source told Britain's 'Spectator.'  Apparently this raised eyebrows because it's not the sort of language the Queen typically used. Perhaps it was meant as a compliment?  ""New Daddy De Niro Hears Wedding Bells!""  At the age of 79, with the birth of his seventh child by his latest lover, why would he do that?  ""Docs Destroyed Meg Ryan's Face!""  The 'Enquirer' thinks she's had too much plastic surgery. The actress's rep calls such stories ""completely fabricated.""  ""Hollywood Horror Show! Strikes may spell end of today's TV!""  With brazen self-interest, the rag tells readers: ""It's time to put down the remote and subscribe to The National Enquirer,"" because ""the crippling writers' strike may be the death knell for television as we know it.""  Right. We're entering the dawn of a new age of tabloid journalism, rising from the ashes of outmoded television.  ""CIA Assassins Took Out JFK!""  A week after claiming that vice present Lyndon B Johnson had President Kennedy killed, the rag quotes Robert Kennedy Jr claiming there is ""overwhelming evidence"" that the CIA was ""involved"" in the assassination. RFK Jr is a leading anti-vax campaigner, so he's clearly adept at reasoned argument and weighing the facts.  ""Hollywood Braces For Foxx Farewell!""  Actor Jamie Foxx's daughter says he's recovering from a health scare and playing pickleball; the 'Enquirer' says he is ""beyond help"" as friends prepare their ""final goodbyes.""  Someone's got it wrong.  'Globe'  ""Epstein Dirty Diaries Found!"" screams the cover.  The late convicted billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein's diaries allegedly reveal his ""A-list inner circle.""  But Epstein pals Prince Andrew, Bill Clinton, Donald Trump and Bill Gates are apparently not mentioned in his diaries, which record planned meetings with lesser luminaries such as current CIA chief William Burns, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman, Swiss banking CEO Ariane de Rothschild, and MIT's Noam Chomsky. But there's nothing to suggest that any of them were involved in any of Epstein's sex crimes, or had anything other than business dealings with him. American Symphony Orchestra conductor Leon Botstein, named in the diaries, claims he met Epstein in an unsuccessful fundraising bid.  Shocking.  Or, as the 'Globe' puts it in its headline: ""The Worms Under Epstein's Rocks!""  ""Tom Cruise Falls Hard For Sexy Shakira!""  They met at the Miami Grand Prix on May 7, which is enough for the 'Globe' to be hearing wedding bells.  ""King Hits Meghan Where It Hurts!""  Rather than a swift tolchock to the face, King Charles has allegedly inflicted maximum suffering on Duchess Meghan . . . by making a cameo appearance with Queen Camilla on 'American Idol.' (That's old-school TV, of the sort soon to vanish from the face of the tabloid-dominated Earth.)  ""He delivered a very direct message to the Sussexes: Don't mess with me!"" says an unnamed ""palace source,"" who must surely have lost his or her mind. ""It was a master-stroke of one-upmanship.""  As if Meghan would feel threatened because Charles is appearing on television.  ""The royal gloves are off,"" a ""senior courtier"" supposedly said. ""He has taken control and is showing his rebel son and daughter-in-law who's boss.""  Do 'Globe' readers seriously believe this is how courtiers talk? 'Globe' reporters clearly think so.  ""Beyoncé Hubby Dogged For Paternity Test.""  A 30-year-old Jersey man claims to be Jay Z's love child, and is seeking a paternity test. The case has already been rejected by the New Jersey Supreme Court, and another man is named as father on the claimant's birth certificate. It's hard to imagine why Jay-Z won't agree to a paternity test.  ""Is This Ancient Statue Proof of Time Travel?""  The 'Globe' displays a photo of an ancient Greek funerary relief from the Getty Museum in California, which ""appears to show woman using laptop computer.""  Or, as the Getty puts it: ""a woman reaches out to lift the lid of a shallow box held by an attendant.""  Someone's got it wrong.  'People'  ""What Really happened to Anna Nicole Smith?"" asks its cover story.  More than 16 years after the model's drug overdose death, a new documentary tells the same story we've always heard, but also questions whether her childhood was quite as traumatic as she had claimed.  Her friend and former lover, Missy Byrum, states bluntly: ""She made a lot of stuff up."" Smith allegedly had a moderately happy childhood, but appropriated Byrum's own tales of childhood abuse as her own.  Byrum, a fellow stripper who claims she lived with and married Smith, says she walked away when Smith's drug habit became overwhelming: ""She needed more love than any one human being could give her.""  ""Halle Bailey's Big Splash!""  The star puts a ""fresh spin"" on Disney princess 'The Little Mermaid.' ""Fresh spin"" meaning she's Black. It's not as if her Ariel is a misunderstood trans mermaid with body dysmorphia hailing from the wrong side of the reef.  ""Sting – Songs of My Life.""  The 71-year-old rocker reveals what songs meant to him when he wrote them. 'Every Breath You Take' ""could be sinister, or it could be quite warm and sweet and nice . . . Whatever your interpretation is is perfectly valid,"" he says. Yes, that song played at so many weddings is about a possessive stalker; Sting's just too polite to say.  'Us Weekly'  'The Little Mermaid"" is this week's cover girl beneath the headline: ""Halle Bailey Makes a Splash.""  The aquatic star talks about fame and overcoming racism in the Disney role.  ""Ariel helped me find my voice,"" she says. Being cast as the lead in a Disney movie will also do that to you.  Thankfully we have the crack investigative team at 'Us Weekly' to tell us that Rachel Weisz wore it best, that David Hasselhoff is ""dying to go to China because I want to see if they'd recognize me"" – apparently said without any trace of irony, or any semblance of self-awareness – and that the stars are just like us: they eat junk food at sports games, paradoxically read the ingredient labels on food packages, and ride the subway.

Tiger Eye PI said in the statement that one of its investigators, Ahmed Suale, was killed on the same day he had had engagements with the Attorney General’s office on his testimony against the accused person in this same case, so it is not prepared to lose any more of its investigators.  Nyantakyi is facing prosecution following an undercover investigative documentary by Tiger Eye PI, which captured him taking bribe and engaging in influence peddling.  ADVERTISEMENT  Read the full statement by Tiger Eye P.I below:  NYANTAKYI AND LAWYERS TO SEE ANAS’S FACE BEFORE COURT PROCEEDINGS  RE: REPUBLIC V. KWESI NYANTAKYI AND ANOTHER  1. Tiger Eye P.I has taken notice of the ruling by the High Court sitting in Accra to allow undercover journalist Anas Aremeyaw Anas to testify wearing mask in open court on condition that he shows his face to the accused person in the judges’ chambers first.  2.Anas had earlier agreed to testify as a witness for the prosecution in the above styled case after Ahmed Hussein Suale was gruesomely murdered, on condition that his identity is protected.  ADVERTISEMENT  3.Anas’s request for the protection of his identity stems from his role as an undercover agent and the real and elevated risk that revealing his identity to the accused person will severely compromise his physical security and personal safety.  4.It should be recalled that the late Ahmed Hussein Suale, a star witness in this case, was assassinated in broad daylight in 2019. His assassination occurred on the same day that he had had engagements with the Attorney General’s office on his testimony against the accused person in above styled case.  5.Prior to his gruesome murder, the late Ahmed Suale had been threatened with death by Mr Kwesi Nyantakyi and had been the subject of callous media attacks for his role as a star witness in the case, culminating in the revealing of his identity on national television and social media by Mr Kennedy Agyapong, the MP for Assin-Central constituency.  6.As much as Anas is willing and ready to testify for the prosecution, doing so under the condition specified by the court, presents a clear and present danger to his security and safety, especially because of the issues chronicled above.  7.Under these circumstances, prudence requires that he declines the invitation to endanger his life and accordingly declines the invitation to reveal his identity to the accused person in the judges’ chamber or any other place.  ADVERTISEMENT  8.Tiger Eye endorses the position of Anas and states that it is proper and wise to err on the side of caution to avoid any potential attack on another of its investigators.  9.Tiger Eye’s position is further buttressed by the unrelenting, coordinated, and well-financed media and other campaigns by private and State actors to undermine its operations and the Anas principle, which stand in their way of amassing corruption and social injustice.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB1bHNlLmNvbS5naC9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2ktd29udC10ZXN0aWZ5LWFnYWluc3QtbnlhbnRha3lpLWJlY2F1c2UtaW0tbm90LXByZXBhcmVkLXRvLXNob3ctaGltLW15LWZhY2UtYW5hcy92NTQya3h00gGBAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB1bHNlLmNvbS5naC9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2ktd29udC10ZXN0aWZ5LWFnYWluc3QtbnlhbnRha3lpLWJlY2F1c2UtaW0tbm90LXByZXBhcmVkLXRvLXNob3ctaGltLW15LWZhY2UtYW5hcy92NTQya3h0LmFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

In an interactive session with journalists, Mr Khan said, ""Today, a Punjab government delegation came to meet me, and they gave me eight names, who they said were wanted men."" Everyone in the PTI was currently wanted, he added.  ""The authorities have apprised me of conducting a search operation at Zaman Park's residence, but I have refused to do so. They can come as per permission given by the Lahore High Court (LHC),"" he maintained.  The LHC ordered to form a two-member government team comprising a lady police officer,and the PTI member to aid for the search operation, he said.  Mr Khan asked for evidence regarding his party's involvement in the May 9 violence, saying that if anyone from the PTI was involved, he will help [the police] catch them.  Read also: Police arrest PTI leader Imran Ismail in Karachi  But this is not the case, adding that this is being done to crush PTI,he said. How could they arrest 7,500 people, he questioned. ""There are videos of Shah Mahmood Qureshi and Yasmin Rashid asking people to be peaceful,"" he claimed.  Claiming the arrests of PTI leaders and workers were a crackdown against the PTI, Mr Khan added, ""This is not happening for the enforcement of law in the country. All this is happening to crush the party"".  He claimed the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) was isolated, Mr Khan said, “A political party or a leader becomes isolated when he does not have the support of the people"".  Mr Khan was of the view that the government would be charged under Article 6 for delaying the polls in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.  Speaking about the Supreme Court (SC), Mr Khan claimed, ""Despite all the differences in the apex court, all judges agree on the point that elections should be held within 90 days"".  Believing that the government was ""petrified"" of elections, the deposed premier said, ""The PDM is afraid of holding elections because it lost the by-elections despite the support of stakeholders. Now it [PDM] is running away from the elections"".  ""The government is looking for ways to plan to bring me and the PTI into conflict with the army,"" Mr Khan maintained.  Earlier today, Mr Khan reiterated that he would not bow down to anyone.  Taking to Twitter, the deposed prime minister fired a fresh salvo at the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), saying, ""PTI and its supporters have been subjected to the worst crackdown and terror today"".  He said that the kind of demonstration that was taking place in the current regime did not happen even during the tenure of Ziaul Haq and Pervez Musharraf.  On Thursday, Mr Khan lambasted his political opponents and asked the nation to stand up for its rights.  Taking to Twitter, the ousted premier slammed the PDM, saying, ""A gang of thugs and criminals is dominating the country"".  He lamented, ""Amidst the deep economic woes and challenges faced by rising unemployment, the rulers are using their power to eliminate the country's leading political party through a fascist approach.""  - Embattled Imran vows to keep fighting -  PTI chief Imran Khan said he will keep fighting for the sake of“real freedom” even if he was left alone.  His statement came as prominent PTI leaders including former federal minister for national health services Aamer Mehmood Kiani and former federal minister for environment Malik Amin Aslam announced quitting the party citing the party’s involvement in May 9 attacks on “security installations” as reason, with others demanding Mr Khan to condemn the attacks openly.  At an interactive session with journalists at his Zaman Park residence, he said “Don’t you dare think that I’ll step back due to pressure”.

Delivering a speech at the book launch of his title ""Centres of Power: My Years in the Prime Minister's Office and Security Council"" at India International Centre, New Delhi, the former career diplomat who had also served as Advisor to PM on Foreign Affairs from 1981-1986 said ""domestic reasons play a very significant role in international diplomacy"" while talking about New Delhi's stand on Gulf War.  Remembering his days at the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) where he served as an advisor to both former PM Indira Gandhi and his son Rajiv Gandhi, Gharekhan said, ""Indira Gandhi was not a difficult person as it was shown. She was both kind and tough and always respected the opinions of the officials.""  ""But Rajiv Gandhi was different. His style of working was very different from his mother's. Rajiv Gandhi many a time was not very happy with IK Gujral's stand on several issues. He did not like when someone used to tell him that this is our policy which was decided by her mother, Indira Gandhi. He did not specifically like the term 'your mother', he further added.  Speaking on IK Gujral, Gharekhan said, ""When the Gulf War happened and Saddam invades Kuwait, IK Gujral was visiting Moscow, Iran and thought Saddam is India's friend. He thought Saddam could fight and win against the US and its allies. This was very embarrassing for us. And many of the officials at the MEA back then tried to sober him (IK Gujral) down. ""  Gharekhan, while talking about Indira Gandhi's assassination, pointed out that when the former PM was assassinated, ""there was no ambulance and that she was taken to the AIIMs in a private vehicle. At the hospital, there were no senior doctors to attend her and only junior doctors attended her. That was extremely terrifying and should not have happened.""  Gharekhan was sharing the dais with former Vice President Hamid Ansari, ex-Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran, former Ambassador and External Affairs Minister K Natwar Singh and former Foreign Secretary M K Rasgotra who is 99 years of age.  While speaking during the launch of the book, Hamid Ansari said PM Indira Gandhi's main concern was China and she wanted that India should not remain unrealistic on China in the international arena. Quoting a few lines from the book, he said, ""PM Indira Gandhi did not share the same equation with the Soviet Union as her father Nehru used to do.

"assassination","2023-05-03","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T20:06:00","First published by Common Dreams  The Pentagon said earlier this month, without providing evidence, that a U.S. drone strike in northwest Syria killed a “senior al-Qaeda leader.”  But U.S. military officials are now beginning to walk back the claim as the victim’s family insists the father of 10 had no connections to terrorist organizations and was herding his sheep when he was slain by a Hellfire missile on the morning of May 3.  Lotfi Hassan Misto, a 56-year-old former bricklayer, has been identified by his family as the victim of the drone strike, The Washington Post reported Thursday, citing interviews with the man’s brother, son, and several people who knew him.  “They described a kind, hard-working man whose ‘whole life was spent poor,'” the Post noted.  The operation that killed Misto, the Post reported, “was overseen by U.S. Central Command, which claimed hours after the strike, without citing evidence or naming a suspect, that the Predator drone strike had targeted a ‘senior al-Qaeda leader.’ But now there is doubt inside the Pentagon about who was killed.”  One unnamed U.S. military official told the newspaper that the Pentagon is “no longer confident” that the strike killed an al-Qaeda leader. Another official said that “though we believe the strike did not kill the original target, we believe the person to be al-Qaeda.”  The entire U.S. drone program, including the process by which officials choose their assassination targets, is shrouded in secrecy, and activists argue the program should be shuttered in its entirety.  Often described by the Pentagon as “precision” attacks, U.S. drone strikes have killed thousands of civilians in recent years—deaths that U.S. officials typically refuse to even acknowledge, let alone apologize for.  The Biden administration did apologize after killing 10 members of an Afghan family—including seven children—in a 2021 drone strike in Kabul, but the U.S. has yet to uphold its pledge to compensate the survivors. A U.S. Central Command report on the strike indicated that military officials knew the attack likely killed civilians but initially lied about it in public.  The aftermath of the May 3 drone strike in northwest Syria appears to be following a similar trajectory.  On the day of the deadly strike, the watchdog Airwars published an initial assessment noting that a “60-year-old male civilian was killed by a declared U.S. drone strike on the outskirts of Qurqaniya,” immediately disputing the Pentagon narrative.  Airwars pointed to a tweet from a Syrian journalist who said that contrary to CENTCOM’s statement, the man killed was a civilian with “no connection with any organization, neither now nor previously.”  Video footage given to the Post shows “a dozen people standing nearby” as aid workers arrived at the scene of the drone strike earlier this month, the newspaper reported.  “Most stare in shock,” the Post observed. “Some cry.”  Nearly a week after the strike, a CENTCOM spokesperson said the U.S. military was “aware of the allegations of a civilian casualty” and determining whether “further investigation is necessary and how it should proceed.”  Misto’s brother told the Associated Press at the time that the U.S. military’s claims that Misto had terrorist connections were “absolute lies,” decrying his killing as “an injustice and an aggression.”  “If they claim that he’s a terrorist, or that they got someone from al-Qaeda, they’re all liars,” Misto’s brother told the Post.  Analysts told the Post that the family’s insistence that Misto had no terrorist ties appears highly credible.  “Very quickly after this strike, the White Helmets came out and identified the individual with his name and his profession,” said Charles Lister, the director of Syria and Countering Terrorism and Extremism at the Middle East Institute.  “Locals came forward to say, this guy’s always been a farmer. He’s never had any political activities; he’s never had any affiliation with armed groups,” Lister added. “The pace and breadth of such pushback was actually quite unusual.”  Citing Jerome Drevon, a senior analyst on jihad and modern conflict with the International Crisis Group, the Post noted that “typically, when al-Qaeda leaders are killed, sympathizers announce their deaths online as a celebration of martyrdom.”  “If the victim was a lower-level member of the organization, groups may not announce their death, he said, but people close to them will, often saying how they were connected to the group,” the newspaper reported. “In this case, Drevon said ‘there was nothing.’","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vZmx1eC5jb21tdW5pdHkvamFrZS1qb2huc29uLzIwMjMvMDUvYW1lcmljYW4tZHJvbmUtdGVycm9yaXNtLWtpbGxzLWZhdGhlci1vZi10ZW4v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2022-06-05","Not Discerned","{""Tabatinga"", ""Amazonas"", ""Brazil""}","2023-05-20T03:09:50","Former Head of Brazil’s Indigenous Protection Agency Charged with Indirectly Contributing to Murders in the Amazon  The former head of Brazil’s Indigenous protection agency, Marcelo Xavier, has been charged with criminal acts of omission that indirectly led to the murders of Bruno Pereira and Dom Phillips in the Amazon last year. The federal police have accused Xavier of failing to take steps to protect Funai workers in the Amazon, which contributed to the crimes. Xavier was appointed by former far-right president Jair Bolsonaro in July 2019 and was removed from his position in December after Bolsonaro lost the presidential election to leftist rival Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.  The accusation against Xavier is based on the legal concept of dolus eventualis, which refers to a person being aware of the risk of a crime taking place but failing to act to prevent it. Another senior Funai official, Alcir Amaral, was indicted on the same charges. Pereira worked for Funai until he was removed from his post in late 2019, two weeks after he helped lead an operation targeting illegal miners in the remote Javari Valley region where he and Phillips were killed. At around the same time, one of Pereira’s Funai colleagues, Maxciel Pereira dos Santos, was shot dead in the city of Tabatinga. After that still unsolved assassination, Xavier was reportedly warned of the risk of further violence in the region but failed to act.  Pereira and Phillips were killed on 5 June 2022 after coming under attack while travelling down the Amazon after a four-day reporting trip looking at the situation facing Indigenous communities in the Javari region. Their bodies were found after a 10-day, Indigenous-led search. Xavier sparked fury in the days that followed the men’s disappearance, wrongly insinuating that Phillips and Pereira had entered an Indigenous territory without government permission. A judge later ruled that the two men never entered Indigenous lands, conducting interviews outside the borders of the Portugal-sized territory.  Neither Xavier nor Amaral made any immediate comment about the accusations. Writing on Twitter last August, Xavier claimed the murders were being manipulated by leftist opponents of Bolsonaro’s government. Prominent left-wing politicians and Indigenous activists welcomed reports of the charges against Xavier. The leftist lawmaker Guilherme Boulos denounced the former government’s “criminal omission”. “Under Bolsonaro’s command, Funai was warned of the risks Bruno Pereira and Dom Phillips were running and did nothing!” Boulos wrote.  Since Lula took office in January, Funai has undergone a radical shake-up. It is now run by the Indigenous activist and politician Joênia Wapichana, while a ministry for Indigenous peoples has also been created under the leadership of another prominent Indigenous politician, Sônia Guajajara. In an interview with The Guardian last year, the former Funai chief Sydney Possuelo said Bolsonaro’s anti-Indigenous actions meant “Indigenous people have never faced a worst moment in Brazilian history… because we are talking about a deliberate policy that comes from the president himself who gives cover to criminals and trespassers”. Possuelo accused Bolsonaro of turning Funai into an “anti-Indigenous agency”, adding: “In the Bolsonaro era, everything has become so dangerous because you have a pre-planned policy that stems from the presidency and spills out into every single other government institution.”  Three fishers are being held in high-security prisons while a judge prepares to rule on whether they will face trial by jury: two brothers called Amarildo and Oseney da Costa de Oliveira and a third man called Jefferson da Silva Lima. A fourth man, a shadowy figure suspected of running an illegal fishing network in the Javari Valley region, was named as the mastermind in January, although he has yet to be formally charged.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nbG9iYWx2aWxsYWdlc3BhY2UuY29tL3VrL2Zvcm1lci1oZWFkLW9mLWJyYXppbHMtaW5kaWdlbm91cy1hZ2VuY3ktY2hhcmdlZC1mb3ItYnJ1bm8tcGVyZWlyYS1hbmQtZG9tLXBoaWxsaXBzLW11cmRlcnMv0gGCAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbHZpbGxhZ2VzcGFjZS5jb20vdWsvZm9ybWVyLWhlYWQtb2YtYnJhemlscy1pbmRpZ2Vub3VzLWFnZW5jeS1jaGFyZ2VkLWZvci1icnVuby1wZXJlaXJhLWFuZC1kb20tcGhpbGxpcHMtbXVyZGVycy8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"assassination","1990-05-21","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T09:28:56","On May 21, 1990, at around 10:00 am, two visitors arrived at Mirwaiz Molvi Farooq’s residence in Nageen. Simultaneously, three young individuals, aged 18 to 25, claimed to have a scheduled appointment and gained entry after the initial visitors left. Molvi Farooq’s secretary, Syed Rahman Shamas, and another security guard, Mohammad Maqbool, were present in a separate room. The young individuals spent 15 to 20 minutes with Molvi Farooq before he was shot with a 7.65 pistol, sustaining severe injuries to his head, shoulders, and abdomen.  Due to the severity of his condition, Molvi Farooq was immediately transferred to SKIMS Hospital in Soura. Medical professionals performed surgery, but unfortunately, he succumbed to his gunshot wounds at 12:25 pm.  In a momentous news conference on Tuesday, May 16, 2023, the Jammu and Kashmir Police delivered a breakthrough in the long-standing case of Molvi Farooq’s assassination. After 32 years, the two elusive terrorists responsible for the murder were finally captured.  Since that fateful day on May 21, 1990, these terrorists had evaded capture by hiding in different countries like Nepal and Pakistan. But their days on the run came to an end when they returned to Kashmir a few years ago. The terrorists, identified as Zahoor Ahmad Bhat and Javaid Ahmad Bhat, known as Ajmal Khan and Bilal, were finally brought to justice. Out of the total five terrorists involved in this heinous act, Abdullah Bangroo and Rahman Shigan met their deserved fate earlier during encounters with security forces in the 1990s. The wheels of justice continue to turn, leaving no room for these terrorists to escape the consequences of their actions.  Throughout the years, a deliberate narrative perpetuated by Pakistan’s ISI, their paid secessionists, intellectuals, and self-proclaimed champions of civil liberties has sought to conceal the truth surrounding the killers of Mirwaiz Molvi Farooq. Instead of openly acknowledging that the murderers were terrorists, armed and financially supported by our neighbouring country Pakistan, they cunningly labelled them as “unknown gunmen.” This was a calculated deception aimed to manipulate the world and the people of Kashmir into believing that it was the Indian state responsible for Molvi Farooq’s murder, rather than the terrorists sponsored by Pakistan. The truth, however, remains resolute: Mirwaiz Molvi Farooq was ruthlessly murdered by terrorists aligned with pro-Pakistani terrorist groups like Hizbul Mujahideen and Hizbula. These terrorist organisations branded him as an Indian agent due to his participation in a purported political process aimed at achieving peace with the Indian government. Blinded by their warped ideology, the Pakistani-sponsored terrorists callously executed him, silencing a voice advocating for dialogue and reconciliation. It is imperative to recognise the malevolent forces at play, orchestrating acts of terror to fuel separatism and undermine peace in the region.  Pakistan’s reprehensible actions knew no bounds, as they even targeted the funeral procession of Molvi Farooq. Infiltrating a procession of 20,000 to 25,000 mourners from Soura, terrorists orchestrated a meticulously planned assault. As the funeral procession made its way towards Rajouri Kadal, it was intercepted by the CRPF forces near Islamia College in Hawal. What ensued was a nightmarish display of violence, carefully engineered by the terrorists. They instigated confusion and chaos, hurling stones at the CRPF personnel, while armed terrorists within the procession unleashed a hail of gunfire from AK-47 rifles, attacking the CRPF picket at Hawal. This horrific incident resulted in the loss of over 60 innocent civilian lives, with more than 200 individuals sustaining grave injuries due to the crossfire. The event, now known as the deadliest massacre in Kashmir, was a calculated scheme masterminded by Pakistan.  The truth, however, was twisted and distorted, as people were falsely led to believe that the Indian state was responsible for the assassination of Molvi Farooq and intentionally carried out a massacre during his funeral procession. The reality is far more sinister and implicates Pakistan in orchestrating this heinous act, aiming to instigate unrest and manipulate public sentiment. The consequences were dire, as a perpetual cycle of hate and warfare against India engulfed the Kashmiri region. Molvi Farooq’s assassination served as a catalyst, but it was only the beginning. Pakistani-backed terrorists orchestrated countless political and civilian killings, plunging the situation into deeper despair.  On April 1, 1993, Dr Abdul Ahad Guru, a pioneering Kashmiri cardiovascular and thoracic surgeon, fell victim to a merciless terrorist attack. And on June 19, 1994, Qazi Nissar, a revered religious scholar and educator, met a similar fate. These were just a few examples of the countless lives ruthlessly snuffed out by terrorists supported by Pakistan. Yet, the entire secessionist and pro-Pakistani ecosystem propagated a twisted narrative. The killers were not mere unknown gunmen, but ruthless terrorists. Yet, a web of deceit was cunningly woven to sow confusion and falsely paint India as the culprit. The aftermath of such deceitful narratives was nothing short of catastrophic. The youth, deceived by false information, took up arms and waged a misguided war against their own country. Grave after grave was dug, as innocent lives were sacrificed for a hollow and fabricated cause.  Three decades have passed, and justice continues to elude the victims of countless killings. Among them are the brutal murders of Kashmiri Pandits, including KL Ganju, his wife Serwanand Kaul Premi, Mahant Keshav Nath, Tika Lal Taploo, NK Ganju, Prem Nath Bhat, Ajay Kapoor, and many others. These innocent lives were tragically snuffed out by terrorists like the JKLF Chief Yasin Malik, yet their quest for justice remains unfulfilled.  In the face of overwhelming evidence, the truth was callously sacrificed, and a false narrative persisted. Blame was unjustly shifted onto former Governor Jagmohan for the exodus and killings of Kashmiri Pandits. However, the reality is starkly different.  The long-awaited arrest of the killers of Molvi Farooq after an agonising 32 years sends a resounding message: The Indian state possesses unwavering political will, superiority, and the necessary resources to apprehend the terrorists sponsored by Pakistan. This monumental achievement serves as a firm declaration from the authorities that Jammu and Kashmir will no longer be left vulnerable to the machinations of subversionists, terrorists, and fundamentalists.  The impact of such breakthroughs reverberates across the public sphere, leaving an indelible imprint on the collective consciousness. It has become undeniably clear that terrorists can no longer evade the consequences of their monstrous crimes. Moreover, those who have actively or passively participated in these acts of terror will not escape scrutiny.  The writer is a Srinagar-based Journalist and columnist.

"assassination","2023-05-17","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T14:20:14","May 17, 2023 By Michael Weymouth  As gun violence continues unabated in our country, it has become clear that the Republican Party has no intention of doing anything about it, short of offering thoughts and prayers to the victims’ families. That and a plethora of useless bromides such as “the only thing to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.”  The roots of the modern gun debate go back to the 1963, Kennedy assassination, when Democratic senator Thomas Dodd from Connecticut introduced legislation restricting the sale of mail order rifles. Shortly thereafter President Lyndon Johnson signed the Gun Control Act of 1968, and in 1994 President Bill Clinton signed the Assault Weapons Ban, which lasted ten years. It was allowed to expire under President George W. Bush. As a result, 20 million assault weapons are now in the hands of American gun owners.  It is clear that the Democratic Party has done its best to limit the sales of assault weapons, as well as to legislate common sense gun laws, while the Republican Party has done nothing but oppose them.  It hasn’t always been this way.  In fact, two of the icons of the Republican Party actually held opinions about gun control that were diametrically opposed to positions held by today’s Republican Party.  Chief Justice Warren Burger, a Nixon SCOTUS appointee said of the Second amendment, “The gun lobby’s interpretation of the Second Amendment is one of the greatest pieces of fraud, I repeat the word fraud, on the American people by special interest groups that I have ever seen in my lifetime. The real purpose of the Second Amendment was to ensure that state armies-the militia-would be maintained for the defense of the state. The very language of the Second Amendment refutes any argument that it was intended to guarantee every citizen an unfettered right to any kind of weapon he or she desires.”  One can hardly imagine that opinion coming from today’s Supreme Court, which has adhered to a much narrower interpretation of the Second Amendment. Compare the Court’s recent ruling that allowed New York citizens to openly carry guns, to comments made by President Ronald Reagan in 1967: “There is absolutely no reason why out on the street today a civilian should be carrying a loaded weapon.”  Burger’s and Reagan’s comments beg the question: what happened to the Republican Party?  The answer is the NRA and its 5 million members, most of whom vote solid Republican, and, as Burger pointed out, the gun industry’s lobby, which contributes millions of dollars to Republican politicians each year. The result is a constant Republican drumbeat that Democrats want to take away all guns. This is total hogwash.  In the meantime, American children fear going to school and their parents fear they will never see them again as their kids board the school bus in the morning.  Today’s Republican Party has a lot to answer for and hopefully they will wake up to the damage they have done by failing to deal with this important issue. A good start will be for every American voter to condition his or her vote on how committed a candidate is to revisiting the Second Amendment and how it might be amended to better serve and protect the American people.  There should be no greater motivation than the fact that there have already been 202 mass shootings in 2023, more than one a day.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhpbmdoYW1hbmNob3IuY29tL29waW5pb24tdGhlLXNlY29uZC1hbWVuZG1lbnQtZnJhdWQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

There was no immediate U.S. response to the allegations from Nikolai Patrushev, secretary of Russia's Security Council, which is chaired by Putin. Washington has previously denied involvement in at least one of the killings he mentioned.  Putin has accused the West of unleashing a proxy war aimed at toppling him and carving up Russia's vast natural resources following Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year, something Moscow calls ""a special military operation"".  A series of showcase attacks and mysterious assassinations inside Russia, far from the front lines in Ukraine, have raised concerns over domestic security, even more so after a drone attack on the Kremlin itself.  Darya Dugina, the daughter of a prominent Russian nationalist, was killed in a car bomb in August; pro-war blogger Vladlen Tatarsky, whose real name was Maxim Fomin, was killed in a bomb last month; and nationalist writer, Zakhar Prilepin, was wounded in a car bomb earlier this month.  Russia also accused Ukraine of attacking the Crimean Bridge last October and accused the West of being behind blasts on the Nord Stream gas pipelines in September.  Patrushev was cited by the state TASS news agency as saying all the attacks ""were planned and carried out with the coordination of the U.S. special services"".  ""The terrorist attacks committed in Russia are accompanied by an information campaign prepared in advance in Washington and London, designed to destabilise the socio-political situation, and to undermine the constitutional foundations and sovereignty of Russia,"" TASS quoted Patrushev as saying.  Story continues  The United States and its allies, who cast the invasion as an imperial-style land grab, say they want Ukraine to defeat Russia, the world's biggest nuclear power.  The State Department did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Patrushev's remarks.  U.S. intelligence agencies believe parts of the Ukrainian government authorised the attack that killed Dugina, the New York Times reported in October.  'RISK RISING'  Although President Joe Biden has warned that a direct military confrontation between the NATO military alliance and Russia would trigger World War Three, the Kremlin says the West is already fighting against Russia.  The United States and Britain have denied Russian claims they were involved in the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines. Ukraine has never claimed responsibility for the attack on the Crimean Bridge.  Washington said earlier this month it was a lie that the United States was behind the drone attack on the Kremlin.  As a former Soviet spy who has known Putin since the 1970s, Patrushev - who has accused the ""Anglo-Saxons"" of sabotaging Nord Stream in what he has called a terrorist attack - is seen by Western diplomats as having a major influence on the Russian leader.  Patrushev's pronouncements give an insight into thinking at the Kremlin's top levels, they say.  ""The risks of terrorist acts, including the use of unmanned aerial vehicles, at critical and potentially dangerous facilities have increased significantly,"" Patrushev said.  He said Ukrainian saboteurs within Russia were likely planning further attacks.

Though the piece seems to have been removed from the blog section of the website, it is still accessible through the digital library Internet Archive.  The article had listed Chicago-based blogger Jeffrey Camras, as the author, who is described in the bio as a person with a “deep love for the Jewish people and the state of Israel”.  “In order to right a wrong, in order to make peace and move forward, Palestine must be obliterated,” Camras wrote, adding, “It is an affront to society, morality, humanity. It represents lies and antisemitism, oppression and terror. Nothing more.”  He also wrote,  “No one cares about the Palestinians.

In his speech at the rally, Katz called for the assassination of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar.  “Yahya Sinwar should also know that if he dares to do so (meaning targeting the march), his fate will be the same as his friends in Islamic Jihad,” a reference to the assassinations carried out by Israel during its latest bombardment on Gaza.

According to transcripts obtained by and reported on The Mercury News, Becker allegedly admitted to fellow Councilmember Suds Jain that he leaked the grand jury report, titled ""Unsportsmanlike Conduct."" The report was highly critical of Becker and several other councilmembers, accusing them of voting in favor of the interests of the San Francisco 49ers who have had well-document tensions with the city over Levi's Stadium.  While Becker has maintained his innocence and pled not guilty to leaking the report per an article from The Mercury News earlier this month, testimony from campaign volunteer David Andre suggests Becker was, in fact the leaker and had also attempted to blame Mayor Lisa Gillmor for distributing the documents.

Several council colleagues, however, have defended him and are advocating for letting the legal process play out.  Meanwhile, questions remain around the extent of the 49ers' influence in the city. The team provided millions of dollars into Becker's mayoral race and other local elections, according to a San José Spotlight piece on the topic. Santa Clara Vice Mayor Kevin Park referred to the situation as a ""political assassination"" and called for an independent review and potential involvement from the state Attorney General.  The grand jury report, a 61-page document, accused five councilmembers, including Becker, of unethical ties to the 49ers and for putting the team's interests above those of the city. It was leaked to several media outlets in October 2022, before its official release. Falling in line with the alleged setup orchestrated by Becker, sources in the San José Spotlight's report claimed that Mayor Gillmor forwarded a copy of the confidential report to her private email account, which at the time raised questions about her involvement in the leak and the possibility that she shared the report with others. It is unclear whether the sources were in fact the framing now coming to light.  Moreover, the Santa Clara Police Officers' Association played a significant role in the events, as it had launched a website containing excerpts from the grand jury report and started a social media campaign against Becker. The association had spent tens of thousands of dollars to support Mayor Gillmor's re-election campaign.  In light of these developments, Councilmember Becker's case has taken on new dimensions, adding further twists to an already complex legal and political drama. While the outcome of the case remains uncertain, the impact on Santa Clara's politics is undeniable, as the city grapples with the powerful influence of the 49ers and the potential for further political turbulence.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vaG9vZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvc2FudGEtY2xhcmEtY291bmNpbG1hbi1hZG1pdHMtbGVha2luZy1hdHRlbXB0aW5nLXRvLWZyYW1lLW1heW9yL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"assassination","2019-07-05","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T10:40:04","Haiti is a failed state that continues its descent into violence, anarchy and humanitarian disaster. Bishop Dumas reflects on the UN's appeal to the international community to launch a multi-lateral mission to help the people respond to escalating gang violence.  By Jean-Charles Putzolu and Linda Bordoni  Widespread gang violence has plagued Haiti for nearly two years as rival gangs battle for control in the power vacuum created by the July 2021 assassination of President Jovenal Moise.  Prime Minister Ariel Henry’s attempts to chart a political transition for the poor Caribbean Island nation have failed and widespread gang violence impedes access to healthcare, has closed schools and worsened food insecurity. Haitians are taking the law into their own hands and a wave of vigilantism is heightening the country’s already sky-rocketing levels of violence.  The situation is such that the United Nations is pushing for an international force to be sent to Haiti to respond to the violence.  Haitian Bishop Pierre-André Dumas of Anse-à-Veau spoke to Vatican Radio about the critical situation and about how the Church is struggling to support and reassure the people.  As violence affects all sectors of society, Bishop Dumas said, “at the level of the local Church, at the level of my diocese, we try to be among the people and to reassure them that violence will not have the last word.”  “We also work to ensure that there are many places for listening, sharing and dialogue so that people may regain confidence,” he said.  Gang violence  Regarding the widespread levels of violence in certain neighbourhoods or lawless areas, the Bishop explained that even children and very young people are forced to join criminal street gangs. However, he added the population is starting to react.  “Gang members are becoming afraid and it is said that insecurity has changed sides,” he said, adding that it is crucial that chaos and anarchy be curbed.  “I believe that the police, as such, have a very important role to play, so that people are able to regain confidence and to show that the State exists and is organised,” the Bishop said.  Meanwhile, he added “On our part, our advocacy aims to help people to welcome the other as a brother, to make sure that fraternity is really lived. But above all, we must not take the law into our own hands.”  Asked how families can try and protect their children and prevent them from being recruited into street gangs, Bishop Dumas said it is necessary to start from the beginning.  A man carries his son as they search for cover amid gang violence in Port-au-Prince  The consequences of poverty  “We have reached this point because for a long time, we have seen children abandoned in the streets, children left to themselves, to their own devices, without a family,” he said that all too often “extreme poverty has pushed families to abandon their children.”  It is these children, he continued, who have been given weapons by politicians.  “These young people have taken up arms, they have grown up and they are moving away from these politicians, thinking that they can earn money on their own. So they kidnap and hold people for ransom, and to get paid they use a lot of violence. Sometimes they torture people,” he explained.  What is needed, he said, is to reinforce family values, create jobs for young people, and promote integral human development for the country.  A makeshift refugee camp set up by residents escaping gang violence in Port-au-Prince  Regarding the authorities’ lack of capacity to fight the street-gang phenomenon, Bishop Dumas said that Haiti has been in an extremely delicate political situation for a long time.  “There was no stability and the whole dynamic of the tourism sector broke down,” he said.  We are at a time, he added, that the Haitian people need accompaniment, not decisions that come from outside, but solutions that come from within.  “The people must assume responsibility, become protagonists of their own history and accept to pave the way for future generations. Every time a solution is imposed from elsewhere, it lasts a few years and then we end up back where we started,” he said.  “Every time a solution is imposed from elsewhere, it lasts a few years and then we end up back where we started.”  The right kind of support  This appears to be in contraposition to the UN proposal that an international intervention force be sent into Haiti. Bishop Dumas reiterated his opinion that Haiti must be “accompanied” with the right kind of support.  The UN Secretary-General, he noted, has been asking for this intervention for a long time, and the international community is aware that Haiti will not be able to find a solution alone.  “At the same time, not just any kind of intervention is possible. We really need to support, consolidate, professionalise and reform the police, and make them much more effective and efficient,” he said.  I believe, he added, that we have reached a point where we really have to take action: “It’s not for me to say yes or no to an international force, but I think we have the right to accompany the population in a concrete way, to help them find solutions and to ensure that nations agree to find a way out and help Haiti to get back on its feet, to stabilise, to take charge and, at the same time, to help the people regain the dignity it once had; a people who helped the world put an end to the atrocity of slavery.”  “Help the people regain their dignity.”  The desperation of Haitians displaced by gang violence","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhdGljYW5uZXdzLnZhL2VuL2NodXJjaC9uZXdzLzIwMjMtMDUvaGFpdGktYmlzaG9wLWR1bWFzLXZpb2xlbmNlLXVuLWludGVydmVudGlvbi1pbnRlcnZpZXctcG92ZXJ0eS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2023-05-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T14:01:23","When San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins announced that her office would not file charges against security guard Michael Earl-Wayne Anthony after he shot and killed Banko Brown at a Downtown Walgreens, part of her reasoning rested on the strength of Anthony’s potential self-defense case.  “In a self-defense case, the defendant would likely be able to use [Brown’s] past record,” said the District Attorney’s Office in an analysis of the case that led to the controversial decision not to charge Anthony. Usually, such evidence can be countered by similar evidence of violence in the defendant’s past, but that is not the case for Anthony, according to the analysis.  In Brown’s case, the DA’s report was alluding to criminal history that includes a 2019 guilty plea Brown entered for felony robbery after stealing from another Walgreens, on Mission Street, according to newly reviewed documents obtained by The Standard.  Brown had two prior second-degree robbery convictions, court records show. On Dec. 19, 2016, Brown—who was then 17 years old—was convicted as a juvenile and sentenced to state prison for that offense. It's unclear how many years Brown was sentenced to.  Then Brown was arrested on March 27, 2019, and charged again with second-degree robbery. He pleaded guilty in that second offense to stealing makeup from the Walgreens at 2690 Mission St.  Second-degree robbery is essentially shoplifting with physical contact, such as what occurred before Anthony shot Brown, say legal experts.  Brown was ordered to stay away from both the store and the security guard who witnessed the crime, Elias Omba Mulembo.  Brown was on probation until July 11, 2022, soon after which he was arrested twice: once for false imprisonment on Aug. 12, 2022, and once for domestic battery on Aug. 4 of the same year. Both cases were dismissed under Jenkins.  Despite the district attorney’s reliance on Brown’s prior convictions, several legal experts said that this history would likely have played little role in a prosecution against Anthony.  “I think those are details that favor the guard, but I don’t think they’re defining,” Tony Brass, a former San Francisco assistant district attorney, said of Brown’s past convictions.  Even if the guard had known of those convictions before the fatal shooting, it is unlikely that would have helped in his defense, Brass said.  A memorial is set up for 24-year-old Banko Brown outside of a Downtown San Francisco Walgreens where a vigil was held for him on May 1. Brown was shot and killed by an armed security guard at the 825 Market St. location of Walgreens on April 27. | Morgan Ellis/The Standard  Attorney John Burris, who is representing Brown’s family in a civil suit, agreed, saying that Brown’s past cases should have no bearing on why the DA did not pursue charges against Anthony.  “I don’t think those prior cases in and of themselves would justify using deadly force,” he said. “If you use that as a basis not to charge, that's a character assassination.”  The only reason past cases would be admissible is if Anthony had prior knowledge of those cases, Burris said.  Brown was shot and killed by Anthony on April 27 after trying to leave a Walgreens in Downtown San Francisco with several items he allegedly stole. Video shows Anthony stopped Brown and the two briefly fought before separating. Brown then left the store and turned to face Anthony, who shot him once. Anthony later told police he feared for his life because Brown had threatened to stab him.  No weapon was found on Brown, a Black trans man, whose death protesters say sends a message that LGBTQ+ people are not safe in San Francisco.  Anthony, who is also Black, had not brought his baton to work that day and does not own pepper spray or a taser, according to the interview he gave police after the shooting.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3Nmc3RhbmRhcmQuY29tL2NyaW1pbmFsLWp1c3RpY2UvYmFua28tYnJvd24ta2lsbGluZy13aGF0LXJvbGUtZGlkLWhpcy1wYXN0LXJ1bi1pbnMtd2l0aC13YWxncmVlbnMtc2VjdXJpdHktcGxheS1pbi1kYXMtZGVjaXNpb24tbm90LXRvLWNoYXJnZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

However, this is false: a voiceover in the clip, which shows images of both countries’ leaders, discusses the deteriorating relations between the neighbours. It also features an audio translation of an article by international media exploring whether Ethiopia and Eritrea could be drawn into a war in Sudan.  The post has been shared more than 150 times since it was published on May 11, 2023.  “War broke out between Eritrea and Ethiopia. Shabia left Humera. A Prosperity Party leader has been assassinated,” it says.  “This news item is for May 8, 2023. You can watch our full report on our Habesha Broadcast YouTube channel,” adds the post, which includes a 60-minute video.  Screenshot of the false post, taken on May 16, 2023  Shabia is an informal name for the Eritrean People’s Liberation Front (EPLF). The armed group fought for the independence of Eritrea from Ethiopia until the former broke away in 1991.  Humera is a town in Ethiopia’s Tigray region, which borders Eritrea and Sudan. The town was heavily affected by the recent war in northern Ethiopia.  Souring relations  Ethiopia and Eritrea renewed their relations (archived here) in 2018, ending decades of conflict over a border dispute.  Eritrea also fought alongside the Ethiopian army against the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) in a devastating two-year war that ended after the warring parties agreed to a peace deal (archived here) in November 2022.  However, international experts warn Eritrea could undermine the peace deal to push its own interests, while tensions have also been on the rise between its leader, Isaias Afwerki, and Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed (archived here).  However, the video doesn't contain any content showing clashes between Ethiopia and Eritrea in May 2023.  No footage  The video features a female narrator who discusses various issues related to Ethiopian politics.  In the first eight minutes, she introduces a post written by an Ethiopian activist called Girma Kassa and then proceeds to read it.  Story continues  Using a keyword search for “Girma Kassa” on Facebook, AFP Fact Check found the post was published on Facebook on May 8, 2023. The headline in Amharic translates to “News of a war in the Amhara region”.  It claims an armed conflict had broken out between local militia and government forces in Ethiopia’s northern Amhara region.  The voiceover continues, saying: “There has been fierce fighting between Amhara popular forces and forces loyal to Abiy and Berhanu Jula in North Shoa, Ataye and surrounding areas earlier today.”  The Ethiopian Human Rights Commission reported (archive here) on May 4, 2023 that clashes occurred between federal government forces and local armed groups in multiple places in the Amhara region.  Unrest had started in early April when the Ethiopian federal government decided to disband armed regional forces.  The Facebook video also features a news report which asks whether Ethiopia and Eritrea could be dragged into the war in Sudan, which broke out in April 2023.  A search for the keywords “The role of Ethiopia and Eritrea in the Sudanese war” led to an Al Jazeera article published on May 6, 2023 (archived here).  The narrator reads part of the article while also opining about the roles of Ethiopia and Eritrea in the Sudanese war.  The narrator then jumps to another news item about the alleged assassination of a member of the ruling Prosperity Party in Ethiopia’s Afar region. The party issued a statement on its official Facebook page on May 7, 2023 about the killing of a regional official by unidentified armed men (archived here).

The recent statements made by the Minister of the Environment, Miguel Ceara Hatton, regarding the “cleaning” of approximately 600 employees in the entity, do not align with the payroll records available until March, as the transparency portal does not provide the most up-to-date information.  In June 2022, the ministry had three payrolls (fixed, temporary, military), totaling 4,610 employees, with a total expenditure of RD$25,604,622. Less than a year later, in March 2023, under the leadership of a new minister, the number of employees decreased to 4,438, but the amount of money allocated for their payment increased to RD$31,379,334. Therefore, when comparing the numbers, the employee count decreased by 172 individuals from June to March, while the amount of money allocated for payments increased by RD$5,774,712.  Additionally, the Ministry of the Environment’s transparency portal showed two additional payrolls in March compared to June, labeled as “Substitute Personnel” and “Interim Personnel.” In response to the minister’s comments, journalist Guillermo Gómez refuted the claims made by Ceara Hatton, who mentioned the discovery of a journalist managing a payroll exceeding one million pesos upon his arrival. Gómez stated that the minister’s statements were completely false and clarified his own position.  Salvador Jorge Villegas, a deputy and the son of Jorge Mera took to Twitter to assert that his father’s name speaks for itself and continues to be defended by Dominican society, family, friends, and party members. He expressed gratitude for the support received and recalled his father’s advice on patience as the virtue of the courageous.  Furthermore, Carolina Mejía, the mayor of the National District and General Secretary of the PRM, described Ceara Hatton’s statements regarding the cancellation of alleged “ghost” employees who had remained in the entity since Jorge Mera’s tenure as unfortunate.

Sherman’s Field Order 15 was issued out of concern for a potential uprising of the thousands of ex-slaves who were following his army by the time it arrived in Savannah. 1 The field order stipulated that “The islands from Charleston south, the abandoned rice fields along the rivers for thirty miles back from the sea, and the country bordering the St. Johns River, Florida, are reserved and set apart for the settlement of the negroes now made free by the acts of war and the proclamation of the President of the United States. . . . Each family shall have a plot of not more than forty acres of tillable ground.” 2 This was followed by the formation of the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands in March 1865. In the months immediately following the issue of the field orders, approximately 40,000 former slaves settled in the area designated by Sherman on the basis of possessory title. 3 10,000 of these former slaves were settled on Edisto Island, South Carolina. 4 In 1866, following Lincoln’s assassination, President Andrew Johnson effectively rescinded Field Order 15 by ordering these lands be returned to their previous Confederate owners. Former slaves were given the option to work for their former masters as sharecroppers or be evicted. If evicted, former slaves could be arrested for homelessness under vagrancy clauses of the Black Codes. Those who refused to leave and refused to sign sharecrop contracts were threatened with arrest. Although restoration of the land to the previous Confederate owners was slowed in some cases by court challenges filed by ex-slaves, nearly all the land settled was returned by the 1870s. As Eric Foner writes, “Johnson had in effect abrogated the Confiscation Act and unilaterally amended the law creating the [Freedmen’s] Bureau. The idea of a Freedmen’s Bureau actively promoting black landownership had come to an abrupt end.” 5 The Freedmen’s Bureau agents became primary proponents of labor contracts inducting former slaves into the sharecropping system. 6 Among the lands that were repossessed in 1866 by former Confederate owners was the Maxcy Place plantation. “A group of freed people were at Maxcy Place in January 1866. . . . The people contracted to work for the proprietor, but no contract or list of names has been found.” 7 The one-acre piece of land at 8060 Maxie Road, Edisto Island, South Carolina, was part of the Maxcy Place plantation. This land was purchased at market value on August 6, 2018, by 8060 Maxie Road, Inc., a nonprofit company formed for the sole purpose of buying this land and recording a restrictive covenant on its use. This covenant has as its explicit purpose the restriction of all development and use of the property by the owner. The property is now appraised at $0. By rendering it legally unusable, this restrictive covenant eliminates the market value of the land. These restrictions run with the land, regardless of the owner. As such, they will last indefinitely. As reparation, this covenant asks how land might exist outside of the legal-economic regime of property that was instituted by slavery and colonization. Rather than redistributing the property, the restriction imposed on 8060 Maxie Road’s status as valuable and transactable real estate asserts antagonism to the regime of property as a means of reparation. 8060 Maxie Road is not for visitation. 1 Eric Foner, Reconstruction: America’s Unfinished Revolution, 1863–1877, updated ed.

Cameron Rowland, an acclaimed artist known for conceptual projects involving bureaucratic structures, ready-made objects, and more, has found an institutional home—for now, at least—for one of their biggest projects to date.  In its most basic form, the work, Depreciation (2018), constitutes an acre of land on Edisto Island, South Carolina, that is now being placed on extended loan to the Dia Art Foundation, which is known for its deep holdings of Minimalist and Conceptualist art. But like many other Rowland pieces, this one unfolds a complex history dealing with structural racism, land ownership, and power.  Edisto Island is one of the many South Carolina landmasses that were set aside for freed enslaved people on January 16, 1865 as part of a policy more familiarly known as “40 acres and a mule.” Contemporary historians have regarded the policy as an effort to stave off the possibility of a revolt by the formerly enslaved.  Some 10,000 subsequently people settled on Edisto Island, but their situation did not last long. In 1866, after Abraham Lincoln was assassinated, Andrew Johnson revoked the policy more formally known as Field Order 15, leaving the door open for Confederate owners to repossess their land, including the site of the Maxcy Plantation, which occupied Rowland’s one-acre spot and some of the surrounding area.  Rowland’s piece of land, 8060 Maxie Road, was purchased by a similarly titled nonprofit. It has now been placed under a restrictive covenant, which allows for the control of how the land is used. According to their description for the work, 8060 Maxie Road is now valued at $0, and the public cannot visit it.  The project is in keeping with past works by Rowland, who is currently the subject of a show at the MMK Frankfurt in Germany. For one particularly memorable show at New York’s Artists Space in 2016, for example, they sourced furniture produced by Corcraft, a company that relies upon the labor of inmates to produce its goods, and re-presented them at Artists Space, along with related documentation.  Often, Rowland’s work is not available for acquisition by institutions, bucking the traditional mode by which art enters museum collections. Instead, they make their pieces available on loan, typically with stipulations that are disclosed to the general public. Depreciation is listed as being on “extended loan” to the Dia Art Foundation.  Though the land itself is not viewable, Dia promised to exhibit framed documents related to Depreciation at its Chelsea gallery.  “Dia’s stewardship of Depreciation continues our founding mission of forging sustained collaborations with artists to ensure the legacy of their work that, physically or conceptually, is often beyond the scope and scale of the conventional museum or gallery model,” director Jessica Morgan said in a statement. “While many of the other works that make up our constellation of locations and sites engage the physical encounter between the viewer, the work, and their surroundings, Depreciation instead probes the idea of site in an entirely different manner.”  For many years, Dia’s galleries have been filled predominantly by works by white men—the Richard Serras and Michael Heizers of the world. Morgan has stated that one of her goals is to change that, a project of which the loan of Depreciation appears to be a part.  Rowland will have a 2024 solo show with new work at Dia:Beacon. It will be organized by Dia curator Jordan Carter, who said in a statement with Matilde Guidelli-Guidi that Depreciation “critically shifts Land art’s terms of engagement and proposes new urgencies, stakes, and possibilities within the institution and the field.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFydG5ld3MuY29tL2FydC1uZXdzL25ld3MvY2FtZXJvbi1yb3dsYW5kLWRpYS1hcnQtZm91bmRhdGlvbi1lZGlzdG8taXNsYW5kLWRlcHJlY2lhdGlvbi0xMjM0NjY5MTEzL9IBc2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFydG5ld3MuY29tL2FydC1uZXdzL25ld3MvY2FtZXJvbi1yb3dsYW5kLWRpYS1hcnQtZm91bmRhdGlvbi1lZGlzdG8taXNsYW5kLWRlcHJlY2lhdGlvbi0xMjM0NjY5MTEzL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

And despite the issues that impact Haitian immigrants living in the commonwealth and those in their home country, the community here is finding ways to celebrate Haitian Heritage Month.  Haitian American community groups are leading the way in celebrating their history, arts and culture with a monthslong lineup of events and activities. At Boston City Hall this week, Mayor Michelle Wu was joined by City Councilor At-Large Ruthzee Louijeune and other Haitian community leaders in the raising of the Haitian flag, a symbol of the country’s independence.  Social, economic and immigration issues have been weighing heavily on the Haitian community in recent years, from weather disasters to President Jovenel Moïse’s assassination in his home, and the number of immigrants encountering an overburdened system as they try to resettle in Massachusetts.  Joining Basic Black to discuss the region's growing Haitian community and Haitian Heritage Month are Marie St. Fleur, principal at St. Fleur Communications, and former state representative for the 5th Suffolk District, she was the first Haitian immigrant to hold public office in Massachusetts; the Rev. Dieufort J. Fleurissaint, president and executive director at True Alliance Center Inc., and chair for Haitian Americans United Inc.; and Alix Cantave, senior program officer-Haiti for the W.K.

"assassination","2023-02-01","Not Discerned","{""Home"", ""Washington"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T00:45:00","A federal judge ruled Friday that the Massachusetts Air National Guard member accused of leaking top-secret Pentagon documents online should remain jailed until his trial.  U.S. Magistrate Judge David Hennessy said Jack Teixeira had ""breached his obligation"" to protect U.S. national security information.  Jack Teixeira has his second pre-trial release hearing in a federal court in Worcester, Massachusetts.  During the first hearing a month ago, his attorneys argued that other people accused under the Espionage Act have received bail and assured the judge that Teixeira wouldn't try to leave the country.  However, prosecutors used Teixeira’s online messages to suggest he was a threat to others.  In one post, he said he would ""kill a lot of people"" to ""cull the weak.""  This comes on the heels of a Justice Department filing that said Teixeira had been warned about mishandling classified information months before his April arrest.  According to internal memos filed in court, prosecutors said that the 21-year-old had received instructions in September to stop observing and taking notes on classified intelligence information. Despite this warning, he was cautioned once more in October. In February, Teixeira was apprehended once again for accessing information that the memo stated was ""not related to his primary duty and was related to the intelligence field,"" the Associated Press reported.

The government's main strategy, is using Teixeira's former words against him successful in the first step of a trial the nation is closely watching.

"assassination","2023-05-14","Not Discerned","{""Manhattan"", ""Kansas"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T12:09:00","They nearly died! They made the whole thing up! The royal family was trying to Diana them! They’re incorrigible attention-seekers who exaggerated to try and get British taxpayers to pay for their security costs!  Public reaction to news that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and the duchess’s mother had been in a “near catastrophic” car chase with paparazzi in New York on Tuesday evening has been divided, to say the least. Some people seem to think that the severity of the incident has been inflated in an effort to drum up sympathetic PR for the Sussexes, at a time when they’re mired in several lawsuits about their privacy and security. Conservative commentator Megyn Kelly, for example, accused the pair of “exaggerating, because they like being in the public eye”.  Others, citing the obvious echoes of the paparazzi chase that killed Princess Diana in 1997, are horrified at how close the Sussexes came to death. Look on social media and you’ll also find wild conspiracy theories that a crafty King Charles engineered the whole thing and it wasn’t so much an accident as an assassination attempt.  The passionate and polarized response to Tuesday night’s incident is hardly surprising. Harry and Meghan have devoted fans and equally devoted haters; they can’t so much as eat a cheese sandwich without inspiring a string of unhinged reactions. Nevertheless, the range of responses to this particular event is remarkable: even the people directly involved seem to have very different recollections of what happened.  Let’s start with how the Sussexes characterized the chase. On Wednesday a spokesperson for Prince Harry said that the three passengers had been “involved in a near catastrophic car chase at the hands of a ring of highly aggressive paparazzi. This relentless pursuit, lasting over two hours, resulted in multiple near collisions involving other drivers on the road, pedestrians and two NYPD officers”.  Chris Sanchez, a member of Prince Harry’s security team has corroborated this description of events. “The public were in jeopardy at several points,” Sanchez told CNN. “It could have been fatal.”  The New York Police Department, meanwhile, characterized the incident as “challenging” rather than catastrophic. “The Duke and Duchess of Sussex arrived at their destination and there were no reported collisions, summonses, injuries or arrests in regard,” an NYPD spokesperson said.  New York City’s mayor, Eric Adams, while condemning the paparazzi as “reckless” and “irresponsible”, similarly characterized the incident as less dramatic than the Sussexes described and cast doubt on the supposed time-frame. “I would find it hard to believe that there was a two-hour high speed chase,” Adams said. A fair point since a two-hour high-speed chase in Manhattan is near impossible unless it’s 4am on a Sunday or Vin Diesel is behind the wheel. However, as Adams noted, even a 10-minute pursuit would be “extremely dangerous in New York City”.  Whatever happened, the real hero of the hour is Sukhcharn Singh, the yellow cab driver who was chauffeuring the threesome. Singh seems remarkably relaxed about his role in shuttling the Sussexes to safety. (Bear in mind that it probably takes a lot to faze a New York cab driver.) Singh told CNN that he didn’t feel under threat by the encounter with photographers but Harry and Meghan looked “nervous and scared”. He also told the Washington Post that the incident lasted 10 minutes. “I don’t think I would call it a chase,” Singh said. “I never felt like I was in danger. It wasn’t like a car chase in a movie.” Still, added Singh, he could understand why his famous passengers were terrified. “You know, my feelings were normal, but I’m sure their feelings were more intense because of what his mom, Princess Diana, died in a crash running away from the paparazzi,” he said. “So I think their emotions must have been higher.”  And that’s really the crux of it, isn’t it? We all react to high-pressure situations in different ways, based on our personal histories. It is perfectly natural that Prince Harry would be traumatized by being aggressively pursued by the paparazzi. Nobody has any right to dismiss or diminish his response to what must have been a very triggering situation. You don’t have to particularly like Harry and Meghan to be disturbed by the constant vitriol directed against them, particularly from the British media. And you don’t have to be a Harry and Meghan cheerleader to feel disturbed at how they were treated by the royal family. Who, by the way, have kept conspicuously quiet on the car chase.  Anyway, if there’s a happy ending to come out of all of this I hope it’s that Singh gets a cameo in the next Fast and the Furious movie.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9jb21tZW50aXNmcmVlLzIwMjMvbWF5LzE5L2RpZC1oYXJyeS1hbmQtbWVnaGFuLWV4YWdnZXJhdGUtdGhlaXItY2F0YXN0cm9waGljLWNoYXNlLWl0cy1jb21wbGljYXRlZNIBfmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9jb21tZW50aXNmcmVlLzIwMjMvbWF5LzE5L2RpZC1oYXJyeS1hbmQtbWVnaGFuLWV4YWdnZXJhdGUtdGhlaXItY2F0YXN0cm9waGljLWNoYXNlLWl0cy1jb21wbGljYXRlZA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2019-07-25","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T16:30:36","House Republicans have launched a probe into the soaring number of terrorism suspects who’ve been detected trying to sneak into the U.S. under President Biden, calling it a “clear national security risk” and demanding Homeland Security cough up its plan for stopping the surge.  House Oversight and Accountability Committee Chairman James Comer is leading the effort, joined by Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan and Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mark Green.  They pointed to the 96 people on the terrorism watchlist who’ve been caught at the southern border over the past seven months — by far a record pace — and said if that many are being detected, it begs the question of how many more are getting through.  “There is a growing risk that dangerous aliens with terrorist ties are making it across the border into the United States. This is a clear national security risk. We need to know that the Department of Homeland Security is making every effort to handle the risks presented by gotaways with potential terrorist ties,” Mr. Comer, Kentucky Republican, said.  The administration, in previous communications to Congress, has assured lawmakers that those caught at the border with terrorism-related records are “detained and removed.” But Mr. Comer and the other chairmen pointed to CBP’s website, which says they “may” be detained and removed “to the extent possible” under law and policy.  The lawmakers on Friday asked Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to explain what that means and to reveal any blockades on detaining terrorism suspects.  DOCUMENT: Letter to DHS  They also pointed to the 1.5 million illegal immigrants known to have entered and evaded capture — the so-called “gotaways.”  “We fear these known gotaways could also include illegal aliens with terrorist ties,” the chairmen wrote to Mr. Mayorkas.  Homeland Security said in a statement that it would answer the letter “via official channels, and the Department will continue to respond appropriately to Congressional oversight.”  The 96 people were caught by Border Patrol agents as they came across the U.S.-Mexico boundary. Their identities triggered hits in the government’s terrorism screening database, or TSDB, which is commonly referred to as the terrorism watchlist. The watchlist includes known and suspected terrorists and people believed to be associates of those individuals.  Homeland Security said terrorism designations are a snapshot in time and suggested some of those listed on the watchlist were placed there as part of organizations the U.S. no longer feels a threat.  Seven months into the fiscal year, agents have already nearly matched the full total for 2022 — which itself shattered previous records.  Sixteen terrorism suspects were apprehended in April alone. By contrast, the entire four years of the Trump administration saw just 11 apprehensions total.  The chairmen asked Mr. Mayorkas to turn over the immigration files and detention history of all illegal immigrants caught at the southwest border who were flagged by the TSDB during the Biden administration.  They also asked for Homeland Security’s estimates of terrorism suspects within the population of gotaways.  Claims of terrorists sneaking over the border came into stark view last year when the FBI accused an Iraqi man of trying to orchestrate an assassination plot against former President George W. Bush, using an Islamic State hit squad he planned to sneak in over the southern border.  The FBI said Shihab Shihab ran a smuggling operation, and in a conversation with an FBI informant claimed he had already smuggled two Hezbollah operatives in, charging them $50,000 apiece.  Shihab, who came to the U.S. in 2020 on a visitor’s visa and then filed an asylum claim, pleaded guilty last month to attempting to provide material support to terrorists for his role in the assassination plot. He is awaiting sentencing.  The terrorism numbers are striking not only in their volume but also in what they say about the immigration debate.  Two years ago, when GOP leaders visited the border during the early days of the Biden surge, they revealed they’d been told by agents of terrorism suspects being caught. Democrats accused them of lying, and fact-checkers swung into action to question their account.  Last year, however, Customs and Border Protection began to publish the numbers online every month. And the GOP claims were fully born out.  Pieces from CNN and PolitiFact purporting to fact-check the GOP claims remain online, uncorrected, as of this writing, even though the public data has been available for a year.  • Stephen Dinan can be reached at sdinan@washingtontimes.com.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b250aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzL21heS8xOS9jb21lci1zYXlzLXJpc2luZy1udW1iZXItb2YtdGVycm9yaXNtLXN1c3BlY3RzLWF0LS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

In a rare coincidence, it took place 4 years later to the day of when Kirchner announced Alberto Fernández as the Frente de Todos coalition candidate for the 2019 elections.  In the main studio, she sat across from Pablo Duggan, the TV anchor in charge of conducting the interview for his show, Hard to tame (Duro de domar, in Spanish), and talked about a variety of subjects: the economic situation and the agreement with the IMF, the failed assassination attempt against her, as well as the upcoming elections and the chances of the Frente de Todos (FdT) coalition.  Expectations were high in the days and hours leading up to the interview. Last Friday, Cristina Kirchner published a letter on her website saying she would not be running for president, or any other office. Kirchner had accused the judiciary and the Supreme Court of imposing a “political ban” not only against her but the Peronist party as a whole.  Kirchner reiterated that she will not run for any elected office in the upcoming elections. “What I published the other day is very clear,” she said, despite repeated requests from her followers for her to reconsider.  Even though she acknowledged that the love and affection between them is strong, Kirchner never wavered in her commitment, and said she hoped “the children of the decimated generation will be the ones to follow,” in reference to the descendants of the political activists and militants that were persecuted and disappeared by the 1976-1983 dictatorship.  Here are some of the most important definitions she gave on economy, elections, and the Judiciary in the interview, which went on for almost an hour and a half:  “In a dual-currency economy, the debt in dollars worsens the balance of payments constraint.”  “[The Macri government’s agreement with the IMF] was outrageous.”  “The agreement with the IMF will need to be reviewed.”  “We need to discuss how to get out of the dual-currency economy with all the political parties that have parliamentary representation.”  “If we want to win the elections, we have to get society to fall in love with us again.”  “The Frente de Todos government was better than what an eventual second term of Macri would have been.”  “Being able to eat four times a day is neither ideological nor populist.”  “The 2023 elections are going to revolve around an electorate separated in three parts,” in reference to the Frente de Todos coalition, the Juntos por el Cambio coalition, and the La Libertad Avanza party.  “One third of the electorate is voting out of anger,” referring to the popularity of right-wing candidate Javier Milei.  “In these elections I will play the role I have always played, as a political activist, in order to help bring about what I think will be the best for the Argentine people.”  “My daughter needs me, and if something were to happen to me, she would suffer greatly.” Her daughter Florencia Kirchner has had repeated health problems. She was hospitalized in Cuba between 2019 and 2020, and Kirchner visited her on several occasions. The Argentine media has published intimate information about Florencia and even went as far as directly blaming CFK for her daughter’s health problems. This generated a condemnation by journalists’ associations.  “Luckily, I didn’t see when the gunmen pulled the trigger. The [failed assassination attempt] shocked and changed me. I never thought something like that could ever happen again in Argentina.”  “The Supreme Court is a device of persecution.”  “[The Judiciary] is coming for the democratic system.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vYnVlbm9zYWlyZXNoZXJhbGQuY29tL3BvbGl0aWNzL25hdGlvbmFsLXBvbGl0aWNzL2NyaXN0aW5hLWtpcmNobmVycy1maXJzdC1pbnRlcnZpZXctaW4tc2l4LXllYXJzLWhlci1tYWluLWRlZmluaXRpb25z0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

It was the first time the former PEN president was seen in public since he was severely wounded by a knife attack in August 2022. At 75 years old, the “Satanic Verses” author has survived numerous death threats and assassination attempts throughout the years in response to his literature.  Rushdie took the stage at the event held at the American Museum of Natural History in New York in front of 700 guests. He wore a pair of glasses with the right lens tinted black to protect his right eye, which was blinded in the knife attack. He began his speech with a lighthearted flare.  More from Variety  “It’s also kind of terrifying to come on stage after Lorne Michaels, John Mulaney and Colin Jost. It would be a foolish person who tried to tell a joke,” he said, noting Michaels, who was among the night’s main honorees.  “I wanted to say, ‘Hi, everybody.’ It’s nice to be back, as opposed to not being back, which was also an option. But I’m pretty glad the dice rolled this way.”  Amidst cheers and applause from the crowd, Rushdie recognized PEN and the power and importance of the organization.  “The attack on books, the attack on teaching, the attack on libraries in, how can I put this—Florida—has never been more dangerous, never been more important to fight,” he said. Rushdie spoke about the recent lawsuit that Penguin Random House and PEN America have brought against a Florida School Districts.  Rushdie then addressed the 2022 attack, saying, “I’m being awarded a courage award, but the true courage was not shown by me.”  “After I was attacked, the first person who ran to defend me was Henry Reese,” he said. “Henry, a man in his seventies, ran at my assailant, who is 24 years old with a knife.” He went on to acknowledge the rest of the people that came to his rescue that day.  Story continues  “The courage that day, was all theirs. I never knew their names, I never saw their faces, but that large group of people, I owe my life to.”  Rushdie ended his speech with a message: “Terrorism must not terrorize us. Violence must not deter us. As the old Marxists used to say, ‘The struggle goes on.’”  Suzanne Nossel, PEN America’s CEO, said about Rushdie, “To see him back, in action, at this event, with his PEN America family is a remarkable testament to his resilience and strength and a kind of emblem of our work—that in the face of lethal threats, the writer triumphs and the voice continues.”  NEW YORK, NEW YORK – MAY 18: Colin Jost hosts the 2023 PEN America Literary Gala at American Museum of Natural History on May 18, 2023 in New York City.

Subscribe to the Reckon Daily for stories centering marginalized communities and speaking to the under-covered issues of the moment.  A hush came over Mt. Neboh Baptist Church in Harlem as a choir sang a four-part harmony during their rendition of “People Get Ready,” a song composed in 1965, the year following the March on Washington and President John F. Kennedy’s assassination.  In front of the singers was a congregation mourning the loss of Jordan Neely, a 30-year-old man who died on May 1, after Daniel Penny, an ex-Marine, placed him in a chokehold on a Manhattan subway train.  Following his death, demonstrators took to the streets in protest, with some jumping onto subway tracks and shutting down intersections, resulting in the arrests of multiple people.  Penny, 24, has since been charged with second-degree manslaughter. His attorneys have previously said that their client didn’t intend to harm Neely and “could not have foreseen his untimely death.”  Hundreds of people came to the church Friday to pay their respects and express their condolences.  Attendees included Dr. Rev. Al Sharpton, who delivered Neely’s eulogy, U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado and Yusef Salaam, one of the Central Park Five, a group of teenaged boys wrongfully convicted of raping a woman in 1989.  Sr. Pastor Johnnie M. Green, Jr. conducted the ceremony. He previously led the funeral service for Neely’s mother, Christine Neely, after she was killed in 2007.  During his address, Sharpton vowed to continue fighting for people struggling with homelessness and mental health difficulties.  Until change happens, Sharpton said, “There will be no justice, there will be no peace,” leading the crowd to erupt into chants of “No justice! No peace!”  Sharpton took issue with Penny being described as a good samaritan by some, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who encouraged his Twitter followers to donate to Penny’s legal defense fund last week. The fund has garnered over $2.6 million in donations.  “A good samaritan helps those in trouble,” Sharpton said. “They don’t choke them out.”  The reverend also criticized officials for releasing Penny from custody the night of Neely’s death, after officials questioned him about the incident.  Neely spent most of his late teens and early 20s imitating Michael Jackson to the amusement of tourists and subway commuters, before a lack of housing and mental health issues took over his life.  Mildred Mahazu, his great-aunt, spoke during Friday’s ceremony, but her comments were brief.

"assassination","2023-10-16","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T16:56:25","In 1954, after years of successfully smearing innocent people, ruining lives and careers, Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy launched a new attack against an unlikely target – the United States Army. Unlike his other victims, the Army had the power and influence to fight back.  McCarthy accused the Army of having weak security at one of its top-secret facilities. In response, the Army hired a well-known lawyer, Joseph Welch, to defend the country’s oldest service branch against the allegations. During a public hearing at which Welch testified, McCarthy accused one of Welch’s junior attorneys of having ties to the Communist Party with no evidence to back up his charge.  Welch responded with words that have gone down in history as the ultimate put down for bullies like McCarthy. “Until this moment, senator, I think I never really gauged your cruelty or your recklessness.”  McCarthy tried to fight back, but Welch stopped him. “Let us not assassinate this lad further, senator. You have done enough. Have you no decency?”  Have you no decency?  With those four immortal words McCarthy’s popularity in the country disappeared overnight, he was censured by his fellow senators, rebuffed by the media that helped create him, and died three years later in disgrace. His brand of character assassination has now become known as McCarthyism.  Now, in the beautiful North Idaho community of Coeur d’Alene, Welch’s indictment “have you no decency” applies to Brent Regan, the chair of the Kootenai County Republican Central Committee. After years of smearing his political opponents, Regan hit a new low in the recent local non-partisan library board election.  Two incumbents, Judy Meyer, and Regina McCrea were running for re-election. I don’t know McCrea, but I have worked with Judy Meyer for a decade as chair of Idaho Business for Education’s Panhandle region.  Judy is an institution and community treasure in Coeur d’Alene. She has served on the North Idaho College board of trustees, served as president of the State Board of Education, still serves on the board of Idaho Public Television, has donated millions of dollars to make her community a better place to live, and has served on the library board for 30 years.  At the age of 81, when most people retire from public service, Judy ran for re-election to the library board because she is concerned about those who want to ban books in the library. She wanted to prevent Regan and his book-banning minions from taking over the library board just as they took over the North Idaho College board and drove it to the brink of oblivion.  On Tuesday, Judy lost her race for re-election to the board after Regan’s Kootenai County GOP committee sent out a letter accusing Judy and McCrea of allowing “graphic books with text and pictures describing every imaginable sex act to be purchased and displayed to children.”  The letter went on to say, “These books are so explicit that if you were to give them to a child, you would be committing a crime.”  Regan’s group also paid for a video in which they accused the library board of failing to protect children from “harmful media and reading material.”  In the video, a young girl comes home from school and tells her mother, who is washing dishes, that at the library a woman read a book to the children. The girl tells her mother that the book had “moms and dads and there were kids” and they were “doing things like kissing each other and some of ‘em didn’t have any clothes on.”  The video goes on to show the shocked mother turning to her daughter.  “Mommy,” the child asks. “What’s anal sex?”  At that, the shocked mother drops a plate, and it shatters on the floor.  The video ends by urging people to vote for the candidates running against Judy and McCrea.  Let’s be clear, Judy Meyer is no groomer. Judy Meyer would never allow children to be exposed to sexually explicit books. She is a mother and a grandmother and a pillar of decency and virtue. She has dedicated her life to serving her community. She and her husband of more than 57 years were just honored in the Spokane business newspaper as “icons” of the Coeur d’Alene community.  This time Regan and his minions jumped the shark. To paraphrase Joseph Welch’s immortal words, his cruelty and recklessness hit a new low. He has demonstrated in a most public way that he, indeed, has no decency.  Coeur d’Alene is one of the most beautiful towns in the United States, nestled along the banks of Lake Coeur d’Alene. It is populated by many good people who love their community. It has known good times and bad times like when it had to fight and defeat a group of neo-Nazis that plagued the area. Thousands of outsiders have flocked to the community because of its lakeside beauty and thriving economy.  But in the last few years a heavy darkness has descended over Coeur d’Alene, thanks largely to people like Brent Regan. They have infected the community with a poison that has spread like wildfire. Coeur d’Alene is now a place where truth, love, respect, civility, and goodwill go to die.  Coeur d’Alene is at risk of losing its wonderful community college, the oldest in Idaho, because Brent Regan backed far-right candidates who took over the board of trustees. It has already lost many good public servants who, like Judy Meyer, were smeared. Now it is about to lose its community library to book censorship. One has the haunting feeling that the recent library election is proof positive that the community is close to losing its soul.  One wonders when a majority of people in that blessed lakeside community will collectively tell Brent Regan and his minions that enough is enough. One wonders when they will tell Brent Regan and his minions that their cruelty knows no bounds. One wonders when they will tell Brent Regan in no uncertain terms that he has no decency. That his brand of character assassination has no place in their community.  The scary truth is, if they can character assassinate a community icon and an 81-year-old grandmother like Judy Meyer, no one’s reputation is safe. They can tarnish anyone, no matter how innocent they are.  When the good citizens of Coeur d’Alene finally decide to send Brent Regan and his acolytes packing, then, and only then, can they start rebuilding their town into the beautiful, welcoming, and loving community that once was the jewel of North Idaho.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlkYWhvZWRuZXdzLm9yZy92b2ljZXMvaGF2ZS15b3Utbm8tZGVjZW5jeS1hcHBsaWVzLXRvLWJyZW50LXJlZ2FuL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The attack occurred late Wednesday in the community of Source Matelas, north of the capital of Port-au-Prince, police said.  “This criminal act is beyond reprehensible and will not go unpunished,” Haiti’s National Police said in a statement Thursday, adding that officers will not be intimidated.  A video circulating on social media showed the policeman’s body while alleged gang members mention the name Izo, leader of the “5 Seconds” gang, as one of them posed with the victim.  Also Wednesday, unidentified assailants opened fire on a car carrying anti-corruption judge Jean Wilner Morin, who survived the attack. Haiti's Communications Ministry said Friday that the attack occurred in the upscale suburb of Petionville. The agency describing it as “heinous and criminal"" and noted that it would not stop Morin from carrying out his duties.  Gangs are estimated to control up to 80% of the capital and have seized control of communities north of Port-au-Prince that previously were considered safe as they continue to grow more powerful since the July 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse.  More than 21 police officers were killed in the first three months of the year, according to the U.N. That number has risen, with another three killed in early April as the U.N. chief and others press for the immediate deployment of an international armed force that Haiti's prime minister requested in October to quell gang violence. But no one has shown any interest in leading such a force.  Haiti’s National Police is severely understaffed and under resourced, with some 13,200 active-duty officers serving a country of more than 11 million people. The international community has provided police training and equipment including armored vehicles paid for by Haiti's government, but several of these have been seized by heavily armed gangs.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vSW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC93aXJlU3Rvcnkvb2ZmaWNpYWwtc3VzcGVjdGVkLWdhbmctbWVtYmVycy1raWxsLWhhaXRpYW4tcG9saWNlbWFuLWFtaWQtOTk0NTU1OTLSAXdodHRwczovL2FiY25ld3MuZ28uY29tL2FtcC9JbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsL3dpcmVTdG9yeS9vZmZpY2lhbC1zdXNwZWN0ZWQtZ2FuZy1tZW1iZXJzLWtpbGwtaGFpdGlhbi1wb2xpY2VtYW4tYW1pZC05OTQ1NTU5Mg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

She is trying to get the book removed from Orange County's high school libraries.  ""This one was brought to me by a parent at a different county in Florida, so I looked on Orange County Public Schools website to see if it was in Orange County Public Schools, and it was - in five high schools here,"" she said.  Assassination Classroom tells the story of a smiling space alien with tentacles who destroys part of the moon, then starts working as a schoolteacher. The alien is nearly immune to Earth weapons but challenges the students to try killing him while at the same time becoming a beloved educator to the group of misfit students.  Huntley's own children don't go to public schools but says she's concerned about what message the book gives the ones who do.  ""I thought to myself first of all, we're very concerned about school safety. At the same time, we're also concerned about we need to recruit more teachers and retain them. And a message like this in the book is not helping that situation,"" she said.  The Orange County Public Schools website shows the district is currently reviewing the request to pull the book from shelves. Officials said there was no timeline for this process. Danny Morales, with comic book store The Collective, said the book was meant to be a satire.  ""Over the course of time, they actually start to love him, because their grades get better, their prospects in life get better, so it actually does have some real learning, it's not just like a deadly class type of thing,"" he said.  A parent in Osceola County was also trying to get the book removed from school libraries there.  FOX35 contacted publisher VIZ Media for their take on the situation, we haven't heard anything back, yet. Morales said high schoolers who took time to read the book may be able to see the story in its intended context.  ""It's set up for teens, it gives it the teen rating.

"assassination","2023-04-19","Not Discerned","{""Tijuana"", ""BajaCalifornia"", ""Mexico""}","2023-05-19T10:39:16","SAN DIEGO (Border Report) — Through the first four months of the year, 603 homicides were recorded in Tijuana, including 161 in April alone, according to Baja California’s State Attorney General’s Office.  Of the people killed this year, 68 have been women.  Carlos Jaramillo Silva, president of Tijuana’s Business Council, says the high murder rate continues to generate a bad image for the city.  “This draws a lot of attention, it’s a crisis even though there’s a lot of work going on to lower the homicide rate,” he told the El Sol Newspaper in Tijuana.  Jaramillo is calling for a new strategy when it comes to fighting crime on the streets.  “We need to know what every police agency is doing, we can’t have all of them essentially doing the same thing,” he said.  He also said the high murder rate has yet to have a “big negative impact on attracting new business and investments to the city,” adding that he is concerned with the growing problem of extortion, when businesses are forced to pay cartels a tariff to stay in operation.  Tijuans had more than 2,000 homicides in 2022. According to figures published by the state prosecutor’s office, the city recorded 2,014 homicides in 2020. In 2019, a little more than 2,200 homicides were recorded in Tijuana, well short of the 2,499 in 2018.

"assassination","2023-05-16","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T00:42:00","John Yang: Well, we`re going to be hearing a lot more from Donald Trump in the days to come. The field vying to challenge him in the Republican presidential nomination race is growing. Today, South Carolina Senator Tim Scott filed the necessary paperwork with the Federal Election Commission, and he says he`ll make what he calls a major announcement Monday in Charleston. And on Wednesday, Florida governor Ron DeSantis is suspected to say that he`s running.  In recent days, DeSantis and the current frontrunner, former President Donald Trump, have been exchanging increasingly pointed barbs. Trump mocked the governor after two DeSantis-backed candidates ended up losing in Tuesday`s elections. And on the other hand, The New York Times reported that DeSantis has privately told supporters that Trump can`t win in 2024.  Carl, what`s this race going to look like? Are they going -- these are two politicians whose careers have really been intertwined. They`re sort of playing in the same lane, going after the same voters.  Carl Hulse: And Trump would say he made Ron DeSantis his endorsement in the Florida governor`s race. It`s just going to be a very messy battle.  I think DeSantis might be happy that other people are jumping into this race, and it sort of might dilute a little bit of the Trump effect on him. I do think that`s interesting that other people have seen what`s happened, have seen how it`s gone with DeSantis, and still say, you know what, I`m willing to jump in there and take on the former president. I do think it`s just going to be a free for all, though.  And Donald Trump is really great at character assassination, and he`s going to apply those skills to Ron DeSantis.  John Yang: Could what DeSantis is doing, could it work, going after the same voters, sort of trying to be trying to be Trumpism without Trump?  Carl Hulse: Yes, I think that`s his message, right, Trump can`t win. I do think there`s a lot of Republicans in the Senate who also believe that and are worried about Trump.  I do think, though, that you`re going to see Trump use this feud that DeSantis has had with Disney against him and say, this guy is not good for business and try to scare away donors.  Fin Gomez: Sorry. Yes. DeSantis hasn`t even launched his campaign yet. As you said, it`s expected next week. And he`s lost momentum, though. He`s lost momentum over the last several weeks, over the last several months, in part because he has not engaged with Donald Trump. And some of his supporters have said, like jump in already, like counter, right?  So, I think that once that happens, I think after next week, I`ve been told by some folks in DeSantis world that that will increase, that he will get more vocal towards the former president, but it will turn this cycle, I believe, into a vicious one. It will be a brutal, brass knuckle cycle, and worse perhaps than we`ve seen since 2016.  John Yang: How will -- you say DeSantis is going to get more active. But what contrast will he try to draw with President Trump?  Fin Gomez: Well, frankly, he has been leaning into this card of being the best person to embody the Trump-era policies for the Republican base without having the Trump baggage. I think you`re going to see more of that. He`s been tweaking him, as we`ve seen. He`s been increasing it, increasing his criticisms.  But at the same time, because of that lack of momentum, as Carl touched upon, we have been seeing more potential contenders, say, even this past week, from the mayor of Miami to the North Dakota governor, to others saying they are considering seriously considering runs and jumping into the presidential freight. And a lot of that is because DeSantis has lost momentum over the last few weeks.  John Yang: So, that`s their hope there. That`s what fuels these sort of long shot candidacies, that`s how they think they could win?  Fin Gomez: Yes, that and in part because they`re still, despite of his positioning of Trump`s positioning as this frontrunner. And I think most national polls, there`s an average national polls, that show that he`s up by 30 points over DeSantis right now. But because there are still these looming investigations with Jack Smith and the others, Fulton County, that perhaps that this trajectory is not sustainable. And so the more they enter into the race, they feel they could they could change, it could evolve and they could get a chance. And, frankly, I think a lot of them are relying on that. We`ll see what happens.  John Yang: Turning to the Democratic side, Kayla, Vice President Kamala Harris` profile seems to be rising in recent days. Is there some strategy behind that?  Kayla Tausche: Well, in short, yes, John, because her profile had receded to behind the scenes. Her aides had complained that the issues with which she was tasked were low-profile issues and she was set up to fail essentially because they were issues that were not designed to succeed. Now, in recent weeks, she`s taken the helm of the administration`s messaging on abortion rights.  And in recent weeks, she`s also taken the lead on some debt ceiling strategy as well. She was in the meeting with congressional negotiators this week after not being in the meeting last week. She held a briefing for reporters yesterday talking about the consequences of default. And then even today, while she was visiting a philanthropic facility in California, she made comments that made news about the debt ceiling suggesting that giving some of the reasons behind the pause.  And so the White House has seemed to make a concerted effort to put her out there. And it`s because the attacks from the other side are expected to discuss President Biden`s age and the fact that Kamala Harris, the vice president, is just a heartbeat away from the presidency. And so her record is expected to come under attack just alongside the presidents. And they want that to be unassailable and they want her to be shown being in the lead, hand in glove with President Biden on a lot of these issues.  John Yang: The Republicans could be saying she could be president sooner rather than later, given the president`s age?  Kayla Tausche: Yes. I mean, that`s what they`re anticipating the message to be because of the attacks on President Biden`s age. And so they`re gearing up for that. And even just her appearances in President Biden`s ads and some of his high-profile events so far, it`s very clear that they`re raising her profile to show that she would be an able leader if anything were to happen to President Biden to try to nip those attacks in the bud even before they start.  John Yang: Seung Min, the campaign also released a strategy memo, and, interestingly, listed the states where they thought they can be competitive in 2024. Anything in that memo surprise you?  Seung Min Kim: It was really interesting how they specifically singled out North Carolina and Florida as two states where they will try to be active and play in as compared to the states, the swing states that they laid out that were so successful then back in 2020. Because if you look at the states, a lot of them are very familiar to us, such as Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Georgia and Arizona clearly were pivotal states for the President in 2020 and also, frankly, in 2022 as well, in the midterms.  But North Carolina and Florida caught my eye. Florida, for us, when I started covering politics, Florida was a solid swing state. Now, it is clearly a red state considering, especially looking at Governor DeSantis` resounding re-election victory last November. But it is someplace where they see at least it`s worth investing money.  And in North Carolina is really interesting as well. It is a state where the demographics could be pretty ripe for Democrats to take that state again after losing it to Republicans the last couple of presidential cycles. And I do think that`s another state where abortion, which has been such a key issue in the midterms, we just saw the Republican-led legislature override Governor Cooper`s veto of, I believe, a 12-week abortion ban. And that issue is going to be really salient, really relevant for so many states, including so many swing states to come.  John Yang: Seung Min, you`ve got the last word because we have to leave it there. Thank you all for sharing your reporting with us and thanks to all of you for watching.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wYnMub3JnL3dldGEvd2FzaGluZ3RvbndlZWsvdmlkZW8vMjAyMy8wNS90cnVtcC1hbmQtZGVzYW50aXMtdHJhZGUtYmFyYnMtYXMtZmxvcmlkYS1nb3YtaXMtc2V0LXRvLWFubm91bmNlLXByZXNpZGVudGlhbC1jYW1wYWlnbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Alan Hostetter, a former San Clemente resident who briefly led the La Habra Police Department, is serving as his own attorney and recently waived his right to a jury in order to be tried by a federal judge in a trial scheduled for early July. Hostetter is accused of conspiring with Russell Taylor, a Ladera Ranch entrepreneur, and four alleged far-right militia members from Riverside County in the lead-up to the Jan.6 breach of the U.S. Capitol.  In response to a routine procedural prosecution filing related to what evidence will be admitted at trial, Hostetter on Thursday, May 18 filed a lengthy motion that cites the Socratic Method before listing dozens of pages of questions, beginning with “What if everything we were ever taught about our history, our government, and the world in which we live is a lie?”  The bulk of the questions center on conspiracy theories raised by other Jan. 6 defendants and some conservative media members and politicians regarding the alleged role of federal agents and informants and “antifa” in the Capitol riot, as well as the historical actions of the FBI and CIA.  See also: List: These Southern California residents are accused of taking part in the Capitol riot  At one point in the filing, Hostetter asks whether “BLM/Antifa burned down half the big cities in this country, including Washington D.C. only months before” Jan. 6. Citing his broadcast of “video footage helpful” to Jan. 6 defendants, Hostetter also asks “Might that be why Tucker Carlson was fired from Fox News?” And in referencing Ashli Babbitt, the protestor shot and killed by an officer during the Capitol breach, Hostetter asks “Does the word Babbitt appear in the English dictionary?”  Hostetter is facing a variety of federal charges, including conspiracy and obstruction of an official proceeding, as well as disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted area.  Some of his questions seem far afield of Jan. 6.  At one point Hostetter wrote, “Do we now know our own government assassinated JFK?” In another portion of the filing he asked, “What are some occult symbols and meanings of the 1939 movie, ‘Wizard of Oz?’ “  The motion ends with a lengthy first-person narrative from Hostetter about having a religious awakening in 2021 during a morning walk on the beach that he writes turned him away from alcoholism.  The filing comes about a month after Taylor, Hostetter’s main co-defendant, admitted to organizing a group of “fighters” to travel to the U.S. Capitol, part of a plea deal in which Taylor has agreed to cooperate with federal prosecutors.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9jcmVnaXN0ZXIuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTkvZXgtbGEtaGFicmEtcG9saWNlLWNoaWVmLWFsYW4taG9zdGV0dGVyLWNpdGVzLWNvbnNwaXJhY3ktdGhlb3JpZXMtaW4tamFuLTYtcmVsYXRlZC1maWxpbmfSAYQBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub2NyZWdpc3Rlci5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8xOS9leC1sYS1oYWJyYS1wb2xpY2UtY2hpZWYtYWxhbi1ob3N0ZXR0ZXItY2l0ZXMtY29uc3BpcmFjeS10aGVvcmllcy1pbi1qYW4tNi1yZWxhdGVkLWZpbGluZy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Her aunt was fatally shot at the Hennepin County Government Center in 2003 by someone who purchased a gun at a show for $60 without a background check, Joseph said.  When Walz walked into the crowded reception room to sign the $3.5 billion public safety bill, he said, ""There's a reason the room is full because a vast majority of Minnesotans have been waiting too damn long for this.""  The new law expands background checks for gun sales at shows and transfers and creates a red-flag-style provision allowing family or law enforcement to petition a judge to take guns away from someone determined to be mentally unstable.  ""Minnesota is a better state,"" Walz said after sitting down to sign the bill with former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., at his side. Giffords survived an assassination attempt in 2011 near Tucson, but was left with a traumatic brain injury. She resigned from Congress in 2012 and started an organization called Giffords to promote gun control.  ""Be bold. Be courageous. The nation is counting on you,"" Giffords said.  She was one of many speakers at the event, some of them emotional, including Melissa Kennedy, a physician at the Buffalo Allina Health Clinic. She was there on Feb. 9, 2021, when a patient with mental health issues showed up and started shooting, killing Lindsay Overbay, a medical assistant with two young children.  Kennedy was wearing a gold necklace with 755 engraved on the front, the clinic's street number, and Overbay's initials on the back. Kennedy also wore a red T-shirt signaling her involvement in the national gun safety group Moms Demand Action.  The physician mentioned her three young children and said the fight isn't over. ""You will continue to see these red shirts show up and be fierce advocates for gun reform,"" she said.  Andre Locke Sr., left, father of Amir Locke, and Amir’s uncle Andrew Tyler shared an embrace after the bill signing. Amir Locke was fatally shot by Minneapolis police.  Not celebrating Friday was Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus lobbyist Rob Doar, who said in a statement that the bill had ""no Republican support and bipartisan opposition. Rather than address the root causes of gun deaths, Minnesota is attacking the Constitutional rights of Minnesota's peaceable gun owners.""  He said the gun caucus ""remains committed to engaging in meaningful dialogue on policies that are truly effective in reducing firearms-related deaths, not the unconstitutional and ineffective policies being passed into law today.""  Also speaking at the signing was Senate Judiciary Chair Ron Latz, DFL-St. Louis Park, who couldn't pinpoint a starting date on the gun provisions, saying they would take time to establish after the law takes effect July 1. He noted that he has been working on gun measures since 2002 and nodded to the DFL victories in November.  ""Elections matter,"" he said.  ""For me, it's a policy matter,"" he added of the new law. ""For a lot of people, it's a lot more than that.""  Richfield Police Chief Jay Henthorne spoke on behalf of the Minnesota Chiefs of Police Association, saying the gun changes won't prevent all violence but they will help.  Rep. Cedrick Frazier, DFL-New Hope, said he grew up evading gun violence on the south side of Chicago. ""I had to take this moment to do something, to take some action,"" he said.  While the signing was focused on the gun measures, the new public safety law holds many other dramatic changes for the criminal justice system.  It includes the Minnesota Rehabilitation and Reinvestment Act (MRRA), allowing prison inmates the possibility of cutting time off their sentences through education, training or treatment. It sets up a Clemency Review Commission and no longer requires Board of Pardons decisions to be unanimous.  Republicans have denounced the bill, calling the MRRA provision a ""get out of jail free card."" The new system is expected to take more than a year to set up.  Among the other changes, the new law prevents peace officers from joining or supporting hate or extremist groups. It also puts extreme limits on the use of no-knock warrants. And it creates new crimes of organized retail theft and car-jacking in a similar approach to federal racketeering laws. Strip searches of juveniles also will be restricted.  Other items in the sweeping law are a new Office of Missing and Murdered Black Women and Girls, and a requirement that hotel rooms have carbon monoxide alarms.

"assassination","2023-09-12","Not Discerned","{""Beirut"", ""Beirut"", ""Lebanon""}","2023-05-19T20:00:33","Imad Mughniyeh was responsible for more American deaths in terrorist attacks before the devastating 9/11 bombings and was able to outsmart not only the CIA but also the Mossad. Making matters even more difficult was the fact that no one knew what he looked like. By 2001, he was on the FBI’s Most Wanted Terrorist list with a $15 million bounty for information leading to his arrest. The reward was later bumped up to $25 million. He ultimately appeared on the most wanted list in 42 countries before he died was assassinated at the age of 45 in a car bombing in 2008.  Showtime’s new limited series “Ghosts of Beirut” shines the spotlight on the terrorist and the CIA and Mossad’s attempts to capture him. The Washington Post’s national security reporter Shane Harris recently conducted a Zoom conversation with co-creators Greg Barker and Avi Issacharoff and star Dina Shihabi.  “He’s one of the most fascinating characters I’ve ever come across,” said Barker. “He was a man who from ages 19, 21, outwitted the CIA and the Mossad and rose to incredible prominence in the Middle East as a key player in the region from nowhere. And he drove the agency and Mossad kind of crazy because they couldn’t find him. And his story plays out over two-and-a-half decades.”  And in Barker’s opinion, Mughniyeh shaped the modern CIA “from what happened in the 1980s, which resonates in the mid-2ooos. So, he was complicated. He was a guy from a poor family, a poor neighborhood, who started working as a bodyguard to Yasser Arafat in Beirut in the late ‘70s, early 80s. Kind of when the PLO left Beirut he sort of found an opening and was also recruited by Iranian intelligence, kind of stepped into a void and exploited that to his own ends and became, I think, sort of more powerful and more influential at an extremely young age than he ever imagined.”  It is shocking to learn just what terrorist events Mughniyeh was involved in.  “There’s the initial suicide bombing on an Israeli base in Tyre [Lebanon},” said Barker, “soon followed by an attack , a massive attack on the United State embassy in 1983 in Beirut, which killed hundreds of people and wiped out the entire CIA station at the time including-well I won’t give it away-one of the very, very prominent CIA officers who was on the cusp of what he hoped was a Middle East peace plan, a regional peace plan. You think about the Beirut hostage crisis in the ’80s, it was all Mughniyeh, including the kidnapping of the CIA U.S. station chief, William Buckley, which sort of brought the agency to its knees. And then he was a military strategist, so he was the architect of Hezbollah’s military strategy.”  Issacharoff explained the differences between Mughniyeh and Osama bin Laden. “Bin Laden was in a very twisted way talented in what he did. But Imad Mughniyeh was one level up if not two levels up. He was so sophisticated and smart and clever. He was very careful about his identity. He used nicknames all the time. He switched identities. He traveled to Iran. He traveled to Central America. He traveled to Africa. He met Osama bin Laden in Khartoum, Sudan, using a fake passport and he was very smart about the way he managed to maneuver everyone.”  And outmaneuvered the CIA and Mossad. “Over and over, they failed in trying to get him,” said Issacharoff. “But when they managed to collaborate and go together into the first-ever joint assassination attempt operation of the CIA and the Mossad, this is where the success came from including finding out about the way he looks, including about reaching his whereabouts and of course executing the assassination.”  Make your predictions at Gold Derby now.

U.S. Magistrate Judge David Hennessy said Jack Teixeira had ""breached his obligation"" to protect U.S. national security information.  Jack Teixeira has his second pre-trial release hearing in a federal court in Worcester, Massachusetts.  During the first hearing a month ago, his attorneys argued that other people accused under the Espionage Act have received bail and assured the judge that Teixeira wouldn't try to leave the country.  However, prosecutors used Teixeira’s online messages to suggest he was a threat to others.  In one post, he said he would ""kill a lot of people"" to ""cull the weak.""  This comes on the heels of a Justice Department filing that said Teixeira had been warned about mishandling classified information months before his April arrest.  According to internal memos filed in court, prosecutors said that the 21-year-old had received instructions in September to stop observing and taking notes on classified intelligence information. Despite this warning, he was cautioned once more in October. In February, Teixeira was apprehended once again for accessing information that the memo stated was ""not related to his primary duty and was related to the intelligence field,"" the Associated Press reported.  SEE MORE: Pres. Biden orders 'limitations' on classified material after leak  Federal prosecutors said Teixeira acknowledged he was breaking regulations, telling a friend that he didn't care ""what they say I can or can't share.""And they pointed to a video of Teixeira firing guns and uttering racist slurs. The new evidence follows photos FBI agents took of Teixeira's home, claiming he slept two feet from a loaded gun locker and wrote about aspirations to make an ""assassination van.""  The government's main strategy, is using Teixeira's former words against him successful in the first step of a trial the nation is closely watching.  Back in April, Teixeira was formally charged under the Espionage Act with possessing and disseminating highly classified national defense documents without authorization.

"assassination","2023-04-01","Not Discerned","{""Pietermaritzburg"", ""KwaZuluNatal"", ""SouthAfrica""}","2023-05-20T04:16:07","By Chris Ndaliso  The appointment of the Moerane Commission, which presented some “inconsistencies” in its findings, enabled the KZN government to be seen to be doing something about political killings.  This is the view of the Institute for Security Studies (ISS) when broached for comment on political murders and attempted murders.  ALSO READ | Assassination attempt on speaker’s life leaves bodyguard dead  ISS researcher and consultant David Bruce was asked by Weekend Witness to comment on recent attempts to allegedly kill IFP councillor Thinasonke Ntombela.  Last month, Ntombela was shot below the nose and the bullet lodged in his jawbone. His companion was shot in the face and arm but they both survived the assassination attempt.  Weeks afterwards a gunman walked into the office building of the IFP and pointed a gun at Ntombela’s secretary. He abandoned his actions when a car drove into the premises.  Bruce said, “There are some inconsistencies in the Moerane Commission findings.  For instance some of the recommendations are based on the idea that the key problem is one of political intolerance. This was relevant in the 1990s when violence in the province was partly linked to ideological differences between political groups. But, as the commission acknowledges, the key factor underpinning political killings is that political positions bolster financial and social status.  He said political positions were seen as a vehicle for advancing specific patronage networks and killings are targeted at people who are seen to threaten, or do not agree to advancing these networks.    He said there was a need for a peace process led by religious organisations or other civil society groups that is focused on the “toxic” political culture and the overall culture of violence in the province.  Global Initiative Against Transnational Organised Crime  Rumbi Matamba, an analyst at the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organised Crime (GI-TOC) believes that the commission’s recommendations have not been implemented since its report was published in 2018.  While the task force has investigated numerous killings, court processes are extremely slow and very few convictions have been secured to date. The trends explored in this report illustrate the urgent need to collect reliable, granular data on targeted killings, and the need to act proactively to intercept assassination plots, and to investigate and prosecute assassination cases with greater urgency.  Matamba said political killings nationally have increased from 24 in 2020 to 40 in 2022. She said KZN accounted for 21 of the 40 assassinations in SA in 2022.  ALSO READ | Brutal assassination stuns Pietermaritzburg  National police ministry spokesperson, Lirandzu Themba, said since 2018, the inter-ministerial committee (IMC) task team on political killings set up by the presidency has investigated 226 dockets, in which 251 arrests have been made in politically-related cases. She said 46 accused have been found guilty, of whom 30 were convicted for murder.  “These would be the latest stats, updated after the IMC meeting which is yet to be determined,” said Temba.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpdGl6ZW4uY28uemEvd2l0bmVzcy9uZXdzL2t6bi1nb3Zlcm5tZW50LW5vdC1kb2luZy1tdWNoLWFib3V0LXBvbGl0aWNhbC1raWxsaW5ncy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2023-05-21","Not Discerned","{""Kiev"", ""Kiev"", ""Ukraine""}","2023-05-19T09:35:50","After months of flat denials, the head of Ukrainian military intelligence has admitted that Kyiv is carrying out a campaign of sabotage and assassination inside Russia. But why change the official line now?  Even if this is a good cop/bad cop routine, it still risks embarrassing the president, raising questions as to how far he is fully in control of HUR  Major General Kyrylo Budanov, the head of the Main Directorate of Intelligence (HUR), has become one of the media stars of this war, not least thanks to an artfully curated public persona that a senior US intelligence official characterised as ‘George Smiley meets Jason Bourne.’ This week he took advantage of interviews on two separate YouTube channels to acknowledge a Ukrainian role in a spate of recent attacks in Russia. He also announced that the Ukrainian parliamentarian Yevhen Shevchenko held secret negotiations with Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko, on behalf of the intelligence agencies.  The attacks in Russia have ranged from the derailment of freight trains to bomb attacks on outspoken supporters of the war such as blogger Vladlen Tatarsky (killed in April) and author and militant Zakhar Prilepin (seriously injured earlier this month). It has long been presumed that HUR is the primary agency behind them, but until this month the agency had generally refused to confirm nor deny the truth behind the various allegations.  Then, though, Budanov told western journalists that ‘we’ve been killing Russians and we will keep killing Russians anywhere on the face of this world until the complete victory of Ukraine.’ This statement, alarming many in western diplomatic and intelligence communities in its starkness – Budanov refused to qualify which Russians he considered a legitimate target – nonetheless failed to make that much of a splash. This might explain why he chose to double down, celebrating that ‘we have already gotten many [Russian targets], including public and media personalities’ and claiming that the attacks were largely carried out ‘by citizens of the Russian Federation’ happy to work with HUR for ‘patriotic reasons.’  Most popular Gareth Roberts The sad decline of BBC Radio 4  Ukraine is stepping up its campaign of sabotage and assassination inside Russia, but Budanov is also no doubt continuing a campaign of psychological warfare. Although individual Russians have launched simple attacks such as firebombings of draft offices (and there have been claims of wider networks of anarchists and oppositionists) the larger-scale and more complex operations bear the hallmarks of professionals. Some Russians have been duped or blackmailed into sabotage, but Budanov’s claims of a wider anti-Kremlin terrorist movement is likely intended to rattle the security agencies and perhaps trigger a counter-productive crackdown. This is, after all, the man who also said that a coup was underway in Russia to topple Putin and who has a map in his office of a dismembered Russian Federation.  Budanov’s words also contradicted President Volodymyr Zelensky’s own repeated assertions that, as he said in Berlin just a couple of days before Budanov’s interviews, ‘we are not attacking Russian territory.’ To a degree this may well have always been disingenuous: leaked US intelligence documents (which have neither been confirmed nor denied) have Zelensky pondering seizing Russian border villages and even blowing up a pipeline taking Russian oil to Hungary.  Nonetheless, even if this is a good cop/bad cop routine, it still risks embarrassing the president, raising questions as to how far he is fully in control of HUR. According to the same trove of leaked documents, the CIA even had to intercede to get Budanov to stand down planned attacks on Russia on 24 February, the anniversary of the invasion. As an EU official put it, ‘Zelensky should have been able to squelch these ideas without the Americans having to negotiate with Budanov directly.’  The best things in life are free (for a month.

SUBSCRIBE  At 37, the youngest general in the Ukrainian military, and with a burgeoning personality cult to match his media profile – whenever there is some new disaster in Russia, social media abounds with images of him with glowing red eyes or grinning – Budanov is thought to have political ambitions for after the war.  Last year, there was talk of him replacing General Valery Zaluzhny, the head of the armed forces. A former special forces commando turned spymaster, now the avenging angel of the Ukrainian nation, it’s possible that Budanov is looking to a rather different campaign in the future, as well as his present one against Russia.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwZWN0YXRvci5jby51ay9hcnRpY2xlL3doeS1oYXMtdWtyYWluZS1hZG1pdHRlZC10aGF0LWl0LWFzc2Fzc2luYXRlcy1wZW9wbGUtaW4tcnVzc2lhL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2019-07-26","Not Discerned","{""Medellin"", ""Antioquia"", ""Colombia""}","2023-05-19T18:20:00","A notorious former commander of Colombia’s largest paramilitary group has revealed new details of how rightwing death squads worked side by side with the country’s business, military and political elite to sow terror in the countryside and wipe out leftwing insurgencies.  Salvatore Mancuso told Colombia’s peace tribunal this week that state institutions were not only complicit in the expansion of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) but actively coordinated with them, giving orders to wipe out anyone suspected of aligning with communist rebels.  “This phenomenon of paramilitarism came from the state,” Mancuso told the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP) on a video link from the US where he was extradited on drugs charges in 2008.  Mancuso was released from prison in 2020 and is seeking a reduced sentence from Colombia’s transitional justice system in exchange for divulging the human rights atrocities committed by the AUC – a key player in a brutal, six-decade-long conflict which has left 450,000 dead and millions displaced.  The AUC formed in the Córdoba region in the north of the country to protect landowners from guerrillas but rapidly expanded into one of the world’s biggest drug cartels. Most of its 20,000 combatants laid down their weapons in 2004 as part of a controversial peace process.  Salvatore Mancuso, former commander of the right-wing paramilitary group AUC, seen on screen during during ceremony where he apologised for his crimes. Photograph: Schneyder Mendoza/AFP/Getty Images  Mancuso, who was the AUC’s second in command, has admitted to orchestrating thousands of crimes and some of the darkest chapters in Colombian conflict – including massacres of unarmed civilians, torture and sexual violence.  In sessions lasting up to eight hours the former warlord this week gave grisly accounts of how the militia acted as an arm of the Colombian state to silence the political opposition and take on the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) guerrillas.  Mancuso said officials gave the AUC lists of individuals and communities with suspected ties to the communist rebels so they could intimidate, torture and assassinate them without consideration for the rules of war.  “Mancuso’s narrative was that the military was not strong enough to combat the guerrillas themselves and needed an extrajudicial force in order to carry out the scorched-earth tactics that they themselves could not,” says Elizabeth Dickinson, senior analyst for Colombia at International Crisis Group.  There was “enormous pressure” from the state to wipe targets out, Mancuso said. Those targets include Gustavo Petro, then a leftwing congressman and now the country’s president.  Members of United Self-Defense Forces (AUC) brandish automatic assault weapons during a training session in a rural area of Puerto Asis, Putumayo province, in 2000. Photograph: Reuters  Mancuso corroborated previous accusations that the army gave the order for another notorious killing, the 1998 assassination of Jaime Garzón, a beloved TV comedian and political activist.  “Anyone who was accused was eliminated. This is a pattern we learned hand in hand with the institutions of the state,” he said.  The AUC deeply infiltrated Colombian politics and in 2004 Mancuso was even invited to speak to congress to a standing ovation.  One of Mancuso’s most shocking new allegations was that the then president, Álvaro Uribe, removed the security unit for Eudaldo Díaz , a local mayor in the town of El Roble, so the AUC could torture and kill him in 2003.  Mancuso also alleged that Francisco Santos, then vice-president, requested that he form a new unit around Bogotá to prevent leftwing rebels from advancing on the capital.  Uribe and Santos have both denied Mancuso’s allegations.  Mancuso alleged that hundreds of businesses – including banana companies and multinationals such as Coca-Cola and Drummond – helped fund the AUC in the 1990s as it grew from a community of vigilantes into a national terror machine, while military generals trained and supplied the AUC commanders with helicopters and uniforms. Coca-Cola and Drummond have previously denied the allegations.  A former combatant of the AUC shows his tattoos during the first National Meeting of AUC ex-combatants in Puerto Boyacá, on 6 May. Photograph: Raúl Arboleda/AFP/Getty Images  “Mancuso’s testimony confirms that paramilitarism was not only an anti-subversive strategy but an economic one to make business leaders rich, to elect corrupt politicians in the highest ranks of the state and to spy on and intimidate politicians, lawyers and journalists,” says Julián Martínez, author of Chuzadas, a book documenting how the Colombian state spied on judges, journalists and the political opposition.  The army often planned their offensives together with paramilitaries so they could quash guerrilla fronts in pincer manoeuvres, Mancuso said.  “The territories in guerrilla areas were emptied,” he said.  When the number of civilian casualties began to rack up Mancuso says the attorney general’s office alerted the AUC ahead of investigations so they could burn the bodies.  Experts say Mancuso’s accounts advance the JEP’s mission to untangle the truth of Colombia’s conflict and offer reparation to victims.  The warlord will now have 30 days to provide evidence to support his claims, which could spark new investigations into some of Colombia’s most powerful political figures.  Mancuso’s testimony is vital to understand not just the past but the present as rightwing drug-trafficking organisations such as the Gulf Clan, which was founded by former AUC members who refused to disarm and continues to terrorise the countryside, picking off community leaders who oppose them.  “These same acts continue to be committed today, not in the name of the United Self-Defense Forces, but of the Gulf Clan and they too have extensive links with the state,” Martínez says.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS93b3JsZC8yMDIzL21heS8xOS9jb2xvbWJpYS1wYXJhbWlsaXRhcnktc2FsdmF0b3JlLW1hbmN1c28tYXVjLWRlYXRoLXNxdWFkc9IBZmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS93b3JsZC8yMDIzL21heS8xOS9jb2xvbWJpYS1wYXJhbWlsaXRhcnktc2FsdmF0b3JlLW1hbmN1c28tYXVjLWRlYXRoLXNxdWFkcw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","1968-04-04","Not Discerned","{""Memphis"", ""Tennessee"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T05:39:30","“Like an unchecked cancer, hate corrodes the personality and eats away its vital unity. Hate destroys a man’s sense of values and his objectivity. It causes him to describe the beautiful as ugly and the ugly as beautiful, and to confuse the true with the false and the false with the true.” — Martin Luther King Jr.  Maybe it wasn’t really all it was cracked up to be.  We learned in school and still see on the occasional documentary and in pop culture that all of America glued itself to its TV sets when man — not just man, but American men — finally landed on the moon. The event united the nation, they say, behind the common cause of engineering might, scientific prominence, and undying patriotism.  But that was 1969, just after the Stonewall Rebellion, a gay rights riot against police brutality in New York. Just before 250,000 protesters rallied against the Vietnam War in Washington. Just after the convictions of James Earl Ray for the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and Sirhan Sirhan for the assassination of Bobby Kennedy. Just before the Hell’s Angels killed four people at the Rolling Stones’ concert at Altamont Speedway.  The moon landing happened smack dab in the middle of American upheaval over civil rights, free speech, and the Vietnam War. That upheaval continued right up to the moment Neil Armstrong’s boot touched the lunar surface and lasted long after Apollo 11 returned to Earth.  If the lunar landing united this country, it did so fleetingly.  Same with so many other “unifying” moments. The patriotism during World War II eventually gave way to the tumult of the civil rights era, and there were race riots in Detroit and elsewhere during the war. The national mourning over the death of John F. Kennedy quickly gave way to the ongoing bedlam of the 60s. The national celebration of the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Soviet Union gave way relatively quickly to Waco and the Rodney King riots. The unprecedented national unity following 9/11 fell away to protests over the Iraq War.  Since then, we’ve had the Great Recession, which led to the rise of the tea party on the right and the Occupy Wall Street movement on the left, now antifa on one side and right-wing militias on the other.  Some part of me and a lot of other people longs for some big, unifying moment or some leader who will step out of the void and bring this nation together, but a quick review of the historical record reveals perennial division despite national successes and calamities and regardless of who occupies the White House or which party controls Congress.  I suppose when you have 300 million people of multiple cultures spread out over as big a geographic landscape as America, you’re bound to have differences of opinion.  When the stakes get higher — when lives and livelihoods and entire ways of life hinge on the outcome of policy — then those differences become starker and the fight over them louder.  That’s what’s happening right now.  Today’s issues — climate change, gun violence, inflation, immigration, election security, culture wars, even artificial intelligence — have severe consequences. People are losing their lives. They’re losing their jobs. They’re using up life savings. They’re concerned their voices don’t matter when they go to the polls. They’re losing their homes.  People are understandably loud, looking for salvation.  The problem is, with many of those issues, one person’s salvation is another’s damnation.  The way to solve climate change, for example, is to get off fossil fuels, but every coal plant closure means somebody loses their job. One way to curb gun violence is to limit access to guns, but that means somebody’s going to feel their Second Amendment rights have been violated. The way to slow inflation is to raise interest rates, but that means it costs more to borrow.  So half the country will feel relief coming from the White House, the Capitol, or statehouses, while the other half will feel cursed.  The cursed will yell and those feeling relief will yell back, and the divisions will continue.  History tells us the end to those divisions can’t come from some grand unifying moment or from a unifying leader.  It must come from us.  We must realize that everybody — or at least most people — yell what they yell because they, like everybody else, want what’s best for themselves, their family, their country.  If we can realize that, if we can realize everybody’s motivated by essentially the same thing as us, maybe we can stop hating them for it and instead commiserate a little, understand a little, and find a way to move on.

On the morning of November 22, 1963, President John F. Kennedy and his wife, Jackie, arrived in Dallas, Texas, for a series of appearances. The president was later fatally shot while riding in a motorcade through the city.  The pink suit that Kennedy was wearing at the time would soon become a symbol of the tragic day that John F. Kennedy was assassinated.  ""If there is a single item that captures both the shame and the violence that erupted that day, and the glamour and artifice that preceded it, it is Jackie Kennedy's bloodstained pink suit, a tantalizing window on fame and fashion, her allure and her steely resolve, the things we know about her and the things we never quite will,"" New York Times fashion critic Cathy Horyn wrote in 2013.  Here are six things you might not know about the former first lady's outfit, from its current location to when it will be unveiled to the public for the first time.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc2lkZXIuY29tL2phY2tpZS1rZW5uZWR5LXBpbmstc3VpdC1mYWN0cy1sb2NhdGlvbi1zdG9yYWdlLTIwMjMtNdIBUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc2lkZXIuY29tL2phY2tpZS1rZW5uZWR5LXBpbmstc3VpdC1mYWN0cy1sb2NhdGlvbi1zdG9yYWdlLTIwMjMtNT9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

In a heartfelt post, the former NFL star shared a serene black and white image of the leader and chose to refer to him by his title, X, instead of his birth name.  As the 100th birth anniversary and 60th assassination anniversary of Malcolm X approach in two years, there has been a renewed interest in his life. At the age of 39, he was tragically assassinated on February 21, 1965.  70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) Unlock Free tips from our Experts Get Picks Now  Dez Bryant's previous comments about empowerment and Malcolm X  This is not the first time that Malcolm X has been at the forefront of Dez Bryant's mind. During his playing career, Bryant expressed profound thoughts on black empowerment. In 2017, he shared a series of Instagram posts, excerpts of which were published by the Dallas Morning News.  He said that he has been racially profiled before but saw the issue of racism larger than that. He concluded that everyone from every community had the opportunity to lead by example, writing,  ""I've been [racially] profiled on numerous occasions, but not once has it influenced an ill feeling inside me about anyone outside of that issue. REAL SLAVERY is different from what's going on in our world now. We all (every ethnicity) have the opportunity to lead by EXAMPLE.""  He also took to task people who talk about history of racism but do not focus on individual or community accountabilty. He said,  ""Instead of making videos about the history of racism that get applause or people with influence merely doing things to post for social media, we should focus on individual accountability to be better as a whole.""  It was in this context that he invoked Malcolm X among others. Dez Bryant said that civil rights leaders like him paved the path for them so that they do not have to carry the historical burden again but lead by example, instead.  ""We focus hard on fighting the realities that exist instead of creating our own reality. The ones who came for us (Martin Luther King, Rosa Parks, Malcolm X) paved a new path for us to follow. The struggles and hurt they endured created new life for us today. It is not our job to carry the burden, but it is our job to lead by example.""  Dez Bryant expressed his gratitude to the civil rights pioneer for the path he forged, making it easier for people like Bryant to navigate their own journeys.

"assassination","2023-05-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T15:53:46","On Friday 19 May, Slovak businessman Marian Kocner was acquitted by the Special Criminal Court of ordering the assassination of journalist Jan Kuciak. The investigative journalist of the online outlet Aktuality.sk was killed with his fiancée Martina Kusnirova on 21 February 2018 in their home in Velka Maca, Slovakia. They were both 27 years old.  The court said that “it was not proven” beyond reasonable doubt that Kocner had ordered the assassination of Jan Kuciak. Although before his killing the journalist had been threatened by Kocner due his articles about the businessman’s activities, “a high degree of suspicion is not enough,” the court said, adding that “in case of doubt, the doubt must be interpreted in favor of the defendant.”  Marian Kocner was also acquitted of ordering the murders of three Slovak prosecutors for which he was judged in the same trial.  The businessman’s associate Alena Zsuzsova was, on the contrary, found guilty of ordering the execution of the reporter five years ago. Convicted also for plotting to assassinate two Slovak prosecutors, Zsuzsova was sentenced to 25 years of prison. Her guilt “was proved beyond reasonable doubt” by both direct and indirect evidence, according to the court. The court awarded damages worth 160 thousand euros to be paid by Zsuzsova to the family of Jan Kuciak.  During the retrial, new evidence proving Kocner and Zsuzsova’s guilt was presented, especially a more in-depth analysis of their encrypted messaging between the two. Nevertheless, Kocner was acquitted by a majority of two votes over one by the three-judge panel. The decision to convict Zsuzsova was taken unanimously.  When they heard the verdict, the parents of the journalist and his fiancée left the courtroom. They announced filing appeals. These will be examined by the Supreme Court.  Today’s judicial decision came after a retrial ordered by the Supreme Court when it quashed the 2021 acquittal of Kocner and Zsuzsova. The retrial was merged with a trial over attempts to assassinate three prosecutors.  The businessman and his associate have both been in prison since their arrest in 2018. Kocner, who had links to the former government party Smer, has since been sentenced to 19 years in prison for an attempt to extort 70 million euros from Slovakia’s biggest commercial media, TV Markiza. Zsuzsova is currently serving a 21-year prison term for organizing the assassination of a Slovak mayor.  All the other persons charged with the murder of Jan Kuciak and Martina Kusnirova - two hitmen and a middleman who cooperated with the justice - have already been definitely sentenced for the crime to long prison terms.  On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the assassination, a new platform for protection of journalists was launched by the Investigative Centre of Jan Kuciak with the financial and technical support of RSF.  Slovakia is ranked 17th out of 180 countries in the 2023 World Press Freedom Index established by RSF.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vcnNmLm9yZy9lbi9raWxsaW5nLWpvdXJuYWxpc3QtamFuLWt1Y2lhay1yc2YtdGFrZXMtbm90ZS1jb252aWN0aW9uLW1hc3Rlcm1pbmQtYW5kLWRlcGxvcmVzLWRlYmFjbGUtanVkaWNpYWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Al-Quds Brigades fighters during the central festival of Avenging the Free (Social media)  The Joint Operations Room of the Palestinian Resistance factions stressed on Friday that it had the upper hand and delivered the last blow during Operation Avenging the Free, which the Resistance launched in response to the recent Israeli aggression against Gaza.  The Resistance has never allowed the Israeli occupation to unilaterally achieve its goals, the Operations Room underlined during a speech at the central festival of Avenging the Free, which the Palestinian Jihad (PIJ) Movement held in the Gaza Strip, Jenin, Lebanon, and Syria, in commemoration of the martyrs of the recent aggression on Gaza.  It confirmed that it thwarted the policy of Israeli occupation Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in achieving his objectives through assassinations.  The Joint Operations Room affirmed that this battle has proven, and will prove in the coming days, that the Israeli assassinations and crimes have only boosted the Resistance and the Palestinian people's determination to crush the arrogance of the occupier.  It underlined that the Resistance and Al-Quds Brigades have proven their ability to withstand and fulfill all their promises, pointing out that the response was clear in Al-Quds and ""Tel Aviv"" and in all illegal Israeli settlements.  It noted that what the Israeli occupation conceals is much greater than what appears on television and media.  The Resistance factions warned the Israeli occupation ""against any assassination or foolishness,"" adding, ""We stick to our promise and vow to respond with full force in the enemy's depth in a unified manner without any hesitation. The enemy got to experience what we are capable of.""  The Operations Room urged all the free people in the world to stand up to their responsibilities toward the central cause of the nation - Palestine. It also called to direct all energies and harness all capabilities to repel the Israeli occupation of Palestine.  Elsewhere, the Joint Operations Room of the Palestinian Resistance Factions dedicated this political and military field achievement to the heroic Palestinian people, prisoners, and the Axis of Resistance, which was a backbone in all stages of the confrontation with the Israeli occupation.  Last week, an Egyptian-mediated ceasefire ended a five-day Israeli aggression against Gaza, that left 33 Palestinian martyrs, including six PIJ commanders, and more than 100 injuries.

"assassination","2023-03-04","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T21:40:00","Suspended Negros Oriental Rep. Arnolfo Teves Jr. insisted on Friday that his life is in danger, as “proven” by a Bureau of Immigration order to “instantaneously intercept” him if he returns to the Philippines.  “This seems to be the true reason why they want me to come home. There is an order that when I arrive, I will be intercepted. What is more curious [is] that the order came out even before they filed a case against me,” Teves said in video posted on his social media page. He went on: “This means that even without a case against me, there’s already an order to intercept me. This is obviously political persecution and an abuse of my human rights.”  ADVERTISEMENT  Teves showed screenshots of a message supposedly from Immigration Commissioner Norman Tansingco, but he did not explain why he considered the order extraordinary or threatening.  As part of usual entry formalities in any jurisdiction, Customs, immigration and quarantine (CIQ) officers are authorized to “intercept,” question and sometimes detain an arriving individual, particularly if the person is wanted by the law.  Teves did not explain where he was or if he planned to return to the country after government lawyers filed multiple charges for the Mar. 4 killing of Negros Oriental Gov. Roel Degamo and nine of his supporters.  The lawmaker maintained that even with several counts of murder, attempted murder and frustrated murder against him, “I am still innocent until proven guilty.”  “I should not be intercepted, I should not be arrested, and I should not be jailed,” Teves said, adding: “Now, you know why I do not want to come home.”  Teves is not required to appear at the prosecutors’ preliminary investigation of the charges, but he would be required to appear before a court at an arraignment, if prosecutors find probable cause for the charges. Teves’ 60-day suspension will also expire on May 22, and the House ethics and privileges panel will be meeting once more to discuss his case if Teves refuses to come home and report for work.  The DOJ officials said Teves’ repeated insistence about threats to his life may be part of a bid to find asylum in another country.  Timor-Leste has already rejected Teves’ petition for asylum after it expressed awareness that the representative was wanted for a ramp of serious crimes.Face the accusations  For Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla, the best solution for Teves was to face the accusations against him in court. “He should just come home,” Remulla said on Friday. “He’s throwing a lot at us, but are we the ones who killed 10 people? Just come home and face the charges. He’s the one who’s wanted.”  ADVERTISEMENT  In another development, one of the 11 suspects arrested for the multiple murder complained to the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) that the National Bureau of Investigation had abducted his family.  Former soldier Jhudiel Rivero, alias Osmundo Rivero, said in the letter, dated May 9, that the local government of Balog, Zamboanga del Sur, brought his wife and two children to Manila for unknown reasons.  But Remulla said that the family’s transfer was part of Rivero’s deal with the DOJ in exchange for his testimony.  “That was for the Witness Protection Program, so he saw his family. Rivero himself requested that. He saw his family. We’re not gonna do that if he didn’t request it,” Remulla said, welcoming inquiries from the CHR.  “These are the things [meant] to throw us off focus. We will remain focused on these cases. Because they are the accused for these crimes,” Remulla added.  g/  Your subscription could not be saved. Please try again. Your subscription has been successful.

"assassination","2023-05-11","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T17:11:20","Veteran Palestinian journalist Shireen Abu-Akleh was covering an Israeli raid on Jenin Refugee Camp in her official capacity as a reporter for Al Jazeera on May 11, 2022, when an unnamed Israeli sniper fired a bullet into the thin space between the back of her helmet and her flak jacket, killing her. At the time, Abu-Akleh was fleeing Israeli gunfire directed towards her and other observing journalists, including Al Jazeera producer Ali Al-Samudi, who was wounded moments before Abu-Akleh’s death.    One year later, Israeli military forces have issued an apology for killing Shireen Abu Akleh. This follows countless reports from journalist eyewitnesses, analyses by multiple international outlets, condemnation from world governments, and a joint investigation which determined Israeli forces deliberately targeted Abu Akleh. Israel’s admission thus reflects a definitive loss of the narrative battle over the course of a full year rather a morally-directed decision. Al Jazeera Front Lines senior producer Kavitha Chekuru joins The Chris Hedges Report to discuss Abu Akleh’s assassination and the status of her case one year later.  Kavitha Chekuru is a senior producer for Al Jazeera’s Front Lines, which released the documentary The Killing of Shireen Abu Akleh last December.  Studio Production: Cameron Granadino, Adam Coley, David Hebden, Darian Jones  Post-Production: Adam Coley  Audio Post-Production: Tommy Harron  Transcript  Chris Hedges: Shireen Abu Akleh, the Al Jazeera reporter with more than two decades of experience covering armed conflicts, knew the protocol. She and other reporters remained in the open, clearly visible to Israeli snipers about 650 ft away. Her flak jacket was emblazoned with the word, “Press.” There were two initial rounds of shooting that were fired at the journalists. In the first, producer Ali Al-Samudi was shot.  As the journalist turned to run away from the gunfire, Shireen was shot below her helmet during the second round, according to the human rights organization Al-Haq. There were a few seconds when the Israeli sniper clearly saw a profile in his scope, of Abu Akleh, one of the most recognizable faces in the Middle East. The accuracy of the M16, – Especially the M16A4, equipped with the advanced combat optical gun sight, a prismatic telescopic sight – Is very high.  In the fighting in Fallujah, for example, so many dead insurgents were found with head wounds that observers at first thought they had been executed. The bullet that killed Abu Akleh was deftly placed between the very slim opening separating her helmet and the collar of her flak jacket. I have been in combat, including in clashes between Israeli and Palestinian forces. Snipers are dreaded on a battlefield because each kill is calculated. The execution of Abu Akleh was not an accident: she was singled out for elimination.  Whether this killing was ordered by commanding officers, or whether it was the whim of an Israeli sniper, I cannot answer. Israelis shoot so many Palestinians with impunity. My guess is, the sniper knew he or she could kill Abu Akleh, and never face any consequences. The shooting, Al Jazeera said in a statement, was “A blatant murder violating international laws and norms.”  “Abu Akleh” the network added, was “assassinated in cold blood.” Abu Akleh, who was 51 and a Palestinian American, was a familiar and trusted presence on television screens throughout the region, revered for her courage and integrity, and beloved for her careful and sensitive reporting on the intricacies of daily life under occupation. Her reporting from the occupied territories routinely punctured Israeli narratives, and exposed Israeli abuses and crimes, making her the bête noire of the Israeli government. It is very hard to believe she was not a deliberate target.  Joining me to discuss the murder of Abu Akleh, and the refusal by the Biden administration to hold Israel accountable for the killing, is Kavitha Chekuru, a senior producer for the Al Jazeera show Fault Lines that produced the investigative report titled The Killing of Shireen Abu Akleh.  Kavitha, this is a wonderful report. It’s on YouTube, everyone should watch it. You did a tremendous job piecing together the narrative of what happened. I want you to begin at the beginning, and one of the reasons that we were able to determine what happened, is because we have video footage of it — From phones, and everything else, and cameras — That we don’t have for most Palestinians.  And then as you go forward, I wondered if you could lay out the Israeli response, and how it’s typical of Israel, in terms of first attempting to blame the victim, and how that shifted? But talk about the initial report coming in that she was shot, what you knew, and then what happened, and then we’ll get into your investigation.  Kavitha Chekuru: Sure. That day, May 11, the crew was in Jenin, which is a city in the Northern West Bank. In the weeks preceding that, there had been a series of increasing Israeli military raids. Shireen and her colleagues, as well as other journalists, had been covering them, and that day was no exception.  Shireen and everyone there, are experienced journalists. They know how to cover conflict and they know how to cover this conflict, in particular. When they got news of the raid, Ali Al-Samudi – A producer and journalist based in Jenin, who worked with Shireen for two decades – He called her and told her what was going on: that the raid had begun. So she and the Al Jazeera crew left their hotel. They met up with Ali, as well as other journalists that were there already, and they waited. They had their helmets on, their press jackets, and they waited to make sure it was safe.  They were away from the fighting itself. When they initially looked at the scene, they were a few blocks away from where they could see an Israeli convoy. In other footage that’s come up from civilians on the ground and from the Israeli military themselves – They put out body camera footage later on, and I’ll talk about that. It’s part of their response as well – But I mentioned the footage, because it shows you where they were, which will become important as well in the Israeli military response.  What they saw was a convoy of five Israeli military vehicles, about 650ft or 200m away. They waited, there were no shots, it seemed like it was calm. As the survivors of the incident told us, when they deemed it to be safe, they started walking very slowly. They all had on their press jackets, again, saying, “Press.”  I will say that when we went to Jenin –To the spot where this happened – If you look from the spot where the convoy was, down the road to where the journalists were, you wouldn’t even need a telescopic rifle to see. This was a very short distance. It was visible to us with our naked eye, people at that distance. When you’re looking through a telescope, it’s going to be even closer, even more obvious, than what they’re looking at.  They start to walk, and all of a sudden, shots start firing. They turned, Ali was hit. The Al Jazeera cameraman immediately started to record. He was a bit of a distance away from the others. That footage in particular became very crucial, because one, it gave us the number of shots fired. But it also really gave us… I mean, it’s horrible footage; it’s Shireen on the ground, and you see the way the shots continued even after that, particularly as her colleagues and civilians tried to help her.  Chris Hedges: Well, I just want to interrupt. Because in the film, every time somebody approached her – And she’s prone face down on the ground – They’re fired at.  Kavitha Chekuru: Exactly. Exactly. It becomes a bit hard to think this was just being caught in crossfire, when any time someone tries to help her, they’re targeted again. Eventually, they were able to get her body away, they went to the hospital, and she was pronounced dead. One of the things I should point out is that – If your viewers and listeners aren’t aware – Shireen Abu Akleh was a household name in the Middle East; she was very well known. She had been covering Palestine for Al Jazeera since 1997. This was a shock for us to hear this person had been killed.  There was a very quick response from the military. They said, well, there was fighting going on. It could have been Palestinian fighters that killed her. They quickly released a video. Actually, there were two videos. One was a video they had taken from fighters themselves that they had released – At a location in Jenin where they had been shooting from – Saying that this could be where the fight or the killers were. Then they released video themselves: body camera footage showed their own location and the configuration of the convoy. This was within just a few hours of the shooting itself.  Again, the footage from all parties involved becomes so important when you’re trying to dissect everything that’s happening. That footage they had taken from Palestinian fighters saying, this is the location of the fighters, B’Tselem – Which is an Israeli human rights group – Very quickly sent one of their researchers to that exact site and showed that it was not possible for those fighters in that location, or any of the Palestinian fighters that day who had been more inside Jenin. There was no clean shot, essentially. It was very windy. It would’ve had to be a magic bullet for it to have been Palestinian fighters, is what I’m saying.  You see this a lot when the Israeli military is accused of killing civilians, of killing Palestinians. This is a pretty tried and true strategy: cast out, let the doubt spread, and then it filters into the press even. But it was impossible to do that in this case, particularly because of the video footage that was available from the Al Jazeera camera person, as well as another civilian who had been filming on his cell phone right before the shooting started.  Chris Hedges: The Israeli narrative mutates, that’s also not uncommon. Talk a bit about its mutation. How, as facts come out, the Israelis respond.  Kavitha Chekuru: Yeah. The first response was to say that it might’ve been Palestinians, and then it’s a little bit of a step back. It’s like, well, maybe it was, but maybe not. We don’t know. And then it’s like, well we need to see, because it could have been us, but we don’t know yet. There’s the waiting game, essentially. As that waiting game goes on, in the meantime, various investigations come out from respective news outlets: from the EBP to CNN, the New York Times, The Washington Post, as well as human rights groups like B’Tselem. The United Nations did their own investigation. All of them said it was likely that it came from Israel, but it was the Israeli military that shot her.  Finally, it was in September that the Israeli military put out their final conclusion, because they said that they were conducting an investigation. And their investigation said that, yes, they may have shot her, but that it’s because she got caught in crossfire. The problem is that it’s disputed by witness testimony, and that again, video footage is available. But there haven’t been any consequences. Yeah. They said-  Chris Hedges: Let’s talk about the US response. Shireen was a US citizen, and it’s very telling of the collusion between Israel and Washington, the Biden administration. Talk about the US response, US promises, and investigation. Go into what happened.  Kavitha Chekuru: Yeah. Very quickly, the US was asked about what they were going to do. Like you pointed out, she was an American citizen. At first they said, well we want all the facts. We deplore this, this is awful. The things that they normally say. In June, Secretary of State Blinken said that he wanted a thorough and independent – And that’s the keyword here, independent – Investigation into her killing, so that they can know the facts. The independence is really the key here.  There’s a US office in Israel and Palestine called the US Security Coordinator. Essentially it’s run between the State Department, and the DOD. They were responsible for looking into the killing, initially. They were already starting to go along with the Israeli conclusion by that point, not the Palestinian conclusion, the Israeli conclusion. That’s lying. She was killed by the Israeli military, but it was a crossfire. They were leaning on the crossfire to say it was an accident. In the aftermath, they’ve really stuck to that. One of the things that they’ve also said is that, well, they want to make sure that this never happens again.  So then the question becomes, how do you make sure that this doesn’t happen again? There has to be accountability. But the problem is that you need to have real investigations with real consequences. Otherwise, what you end up with is impunity. That’s what’s happening here, because the US is going along with the Israeli lie. It opens the door to this continuing on. Because if there are no consequences in the killing of a US citizen, a renowned journalist, then what does that mean just for Palestinian civilians?  Chris Hedges: Let’s talk about the bullet, because the Palestinians have the bullet that was extracted from Shireen’s body. The Israelis say they cannot have a conclusive investigation unless they are provided with the bullet. For obvious reasons, the Palestinian Authority is very reticent to give the bullet to the Israelis. And then the Americans step in. Can you speak about what happened?  Kavitha Chekuru: Yeah. The US security coordinator did say that they did a forensic analysis of the bullet, but that it was inconclusive.  Chris Hedges: Well, the US promised an independent investigation if they were provided with the bullet. The bullet was provided to the US and then what happened?  Kavitha Chekuru: The US was provided with the bullet. They did analyze it, and they said that it was inconclusive. But there’s been no independent investigation. However, in November, the news broke that the FBI was going to investigate. Now, there’s not a lot of facts surrounding that though, I will point out. It came out more than 6 months after she was killed. By that point the US had made clear what their stance was on this killing and the idea of investigation, which was there wasn’t going to be an independent investigation run by the US. That was off the table. When it comes to the DOJ and the FBI, their investigations are supposed to be independent of the administration.  There’s not a lot of facts about when this investigation is happening, or if it has already happened, for instance. What we do know though is that Israel isn’t going to cooperate. The Israeli government made that clear. This was the previous government, which is not as right-wing as the current one. I think it’s pretty safe to say that the current one is not going to be cooperating either.  Chris Hedges: Talk about her funeral.  Kavitha Chekuru: Her funeral? I will say, I wasn’t there. I was watching it as a spectator from the States. There had been a state funeral first in Ramallah on May 12, the day before. And then on May 13, they brought her body to Jerusalem to be laid to rest in a Christian cemetery in the old city. And thousands of Palestines had come out to mourn her. This footage was being broadcast live, the whole procession on Al Jazeera English, and Al Jazeera. As soon as they brought the coffin out of the morgue and they started to leave the gates of the hospital to begin the rest of the procession, they were attacked by Israeli security forces in Jerusalem.  It’s shocking. Shocking footage of the way that the security forces attacked these mourners who were carrying the coffin. What her brother told us when we spoke to him was it felt like they were trying to make the mourners drop the coffin.  Chris Hedges: Well, then the coffin almost falls to the ground.  Kavitha Chekuru: Yeah. The mourners made sure to keep it up while they were being beaten. In the footage, you can see them ripping away the Palestinian flag. If people have not watched that footage, I would encourage them to watch it.  Chris Hedges: What do you think the message that Israel intended to impart with the killing, and with the response to the killing? What were they saying, in particular, to the Palestinians?  Kavitha Chekuru: It’s interesting when you think about when journalists are killed in a situation when it’s not a traditional, or typical war. We’re not talking about Ukraine. This may seem a little bit crazy, but earlier in the year I was covering the killings of journalists in Mexico. I think there’s a commonality when you look at why journalists are targeted in these non-traditional conflicts. People don’t want certain things to be known. They don’t want journalists there to document the truth, and I think that’s the case here. We asked that question to the journalists that were there on the day of the shooting and who had been shot at as well. They said the same thing that they think the Israeli government doesn’t want what is happening in the occupied territories to come out, because the situation is getting worse. More Palestinians were killed in the occupied West Bank last year than any year since, I think, 2004, 2005.  Chris Hedges: When you carried out this investigation, what surprised you the most?  Kavitha Chekuru: The US, they have a tendency – It’s not like this is new – But the way that they are ignoring the very clear facts of what happened. This idea that they have continued to say she was caught in crossfire is a blatant lie. There’s footage that shows that’s not true. It’s that audacity to continue to lie when we’re talking about the killing of a US citizen. That might have been something that stuck with me.  Chris Hedges: Netanyahu’s new government is even more extreme than the old government. And neo-fascist probably isn’t too far from, certainly what many elements of that government is comprised of. It’s a coalition government with the most extreme figures in the Israeli political establishment, many heirs of the terrorist Rabbi Meir Kahane. Where do you see this going? What’s going to happen now?  Kavitha Chekuru: It’s a good question. To be blunt, nowhere good. If we’re talking about what it means for Palestinians, in particular, we’ve seen there’s actually been a lot of protests by Israeli citizens themselves against this new government already.  Chris Hedges: Yeah. But mostly around judicial reform, if I have that correct, not about the occupation.  Kavitha Chekuru: No. But if we’re talking specifically for Palestinians, there’s nothing good. The government has even made it very, very clear from day one that this is going to be the most extreme Israeli government in recent memory, and that they regard Palestinian land as Israeli land. Even looking at the way settlers have been acting in the past couple of weeks, in particular, you can see that emboldenment. So it’s even more important that journalists are able to do their job in occupied territories.  Chris Hedges: Where are we going? I think Al Jazeera wants to bring this before the International Criminal Court, if I have that correct? They don’t want to let it drop.  Kavitha Chekuru: Yeah. I should say, I don’t want to speak as a representative for Al Jazeera in that way, because it’s a legal case, and I don’t think I’m really qualified to do that.  Chris Hedges: But they are seeking redress in international forums. Maybe you can at least explain that.  Kavitha Chekuru: Yeah. They did bring a petition to the ICC at the beginning of December. There has been a wider petition from Palestine human rights groups and lawyers in regards to the Israeli occupation, and for the ICC to investigate. I would say this is one part of that. Getting accountability in any situation where it’s a Palestinian killed by the Israeli military, very rarely is there justice. I hope that’s not the case here, but if you look at the past, it tells you that it’s very difficult to achieve.  Chris Hedges: Great. That was Kavitha Chekuru, the producer of The Killing of Shireen Abu Akleh on Al Jazeera, which can be found on YouTube.

Hossein Salami, the chief commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC), made the remarks when addressing a commemoration ceremony in the central province of Isfahan, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported.  Elaborating on Tehran's revenge for the U.S. assassination of Soleimani in January 2020, Salami said Iran threw the first ""slap"" by launching missiles at U.S. Ain al-Asad base in the Iraqi province of Anbar just a few days after Soleimani's death.  ""The second slap is nothing but the U.S. gradual pullout from the region,"" the commander said, noting the ""third slap"" has not been delivered yet.  On Jan. 3, 2020, the U.S. military assassinated Soleimani in a drone strike near the Baghdad International Airport. The assassination was condemned by Iran as ""state terrorism.""  In January this year, a senior Iranian judicial official said 94 U.S. nationals have been charged with involving in Soleimani's assassination, stressing that no one will be immune from prosecution in this case. ■","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vZW5nbGlzaC5uZXdzLmNuLzIwMjMwNTIwL2JmYTFiZDMyNTllNTRjY2JiMWY4OTI1OTc4ODY0MDg3L2MuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The production will begin June 18 and run through July 16, with opening night set for June 25. Golden Globe winner Debbie Allen is directing. It will also mark basketball star LeBron James' first foray into theatrical producing.  Fisher, who performed the role in the play's Off-Broadway premiere at New York Theatre Workshop in 2013, will co-star alongside The Bear star and Obie Award winner Edwin Lee Gibson as Hollywood icon Stepin Fetchit (a stage name for Lincoln Perry). Gibson originally helped develop the role with Power, but did not perform in the work's Off-Broadway run.  Inspired by true events, the work tracks the unlikely friendship between the heavyweight champion and Fetchit. The latter, a somewhat controversial figure, is considered the first successful Black film actor, but he primarily found that success playing roles deeply steeped in racist stereotypes—his onscreen persona was famously billed as ""The Laziest Man in the World.""  Fisher and Gibson will be joined by Wilkie Ferguson II as Brother Rashid, Alexis Floyd as Sonji Clay, and Bruce Nozick as William Fox.  “It’s extraordinary to see these characters come to life through Will Power’s creative and dynamic writing,” says Allen in a statement. “The play really paints a picture of the climate of Hollywood in the 1930s when Step was the highest paid Black actor of the time, and then in 1965 when heavyweight champion Ali prepared for his second bout with Sonny Liston and had to face the ramifications and tensions around declaring his embrace of the Nation of Islam in the wake of the Malcom X assassination. I’m really looking forward to the rehearsal process and exploring these complexities with the actors and creative team.”  The California production will feature set design by Sibyl Wickersheimer, costume design by Sara Ryung Clement, lighting design by Tom Ontiveros, sound design by Lindsay Jones, and projection design by Pablo Molina. Casting is by Kim Coleman, and Ed De Shae is stage manager.  The production will be the first stage project for The SpringHill Company, founded by LeBron James and Maverick Carter to develop and produce works about sports and entertainment.

"assassination","2002-03-01","Not Discerned","{""Bombay"", ""Maharashtra"", ""India""}","Fri 19 May 2023 03:32:22","New Delhi: The killing of terrorist outfit Khalistan Commando Force (KCF) head Paramjit Singh Panjwar in Lahore on 6 May has brought back the spotlight on a list of 20 wanted criminals and terrorists that India handed to Pakistan for their extradition over two decades ago in 2002.  Apart from Panjwar, the list include wanted criminals and terrorists from Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, as well as those accused of hijacking the IC-814 in 1999 and those involved in the 1993 Mumbai blasts who had fled to Pakistan.  Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) chief Masood Azhar, 26/11 mastermind and Lashkar-e-Taiba co-founder Hafiz Mohammed Saeed, Hizbul Mujahideen founder Syed Salahuddin, fugitive don Dawood Ibrahim and his key associate Chhota Shakeel are among the other wanted men.  ThePrint looks into where some of the remaining mentioned in the list are — starting with Masood Azhar and those associated with the IC-814 Indian Airlines hijacking.  JeM founder Masood Azhar was among three top terrorists released by India as part of the hostage release deal following the Indian Airlines IC 814 plane hijack by his brother and supporters.  Upon his release, the Bahawalpur-based maulana-cum-mercenary founded JeM which attacked Parliament on December 13, 2001. Azhar is also wanted for an attack on the Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) Assembly on October 1, 2001, in which 38 people were killed.  In 2008, he was connected to the 26/11 terrorist attacks in Mumbai. Further, he is believed to be the mastermind of the Pathankot attack in 2016 and the Pulwama attack in 2019.  According to news reports, the Pakistan government has asked the Taliban to trace and arrest the JeM chief in Afghanistan. He is still far away from being extradited to India.  Meanwhile, Masood Azhar’s elder brother Ibrahim Athar, Zahoor Mistri, Shahid Akhtar Sayed, and Azhar Yusuf — the IC-814 hijackers — were also part of the list sent in 2002. Zahoor Mistri was killed in a shooting in Karachi in March 2022. Masood Azhar attended the funeral of Mistri, according to news reports.  Ibrahim Athar, meanwhile, is also wanted for his role in the Parliament attack in 2001. According to Ministry of Home Affairs documents, as of 2020, a red corner notice was issued against the Pakistani national to bring him to India. The MHA notified Athar as a terrorist under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in 2020.  Azhar Yusuf was believed to be heading the JeM’s Balakot camp that was targeted by the Indian Air Force (IAF) in February 2019. Reports suggest that Shahid Akhtar Sayed has shifted from Karachi to the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province in search of a safe harbour.  A former engineer-turned-fanatic preacher and co-founder of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Hafiz Mohammed Saeed is known to be the mastermind behind the 26/11 attacks in Mumbai. Originally, he was known to operate from Muridke town, near Lahore in Pakistan.  In 2020, under pressure from the US and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a Pakistan anti-terrorism court convicted Saeed on terrorism-related charges and sentenced him to five and a half years in prison.  One year on, Pakistan accused India of carrying out a bomb blast near Saeed’s house in Lahore. Consequently, the three accused were sentenced to life imprisonment.  However, Saeed is still far away from an Indian prison.  Absconding since 1993, Hizbul Mujahideen chief Syed Salahuddin is reportedly operating from Pakistan. In 2020, India designated him as a terrorist. In April, two properties owned by his sons were attached in a terror-related investigation by the National Investigation Agency (NIA). Hizbul Mujahideen had taken responsibility for several attacks on security forces in J&K.  Also Read: LTTE, JeM, ULFA – List of 42 terror outfits banned by MHA before Popular Front of India    D-Company & associates  Underworld Dawood Ibrahim — the man behind the planning and financing of 13 explosions in Mumbai in 1993 that claimed almost 300 lives — is wanted in connection with cases of arms supply, counterfeiting, drugs trade, funding alleged criminals, murder and smuggling. He reportedly lives in and operates from Karachi, Pakistan.  A key associate of Dawood, Chhota Shakeel is wanted for murders, extortions, kidnappings, and blackmailing of businessmen and film stars in India.  Accused of executing the Mumbai blasts, ‘Tiger’ Ibrahim Memon is also wanted in several cases of murder, extortion, kidnap, terrorism and smuggling arms and explosives in India.  Apart from being wanted in cases of terrorism and smuggling, Ayub Memon is accused of helping his brother Tiger Memon carry out the Mumbai blasts.  Further, Mumbai blast convict Yakub Memon — the brother of Tiger and Ayub — was hanged in a Nagpur jail in 2015.  Two more Dawood associates Ishaaq Atta Hussain and Sagir Sabir Ali Shaikh also feature on the list for their role in a conspiracy to kill former deputy prime minister L.K. Advani. Reports suggest that they are operating from Karachi.  Khalistan exponents & others  The list also mentioned the founders of Khalistani outfits, including Wadhawa Singh Babbar, Lakhbir Singh Rode, and Gajinder Singh.  Wadhawa heads the Babbar Khalsa International, which was designated as a terrorist outfit by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) in 2020.  During the decades-long insurgency in Punjab in the 1970s and 1980s, the outfit took part in several killings and assassinations. He is also wanted for the assassination of former Punjab chief minister Beant Singh in 1995.  According to the South Asia Terrorism Portal, Wadhawa is still operating from Pakistan.  Rode, a relative of militant leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, heads the pro-Khalistan International Sikh Youth Federation. He is wanted in cases of arms smuggling, conspiracy to attack government leaders in Delhi, and inciting religious hatred in Punjab.  Rode is also said to have links with radical preacher Amritpal Singh, who was arrested in April after a month-long chase. He is allegedly based in Lahore.  Head of the pro-Khalistan outfit Dal Khalsa, Gajinder Singh was sentenced in Pakistan for hijacking an Indian Airlines plane to Lahore in 1981. Later, he was released from jail in 1994.  According to a report in The Tribune, in 2022, he posted a photo on his Facebook page that shows him standing in front of Gurdwara Panja Sahib at Hasan Abdal in Pakistan’s Punjab.  Khalistan Zindabad Force chief Ranjit Singh ‘Neeta’ is also on the list. He faces at least 11 terrorism cases in India. Further, ‘Neeta’ is among the accused in the 1996 bombing of the Jhelum Express, as well as attacks on buses in 1997, the blasts on Sealdah and Pooja express trains in 2000, and the explosion at Jalandhar bus station in April 2006.  Like Rode, Neeta is said to be based in Lahore.  The last in the list is Delhi-born Abdul Karim alias Tunda who is blamed for more than 30 bomb blasts in New Delhi and parts of northern India in 1996-97. He was on the run for over a decade, including in Pakistan, before he was arrested near the India-Nepal border  in 2013.  In February 2023, a court acquitted him in the 1997 Rohtak twin blasts. He, however, remains in jail for his role in a bomb blast in Sonipat in 1996.  (Edited by Tony Rai)  Also Read: Pakistan is imploding.

"assassination","2023-04-06","Not Discerned","{""Tennessee"", ""Illinois"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 16:09:26","Mississippi legislators have enacted a law that would create a new judicial system covering the state’s capital city, Jackson, in place of the current county court system.  Set to take effect July 1, 2023, opponents have criticized the Republican-dominated legislature’s move as creating a “separate and unequal” court system that is not answerable to the majority-Black community it would seek to govern.  Supporters justified the law as an effort to curb the city’s crime level, which includes one of the highest murder rates in the nation. But the move is the second time in as many months that state legislatures have taken highly visible actions to effectively disenfranchise Black voters: On April 6, the Tennessee House of Representatives expelled two Black members who represented mostly Black districts.  As a sociologist who studies race and ethnicity, I have closely followed how states move. Throughout U.S. history, I see three main periods of legislative disenfranchisement in which legislative bodies have voted to expel members. These events have been shown to be a form of “white backlash” working to keep Black officeholders out of power and their constituents powerless without representation.  Reconstruction and Legislative Disenfranchisement  After the Civil War, the United States engaged in a brief period known as Reconstruction, which lasted from 1865 to 1877. It was a deliberate attempt to reverse the negative effects and legacies of slavery by enacting economic, political and social policies that directly benefited the formerly enslaved Black people of the South.  The efforts included formally abolishing slavery nationwide, guaranteeing equal protection of the laws to everyone regardless of race, and allowing formerly enslaved people to vote. In addition, formerly Confederate land was set aside for newly freed Black families, and former Confederate soldiers were not allowed to vote.  But after Tennessee politician Andrew Johnson, who had been Abraham Lincoln’s running mate in 1864, took office upon Lincoln’s assassination, many of those provisions of Reconstruction were reversed. Former Confederate combatants were allowed to vote, and confiscated Confederate property was returned to its prewar owners.  In addition, Johnson and Congress made it easier for defeated Confederate states to rejoin the Union, which allowed former Confederate leaders to regain their previous positions of power in local and national governments.  Georgia was originally readmitted to the Union in July 1868. But just two months later, in September, the Democratically controlled Georgia Assembly, with a total of 196 members, voted to expel all 33 of its Black elected officials.  Immediately upon making themselves into an all-white legislature, the remaining assembly members enacted the infamous Black Codes. These codes created a unique set of laws specific to the newly freed Blacks, including limiting the types of work they could do.  Collectively, the legislative expulsion of the Black officials and the imposition of the Black Codes served to effectively disenfranchise the Black voters of Georgia. Senator Henry McNeal Turner, one of those expelled, defiantly asked: “Am I a man? If I am such, I claim the rights of a man.”  The Civil Rights Era  Another major effort to disenfranchise Black Americans came during their next major push to achieve political, social and economic equality: the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s. Opponents targeted two prominent civil rights activists who had been elected to represent their communities: Adam Clayton Powell Jr. and Julian Bond.  Bond was elected as a Democrat to the Georgia House of Representatives in 1965, but on Jan. 10, 1966, the Democratically controlled House voted not to seat him, citing his criticism of U.S. involvement in Vietnam and support of students who were protesting the war. A year later, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Bond’s First Amendment rights had been violated and ordered that he be seated. But for that intervening year, his constituents had no voice in their state legislature. Bond ultimately served in the Georgia legislature for another two decades, before turning to teaching and activism.  Powell’s situation was different. He was the first African American to be elected to Congress from New York and from any state in the Northeast. Starting in 1945, he represented the district that included the majority-Black Harlem neighborhood of New York City. He became one of the most important Democrats in the House, but in the mid-1960s, he found himself embroiled in personal and financial scandals.  After the election of 1966, the House created a committee to investigate Powell’s actions and refused to seat him until the committee’s report was complete. The report found fault, but committee members were split on the proper discipline for Powell. Ultimately the whole House voted to keep him out.  Powell sued to reclaim his seat, saying the House had excluded him unconstitutionally. He also won the special election in April 1967 created by the vacancy but didn’t take his seat because of the lawsuit. The removal of Powell meant that Harlem was the only congressional district in the nation without a representative from 1967 to 1969.  In 1969, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the House had acted unconstitutionally by refusing to seat Powell. By then, Powell had also won the 1968 regularly scheduled election and had been seated, though without the seniority and committee positions that would normally have been given to someone who had continuously been a House member.  Black Lives Matter Movement  In the aftermath of the George Floyd killing, a new social movement emerged across the United States. With this new activism came another “white backlash” in the form of legislative disenfranchisement.  In May 2022, Tiara Young Hudson, a long-serving Black public defender, won the Democratic primary for a judgeship in Jefferson County, Alabama. More than half of the county’s population is nonwhite. Facing no opposition in the general election, she was expected to win and take office.  But two weeks after the primary, a state judicial commission, divided along racial lines, eliminated the position she was a candidate for and created a new judgeship in the majority-white Madison County.  Hudson immediately sued to block the shift, saying it violated the Alabama Constitution and only the state legislature had the authority to reallocate judgeships. In March 2023, the state supreme court dismissed Hudson’s complaint, effectively stripping the Black people of Jefferson County of a representative they had elected to be their voice on the state’s roster of judges.  And on April 6, 2023, the Republican majority of the Tennessee House of Representatives voted to expel two Black legislators—Justin Pearson and Justin Jones—for participating in a protest calling for gun legislation following yet another mass shooting.  Within days, processes for filling vacant seats temporarily reinstated both Pearson and Jones , but they still face special elections to fully reclaim their seats. Their alleged violation was participating in a protest against the legislature’s rules—but their real violation, I believe, was that they were Black, outspoken and pushed for change.

Gelendzhik Palace has its own church, casino, fully-equipped gym, ice hockey rink and ‘entertainment room’ – complete with stripper poles.  The sprawling 190,000-square-foot complex is sealed off from the rest of Russia by 17,000 acres of woodland guarded by the FSB security services as well as special no-fly and no-boat zones.  But just when you thought the designers had ticked every box, they appear to have neglected one very big one – hide the plans showing the secret tunnels underneath.  The schematics were posted online a decade ago and remained accessible until 2016, having been originally published by contractors Metro Style to showcase their work.  They reveal an underground complex consisting of two separate blast-proof tunnels connected by an elevator which descends roughly 50 metres below the surface.  Vladimir Putin chairs a cabinet meeting via videoconference at Kremlin in Moscow (Picture: AP)  The plans reveal two tunnels roughly 50m underground  They show three tunnel entrances  According to the plans, each is encased in thick concrete and supplied with plenty of fresh water, ventilation and cables  Experts believe the plans are 'intended for someone to survive or escape'  According to the plans, each is encased in thick concrete and supplied with plenty of fresh water, ventilation and cables to support VIPs for up to weeks at a time.  Structural engineer Thaddeus Gabryszewski said they have ‘all kinds of safety and security’, suggesting they are ‘intended for someone to survive or escape’.  The precautions may be more than paranoia on Putin’s part – earlier this month Russia claimed he had been targeted in an attempted assassination following an alleged drone attack on the Kremlin.  Michael C Kimmage, a former US State Department official and Cold War expert, told Insider: ‘Putin has a lot of anxiety about being the not-entirely-legitimate leader of Russia.  ‘So knowing that his legitimacy is not entirely secured by elections, he is going to seek to maximize his personal safety through a complex of well-defended personal residences.""  The plans, which were uncovered by jailed Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation, show the tunnels measure approximately 40 and 60 meters long, respectively, and six metres wide - creating more than 6,000 sq ft of potential living space  The complex is surrounded by acres of guarded woodland (Picture: FBK)  A hatch visible in drone footage (Picture: FBK)  They dubbed one the ‘tasting room’ amid reports it contains full living quarters where Putin and his cronies could take in the views while remaining safe.  It stated: ‘It is a huge window that offers the best possible sea view.  ‘Here you can enjoy a glass of wine... this is not some kind of balcony where you are constantly in danger, but a very safe underground place where nothing threatens you.’  The second passageway is thought to be the preferred mode of escape, leading to a hatch on the coastline visible in drone footage captured by the group.  Mr Kimmage told Insider the location of the bunker – some 1,000 miles away from Moscow – suggests Putin is not merely intending on constructing a plush getaway, but a bolthole.  He said: ‘The two times there has been a big transition in Russian history — 1917 and 1991 — the status of the capital city and the leader's position there has been a big issue.  ‘Putin is solving for that contingency by establishing a network of residences that are as far from the centre as possible. So a tunnel system within the Black Sea complex makes a lot of sense.  ‘Even without an active threat, he's going to be worrying about this eventuality.’  Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.

"assassination","2023-05-15","Not Discerned","{""Jerusalem"", ""Jerusalem"", ""Israel""}","Thu 18 May 2023 18:09:00","The U.S. State Department condemned what it called ""outrageous and unacceptable"" violence and racist behavior at the annual Jerusalem Day Flag March on Thursday.  ""We continue to urge all parties to exercise restraint and to refrain from provocative actions or rhetoric that inflames tensions. This certainly includes racist statements and actions, as well as violence,"" the statement said. ""We unequivocally condemn racist language of any form. Hateful chants such as 'Death to Arabs' are outrageous and unacceptable.""  Tens of thousands of people participated in the Flag March, a contentious event in which right-wing Jewish youth parade with Israeli flags through the Old City, including the Muslim Quarter.  Before the march reached Jerusalem's Old City, clashes erupted between Jewish marchers and Palestinian residents. In one incident, verbal insults hurled by Jewish participants turned into pushing and physical assault against the Palestinians. One resident was knocked to the ground and briefly beaten; law enforcement intervened and dispersed the Palestinians involved.  Participants in the march also attacked journalists in the Old City, wounding three, including Haaretz correspondent Deiaa Haj Yahia. All were lightly wounded, received medical treatment at the scene and continued to work. Police removed the assailants from the area, and later arrested two suspects in the attack, one of them a minor, who was in possession of a knife.  In addition, photographers and correspondents reported several attacks by police on journalists. In one case, Haaretz photographer Emil Salman was attacked by a police officer while carrying out his work.  Salman said that while protesters were being cleared from Jerusalem's Tunnels Road, he was removed from the area and shoved by one of the officers. He was released shortly after. Police claimed that Salman refused to show his identification, but Salman stated that he was not given the option of doing so while being pushed by the officers.  In another instance, an officer pushed CNN correspondent Ben Wedeman, whose arm was injured as a result. At the Damascus Gate in the Old City, an officer grabbed the neck of photojournalist Kobi Wolf.  Some of the march's participants shouted racist and nationalist slogans during the parade, part of which passed through the Muslim Quarter. Hundreds were filmed shouting ""Death to Arabs"" and ""A Jew is a soul, an Arab is the son of a whore"" near the Damascus Gate. Earlier, groups of young Jewish men were filmed dancing and singing ""May your village burn down.""  Despite high tensions and a recent ceasefire with Islamic Jihad and Gaza, the march ended on Thursday night without significant incidents. Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas' political bureau, suggested that Israel's alertness ""proves the fear of the settlers,"" saying that the extensive security measures taken by Israel for the march ""only highlight the perceived weakness of the Zionist entity.""  Meanwhile, Energy Minister Yisrael Katz delivered a speech at the parade in which he threatened Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in Gaza, saying that any attempt to disrupt or harm the march would result in his assassination by Israel, ""just like the fate of his associates in the Islamic Jihad.""  Hundreds of Palestinian demonstrators gathered near the Gaza-Israel border amid calls of Palestinian factions to protest the Jerusalem Flag March. Israeli security forces fired tear gas when the demonstrators approached the border.  Jerusalem Day is celebrated in Israel as the Hebrew anniversary of the country's victory in the 1967 Six-Day War and the reunification of Jerusalem, after the eastern side of the holy city and the West Bank, which had been held by Jordan since 1948, were conquered by Israel.  In 2021, tensions in the city came to a head during Jerusalem Day, which coincided with the final days of Ramadan. That morning, clashes on the Temple Mount compound left more than 300 Palestinians wounded, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent, prompting an Israeli decision to bar Jews from entering the holy site, one of several flashpoints in the city. This culminated in the Flag March, during which Hamas fired rockets at Jerusalem, kicking off a major operation in Gaza and violence in mixed Jewish-Arab cities throughout Israel.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oYWFyZXR6LmNvbS9pc3JhZWwtbmV3cy8yMDIzLTA1LTE4L3R5LWFydGljbGUvLnByZW1pdW0vamVydXNhbGVtLWZsYWctbWFyY2gtZHJhd3MtdGVucy1vZi10aG91c2FuZHMtbWFyY2hlcnMtYXNzYXVsdC1wYWxlc3RpbmlhbnMtam91cm5hbGlzdHMvMDAwMDAxODgtMmZkNC1kOTE0LWFmOGMtYWZmNWI0NzMwMDAw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","0301-04-24","Not Discerned","{""Cappadocia"", ""Abruzzes"", ""Italy""}","Thu 18 May 2023 22:17:15","By Hovsep Daghdigian  Among the saints revered in the Armenian and other Christian churches is Surb (Saint) Hakob, also referred to as Saint Jacob of Nisibis, and Saint James of Mtsbin. This “Saint James” should not to be confused with other Saint James’s. Nisibis, also known as Mtsbin, is a city in southern Turkey near the Syrian border, about 75 km SE of Dikranagerd. Christians of Nisibis, which included many Armenians, traced their Christian origins to Saint Thaddeus who, with Saint Bartholomew, preached and were martyred in Armenia prior to Armenia becoming the first nation to accept Christianity early in the 4th c.  In the 4th c Rome and Persia were contending for power in Armenia and the region. The Persian king sent an Armenian traitor, Anak, to assassinate Armenia’s king Khosrov and his family. Members of the Armenian court, enraged by their King’s assassination, killed Anak and all his family members that they could find. Anak’s son Gregory, however, escaped to Cappadocia where he was educated within its Christian community. Similarly, the murdered Armenian King Khosrov’s son, Drtad, was sent to Rome where he received an education as befitted a future king. Rome later returned Drtad to the Armenian throne. Passing through Cappadocia, Drtad and Gregory met and returned together to Armenia. Gregory converted Drtad, and the Armenian nation, to Christianity in 301 AD, becoming “Gregory the Illuminator”, founder of the Armenian church.  Hakob probably was related to Gregory, either as a cousin or nephew. Some sources indicate he too may have spent some time in Cappadocia. As a youth Hakob abandoned city life, devoting himself to religion, and living an austere existence in the mountains near Nisibis. He became known for his compassion, honesty, sincerity and strong sense of justice. When the bishop of the large Christian community of Nisibis died, the church fathers tried to convince Hakob to take the position, despite his lack of refinement. Numerous attempts to convince him finally succeeded.  Bishop Hakob of Nisibis participated in numerous Christian councils attended as well by representatives of the Armenian church, such as the Council of Nicaea in 325 AD which established the Nicene Creed, to which the Syriac and Armenian church adhered, and which is a fundamental profession of faith in the Armenian church. Byzantine emperor Constantine also attended the council and developed immense respect for Bishop Hakob.  Hakob is reported to have performed many miracles. In one instance a couple of men asked him for a donation to help bury their friend who, faking death, was lying on the ground. Hakob said a prayer, after which the men, checking their friend on the ground, discovered that he was indeed dead. They beseeched Hakob to bring their friend back to life, which he did.  While traveling through a village, Hakob encountered a group of young women washing in a stream. They immodestly refused to cover themselves properly in the presence of a stranger. In response to a prayer by Surb Hakob, the stream dried up and the women’s hair turned white. The villagers urged Hakob to allow the stream to flow again, which he did, but the immodest women’s white hair remained.  Hakob urged a Persian judge to reconsider an unfair judgement which he had issued. The judge refused. When Surb Hakob, with a prayer, turned a stone into dust the judge reversed his decision.  Following the death of Byzantine Emperor Constantine in 337, the Persian Sassanid King Shapur II saw an opportunity to recapture territory Persia had previously lost to Rome. He attacked Roman held territories in upper Mesopotamia, Armenia, and in 338 attacked Nisibis. Hakob mounted Nisibis’ defensive walls and, praying, caused a swarm of insects to attack the large invading army which included war machines and elephants. The insects so irritated the soldiers and elephants that they caused the army to retreat. The Persian general, eyeing the tower upon which Surb Hakob stood, claimed he saw Emperor Constantine, who had previously died, leading the defense. The Persian assault failed.  Troubled by the weakening faith of his people, Surb Hakob desired to find Noah’s “redeeming Ark”. He determined that if he could retrieve and display a piece of the Ark from Mt. Ararat[i], this would bolster his people’s faith.  One variant of Sp. Hakob’s jourrney up Mt. Ararat is described by Pavstos Buzand[ii], a 5th c Armenian historian. Other accounts differ slightly:  As Surb Hakob ascended the parched slope of Mt. Ararat, he with his colleagues grew tired and in need of water. They fell to the ground and prayed. A spring then gushed forth near Hakob’s head. According to Pavstos Buzand, “the spring, called Hakob’s spring, remains to this day”. Proceeding further up Mt. Ararat, near the summit, Hakob grew tired and fell asleep. An angel descended, left a piece of wood from the Ark near his head, and indicated that Hakob must search no further. As he descended the people around Ararat rejoiced at the presence of such a holy man who brought a gift of wood from the Ark. Surb Hakob then proceeded to visit the “great servant of the Armenian king”, Prince Manachir, near Lake Van whom he had heard was a merciless and unjust man. But Hakob hoped to soften Manachir’s heart and install in him fear of God. Instead, Prince Mananchir scorned Surb Hakob, throwing 800 innocent prisoners into the sea. Hakob, with his colleagues grieving for the innocent victims, journeyed to the base of a nearby mountain. Again, he prayed and a spring came forth from the ground. Climbing to the summit of the mountain, he cursed the realm of the prince causing the death of Prince Manachir, his wife, and his seven sons. According to another source, though, one of Manachir’s sons repented and thus survived.  Surb Hakob Monastery, on the NE slope of Mt. Ararat, was built in 341 AD at the place where Hakob received the wood from the Ark. There may have been a church, St. James, in the nearby village of Akori[iii]. The monastery was said to be of a cruciform plan with a central dome. In 1829 Baltic German explorer Friedrich Parrot, with Armenian writer Khachatur Abovian, were the first people known to summit Mt. Ararat. On the way to the summit, they visited Surb Hakob monastery which had engraved inscriptions dating to the 13th and 14th centuries. In the summer of 1840, an earthquake or volcanic explosion destroyed Surb Hakob monastery and the village of Akori. Many of the residents subsequently settled in Kamaris, a town in Kotayk province in the present Republic of Armenian. Currently the small Kurdish village of Yenidogan (“New Village”) is situated on or near the site of Akori. The monastery no longer exists, though there remain remnants of an Armenian cemetery with Armenian tombstones.  A number of Armenian churches and chapels named “Surp Hakob,” or equivalently “St. James of Nisibus” or “Saint James of Mtsbin”, exist. The history of some of these churches remains obscure.  About a mile outside the village of Kolotak, Martakert Province, in Artsakh (Nagorno Karabagh) is Hakobavank, founded in the 5-7th c, which underwent modifications until the 12th c. In the 14th c. the monastery became an important center of the region of Mets Arank, acquiring the name of Metsaranits Monastery. Between the 9th and 18th c the buildings were modified and maintained, with relics of Sp. Hakob kept until the 19th c. The monastery contains two churches, rooms for clergy, and in the Middle Ages was a pilgrimage site for Armenians in Eastern Armenia.  In 2022 a renovation project was initiated to restore a workable place of worship for the villagers, and refugees settling in Kolotak coming from areas of Artsakh now occupied by Azerbaijan. The monastery is also an archaeological and architectural site, with an inscription dating to 853 and medieval water pipes made of clay and wooden branches on the ground. A description of the completed Hakobavank restoration project can be seen on the reArmenia web page at https://rearmenia.com/en/collaborations/lets-restore-the-hakobavank-monastery?tab=updates .  Surb Hakob died either in 338 or 350 and is buried in the Church of Saint Jacob in Nisibis. A fragment of wood from the Ark resides in the museum at Echmiadzin. In the Armenian Apostolic Church, Surb Hakob of Nisibis’ holiday is celebrated on the Saturday between December 12-18.  ————————————————-  [i] Early accounts cite the Ark as having landed on Mt. Qardu, southern Turkey, in a region called “Kordukh” in Armenian.

You’ve probably heard of Botak Chin, Malaysia’s No.1 gangster back in the 70s and 80s. Malaysians nationwide were hooked on the news stories of his brazen crimes. We’ve not seen a more sensationalised gang leader till this day, with many still interested in his tales of notoriety.  This infamous gun loving criminal actually came from very humble beginnings. Here are a few details about Botak Chin’s life that you may not know of.  1.He’s not Botak (Bald)  Botak Chin, also known by his real name, Wong Swee Chin, is actually NOT bald. It’s believed that “Botak” stands for “Bantu Orang Tak Ada Kerja” which translates to “Helping people who are without jobs”.  Other reports say that Botak is a combination of three Hokkien words which are “Bo Tak Chin” which means “No (Bo), Work (Tak) Chin (Cina)” or “Cina Tiada Kerja” in Malay or “jobless Chinese”.  We’ll leave this theory for the Hokkien speakers to discuss in the comments!  2. He had 10 siblings  On March 3rd, 1951, Chin was born into a big family. He had 10 siblings and a father who worked for the Malayan Railways.  He attended Methodist Boys’ Secondary School in Sentul after receiving his education at a Chinese Vernacular Primary School. However, his education was cut short at the age of 15 when he quit school to work as a fishmonger.  It is believed that this was the period in which his mother passed away, leading him to spend even more time away from home.  Through his delinquent friends who he often did petty crime with, Chin joined a Malaysian Chinese Triad group called 360 (Sam Pak Lok) where he was impressed by the group’s collection of firearms.  3. He loved guns  Botak Chin was most famous for his guns. His power hunger for guns eventually built up a personal collection of 19 firearms, 5 grenades and 1000 bullets. Botak Chin loved showing off his weapons every chance he got. He would swagger about the Sentul market, openly showing off his guns to everyone.  While Chin did not bring harm to any children or civilians during his crime sprees, he did kill a number of security guards and police officers.  An abandoned tin mine in Sentul was the gang’s hideout, where they would practise their gun shooting on stray dogs roaming around.  4. Imprisoned for 5 years before he was freed  Botak Chin was known to go on a spree of armed robberies, even 8 in a month. After one spree near Kuala Lumpur City in 1969, Botak Chin was arrested for the first time and sentenced to seven years in jail. He was released after five for good behavior.  However, jail time did not deter him from crime. In fact, immediately after his release in 1975, he and his gang managed to purchase a new set of firearms and ammunition from a gun runner in Thailand.  5. He needed a special squad of cops to pursue him  A squad, called the Magnificent 12, was led by Deputy Superintendent (DSP) S. Kulasingam to specifically hunt down Botak Chin.  In their pursuit, the Magnificent 12 managed to gun down seven of the gang members, though they didn’t get Botak Chin himself. Enraged, Chin plotted his revenge and orchestrated an assassination attempt on Kulasingam, who thankfully escaped with minor injuries.  6. Survived 6 gunshots before he was hanged  Kulasingam finally got the final showdown he sought for when the squad ambushed the gang in Eng Leong sawmill on Jalan Ipoh.  A fierce firefight ensued which saw several more gang members killed and, in the chaos, Chin was wounded with 6 gunshots (but survived) and was then arrested.  He faced multiple criminal charges with his illegal possession of firearms, killing a number of security guards and policemen, earning him the death sentence.  While he was held in Pudu Jail, he attempted to escape but failed 3 TIMES and eventually was hanged in 1981.  7. Called himself Robin Hood of Malaysia  Despite being a pain to the police force, members of the public did sympathise with the gang leader. Some even compared him to the legendary Robin Hood.  Stories have been told of Chin giving away the proceeds of his crimes to the needy, with one tale relating how he gave an elderly ice-cream seller hundreds of ringgit out of his own pocket.  He is also said to have some level of moral standards, abstaining from targeting poor folks as well as never putting children in harm’s way.  Others did point out that these supposed acts of kindness could have just been his way of keeping possible witnesses against him quiet.  So there you have it, a brief snippet into Malaysia’s No.1 gangster in the 70s-80s. Of course it’s clear that Chin was an ambitious daredevil criminal but we just can’t help but be curious about his life.  Do know of any other infamous gang leaders we should cover? Let us know in the comments.

"assassination","1983-08-21","Not Discerned","{""Ninoy"", ""Pangasinan"", ""Philippines""}","Fri 19 May 2023 06:21:38","It’s bad enough that the 'golden age' myths are being perpetuated by vloggers and trolls, but way worse when done by other economists  On Monday, May 15, 2023, the Philippine Center for Economic Development (PCED) – a government agency in support of the UP School of Economics – kicked off a series of lectures to commemorate its 50th anniversary this year.  The speakers are all past directors-general of the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), and the talks are scheduled every month of 2023, from May to November.  The inaugural talk on May 15 was made by Dr. Gerardo Sicat, 87, the top economist of the dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos. In 1970, Sicat served as chair of the National Economic Council, and then became the first director-general of NEDA in 1973. These institutions were designed to undertake national planning toward socioeconomic development.  Sicat’s inaugural lecture on May 15 was quite fitting. He left his mark in the economics profession of the country by establishing a number of institutions, including PCED itself, as well as the Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS), the government’s think tank.  He gave a lecture reminiscing about his time in government during the Marcos dictatorship. It was natural to expect him to wax nostalgic. But some claims he made – along with former prime minister Cesar Virata, 92, who was in attendance and in fact one of Sicat’s discussants – unfortunately whitewashed certain aspects of the economy during that time.  The Sicat ‘bump’  For instance, Sicat presented a graph showing the upward trend of national output (measured by GDP or gross domestic product) over time.  He then pointed out that if you run a line across this trend, there was supposedly a “bump above the long-term trend of growth” during his time in office. He added, GDP “for a while it was up there, and then suddenly it drops, and then…for a long time it drops below the long-term trend…”  In short, the economy supposedly grew more rapidly around the time he was in office, and then underperformed starting the Corazon Aquino administration.  This was improper use of statistics and graphs.  Figure 1.  First, running a line across those data points is ill-advised because of a distinct “structural break” in the series around 1984 and 1985, when the Philippine economy suffered its worst postwar recession or downturn in the dying years of Martial Law. (You can read all about that in my book titled, False Nostalgia: The Marcos “Golden Age” Myths and How to Debunk Them.)  The presence of such break in the series would naturally make it appear that GDP was above-average in the 1970s, and below-average in the 1990s onward. Simply, you don’t just connect two separate trends using one trendline. If you implement the proper statistical corrections (which a colleague of mine at UPSE explored recently), such a big bump during Sicat’s time would all but disappear.  ‘Ninoy shock’  Sicat also showed another graph showing the growth of GDP over time, but this time labeled the steep decline starting 1983 as the “Ninoy shock,” referring of course to the August 21, 1983, assassination of the former senator.  He then showed alternative scenarios of how GDP would’ve grown had the “Ninoy shock” not happened. He said, “In the year 2000, if the growth path were lower, we would’ve achieved a real GDP…that was equivalent to the real GDP that the country had obtained in the year 2008. So that’s eight years lost in our growth. If it happened that there was a higher growth path, it would’ve been 10 years.”  Figure 2.  Right after presenting this, Sicat became defensive: “Now I’m not posing any judgmental issue here…” He added that he deliberately chose not to focus on it for his talk, because he would “get into trouble” and “so many issues” in the graph may be raised. “I won’t even answer questions if you ask me, what about this and that,” he said.  Here are some of those issues Sicat tried to avoid.  First, there was no explanation how projections he called “low growth path” and “high growth path” were obtained. Also, the lines and points in the graph are unaligned and seem arbitrary.  Second, when speaking about development, economists typically look at GDP per person, not GDP itself. And data show that after dipping in 1982 (even before Ninoy was killed), GDP per person in the country fell and didn’t recover until 2003. That’s 21 years called now the “lost decades of development” – far longer than the eight or 10 years that Sicat showed and attributed to the “Ninoy shock.”  Third, and most importantly, it’s unfair to label the dip in GDP as “Ninoy shock” when in fact the economy was worsening way before Ninoy came back to the country. The seeds of the crisis were planted as early as the mid-1970s. Using such a label conceals the fact that it was the Marcos government that was ultimately responsible for the economic crisis.  Sicat later added that the Ninoy shock “broke the nation’s back,” because after that, “international conference on the Philippine sovereign debt fell apart,” our creditors stopped lending, and we became “alone in the world.”  This is another gross mischaracterization of what had happened. Creditors stopped lending when, in late 1983, after Ninoy’s assassination, the Marcos government declared a debt moratorium. Essentially, the Marcos government said to the world we could no longer pay our debts. That stemmed from the profligate spending and irresponsible debt accumulation of the regime.  Sicat did mention in passing there was “looming” debt, but brushed it aside by citing the experiences of debt-ridden countries like Mexico whose debt crises “passed.”  This is the wrong comparison to make. As Professor Emeritus Emmanuel de Dios wrote back in 2015, “It is instructive that neither Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, nor any major Asian country catastrophically experienced negative growth in the early 1980s. The Philippines was the exception…. This suggests that there was nothing unavoidable about the crisis the Philippines suffered, and that it was the result instead of failed policies.”  Using his framing, Sicat downplayed the repercussions of the Marcosian debt crisis which depleted our international reserves, led to the debt moratorium, and fixed with necessary stabilization measures that ignited a full-blown economic crisis.  Sicat also put too much emphasis on the economic shocks in the 1970s and 1980s, like the oil price shocks due to OPEC [Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries] and the interest rate shock due to the steep rise of interest rates in the US in the early 1980s (Figure 3). He also lumped together the interest rate shock and the “Ninoy shock,” and pointed out that because of these GDP growth even became negative.  This is plainly wrong. GDP dropped by more than 7% not in 1983, but in 1984, then again in 1985. Also, in explaining the recession, there was no mention of the profligate spending and borrowing of the dictatorship, which, more than anything else, eventually brought the nation to its knees.  Figure 3.  Sicat went on by showing another graph of inflation, and here the “biggest shock was the combination of the interest rate shock plus the Ninoy shock.”  Again, this is wrong. Inflation shot up to more than 50% in 1984 largely because of the severe depreciation of the peso due to the conditionalities set by the International Monetary Fund in stabilizing the damaged Marcosian economy.  In the first place, if the technocrats had not allowed the economy to be so mismanaged and debt-ridden, we need not have declared a debt moratorium and we wouldn’t have to be “stabilized” by the IMF.  Figure 4.  For his part, former prime minister Cesar Virata claimed in the Q&A that Philippine debt ballooned because the banks wanted to give us big loans rather than small loans.  He said, “The problem during that time was that the Western banks…would not like to lend small things, they always want to lend big things with the guarantee of the government.” Also, he said the Western banks conspired to bring down the Marcos regime.  Oh, what spin!  Other Martial Law myths  Sicat made other claims about various aspects of Martial Law that also need to be given proper context or outright corrected.  First, he said near the beginning of his lecture that Martial Law was declared because Marcos “discovered, in his own analysis, that the country was in danger and decided Martial Law was the solution.”  But espousing this view only perpetrates Marcos’ dubious justifications for Martial Law. It also masks the truth that Marcos did it primarily to overextend his stay in power.  Second, Sicat proudly listed down a long list of infrastructure projects built during the regime. He even claimed that on a per-year basis, adjusting for the regime’s 21 years, Marcos would probably still be “the best” when it comes to infrastructure.  But he omitted mentioning that many of those infrastructure projects were extravagant, needless, and largely used as vehicles for corruption.  He did mention in passing the notorious white elephant, the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant: “Unfortunately, this…was not put to use by the successor government for political reasons.” No mention of the myriad problems that went into its construction. No mention of the multimillion-dollar commissions earned by Herminio Disini, the crony broker, and ex-president Marcos himself.  Sicat also mentioned the “protected industries” that were “highly indebted to state financial enterprises,” and which he “criticized in [his] academic work.” But he didn’t say that many of the protections and advantages were coming from the dictator himself, and those firms obtained money from the Marcos government at the behest of the former president himself (hence, the term “behest loans”).  In the latter part of his talk, Sicat also bemoaned the OFW phenomenon, saying that we don’t want a situation where our national income (taking into account OFWs’ earnings) is always ahead of GDP. Instead, we want to attract foreign capital and promote domestic economic activity and job creation.  But again he neglected to say that the labor exportation policy was a deliberate policy of the Marcos regime, and in fact people were encouraged to work abroad so that the remittances they sent back to their families could be used to replenish our depleting stocks of dollars – depleting precisely because of the ballooning debt of the regime, among other things.  Whitewashing galore  Sicat did not always see eye-to-eye with Marcos, most notably on the continued protection of domestic industries from international competition. Sicat’s push for liberalization was thwarted by strong lobby by industrialists, many of whom were Marcos cronies. Maybe that’s one reason why he exited the regime in 1980, well ahead of the economic crisis.  But more than 50 years since Martial Law was declared, it’s unfortunate that Marcos’ technocrats are still trying to justify or defend the dictatorship. They are still making it appear that the economy back then was stellar and that many things got worse when Marcos was ousted by the People Power Revolution.  It’s bad enough that the “golden age” myths are being perpetuated by vloggers and trolls, but way worse when done by other economists. – Rappler.com  JC Punongbayan, PhD is an assistant professor at the UP School of Economics and the author of False Nostalgia: The Marcos “Golden Age” Myths and How to Debunk Them.

But suspects should not be tortured, the president asserts.  ""Imran Khan did not oppose new army chief's appointment.""  Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan should openly condemn the May 9 events, President Arif Alvi said Thursday, in which public properties and military installations were attacked.  In an interview on Geo News' programme ""Capital Talk"", the president — a close aide of the PTI chief — called for taking action against the miscreants involved in the events.  The PTI leadership — including the party chairman — have condemned the attacks in which the General Headquarters, Rawalpindi, was also targeted and called for a Supreme Court-led probe into the events.  The violent protests were triggered after Khan's arrest in the Al-Qadir Trust case which led to the deaths of at least 10 people and injured several others, prompting the authorities to arrest thousands of PTI workers.  After the supporters attacked army installations, the army said that May 9, 2023 — the day when chaos gripped the nation following Khan's arrest — would go down in history as a ""dark chapter"".  The military and the government alike have vowed to try the vandals who attacked army installations under the Pakistan Army Act, Official Secrets Act, and other laws.  Human rights organisations and some in the government have opposed trying civilians under the army act, but agreed that the vandals should be tried and ""due process"" be followed.  The president, in the interview, also added that during the trials, the suspects' human rights should be respected and they shouldn't be tortured.  ""The people involved should be punished in line with the law,"" he said.  'No issues on COAS appointment'  The president added that the PTI chairman did not oppose Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir.  ""Imran Khan asked me to tell General Bajwa that he should accept anyone whom the institution approves as the next chief,"" President Alvi said.  Khan has criticised the military's incumbent leadership and blamed a senior armed forces official for his alleged involvement in the November 3, 2022, assassination attempt.  But at the same time, the PTI chief has also said that he will not interfere with the institution's matters when he comes back to power.  ""I do not intervene in the institution's matters. I've repeatedly said this,"" he said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdlby50di9sYXRlc3QvNDg4MDk5LWltcmFuLWtoYW4tc2hvdWxkLW9wZW5seS1jb25kZW1uLW1heS05LWV2ZW50cy1wcmVzaWRlbnQtYXJpZi1hbHZp0gFfaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2VvLnR2L2FtcC80ODgwOTktaW1yYW4ta2hhbi1zaG91bGQtb3Blbmx5LWNvbmRlbW4tbWF5LTktZXZlbnRzLXByZXNpZGVudC1hcmlmLWFsdmk?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2023-05-18","22:00:00","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 20:21:22","By AFP - May 18,2023 - Last updated at May 18,2023  People take part in a rally to show solidarity with Pakistan's army in Peshawar on Wednesday, after military installations were allegedly damaged by supporters of former Pakistan's prime minister Imran Khan following his arrest last week (AFP file photo)  ISLAMABAD — Former prime minister Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party accused intelligence agencies on Tuesday of being responsible for shootings and arson during violent protests that followed his arrest last week.  The former cricket superstar has waged a campaign of defiance against Pakistan's powerful military, which controls the country's intelligence services, since being ousted from power last year.  Khan, 70, is Pakistan's most popular politician and his arrest on corruption charges last week, following months of political crisis, prompted his supporters to pour onto the streets of several cities.  Violent clashes erupted with police, government buildings were set on fire and military installations damaged, with at least nine people killed in the unrest.  Open criticism of the military, which has staged three coups and heavily influences domestic politics and foreign policy, is rare in Pakistan's political mainstream.  ""We have ample amount of evidence to present to any inquiry that the arson and in some places, shootings were done by (intelligence) agencies men who wanted to cause mayhem and blame it on PTI so the current crackdown would be justified,"" the party said in a statement.  ""PTI believes that identification of elements involved in this unusual incident of violence and chaos through a credible investigation is inevitable,"" the statement said.  It did not offer any evidence for the claim.  More than 7,000 people have been detained or arrested since the unrest broke out.  At least 19 senior PTI officials have been arrested, some in overnight raids on their homes, after being accused of instigating the violence.  The PTI statement came a day after top commanders vowed to try those involved in damaging military installations in military courts.  Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, whose government has vowed to rearrest Khan, said he would open more anti-terrorism courts to try people accused of anti-state behaviour during the protests.  The independent Human Rights Commission Pakistan said it was “deeply concerned by reports of random arrests and cases filed arbitrarily against PTI workers across Pakistan”.  “A distinction must always be made between those resorting to violence and non-violent political workers,” it said in a statement this week.  Khan’s arrest was declared unlawful by the Supreme Court’s chief justice and he was later released and granted protective bail.  He has been tied up in dozens of legal cases since being ousted in April 2022, a frequent hazard for opposition leaders in Pakistan.  Elections are due no later than October and Khan has held a series of huge rallies challenging the authority of the shaky coalition of parties that replaced him.  When Khan surged into office in 2018, many analysts and politicians said it was with the backing of the generals.  Analysts likewise said when he left power it was because he had fallen out of favour with the top brass over foreign policy and other issues.  In opposition, Khan has made explosive claims about the military’s involvement in politics, including that it plotted with the United States to oust him from power and that senior officials planned a November assassination attempt in which he was shot in the leg while campaigning for fresh polls.  He has offered no evidence to support his claims but named a senior intelligence services general and Sharif as being responsible for the attack.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHA6Ly93d3cuam9yZGFudGltZXMuY29tL25ld3Mvd29ybGQvZXgtcGFraXN0YW4tcG0ta2hhbnMtcGFydHktYmxhbWVzLWludGVsbGlnZW5jZS1hZ2VuY2llcy12aW9sZW5jZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2022-12-26","Not Discerned","{""Lasanod"", ""Nugal"", ""Somalia""}","Fri 19 May 2023 03:24:06","The Somaliland army and militias associated with the Dhulbahante people have been fighting for control of Las Anod, capital of Somaliland’s Sool region, since February. The conflict began after the Dhulbahante said they wish to join Somalia rather than be governed any longer by Somaliland, which declared its independence in 1991. As leaders on both sides double down on warlike rhetoric and recruit new fighters, the violence could spread throughout Sool, putting Somaliland’s hard-earned stability at risk. The belligerents should commit to an immediate ceasefire to allow delivery of humanitarian aid. Once they reach a truce, they should prepare for talks about Sool’s future administrative status. To ensure that both sides have credible representatives at the table, the Dhulbahante should appoint an inclusive leadership team for these negotiations, and Somaliland should hold its overdue presidential election to restore local legitimacy to its governing elite. In 1991, Somaliland proclaimed independence from Somalia after years of rebellion led by the Isaaq clan, which continues to dominate the country’s politics. It based its claim to statehood largely on the argument that its history as a British protectorate set it apart from the rest of Somalia, which was under Italian colonial rule until the two territories merged into one in 1960. The colonial-era borders, which placed Sool on Somaliland’s side of the line, remain central to Somalilander identity. But the majority of Sool’s population is Dhulbahante, a people who belong to a non-Isaaq clan family, the Darod. They strongly resisted British colonialism and generally fared better than the Isaaq under Somali dictator Siad Barre, who ruled from 1969 to 1991, leading most of them to favour the idea of being governed by Somalia. They largely reject inclusion in Somaliland’s state-building project, which they view as serving the Isaaq clan’s interests. Uneasy with the Isaaq clan’s ascendancy in Somaliland, the Dhulbahante have long searched for an alternative administrative arrangement, such as joining Somalia’s federal member state of Puntland, where their family ties through the Darod/Harti clan are deeper, or creating their own separate member state within Somalia. Not all Dhulbahante have the same vision for the future, but many want to break with Somaliland.  Authorities in Somaliland’s capital Hargeisa have long struggled to stamp their authority in Sool.  As a result, authorities in Somaliland’s capital Hargeisa have long struggled to stamp their authority in Sool. Somaliland forces took control of Las Anod only in 2007, after troops from neighbouring Puntland – who had moved in four years earlier to claim the area – withdrew following a local dispute. Since then, Hargeisa has taken steps to placate the Dhulbahante, including offering posts in regional and national government to community elites and promising to devote 2 per cent of Somaliland’s budget to developing Sool and the neighbouring Sanaag region. But it has also missed opportunities to improve relations, feeding Dhulbahante perceptions of exclusion. President Muse Bihi refused, for example, to honour a power-sharing agreement that his predecessor Ahmed Mohamed Mohamoud “Silanyo” made with prominent Dhulbahante politician Ali Khalif Galaydh in 2017. Dhulbahante leaders also allege that the government’s efforts to develop their region have been lacklustre, bearing little fruit. Against this backdrop, a Somaliland opposition member from the Dhulbahante was assassinated on 26 December 2022 in Las Anod, setting in motion the events that led to the fighting. Unexplained killings of Las Anod’s civic leaders are all too frequent: residents estimate that gunmen have shot some 120 prominent members of the community dead over the past thirteen years. Protesters gathered in town after the December assassination, complaining that the Somaliland authorities’ efforts to stop the killings have been inadequate. Police moved in to disperse the demonstrators, using excessive force. The protests then rapidly grew into an uprising, prompting Hargeisa to pull its security forces from large sections of the town on 5 January. This partial retreat was the catalyst for the Dhulbahante to cement resistance to Hargeisa’s rule. They nominated a 33-strong committee to represent the community, while Dhulbahante garaads (or elders), many of whom had left when Somaliland troops marched into Las Anod in 2007, poured back into town (to its credit, the Somaliland government did little to prevent their return). In early February, the Dhulbahante organised a conference to discuss their future, including representatives from the smaller Hawiye/Fiqishine clan. Then, on 5 February, they declared that the Dhulbahante and the areas where they live fall under Somalia’s writ. They called on Somaliland to withdraw its troops from Dhulbahante territory. As the conference drew to a close, Somaliland security forces and Dhulbahante militias came to blows, with each side subsequently blaming the other for starting the skirmishes. Since then, the tug of war over Las Anod has killed over one hundred and displaced at least 150,000. Fighting has raged on the outskirts of the city, which is now under Dhulbahante control, with observers also reporting indiscriminate shelling of houses and other buildings. Though confrontations appear to have slowed in recent weeks, the two sides are reportedly enlisting new fighters and procuring fresh supplies of weapons. More recently, the Dhulbahante committee banned commercial traffic from Somaliland, blocking the main road to Hargeisa and complicating the delivery of humanitarian aid to Sool  Hargeisa shows its disregard for the Dhulbahante’s deep-seated grievances by blaming the conflict on a range of outside actors.  Hargeisa shows its disregard for the Dhulbahante’s deep-seated grievances by blaming the conflict on a range of outside actors, such as Mogadishu and Ethiopia’s Somali region, which lies south of Somaliland. It also accuses Puntland of sending soldiers to the area, a claim that both Puntland and the Dhulbahante deny – although Puntland soldiers on ostensible leaves of absence have reportedly established a non-uniformed presence in Las Anod. Hargeisa has also sought to frame the conflict as driven by the Islamist insurgency Al-Shabaab. Thus far, the allegations of external support seem for the most part to be overblown. The Dhulbahante are indeed receiving money, equipment and fighters, but primarily from allied Darod/Harti clans in Somalia. More substantial backing may be in the offing, however: Puntland President Said Deni recently committed to rapidly “liberating” Las Anod, a rhetorical escalation that could be portentous. Silencing the guns has proven difficult. Hargeisa declared a unilateral ceasefire in the conflict’s early days, but neither side respected it. Elders from Somaliland and Ethiopian government representatives have tried to broker a truce, without success. At the time of writing, clan elders from Somalia were pushing for ceasefire negotiations, but although President Bihi allowed them to visit Hargeisa and meet elders from Somaliland after they travelled to Garowe and Las Anod, they will likely have difficulty forging a truce as elites in Hargeisa may push back against meaningful involvement from Somali actors. The Dhulbahante say they will stop fighting only if Somaliland removes its soldiers from all Dhulbahante-inhabited areas. But while Somaliland had offered to reposition its forces 30km outside Las Anod, it says it will not withdraw from all the territory where the Dhulbahante live. More recently, Somaliland conditioned consideration of a truce on Puntland pulling all forces Hargeisa associates with it from Las Anod. Complicating matters further is the fact that the Dhulbahante are increasingly referring to Somalia’s government as their legitimate representative. Mogadishu has thus far eschewed direct involvement in the crisis, likely because it wants to avoid getting sucked into an intractable conflict at a time when it has scaled up its military operations against Al-Shabaab. There are worrying signs that the fighting might escalate. Local sources tell Crisis Group that both sides are recruiting additional fighters. In recent weeks, both Somaliland security officials and Dhulbahante elders have said they are determined to go on the offensive. In addition to the alarming prospect of further urban warfare in Las Anod, clashes may spread to other Dhulbahante areas in Sool. If the conflict drags on, morphing from a Somaliland-Dhulbahante dispute into a confrontation between the Darod and Isaaq clan families (or even the wider Dir clan family of which the Isaaq form a part), unrest could ripple into other parts of Somaliland or into Ethiopia. Still another concern is Al-Shabaab. Evidence is scant that the insurgency has been involved in Las Anod to date, but prolonged disorder might offer the group an opportunity to insinuate its fighters into the conflict or otherwise exploit the crisis to extend its influence in the region.  Somaliland’s pursuit of international recognition revolves around its efforts to build democratic institutions and secure long-term stability.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyaXNpc2dyb3VwLm9yZy9hZnJpY2EvaG9ybi1hZnJpY2Evc29tYWxpbGFuZC90aW1lLXNvbWFsaWxhbmQtYW5kLWRodWxiYWhhbnRlLXRhbGvSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The resolution also seeks to restore the home where he lived. Malcolm X, pictured speaking to reporters in 1963. AP, File  The Boston City Council unanimously supported a resolution Wednesday that would mark May 19, the birthday of civil rights leader Malcolm X, as a municipal holiday.  The resolution would also designate a site on Malcolm X Boulevard in Roxbury for the creation of a statue honoring him as part of the city’s Black Heritage Trail.  It also seeks to renovate the building where he lived for years. The building is located at 72 Dale St. in Roxbury, across from what is now known as Malcolm X Park. The Malcolm X-Ella Little Collins House is “completely dilapidated,” Councilor Tania Fernandes Anderson said.  Advertisement:  Fernandes Anderson, who sponsored the resolution, spoke during Wednesday’s meeting about her personal admiration for Malcolm X and his significant role in Boston’s cultural history.  “He was a man of great depth, who embodied values of selflessness, of love and patience and passion for humanity,” she said. “His values have had a profound impact on my life, and I look up to him as a symbol of hope for people who have faced discrimination and oppression.”  Malcolm X, born Malcolm Little in Nebraska, moved to Boston in the early 1940s as a teenager. He lived with his older sister Ella Collins, and the building at 72 Dale St. now bears both their names.  Malcolm X frequented the area now known as Jazz Square near Massachusetts and Columbus avenues and was known to attend shows at the Hi Hat Lounge. He was arrested in 1946 on burglary charges and was imprisoned until 1952.  The former home of civil rights leader Malcolm X, at 72 Dale St. in Roxbury. Keith Bedford / The Boston Globe  After his release, Malcolm X became a minister for the Nation of Islam and an outspoken civil rights leader. He parted ways with the Nation of Islam in 1964, made a pilgrimage to Mecca, and founded the Organization of Afro-American Unity, a secular political organization devoted to securing rights for Black people.  Advertisement:  At the age of 39, he was assassinated on Feb. 21, 1965, while speaking at the Audubon Ballroom in New York City.  “Recognizing Malcolm X’s birthday as a municipal holiday would not only honor his presence in Boston, but also pay tribute to his enduring legacy as a champion of civil rights and social justice,” Councilor Brian Worrell said during Wednesday’s meeting. “His teachings of empowerment, self-respect, and community uplifting continue to resonate, inspiring us to continue to confront systemic racism as we strive for a more equitable society.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvc3Rvbi5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzLzIwMjMvMDUvMTgvYm9zdG9uLWNpdHktY291bmNpbC1zdXBwb3J0cy1tYWxjb2xtLXgtYmlydGhkYXktbXVuaWNpcGFsLWhvbGlkYXkv0gF6aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYm9zdG9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvMjAyMy8wNS8xOC9ib3N0b24tY2l0eS1jb3VuY2lsLXN1cHBvcnRzLW1hbGNvbG0teC1iaXJ0aGRheS1tdW5pY2lwYWwtaG9saWRheS8_YW1wPTE?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2019-05-05","Not Discerned","{""NewYork"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","Fri 19 May 2023 06:40:50","New York rapper billy woods teamed up with producer Kenny Segal for their second full-length collaboration “Maps.” Released on May 5, “Maps” is a surreal concept album about traveling and tour life with an excellent array of features, including Aesop Rock, Danny Brown and Quelle Chris. Pushing an already-stunning discography into new terrain while maintaining his piercing rhymes and idiosyncratic metaphorical style, “Maps” unequivocally establishes woods as one of the greatest lyricists of our generation.  woods has garnered a cult following in recent years, thanks to an extended run of incredible records. This includes his 2022 album “Aethiopes,” a complex portrait of the constructed fictions and lived realities of the African diaspora, densely packed with historical references and detailed imagery rapped over atmospheric samples, such as Ethiopian jazz in the opening track “Asylum.” woods spent his childhood in Africa due to his father’s participation in the Zimbabwe War of Liberation, so certain elements of its depictions are drawn from his own experience.  woods previously collaborated with Segal on their 2019 album “Hiding Places,” a tense, haunting exploration of his fears and irritations. But woods’ imagery and Segal’s sampling convey a very different mood on their new record, swapping out cramped, shadowy crawlspaces for endless, sunlit expanses.  As a result of his success, woods has found himself on tour for the first time in his decades-long career. In spite of this, he still wishes to retain the anonymity he had when he was completely unknown — woods has never revealed his government name and always requires his face to be blurred in photographs. Somewhat incredibly, most of his concert attendees have respected this wish.  Rather than immersing listeners in the distant places he’s reached while traveling the world, woods focuses on the liminal spaces in between. Planes, airports and concert venues are the album’s primary settings.  woods’ rhymes frequently blend meditations on his own experiences, whether it be his divorce or the deaths of his loved ones, with references to various historical and cultural events. His personal and social worlds become one and the same. A perfect example can be found in the transition from chorus to verse in the song “Red Dust” on “Hiding Places”: “It’s not the act, it’s the touch / It’s how she arch her back when she- / Knock the plane out the sky / Spark the genocide.” In suddenly shifting the narrative to the 1994 assassination of Rwandan President Juvénal Habyarimana, woods draws a parallel between sexual and violent drives.  It’s clear that woods doesn’t make music intended for a pleasant listening experience. Though considerably softer and sunnier than all of woods’ previous albums, “Maps” is still filled with that familiar bitterness and sense of dread.  In the song “Facetime,” woods raps wistfully about a failing long distance relationship over a sparkling beat: “Watching unbroken wild ponies run wild at sundown / Only the lonely big tree like a sundial.”  Segal’s production perfectly complements the tone of woods’ lyrics. His samples are wonderfully textured, shifting from smooth jazz to distorted, foreboding beats in the record’s middle stretch, more fitting for the billy woods that fans are used to.  Of course, this is where Danny Brown comes in, delivering some trademark over-the-top aggressive bars on the track “Year Zero,” including a delightful MF DOOM reference: “Danny Brown back like skinny white girls / Workin’ out, ’bout to get the money like curls.”  woods is a masterful storyteller with a remarkable talent for painting the little details of life. The misfortunes conveyed through letters and voicemails, the bass from a party in the halls trembling the walls of his Brooklyn apartment, the happiness he waits for by the window “like Malcolm X” — woods remarks on it all with the grim, humorous sarcasm of a man who has spent a lifetime just barely getting by. But he finds relief in the joys of weed and food: “The nose is Pine-Sol and turpentine / But the taste remind me of Jamaican oranges that look like limes,” he raps on “Houdini.” “Maps” is filled with these beautiful sensory details.  “One sip of New York City tapwater, I’m back dialed in,” woods says gently at the beginning of “NYC Tapwater,” the album’s mellow penultimate track marking the conclusion of his travels. As he describes the city over a gorgeous, tender instrumental, it’s like we’re right there with him. It’s a dreamy ode to his home, but he closes the song by unveiling the city’s harsh reality, warning a boy about the omnipresence and ruthlessness of the New York Police Department.  On the closing track “As the Crow Flies,” woods reflects on fatherhood and mortality in a simple yet striking verse. “Tear-streaked apologies, balled fists, it’s a trip / That this is something we did,” he says to the child’s mother. “I watch him grow, wondering how long I got to live.”  Though utterly despondent as ever, woods seems to be facing the future head-on. “Already knew the options was lose/lose / Baby, that’s nothing new,” woods raps on “The Layover.” “That just make it easier to choose, it’s up to you.” What uncharted territories will he take his music to next?

A Chechen-born Islamist and refugee, Anzorov, killed history teacher Samuel Paty over a dispute about showing cartoons of Muhammed to students in the Parisian suburb of Conflans-Sainte-Honorine in October 2020 in an incident that highlighted the growing gulf between the French Republic and Islamist extremism.  Paty evoked the anger of Muslim students and their parents after allegedly showing the controversial cartoons by the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. A viral hate campaign by Islamist preachers spread Paty’s personal details shortly before the murder.  Prosecutors confirmed that a total of 14 associates of Anzorov will face trial for assisting in the murder, including six teenagers who allegedly conducted surveillance before the assassination occurred. Anzorov arrived on the school premises on 16 October 2020, and bribed students to ascertain the location of Paty before stabbing the teacher to death and posting a picture of his decapitated corpse on social media.  Also among the suspects are an Islamic preacher, alleged to have directly been in contact with Anzorov over Twitter, and two friends who accompanied him to purchase the knife.  Anzorov was shot by police shortly after the murder. President Macron declared the attack a direct assault on the values of the French state and vowed to redouble the country’s anti-terror efforts.  The incident set in motion a dramatic diplomatic spat between France and the Islamic world with President Erdoğan of Turkey seemingly justifying the murder by comparing the treatment of Muslims in Europe to Jews in the Third Reich and calling for a boycott on French goods.  Outrage ensued after footage emerged of a funeral held for Anzorov in Chechnya with mourners praising the Islamist for his act of jihad. In 2021, French police launched an investigation after a memorial to the slain teacher was vandalised by suspected Islamists.  In response to the murder, the French National Assembly drafted emergency legislation to fight Islamism. New laws clamping down on foreign funding of mosques and the harassment of public officials were passed in February 2021. France has struggled against Islamist extremism over the past decade with high-profile attacks destabilising the state and fueling a rise of right-wing populism.  Depictions of Muhammed are a contentious issue in Europe and a notorious flashpoint for secular societies and the Islamic world. The Danish Parliament is currently reviewing how schools teach about the 2005-2006 cartoon controversy. This question of curriculum triggered a wave of anti-Danish hate globally.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vZXVyb3BlYW5jb25zZXJ2YXRpdmUuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL25ld3MvZnJhbmNlLTE0LWZhY2UtdHJpYWwtZm9yLWNvbXBsaWNpdHktaW4tdGVhY2hlci1iZWhlYWRpbmcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

However, sources concede the Kinahan cartel would “grasp any opportunity with both hands” to murder the patriarch of the Hutch family.  After being cleared of the murder charge, ‘The Monk’ spent most of his time staying at his family home in Clontarf.  Earlier this month it emerged that the State is to oppose an application from Hutch to have his legal costs covered after he was found not guilty of murder at the Special Criminal Court sitting in Dublin.  He was cleared of the high-profile murder of Kinahan gang member David Byrne at Dublin hotel seven years ago.  Mr Byrne (33) died after being shot six times at a crowded boxing weigh-in event at the hotel on February 5, 2016, in one of the first deadly attacks of the Hutch-Kinahan gangland feud.  The attack was described by the court as a “meticulously planned high-velocity assassination” by a six-man hit team which left one man dead and two others injured.  It “sparked mayhem on the streets of Dublin” and resulted in a “series of callous murders”, the court heard.

Upon acquitting Hutch, the three-judge court stated in blunt terms that there was a “reasonable possibility” the Regency attack was planned by Patsy Hutch and that ‘The Monk’ stepped in, as head of the family, to try to sort out the aftermath, “particularly as his own life was at risk”.  The Special Criminal Court also found, beyond reasonable doubt, that “members of the Hutch family were responsible for the attack at the Regency and the murder of David Byrne”.  The Kinahan cartel attempted to murder Gerry Hutch in Spain on New Year’s Eve 2015, but he escaped.  He was arrested in a police raid on a restaurant in Fuengirola on the Costa del Sol.  He was extradited at the end of 2021 and brought to Wheatfield Prison to the 3G landing where he remained until he was cleared of murder.  While Hutch was acquitted of the Regency murder, two of Hutch’s close associates were jailed last week for their role in the attack.  Taxi driver Paul Murphy (61) was sentenced to nine years and builder Jason Bonney (52) to eight and a half years for facilitating the killing of Byrne.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdW5kYXl3b3JsZC5jb20vY3JpbWUvaXJpc2gtY3JpbWUvZ2VycnktdGhlLW1vbmstaHV0Y2gtc2VjcmV0bHktbGVhdmVzLWlyZWxhbmQtYWZ0ZXItYmVpbmctY2xlYXJlZC1vZi1yZWdlbmN5LW11cmRlci9hMzkxOTY0MDUxLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"assassination","1947-08-14","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 08:52:48","Seeing the events unfolding across the border these past few weeks with the arrest of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf Party Premier and former Prime Minister, Imran Khan, Tarek's observations once more ring true.  Jinnah was a latter-day caliph and despite his famous 1947 Lahore speech which every secular, rational Pakistani has memorised about safeguarding the rights of minorities — he left behind authoritarian precedents, inherited by the Pakistan military — that are still practised and implemented in Pakistan today.  The Muslim League's rallying cry of religious frenzy which ultimately sold the idea of Pakistan to the Indian Muslim masses of 'Islam is in Danger' 'Islam khatre mein hai' became the bonding agent between the military and civilian dictators and the mad mullahs which today comprise the US-sponsored deep state of Pakistan.  With the birth of Pakistan, created to keep the Hindu-majority of the Indian civilisation from ever wielding power, the Indian Muslim population got divided by the political machinations of the Muslim League and the ever-helpful British into 150 million in Pakistan, 140 million in Bangladesh and 160 million in India (today roughly 174 million).  The civil strife which has plagued the Islamic world since the death of the Prophet in 632 AD further took the lives of one million fellow Muslims when the Two-Nation Theory was exposed as bogus in the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971.  Yet not happy with an Islamic State, the Pakistan Army which found itself with a country to run, chose the erstwhile former kingdom of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh as its reason to launch a war for ‘bleeding India with a thousand cuts' Ghazwa-e-Hind (Islamic Jihad) for the next 75 plus years.  So, it is surreally satisfying to see karma visit the country today with the videos of Pakistani civilians wielding AK-47s and firing them on the Pakistan Army personnel.  The same Ak-47s that destroyed two generations of Kashmiri youth, now buried six-feet under and a third one radicalised enough to not consider India as our home, as our roots, our civilisational identity.  We, the children of the conflict saw the pre-conflict period of the 80s with relative peace and lost our childhood and youth to the three-decade ISI sponsored proxy war by Pakistan, witnessing the forced exodus and ethnic cleansing of not only Kashmiri Pandits (indigenous Hindus) but also secular Muslims.  We saw Kashmiri communal leaders rhetorically spew Jihad speeches from the mosque pulpits and recruit entire generations into the carnage while raking in moolah from the anti-India network of disinformation groups and NGOs — to build their palatial bungalows, sustain their jet-setting lifestyles and send their sons and daughters to elite universities across the globe.  It was later through Pakistani journalist Arif Jamal's Shadow War: The Untold Story of Jihad in Kashmir, published in 2009, that we came to know what had hit our generation in 1989 and how the Jihad had been long in the making in not just General Zia's war room plans of 1965, but further in 1947 itself (Raiders in Kashmir by Major General Akbar Khan (Retired) of the Pakistan Army).  Arif Jamal’s Shadow War delves into the Jihad in Kashmir, exploring the various dimensions of the armed insurgency and the role of terror groups, particularly those influenced by jihadist ideologies.  It even shed light on the tactics and strategies employed by jihadist groups operating in Kashmir and their connections to wider global jihadist movements.  In the book, Jamal drew upon his research and first-hand experiences (interviews with Kashmiri terrorists in training camps, men we grew up with) to present an account of the Kashmir conflict that went beyond the mainstream narratives, aiming to uncover the lesser-known aspects of the armed insurgency or as it would be known as The Lost Rebellion: Kashmir in the Nineties' (Manoj Joshi, 1999).  The azadi war cry which until a few years ago reverberated on the campuses of Left-bastion universities across India, is today now heard on the streets of Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, Quetta, in the provinces of Sindh and everywhere in Pakistan.  Instead of 'we want azadi from Endia' (a derogatory, deliberate misspelling of India signifying its end), the people were screaming for azadi (freedom) from the Pakistan Army and its alliance with the ‘mad mullahs’, another term made popular by author Salman Rushdie, a victim of jihadi interpretations of Islam for decades.  I cannot visit the graves of my male peers, male batchmates, and my late husband due to the sharia interpretations of Islam in Kashmir but it was a kind of closure to see the mayhem in Pakistan; a country which spilled so much blood on the streets of Kashmir for thirty long years and challenged the territorial integrity of India to which its Army and paramilitary and security personnel had to respond.  The State did act like a bull-in-a-china-shop often with its knee-jerk reactions, but by the time the State got its counterinsurgency and counter-terrorism act together, Kashmir had lost entire generations with half-widows and orphan children scattered across its beautiful landscape.  Today the Kashmiris themselves — the older generation who are alive and remember the 1947 'kabaili' raid by Pakistani Rangers and tribesmen and the younger generations who have lost their loved ones — realise their folly of the 1970s, 80s and 90s to take on the Indian State and Indian Army with AK-47s. That too funded by an Islamic State which itself failed to maintain its initial objective of a ‘state of Islam’ in the Prophet's message.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vc3dhcmFqeWFtYWcuY29tL3BvbGl0aWNzL3Bha2lzdGFuLXZzLXBha2lzdGFuLXNlbWJsYW5jZS1vZi1jbG9zdXJlLWZvci1rYXNobWlyaXPSAWRodHRwczovL3N3YXJhanlhbWFnLmNvbS9hbXAvc3RvcnkvcG9saXRpY3MlMkZwYWtpc3Rhbi12cy1wYWtpc3Rhbi1zZW1ibGFuY2Utb2YtY2xvc3VyZS1mb3Ita2FzaG1pcmlz?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2023-05-10","Not Discerned","{""SanFrancisco"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","Fri 19 May 2023 01:14:48","Dianne Feinstein is back and voting in the Senate, but the drama surrounding her return has barely begun.  Without diminishing the sad circumstances of a legendary lawmaker in decline, the plot points can nonetheless read like a politico's mashup of ""House of Cards"" and ""Veep,"" with a score written by fans of ""The West Wing"" -- or ""Succession.""  At 89 years old and fresh off a bout recovering from shingles that resulted in serious complications, including brain inflammation, Feinstein, D-Calif., returned to the Capitol last week appearing weak and disoriented.  When asked about the reception from colleagues after her return, Feinstein seemed to claim to reporters that she hadn't been away at all, even though she missed more than 90 floor votes and left the Judiciary Committee unable to advance some contested nominees since February.  By her side since she's been back has been a new figure with a familiar family connection: Nancy Corinne Prowda, the eldest daughter of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Pelosi's support for her longtime friend quieted calls for Feinstein to resign in recent weeks, and now her daughter is helping Feinstein do her job with minimal disruption or embarrassment.  Pelosi's support, while no doubt stemming from genuine affection for her fellow San Francisco political icon, is also wrapped up in the emerging race to succeed Feinstein in the Senate in next year's elections. If her seat were to become vacant before then, it would be filled by Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has vowed to appoint a Black woman to the job, while Pelosi has endorsed a white man, Rep. Adam Schiff.  That's a lot to hoist on the shoulders of a frail almost-nonagenarian whose mental challenges, particularly regarding her memory, have long been an open secret in Washington. (Feinstein, for her part, has previously pushed back on any such characterization.) There remain indications that she might have to miss further work, with her office committing to a ""lighter schedule"" for the senator and confirming on Thursday, in light of reporting in The New York Times, that her recent health issues were far more serious than acknowledged publicly.  Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer escorts Sen. Dianne Feinstein as she arrives at the U.S. Capitol following a long absence due to health issues May 10, 2023, in Washington. Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images  A senator missing votes due to illness is neither unusual nor, necessarily, cause for political alarm, particularly when that senator represents a state as deeply blue as California. But any one absence essentially erases Democrats' voting edge in the current 51-49 Senate and leaves the critical Judiciary Committee -- charged with sending potential judges to the Senate floor -- entirely deadlocked.  What's more, Democrats are staring down a Senate map in 2024 that, Feinstein's safe seat aside, looks brutal for their prospects of retaining control. And, of course, their party is being led by an 80-year-old president whose own reelection prospects are clouded by questions around his age and acuity, as shown in a recent ABC News/Washington Post poll.  Activists inside the Democratic Party have for years been deriding the Senate as dysfunctional, clamoring for rules changes to overcome what they call Republican obstructionism. Now, many of those same voices are in the awkward position of pushing a towering figure in state and national politics to step down with a year and a half left in her term.  Feinstein's latest illness kept her from the Senate starting in February, though calls for her resignation didn't reach a critical mass until last month when California Rep. Ro Khanna became the first sitting Democratic member of Congress to call for his home-state senator to leave office, saying it was clear that she could ""no longer fulfill her duties.""  ""We need to put the country ahead of personal loyalty,"" Khanna said at the time.  Pelosi has defended her with a subtle reminder that infirm senators are nothing new -- and have mostly been men who have been allowed to close out their careers on their own terms.  Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., is flanked by aides as she returns to the Senate Judiciary Committee following a more than two-month absence as she was being treated for a case of shingles, at the Capitol in Washington, May 11, 2023. J. Scott Applewhite/AP  ""I've never seen them go after a man who was sick in the Senate in that way,"" Pelosi has said.  Left unsaid by her was the fact that she is backing Schiff in the rare open race to succeed Feinstein after Feinstein retires in January 2025. Khanna is backing Rep. Barbara Lee, who -- perhaps not coincidentally -- is a Black woman and is therefore at least a potential pick to fill a vacancy were Feinstein to resign before 2025.  Anyone selected by Newsom would have to run for the full six-year term on his or her own, but they would get an incumbency advantage in the March 5 all-party primary. Newsom pledged to choose a Black woman if another vacancy arose on his watch, after having chosen Sen. Alex Padilla -- a longtime friend who is Latino -- to succeed now-Vice President Kamala Harris, whose exit left the Senate with exactly zero Black women.  Newsom himself says he considers Feinstein one of his oldest personal friends and he has urged her to stay in office as long as she sees fit. But he has acknowledged the fraught nature of potentially choosing yet another replacement senator.  Sen. Dianne Feinstein takes her seat at a business hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill May 11, 2023 in Washington. Drew Angerer/Getty Images  ""There's a lot of politics and a lot of folks polluting the political process,"" Newsom told Elex Michaelson, a Los Angeles reporter, earlier this month. ""For those who say, 'Enough of Newsom making these picks, I haven't…' I get it -- I'm with you. I understand. It's just the nature of what it is.""  That comment was read by some as a hint that Newsom might choose a caretaker senator who would vow not to compete for a full term next year. It could all shape the political future of Newsom, who -- at age 55 -- is seen a potential presidential contender if Biden steps aside, or in 2028.  The positioning comes in a complex political environment, with questions of ambition, political representation and urgencies of legislative progress colliding. Feinstein might appreciate the layers of intrigue, even though they might not match the wild and tragic circumstances that left her as mayor of San Francisco in 1978: the assassination of Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk.  In the meantime, for now at least, Feinstein is doing the most basic part of her job: casting as many votes as she can. Yet that's happening with the knowledge among friends and supporters that an unmatched legacy could be tarnished by how a career comes to an end -- and the unsavory conversations that surround it.  Editor's note: This story has been updated to show that a quote attributed to Dianne Feinstein was instead from Gavin Newsom.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vUG9saXRpY3MvZGlhbm5lLWZlaW5zdGVpbnMtc2VuYXRlLXJldHVybi1oaWdobGlnaHRzLXNhZC1kZWNsaW5lLWFtaWQvc3Rvcnk_aWQ9OTk0MzcwNznSAXFodHRwczovL2FiY25ld3MuZ28uY29tL2FtcC9Qb2xpdGljcy9kaWFubmUtZmVpbnN0ZWlucy1zZW5hdGUtcmV0dXJuLWhpZ2hsaWdodHMtc2FkLWRlY2xpbmUtYW1pZC9zdG9yeT9pZD05OTQzNzA3OQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"assassination","1973-05-25","Not Discerned","{""DunLaoghaire"", ""Dublin"", ""Ireland""}","Fri 19 May 2023 03:43:10","Murder of AG shatters peace and innocence (May 1973 revisited)  On a normal Friday night in Kingstown, shots rang out in the quiet neighbourhood of the Fort Charlotte area, a peaceful residential area. It was not like today when the sound of gunfire is  one to which many communities have become accustomed. No, not SVG 50 years ago. So, what was going on?  Vincentians didn’t know it at the time, but the peace and stability of the country were to be rudely disturbed over the next two weeks and then an unprecedented series of events including legal battles right up to the British Privy Council were to unfurl and make their mark on our history.  While rumours circulated during that fateful night, it was not until Saturday morning that the official word came out. The Attorney General, a Dominican barrister Cecil Eric Rawle, who had taken up residence here, served as Chief Magistrate and was quite a well-known figure among all social classes, had been shot at his home and was hospitalized critically injured.  In a separate incident, a supermarket owner was also shot and wounded in what appeared to be a robbery attempt.  The Police announced that they were searching for three suspects, Junior “Spirit” Cottle, Marcus “Bomani” James and Loraine “Blackie” Laidlow. Both Cottle and James were members of a fledgling Black Power organization, grandly named the Black Liberation Action Committee (BLAC), formed just one year before and based in the lower Kingstown area. That connection was to have huge ramifications as to how this story would develop.  AG Rawle died two days later and was buried in a mournful ceremony shortly afterwards. In the meantime, the rumour mill kept churning out stories. Not surprisingly “Black Power” became the target of attacks, but local politics was such that stories spread that Rawle was a victim of an assassination plot relating to election petitions filed after the historic tied election of April 1972, suggesting that the accused were paid assassins. Nothing but a dastardly lie.  The death of Mr. Rawle brought about a dramatic change in the behaviour of the police both to local Black Power activists and in general to the youth of SVG in both Kingstown and rural communities. Previously there had been occasional skirmishes based on the police attempts to crack down on ganga smoking. There was little love lost between the police and the rising conscious youth.  The Black Power influence was sweeping the Caribbean and SVG stood up to be counted. There were four small, organized groups in the Kingstown area and at least one based in the rural area, in Diamond Village. There had been occasional protests and demonstrations about police brutality, but the most prominent altercation had occurred in February, 1972 when there were protests against the visit of Margaret of Windsor, sister of the Queen of Britain, and its colonies. It was as though the local middle-class elite had gone crazy that young Vincentians were daring to challenge colonialism. The wrath of the Police Force was unleashed in an unprecedented manner to beat and arrest the demonstrators including a female secondary school student.  All of this paled in comparison with the response to the killing of the AG. A virtual reign of terror was unleashed, with young men being arbitrarily beaten and illegally detained as police desperately sought information about the murder. A month-long manhunt was launched for the suspects, during which Marcus James was shot and killed and finally, on Sunday, May 27, the police surrounded Cottle at his humble residence in the Lower Kingstown area, “the Ghetto” as it was popularly known then.  The behaviour of the police that day was a forerunner of things to come, for having surrounded the area, they indiscriminately tear gassed the entire area, affecting old and young alike in their attempt to flush out Cottle. Little did we realize at the time that a mere two years later, we would witness the same tear gas treatment against teachers, students and the general public.  It was a traumatic experience for me as one of the leaders of BLAC. In the week leading up to the shooting of the AG, as a young teacher at Bishops College, Kingstown, I had been involved in altercations with the management after it consistently failed to address complaints about the racist practices of a British priest who was then the Principal. It led to my suspension and on just the day before the Rawle shooting, the students had staged a protest march around Kingstown calling for my reinstatement.  The new situation put all of that in the pot. I was summarily fired and worse, the leadership of the country went on radio to charge that the murder was part of an assassination plot and that a list was found of the names of several citizens earmarked as victims.  Dangerous lies! The Rawle affair was nothing of the sort. It was an exercise in reckless adventurism. But the politics of the time determined otherwise. Faced with the situation, we as “young revolutionaries”, as we called ourselves, made a martyr out of Cottle, a “revolutionary hero “as we said then. I must take full responsibility for my role in it as we attempted to combat the injustice.

Read on:Firstly, working on this documentary also meant reliving Gauri and all that she signified. Second, I wondered if I had the bandwidth to deal with the myriad emotions that would arise through this process of reliving her life. My proposal to make this documentary was approved just before the pandemic, and when the pandemic struck, co-ordination and shooting and the safety of crew thereafter became yet another challenge.The journey of making this film was very emotional, and difficult. At the same time, I discovered so much more about Gauri. Back then, I was the closest person in the family to her, and I recall cribbing about how she was too busy to spend time with the family. However, the more people I met, whose lives had been touched and impacted by her over the years, the more I realised that she was much larger than the ordinariness of day-to-day life. I met people in the forests and tribal areas, in Bababudangiri and Chikkamagaluru, where the first seeds of her activism were born. People of all religious backgrounds came together to co-exist in these places, and Gauri was in the thick of it all. They told me so many stories about my sister and the work she did that we were all left in tears. Gauri went beyond journalism and activism – tackling issues at the grassroot level, taking it a step further and ensuring they were heard by the government. I never understood her purpose when she was alive.Gauri was completely misunderstood. After she was killed, there were so many hate trolls coming our way and to know how misunderstood she was hurt us even more. In the film, we delve into how she was trying to intervene to come into democratic form, to fight not with guns and arms, but peacefully. The film includes a lot of actual footage of her meetings that showcase the truth of her mission, all thanks to her cameraman Deepu, who worked with her for over 20 years.The one scene I didn’t want to show in the documentary was her actual death. Till today, I am unable to face that scene even though I was the first to visit the site of the shooting. I was called in at court as the first witness during the murder trail. The most difficult and devastating part was having to come face to face with her killers. There was a video conference from jails across Karnataka where they were imprisoned, and I didn’t look at them. Even today, I don’t know if I can face them… knowing that they pulled the trigger, and knowing that they had planned to do this so for so long. I can’t come to terms with that. She is still around, giving me a lot of work to do. It is an unbearable loss, and I miss talking to her as we were more friends than sisters. The film has been a catharsis, and a healing. After I went through her journey through this documentary, I understood her better. It’s been therapeutic.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9saWZlLXN0eWxlL3Nwb3RsaWdodC9pLW5ldmVyLXVuZGVyc3Rvb2QtZ2F1cmlzLXB1cnBvc2Utd2hlbi1zaGUtd2FzLWFsaXZlLWthdml0aGEtbGFua2VzaC9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy8xMDAzMzEzNzUuY21z0gGSAWh0dHBzOi8vbS50aW1lc29maW5kaWEuY29tL2xpZmUtc3R5bGUvc3BvdGxpZ2h0L2ktbmV2ZXItdW5kZXJzdG9vZC1nYXVyaXMtcHVycG9zZS13aGVuLXNoZS13YXMtYWxpdmUta2F2aXRoYS1sYW5rZXNoL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy8xMDAzMzEzNzUuY21z?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Saudi PIF has stakes (some of which are held through subsidiaries) in Activision Blizzard, Capcom, Embracer Group, Nexon, Nintendo, Take-Two Interactive and more. Now it's doubled an existing stake in Electronic Arts (opens in new tab), and owns just under 10% of the global giant.  The PIF previously held 16.01 million shares in EA, but now holds 24.81 million–The total number of shares in EA stands at over 274 million, so that's around 9% of the total. The 'why' is no real mystery, as business is booming for EA. Its most recent results showed revenues of $7.4 billion for the last financial year, up 6% year-on-year, with the publisher predicting between $7.3 and $7.7 billion for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024. In the earnings call EA largely credited these results to its live services performance in games such as Apex Legends and FIFA 23.  Saudi Arabia, for its part, has been pouring billions into games because it wants to make itself less completely dependent on oil. But Saudi investment is always controversial, because the country has an appalling human rights record, criminalises homosexuality (with punishments ranging from flogging to execution), and its crown prince Mohammed bin Salman allegedly ordered the 2018 assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi (opens in new tab). The Saudi government engaged in extensive efforts to cover up Khashoggi's killing. The crown prince chairs the Saudi PIF.  Unfortunately, however, money talks.

Hearing the plea on Thursday (May 18), the Supreme Court bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Ahsanuddin Amanullah asked the petitioner to serve copies of the petition and the Bombay high court’s order to the CBI, LiveLaw reported.  Senior advocate Anand Grover, appearing for Mukta, told the bench on Thursday that two absconding accused have not been found or arrested yet, and the CBI has said it is still conducting further investigations on whether there was a larger conspiracy.  Dabholkar, an anti-superstition crusader, was shot dead by two bike-borne assailants on August 20, 2013. In April this year, nine years after Dabholkar was murdered, the Bombay high court had said that it will no longer be monitoring the probe and “no further monitoring is required”.  “There cannot be perpetual monitoring. Some monitoring is fine but law is clear that when a charge sheet is filed, the rights of the accused are to be considered,” the high court had said.  His family, however, has disputed this – saying the masterminds behind the murder are yet to be arrested. The CBI is also reportedly yet to trace the motorcycle or weapons used for the killing. The accused are allegedly linked to the extremist Hindu right organisation Sanatan Sanstha. The same organisation and people have been linked to the killings of CPI leader Govind Pansare, Kannada writer M.M. Kalburgi and journalist Gauri Lankesh.  In the Supreme Court on Thursday, the bench said the high court cannot monitor each investigation. To this, Grover replied that the CBI should complete its investigation, and until then the court should monitor it.  “Your point is that CBI should conclude investigation so that trial can begin?” the court then asked, according to LiveLaw, and Grover responded in the affirmative.  The matter will be heard again in the second week of July.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vdGhld2lyZS5pbi9sYXcvbmFyZW5kcmEtZGFiaG9sa2Fycy1kYXVnaHRlci1hcHByb2FjaGVzLXNjLWFnYWluc3QtaGNzLXJlZnVzYWwtdG8ta2VlcC1tb25pdG9yaW5nLWNiaS1wcm9iZdIBgAFodHRwczovL20udGhld2lyZS5pbi9hcnRpY2xlL2xhdy9uYXJlbmRyYS1kYWJob2xrYXJzLWRhdWdodGVyLWFwcHJvYWNoZXMtc2MtYWdhaW5zdC1oY3MtcmVmdXNhbC10by1rZWVwLW1vbml0b3JpbmctY2JpLXByb2JlL2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","1978-11-01","Not Discerned","{""SanFrancisco"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 22:41:00","WASHINGTON (AP) — Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s office said Thursday that she is suffering from Ramsay Hunt syndrome, a complication from the shingles virus that can paralyze part of the face, and that she contracted encephalitis while recovering from the virus earlier this year.  Feinstein, 89, had not previously disclosed those medical details, though she said in a statement last week that she had suffered complications from the virus. The longtime California senator returned from a more than two-month absence on May 10 after weeks of questions about her declining health and whether she would be back in the Senate at all.  Adam Russell, a spokesman for Feinstein, said that the encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain, “resolved itself shortly after she was released from the hospital in March.” Feinstein continues to have complications from the Ramsay Hunt syndrome, Russell said.  Russell confirmed the two complications after the New York Times first reported them, raising questions about whether she had been hiding the extent of her illnesses. Upon her return last week, Feinstein was using a wheelchair and noticeably thinner, and has appeared confused at times when speaking to reporters or being wheeled through the halls.  “The senator previously disclosed that she had several complications related to her shingles diagnosis,” Russell said in the statement. “As discussed in the New York Times article, those complications included Ramsay Hunt syndrome and encephalitis.”  Feinstein’s face has appeared partially paralyzed since she returned to the Senate, stirring some speculation about whether she had had a stroke. Ramsay Hunt syndrome is a complication that occurs when the shingles virus reaches a facial nerve near the ears. It can also cause hearing loss.  Encephalitis can also be caused by shingles. The swelling of the brain can have a number of different symptoms, including personality changes, seizures, stiffness, confusion and problems with sight or hearing, according to the Mayo Clinic.  Aides to Feinstein said last week that she is still recovering from her illness and would operate on a reduced schedule. Since she has returned, she has missed some votes where she was not needed. On Wednesday, for example, she missed the first three Senate votes of the day but appeared for the last two, in which the margin was much closer.  Feinstein has faced questions for several years about her clearly declining health and her mental acuity. In February Feinstein said she would not run for re-election in 2024.  But some Democrats have pushed for her to leave sooner. A member of the California congressional delegation, Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, called on her to resign as she stayed away from Washington for more than ten weeks, and several other House progressives have echoed his call. And Senate Democrats were increasingly anxious during Feinstein’s absence as they were unable to confirm some of President Joe Biden’s judicial nominees with a narrow 51-49 majority.  As Democrats worried, Feinstein made an unusual request to be temporarily replaced on the Judiciary panel while she remained out of the Senate. But Republicans last month blocked a vote, saying there was little precedent for a temporary committee replacement and that they didn’t want to help Democrats confirm the most partisan judges. Others said they thought Democrats were unfairly trying to push her out of office.  Two weeks later, Democrats said that Feinstein would return to Washington.  A senator for more than three decades, Feinstein has had a groundbreaking political career and shattered gender barriers. She was the first woman to serve as president of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in the 1970s and the first female mayor of San Francisco. She ascended to that post after the November 1978 assassinations of then-Mayor George Moscone and City Supervisor Harvey Milk by a former supervisor, Dan White. Feinstein found Milk’s body.  In the Senate, she was the first woman to head the Senate Intelligence Committee and the first woman to serve as the Judiciary Committee’s top Democrat.  Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

YouTuber j0nathan is back with some more information on the next game in the Assassin’s Creed series. This time, he claims that Assassin’s Creed Mirage will feature gameplay similar to that of Assassin’s Creed Origins. He also shared several other details regarding the gameplay, in addition to an expected release date.    Based on what the YouTuber stated, Assassin’s Creed Mirage’s expected release date is October 12, 2023. He said that the game was originally conceived as DLC for Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, but later repurposed into a standalone title as it gained more depths during development. He added that the gameplay is closer to that of Assassin’s Creed Origins, with lots of gadgets and items to use during missions, a smaller skill tree with only around 15 skills to unlock, and several weapons to unlock.  According to j0nathan, Assassin’s Creed Mirage features 4 main assassination targets, similar to the first Assassin’s Creed game, where players will need to investigate the aforementioned targets to know who they are and gain information before assassinating them. The protagonist, Basim, is said to start off as a simple thief who comes across an artifact of the First Civilization. The game’s story is said to explore how the Order went from “The Hidden Ones” to the assassins.  Although the world map is comprised of only Baghdad, the city itself is much bigger than Paris in Assassin’s Creed Unity, as it also has villages and desert areas on the outskirts. Missions will involve stealth, such as tailing NPCs and listening in on their conversations. The YouTuber added that Assassin’s Creed Mirage’s parkour isn’t as fluid as it was in Assassin’s Creed Unity. The game also marks a return for factions, with which you’ll have the opportunity to recruit thieves, mercenaries etc., much like in the Assassin’s Creed games featuring Ezio.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vdHdpc3RlZHZveGVsLmNvbS9hc3Nhc3NpbnMtY3JlZWQtbWlyYWdlLWxlYWstZ2FtZXBsYXktc2ltaWxhci10by1vcmlnaW5zL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

This is the reason why on parts of the pardon were submitted in proceedings related to the murder, the lawyer said in a court sitting on the case filed by the Caruana Galizia family against Theuma and others allegedly involved in the plan to kill the journalist.  ADVERTISEMENT  The suit for damages was originally filed against Yorgen Fenech, who stands accused of being a mastermind in the assassination, together with Alfred and George Degiorgio, two of the hitmen who were given a 40-year jail term each after pleading guilty to the murder last October, and Vincent Muscat, the third hitman, who was earlier given a 15-year jail term after striking a plea deal with prosecutors in exchange for testimony about the murder and that of lawyer Carmel Chircop in 2015.  Theuma’s lawyer informed the court that Theuma was exercising his right to silence in spite of having been granted a pardon to testify about his role in the murder plot.  Fenech had filed separate proceedings seeking Theuma’s prosecution for alleged perjury, a challenge that was rejected but is subject to appeal.  The court ordered the court registrar to produce a copy of Theuma’s testimonies in various proceedings. In Thursday’s session, the assistant registrar of the criminal courts, Stefania Calafato Testa, presented those testimonies, sealed under court order.  Theuma’s lawyer argued that such right to silence was only being invoked because of the challenge proceedings that were still pending at appeal stage. He would willingly declare on oath that he was granted a pardon for the specific reason of testifying about the journalist’s murder.  Theuma was scheduled to testify at Thursday’s sitting but his lawyer had filed a note informing the court of his unavailability owing to a hospital appointment he could not miss.  The applicants’ lawyer, Joseph Zammit Maempel, said that he would summon Theuma to confirm his previous statements.  The next sitting is scheduled for October.

"assassination","2023-11-28","Not Discerned","{""London"", ""GreaterLondon"", ""UnitedKingdom""}","Thu 18 May 2023 13:14:56","A conference held in London this week was subjected to an extraordinary onslaught on social and mainstream media from people who weaponized antisemitism against it.  The conference was on National Conservatism, a concept developed by the Israeli-American philosopher and political theorist Yoram Hazony. Through his key insight that attachment to the nation is a core component of conservatism, he has launched an attempt to reclaim for the West authentically conservative principles that have become muddled and uncertain.  As a result of this confusion, conservatism is failing to protect the Western nation-state against the progressive ideologies that threaten to destroy its culture.  The conference, at which I was one of the speakers, explored where conservatism went wrong and what it should be promoting.  The gathering provided a rare safe space for subjects that many have become too frightened to discuss, such as the transgender cult, the damaging impact of mass immigration and the need to restore the traditional family.  Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate  by email and never miss  our top stories  Those who express such views usually find themselves the targets of intimidation, smears and character assassination. So, unsurprisingly, the reaction of the left to the conference’s attempt to reinvigorate conservatism was to smear its organizers and speakers as fascists, antisemites and nutjobs.  The reason for such vitriol was that, to the left, promoting the traditional family, immigration controls and biological sex—mainstream views for millions of decent, civilized people—is akin to fascism.  Worse, however, were the false claims of antisemitism made to smear conference participants.  One of the speakers, the journalist and author Douglas Murray, talked in his keynote address about the need to have pride in one’s nation. Making the point that nationalism was given a bad name by Nazi Germany, he said, “I see no reason why every other country in the world should be prevented from feeling pride in itself because the Germans mucked up twice in a century.”  This provoked an instant meltdown on Twitter. Murray was accused of minimizing Nazism and the Holocaust and being himself some kind of fascist and Jew-hater.  This was as stupid as it was grotesque. Murray was speaking in his trademark sardonic style. “Mucked up” wasn’t meant to be understood literally. It was a typically English figure of speech called litotes, which is defined as the use of a negative statement in order to emphasize a positive meaning.  “Mucked up” in this context was an ironic understatement to convey the enormity of Germany’s crimes.  Yet one typical tweet called Murray “disgusting openly racist” and expressed “utter contempt” for “suggesting the Holocaust of six million and sparking a destructive war was ‘mucked up.’” As Hazony tweeted in reply, “Yes, Douglas used irony in conveying his utter revulsion at German depravity. … Your reaction is tone deaf and phenomenally unjust.”  In The Guardian, the paper’s deputy political editor Peter Walker accused two other speakers—Conservative MP Miriam Cates and Kevin Roberts, president of the Washington, D.C. think-tank the Heritage Foundation—of using antisemitic dog-whistles.  This accusation was baseless, idiotic and vile.  Walker pointed to Roberts’s repeated use of the word “globalist” to criticize left-wing groups that want to end democracy and impose their views. Even though Walker acknowledged that “globalists” can be used neutrally, he said it had been “condemned by Jewish groups as an antisemitic trope” because it was “associated with the far-right and antisemitic conspiracy theories.”  But “globalism” is used interchangeably with “universalism” simply to describe the “brotherhood of man” thinking prevalent on the left, which prioritizes transnational laws, institutions and values. What’s more, the left itself has often used “globalization” as a term of disapproval to describe international capitalism and multinational companies.  In her speech, Cates said that liberal individualism has proven completely powerless to resist the “cultural Marxism” that is systematically “destroying our children’s souls.”  Walker claimed the phrase “cultural Marxism” has its origins in a conspiracy theory that Marxist scholars of the Frankfurt School in interwar Germany, many of whom were Jewish, devised a program of progressive politics intended to undermine Western democracies.  But “cultural Marxism” is not a conspiracy theory at all. It’s an accurate description of an actual agenda promoted not just by the radicals of the Frankfurt School but by other Marxist thinkers who urged the capture of the culture to overturn the West by infiltrating Marxist dogma from within.  Moreover, the claim that “cultural Marxism” is an antisemitic dog-whistle is innately ludicrous. Marx himself was a profound antisemite. In his 1844 essay “On the Jewish Question,” he wrote, “What is the worldly religion of the Jew? Huckstering. What is his worldly God? Money. … In the final analysis, the emancipation of the Jews is the emancipation of mankind from Judaism.”  It’s not everyone who criticizes “cultural Marxism” who is an antisemite but those who promote Marxism. Those who smear Cates are, in essence, calling her an antisemite for accusing the left of promoting antisemitism. So, this is not only a disgusting smear but profoundly stupid and meaningless.  What’s more, as with globalization, while some of the people being criticized for “cultural Marxism” are Jews, the majority are not.  For example, in 2020, after Britain’s National Trust linked Winston Churchill to slavery and colonialism and the National Maritime Museum threatened to tarnish the reputation of Horatio Nelson, a group of parliamentarians complained that the “institutional custodians of history and heritage” were subscribing to “cultural Marxist dogma.”  Obviously, people can’t be antisemitic if they are directing the accusation of “cultural Marxism” at people who aren’t Jews.  Even more imbecilically, we are being told that “globalization” and “cultural Marxism” are antisemitic dog-whistles just because they’ve been used by neo-Nazis and white supremacists. This is to claim that language used widely by others in a neutral and factual way instantly becomes toxic when it issues from the mouths of bad people.  This absurd argument is also used to suppress criticism of the financier George Soros. It’s entirely legitimate to criticize Soros for his massive funding of anti-Western and anti-Israel causes. Yet anyone who does so is called an antisemite because Soros is a Jew and because some genuine Jew-haters subject him to antisemitic attack.  This means Soros is insulated from criticism because his Jewishness is used as shield for his behavior. In exactly the same way, those who smear Cates and Roberts are using antisemitism as a shield for the predations of the left.  What’s worse is that a number of Jewish Diaspora leaders often endorse such false and despicable accusations, as some did again this week against the NatCon speakers. Still worse is that the people who are thus smeared are as often as not some of the greatest defenders of the Jewish people.  I have personally known Douglas Murray for years. It would be hard to find a more passionately pro-Jew and pro-Israel individual.  Hazony tweeted about Cates and Roberts, “Kevin and Miriam are among the best friends we Jews have in public life. So why slander them in this way?”  Britain’s Home Secretary Suella Braverman is also a staunch friend of Israel and the Jewish people. Yet in 2019, after she criticized “cultural Marxism” for an increasing use of censorship, it was the Board of Deputies of British Jews that attacked her and said she shouldn’t use the phrase again.  The Guardian, of course, is a paper that not only regularly pumps out falsehoods and blood libels against the State of Israel but recently published an appalling antisemitic cartoon linking the then-chairman of the BBC, who happens to be a Jew, to greed, gold and the image of a vampire squid.  Left-wingers—who are presiding over epidemic Jew-hatred in their own ranks—are using the claim of antisemitism to disguise the all-too accurate charge that they are destroying core Western values. It’s appalling that Diaspora Jewish leaders are helping them do so.  Melanie Phillips, a British journalist, broadcaster and author, writes a weekly column for JNS.

"assassination","2023-03-01","Not Discerned","{""Manila"", ""Manila"", ""Philippines""}","Thu 18 May 2023 21:36:00","A former Department of Justice (DOJ) official has purportedly tried to bribe detained witnesses to stop cooperating with authorities investigating the killings of Negros Oriental Gov. Roel Degamo and nine others in March.  Lawyer Levito Baligod, counsel for the Degamo family, did not identify the former official but claimed that the official did so through guards at the detention center of the National Bureau of Investigation.  ADVERTISEMENT  “A certain high-ranking official of the DOJ before, with the rank of [undersecretary], is working with some jail guards at the NBI detention facility to offer money to the detainees so that they won’t cooperate,” he said in a television interview.  Baligod asked Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla and Interior Secretary Benhur Abalos to have the witnesses transferred from the NBI custodial center in Manila to the Philippine National Police facility in Quezon City to “insulate them from the people corrupted or bribed by this former DOJ official.”  Baligod claimed that “no less than four detainees” revealed the bribery attempt at a preliminary investigation hearing at the DOJ last month.  When they rejected the bribe, the witnesses claimed jail guards gave them a hard time and later placed them in the same cell as Martin Miranda, a longtime bodyguard of suspended Negros Oriental Rep. Arnolfo Teves Jr. and one of the respondents in the case.  Remulla said investigations tagged Teves as the “main mastermind” in the March 4 killings of Degamo and his supporters.  Recantations expected  Miranda, on the other hand, was allegedly the “enforcer” who picked 11 former Army soldiers as hit men, helped plan and provide logistical support for the assassination. The witnesses claimed Miranda was now “bullying” them.  Last month, former Justice Undersecretary Reynante Orceo claimed to be representing Miranda, although all 11 respondents denied, at that time, engaging his services and had lawyers from the Public Attorneys Office.  On Monday, Remulla bared that “six to seven” suspects in the Degamo case were now being represented by private lawyers and might recant the statements in their extrajudicial confessions.  “There are no recantations yet, but we expect that to happen. It’s a tactic used by people who want to destroy their previous statements, citing several excuses, but we expect these statements to hold,” Remulla said.  ADVERTISEMENT  Baligod agreed with Remulla and expressed confidence that the suspects would be indicted and that the case would proceed to trial.  “No effect at all. In fact, even if the 11 detained persons at the NBI recant, these would not affect the prosecution,” Baligod said, adding he had two more witnesses to present in court.  ‘Godfather doctrine’  As lawyer of the victims’ families, Baligod will serve as the private prosecutor in support of the state prosecutors who will be assigned to the case.  Baligod argued that they have a good case against Teves, citing the so-called “Godfather doctrine”—after the 1969 crime novel by American author Mario Puzo and later adapted to become a hit film.  He contended that a godfather or crime group leader may be prosecuted based on at least three circumstantial evidence alone, a principle adopted in US jurisprudence.  On May 17, the NBI filed multiple murder, multiple frustrated murder and multiple attempted murder before the National Prosecution Service against Teves, whose location remained unknown at press time.  Teves is not required to appear in the ongoing preliminary investigation, but he has to personally appear during arraignment because flight is prima facie evidence of guilt. If he does not appear in court, he can be tried in absentia.  g/  Your subscription could not be saved. Please try again. Your subscription has been successful.

"assassination","2023-05-18","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 23:36:40","An armed gang near Haiti’s capital ambushed two armored police vehicles and killed an officer in the latest attack against the country’s beleaguered force.  The Haiti National Police, which confirmed the attack, said gangs used Molotov cocktails to set the two armored vehicles on fire while they were in Source Matelas, a community just north of Port-au-Prince where at least 100 Haitians were killed last month in a gang attack.  “Following this attack, one of our brave police officers was unfortunately murdered,” a police statement said. “This criminal act, which is beyond reprehensible, will not go unpunished.”  The ambush occurred sometime between Wednesday night and Thursday morning, police said. It is the latest act of violence against police officers, who are increasingly targeted by armed gangs. At least 24 police officers have been killed so far this year, according to the National Human Rights Defense Network.  Meanwhile, more than 1,400 Haitians have been killed in the first four months in gang-related conflicts, the United Nations has said.  Police did not identify the dead officer, nor did they provide details on whether the officers involved were on active duty when the incident occurred. A police official, dispelling rumors that the officers were returning from Cap-Haïtien, told the Miami Herald that there is a security presence along National Road No. 1 where the attack occurred. He added that an investigation remains ongoing.  While Haitian police officers have stepped up anti-gang operations in recent days, a number of police officers had been temporarily transferred to Cap-Haïtien to beef up security for members of the government who were commemorating the 220th anniversary of the founding of Haiti’s flag on Thursday in the northern city.  Several Haitian media outlets have identified the fallen officer as Roberto Charleston, a member of a specialized police unit. Sources familiar with the incident told the Miami Herald that the attacked occurred at around 2 a.m. Thursday and the officer became trapped. Also, they said, the two armored vehicles that went up in flames were among the fleet of recently acquired Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles the Haitian government purchased from a Canadian company.  Story continues  In its statement, the police leadership said it has already taken action “to tackle and apprehend the thugs.”  The police killing was the second brazen attack in less than 24 hours.  On Wednesday morning, a high-profile investigative judge, Jean Wilner Morin, dodged an assassination attempt as he headed to work.  Two men riding on motorcycles riddled the judge’s black Toyota with bullets, a source close to Morin confirmed to the Miami Herald. The incident happened along Route Frères, and was condemned by the Professional Association of Judges in a statement. Calling the attack “odious,” the association called on Haitian authorites to take responsibility in guaranteeing the safety of citizens.  Morin is in charge of several corruption cases and has been holding hearings before bringing formal charges.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vY2EubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9wb2xpY2Utb2ZmaWNlci1raWxsZWQtaGFpdGktZ2FuZy0yMzM2NDA3NTYuaHRtbNIBU2h0dHBzOi8vY2EubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9hbXBodG1sL3BvbGljZS1vZmZpY2VyLWtpbGxlZC1oYWl0aS1nYW5nLTIzMzY0MDc1Ni5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","1963-11-22","Not Discerned","{""Dallas"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","Fri 19 May 2023 00:21:03","I wrote recently about Austin Killips, the male cyclist, winning a female cycling race. I wanted to defend women’s right to single-sex sport, but also to defend young female athletes from unfair demands that they alone should “do something!” to stop male athletes competing in women’s competitions. One woman who agreed with me was Inga Thompson, and she has since gone further — demanding that those young women begin to object at the start of such events and on the podium. She is calling for men and women to unite to defend women’s sports from the trans-identified men, who seem determined to destroy opportunities for women to compete fairly.  Inga Thompson is a three times Olympic cyclist, a three-times world medal winner, and she has finished on the Tour De France Podium twice. Clearly, she knows a thing or two about what it means to compete as a woman in sports. Her experience of success is so precious to women’s teams now that she has retired from competitive cycling. This year she was given a board role on the newly-established Cynisca Cycling team, formed in conjunction with USA Cycling ahead of the 2023 season.  Young female cyclists are watching and will see it as a cautionary tale  Cynisca proudly states that it is “committed to advancing women in the sport of cycling both on and off the bike”. Inga is dedicated to advancing the interests of young female cyclists, and she was delighted to be joining what she saw as an innovative team. Her experience was not as smooth as she expected, though, and Inga decided to resign from the board in April. She endured a rough ride this week as the team at Cynisca behaved in a shocking way towards her for expressing her political views.  When Inga sent an email politely resigning her post on the board of Cynisca for a new role with Future of Cycling, she would never have expected to receive not a courteous acceptance but a cold and deliberate character assassination of the highest order. The email, widely distributed in the media as the team’s official statement on the matter, blithely waves a hand at Inga’s exceptional value as a board member before proceeding to make some bold claims about her.  Chris Gutowsky, the founder and general manager, distributed the following statement:  Ms. Thompson was invited to the board because of her impressive palmarés and a wealth of knowledge on international race strategy, tactics and training. If shared in the absence of politics, her knowledge and experience would benefit many and advance cycling for everyone. However, she has decided to dedicate her time to excluding people that are otherwise currently eligible to compete in UCI events. She has also attempted to use our team as a platform for her political activity.  It is quite extraordinary of Gutowsky to state that Inga would be valuable if she could keep her mouth shut about her beliefs. Her views, at least in UK law, have been established as worthy of respect in a democratic society. Gutowsky continued:  Ms. Thompson’s social media presence include dehumanisation of transgender people, spreading misinformation, demagoguery, and personal attacks on anyone who opposes her views.  Inga Thompson is astounded to be smeared in this way by her former boss. Her own letter of resignation shows a desire to protect Cynisca’s reputation, with deliberate sensitivity and care for the success of the team. Gutowsky, by return, seems not only peeved but determined to drag her reputation through the mud. His attitude was embraced with seeming glee by former competitive cyclist Anne-Marije Rook, as she poured it into a hit piece for Cycling Weekly. Inga was offered no right to reply but was instead blocked by Rook on social media. It is distressing to see Inga treated this way, knowing that young female cyclists are watching and will see it as a cautionary tale against speaking up for women’s right to female only sport. Inga is right, however — those women must take courage from the example she is setting for them, or they are going to have to fight for their podium places so much harder down the line.  She fears for the athletes she has left behind and how they may be treated  Gutowsky wrote, “Despite the negativity fostered by Ms. Thompson, we are succeeding and will push forward faster without her.” Inga Thompson has been left reeling by his lack of good grace in commenting on her departure. She fears for the athletes she has left behind and how they may be treated.  Marion Clignet, another experienced rider and member of Union Cycliste Feminine, was initially a sport director at Cynisca, but her contract was not renewed in February. Clignet also opposes trans-identified men competing in women’s sports, though Cynisca is keen to emphasise that this is not why she was let go. However, Clignet told Cycling Weekly that she was “treated differently, bullied, ghosted” and that “Inga was ostracised almost from the very beginning”.  Clignet also alleges that she experienced “rude”and “aggressive” behaviour from members of staff — something the Cynisca team has sought to deny. It looks, even from the outside, as though Cynisca is cleansing the team of the political view that men should not compete in women’s sport. In leading the Board in this direction, Gutowsky is not fostering an environment where women will win, but one where men will beat them, and women will be expected to be quiet about it.  Nothing could send a surer signal to young female cyclists than the treatment of Inga Thompson. If you object to men in your cycle races, then you will have your reputation dragged through the dirt of the cycling media.  Is Inga Thompson scared by what has happened to her? Not at all. She told me, “I will do anything to protect women’s sports and to honour the women who came before me who fought to have women’s rights and for women’s rights in sport. If being bullied so badly and defamed so badly gets women’s sport the attention it needs, then being bullied is worth it.”  Thompson is one of that rare breed of women who is willing to stand up for other women even at great personal cost. She is withstanding the abuse she receives for her views and keeping her eyes on the future for young female cyclists. She is braver than Chris Gutowsky in representing their needs and rights. I hope that whilst those vulnerable young female athletes see the backlash she has faced, they also see that if they don’t stand with her, they will lose the right to fair competition. As I have previously stated, it is crucial that male sportsmen begin to speak out on behalf of these women; they have more financial power to exact change and certainly more financial resilience. If, for example, Chris Froome on a salary of over £5 million spoke up, he wouldn’t feel the breeze of cancel culture rustle his bank account in the slightest. By contrast, it is only the established positions of retired elite sportswomen that allow them to take up arms for those young women being cowed by the boards of their teams. The heroine of this story is Inga Thompson, the woman who simply will not shut up and sit down whilst men shove women from their rightful podium place. The cost of saying “NO” to men is steep — the pride felt by women brave enough to say it is priceless.  (Cynisca, Rook and Cycling Weekly were approached for comment but did not offer any.)","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlY3JpdGljLmNvLnVrL2luZ2EtdGhvbXBzb24tYW5kLXRoZS1jb3N0LW9mLXNheWluZy1uby_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Ukrainian officials say their forces shot down 29 of the 30 missiles Russia launched, with the lone survivor striking an industrial target in Odesa and killing one person.  Ukraine's air defenses have become substantially more robust in recent weeks with the addition of U.S.-made Patriot missiles. The defense system has drastically reduced the rate at which Russian missiles strike their targets.  Russia has maintained an unrelenting assault on Ukraine's cities throughout May.

"assassination","1948-10-30","Not Discerned","{""Jejuri"", ""Maharashtra"", ""India""}","Fri 19 May 2023 02:30:15","In April 2023, there arose a set of governmental moves to delete large chunks (in the name of “rationalisation”) from NCERT history textbooks. Kumkum Roy, a former professor of history at JNU, in her recent article in The India Forum, gives a detailed account of the deletions – especially in the section ‘Our Pasts I’ in Class VI textbooks. She notes that any and all references to diversity and socio-cultural difference in India’s deep and complex past are sought to be ironed out. This includes one of Asoka’s edicts which asks citizens to practice tolerance towards persons of other faiths, and try to co-exist peacefully. Crucially, a large part of the subcontinent’s past that involves Muslim rule has been part of such deletion proposals. The renowned historian Romila Thapar wrote in The Wire:  History is based on a continuity of events. It makes little sense to delete large sections of it, as such deletions inevitably confuse both teachers and students. Thus, to jump from the early to the late second millennium AD, and to preferably avoid teaching “Muslim history” can only result in immense confusion. Discussion of the impact of events gets stymied if there are breaks that create huge blanks in the narrative, or else deletions that annul the centrality of discussing an event in order to understand it or observing connections between various actions. Can one really discuss the assassination of a major political leader – in this case Gandhi – without mentioning who exactly the assassin was, what were his possible motives and what resulted as the political aftermath of the event?  Given these comprehensive critiques of the logics of “rationalisation” through which a massive act of public forgetting is being engineered, I seek to look at the practice of public consumption of history itself – its emotional and psychological impact. I wish to examine in this essay, a sense of history through which our everyday life is made possible, considering that the historical imagination is accessed all the time even though most people do not study history in university or go on to become professional historians. I want to go back in time and collect a few historical instances of a syncretic, contradictory sense of India – you may call it Bharat or Hindustan. This idea, M.A. Asif says, existed in rudimentary versions in medieval India, and was definitely not solely an invention of British historians and anthropologists. There is a geographical, cultural, intellectual and aesthetic consensus among court historians on what this entity – Hindustan – might look like. He writes of the historical work written by 17th c. CE historian of the court Adil Shah II, Firishta, in the book The Loss of Hindustan: The Invention of India:  For Firishta’s Hindustan, the intellectual geography has cities such as Ghazni, Kabul, Peshawar, Srinagar, Lahore, Uch, Thatta, Agra, Awadh, Patna, Jaunpur, Dhaka, Gulbarga, Golkonda, Bijapur, Chitor, Ujjain, Patna, Ahmedabad, and Surat, to name the most prominent cities from the tenth to the seventeenth centuries…. We cannot, in any analytical way, divide the histories of these cities along with the lines of ideologies – there is no Hindu period followed by a Muslim period.  This vast expanse of land, needless to say, is diverse and complex. Not only are there many kingdoms, and many kinds of rule – both Hindu and Muslim – the rise of Buddhism and Jainism influenced the social and religious landscape significantly. By the year 1615, when Sir Thomas Roe appeared in the court of Mughal Emperor Jahangir, as a representative of the English king James I, India was an extremely thriving economy and could boast of a composite Indic-Islamic cultural fabric. The historian Audrey Truschke shows in her book The Language of History: Sanskrit Narratives of Indo-Muslim Rule that Jain monks and scholars of Sanskrit regularly found patronage in Mughal courts.  We also know from the comprehensive biography of Dara Shikoh by Supriya Gandhi [The Emperor Who Never Was: Dara Shukoh in Mughal India] – the eldest of Shah Jahan’s sons – who took an active interest in Sufism as well as Indic metaphysical traditions. Significantly, he translated the Upanishads into Persian. Thus, we get a picture of a very cosmopolitan India in medieval times, albeit replete with caste and other hierarchies. It is this contradictory account of a long and complicated history that the textbook deletions seem to want to hide from our children. In so doing, not only do we misinform our children, we also generate a stunted relationship with the concept of the past (or many pasts).  History  Our consumptive approach to the history of India (or the Indian sub-continent) is primarily to neaten and straighten out interlinked, contradictory accounts of our collective, overlapping pasts. My call here is to urge Indian citizens to accept history as subjective, narrative accounts of the past by different people whose perspectives emerged from how they were situated in an era, and within a political establishment. Further, we often impose our contemporary categories – nation-state, state-church divide, secularism – on the past, and end up judging the past as though it were supposed to be an extension of our past.  These attitudes to history and the historical imagination must be corrected in educational institutions (schools included) in order to take the right perspective on the idea of India, as it is embedded in this subcontinent’s – stretching from the Hindu Kush mountains to the Indian Ocean – deep pasts.  What are our relations to diverse realms of our deep past? Deep pasts have laid traces on our collective memory even as we learn the stories of kings and princes and gods and goddesses and wars and festivals from centuries ago. Ram and Sita and Draupadi and Arjun and Krishna form our collective inheritance with which we imagine an India of the deep past – pasts whose temporal measurements are not available to us. They are ingredients of myth, but myth mixes with history in the Indian historical imagination. Historical characters – great monarchs like Akbar and Ashoka – are remembered in almost mythical registers, and the god Ram is remembered through his historically marked birthplace, Ayodhya. Traces of myth generate sacred geographies across the subcontinent for all religions. Diana Eck calls this network “tirthas”, a mytho-geography. Historical characters like the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb or Mahmud of Ghazni are remembered primarily as villains of history for acts such as the desecration of temples like the wealthy, powerful temple of Somnath. Many historical characters can easily be cast in the mould of exemplary goodness or badness. Claiming continuity of our own identity with good or bad characters of history produces pride and/or shame for us in the current time.  Why do we feel the need to take sides with history? Why is it difficult to accept the past with a bit of ambivalence? It rightly concerns us today, but it should not shape our present identity by assuming some king or emperor of the past is ours for the taking. Nor should it give us pride or shame to be of the same ethnicity or religion as some emperor or king who did a right or wrong thing. This ambivalence is important to cultivate in order to render a working political relationship with history. Our relationship with history, in turn, shapes our relationship with political ideologies that determine the present. We will be able to take an attitude of distance and sobriety to many violences of our current times, if we are able to stop attaching historical burdens to present currents of harm and violence. I am primarily talking here about communal, caste and gender violence. Our society and nation are replete with horrific instances of such violence. We render these violences and their implications opaque when we falsely attach them to historical incidents of violence.  Love  Let me transition to telling the story of Bharat or Hindustan not through the dry facts of historical continuity and/or rupture, but through the melodic register of poetry. Love, earthly and divine, features predominantly in any shape of this idea of India. Love for an intimate one as a lover or an admirer is everywhere in literary renditions of Lord Krishna’s leela with Radha, his primary consort, in the Braj region. It begins as early as Jayadeva’s Gitagovinda written in Sanskrit in the 12th century. One finds the early impressions of a character called Radha in the songs of Andal in modern Karnataka as early as the eighth century. Radha and Krishna perform earthly and divine love in assuming an inseparable form in Vaishnava theology that is written by various saints and mystics across the 13th century to the 16th century – including Roop and Jeev Goswami, Madhavacharya, Vallabhacharya, Sri Ramanuj and later poets and mystics like Surdas, Ravidas, Mirabai. The Braj region located in modern Uttar Pradesh, on the banks of the now-heavily-polluted river Yamuna (also widely worshipped as Yamunaji or Yamunarani), grew into a sacred geography that stages Krishna’s adolescence and youth – invoking in the devotee public emotions of dasya, sakhya, vatsalya, madhurya – servitude, friendship, companionship, amour (my translation). This range of emotions are versions of a combined love for the gods, for the community, and for the landscape. Such accounts of individual, social and divine love are found across languages and regions of India. These accounts do not make the history of violence go away.  They instead destabilise history that we learn to parrot through a predictable schema of villains and heroes. These poems and songs across two millenia, collected from across regions, languages and faiths, further show that Indians knew how to love strangers, people and communities who they did not quite understand. It’s the kind of love that in modern, secular language we come to recognise as ‘tolerance’. It is this rich register of love that we are disconnected from today as modern citizens.  I will discuss two poems, both modern, showing a longing for inhabitation of an Indic longtime. I use the word longtime when I could very well have said historical time, but when that is not measured in categories of modern importance like nation, citizenship, war, sovereignty, and so on.  The first poem is a yearning for a lost city, written in the modern era connoting a pain for a Bharat or Hindustan that is lost forever, leaving behind only traces or residues in language and space. These histories cannot be written but in poetry and song.  Magadh by Srikant Verma  Which way lies the city of Magadh?  Listen, O rider of the horse.  From Magadh I come  And to Magadh  I must return.  Which way shall I turn?  To the North of South?  Or to the East of West?  Lo, there lies Magadh!  And now it is gone!  It was only yesterday  That I had left Magadh behind,  It was only yesterday  That the people of Magadh had said.  Do not leave Magadh  I had given them my word.  That before the Sun rises  I shall be back  And now there is no Magadh.  Aren’t you looking for Magadh as well?  Brothers.  This is not the Magadh.  That you have read about in books  This is the Magadh which you  Like me  Have lost forever.  Translated from Hindi by Mrinal Pande. Reproduced from The Bloomsbury Anthology of Great Indian Poems.  The poet here yearns for a place or a feeling called Magadh. Magadh emerges as a signpost for historical amnesia. History allows us a window to keep score and calculate revenge, but this poem underscores an abyss through which a collective, modern agony is accessed.  In the next poem, written in the 1970s (most likely in Bombay because that is where the bilingual poet Arun Kolatkar was based), we find a timeless yearning for god, who is not mentioned explicitly but implied. Politically fuelled history fails us where these poems apply themselves. These poems arise out of a modern abyss – we live in this time making the most rational choices that we can make in our circumstances, when we vote, buy cars, breathe polluted air, protest government policy, all the while feeling a collective pain of a land that is lost to our conscious memory. That belongs to our multifarious gods, that land has fed our ancestors, the lands stands to this day bearing all the environmental violence that we inflict upon. The metaphor of ‘stone’ (implying the deity built in stone) recurs in the poem – the stone, to me, also reflects the mute enduring capacity of the land itself. This collective pain is amplified by the public consumption, erasure and manipulation of history (in textbooks and beyond).  Chaitanya by Arun Kolatakar  sweet as grapes  are the stone of jejuri  said chaitanya.  he popped a stone  in his mouth  and spat out gods  Arun Kolatkar, reproduced from Jejuri, NYRB Classics, 2005.  These poems are highlights of a modern disconnect that the current controversy over textbook deletion exemplifies. We have lost, as a citizenry, a finger on the textures of our past. Magadh is lost not only in geopolitics but in our imagination. The rock or stone that recurs in Kolatkar’s poems are a sign of the everyday lived in a conversation with various forms and iterations of the divine. These are textures of time lost in our current vocabulary. Their traces survive sometimes in the pages of poetry and fiction. They survive at other times in loud protests over this or that historical event that we interpret as sources of our own ignominy or pride. I would choose the former over the latter. As we protest the large-scale deletions of our past from textbooks that tell Indian history to our children, it is important to remember not to own historical names and events in order to take sides in our current political battles.  A version of this article has been published in the Marathi magazine Sarvankash.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vdGhld2lyZS5pbi9oaXN0b3J5L2luZGlhLWhpc3RvcnktY29tcGxleC1zYW5pdGlzYXRpb27SAUtodHRwczovL20udGhld2lyZS5pbi9hcnRpY2xlL2hpc3RvcnkvaW5kaWEtaGlzdG9yeS1jb21wbGV4LXNhbml0aXNhdGlvbi9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Vatican gendarmes fired a shot at the speeding car’s front tires after it rushed the gate, but the vehicle managed to continue on its way, the Vatican press office said in a statement late Thursday.  Once the car reached the San Damaso Courtyard of the Apostolic Palace, the driver got out and was immediately arrested by Vatican gendarmes. The Vatican said the driver was about 40 years old and was in a ""serious state of psychophysical alteration."" He was being held in the Vatican barracks.

Francis lives on the other side of Vatican City at the Santa Marta hotel, where at that hour he would normally be having dinner and retiring to his room. The Vatican statement said that as soon as the gendarmes sounded the alarm of an incursion, the main gate blocking access to the piazza in front of Francis' hotel was shut.

The Apostolic Palace, which houses the papal apartments, key reception rooms, the Vatican archives and offices, is guarded around the clock by Swiss Guards and gendarmes who man various checkpoints.  It's not the first time that someone with apparent psychiatric problems caused a disturbance at the Vatican.

"assassination","2023-10-09","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Fri 19 May 2023 00:01:12","In the contemporary world, it is easy to take for granted the privilege of having a voice. The right to express ourselves, to voice our opinions and concerns, to join in the dialogue on matters that affect our lives. These are fundamental freedoms we enjoy but often do not fully appreciate until they are gone. The profound quote from Malala Yousafzai, ""We realize the importance of our voices only when we are silenced,"" emphasizes this poignant reality.  Malala's journey is a testament to the power of the voice. As a young girl in Pakistan, she used her voice to advocate for girls' education, standing up against the Taliban's oppressive regime. When her voice became too powerful and too influential, she was brutally silenced and shot in an assassination attempt. However, her forced silence only amplified her message globally, evoking a wave of support and bringing attention to the cause she so fiercely advocated.  But how does this relate to us? Most of us are not living under oppressive regimes, and our voices are not under threat of physical violence. But do we truly understand the importance of our voice? Do we use it wisely and boldly, or do we sometimes let fear, apathy, or indifference silence us?  Each of us has unique experiences, perspectives, and insights. When we express these authentically, we contribute to the richness and diversity of thought in the world. Our voice can inspire change, motivate others, and even be a beacon of hope. We all have that inherent power, but the noise and distractions of modern life often obscure it. When we consciously silence ourselves, we lose out on opportunities to connect, grow, and affect change. Our voice becomes potent only when we choose to express it.  Moreover, we should remember that having a voice is not just about speaking; it is also about being heard. It means making a conscious effort to listen to others, to understand their perspectives, and to validate their experiences. In this interconnected world, we can empower each other by recognizing and affirming the value of each voice.  In contrast, being silenced doesn't always mean the absence of speech. It can also mean being unheard, ignored, or invalidated. It is when we find ourselves in these situations of silence that we truly understand the vital importance of having a voice. As Malala's experience has shown us, even in the harshest forms of silencing, the spirit of the message can break through louder and stronger.  However, the goal should be not to wait until we are silenced to appreciate the importance of our voice. Instead, let us realize the power and responsibility that comes with having a voice. Let's commit to using it wisely, confidently, and empathetically, contributing to a world where every voice is heard and valued.  Malala's quote is a poignant reminder and an inspiration for us all. A reminder that our voices are important and that they can be catalysts for change. And an inspiration that even when silenced, the power of a voice can echo across the world. Let us learn from her courage, and never underestimate the potency of our own voice.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8veW91cnN0b3J5LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1L3Bvd2VyLW9mLXZvaWNlLWltcG9ydGFuY2UtcmV2ZWFsZWQtaW4tc2lsZW5jZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2018-03-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Fri 19 May 2023 04:16:00","Antonio Dasiparu/AAP  Sunday May 21 is election day in Timor-Leste, when voters decide on 65 members of parliament to represent them. Each election is a reminder of the successful regional and international cooperation that led to Timor-Leste’s independence. It’s also a reminder of the importance of Timor-Leste as an exemplar of democracy, peace and human rights as foundational values.  It is in Australia’s interest that this be nurtured.  As a small state facing many challenges, maintaining these values has regional and global resonance. Timor-Leste is an important voice both in the Pacific and Southeast Asia. It is a successful state that, despite difficulties, has been able to be peace-loving and sustain relations with Indonesia.  By contrast, democratic regression, or the worst-case scenario of a failed state, would be an enormous setback for the entire region.  What role should Australia play in keeping this democracy strong?  The history of the Australia-Timor-Leste bilateral relationship is complicated. It includes the vital Timorese assistance during the second world war and Australia’s tacit approval of Indonesia’s 1975 annexation. It also includes Australia leading the United Nations International Force East Timor (INTERFET), which in turn led to Timor-Leste’s transition to independence following a referendum in 1999.  The two nations have been complexly intertwined through Timor-Leste’s journey to independence and democratic development.  There have been instances of unease between the two countries. The most notable was the allegation of Australian spying during negotiations on the Greater Sunrise oil fields. This remains an ongoing issue with the potential to derail ties again.  Read more: After a border dispute and spying scandal, can Australia and Timor-Leste be good neighbours?  But there have also been positive steps, such as Operation Astute, an Australian-led military and police deployment. This operation helped stabilise the country during the 2006-2008 political turmoil that culminated in the attempted assassination of President Jose Ramos-Horta and his medical evacuation.  Story continues  In 2018, Australia and Timor-Leste concluded a treaty establishing their maritime boundaries following a United Nations conciliation process.  The complexity of the relationship means Australia needs to be respectful in relations, but it should not stop Australia from being a partner to support Timor-Leste’s democratic processes and institutions.  Australia and Timor-Leste came to a resolution on a maritime dispute in March 2018. Antonio Dasiparu/AAP  A recent report outlines how Australia can support Timor-Leste’s governance in ways that ensure effective, capable and legitimate institutions that are responsive to people.  Australia has a track record of such programs. The eight-year, $72 million Governance for Development Program supported Timor-Leste agencies to develop good policy and improve systems as well as helping civil society engage with government decision-making. The program worked in areas including public financial management, economic policy, enabling business, public service administration, law reform and financial services.  The Partnership for Inclusive Prosperity (PROVISU) will continue to support good governance and economic policy by providing support to Timor-Leste’s central government agencies and economic ministries. Through programs like this, Australia can offer meaningful support to Timor-Leste.  Good governance that responds to citizens’ needs is a perennial problem. Timor-Leste’s nascent bureaucracy makes this a priority issue. Australia should continue to develop partnerships that strengthen institutions so they are able to deal with problems.  An example of this is PARTISIPA, a ten-year $80 million program to improve access to quality basic infrastructure and services. It works in partnership with national and subnational governments to improve the delivery of decentralised services and village-level infrastructure, such as rural water. It continues Australia’s long-term support for the national village development program and its community-driven processes.  Another area where Australia can contribute is in media.  Timor-Leste has a vibrant media landscape that is among the freest in the region. Australian can support Timor-Leste to ensure its media are strong and robust as well as free, with public interest is at its core. It can also work with local media to strengthen their ability to educate the general public on governance issues, to hold power to account and to promote the rule of law.  Australia can help Timor-Leste maintain a vibrant and free media landscape. Antonio Dasiparu/AAP  An example of this is a recent memorandum of understanding between the ABC and Timor-Leste’s public broadcaster RTTL, which includes media development programs. The agreement recognises the vital role both organisations play in informing audiences and contributing to democracy. The ABC will work with RTTL to establish a new English-language news service, helping staff enhance their journalism and content-making skills.  Another priority Australia can engage with is the justice system.  Consultations with Timorese civil society organisations, conducted by The Asia Foundation for the Asia-Pacific Development, Diplomacy & Defence Dialogue (AP4D) report, revealed a particular concern about rebuilding trust in the judicial system. It’s an area with which Australia has not been greatly involved compared to Portugal.  Australia should also engage with Timorese political parties, recognising the important structural role they play in governance. This can complement continued engagement with formal government institutions and the national parliament. Australia should continue to invest in the protection and promotion of human rights.

Finally, Australia should be a partner for youth civic and political engagement, given the reality of a future political transition from independence leaders to younger generations.  Timor-Leste today lives with a legacy of conflict, which has far-reaching implications. There is significant pressure on government to meet the needs and expectations of the Timorese people. Australia can be a partner to support these goals.  By helping to build a stronger, resilient and prosperous Timor-Leste, Australia is investing in a more secure and stable immediate neighbourhood, which will reap mutual benefits.

"assassination","1857-11-11","Not Discerned","{""Savannah"", ""Georgia"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 19:07:12","Cameron Rowland, Depreciation, 2018. Restrictive covenant; 1 acre on Edisto Island, South Carolina  40 acres and a mule as reparations for slavery originates in General William Tecumseh Sherman’s Special Field Orders No. 15, issued on January 16, 1865. Sherman’s Field Order 15 was issued out of concern for a potential uprising of the thousands of ex-slaves who were following his army by the time it arrived in Savannah.[1]  The field order stipulated that “The islands from Charleston south, the abandoned rice fields along the rivers for thirty miles back from the sea, and the country bordering the Saint Johns River, Florida, are reserved and set apart for the settlement of the negroes now made free by the acts of war and the proclamation of the President of the United States. Each family shall have a plot of not more than forty acres of tillable ground.”[2]  This was followed by the formation of the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands in March 1865. In the months immediately following the issue of the field orders, approximately 40,000 former slaves settled in the area designated by Sherman on the basis of possessory title.[3] 10,000 of these former slaves were settled on Edisto Island, South Carolina.[4]  In 1866, following Lincoln’s assassination, President Andrew Johnson effectively rescinded Field Order 15 by ordering these lands be returned to their previous Confederate owners.  Former slaves were given the option to work for their former masters as sharecroppers or be evicted. If evicted, former slaves could be arrested for homelessness under vagrancy clauses of the Black Codes. Those who refused to leave and refused to sign sharecrop contracts were threatened with arrest.  Although restoration of the land to the previous Confederate owners was slowed in some cases by court challenges filed by ex-slaves, nearly all the land settled was returned by the 1870s. As Eric Foner writes, “Johnson had in effect abrogated the Confiscation Act and unilaterally amended the law creating the [Freedmen’s] Bureau. The idea of a Freedmen’s Bureau actively promoting black landownership had come to an abrupt end.”[5] The Freedmen’s Bureau agents became primary proponents of labor contracts inducting former slaves into the sharecropping system.[6]  Among the lands that were repossessed in 1866 by former Confederate owners was the Maxcy Place plantation. “A group of freed people were at Maxcy Place in January 1866 …The people contracted to work for the proprietor, but no contract or list of names has been found.”[7]  The one-acre piece of land at 8060 Maxie Road, Edisto Island, South Carolina, was part of the Maxcy Place plantation. This land was purchased at market value on August 6, 2018, by 8060 Maxie Road, Inc., a nonprofit company formed for the sole purpose of buying this land and recording a restrictive covenant on its use. This covenant has as its explicit purpose the restriction of all development and use of the property by the owner.  The property is now appraised at $0. By rendering it legally unusable, this restrictive covenant eliminates the market value of the land. These restrictions run with the land, regardless of the owner. As such, they will last indefinitely.  As reparation, this covenant asks how land might exist outside of the legal-economic regime of property that was instituted by slavery and colonization. Rather than redistributing the property, the restriction imposed on 8060 Maxie Road’s status as valuable and transactable real estate asserts antagonism to the regime of property as a means of reparation.  ———  [1] Eric Foner, Reconstruction: America’s Unfinished Revolution, 1863–1877, updated ed.

Fighting between Israel and Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Gaza ended after five days, as a ceasefire took effect and appeared to hold late May 13.    Over the course of the fighting, 33 Palestinians were killed in Gaza, including civilians and combatants. Two civilians were killed in Israel – a woman in the central Israeli city of Rehovot and a Gaza resident who was working in a town on the Israeli side of the border.    Islamic Jihad shot more than 1,000 rockets at Israel during the conflict; many that were aimed at populated areas were intercepted by Israel’s missile defense systems, and some fell short in Gaza. Israel conducted hundreds of airstrikes in Gaza, killing six Islamic Jihad leaders.    This round of fighting began on Tuesday, May 9, as Israel assassinated senior leaders of Islamic Jihad, which is designated by the United States and European Union as a terror group. Those assassinations followed a day of heavy conflict between the two sides one week earlier, after a senior member of Islamic Jihad died of a hunger strike in an Israeli prison.    Tuesday’s airstrikes also came after far-right figures in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s governing coalition pushed for a harsher response to the Gaza rockets.    Egypt mediated Saturday’s ceasefire, and a statement from Netanyahu’s office “thanked Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi and expressed the appreciation of the State of Israel for Egypt’s intensive efforts to secure a ceasefire.”    The statement added that Israel would refrain from further airstrikes, as long as rocket attacks from Gaza ceased.    Unlike previous rounds of conflict between Israel and militants in Gaza, Hamas, the group that controls the coastal strip and likewise is designated as a terror group by the United States and EU, appeared to remain on the sidelines. Israel and Hamas have fought several times in recent decades, with their deadliest conflict taking place in the 2014 Gaza War.  — JTA    ","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vamh2b25saW5lLmNvbS9jZWFzZWZpcmUtZW5kcy1pc3JhZWxnYXphLWNvbmZsaWN0LWFmdGVyLWRheXMtb2YtZmlnaHRpbmctcDMxOTc0LTk3Lmh0bdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(WHNT) — U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) is firing back at U.S. Senator John Hickenlooper (D-CO) after Hickenlooper claimed former President Donald Trump politicized the decision to move the U.S. Space Command Headquarters to Redstone Arsenal.  The junior senator from Colorado made these claims in response to an NBC report Monday that said President Joe Biden may prevent Space Command Headquarters move to Alabama over the state’s abortion policies.  Hickenlooper sent out a series of tweets Wednesday, referring to the NBC report, saying “This focuses on the extreme abortion laws in Alabama and Sen. Tuberville’s decision to bar military promotions – a hold that directly affects military readiness.”  He also questioned the validity of the review process.  “The process that led to the initial decision to move space command to Alabama was ‘minimally credible’ and left out key considerations,” Hickenlooper said via Twitter.  Senator Tuberville responded to Hickenlooper’s tweets saying in part “… the facts are clear – and the facts are on Alabama’s side.”  In a statement made Wednesday regarding Senator Tuberville’s decision to block military promotions, Tuberville said “If I thought this had anything to do with it, obviously, we wouldn’t be going down this road. But I believe in life.”  Today just happens to be the 60th anniversary since President John F. Kennedy visited Redstone Arsenal, months before his assassination.  During a recorded video commemorating the anniversary, Senator Tuberville implored President Biden to visit the Rocket City.  “And so today I want to challenge President Joe Biden,” Tuberville said. “Come to Huntsville. See with your own eyes why this is the best place for Space Command. Put politics aside and do what’s right for this country.”  Despite reports that President Biden wants to prevent Space Command Headquarters from coming to Redstone Arsenal, ultimately the decision remains in the hands of the Secretary of the Air Force.  So far, Secretary Frank Kendall has given no timetable for a decision.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3dobnQuY29tL25ld3MvaHVudHN2aWxsZS90dWJlcnZpbGxlLWludm9sdmVkLWluLXR3aXR0ZXItZXhjaGFuZ2Utd2l0aC1jb2xvcmFkby1zZW5hdG9yLW92ZXItc3BhY2UtY29tbWFuZC1oZWFkcXVhcnRlcnMtbG9jYXRpb24v0gGMAWh0dHBzOi8vd2hudC5jb20vbmV3cy9odW50c3ZpbGxlL3R1YmVydmlsbGUtaW52b2x2ZWQtaW4tdHdpdHRlci1leGNoYW5nZS13aXRoLWNvbG9yYWRvLXNlbmF0b3Itb3Zlci1zcGFjZS1jb21tYW5kLWhlYWRxdWFydGVycy1sb2NhdGlvbi9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2023-02-21","Not Discerned","{""NewYork"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 23:06:43","Malcolm X, also known as El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz, was a prominent and influential figure in the American civil rights movement. Born on May 19, 1925, his life was marked by an unyielding commitment to racial equality and social justice.  Early Life  Malcolm Little, who would later adopt the name Malcolm X, was born in Omaha, Nebraska. His childhood was fraught with hardships and violence. His father, a Baptist preacher and supporter of Black nationalist leader Marcus Garvey, was allegedly killed by white supremacists. His mother was institutionalised for mental health issues, and Malcolm and his siblings were placed in foster care.  During his early life, Malcolm faced significant racial discrimination, which influenced his views on race and social inequality. In his teen years, he relocated to Boston and later Harlem in New York City, where he became involved in criminal activities.  Prison and Conversion  In 1946, Malcolm was sentenced to ten years in prison for larceny and breaking and entering. It was in prison where he began a transformative journey. He was introduced to the teachings of the Nation of Islam (NOI), a Black nationalist and religious movement, through his brother Reginald. He began to study the teachings of NOI leader Elijah Muhammad, which led to his conversion to Islam. It was also during this time that he adopted 'X' as his last name, a symbol for the African identity that he felt had been stolen from him and other African Americans due to slavery.  Rise to Prominence  Upon his release from prison in 1952, Malcolm X became a devoted follower and spokesperson for the NOI. His charisma, intelligence, and powerful oratory skills quickly propelled him into the national spotlight. He fiercely criticized the mainstream civil rights movement and its advocates, like Martin Luther King Jr., for their nonviolent approach, arguing instead for racial separatism and self-defense in the face of racial violence.  Malcolm X's philosophy evolved throughout his life. After a pilgrimage to Mecca in 1964, he became disillusioned with the NOI and its teachings. He embraced Sunni Islam and began to advocate for racial harmony, rather than separatism.  Assassination and Legacy  On February 21, 1965, Malcolm X was assassinated while giving a speech in Harlem. His killers were identified as members of the NOI. His assassination marked a tragic end to a life dedicated to challenging the status quo and fighting for the rights of African Americans.  Malcolm X's legacy continues to resonate today. He is often celebrated for his unapologetic critique of systemic racism, his powerful articulation of Black identity, and his advocacy for Black self-determination. His life and work continue to inspire and influence movements for racial and social justice across the globe.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8veW91cnN0b3J5LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1L21hbGNvbG0teC1iaXJ0aC1saWZlLWxlZ2FjeS0xOTI1LW1heS0xOdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The court had granted permission for Anas to testify wearing a mask in open court, with the condition that he reveals his face to the accused person in the judges' chambers beforehand.    The decision was announced in a statement by Tiger Eye P.I, the investigative firm led by Anas, which expressed concerns about the potential risks to his safety and security.    ""As much as Anas is willing and ready to testify for the prosecution, doing so under the condition specified by the court presents a clear and present danger to his security and safety, especially because of the issues chronicled above,"" Tiger Eye said in the statement dated Thursday, May 18, 2023.    The company emphasized that Anas's request for his face to remain hidden stemmed from his role as an undercover agent and the risk that revealing his identity would bring to his safety and security.    ""It should be recalled that the late Ahmed Hussein Suale, a star witness in this case, was assassinated in broad daylight in 2019. His assassination occurred on the same day that he had engagements with the Attorney General's office on his testimony against the accused person in the above-styled case,"" the firm said.

"assassination","2023-05-12","Not Discerned","{""Madrid"", ""Colima"", ""Mexico""}","Thu 18 May 2023 20:50:23","A sixty-year-old longshoreman drowned on May 12 at 4:30 in the morning at the Port of Rosario, in Argentina’s Parana River. His fellow workers responded by declaring a strike. The dockworker, Juan Oscar Contreras, was a night-shift casual worker.  He slipped from on top of a truck that was at the edge of the dock; a temporary bridge had been placed between the truck and the ship that was being unloaded. Other workers immediately lifted him out of the water but could not revive him. The port has no emergency squads, equipment or ambulances.  Port of Rosario Argentina, container yard. [Photo: Claudio Elias]  Workers denounced port authorities over unsafe conditions that exist throughout the facility, and initiated strike action. One worker pointed out that, while there are life vests in the facility, none of them are distributed among the longshore workers. According to one eyewitness, management tried to dress Contreras’s body with a life vest.  Cesar Aybar, head of the local trade union, the Sindicato Unidos Portuarios Argentinos (SUPA), declared: “Sadly, between 4 and 5 in the morning, one of our fellow workers died. We have been denouncing for a long time the way that things are done; the port is not in the conditions it needs to be in, in terms of hygiene and safety.” Aybar said that this was the third dockworker fatality at Puerto Rosario.  The national federation of longshore unions, FEPA, indicated that it was considering a national strike over the worker’s death, which it described as an “assassination,” a result of the port’s negligence. “Our organization totally backs the work stoppage organized by the United Dockworkers of Rosario (SUPA Rosario) and demands an exhaustive investigation on this worker’s death,” it stated.  Both SUPA and FEPA are corporatist organizations with a long history of corruption and betrayal of workers’ struggles. Both organizations are accomplices in what amounts to decades of deterioration in Argentina’s logistical network, of which the ports are an important part. The Rosario Terminal is a major exporter of cereals, sunflower seeds, soybeans, vegetable oils and processed agricultural commodities.  Argentine ports, once government property, were privatized in the 1990s, under the pro-business administration of Peronist president Raúl Ménem. The major ports, such as Rosario, were taken over by multinational agribusiness conglomerates, including US-based Cargill and Bunge, Dreyfus (France), COFCO (China), Glencore (Switzerland), and Vicentín and AGD (based in Argentina). Vicentín is one of the owners of the Port of Rosario Terminal, where Contreras fell and died.  These owners exercise oligarchic control over the ports and their workers. Government agencies keep no independent records of the exports of cereals, oils and other agricultural products; they rely on what the companies volunteer to report.  Argentina’s ports were privatized together with other parts of the country’s logistics supply chain, including railroads and airlines.  The work stoppage takes place in an atmosphere of open rebellion among Argentine workers. In January, Rosario dockworkers ended strike action over the sacking of 25 dockworkers and attacks on wages, along with company-imposed speed-ups.  Other sections of the working class currently carrying out protest strikes and strikes over wages and working conditions include subway workers and educators. Many of these uprisings take on a spontaneous character and are in opposition to the trade union bureaucracies.  On Tuesday, Port of Rosario management refused to meet with a government arbitrator and locked out the port workers. Two hundred trucks have been prevented from entering the terminal, as the company (Valentín) attempts to pit dockworkers against the truck drivers. Port of Rosario Terminal head Leonardo Feltrinelli cynically claimed that Contreras’s death had been merely “a fatality” and gave guarantees that safety procedures had “been verified” by the company.  According to a spokesperson for the SUPA union, “the company refused to give in to the arbitrator’s suggestions and declared that the work would take place as it saw fit.” Describing operations at the port as “very poor” in terms of infrastructure, hygiene and safety, the SUPA bureaucrat called on the provincial governor to intervene.  Neither SUPA nor any of the port unions have called for an extension of the work stoppage at the Port of Rosario Terminal to all the other terminals and ports, isolating the Port of Rosario workers. It now appears that dockworkers will be back on the job toward the end of this week, even though nothing seems to have been resolved.  Argentina is in the midst of an inflationary debt crisis and is very dependent on its export revenues; yearly price increases exceed 100 percent. Its finances have been taken over by the International Monetary Fund which is demanding ever-increasing austerity policies on behalf of national and international vulture funds. These include a drop in imports and attacks on workers’ living standards.  Over 40 percent of the population now subsists below the poverty line. A recent report from the Catholic University in Buenos Aires indicates that, since the pandemic began in 2020 there has been a dramatic increase in youth hunger (among those under 17 years of age) as well as increases in extreme hunger. This, in a nation that continues to be one of the world’s leading providers of agricultural foodstuffs. Increases in government food aid and other programs for the poor are quickly eclipsed by price increases.  Agricultural monopolies play a huge role as the Argentine economy struggles to resolve its financial implosion.  In an attempt to deal with the inflationary crisis, the current administration created a soy-bean-based peso-dollar exchange. Exporters that deposit their dollars in Argentine banks are guaranteed an exchange rate that exceeds the official peso price of dollars. Yet exporters are very much part of the flight of dollars out of the country, routinely depositing their dollar profits in tax-havens across the world.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndzd3Mub3JnL2VuL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjMvMDUvMTgvaml4Yi1tMTguaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Some 24,000 security personnel are reportedly being deployed to Hiroshima during the summit, most dispatched from other parts of the country.    Well ahead of the May 19-21 talks, patrolling police have been weaving between tour groups in the western city's famed Peace Park.    Security personnel were also motoring up and down the river that runs alongside sites like the Atomic Bomb Dome, with helicopters regularly buzzing overhead.    The measures have extended far beyond the city, including to the capital Tokyo, where messages on the train system warn of heightened security for the summit.    Major cities in Japan do not generally have rubbish bins in public places, but security personnel have been sealing off other places considered to pose a potential threat.    Coin lockers, which are common in many stations, have been put out of operation at major stations as far afield as Tokyo.    Vending machines on subway platforms have also been unplugged and sealed with tape, along with apologetic signs warning they will be unavailable during the summit for security reasons.    In Hiroshima, signs across the city and in hotels remind locals and tourists alike that the summit will cause disruption, including the closure of streets and access to the island of Miyajima, which leaders are expected to visit.    - 'Inconvenience understandable' -    Dozens of schools and other institutions have simply opted to close during the summit, according to local media.    But Yoshinari Kakei, who was out walking his dog in the Peace Park early Wednesday evening said he was ""grateful"" for the heavy security.    ""Inconvenience and limitations are understandable. We will just live with that during this period,"" the 52-year-old told AFP.    The measures are likely to be closely scrutinised less than a year after a gunman assassinated former prime minister Abe as he campaigned in the city of Nara.    Then in April, a man hurled an explosive device towards Prime Minister Fumio Kishida shortly before he was due to deliver a campaign speech in the city of Wakayama.    He escaped unharmed, but the fact that an assailant was able to throw the device at such close range so soon after the Abe murder prompted renewed criticism of security arrangements in Japan.    The head of Japan's National Police Agency, and the local police chief, resigned in the wake of Abe's assassination after an investigation confirmed ""shortcomings"" in the security for the former leader.    The investigation slammed a system under which local police were given responsibility for the security of visiting senior officials and argued that with better measures, it was ""highly probable"" the attack could have been prevented.    Kishida has instructed police to step up security around the G7 ""so that guests can visit Japan with peace of mind"".    Leaders from G7 members Japan, the United States, Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and the European Union will be joined by invitees including Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHA6Ly93d3cubXR2LmNvbS5sYi9lbi9uZXdzL2ludGVybmF0aW9uYWwvMTM2MzY0Ni9qYXBhbi1yYW1wcy11cC1nNy1zZWN1cml0eS1hZnRlci1wbS1hdHRhY2tz0gEqaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubXR2LmNvbS5sYi9BTVAvRGV0YWlscy8xMzYzNjQ2?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","1988-11-22","Not Discerned","{""Home"", ""Washington"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 15:23:51","A man who won a staggering £13 million jackpot, branded it a ‘lottery of death’ after he blew through the lot in a matter of months, spent time behind bars, and even survived an assassination attempt from his own brother.  Pennsylvanian William Post III, known as Bud, said he managed to scrape together $40 (£32) after pawning a ring and spent it on lottery tickets back in 1988.  Loading…  His landlady, who was also his on-off partner, Ann Karpik bought an additional 20 entries and one of those 60 tickets turned out to be the jackpot winner.  Advert 10  Post scooped a whopping $16.2million (£13m) and took the option to have it paid out annually, in instalments of $498,000 (£401,253).  With such a healthy sum of money landing in his account each year, you’d think Post would be set for life, but as we've seen before from lottery winners, it didn't turn out like that.  According to reports at the time, Post managed to burn his way through $300,000 (£241,719) of his first payout ‘within weeks’ of receiving it.  And if you’re wondering how he managed to do that, well, despite not owning a pilot's licence, Post splashed out on a twin-engine plane for himself and bought businesses for his siblings.  Advert 10  William Post III, known as Bud, scooped £13m on the lottery.

His money problems weren’t his only worries - his brother Jeffery hired a hitman to try and kill Post and his sixth wife, in a botched attempt to claim an inheritance.  Advert 10  Things continued on a downward spiral for Post; in 1989, one year after his big win, Karpik launched legal proceedings against Post, claiming he had told her they would split the cash and in 1992 she won the case.  Post pawned a ring to buy 40 lottery tickets. Credit: Pexels/Erik Mclean  With his debts mounting, Post sold his mansion and auctioned off the rest of his annual lottery payouts.  What was left of his cash prize, around $2.6 million (£2.09m) , was soon frittered away, too.  Advert 10  But Post’s bad luck wasn’t over yet - in 1998 he was arrested for an assault conviction from six years previous. Post had been convicted after firing a gun at a debt collector who turned up at his home.  Post served his time and came out to a very different way of life - living off just $450 (£362) a month disability payment. He died penniless in 2006 aged just 66.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhZGJpYmxlLmNvbS9uZXdzL3dpbGxpYW0tcG9zdC1paWktYnVkLWxvdHRlcnktd2luLWJyb3RoZXItOTE1MTY1LTIwMjMwNTE40gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","1968-11-22","Not Discerned","{""NewYork"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 10:59:00","Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was once a hero of the environment in New York.  He helped push a fracking ban. As an environmental lawyer, he spent more than three decades fighting for a cleaner Hudson River. He protected New York City’s reservoir in the Catskills. He pressed for the closure of the Indian Point nuclear plant. He founded an environmental group devoted to water protection that has worked on six continents.  That Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is gone.  Advertisement  The long shot presidential candidate and onetime crusader for environmental protections has transformed into a font of anti-vaccine misinformation and conspiracies. That includes promoting false claims about the assassination of his father, former Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, and his uncle, President John F. Kennedy.  “It’s hard not to be sad about it,” said Alex Beauchamp, Northeast region director for Food & Water Watch, who was a Kennedy ally during the years long fight to ban fracking in New York.  “You start to have a couple of crazy views, and then, all of a sudden, you’re a full-blown conspiracy theorist,” Beauchamp said. “I do think it changed; I don’t think he was the same 10 years ago.”  Last month, Kennedy officially launched his bid against President Joe Biden in the Democratic primary. Since then, his poll numbers have been surprisingly strong, reaching as high as 21 percent, according to FiveThirtyEight, a media and poll tracking site. That puts him in a similar position to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in his uphill battle against former President Donald Trump on the Republican side.  The Kennedy campaign did not respond to a request for comment. However, in an interview last month with a New York radio station, Kennedy blamed the media for portraying him as “crazy” and said people would be open to his ideas.  “When they see me, I don’t look like the mischaracterizations,” he said. “It may be that people just want something different.”  Kennedy’s environmental work in New York is the type of resume that climate-minded Democrats could embrace — had he not clouded it with his public persona of the last few years.  Kennedy, with his famous lineage and long career of battling and beating polluters, was a regular presence at the New York State Capitol. He’d stand atop its grand staircase looking down at hundreds of cheering activists hanging on to his every word as he railed against fracking, Hudson River pollution and greedy corporations poisoning natural resources.  But over the last decade, Kennedy’s visits to the New York State Capitol became less about environmental causes and more about attacking the safety and efficacy of vaccines. It’s there where he began to split his time as an anti-vaccine activist and as a climate champion. He would spout discredited claims about vaccines causing autism one day, and then the next, he would be back to the Hudson River protections.  By 2015, Kennedy was using his name to host press conferences where he pushed false claims about vaccines harming children who receive meningitis shots. He wasn’t holding forth on the grand Capitol staircase, however, and in June of that year, he crowded reporters into a small basement room off the Capitol with angry parents who claimed vaccines had caused autism in their children, a thoroughly debunked claim.  Kennedy and his supporters shouted at reporters for hiding the “truth” about vaccines. He flipped over a poster board and began writing, in small, barely legible script, formulas that he claimed proved his point that additives in vaccines were harming children.  Kennedy told reporters that vaccines were “making our children dumber and … giving them injuries.”  It was a difficult moment.  However, Kennedy would take that message and expand on it wildly, traveling to other state capitols to fight against similar meningitis vaccine legislation. Within a few years, he would step down from his long-held positions on some of New York’s top environmental groups, Riverkeeper and the Waterkeeper Alliance he founded. In a resignation letter, he said he devoted himself full time to anti-vaccine causes and conspiracies.  “A series of recent events have aligned my thoughts and feelings and given me the clarity to conclude it’s time to move on,” Kennedy wrote when he resigned from Riverkeeper, the group that he had built up since 1984 to become an environmental powerhouse of water protectors around the country.  Kennedy has traced his attacks on vaccines to his work fighting against mercury pollution from coal-fired power plants. He has said that mothers who believed their children had been poisoned by trace mercury amounts in vaccines attended some of his public rallies calling for tighter regulations on coal plant emissions. He listened to their stories and it convinced him that he should also look at the health industry in the same way he viewed the fossil fuel industry.  In some circles, Kennedy has enjoyed renewed popularity during the Covid-19 era, where more people are open to vaccine hesitancy and conspiracies. He has helped raise millions of dollars for the Children’s Health Defense, which traffics vaccine misinformation as well as the “dangers” of internet cell towers and radiation.  He also has called for the release of his father’s killer, Sirhan Sirhan, who he claimed did not murder his father. In a recent radio interview, he said the CIA could have been involved in his uncle’s murder, a long-running and debunked conspiracy theory.  In the first weeks of his presidential campaign, Kennedy has not rejected climate science, but now claims that climate policy is part of an international conspiracy involving Bill Gates and the World Economic Forum. That type of rhetoric fits squarely with the “Great Reset” conspiracy, which holds that governments will exploit the protocols of the Covid-19 era to force “climate lockdowns,” including forcing people to eat bugs instead of meat.  “Climate issues and pollution issues are being exploited by, you know, the World Economic Forum and Bill Gates and all of these big, you know, mega-billionaires, the same way that Covid was exploited, to use it as an excuse to clamp down top-down totalitarian controls on society,” Kennedy recently told radio show host Kim Iversen, who has also trafficked in conspiracy theories around Covid-19 and vaccines.  Some in New York who fought alongside Kennedy for years feel betrayed.  Kennedy waged so many important environmental battles in New York for so many years that the activist community mostly looked the other way when he started to ramp up his anti-scientific screeds against public health, said former state Assemblyman Steven Englebright (D), who chaired the Environmental Conservation Committee. He said the Kennedy name and the long record of success discouraged people from ostracizing their erratic ally at a time when he alternated between climate and anti-vaccine causes.  “I don’t see that man anymore. From what I see, he’s eccentric at best and maybe disturbed,” Englebright said. “He has lost his way in a direction away from science, and the other word for science is facts.”  The new Kennedy is a purveyor of cherry-picked and junk science who claims public health officials act like Nazis, compares Anthony Fauci to Adolf Hitler and invokes Anne Frank when discussing vaccinations. His own family is horrified at what he is doing to harm the public at large and the political legacy he inherited.  “Bobby’s lies and fear-mongering yesterday were both sickening and repulsive,” Kerry Kennedy wrote on Twitter after her brother referenced Anne Frank. “I strongly condemn him for his hateful rhetoric.”  More recently, Kerry Kennedy has made it clear that the family does not support his presidential run.  “I love my brother Bobby, but I do not share or endorse his opinions on many issues, including the Covid pandemic, vaccinations and the role of social media platforms in policing false information,” Kerry Kennedy said in a statement after he launched his campaign.  Some of his former opponents, however, are thrilled at what they see.  Kennedy once told Marc Morano, a conservative activist who runs a prominent climate denial blog, that those who reject climate science should be held criminally liable and that polluters should be thrown in jail. Now, Morano says, all is forgiven because Kennedy is “undergoing a genuine transformation over his views on the climate agenda.”  He considers the new Kennedy an ally in his fight to sow doubt and distrust around climate science, vaccine research and Covid-19 public health measures.  “I have received some flak from my fellow climate skeptics for being so welcoming and forgiving to RFK Jr., given his hostile history to anyone opposing the climate ‘consensus,’ but I truly believe we are at a pivotal point in U.S. history where we need to realign coalitions to oppose Covid and climate coercion,” he said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVlbmV3cy5uZXQvYXJ0aWNsZXMvcmZrLWpyLWdyZWVuLWhlcm8tdHVybmVkLWFudGktdmFjY2luZS1hY3RpdmlzdC10YWtlcy1vbi1iaWRlbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The head of Ukraine's military intelligence service has said in an interview that Kyiv has assassinated Russian propagandists.  Major General Kyrylo Budanov made the admission to the Ukrainian YouTube channel Rizni Lyudi. According to a translation by the independent Russian-language outlet Meduza, Budanov said that Ukraine had ""successfully targeted quite a few people"" associated with Kremlin propaganda since the start of the war nearly 15 months ago.  Budanov did not provide any names of individuals that Ukraine has allegedly targeted, but several well-known, pro-Kremlin figures have been killed or wounded inside Russia since the start of the war.  Among the more high-profile incidents was last August's car-bomb killing of Darya Dugina, the journalist daughter of Aleksandr Dugin, an ideologue known as ""Putin's philosopher.""  More recently, the prominent military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky was killed by an explosion at a Saint Petersburg café in April, and earlier this month pro-Kremlin writer Zakhar Prilepin was injured in car-bomb attack.  Ukraine had previously denied involvement in the deaths of Dugin and Tatarsky, while Kyiv's security services neither confirmed nor denied having a role in the Prilepin incident.  Though he didn't give more details about Ukraine's involvement in any Russian propagandists' deaths, Budanov told Rizni Lyudi that ""[t]here have been well-publicized cases everyone knows about, thanks to the media coverage.""  On Tuesday, Budanov also spoke to the Ukrainian YouTube channel ISLND TV. During the interview, he hinted at targeting individuals in countries outside of Ukraine, according to a translation by the Kyiv Post.  ""Outright scum will eventually be punished in any country in the world. Only elimination can be a well-deserved punishment for such actions,"" Budanov said, per the Kyiv Post.  He continued, ""I do not consider anything else. It is my personal opinion, I stick to it, and I will implement it.""  Elsewhere in his talk with Rizni Lyudi, Budanov said that the ""Russian army's potential for advancing is completely depleted, but it still has a significant defensive potential.""  ""They've erected a multi-tier defense system,"" he said. ""Still, this isn't the same Russian army that could have been expected to conduct substantial offensive operations.""  Budanov also offered some praise for the Wagner Group of Russian mercenaries and its leader Yevgeny Prigozhin, at least in comparison to the Russian Defense Ministry's formal military forces.  ""Wagner Group is maximally effective; the Defense Ministry's regular army is maximally ineffective,"" Budanov reportedly said. ""Out of sheer envy, the Russian command is trying to undermine and eliminate Wagner Group...The terrible thing is that 80 percent of what Prigozhin says is absolutely true.""  When asked about Budanov's comments, Jason Jay Smart—a political adviser on post-Soviet and international politics—described the role propagandists can play during times of war.  ""The Nuremberg Trials found Julius Streicher, a propagandist, guilty for having driven the German population to wage war,"" Smart told Newsweek. ""Russian propagandists today play a critical role in advancing the Kremlin's narrative across the nation. Removing these vocal supporters of genocide would be a positive for both Ukraine and, ultimately, Russia.""

"assassination","2016-07-16","18:15:00","{""Dallas"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 21:00:00","Ethan Hawke thought the sun had set on the “Before” trilogy before it even hit theaters.  In a discussion with Daveed Diggs for Interview magazine, Hawke admitted that he “didn’t even know” if audiences would care about his trilogy of “Before” films, which began in 1995 with “Before Sunrise.”  More from IndieWire  “It’s not like I don’t want compliments and prizes and money and fire engines. I want everything, but I know how to listen to the river, how to listen to my own voice,” Hawke said. “I remember when I was doing those movies with Richard Linklater, for example, the ‘Before’ trilogy or ‘Boyhood,’ I didn’t even know if they would come out. One part of my brain thought, ‘Oh, people are going to love this.’ And another part of me thought, ‘Nobody’s going to be interested in this.’ I didn’t care. I knew that I was interested in it, and I can hear that voice.”  Hawke added, “But every time in my life I try to sell out, when I’m like, ‘Oh, that’ll be a hit,’ every time I try to do that I fall on my ass. Totally wrong every time.”  The beloved Richard Linklater film “Before Sunrise” later spurred sequels “Before Sunset” and “Before Midnight,” with a fourth film teased as part of an “After” series in 2020. The revolutionary years-long filmmaking tactic for “Boyhood” is set to be replicated for Linklater’s “Merrily We Roll Along” adaptation starring Paul Mescal and Beanie Feldstein.  Hawke noted that, like Linklater, he follows other aspirational figures like Bob Dylan and Spike Lee when standing his ground.  “I always feel like Bob Dylan’s being true to himself and millions of people happen to care,” Hawke said. “Spike Lee seems to always be working for himself and some of the movies hit big and some of them don’t, but you can tell they all kind of mean the same. It’s coming from the same creative force.”  Story continues  Hawke previously shared that Linklater assured him audiences would “care” about “Before Sunrise” as the human connection at the center of the largely-improvised film co-starring Julie Delpy grounded the story.  “‘I don’t want you to worry too much about the script. I’m inviting you to be a filmmaker with me,'” Hawke recalled Linklater telling him. “‘My whole life I’ve gone to the movies and there’s espionage and shootouts and helicopters, all this action. Everything that I see is all this drama, [so much so] that you would think my life, our lives, have no drama. That’s not the way I feel. My life feels very exciting to me and I’ve never been involved in a chase or a gun shootout. My life is exciting to me. And what’s the most exciting thing that’s ever happened to me? Connecting with another human being…If we can put that on screen I think people will care.'”  Hawke summed up in 2020, “Really what he is saying is that we are enough. It’s a hard thing for us, as people, to comprehend that. We are interesting. We are valuable. You are special from the moment you are born. At its essence, the movie is saying people witnessing each other has a huge power. Some times I leave ‘Harry Potter’ or ‘Avatar’ and I feel blue because I don’t have superpowers or magic. But I think Rick’s movies make you realize your life is magic.”  Best of IndieWire  Sign up for Indiewire's Newsletter. For the latest news, follow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

Netflix has unveiled the first look teaser for animated movie Nimona, an action adventure thriller from filmmakers Nick Bruno & Troy Quane (of Spies in Disguise). Originally a production of Blue Sky Studios, a former subsidiary of 20th Century Fox, best known for creating the Ice Age and Rio franchises, it was originally set to be directed by Patrick Osborne, with an initial release date of 2020. Following Disney's acquisition of 21st Century Fox, the production received pushback from Disney's new leadership due to the film's LGBTQ themes, then was canceled due to Blue Sky's closure in April 2021. Annapurna Pictures later revived the project, with Bruno & Quane taking over directing duties, DNEG on the animation, and Netflix releasing it. Nimona, a teenager with the power to shapeshift, is targeted by a knight for assassination. The knight's mission to kill Nimona becomes complicated when he is accused of a crime, and learns that Nimona may be able to exonerate him. Starring the voices of Chloë Grace Moretz, Riz Ahmed, Eugene Lee Yang, Frances Conroy, Lorraine Toussaint, Beck Bennett, Indya Moore, Julio Torres, and RuPaul Charles. Great teaser introducing us to this world & these characters.  Here's the first teaser trailer (+ poster) for Bruno & Quane's Nimona, direct from Netflix's YouTube:  When Ballister Boldheart (Riz Ahmed), a knight in a futuristic medieval world, is framed for a crime he didn't commit, the only one who can help him prove his innocence is Nimona (Chloë Grace Moretz), a mischievous teen with a taste for mayhem — who also happens to be a shapeshifting creature Ballister has been trained to destroy. But with the entire kingdom out to get him, Nimona’s the best (or technically the only) sidekick Ballister can hope for. And as the lines between heroes, villains, and monsters start to blur, the two of them set out to wreak serious havoc — for Ballister to clear his name once and for all, and for Nimona to… just wreak serious havoc. Nimona is co-directed by animators / filmmakers Nick Bruno & Troy Quane, both directors of Spies in Disguise previously. The screenplay is by Robert L. Baird and Lloyd Taylor; story by Robert L. Baird, Lloyd Taylor, Pamela Ribon, Marc Haimes, Nick Bruno, Troy Quane, Keith Bunin. Based on the Graphic Novel by ND Stevenson. It's produced by Karen Ryan, Julie Zackary, Roy Lee. Netflix will debut Nimona streaming on Netflix starting June 30th, 2023 this summer.

(WJTV) – This year marks 60 years since the assassination of civil rights activist Medgar Evers in his Jackson driveway. In June, there will be a week-long commemoration celebrating the lives and legacy of Medgar and Myrlie Evers.  Evers’ assassination was the first murder of a nationally significant leader in the civil rights movement in the country. His death sparked the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  “Medgar, as a as a soldier on the shores of Normandy, fighting against the Nazis, only to return home and fight racism all over again in the form of Jim Crow, the part African-Americans for restaurants, restrooms and voting, and Myrlie Evers in her life, heading the NAACP and really guiding it to a place where it needed to be. I mean, just their lives were just so courageous and and continue to inspire us,” said Jerry Mitchell, an investigative reporter in Mississippi.  At 90-years-old, Myrlie Evers-Williams continues to promote issues of racial equality and social justice.  “And Myrlie Evers just celebrated her 90th birthday, and I saw her speak out in California to a packed crowd on the floor. And she was telling the students, never give up, never give up. And as she’s shown in her life, it’s never too late to do the right thing. And that’s what we see in the story of Black workers, the efforts that it’s never too late to do the right thing,” stated Mitchell.  Freedom Rider Hezekiah Watkins met Medgar Evers as a teenager, but he wasn’t a fan at first because Evers was talking non-violence, which was something he and his friends didn’t want to hear.  “My thing and others was, I’m not going to let you hit me upside my head, and I don’t retaliate. That was our mindset back then, and this was before things really, really got out of hand in terms of the beatings and the murders that took place. I just was not a believer of non-violence,” said Watkins.  However, Watkins said Medgar Evers saved his life when he attended a meeting, and Evers asked the young men about their guns.  “His last question is, ‘Once you run out of ammunition, what are you gonna do?’ We kind of looked around at each other, and then he went on to say, ‘Have you ever seen a dog?’ I’ll never forget this, ‘Have you ever seen a dog chasing a car? That dog bark be so ferocious that he’s going to eat the car up. But once that car stop, that dog relax, and that dog ask himself, what do I do now? That’s what you would be asking yourself when you run out of those little few bullets that you have. What do I do now?’ It puts something on my mind. It really did, and I’m sad. He has a point. You know, once you don’t have any ammunition, what are you going to do?”  Watkins said that’s when he and his friends become non-violent.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndqdHYuY29tL25ld3MvaW4tZGVwdGgtcmVwb3J0cy82MC15ZWFycy1hZnRlci1oaXMtc2xheWluZy1tZWRnYXItZXZlcnMtbGVnYWN5LWxpdmVzLW9uL9IBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndqdHYuY29tL25ld3MvaW4tZGVwdGgtcmVwb3J0cy82MC15ZWFycy1hZnRlci1oaXMtc2xheWluZy1tZWRnYXItZXZlcnMtbGVnYWN5LWxpdmVzLW9uL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2022-02-10","Not Discerned","{""PrinceAlbert"", ""Saskatchewan"", ""Canada""}","Fri 19 May 2023 01:56:00","PRINCE ALBERT, Sask. — A Saskatchewan police chief says he is retiring after a report found officers who responded to a domestic violence call didn’t check on the well-being of a toddler in the hours before the child was killed.  Chief Jonathan Bergen of the Prince Albert Police Service issued a statement Thursday saying the move is in the best interest of the department and the city.  Bergen said he has always held himself accountable for his decisions and been open to scrutiny.  ""What I did not expect from my service and the community I trust and value, is the level of aggressive personal attack and contrived character assassination of me and my leadership team, and the cruel and misdirected emotional assault on my family, orchestrated by a select few  ""Largely the attacks have been cowardly and anonymous. For much of the last three years, it has been very public and relentless.""  The service has been criticized for several incidents in the last few years, with one of them being the killing of 13-month-old Tanner Brass.  The Public Complaints Commission report into the death of the boy, released earlier Thursday, says two officers neglected their duty in the case.  The boy's father, Kaij Brass, has been charged with second-degree murder and his trial is scheduled for next year.  “The circumstances on the morning of Feb. 10, 2022, amount to a tragic and potentially avoidable incident,” the report found. “(Tanner) was, at all relevant times, vulnerable and in danger while inside the residence with (his father).”  Kyla Frenchman, the toddler’s mother, has demanded the officers be fired, alleging she was racially profiled when she called for help. The report found she went willingly to a police station with the officers because women’s shelters were full and there was nowhere warm for her to go.  Her son was left with his father and killed.  The report says Frenchman had called 911 early on the cold winter morning after she walked to an RCMP facility that was closed. She told 911 that her child’s father was intoxicated and had assaulted her.  Story continues  When asked if she was concerned about the child's safety, the report says the mother became emotional and alleged “he hits him when he puts him to bed.”  The two officers arrived six minutes later and spoke with the mother outside the home. She told them the father was intoxicated and had pushed her down some steps.  Frenchman told police she just wanted to get her son and her clothes and wait for a ride to come from La Ronge, more than 200 kilometres north of the city, the report says.  The officers went to the front door and the father came to the window but refused to open the door. Officers later said that they believed he didn’t appear intoxicated and the mother didn’t want to pursue an assault investigation.  The officers determined they had no authority to enter the home or grounds to arrest the father, the report says. They were outside the house for 13 minutes and did not attempt to check on the child.  That was a failure of protocol, the report found. The officers had the authority to enter the home and would have been justified in helping the mother retrieve her belongings and the boy.  The officers also failed to follow the force’s intimate partner violence policy, which requires members “ensure the immediate safety of the complainant and any children who may be present,"" the report says.  Five hours after the mother called for help, the report says, a man called 911 indicating he had killed his baby.  “The totality of the circumstances demonstrates a series of compounded failures by (the officers) when they had a legal duty to investigate the 911 call by (the mother),” the report says.  The report also notes that the officers didn’t take any information regarding the father’s level of intoxication and whether it was safe for the man to be alone with the toddler.  The Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations, which represents 74 First Nations in Saskatchewan, has alleged the officers racially profiled Frenchman and accused her of being drunk.  FSIN Chief Bobby Cameron called for the officers to be held criminally accountable ""for their failure to prevent the death of Baby Tanner.""  The commission’s report says officers were aware the mother was sober but there was no place for her to go. They said she could spend a few hours at the detention centre and she agreed.  Videos from the police car and the detention centre show the mother was not handcuffed and she rested once she was placed in the cell, the report says.  The commission says the force doesn’t have a policy for lodging sober, consenting people in cells, and that places officers in a difficult position when encountering people with nowhere to go and no safe alternatives.  “Officers must either bring sober, consenting persons to cells or leave the person to fend for themselves in the harsh winter,” the report says.  Michelle Ouellette, the commission chair, said the findings were submitted to the police chief to impose appropriate discipline.  Bergen said for the ""sake of integrity"" any discipline must be handled by a new police chief.  Last year, the Saskatchewan government appointed a former Edmonton police chief to conduct an independent review of the force following the child's death.  The review has been completed but Saskatchewan’s public safety minister has not said whether it will be publicly released.  This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 18, 2023.

"assassination","1981-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Woodruff"", ""SouthCarolina"", ""UnitedStates""}","Fri 19 May 2023 03:59:00","May 18—Longtime news broadcaster Judy Woodruff has interviewed the last nine U.S. presidents, but those haven't been her coolest interviews.  ""There aren't many cool people in Washington (D.C.),"" Woodruff said.  The 76-year-old answered questions Thursday afternoon from Shawn Vestal, a Spokesman-Review columnist, and from the Community School students about her five decades of experience covering politics and news at NBC, CNN and PBS.  Woodruff told the roughly 30 students in attendance at the West Central Spokane school that she looks fondly on her time covering former presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan in the 1970s and '80s because it was her introduction to covering national politics.  She said the two presidents were quite different: Carter, a Democrat, was a peanut farmer and Reagan, a Republican, was an actor in Hollywood.  Woodruff was covering Reagan the day he was shot in a 1981 assassination attempt. She said she heard the ""pop, pop, pop"" that everyone thought was the sound of fireworks but quickly realized were gunshots as U.S. Secret Service personnel were screaming for people to get down.  ""It was just the worst kind of thing you'd ever have to cover or want to cover as a reporter,"" she said.  However, Woodruff said she is nostalgic about that time when Republicans and Democrats differed politically but could be seen at dinner with each other.  ""Today, that just doesn't happen,"" Woodruff said. ""The two parties are very far apart.""  Woodruff, who stepped down as PBS NewsHour's anchor in December, is working on a series, called ""Judy Woodruff Presents: America at a Crossroads,"" for the network that examines why the country is so politically divided.  ""It's so funny to me at this stage in my career I'm still finding really, really interesting things to cover because this country keeps changing in many ways, for the better but in many ways that are really troubling,"" Woodruff said. ""Your generation has a lot to figure out.""  Story continues  Woodruff also addressed keys to being a good reporter and the state of media today.  She said reporters should listen and ""prepare like crazy"" for interviews with the expectation that some prepared questions will be thrown out. She said interviewing a president on camera is ""very nerve-wracking,"" but she enjoys the pressure that comes with it. She interviewed President Joe Biden in February.  ""I thrive on pressure,"" Woodruff said.  She said it's becoming more difficult to discern what is true and false in media, and that readers and listeners need to use common sense and look at the source of information to determine its validity.  Woodruff recalled what her first producer said to her as a young reporter: ""No one cares what you think.""  ""It was drilled into me that I was to keep my views out,"" she said.  Woodruff said it's important to the nation's democracy that reporters provide the news ""straight"" and let their audience make up their mind on the topic.  ""I feel very strongly if we don't continue to have straight reporting in this country, it weakens our democracy,"" she said.  Judy Woodruff, a long-time TV journalist and former anchor of PBS Newshour, speaks with students about her distinguished career in TV journalism, Thursday, May 18, 2023, at The Community School. (COLIN MULVANY/THE SPOKESMAN-REVI)  The students in attendance Thursday are working on a project called, ""Lights, Camera, Take Action,"" a KQED Learn ""Call for Change"" challenge that allows students across the country to make videos or audio recordings on topics they're passionate about, said David Egly, social studies project facilitator at the Community School.  Some students told Woodruff about their projects, which included gun control, sex trafficking and sex education in schools, and asked Woodruff for advice on their assignments.  Woodruff told the students to gain a deep understanding for their topics and present them in an understandable and compelling way so people care about them.  Woodruff spoke to students and posed for a group picture with them after her talk.  She told The Spokesman-Review she wants students to know journalism matters, especially now because of the sea of misinformation. Woodruff said if students are curious and willing to work unpredictable hours, they should pursue the career.  ""I think right now that journalism is in a kind of crisis because so much of local journalism has shrunk,"" she said. ""Some places disappeared.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vdGhyaXZlLXByZXNzdXJlLXJlbm93bmVkLWpvdXJuYWxpc3QtanVkeS0wMzU5MDAyOTEuaHRtbNIBVmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vYW1waHRtbC90aHJpdmUtcHJlc3N1cmUtcmVub3duZWQtam91cm5hbGlzdC1qdWR5LTAzNTkwMDI5MS5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","1978-06-05","Not Discerned","{""Vienna"", ""Vienna"", ""Austria""}","Thu 18 May 2023 17:29:54","Helmut Berger, the Austrian actor and regular Luchino Visconti collaborator who become one of the most recognizable faces of European arthouse cinema in the 1960s, has died at the age of 78. The news was announced by the actor’s agent, who wrote that he died “peacefully but nevertheless unexpectedly” on his management company’s website.  Born in Austria in 1944, Berger moved to Rome and began pursuing an acting career after expressing disinterest in following his parents into the hospitality industry. He initially found work as an extra before meeting Visconti in 1964. The “Rocco and His Brothers” director gave Berger a small part in his 1967 film “The Witches,” an omnibus film also directed by the likes of Vittorio De Sica and Pier Paolo Pasolini. Berger and Visconti began a professional and romantic relationship that would go on to shape the European cinema landscape of the subsequent decade.  More from IndieWire  Berger’s most significant roles came in two of Visconti’s next projects: “The Damned” and “Ludwig.” In 1969’s “The Damned,” Berger played an unhinged fictional heir to a steel empire in Nazi Germany who was willing to bend his morals and do business with Hitler in order to fulfill his lusts for money and power (among other things). Three years later, “Ludwig” saw him portraying the infamous “swan king,” Ludwig II of Bavaria, in a film that explored the late monarch’s obsession with extravagance and the opulent lifestyle that eventually saw him declared insane. Both films saw him portraying powerful men with ambiguous sexualities, which helped establish Berger as one of his era’s most notable sex symbols.  He re-teamed with Visconti on the 1974 film “Conversation Piece,” which starred Burt Lancaster as an aging professor who develops a close relationship with a younger man (Berger). Many interpreted the project as an allegory for the close relationship that Visconti and Berger developed over their decade of working together. It was Visconti’s penultimate film before his 1976 death and the final project that the two men would work together on.  Story continues  Berger continued to act until his retirement in 2019, memorably playing the titular role in Massimo Dallamano’s Oscar Wilde adaptation “Dorian Gray” and Frederick Keinszig in Francis Ford Coppola’s “The Godfather Part III.”  Best of IndieWire  Sign up for Indiewire's Newsletter.

PHOTO COURTESY OF CLICKORLANDO.COM  OSCEOLA COUNTY, Fla. — A chapter of a Fla. nonproﬁt organization that helps citizens defend their faith and freedom says that the Osceola County School District acknowledged that a series of books it makes available for children are suitable only for young adults, but refused to pull the books from the shelves.  Citizens Defending Freedom Members in Osceola County are challenging the appropriateness of “Assassination Classroom,” a graphic novel series in which students are tasked with killing their alien teacher, and asking for the series to be removed from the Liberty High School Library.  The group ﬁled for challenges to the books via the School Library Media Advisory Committee.  One of the questions on the form, which was completed by the Media Advisory Committee and returned in response to the challenge, asks, “Is there a preoccupation with sex, violence, cruelty, brutality, and aberrant behavior that would make this material inappropriate for children?”  The School Library Media Advisory Committee answered “Yes” to that question.  Still, the School Library Media Advisory Committee said the books will remain on the shelf, deciding that they were suitable for “young adults.”  In an email to school ofﬁcials, Citizens Defending Freedom executive director on Osceola County Chris Fontenot sent an email to school leadership asking them why books that are suitable for “young adults” would be made available to high-schoolers, most of whom are still children. Fontenot also said that Citizens Defending Freedom plans to appeal the ruling.  Citizens Defending Freedom is no stranger to “Assassination Classroom.”  The group is already challenging the books at the state, asking that they be removed from school libraries.  According to an analysis by Citizens Defending Freedom members, the books contain “explicit violence, mild profanity and sexual activities.”  For example, one illustration in one of the books depicts a group of students aiming guns at their teacher, who appears to be an alien. Other depictions show students pointing weapons with captions such as “GET READY,” and “F-I-I-I-R-E.”  After failing to kill the teacher, and after launching a ﬁrestorm of bullets, one student says, “ALL THOSE BULLETS … AND WE MISSED!?” while two other students say “WE’RE ASSASSINS AND OUR TARGET IS” … “OUR TEACHER.”  BookLooks Review rates the series as “Minor Restricted.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zZmx0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9vc2Nlb2xhLWNvdW50eS1zY2hvb2xzLWRlZW0tYm9va3MtaW5hcHByb3ByaWF0ZS1mb3ItY2hpbGRyZW4tZGVjaWRlcy10by1sZWF2ZS10aGVtLWluLXNjaG9vbHMtYW55d2F50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(Photo by Judy Flores Partlow)  DUMAGUETE CITY – The commanding general of the Philippine Army’s 3rd Infantry Division (3ID) has vowed protection not just for victims and families of atrocities but for next-of-kin of suspected assailants in the Degamo assassination and other Negros Oriental killings.  Major Gen. Marion Sison, 3ID commander, gave the reassurance on Thursday afternoon during the turnover of command of the Army’s 11th Infantry Battalion at its headquarters in Barangay Salag, Siaton town in Negros Oriental.  Sison said this is part of the continued efforts of the military and police to regain the trust and confidence of the people and restore peace and order in the province, which was shaken following the March 4 assassination of Governor Roel Degamo and nine others.  “We will not abandon Negros Oriental, especially now that we have a very challenging task ahead. We will continue with our operations, checkpoints, and the security of victims as well as the families of the assailants until such time that the situation here in the province normalizes,” Sison said.  Sison heads the Joint Task Force Negros, comprising the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police, which was created soon after the Pamplona massacre.  Following their surrender, some suspects in the Pamplona massacre had appealed to the military and the police for the safety of their families as they vowed to cooperate in the investigation.  Some families have already been secured by law enforcement agencies.  Sison reiterated that they would protect both the families of victims and suspects caught in the middle of the conflict.  Sison’s statement also comes as the Senate Committee on Public Order and Dangerous Drugs has wrapped up its inquiry into the brazen attack against the late governor at his Pamplona residence where he was distributing government aid to beneficiaries.  The Senate hearings also looked into many other killings in Negros Oriental in previous years that are still unsolved to this day.  Meanwhile, the Army general presided over the turnover of command of the 11th IB from outgoing commanding officer, Lt. Col. Roderick Salayo, to his successor, Lt. Col. Michael Aquino.  Sison commended Salayo for the battalion's accomplishments during his two-year stint, noting among other things the surrender of Communist insurgents who have already been reintegrated into mainstream society and are enjoying the benefits of the government's Enhanced Comprehensive Local Integration Program.  On the other hand, he challenged Aquino to continue the gains of his predecessor in running after the remaining New People’s Army rebels, especially in the dismantled Southeast Front operating in southern Negros.

"assassination","2023-01-04","Not Discerned","{""Gaza"", ""Gaza"", ""GazaStrip""}","Thu 18 May 2023 15:47:55","In its latest act of aggression against the besieged Gaza Strip, Israel dealt a severe blow to the resistance movement Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ). High-ranking commanders, including the majority of the members of the group’s military council in Gaza, were assassinated in rapid succession during the battle.  These targeted killings sought to weaken the PIJ’s leadership structure and disrupt the organization’s command and control. However, despite these setbacks, the PIJ pulled some new tricks out of its hat, managing to expand the range of its missile strikes, which reached as far as Tel Aviv.  To gain a deeper understanding of these strategic PIJ developments and its advancements in retaliatory strikes, it is important to examine two significant past military operations: “Black Belt” (2019) and “Breaking Dawn” or “Unity of Fronts” (2022).  Learning from the past  Those two battles were triggered by the killing of prominent leaders in the PIJ’s military wing, the Quds Brigades, which appears to have further emboldened Israeli occupation forces in their policy of targeted assassinations. From Israel’s perspective, the perceived political gains outweighed the costs incurred during these two rounds of conflict.  In November 2019, following the assassination of Quds Brigades commander Baha Abu al-Ata, the fighters responded recklessly without proper planning. Rocket launchers were emotionally fired immediately after the assassination, making the missile unit vulnerable to Israeli detection.  As a result, the Quds Brigades suffered significant losses, with around 27 missile force staff members, including three field commanders, being killed. This battle also had a secondary, more dangerous consequence: It established an Israeli policy of singling out a specific resistance group, leaving the PIJ to face their fate alone without the participation of other key resistance elements like Hamas.  During the 2022 “Unity of Fronts” battle, a similar fate befell the Quds Brigades following the arrest of PIJ leader Bassam al-Saadi. Although they fired over 400 rockets at Israeli settlements in retaliation and employed improved tactics compared to the previous battle, Palestinian public opinion fell victim to Israeli propaganda.  The Israelis’ narrative portrayed the PIJ as endangering the lives of two million people in the Gaza Strip – and neglecting the plight of 4,500 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails – for the purpose of securing the freedom of just one person. Furthermore, when some errant rockets fell in Gaza due to technical errors, doubts were raised about the PIJ’s ability to successfully wage war independently.  Trying new tactics  But on 9 May, a significant shift occurred in the conflict. Despite the initial heavy blow from Israel’s first strike, which resulted in the loss of three prominent PIJ leaders – Khalil al-Bahtini, Tariq Ezz al-Din, and Jihad Ghanem – the movement’s response was purposefully delayed for approximately 35 hours.  This unusual stalling tactic confused Israeli calculations. During the brief lull, discussions were held between the PIJ, Hamas, and other resistance factions to ensure coordination and readiness for the upcoming fight. On 10 May, “Operation Revenge of the Free” was launched, as announced by this Joint Operations Room.  The PIJ’s initial missile response unfolded in three stages. The first stage employed a “dumping and neutralization” tactic, focusing on Israeli settlements bordering the Gaza Strip within a 15-kilometer range. These targets included Sderot, Nahal Oz, Nativ Ha’atsarah, and Kerem Shalom.  The resistance’s aim was to first deplete the batteries of Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense system. Following this, missile barrages were launched at about 30 cities, reaching depths of 20 to 75 kilometers into Israeli territory. Targets included Ashkelon, Ashdod, Beersheba, and extended all the way to Tel Aviv, Rishon Lezion, and Palmachim. By the end of the first day, the Quds Brigades had fired approximately 400 rockets.  Discussions in the joint command center  Amidst these developments, discussions were ongoing in the Joint Operations Room, while reports in the Arab and international media hinted at an imminent ceasefire. Egyptian news channels reported that Cairo’s intelligence efforts had led to a truce agreement between Israel and the Joint Ops Room.  This aligned with the Israeli security establishment’s assessment that the scale of retaliation would not surpass what was witnessed in the 2019 and 2022 rounds. The Israeli assessment viewed the PIJ as incapable of waging a prolonged battle, even with the involvement of smaller military factions such as the Al-Nasser Salah al-Din Brigades of the Popular Resistance Committees, The Martyr Abu Ali Mustafa Brigades of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the National Resistance Brigades of the Omar al-Qasim Forces, and the Mujahideen Brigades.  Informed sources reveal to The Cradle that Egyptian intelligence did indeed reach an agreement of sorts with the leadership of Hamas, as a representative of the Joint Ops Room, on the first day of the conflict. However, a deal did not take place because it excluded any significant achievements for the Palestinian resistance.  During this time, Egyptian mediators attempted to establish contact with PIJ Secretary General Ziyad al-Nakhala, but he did not respond to the call. Subsequently, a phone conversation took place between Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas’s political bureau, and Nakhala. Then, at approximately 7:00 p.m. on 12 May, the Quds Brigades responded to the Egyptian proposal by launching a series of missile strikes targeting Israeli cities.  ‘Deterring’ the Resistance  Despite the ongoing and surprising resilience displayed by PIJ, a statement on 14 May by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu boasted that the balance of deterrence had been altered in Israel’s favor:  “Since Guardian of the Walls [Sword of Jerusalem or Sayf al-Quds], Hamas has not fired a single rocket into our territory. They are deterred. Operation Guardian of the Walls dealt Hamas the hardest blow in its history and caused a change in the deterrence equation and it has been working for two years now.”  “Our intention in Operation Shield and Arrow was to change the balance of deterrence against Islamic Jihad. The difference comes not only because of the targeted assassinations that we have been doing for the 16 years that I have been prime minister, but that we did so so calmly and effectively. We took down half of Islamic Jihad’s leadership in a surprise blow, and the other half during the operation.”  Assassinations: A failed policy  Despite the heavy losses suffered in the initial strike, the subsequent days of fighting proved equally devastating. Israel continued its targeted assassinations, eliminating key figures such as the commander of the missile force in the Quds Brigades, Ali Hassan Ghali, and his deputy, Ahmed Abu Daqqa, followed by the assassination of Operations Staff Commander Iyad al-Hassani on the fourth day.  Remarkably, after each targeted killing, the Quds Brigades intensified its missile strikes and introduced new tactics into the battle. This had the effect of shrouding the Israeli ground forces, which had misread the PIJ’s capabilities, in the fog of war.  The Quds Brigades employed tactics such as utilizing suicide drones, anti-tank missiles, and launching intensive mortar attacks. Its intention was clear: to demonstrate through firepower and brute force that the policy of targeted assassinations had not diminished its effectiveness in the field.  Not taking the bait  A source in PIJ tells The Cradle that the Quds Brigades leadership had carefully analyzed the lessons learned from the previous two battles. According to the source, Israel’s objective was to provoke another “emotional reaction” from the Brigades, through heavy firepower. To counter the Israeli tactic, the Brigades have focused on strengthening the discipline of field fighters. “The instructions were clear: do not shoot and wait for orders.”  This discipline led to an expansion of the area of missile launch sites, which reduced the effectiveness of Israel’s technological monitoring of the firing points, and weakened the possibility of identifying and targeting them.  The source explains: “When we decide to launch 50 missiles, we do so from 10 launch points, although we are able to launch them all from one or two points. By doing so, we preserve the safety of fighters and launchers.”  According to Israeli statistics, PIJ alone fired about 1,500 missiles, “which completely paralyzed the cities of the south, and caused the evacuation of 12,000 settlers,” killing an Israeli and a foreign worker, and injuring 77 others, in addition to hundreds of minor injuries and panic attacks.  These numbers, according to Palestinian researcher Ismail Muhammad, show that the PIJ was able, during only a 10-month interim between operations “Unity of the Fronts” and “Revenge of the Free,” to rebuild its missile stockpile and to address all previous technical problems. As Muhammad tells The Cradle:  “Despite the losses at the command level, no significant field losses were recorded. Four field fighters from the artillery unit and the armor unit were martyred, while the losses in the missile unit remained zero.” “The continued firing of missiles at the same pace until the last moment indicates that that the assassination of the commanders did not affect the effectiveness of the field, and that the Brigades were able to assign new commanders, whom Israel described after the bombing of the city of Jerusalem on the last day as crazier than their predecessors.”  Down but not out  Shortly before the ceasefire took effect, PIJ launched over 120 rockets targeting Ashkelon, Tel Aviv, Palmachim, Rishon Lezion, and Rehovot. This was an attempt by the PIJ to remind Israelis that its military capabilities remained intact and plentiful and that it retained the upper hand, even though the ceasefire deal did not accurately reflect PIJ’s gains on the ground.  During the ceasefire negotiations, the PIJ was successful in persuading mediators to include the phrase “stop targeting individuals” in the agreement, signaling a halt to assassinations. However, it is widely acknowledged that Israel is unlikely to honor this commitment.  The military assessment of Operation Revenge of the Free is that it allowed the Quds Brigades to increase the cost for Israel by singling out PIJ cadres. Despite the loss of six commanders, a source confirms to The Cradle that the Brigades appointed new commanders during the battle who effectively resumed operations without missing a beat.  Predictably, Israel has already deviated from the spirit of a ceasefire by supporting the controversial Flag March of Jewish extremists through East Jerusalem, assisted and emboldened by the presence of 3,200 Israeli security forces. This visceral challenge to Palestinians represents a crucial test not only for PIJ but also for all resistance factions that have pledged to disrupt Israel’s provocative actions in Jerusalem.  The Flag March aims to project a false “image of victory” for Netanyahu and restore Israel’s deterrence – something he failed to achieve during the five-day confrontation with the second most powerful organization in the Gaza Strip in terms of strength and military capabilities, and arguably, the most militant and uncompromising in its armed struggle for national liberation.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlY3JhZGxlLmNvL2FydGljbGUtdmlldy8yNDk3Ny9waWpzLXRhY3RpY2FsLXRyaXVtcGgtbWlzc2lsZXMtbXVsdGlwbHktZGVzcGl0ZS1sb3NzZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","1987-10-12","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 21:44:00","Listen 4 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share  Nearly 30 years ago, while serving in the Senate, Joe Biden told an interviewer that “if Haiti just quietly sunk into the Caribbean, or rose up 300 feet, it wouldn’t matter a whole lot in terms of our interests.” Now, as president, Mr. Biden has crafted a policy — or lack of one — that reflects that indifference. He has done so even as Haiti, the Western Hemisphere’s poorest country, is seized by its worst security, political and humanitarian crisis in decades, one the United Nations recently likened to war.  Haiti’s ineffectual government has begged for international intervention. U.N. Secretary General António Guterres has issued repeated urgent appeals for a specialized armed force to stem the violence, restore some semblance of rule of law and establish conditions for holding elections, which are impossible amid the current anarchy. The international community’s response has been a shrug.  Haiti is a failed state whose collapse, accelerated by its president’s still-unsolved assassination almost two years ago, has generated tens of thousands of migrants desperate to reach the United States. In the absence of a functioning government, and in the face of a crumbling national police force whose members are gunned down in the streets, gangs have run riot over the capital city of Port-au-Prince and elsewhere.  Advertisement  The incidences of killings, rapes and kidnappings have soared. Street violence is ubiquitous, and children are frequently among the victims. Sophisticated, high-caliber arms and ammunition, much of it smuggled from the United States, have fed the spiraling mayhem. The illegal drug trade has exploded. Recently, the vacuum in government authority has given rise to vigilante violence against suspected gang members, some of whom have been gunned down and burned to death in the street.  Follow this author Editorial Board 's opinions Follow  In a country that has long struggled to feed itself, the pandemonium’s humanitarian fallout is cataclysmic. In a recent report, the U.N. characterized life in Haiti as a “daily, terrifying struggle for survival.” Within the population of roughly 12 million, nearly 5 million people have difficulty feeding themselves, and almost a third of Haitians live on less than $2.15 a day.  The Biden administration, seeking to impede Haitians who make their way to Mexico from crossing the U.S. border illegally, has established a so-called humanitarian parole program. Under its provisions, U.S. residents who meet certain criteria can apply to sponsor a Haitian immigrant to enter the country legally for a limited period. But the program has been plagued by misinformation and technical glitches. Many Haitians who have managed to use it are health professionals, whose exodus has contributed to the country’s deterioration in public health.  Advertisement  Haiti’s long and checkered history of international interventions has justifiably led skeptics inside the nation and elsewhere to be wary of a new effort by outsiders to bring order. U.S. Marines built infrastructure in Haiti during a roughly two-decade intervention early in the 20th century but also were guilty of appalling racism. In this century, U.N. peacekeepers tamped down political violence but also reportedly sexually exploited and assaulted Haitian women and girls. Other U.N. troops introduced cholera into the Haitian water system through poor sanitation at one of their bases; the result was an outbreak that killed some 10,000 people and sickened hundreds of thousands.  Notwithstanding those shameful experiences, there is no plausible escape from Haiti’s meltdown in the absence of international intervention. A broad coalition of civil groups and political parties in Haiti has called for a new national unity government that would prepare the way for elections. But internal divisions among those groups, and the plain reality that there is no domestic force that can grapple with the street gangs, have produced political paralysis.  The likelihood of such political dysfunction was all too apparent in the aftermath of Haitian President Jovenel Moïse’s assassination in July 2021. But the extent of Haiti’s misery since then has exceeded even the grimmest predictions.  Advertisement  Both the Biden administration and the Canadian government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have refused calls to organize an armed intervention. France has similarly demurred, despite its own role in impoverishing Haiti, first through exploiting Haitian natural resources as a colonial master in the 18th century, then by imposing forced reparations that lasted over half a century. Nor has the Organization of American States shown the interest or capacity to arrange such an intervention.  The byproduct of the world’s callous apathy is painful to behold — a country, unable to fend for itself, in an accelerating descent into agony.

"assassination","1965-02-21","Not Discerned","{""NewYork"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","Fri 19 May 2023 04:02:42","Reddit Email 16 Shares  By Joseph R. Stuart, Brigham Young University | –  May 2023 marks 98 years since the birth of civil rights leader Malcolm X, formerly Malcolm Little.  Malcolm X was a spokesperson for the Nation of Islam, or NOI, and helped to lead the organization until he left in 1964 – the year before his assassination.  The NOI, whose role in civil rights movements is a focus of my research, included leaders such as Elijah Muhammad and Louis Farrakhan, who along with Malcolm X are known for their fiery rhetoric and teachings on race.  The NOI, which teaches a Black supremacist message and advocates for racial separatism, has also been labeled a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.  While the organization once boasted half a million members, the group is now relatively small. Currently it has an estimated membership of roughly 35,000 – but prominent NOI members, such as boxer and onetime Malcolm X friend Muhammad Ali, attracted wide public interest in the movement. Today, its influence continues to extend well beyond its membership.  Although Malcolm X – and other prominent members like Ali – left the NOI, thousands of students each year learn about the group from Malcolm X’s “Autobiography,” originally published in 1965.  Malcolm X’s influence on popular culture also remains significant. He inspired a Hollywood biopic and is referenced in the work of artists such as Beyoncé, Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg, who was briefly associated with NOI.  Netflix: “Blood Brothers | Malcolm X & Muhammad Ali Official Trailer | Netflix  Thanks largely to Malcolm X, the NOI is now a household name, but its teachings remain controversial, particularly among Muslims.  A radical alternative to Christianity?  W.D. Fard, a peddler by day and preacher by night, established the NOI in 1931 in Detroit, Michigan.  He taught that God was a Black man who taught the first human beings Islam. Accordingly, Fard framed Islam as “the natural faith” for people whose ancestors came from Africa, before colonization and slavery had forced Christianity onto them. He argued that Black people should abandon Christianity in favor of Islam as their ancestral religion.  Fard also taught that Christianity was “the white man’s” religion and a corrupted form of Islam used to promote white supremacy. The message appealed to Black migrants from the South, who were sometimes looked down upon by Northern Black Protestants. Fard disappeared from the historical record in the mid-1930s.  Malcolm X and the NOI  Malcolm X joined the NOI while incarcerated in 1952. He became an international spokesman for the group, using his fierce wit and sense of humor to debate Black and white leaders on matters of race, religion and politics.  Malcolm X was suspended from the NOI in 1963 for his comments about President John F. Kennedy’s assassination. The following year, he renounced the NOI, converted to Sunni Islam, completed the hajj and formed a Black civil rights organization called the Organization of Afro-American Unit, or OAAU. This group sought to unite all Black people across the globe and conditionally accepted help from white people committed to Black freedom. The NOI, on the other hand, focused on the U.S. and refused all help from white Americans.  Malcolm X was assassinated on February 21, 1965, during an OAAU event in New York. The identity of his killers remains a mystery.  A new era  When Elijah Muhammad died in 1975, his son, Warith Deen Mohammed, transformed the NOI into the “World Community of al-Islam in the West.” He downplayed previous teachings about Black supremacy and aligned the movement closer to Sunni Islam. In 1977, however, a protégé of Elijah Muhammad’s and Malcolm X’s named Louis Farrakhan “restored” Elijah Muhammad’s Nation of Islam. Farrakhan assumed leadership of the group and emphasized Elijah’s teachings on race.  W.D. Fard, the NOI’s founder, and his successor Elijah Muhammad did not seem to know much about Sunni or Shiite Islam’s teachings. Fard did not cite the Quran to his followers, and Elijah Muhammad did not read the book until after assuming the NOI’s leadership.  As the group grew after World War II, Muhammad and other leaders became more familiar with mainstream Islamic tenets. They changed the name of their meeting places from “temples” to “mosques” and incorporated the Quran and Arabic phrases into their teachings and community organizing.  While the movement has changed its practices to align more closely with global expressions of Islam, many Muslims do not consider the NOI part of the Ummah, the global community of Muslims.  Not universally considered Muslim  The NOI’s unique theology is one of the reasons the group is not accepted into the Ummah.  Other forms of Islam maintain that God is eternal, nonhuman and singularly divine. The NOI, however, teaches that W.D. Fard was “God in person” who called Elijah Muhammad as his prophet.  Despite this significant deviation from mainstream forms of Islam, the NOI follows four of the five pillars of Islam: five daily prayers (salat), giving alms to the poor (zakat), pilgrimage to Mecca (hajj) and a month of fasting during Ramadan.  NOI Muslims did not practice Ramadan until 1988, when Farrakhan instructed members to fast “with the entire Islamic world.”  Changing attitudes?  That change led to opportunities for intra-Muslim cooperation but also underscored the limited acceptance of the NOI that continues among many other Muslim groups.  For example, in 2000, NOI members prayed with Houston Muslims during Ramadan, allowing the NOI to connect with other American Muslims.  However, these cross-Muslim events have not continued in Houston. Nor are they common elsewhere. The lack of sustained pan-Muslim events might suggest that, even when religious practice aligns, there remain obstacles to the building of relationships between mainstream and NOI Muslims.  While both the NOI and Malcolm X remain controversial, for many admirers X’s work has taken on new significance for today’s racial justice movements.  Joseph R.

Johnson said Kanu had, on May 12, 2021, traveled to Nairobi, Kenya, as a British citizen and was legally admitted. And that on June 19, 2021, agents of Nigerian government abducted him and tortured him for eight days before his illegal rendition to Nigeria.  Johnson’s letter, which was dated May 10, 2023, and marked, ‘Re: Appeal for Your Urgent Intervention in Urging the Government of Nigeria to Release Nnmadi Kanu from his Extraordinary Rendition, was made available to The Guardian, yesterday, by special counsel to IPOB leader, Aloy Ejimakor.  Stressing that time is of the essence, the US lawmaker said: “There is now growing fear/concern that the Muhammadu Buhari administration intends to assassinate or cause Kanu’s disappearance before May 29, when it plans to hand him over to the incoming administration.  “For months now, it is public knowledge that Kanu’s health condition has deteriorated. He suffers from a serious heart condition and other ailments for which he is not getting enough medical attention.  “Appeal to the Nigeria Government to release the IPOB leader dated back to June 27, 2021.”  Describing Kanu as the leading advocate of Igbo struggle for self-determination, Johnson further stated that his persecution by the Nigerian government has intensified since 2015, when he (Kanu) visited Nigeria from London, the United Kingdom.  He further stated: “First, few days after his arrival, on October 14, 2015, he was arrested in Lagos by agents of the Nigerian government.  “He was held in solitary confinement by the Department of State Security (DSS). Ultimately, he was granted bail by the Nigerian courts.  “After his release, he resided primarily in his ancestral home in Abia State, Nigeria, with his parents, siblings and other extended family members.”  “On October 10, 2017 to October 14, 2017, the Nigerian military attacked and invaded his home. In the process, dozens of people were killed, many were injured and maimed, while many others were captured alive and have disappeared.  “Fortunately, Kanu escaped the invasion and returned to his London residence to reunite with his nuclear family.  “On May 12, 2021, he traveled to Nairobi, Kenya, as a British citizen and was legally admitted into the country.  “On June 19, 2021, he was abducted by agents of the Nigerian government.

A veteran Wall Street executive told CNBC that he has been helping bankroll Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s anti-vaccine group and has become an informal advisor to the organization.  Mark Gorton, founder and chairman of high-frequency trading firm Tower Research Capital, said he has given $1 million to the anti-vaccine nonprofit organization called Children's Health Defense since 2021.  Kennedy, a longtime vaccine critic and a son of late senator and U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, founded Children's Health Defense. The younger Kennedy was also chairman of the group's board before he launched his run for president as a Democrat in April.  While President Joe Biden is the clear favorite to win the 2024 Democratic nomination, Kennedy has drawn a surprising amount of support, with a recent Fox News survey showing that 19% of the Democratic primary voters surveyed would back him in the primary.  Polls also show that Kennedy's rise in influence coincides with an increase in skepticism about vaccines, despite scientific evidence that the shots are safe. Kennedy has attracted support from some longtime political players, including former Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich, who is running the campaign. Michael Flynn, former President Donald Trump's national security advisor, was reportedly pictured with Kennedy in 2021, according to ABC News.  During an almost 90-minute interview at Cafe Fiorello in New York, Gorton said he is cheering on Kennedy's campaign for president and has repeatedly met with him since he donated to Children's Health Defense.  ""I like him a lot. He's a super smart guy. Again, he's not really a politician. He's a corruption fighter,"" Gorton said, adding that he has Kennedy's cell phone number.  Asked about Gorton's donation, a spokeswoman for the Children's Health Defense said in an email, ""CHD's donor information is confidential and only communicated to the IRS in compliance with their rules/regulations.""  A Kennedy campaign spokesperson did not return requests for comment before publication.  The Associated Press reported that Children's Health Defense played a key role in pushing back on Covid vaccines and helped elevate Kennedy's profile. The nonprofit's most recent publicly available tax documents show that it raised just over $6 million in 2020, the year the Covid pandemic started, more than double what it raised a year earlier.  The organization sent CNBC its tax documents from 2021, which show the group raised just over $15 million that year. It went into 2022 with over $11 million in assets. The documents don't name the group's donors.  Beyond his donation, Gorton said he's been talking to the nonprofit's staff through Zoom calls, and advising the group on its messaging strategy. ""I basically have been working with them to try and develop a strategy to go after the core of the beast which is the pharmaceutical industry,"" he said.  Federal Election Commission records show that Gorton donated $500,000 last year to a super PAC that was then called the People Pharma's Movement and run by other Kennedy allies. That PAC rebranded as American Values 2024 and has spent over $200,000 in print ads backing Kennedy's candidacy, according to FEC records.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTgvd2FsbC1zdHJlZXQtZXhlY3V0aXZlLXJmay1qci1hbnRpLXZhY2NpbmUtZ3JvdXAuaHRtbNIBWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDIzLzA1LzE4L3dhbGwtc3RyZWV0LWV4ZWN1dGl2ZS1yZmstanItYW50aS12YWNjaW5lLWdyb3VwLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Of the people killed this year, 68 have been women.  Carlos Jaramillo Silva, president of Tijuana’s Business Council, says the high murder rate continues to generate a bad image for the city.  “This draws a lot of attention, it’s a crisis even though there’s a lot of work going on to lower the homicide rate,” he told the El Sol Newspaper in Tijuana.  Jaramillo is calling for a new strategy when it comes to fighting crime on the streets.  “We need to know what every police agency is doing, we can’t have all of them essentially doing the same thing,” he said.  He also said the high murder rate has yet to have a “big negative impact on attracting new business and investments to the city,” adding that he is concerned with the growing problem of extortion, when businesses are forced to pay cartels a tariff to stay in operation.  Tijuans had more than 2,000 homicides in 2022. According to figures published by the state prosecutor’s office, the city recorded 2,014 homicides in 2020. In 2019, a little more than 2,200 homicides were recorded in Tijuana, well short of the 2,499 in 2018.

First of all, permit me to say I was impressed by your uncompromising honesty. It was truly impressive. Not everyone would be willing to admit to himself – much less to a 4-year-old girl whom his country murdered in cold blood when it assassinated her father – that “my conscience is clear, little girl.”  To be clear, everyone knows you aren’t the only Israeli Jew whose conscience isn’t bothered in the slightest by my deliberate, planned assassination. But you went out of your way to tell me this in writing, so that I wouldn’t, heaven forbid, comfort myself with the thought that my death might trouble your sleep.  'When Trump said F**K Bibi, it wasn't a slip of the tongue' Subscribe 0:00 -- : -- 15 Skip 15 seconds backwards Play audio 15 Skip 15 seconds ahead 1 X Change playback rate from 1 to 1 Mute audio  Granted, I’m only four years old – or more accurately, I was four years old when you “sent a pilot to launch a missile at my bed during the night and destroy me and my dreams,” as you so nicely put it. But I’m already old enough to understand what a conscience is. And you have to be an exceptional person to do something dirty but have your conscience remain clean.  So allow me to tell you, Avri – now that I’m dead, you’ll allow me to call you Avri? – that you, the Jews, are all exceptional. No stain clings to you. Not to you and not to the Israel Defense Forces, which manages to be the most moral army in the world no matter what you do. You aren’t just a light unto the nations; you’re truly bleach unto the nations.  In your letter, you told me that I came to you while you were trying to fall asleep, in the confusion of a dream. In other words, you saw me as a human being – like you, like your daughter. You actually wrote, “I saw her for a moment on the news, holding some kind of school certificate, a proud look on her face, like children the world over, like my daughters.” You wrote that my face was engraved on your heart, and I asked you “laish,” which means “why” in Arabic.  Ostensibly, everything that ought to rouse your conscience was taking place in your heart. But your conscience? It slept the sleep of the just. It isn’t working anymore. It’s broken. Can an entire nation be broken just like an individual can?  From your letter, it’s completely clear that you know this was a deliberate act – that your country didn’t kill me and my mother by accident, but intentionally. It’s clear to you that your country understood my life was the price that had to be paid to assassinate my father, the wanted man, and it decided it was worth it. You clearly know that I’m a child, that I didn’t do anything, that my only crime was being born “to the wrong family, the wrong father.” (Why? Who are you to decide that I was born to the wrong family?).  But then it all collapses into a warped rationalization that frees not just you as an individual, but all of you, from responsibility for your actions. Once upon a time, you still searched for a ticking bomb to justify pinpoint assassinations. Today a ticking watch is enough to justify a non-pinpoint assassination. The explanation that satisfies you, the story you tell yourselves, is all that’s needed for you to justify murdering a 4-year-old girl.  “I view your death as I do the unnecessary death of an Arab child who was killed with his criminal father in a car,” you wrote. It’s “heartrending, but it’s not directly connected to me.” How simple. You put together a few sentences and free yourselves of responsibility. “Your ‘laish’ should be directed at him, after he finishes looking for the virgins that aren’t there,” you write at the end.

'When Trump said F**K Bibi, it wasn't a slip of the tongue' Subscribe 0:00 -- : -- 15 Skip 15 seconds backwards Play audio 15 Skip 15 seconds ahead 1 X Change playback rate from 1 to 1 Mute audio  “Ghosts of Beirut” (on Showtime in the U.S., on Yes and Sting TV in Israel beginning Saturday) is a four-part series that reconstructs the hunt for Imad Mughniyeh, who headed Hezbollah’s apparatus of terrorist attacks. Mughniyeh, who was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Western, Israeli and Arab civilians and security personnel, began to operate toward the end of the 1982 Lebanon War and was assassinated, according to reports, in a joint Israeli-American effort in Damascus in February 2008.  The series is a docudrama: a dramatization of events of the past, generally sticking to the facts and interspersed with short documentary footage, including interviews with some of those involved.  Open gallery view Imad Mughniyeh (standing on the right) in 'Ghosts of Beirut.' Credit: Sifeddine Elamine/SHOWTIME / yes  Issacharoff (full disclosure: he’s a close friend and in the past a co-author) says that the writers allowed themselves creative freedom only in regard to a small portion of the plot. The reconstruction drew mostly on investigations and on interviews with intelligence personnel in Israel and the United States, along with a number of participants from the Arab side.  The original plan was to create a documentary film, but it turned out that many of the central figures involved are unwilling or unable to be interviewed openly. “We met with a large number of operations and intelligence personnel, including handlers of agents. Some of them are people for whom deviousness is a way of life. They mislead you quite a bit in interviews, mainly to blur methods of operation,” Issacharoff relates. The writers drew on the aid of experts on Mughniyeh and on Hezbollah, among them Dr. Shimon Shapira, a retired brigadier general.  Mughniyeh, as depicted in “Ghosts of Beirut,” is a person of unusual skills, daring, intellect and force of leadership, but who also displayed extraordinary cruelty. He personally tortured William Buckley, the CIA station chief in Beirut in the mid-1980s, extracted from him secrets that exposed agents being run by the Americans in Lebanon, and afterward sent a video documenting the torture to Buckley’s friends.  Following 16 months of brutality inflicted on him, Buckley died in captivity, and his body was handed over to the United States. That was the event, along with his part in the hijacking of a TWA plane to Beirut in 1985, that made Mughniyeh a target for the administration. The hunt took two and a half decades, during which Mughniyeh was placed on the FBI’s list of most-wanted terrorists.  The first two episodes of the series trace Mughniyeh’s rise, when he was in his early twenties, during Israel’s invasion of Lebanon. The first major terrorist incident that Mughniyeh helped plan was the suicide attack on the building housing the Israeli administration in Tyre – the so-called “first Tyre disaster” – in November 1982. For years Israel claimed that the explosion in the building was due to a gas leak, despite convincing evidence that it was, in fact, the first suicide bombing in the region.  It was Mughniyeh who recruited the terrorist who perpetrated the attack, his distant relative Ahmad Kassir, the driver of the booby-trapped car. Kassir’s brother is today a high-ranking figure in Hezbollah. Last year, Shin Bet director Ronen Bar announced a renewed internal investigation of the event, in light of the demand by the bereaved families and former Shin Bet employees to declare the disaster an act of terrorism.  The last two episodes leap ahead in time to 2007, when new progress was made in the pursuit of Mughniyeh. The murderous operative appeared once more on the Americans’ radar following an incident that took place in northern Iraq. Iran, angry at the arrest of four members of its Revolutionary Guards by the U.S. Army, tasked Mughniyeh with carrying out a revenge operation in which American soldiers were kidnapped and murdered. Subsequently, the CIA linked up with the Mossad and Military Intelligence, which used a technological and operational breakthrough to tighten the surveillance of Mughniyeh.  The major problem was that Mughniyeh was very cautious and avoided all personal exposure. For years, the intelligence services hunting him weren’t even sure if they had an authentic photograph of him. According to the series – and here Issacharoff doesn’t reveal what is reliable information and what is solely the fruit of imagination – patterns of activity were identified before Mughniyeh’s trips from Lebanon to Syria, where he would meet periodically in Damascus with Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the commander of the Revolutionary Guards’ Quds Force.  The third participant in the meetings was a Syrian general, Muhammad Suleiman, who was killed in an Israeli assassination operation in northern Syria about six months after Mughniyeh, as divulged in U.S. National Security Agency documents. As for Soleimani, the Americans assassinated him in January 2020 in Iraq; according to some reports, the U.S. was assisted in the operation by intelligence supplied by Israel.  Open gallery view Avi Issacharoff (left) and Lior Raz at a convention in January. Credit: Tomer Appelbaum  Cherchez la femme  In the days before Mughniyeh arrived in Damascus, there was a noticeable stirring in the activity of the logistical and operational envelope that preceded his arrival in the city, and that was intended to protect him from assassination attempts. Concurrently, similar movements were discerned around Soleimani, who maintained a somewhat more prominent public profile. But what gave away Mughniyeh’s location on the eve of the assassination was a family crisis.  Mughniyeh had a lover, a Syrian woman, and his wife, who lived in Lebanon, found out about her. According to the series, intelligence agents intercepted a conversation in which Mughniyeh tells one of his sons that he has brought his wife to Damascus for a reconciliation.  Israel recruited the United States for the operation, but encountered two objections: American apprehension that booby-trapping his car would cause casualties in an adjacent school, and a refusal to attack Soleimani on the same occasion. (The Americans’ demurrer is especially interesting now, against the backdrop of the killing of nine Palestinian civilians in the latest assassination operation in the Gaza Strip last week, and the Israeli claim that the U.S. is less cautious than we are in regard to the killing of civilians.)  Open gallery view Qassem Soleimani, assassinated in 2020. Credit: Office of the Iranian Supreme Leader  According to the same reports, the prime minister at the time, Ehud Olmert, flew to Washington to persuade the White House that the Mossad was capable of making a commitment that no innocent individuals would be hurt in the explosion.  The fourth and final episode reconstructs in detail the assassination itself, including the forgoing of the opportunity to assassinate Soleimani and Suleiman, both of whom, as noted, were later killed. In 2015, in an assassination operation on the Syrian border in the Golan Heights, Israel also killed Jihad Mughniyeh, Imad’s son, who together with the Iranians tried to form a Hezbollah squad in the southern Golan.  Last week, Israel assassinated six of the top-ranking figures in Islamic Jihad. Despite the decision-makers’ intense self-congratulation, they were ultimately local operatives whose elimination is not expected to bring about any considerable change in the strategic picture in Gaza. In the past there were, by contrast, Israeli assassinations, primarily in Hamas (Ahmed Yassin, Abdel Aziz Rantissi, the failed attempt to assassinate Khaled Meshal), which were aimed at a higher level. Those actions were considered controversial, and it was claimed that targeted assassinations mainly spur revenge efforts by the adversary.  The case of Mughniyeh is different, and can apparently be listed together with two other strategic assassinations: that of Soleimani and the assassination, which is attributed to the Mossad, of Islamic Jihad leader Fathi Shikaki in Malta in 1995. In those three cases, the target was so central to his organization that his elimination severely disrupted its activity in the years that followed. The countries that decided on the assassinations viewed them as worthwhile actions, as they caused damage to the terrorist organizations’ capabilities for a lengthy period.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oYWFyZXR6LmNvbS9saWZlL3RlbGV2aXNpb24vMjAyMy0wNS0xOC90eS1hcnRpY2xlLy5wcmVtaXVtL2ZhY3Qtbm90LWZpY3Rpb24tZmF1ZGEtY3JlYXRvcnMtdGFja2xlLXJpc2Utb2YtaGV6Ym9sbGFocy1hcmNoLXRlcnJvcmlzdC1tdWdobml5ZWgvMDAwMDAxODgtMmZmOC1kOTE0LWFmOGMtYWZmZDgwNGIwMDAw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

He assassinated Mahatma Gandhi at a multi-faith prayer meeting on January 30, 1948, when Gandhi Ji visited the then Birla House in New Delhi for a prayer meeting.  Godse fired three bullets at the chest of Gandhi ji from a close range, ensuring his death. He chose not to escape and was arrested, tried and sentenced to death. It was his third attempt to assassinate Gandhi ji. Earlier in 1944, he had made two attempts to kill him, but were unsuccessful. He was not alone in the assassination conspiracy; he had plotted the assassination with Narayan Apte and six others.  After the 1948 assassination, Godse claimed Gandhi favoured the political demands of British India's Muslims during the partition of India of 1947.  Godse was born into a Konkani Brahmin family from Baramati, Pune. He got his name Nathuram after his parents forced him to wear a nose ring as they feared that their family was under a curse where their male child died at infancy. He had three brothers and a sister, with all of three boys dying in their infancy.  His parents sent him to study at an English-language school in Pune after he completed his fifth standard education at a local school in Baramati.

The SFJ is a banned terror group under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. The video was recorded on April 5 and released on Thursday. Through a separate Press statement issued on Thursday from New York, the outfit has opposed G20 summits in Jammu & Kashmir.  Besides being sheltered in the US, the SFJ is also backed by Pakistan’s ISI and the latest exhortations could be a bid to revive so-called Khalistan movement here in India following the dismantling of the secessionist network with the arrest of a host of alleged Khalistani leaders like Amritpal Singh and his cohorts, counter-terrorism experts said.  The outfit also gave a call to the Kashmiris to block the Srinagar airport to sensitise the delegates through holding of G20 meeting in Srinagar.  The SFJ is a rootless entity in terms of popular support and its leaders are spearheading the so-called Khalistan movement for earning their livelihood from their masters in the Pakistan Army and the notorious spy agency Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), analysts said.  The Centre is hosting the G20 tourism working group meeting under India’s presidency between May 22 and 24.  The SFJ is headed by Gurpatwant Singh Pannun who is facing several cases on terrorism charges but is living freely in the US without any action from the law enforcement agencies there despite the American Government claiming to fight terrorism worldwide.  The US preaches Pakistan and other countries to rein in terror groups but is itself harbouring such groups. American server service provider Cloudflare Inc is known to host the websites of several UN-banned terror groups like the Lashkar-e-Tayyaba and Jaish-e-Mohammad on the one hand and the ISI on the other, the analysts said.  The SFJ has also launched a dedicated email site for the Kashmiris to send emails urging the G20 ambassadors to “Boycott Kashmir Summit” and “Save Kashmiri Pundits”.  The Save Kashmiri Pundits” could be a ploy to target them through the Pakistani terror cohorts during the G20 summit and run a propaganda overdrive against the Government, the analysts said.  In its bid to scare the member countries of the grouping, the SFJ has also written a letter to G20 countries with the dubious claim that the agencies here can orchestrate violent incidents in Jammu and Kashmir.  In its letter to the G20 countries, the SJF dubbed the abrogation of Article 370 as “annexation by the Modi Government.

The Armenian media allegedly mentions that Pashinyan, returning from the meeting in Brussels, faced an assassination attempt against himself and his son.  This information mentioned about Pashinyan is also similar to the scenario of Karen Demirchiyan, who had been assassined in 1999 in the Armenian parliament. Some sources even mention that Pashinyan wants to make himself a hero. Supposedly, because there are conspiracies against him, Pashinyan is trying to insure himself in order to deny his promise in the future.  Turkish political analyst, professor Husameddin Inac, in a comment for Azernews on the issue, evaluated this chaos in the Armenian society as follows: “Pashinyan is currently in a very difficult situation. In fact, since he was defeated in the 44-day war, he is somehow thinking of signing peace. But, unfortunately, he cannot accept this either in his country, or due to pressures of members in his government and even society.”  The expert, who approaches the issue from the prospect of both Russia and the domestic audience, noted that currently Russia is not an interested party in Armenia's rapprochement with Azerbaijan. Because, according to Inac, the settlement of Azerbaijani-Armenian relations means the end of the mission of Russian peacekeepers in Karabakh. This does not leave the need for Russia to be a joint mediator. According to Husameddin Inac, another issue is related to the so-called artsakh in Karabakh.  “If we look at it from a historical point of view, there was no state called ""artsakh"". Everyone knows that Karabakh is historically the territory of Azerbaijan and no so-called state can be a matter of discussion.  Armenia accuses Azerbaijan by inventing various excuses. Allegedly, they claim that if Azerbaijan starts the great retun to Karabakh, it will carry out ethnic cleansing against the Armenians there. This is a completely fictitious claim. However, Mr. Ilham Aliyev said that the population could only under the condition of accepting Azerbaijani citizenship. They will have the same rights as other citizens and will live in peace and tranquility. Unfortunately, since this condition did not satisfy them, they falsely spread a series of fake news in the media about the oppression of Armenians by Azerbaijanis. And now they also want to blame Pashinyan for what he has only done right in Brussels.""  At the same time, Husameddin Inac touched upon the protests that took place in Karabakh after Pashinyan's meeting in Brussels.  ""If we look carefully at the processes, we will see that after Pashinyan's meeting in Brussels, the protests by separatists in Karabakh started to become more active. This is not only the influence of the separatists, but also of the foreign forces that reign over Yerevan. I think that direct and sincere dialogue between Azerbaijan and Armenia will not be possible as long as this influence is on Yerevan. First of all, Yerevan should take control of the separatists in Karabakh and dissuade them from empty claims as possible,"" the political analyst said.  ---  Follow Rena Murshud on Twitter: @RenaTagiyeva  Follow us on Twitter @AzerNewsAz","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF6ZXJuZXdzLmF6L2FuYWx5c2lzLzIxMDAwMS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"assassination","1993-04-10","Not Discerned","{""Johannesburg"", ""Gauteng"", ""SouthAfrica""}","Thu 18 May 2023 08:13:22","I was about to set off to the airport on the morning of 10 April 1993 to cover the great American boxer Muhammad Ali’s arrival in Johannesburg when the news came through: Chris Hani had been murdered.  Of all the African National Congress (ANC) leaders I’d met during a decade of underground membership during the 1980s, the one who impressed me the most was Hani.  From 1987 to 1992 Hani was chief of staff of the movement’s military wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe, and leader of the South African Communist Party from 1991 to 1993. Intelligent, brave, warm and witty, he exuded the kind of energetic charm that made him a hugely compelling revolutionary. I spent time with him in 1987 and 1989 and felt then, and later, that he would have made a far better successor to Mandela than the anointed dauphin, Thabo Mbeki.  The news of his assassination outside his home in Dawn Park, Boksburg, came as a shock. I found it difficult to focus on the appearance of Ali, who’d been a kind of hero of mine for more than 20 years.  In his recently released book, The Plot to Save South Africa, journalist and author Justice Malala does a masterful job of telling the tale of Hani’s murder and the precarious spell that followed before his funeral. He describes the nine days that followed, days that contained the potential to scupper fragile negotiations to end apartheid and prompt prolonged chaos or worse.  The subtitle of this book – “The week Mandela averted civil war and forged a new nation” – is appropriately chosen.  The book is a gripping read for anyone interested in late 20th century history, and in the end of apartheid more specifically. Malala has done a fine job in making this not just an impressively researched record, but also a compelling, fast-moving tale.  Narrative balance  Malala, who was a young reporter at The Star at the time of the killing, is a talented story-teller, adept at weaving the required facts into a page-turning narrative. Each anecdotal vignette comes with the kind of vivid descriptive detail that is only possible with exhaustive research. He interviewed scores of the key players from all sides in this drama. He also had access to a wealth of archival material, allowing him to delve into the minds of the protagonists and to recount their movements, what they were wearing and the words they shared with each other.  He draws on his experience, discipline and flair as a writer to maintain the momentum all the way through to the funeral at the end.  The key player in this enthralling story is Nelson Mandela who had been released after 27 years in prison in February 1990. He adored Hani, treating the 50-year-old as his son. He was overwhelmed with sadness. But he retained the clarity of purpose to hold back ANC supporters from wrecking the negotiations to end apartheid that had started soon after Mandela’s release, and had resumed shortly before Hani’s murder, after a spell of suspension.  The assassins wanted the talks derailed. They hoped Hani’s death would ignite a civil war that would unleash the apartheid security forces against the ANC and the Mass Democratic Movement, an alliance of anti-apartheid groups, as never before.  There was indeed an outpouring of rage, grief and violence following the murder. In the areas around Johannesburg and Pretoria alone 80 people were killed and hundreds injured in violence directly related to Hani’s assassination, with many more casualties in the rest of the country.  Most of the injuries and fatalities were due to the actions of the apartheid security forces and right-wing vigilantes.  But the outcome of the assassination was the opposite to the killers’ intentions. The incendiary climate following the murder focused minds on both sides. Mandela, his lead negotiator Cyril Ramaphosa, and other ANC leaders successfully used the moment to press for an election date and a Transitional Executive Council to run the country until the first democratic election. This was hugely significant. It meant that the then ruling National Party, the party of apartheid, could no longer call the shots before the election.  Without the urgency injected into the negotiations process by the assassination, it is possible that it would have dragged on, and many more would have died.  The outcome was the opposite to the killers’ intentions. Immediately afterwards, power leaked away from the state president, FW de Klerk, the National Party and the security establishment, and flowed to Mandela, the ANC and the Mass Democratic Movement.  In his accounts of these killings Malala retains narrative balance, giving space to all of the players. For example, he devotes several pages to the murder by ANC activists of the liberal anti-apartheid teacher and activist Ally Weakley, who was tragically mistaken for a right-wing vigilante.  A far-right plot  The book starts with Mandela receiving news of the murder and quickly segues to the movements of the two men who would be convicted, the Polish immigrant Janusz Walus, who pulled the trigger, and his mentor, the Conservative Party MP Clive Derby-Lewis, and also those who assisted them, including Derby-Lewis’s wife, Gaye, and the journalist Arthur Kemp, who supplied Hani’s address (and subsequently emerged as a leading player in the international extreme-right).  Later, Malala raises the possibility that others within the apartheid security forces were aiding them. For example, the regular police investigating the murder were instructed by the Security Police not to probe into Walus’ links to his employer, the arms trader Peter Jackson. Jackson owned the car the killer used on the day, and Malala notes that the killer’s diary disappeared from the police docket, later reemerging with several pages missing.  He also points to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission finding that Walus operated as a source for the National Intelligence Service (the apartheid state’s version of the CIA). The commission probed human rights abuses by the apartheid state and those who fought against it.  To maintain the hour-by-hour tension, Malala avoids reaching ahead, instead portraying the players in this drama as they were then. Perhaps inevitably, some of those who star in his account fared less well in the decades that followed – in particular the ANC spokesperson Carl Niehaus, who confessed to fraud and was eventually expelled from the ANC.  More generally, many of the devoted ANC leaders who played a central part in the build-up to Hani’s funeral went on to become multi-millionaires, more interested in self-enrichment than the common weal.  Appropriately, Malala resists the temptation to speculate about what would have happened if Hani had lived.

"assassination","0064-10-15","Not Discerned","{""Moscow"", ""Moscow"", ""Russia""}","Thu 18 May 2023 16:41:31","Roman Emperor Domitian is remembered for only one joke. “It’s a terrible thing to be an emperor,” Domitian said, “because everything thinks your paranoia about being assassinated is groundless—until you’re actually murdered!” Soon after Domitian was assassinated. Extreme vigilance is the essential mood of tyranny, which must inhabit that condition not just first because it is indeed in danger of overthrow and surrounded by enemies but also because it requires its people to be fearful and isolated, therefore conditioned for extreme solutions. President Vladimir Putin is living proof of this conundrum.  The recent drone attack on the Kremlin may have been the work of Ukrainian or internal Russian factions, possibly within his own wider security organs, or a ‘false flag’ operation by the regime itself, but it was inevitable that the dictatorship would claim it was an assassination attempt on Putin. This is absurd since everyone knows that the president does not live in the Kremlin but outside Moscow in his gilded mansion, Novo-Ogaryovo. Yet Domitian would sympathize because Putin has every reason to fear assassination.  It is a cliché of the cliché-ridden Western press on Putin—and his predecessors Stalin, Peter the Great, Ivan the Terrible—that they are paranoid to the extent of madness. It is a cliché that ignores and misunderstands the nature of dictatorship particularly in Russia. All absolute systems in world history depend on coercion to crush opposition and maintain power, thereby creating internal enemies who can only use violence to overthrow the ruler. All such systems deploy war and xenophobia to inspire and control their own people which creates another legion of enemies. The Western press always emphasizes the omnipotence of the autocrat in a system without limits without seeing that a system without limits means the leader exists in a permanent state of carnivorous chaos without any real or lasting security. Systems without clear rules of succession grant enormous power to the ruler but also mean they have no means of retirement. In Russia—whether under Tsars Ivan IV and Peter I , Stalin or Putin—rulers could appoint their successors but could never do so without creating a potential present menace.  In October 2011, during the Arab Spring revolutions, Putin spent hours watching the gruesome smartphone footage of longterm Russian ally, Colonel Gadaffi, who was sodomized with a bayonet before being shot. Putin resolved to save his ally, Bashar al-Assad in Syria. And himself. He no doubt reflected on the nature of Russian tsardom. He was aware of it from the start: when Yeltsin offered him the presidency in 1999, Putin hesitated, asking “how will I protect my family?” The answer? To establish a dictatorship and keep it for life.  More from TIME  Read More: Putin’s Path to War in Ukraine  Every wise tsar knows that his constant poise must be ferocious vigilance. Peter the Great set the standard of the all-talented emperor and supreme commander to which Putin—along with every other Russian ruler—aspires but he faced constant plots against his life which he handled himself by personally torturing and executing thousands of mutinous musketeers; he even tortured his own rebellions son Alexei to death. Peter invented modern Russia—even its name Roosiya was coined by him—as a new empire; he took the title imperator. The state has never developed from that vision. But this imperial self-image also sets a perilous standard for Peter’s admiring successors: the tsar – whether president or general-secretary—is also a military commander.  If a Russian ruler cannot dominate the “Russian world,” he will disappoint history. Peter was overwhelmingly successful in his wars—but even he was nearly captured and defeated by the Ottomans. Yet the dream of every Russian ruler is conquest. In 1904, Nicholas II’s Interior Minister V.K. Plehve, supposedly advised, “What this country needs is a short victorious war.” Every ruler (even in our democracies) aspires to one of those. Nicholas II instead faced a disastrous defeat vs Japan; but Putin built his imperial presidency and garnished his swaggersome overconfidence with a run of three ‘short victorious wars’ in Chechnya, Georgia and Syria. But they were minor skirmishes; Ukraine is proving very different…  Out of the last twelve Romanov emperors, six died violently. Ivan the Terrible and Stalin died in their beds by wreaking such havoc around them that no one dared destroy them. Putin is a killer but not yet a mass killer on their scale.  Circa 1700, Peter the Great (1672 - 1725), Tsar of Russia, beheading one of the rebel Streltsy (semi-professional musketeers) in front of his nobles. Hulton Archive-Getty Images  In June 1762, the new young Emperor Peter III—puny grandson of Great Peter—threw away costly Russian gains against Prussia. His own Guards and his wife Catherine the Great overthrew him; the Guards strangled him. The press release announced he had died of haemorrhoids. When Catherine later invited the French philosopher d’Alembert to Russia, he joked “I must decline because I suffer from haemorrhoids which are a fatal disease in Russia.” After midnight, on 11th March 1801, Russian Emperor, Paul, son of Catherine and Peter III, was awakened by footsteps on the stairs of his Mikhailovsky Castle; he hid behind a tapestry as the conspirators—slightly drunk after a pre-homicidal champagne—burst into his bedroom.  The conspirators were let in by trusted servant; they were led by his chief minister & top generals; and backed by his own son, who waited downstairs. What happened next was history’s most savage liquidation of a Russian autocrat.  Paul, inconsistent and menacing, was destroyed by war , capricious foreign policy—including sending an army to attack British India. The conspirators saw his feet peeping out of the wallhanging and dragged him out; conspirators hit him with a golden snuffbox, knocking out an eye, then threw themselves onto him, shattering his head on the floor, strangling him with his sash, then drunkenly stomping his head to pulp.  Just over a century later Nicholas II was not killed by his generals but he was overthrown by them. Yes the crisis was accelerated by hungry crowds in the capital Petrograd but contrary to popular history, he was forced to abdicate by his generals when he was isolated in his railway carriage on his way to put down the revolution.  Putin knows all this history. “How will history remember me?” he kept asking historians in recent years. His isolation during Covid made him one of history’s most dangerous creatures: the omnipotent history-buff. Stalin read history obsessively and collected a huge library—half of which is in Putin’s Kremlin office. Before the war, Putin liked to ask visitors to chose a book then together they would examine Stalin’s pungent marginalia. He is not an intellectual like Stalin but he reads historical biographies—including a famous Russian biography of Paul and my own biography of Catherine the Great and Potemkin. History matters to him; he has always been obsessed by eighteenth century Russian leaders, Peter, Catherine and Prince Potemkin. They were the trio who dominated Ukraine; all subsequent Russian-Soviet leaders including Lenin and Stalin regarded the possession of Ukraine as essential to their vision of Russian statehood.  It was Peter who founded St Petersburg and won the Baltic. It was Catherine in partnership with her brilliant lover, co-ruler and secret husband, Prince Potemkin, who conquered Crimea in 1783 and south Ukraine 1787-91, founding the cities Sebastopol, Odessa, Kherson that form today’s battlefield. When I wrote that first book in 2ooo, Putin, waiting for it to be translated, asked for a one-pager on Potemkin’s conquests and cities. In his speeches and essays before invading Ukraine, he cited Catherine and Potemkin. When his troops took Kherson, they captured Potemkin’s tomb and when they retreated late last year, they stole the Prince’s body. I predict that Putin will create a splendid tomb for Potemkin in Moscow to prove the Russian claim to Ukraine.  But the history also shows what happens when tsars fail. In 1964, Khrushchev was fortunate that he was only overthrown and retired after he risked nuclear war and delivered an unprecedented national humiliation in the Cuba Missile Crisis—though his successor Brezhnev did propose his assassination.  Victory makes a Russian ruler invulnerable, almost sacred. Defeat places a Russian ruler in danger from his closest courtiers, ministers and generals. While one thinks of tsars overthrown by crowds, most are actually destroyed by their closest colleagues deep within their own palaces. The modern prototype would be another secret-policeman-aspiring- to-rule, Lavrenti Beria, overthrown in June 1953 by his trusted, somewhat inferior comrades, Khrushchev and Malenkov (whose house at Novo-Ogorovo is now Putin’s home—what a small world) at a surprise meeting. He was shot.  When Russian leaders fall, nemesis usually comes from those closest. “When you walk down the corridors,” mused Stalin, “you never go when it’s going to come.” Putin is not paranoid; he has ever reason to be vigilant.  Domitian would sympathize.

"assassination","2023-05-09","Not Discerned","{""Islamabad"", ""FederalCapitalArea"", ""Pakistan""}","Thu 18 May 2023 05:16:25","© Provided by Firstpost Pakistan is teetering on the edge of a cyclical phenomenon, but this time stakes are too high  High-voltage spectacle leading to the arrest of former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan by the Rangers on 9 May 2023 at the Court House in Islamabad resulted in turmoil across the country. The intensity of violence unleashed by the workers of Imran’s party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), was well beyond expectations. The rampage resulted in the loss of over a dozen lives and colossal damage to the property, including that of military establishments. Despite the ruthless crackdown by security forces, the environment continues to be volatile.  The explosive situation took another dramatic turn two days later when on 11 May, the Supreme Court of Pakistan (SC) ordered Imran Khan’s immediate release, calling his arrest to be illegal. While Imran’s followers rejoiced, the government accused the judiciary of acting politically and favouring the former prime minister. The SC decision came as a jolt even for the army. The next very day, Islamabad High Court granted bail to Imran Khan along with two weeks’ reprieve from arrest in the Al-Qadir trust case. It also provided him immunity from arrest in any case filed after 9 May. Immediately on his release, Imran Khan went ballistic, squarely blaming the Army Chief General Asim Munir for destroying the nation and creating chaos.  The gravity of the prevailing situation reverberates the outrage that followed former prime minister Benazir Bhutto’s assassination in 2007. Ongoing unrest probably is the worst since 1971, which ended up in the dismemberment of Pakistan. The current political calamity could not have come at the worst time when Pakistan is in the grip of a serious economic crisis, almost on the verge of bankruptcy.  In its 75 years of existence, for half the time Pakistan has been ruled by army generals. Even during the times, the civilian government was in place, the army continued to exercise effective control by proxy. For that matter, Imran Khan also wears the tag of the selected prime minister as the army played a key role in his coming to power in 2018, orchestrating the dismissal of the Nawaz Sharif government on corruption charges.  Going by the history of civil-military relations in Pakistan, no civilian government has been able to complete its full term. So was the case with Imran Khan who fell out of favour with the then Army Chief General Qamar Bajwa, his benefactor, over the appointment of DG ISI (Director General Inter Service Intelligence). While Imran Khan wanted Lt Gen Faiz Hameed to continue as the head of ISI and subsequently take over as the Chief, General Bajwa overruled the prime minister and appointed Lt Gen Nadeem Anjum as the DG.  The army ultimately got rid of Imran Khan last April, by engineering his toppling through a ‘no confidence motion’ paving the way for Shehbaz Sharif to become the prime minister. After his ouster, Imran Khan vociferously took up an anti-army stance, gaining considerable public popularity in the process. He went on to level allegations against Major General Faisal Nasser, head of counter-intelligence in ISI for an attempt on his life. Imran Khan has been demanding early elections in a bid to cash in the favourable public sentiments. However, his coming to power is not in the army’s interest. General Asim Munir, in fact, has a personal grudge against Imran Khan for removing him from the post of DG ISI prematurely when he reportedly initiated an investigation of corruption charges against Bushra Bibi-Imran’s wife.  Unprecedented public anger is directed against the Pakistan Army (Chief) fueled by hardships faced by the common person in the wake of harsh economic conditions, given that military continues to maintain a lavish lifestyle. There are also reports about dissidence within the army, evident from a major military reshuffle wherein Lt Gen Salman Ghani commander of the Lahore-based Corps stands replaced by Lt Gen Fayyaz Shah. Reports of purges against the pro-Imran elements in the army have also surfaced.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tc24uY29tL2VuLWluL25ld3Mvb3RoZXIvcGFraXN0YW4taXMtdGVldGVyaW5nLW9uLXRoZS1lZGdlLW9mLWEtY3ljbGljYWwtcGhlbm9tZW5vbi1idXQtdGhpcy10aW1lLXN0YWtlcy1hcmUtdG9vLWhpZ2gvYXItQUExYmw5VFk_bGk9QUFnZ2VzMdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

If reports are to be believed, Vladimir Putin has reportedly signed a decree which will make obtaining Russian citizenship for foreign nationals easy and quick.  The decree, which is signed by the Russian President is likely to simplify the process of obtaining Russian citizenship for those foreign nationals, who will serve in Russia's army against Ukraine. As per a report in the Hindustan Times, the decree will apply only to foreign nations who will sign contracts with the Russian army to serve in the military for a period of one year.

As per the report, only those individuals and their family members who serve in the army will be eligible to apply for Russian citizenship. These individuals will not be required to obtain a residence permit. Reportedly, the move by Russian President Vladimir Putin comes after the counteroffensive by Ukraine against Russia's invasion.  Several reports also claim that Vladimir Putin has signed a number of decrees in a bid to boost the number of his troops as Russia faces loss amid the ongoing war. The move to grant Russian citizenship to foreign nationals comes a year after the Russian government last year approved legislation to remove the upper age limit for contractual service in the Russian army.

Aspiring law student Aya, 19, was murdered during the month of Ramadan on Sunday, May 17, 2020, as she walked by Quick Shine Car Wash on Whalley Banks.  She was struck by a stray bullet, shot from a passing Toyota Avensis.  Aya’s mum, Samar Salame visited Blackburn and was joined by some of Aya’s friends.  New pictures were also released of the student by the family.  The family have said it is very difficult to return to the town following the events of 2020, having since moved to London.  Mrs Salame spent time putting flowers around a pole which has become a focal point for commemorations each year.  She had to be supported by friends who had come to pay their own respects to Aya.  On occasions passers-by would stop to say dua (prayers) and others came to lay their own flowers at the spot.  Aya’s mum, Samar Salame visited Blackburn on the anniversary of the death  Speaking today Mrs Salame said found it hard to return to the town since the death of her daughter.  Holding back tears she had to be comforted by Aya’s friends as she spoke.  She said: “It is not fair. For those people to be breathing and alive and my daughter she under the soil in her grave.  “Still her brothers and sisters are suffering. Our life is damaged. They smashed us. They killed us.  “I hope their prisons will be their graves.”  New pictures of Aya have been released on the third anniversary of her death (NQ/Aya Hachem Family)  Permanent memorial to remember Aya  It has also been revealed there are plans to make a permanent memorial at the site where Aya was killed.  This will be in the form of a plaque on the pole, which would be painted the colour green.  The family are said to be looking at producing their own plaque which would be a permanent reminder of that fateful day and also celebrate the life of Aya.  The pole is owned by broadband company 6G Internet and the firm said they would work with the family in ‘whatever way they could’.  Simon Jones from 6G Internet said: “This is an extremely sombre time for the family, the local community and the whole town.  “If the family wish to commemorate the life of Aya Hachem at the site with a permanent memorial we will do whatever we can to assist them.”  The company also said it would pay for any costs incurred for the memorial.  Who was Aya Hachem?  Aya was an aspiring lawyer who was studying at the University of Salford, and her family had moved to Blackburn 10 years before her death, fleeing from violence in Lebanon.  Five years after arriving in the country, a 14-year-old Aya Hachem and her parents went to a charity event to help traumatised refugees settle into life in the county.  In the decade she lived in the town, Aya thrust herself into British life, learning English and excelling at school. She became one of the Children’s Society’s youngest ever trustees at 16.  Aya started at the University of Salford when she was 18 and was in her second year when she was murdered.  What happened on the day  Aya Hachem was walking home from Lidl, passing Quick Shine Tyres in Blackburn on May 17, 2020, when a hit which had been organised to kill the business owner, Pachah Khan, tragically saw her shot and killed.  The assassination attempt was organised by one of the owners of RI Tyres, Quick Shine’s neighbouring business, because they were angry about the fact Quick Shine had started to sell tyres.

Lincoln’s religion has been treated before, in the hagiographies that followed his assassination, when “Americans needed to memorialize Lincoln as a Christian martyr,” as Zeitz puts it, and in the writings of his former law partner, William Herndon, who set out to define him as an “un-believer.” Zeitz weaves between the dogmas, revealing a complex thinker who deftly merged religious language with political goals and underwent a “spiritual renewal” during the Civil War, especially after the death of his son Willie in 1862.  Zeitz adds meaningful context to the story, examining the ways in which soldiers experienced religion in the field; both sides held revival meetings. Above and below the Mason-Dixon line, religious leaders leaned into the conflict and found reasons to believe they enjoyed a special relationship with the Almighty. The Confederacy claimed God’s support in its Constitution and motto (“Deo vindice”). Southern leaders denounced Northerners as “infidels,” a word that was sometimes applied to Lincoln, and claimed that the Bible justified slavery.  Lincoln, of course, disagreed with that selective reading, and as he moved decisively against slavery in the final years of the war, he often claimed a spiritual justification. His speeches drew heavily on Scripture, including, in 1858, the “house divided” (Matthew 12:25); then, at Gettysburg, “four score and seven years ago” (paraphrasing Psalm 90); the second Inaugural Address, with its readings from Matthew 18:7 (“woe unto the world because of offenses …”); and Psalm 19 (“the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether”). Frederick Douglass, who was present at the second inauguration, called it “more like a sermon than a state paper.” One scholar estimated that “266 of its 702 words were quoted verbatim from the word of God.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTcvYm9va3MvcmV2aWV3L2xpbmNvbG5zLWdvZC1qb3NodWEtemVpdHouaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2023-07-01","Not Discerned","{""SanFrancisco"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 11:00:00","Two decades ago, Jacob Langfelder was a Midwestern kid who’d moved to New York with big theater dreams and a job waiting tables.  Today, his production company Broadway and Vine is bringing a bevy of stage and screen celebs to Wine Country — and all before the company’s second birthday.  Its summer outdoor concert series, announced in April, includes San Francisco native Darren Criss (FX’s “The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story,” Fox’s “Glee” and “Hedwig and the Angry Inch” on Broadway) on July 28; Sutton Foster (TV Land’s “Younger,” “The Music Man” on Broadway with Hugh Jackman) on Aug. 2; and actor and model Brooke Shields on Aug. 29. It all kicks off with Tituss Burgess (Netflix’s “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt” and “Schmigadoon!” on Apple TV+) on June 27. Attendees enjoy not just a concert in a vineyard under the evening sky, but also a wine tasting and a vintner dinner.  The story of how Langfelder made his career leap draws equally on his time treading the boards and his gigs reciting menu specials.  “As most people do, I got into waiting tables as a survival job,” the Springfield, Ill., native told The Chronicle. But unlike many aspiring actors, “I fell in love with hospitality.”  In between touring with Jonathan Groff in “The Sound of Music” or performing in Stephen Sondheim musicals, he worked at Craft as Tom Colicchio (“Top Chef”) was becoming a celebrity chef and at other haute cuisine spots including Jean-Georges and Daniel.  “Maybe it was a bit of the performer in me,” Langfelder recalled. To him, serving meals at a hip restaurant was like acting in a hit show.  On vacations, he discovered another love — Napa Valley — finally seeing in person the wine regions he discussed with restaurant patrons.  Around 2013, his passions for hospitality and theater merged for the first time when he started managing 54 Below, which included booking artists.  “When I started putting artists onstage, I got that same — not butterflies, but that excitement of when I was onstage,” Langfelder said. “I fought so hard to be on the stage, and to finally have something that I could lend to other artists was really fulfilling.”  Then in 2016, he happened to be talking with friends in Bouchon Bakery Time Warner about where to take a show when Thomas Keller walked by and sat down. “I said, ‘I would really love to bring Broadway to Napa,’ ” Langfelder recounted. Keller was receptive to the idea and made some introductions with Wine Country movers and shakers.  Keller was “happy to have played a small part in something that is enriching the Napa Valley arts community,” he said in a statement to The Chronicle.  Langfelder officially moved to the region in 2018, getting to know the scene by producing events for Festival Napa Valley, the annual event blending arts performances, wine and food. It takes place this year July 8-23.  Langfelder’s Broadway and Vine, blending Wine Country’s comestibles, libations and vineyard views with a chance to see Broadway stars without all the razzle-dazzle, debuted with Tony Award nominee Tony Yazbeck in 2021, as much of the rest of the world was reopening from the pandemic, thanks to vaccines.  But Napa had its additional wounds. When Langfelder introduced Yazbeck at Tre Posti in St. Helena, he could see the scars of 2020’s Glass Fire across the valley. “We were all just starved to do something,” Langfelder said. He thought, “Can I just do, like, one show? And if it doesn’t work we’ll just throw in the towel?”  But it did work. Since then, Broadway and Vine has hosted Lea Michele (“Glee” and “Funny Girl” on Broadway), Fairfield native Taylor Iman Jones (“Head Over Heels”) and Abby Mueller (“Beautiful: The Carole King Musical”). The company adds to the Broadway offerings of Transcendence Theatre Company, which also produces in the region but specializes in large-cast revues.  Langfelder knows tourists might not associate Wine Country with Broadway, so he especially looks for crossover talent. He also acknowledged that some of his guests are coming for the concerts and that others attend for the food and wine bigwigs.  “You get the performer saying, ‘I have no idea who these wine people are, but I love all of it,’ ” Langfelder said, “and the same with the vice versa.”  To witness top-tier musical talent in the middle of nature’s splendor? “You essentially get to be Julie Andrews on the mountaintop,” Langfelder said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tc24uY29tL2VuLXVzL3RyYXZlbC90cmlwaWRlYXMvd2hlcmUtdG8tc2VlLWJyb2Fkd2F5LXN0YXJzLWxpa2UtZGFycmVuLWNyaXNzLWFuZC1zdXR0b24tZm9zdGVyLXdpbmUtY291bnRyeS9hci1BQTFiajdIej9vY2lkPWhwbG9jYWxuZXdz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2023-05-17","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 16:13:00","One Piece chapter 1084 raw scans were released on Wednesday, May 17, 2023, bringing with them a truly exciting on-hands look at the issue’s alleged events. While spoilers and raw scans, however legitimate they may seem, aren’t officially confirmed until the chapter officially releases via Shueisha, the raw scans do corroborate information from text-based leaks.  Likewise, One Piece chapter 1084 does allegedly and excitingly show Im-sama confronting Nefertari Cobra during his discussion with the Gorosei. Especially shocking about this move is that he establishes himself as the true ruler of the World Government by sitting on the Empty Throne. It’s likely at this moment that Cobra became a target of assassination for the World Government.  Assuming the raw scans are proven legitimate upon the issue’s official release, One Piece chapter 1084 seems set to be an incredibly exciting follow-up to the Reverie flashback. While the announcement of a one-week break for the next issue is unfortunate, fans will undoubtedly see it prove worth the wait upon its official release.  One Piece chapter 1084's raw scans show Charlos’ attempts at capturing Shirahoshi while Cobra meets Im-sama  Raw scans  ONE PIECE (ワンピース) Spoilers @OP_SPOILERS2023 #ONEPIECE1084    Luffy in the Cover Page of Weekly Shonen Jump Magazine Issue No. 25 Luffy in the Cover Page of Weekly Shonen Jump Magazine Issue No. 25 #ONEPIECE1084Luffy in the Cover Page of Weekly Shonen Jump Magazine Issue No. 25🔥 https://t.co/ZTnfZM9N7c  One Piece chapter 1084’s raw scans begin with a focus on Sabo, who is still making his way through Pangaea Castle while fighting the fortress’ guards. Jewelry Bonney appears out of nowhere after he eliminates one group of enemies, and the two then begin making their way through the castle together.  One of Karasu’s crows appears next to them as they run and says something to Sabo that seemingly shocks him. The crow is then shown to have a ring of keys in its mouth, possibly suggesting that Kuma has been or will be freed imminently. Sabo then hears some enemies coming, prompting him to pick up Bonney and hide on one of the hall’s decorative arches.  Later on, the two are shown to be discussing something after having come down from the rafters. However, the focus doesn’t stay on them long, as One Piece chapter 1084 then focuses on the Empty Throne room, where Cobra Nefertari is meeting with the Gorosei. He seems to be discussing some aspect of the Void Century and the World Government’s formation with them, given the use of the numbers “800” and “20” in his dialogue.  Cobra seems to be discussing a former Queen of Alabasta, seemingly corroborating the information found in text-based spoilers earlier in the week. The Gorosei show no visible reactions to this topic, but Cobra seems to be getting sterner and sterner as the conversation continues.  It’s then revealed that Im-sama has been listening to this conversation the entire time from the Room of Flowers. Meanwhile, Cobra is bringing up the initial “D,” which gets a rise out of a majority of the Gorosei. One Piece chapter 1084 then shifts to elsewhere at the Reverie, where Saint Charlos is yet again trying to capture Shirahoshi.  Other Celestial Dragons are seemingly telling the overjoyed Charlos not to do this, but he doesn’t seem to listen. Shirahoshi’s brother, Fukaboshi, then angrily rushes onto the scene, clearly intent on reclaiming his sister. He rushes Charlos, prompting Kuma to fire a laser beam in his direction. Thankfully, both he and Shirahoshi are able to get out of the way in time.  Fukaboshi then continues to rush Charlos while Rebecca, Leo of the Tontatta Tribe, and Sai of the Happo Navy observe. Saint Donquixote Mjosgard, who has personal ties with the Neptune royal family, gets in between Fukaboshi and Charlos to stop the former from doing something he’ll regret.  Leo and Sai, meanwhile, both attack Charlos, prompting Morley to take advantage of the opportunity to rescue Kuma. However, he makes himself known to the others as he does this, causing a stir despite the fact that Shirahoshi is now safe. One Piece chapter 1084 then returns to the Empty Throne room, where Im-sama is now ascending the stairs to the Empty Throne.  The Gorosei silently watch as this happens, as does Cobra with a horrified expression on his face. The issue then ends with Im-sama sitting on the Empty Throne and seemingly speaking to Cobra directly. Unfortunately, the chapter does end with the announcement of a series’ break next week.

The chances are rising due to emissions from human activities plus the El Niño weather event expected this summer. If the world passes the limit, scientists stress the breach, while worrying, will likely be temporary.

"assassination","2018-03-18","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 11:00:00","Diagrams showing a tunnel complex beneath Putin's Black Sea palace are evidence of just how long the Russian leader has been fixated on the possibility of existential conflict with the West. Contributor/Getty Images; FBK; Metro 2000 via Wayback Machine; Alyssa Powell/Insider  You would think that the architects who designed Vladimir Putin's palace thought of everything.  After all, the 190,000-square-foot, billion-dollar complex, perched on a rugged bluff overlooking the Black Sea, has every luxury that an autocrat could possibly desire. As revealed by Alexei Navalny's investigation, the palace has its own church, wine cellar, and casino. It has a hookah lounge complete with a stripper pole, an arboretum, and an ice rink for the hockey games Putin likes to play with cronies. But good luck ordering takeout — security is tight. Putin's imperial dacha is sealed off from the country he rules by 17,000 acres of woodland and a special no-fly zone.  The precautions are more than paranoia on Putin's part. Earlier this month, Russian authorities claimed that two drones had attempted to assassinate Putin in a failed strike that ended in an explosion above the Kremlin.  But, despite all these princely luxuries and castle-like defenses, the palace's builders appear to have neglected one crucial detail. They failed to hide plans showing two elaborate tunnels running beneath the palace complex — plans that any competent state-security apparatus would fight tooth-and-nail to keep secret.  In fact, they were posted publicly to the Russian internet. Metro Style, a now-defunct Russian contractor, posted the diagrams to their website to showcase their work in the early 2010's. They were viewable online as late as 2016.  Today, Insider is publishing annotated versions of the diagrams with English-language translations, which can be viewed below.  The underground complex beneath Putin's palace consists of two separate tunnels connected by an elevator that descends roughly 50 meters below the surface. The architectural plans show the tunnels encased in thick concrete are supplied with enough fresh water, ventilation and extensive cables to support VIP occupants for days or weeks at a time. An expert who reviewed the tunnel plans saw signs of Putin's obsession with survival at a time other strongmen were falling.  Story continues  ""Putin has a lot of anxiety about being the not-entirely-legitimate leader of Russia,"" said Michael C. Kimmage, a former State Department official who worked on Russia and Ukraine policy. ""So knowing that his legitimacy is not entirely secured by elections, he is going to seek to maximize his personal safety through a complex of well-defended personal residences.""  The exits from those tunnels are visible just below the palace complex, on the bare cliff rising up from the beach:  Two entrances to the underground tunnel complex are visible on the hillside beneath Putin's palace. aerial photo by FBK; Insider  The lower tunnel includes a moving walkway leading to the exit. ""This tunnel set-up has all kinds of safety and security,"" said Thaddeus Gabryszewski, a structural engineer familiar with defensive structures who reviewed the diagrams for Insider. ""There's a fire system. There's water, there's sewer. This is intended for someone to survive or escape.""  All leaders of nuclear states make plans for extreme contingencies. The US president has an emergency bunker beneath the White House, and Mount Weather in Virginia. But unlike US facilities, the Black Sea complex was privately funded and remains privately owned. It appears intended not to insure the continuity of a political system so much as the survival of one individual. Putin's investment in a tunnel complex beneath a brand-new vacation home, built during years when he was still publicly flirting with Russian integration into Europe, is evidence of just how long the Russian leader has been preparing for threats, and building the trapdoors he would need to shelter or escape. ""We have to see this as part of a long confrontation with the West that has marked the last 13 or 14 years of Putin's life,"" said Kimmage.  A cross-section of the hillside shows two tunnels connected by an elevator, at right. Metro Style via Wayback Machine; annotations by Insider  ""These images are not blueprints,"" Gabryszewski told Insider. ""They are closer to architectural drawings. They show you the intent, the flow, and the premise of these spaces.""  The two tunnels are approximately 40 and 60 meters long, respectively, and 6 meters wide, creating about 6,500 square feet of potential living space that bears signs of being blast-proof. Their ability to withstand the impact of a nuclear blast or a bunker-buster bomb would depend on two factors that aren't in the diagrams — how the tunnels' 15-inch thick concrete shells are reinforced and the material used to fill the area around them, Gabryszewski said.  They show several features that suggest Putin commissioned the structure with worst-case scenarios in mind. Especially striking are 16 cable racks, each about a foot wide, embedded into the wall of the lower tunnel. These racks are designed for the ""conduit"" cables that can carry electricity, lighting, copper wire and fiber optic cable needed for a command post.  A cross-section showing the interior of the lower tunnel, which includes a moving walkway leading to the beach. Metro Style via Wayback Machine; annotation and translations by Insider  The sheer volume of conduit running through the lower tunnel is important because it's far more than would likely be necessary to operate the tunnel's own internal systems. ""Those trays could be for communications, lighting, power — anything that goes through a cable or tube,"" Gabryszewski said. ""It's an awful lot of cable just for the tunnel itself. So it could be some kind of back-up system for the palace complex."" Rather than serving merely as an escape passage, one of the tunnels' purposes appears to be a kind of emergency spinal cord for the entire palace complex.  Neither the Moscow-based company that acquired Metro Style, nor Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin's chief spokesperson, responded to requests for comment. Amid mass protests triggered by Navalny's 2021 video investigation, Putin denied owning the Black Sea palace.  Metro Style, a company founded in the 90's by three men who have gone on to found several construction companies since, was also hired by the Russian government to dig subway tunnels beneath Moscow. When the company posted the diagrams to their website, they did not specify that the Black Sea tunnels were built for Putin. Instead, they described ""a complex of underground structures for a boarding house in the city of Gelendzhik, Krasnodar Territory."" Gelendzhik is the town closest to the palace complex, a five-hour drive from the resort city of Sochi.  The existence of the fortified tunnels, nearly 1,000 miles away from Moscow, demonstrates that Putin isn't just focussed on indulging his taste for the high life near a resort town. He is also concerned with staying alive. Survivalism was a likely driver behind the tunnels' remote location, said Kimmage, the former State Department official who is now a professor at Catholic University. ""The two times there has been a big transition in Russian history — 1917 and 1991 — the status of the capital city and the leader's position there has been a big issue,"" Kimmage said. ""Putin is solving for that contingency by establishing a network of residences that are as far from the center as possible. So a tunnel system within the Black Sea complex makes a lot of sense. Even without an active threat, he's going to be worrying about this eventuality.""  A cutaway diagram showing the interior of the elevator shaft connecting the two tunnels indicates six separate ventilation shafts designed to deliver fresh or filtered air to the tunnel's occupants.  A cross section of the vertical elevator shaft. Metro Style via Wayback Machine; annotation and translations by Insider  The multiple ventilation shafts and the two separate tunnels could have been designed with a chemical attack in mind, layering in redundancies that make it harder to wholly constrict the palace's supply of clean air; the multiple cable conduits could serve similar purposes. Two separate portals on the hillside ""creates a secondary and tertiary backup for ventilation,"" said Gabryszewski. ""If there's some kind of attack, Putin has got two sources of air intake, one high and one low.""  The diagrams do not offer any detailed views of structures to the east of the tunnel complex. Given that it appears to connect the tunnels with a road, it's possible that the eastern structures are designed to be a route through which supplies can be loaded through the hidden elevator and into the palace complex. Gabryszewski highlighted an area near the end of the road, beside the tunnel complex, that could be used for loading and unloading shipments of supplies.  An aerial view of the palace complex and the three tunnel entrances. Google Earth; annotations by Insider  This 3D model shows the two tunnels as well as a third entrance, to the right. 3D model by Sect Ze; annotations by Insider  A link to the diagrams, saved for posterity on the Wayback Machine internet archive, circulated for years among a Moscow subculture known as ""diggers,"" urban explorers who visit and document forbidden sites, before appearing in a comprehensive report on the palace assembled by Navalny, the Russian opposition politician who is now serving a 9-year sentence in a Russian penal colony. The diagrams were first brought to Insider's attention by an anonymous digger who said he was affiliated with a group called ""Sect Ze."" A spokesperson for the group said in an email exchange that they were sharing their findings ""because we are tired of Putin's stupid face and want to show his paranoid underground transport."" In a follow-up video call, he said he is speaking up to ""bring closer the end of the regime.""  Kimmage, the former State Department official, said that Putin's careful preparations more than a decade ago indicate how long his mind has been focussed on the possibility of existential conflict with the West.  ""With the war in Ukraine,"" Kimmage said, ""there's speechmaking, there's propaganda, there's exaggeration — there's this performative aspect that plays to Russia's domestic politics. But this is also deadly real. Putin perceives himself as being engaged in a confrontation with the West. The nuclear dimension is an important part of that. He knows he is standing on top of a volcano. He doesn't seem to be so psychopathic as to initiate a nuclear conflict — he has grandchildren — but he's been standing on that edge for a very long time. These tunnels, this bunker, is a part of that.""  Mattathias Schwartz is Insider's chief national security correspondent. He can be reached by email at schwartz79@protonmail.com.

"assassination","1351-11-06","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 08:49:48","If you want a bit of peace an tranquillity amongst the bustle of Torquay, Torre Abbey is that place. A House of God, a Georgian house, a Victorian estate and now a museum, art gallery and gardens.  It wasn’t always like that.    The medieval Abbey was a very rich and powerful place and so it attracted the attention of those with less spiritual motives. Here was an institution with extensive resources and potential patronage opportunities. It could dispense benefices, employ people and grant leases on lands and tithes.    Torre Abbey was big business, so who was in charge mattered. And disputes over control could lead to kidnap and murder.  In 1345 Abbot Simon de Plympton died and the canons had to appoint a new head. Richard de Cotelford was elected but the father-abbot refused to confirm the election. Instead he appointed John Gras. Although Richard’s family were landholders in South Brent, John Gras was better connected. This was a common reason for the overturning of elections by outside interests.  John Gras ruled for three and a half years, dying in early 1349, possibly a victim of the Black Death that ravaged the South West. His successor, John de Berkadone, was confirmed in May 1349.    However, Richard de Cotelford had always complained that he had been cheated out of his rightful position. He continued to press his claim and in November 1349 won his case, receiving confirmation from the exiled bishop of Porto.  Two years later in August 1351, Richard returned to England from Avignon, going first to Westminster to receive royal support. He then journeyed to Torre, expecting when he arrived to be welcomed by the appreciative abbots and local landowners. To support his legitimate claim, he was accompanied by Roger de Queryngdon, the bearer of the King’s protection. That was the idea, anyway.    However, the return of Richard hadn’t gone down well with those who had installed John de Berkadone a couple of years earlier and who had presumably done quite well out of the appointment.    On 6 November 1351 it was recorded that “a large confederacy of disturbers of the peace, men at arms, and others purpose to come to the abbey and the granges, manors, and other places annexed to the abbey and consume and waste the goods and things therein.‟  Two weeks later, on 20 November, a commission was appointed to investigate this group of men who “broke by night his close, church and treasury at Torre Moun, co. Devon, carried away his goods and assaulted his men and servants, whereby he lost their service for a great time.”  It named a number of those involved in this attack who, it was disclosed, came from Totnes, West Devon, Dartington, Ashburton, and Dartmouth, alongside “many others‟.    Around this time Richard and Roger de Queryngdon were kidnapped and murdered.  It looks like the objective was to remove Richard from his leadership of the Abbey.  The attackers came from the lower gentry and townsmen of South Devon and it seems most likely that the assassins were sent on their violent mission by Geoffrey Gras. Geoffrey was the kinsman of the deceased abbot John Gras whose election Richard had overturned. John de Berkadone was then reinstated as abbot.  Effectively, Geoffrey Gras had kidnapped and killed Richard de Cotelford, along with the King’s messenger, to ensure his continued influence at Torre Abbey.  An attack on any Christian abbey was, of course, a serious breach of the peace. The assassination of a senior member of the clergy, disrespect to the King’s protection, and the kidnapping and murder of his messenger were also great offences.  However, even though the gang were named in the commission, they appear not to have suffered any punishment and Geoffrey Gras was pardoned.  Gras and his family remained closely connected to the Abbey even after he had kidnapped and slain their elected leader. The white-cassocked canons seem to be willing to let the attack be forgotten. Or perhaps they just didn’t have any choice in the matter.  ‘Torquay: A Social History’ by local author Kevin Dixon is available for £10 from Artizan Gallery, Lucius Street, Torquay, or:    https://www.art-hub.co.uk/product-page/torquay-a-social-history-by-kevin-dixon","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd2VhcmVzb3V0aGRldm9uLmNvbS90b3JyZS1hYmJleS1zdWNjZXNzaW9uLWtpZG5hcC1hbmQtbXVyZGVyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Following the release of the Pentagon Papers, the pair assumed the task of plugging leaks to the press that could further damage the president’s reputation — a job that earned them the nickname “the plumbers.” Their efforts to keep Nixon in power culminated in June 1972, when they endeavored to burglarize and wiretap the Democratic National Committee’s headquarters at the Watergate Complex in Washington.  In the show, Woody Harrelson plays the gruff and enigmatic Hunt alongside Justin Theroux as a comically mustached Liddy. Viewers of the show might suspect that its creators took liberties to portray the two men as more eccentric than they actually were. But the truth is, the real White House Plumbers were crazier, bolder, and more outlandish than any character dreamt up in a writers’ room.

He spent two years patrolling the sea around England before transferring to the US Army Air Corps.

"assassination","2023-10-06","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 20:00:00","Warning: Spoilers ahead for Avengers #1 (2023)!  Avengers assemble! Captain Marvel has just put together a new incarnation of Earth’s Mightiest Heroes. The latest Avengers roster includes Captain Marvel, Captain America (Sam Wilson), Iron Man, Vision, Scarlet Witch, Black Panther, and Thor. But is there room in their lineup for another powerhouse?  Avengers #1 (written by Jed MacKay and penciled by C.F. Villa) ends with the surprise arrival of Kang. But the time traveling conqueror doesn’t want to attack the Avengers, he wants to warn them. What’s going on?  Kang, ally or enemy?  The Avengers are taking a moment to reset. After the events of Jason Aaron’s Avengers Assemble storyline, the group has decided to temporarily disband. This has allowed the team to reassess their place in the world so they could forge a new beginning. Carol Danvers is named team chairperson, and most of Avengers #1 involves her putting together the new roster.  As Captain Marvel explains, this new iteration of the Avengers will get back to the core of what made the team inspiring in the first place. “The Avengers aren’t cops. Or, at least, we shouldn’t be. That doesn’t work, that just gets us into civil wars,” Carol tells Iron Man. “The Avengers are firefighters. We’re the ones who fly into the blaze, whatever it is.”  The new Avengers then battle Terminus, a behemoth who enjoys destroying planets. During the battle, Scarlet Witch casts a powerful spell, which causes a huge surge of energy. Captain Marvel then finds herself displaced in Null-Time, the space between time. It’s unknown if this was a result of Wanda’s spell or other forces.  As Captain Marvel gathers her bearings, she’s surprised to find herself face to face with Kang. However, the Avengers’ enemy has seen better days. The deadly villain is severely wounded and missing most of his armor. “You’ve come to my deathbed Carol Danvers. We must speak. I have a warning for you,” Kang weakly says.  Why is Kang wounded?  Kang the Conqueror has a reputation for being one of Marvel’s most fearsome villains, so the sight of him humbled and broken might be a bit surprising. However, you wouldn’t be surprised if you read Timeless #1 (2023). The one-shot followed Kang as he searched the timeline for something called the Missing Moment. As you have probably gathered, the search didn’t go so well. The thing about searching for mythical items is that you usually find yourself clashing with others.  A group known as the Twilight Court sought the Missing Moment for their master, a villain named Myrddin. It wasn’t long before their paths crossed, and Kang was in for a world of hurt. Myrddin stabbed Kang through the chest, critically wounding the time tyrant. In a last-ditch effort for survival, Kang transported himself to Null-Time. “If I’m to thwart Myrddin, even from beyond the grave, then I will require heroes of my own,” Kang says.  So, Kang is looking for heroes, and now he’s face to face with Captain Marvel. She said that her new Avengers would rush into the blaze to save people, but does that include madmen like Kang?  Will Kang join the Avengers? What’s next for the villainous conqueror?  Will this lead to Kang joining the Avengers, or destroying them? Popverse doesn’t have a time machine, but we can look at comic solicitations for a hint on what the future might hold. Avengers #2 goes on sale June 21, and the solicitation states, “The Avengers find themselves with a rare gift – foreknowledge of the dangers coming their way in the form of the deadly TRIBULATION EVENTS. But can this information be trusted? And can even Earth’s Mightiest Heroes triumph in the face of cascading disaster?”  Avengers #3 goes on sale July 26, and the solicitation states, “The first Tribulation Event strikes the Earth! The Avengers fly into the action as the Ashen Combine – a collection of the Multiverse’s greatest monsters – descend from the Impossible City to follow their respective appetites. Cityslayers all, pursuing the assassination of metropolitan areas for sport!”  Neither solicitation says anything about Kang, but they don’t have to. The copy makes it clear that the Avengers will be going on Kang’s quest to stop Myrddin, which includes making their way through the Tribulation Events. As established in Timeless #1, Tribulation Events are fixed moments in history. You cannot find the Missing Moment without going through the Tribulation Events, and only heroes can access them. This is why Myrddin formed the Twilight Court, as he wasn’t a hero.  There is a lot we still don’t know about the nature of the Missing Moment, but it appears that it will be deadly in the wrong hands. Whether the Avengers trust Kang or not, it’s in their best interest to stop Myrddin from obtaining the Missing Moment. And then what? Will Kang betray the Avengers once his rival is out of the way? Is he just using them to get the Missing Moment for himself? Probably.  However, Kang might surprise us. Plenty of reformed villains have become central parts of the Avengers’ roster, including Hawkeye, Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch, and Black Widow. Maybe Jed MacKay has a surprise up his sleeve, with plans for a Kang redemption arc.  However, the difference is those reformed villains wanted to change. For now, it seems Kang just wants the Missing Moment for himself, and he isn’t after Myrddin for any moral reasons. Plus, Kang is currently gearing up to be the MCU’s next big bad. Making Kang a hero in the comics while he’s a villain onscreen might hurt some of that corporate synergy Marvel loves so much.  It looks like Kang’s journey is at an interesting crossroads, and only time will tell which way it goes.  Avengers #1 (written by Jed MacKay and penciled by C.F. Villa) is available now.

"assassination","2018-11-04","Not Discerned","{""Kremlin"", ""Oklahoma"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 20:01:14","By Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber  GENEVA (Reuters) – Evgenia Kara-Murza, wife of jailed Russian opposition figure Vladimir Kara-Murza, said authorities were torturing him psychologically by denying him calls with his children while he serves a 25-year sentence on charges he says are politically motivated.  Speaking to Reuters on the sidelines of the Geneva Summit for Human Rights and Democracy, Evgenia Kara-Murza said her husband’s repeated requests to speak to his three children – aged 11, 14 and 17 – were denied given that they now live in the United States.  “Vladimir very much misses his kids, his family, and he’s devastated that he has not been able to talk to us in over a year,” Evgenia Kara-Murza said on Wednesday. “And the authorities know that. They’re just using it as a psychological torture against him.”  Russia’s Federal Penitentiary Service did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Convicted last month of treason and other offences for publicly condemning Russia’s leadership and the war in Ukraine, Vladimir Kara-Murza received the harshest sentence of its kind since the February 2022 invasion.  He was detained in April last year, hours after CNN broadcast an interview in which he said Russia was being run by a “regime of murderers”.  State prosecutors accused the 41-year-old of treason, among other offences, and of discrediting the Russian military by spreading “knowingly false information” about its conduct in what Moscow calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine.  Vladimir Kara-Murza, who holds Russian and British passports, was a close associate of Boris Nemtsov, an opposition figure assassinated near the Kremlin in 2015. He continued to speak out against President Vladimir Putin.  “Had I tried to convince him to give up his fight, I would have betrayed him,” Evgenia Kara-Murza said.  ‘PERSONAL ENEMY’  Evgenia Kara-Murza said her husband’s successful lobbying of foreign governments and institutions to impose sanctions on Russia and individual Russians for human rights violations had made him a “personal enemy” of the Kremlin.  “Dictatorships all over the world are very much afraid of clear, strong voices that refuse to be intimidated. And Vladimir’s voice is one such voice.”  Despite not being able to speak to him, his children have grown up being acutely aware of the perils of being an opposition figure in Russia.  They witnessed their father slip into comas after poisonings in 2015 and 2017 that left him with a serious nerve disorder called polyneuropathy. Russian authorities denied any involvement.  “Their father was first poisoned when our oldest was nine,” Evgenia Kara-Murza said. “She’s now 17. That’s half of her life she spent knowing that her father was being targeted again and again and again.”  (Reporting by Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber; Editing by Alex Richardson)","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3R2YmFtLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE3L2phaWxlZC1ydXNzaWFuLW9wcG9zaXRpb24tZmlndXJlLWthcmEtbXVyemEtZmFjZXMtcHN5Y2hvbG9naWNhbC10b3J0dXJlLXdpZmUtc2F5cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

This lone photo bears the testimony of the nation’s pride and pain.  In the photograph, it is shown that how Sheikh Hasina, the luckless daughter of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, found their Dhanmondi-32 house in Dhaka locked upon her return to country on May 17, 1981 ending her six-year in exile. Her entry into their house was subject to permission from the military authority.  house was under the army authority until June 10, 1981. Military ruler Ziaur Rahman didn’t allow Sheikh Hasina or any member of Bangabandhu family to enter the house till his death.  Consequently, on the day of her return, Sheikh Hasina had to arrange prayer session on the road outside the house. It was a sheer cruelty and flagrant violation of human rights. She couldn’t seek justice for the brutal killing of her father and family members due to Indemnity Act passed in the parliament in a bid to protect the killers permanently. Moreover, the homeless daughter of Bangabandhu was barred from entering her only abode in Dhaka.  Now, numerous human rights activists and organisations are seen protesting different incidents accusing the government’s various bodies of violating human rights but during that time, they didn’t show minimum sympathy to Bangabandhu’s daughters. These ‘self declared human rights defenders’ had turned their eyes blind and remained mum in this regard.  A few days later, the house constructed on loan from the House Building Finance Corporation (HBFC) was auctioned as the installments of around Tk 12,000 were not paid. Sheikh Hasina had paid the money to get the house back.  The Dhanmondi-32 house was not merely a residence of a national leader. Since Bangabandhu and his family members had started living in the house on October 1, 1961, it turned into the centre of Bangalees’ nationalistic struggle. Bangabandhu took all policy decisions of Awami League from the drawing room of this house after discussing with his colleagues. He gave all instructions to the mass people gathered in front of the house through a hand mike from its balcony.  This house is a national asset and it cannot be compared to any structure. Feeling the historic importance of the house, Bangabandhus’s two daughters declared that this house would be turned into a museum.  Despite having no shelter in the city, they made the house as ‘Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Memorial Museum’, which reminds Bangalees of their most proud moments and painful chapter of national life, so that they can get inspiration to uphold the spirit of independence and take lessons to turn around from the most difficult situation in life.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5LXN1bi5jb20vcHJpbnR2ZXJzaW9uL2RldGFpbHMvNjg5OTE1L0EtaG91c2UtdGhhdC1zcGVha3Mtb2YtbmF0aW9uJUUyJTgwJTk5cy1wcmlkZS1hbmQtcGFpbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Example video title will go here for this video  MEMPHIS, Tenn. — As Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month continues, the Chinese community is working to chronicle and preserve its 150 year history in Memphis.  “Our Memphis history starts in 1873,” said Emmi Dunn, Secretary at the Chinese Historical Society of Memphis and the Mid-South.  Dunn has been researching the history of the Chinese community, and says a laundry ad in a newspaper was the first indication of when Chinese immigrants first made their way to Memphis. Chinese immigrants likely made their way to the Mid-South after work completed on the transcontinental railroad according to Dunn.  “They were still building railroads in the South and Texas, so lots of Chinese came down here,” said Dunn.  Several immigrants began opening laundromats because it did not require a lot of money to do so. The first Chinese store opened in 1880, the first restaurant opened in 1894, several in and around Beale Street.  “They have a much more diverse customer base. During segregation time, that’s where black people can get some service,” said Jinliang Cai, President of the Chinese Historical Society of Memphis and the Mid-South.  At one point, so many Chinese business were on Beale Street, a local newspaper referred to that part as “Chinatown.”  “It consisted of a few stores, grocery stores, cafes and laundries,” said Dunn, “It was not a Chinatown per se as you would think of in San Francisco or New York.”  The Chinese business influence reached its height in the 1920s and 30s. Business began to leave the area over time for different reasons, including after Dr. Martin Luther King’s assassination. Laundromats eventually began to disappear after washing machine’s became automated.  “Eventually really the downtown started to decline after that, and really it started to trickle to the suburbs,” said Cai.  Most businesses only stayed open for a couple of years on Beale Street. The Chop Suey Cafe stayed open for close to 50 years, but closed its doors in 1967. This is why the Chinese Historical Society of Memphis and the Mid-South are trying to preserve that history and stories just like it.

"assassination","1965-08-06","Not Discerned","{""Montgomery"", ""Alabama"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 11:05:31","Martin Luther King Jr. forgot Coretta’s birthday in 1965, but she said she didn’t mind.  “In the light of my own involvement and commitments,” she said, “it is not too difficult for me to understand and forgive little things like this which do occur, sometimes.”  Coretta Scott King was thirty-eight years old, the mother of four children, ages two, four, seven, and nine. In 1965, she spent more time than ever out of the house, working for the movement, beginning in March with a series of Freedom Concerts on the West Coast. In April, she traveled to Detroit for a dinner honoring and raising money for Rosa Parks, who had struggled to find work, first in Montgomery and later in Detroit, and who had suffered deteriorating health.  In May, Coretta King spoke at a gathering of the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom in Chicago. And on June 8, she was the only woman to speak at an anti–Vietnam War rally attended by more than fifteen thousand people at Madison Square Garden in New York City.  Earlier that year, at an SCLC retreat, Martin had asked Coretta to speak about Vietnam and whether the organization had a responsibility to take a stand against the war. “I talked about how it would continue to drain resources from education, housing, health, and other badly needed social programs,” she recalled. “I said, ‘Why do you think we got the Nobel Prize? It was not just for civil rights . . . Peace and justice are indivisible.’ ”  It was Coretta’s passion for activism that had first attracted Martin, back in 1952, when she had been enrolled at the New England Conservatory of Music and he had been pursuing his doctorate at Boston University. On their first date, they had discussed the merits of capitalism versus communism. He explained that he intended to devote himself to the fight for racial justice. Coretta, having attended the progressive and integrated Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, thought she would have the edge on this well-bred young man when it came to passion for social reform. She was pleasantly surprised to find that he seemed determined to fight racial discrimination, even if he was not yet sure how to do it.  King was attracted to Coretta in no small part because her experience as an activist exceeded his own. Thirteen years later, however, she expressed frustration with her limited role in the civil rights movement.  “My husband feels it important that one parent remain at home to give them [the children] security,” she told a reporter in Seattle. “But I would like to make a more complete witness by marching, and, if necessary, going to jail.”  Martin, on the other hand, almost never spent time home alone with the children when Coretta traveled. Instead, the Kings relied on friends and family to watch Yolanda, Martin, Dexter, and Bernice. In a memoir written years later, Coretta recalled a conversation in which she told Martin she wanted to take a more active role in the movement:  During one exchange, he told me, “You see, I am called [by God], and you aren’t.”  I responded, “I have always felt that I have a call on my life, too. “I’ve been called by God, too, to do something [. . .]”  Still not convinced, Martin turned to me and said, “Well, somebody has to take care of the kids.”  “No problem,” I said. “I will do that.”  Looking a bit crushed, he asked, “You aren’t totally happy being my wife and the mother of my children, are you?”  “I love being your wife and the mother of your children,” I said. “But if that’s all I am to do, I’ll go crazy.”  During a 1965 television interview conducted at his home, King was asked if he had educated his wife on matters of activism. “Well, it may have been the other way around,” he said. “I think at many points she educated me. When I met her, she was very concerned about all the things we are trying to do now. . . I wish I could say to satisfy my masculine ego that I led her down this path, but I must say we went down together, because she was as actively involved when we met as she is now.”  James Karales for Look magazine / Library of Congress King at home with family, 563 Johnson Avenue, Atlanta, fall 1962  The Feminine Mystique, written by Betty Friedan, had been published in 1963 and remained enormously popular in 1965, describing the widespread dissatisfaction among American women, and encouraging them to declare: “I want something more than my husband and my children and my home.” At one point in 1965, Coretta began working on an essay for the first issue of a magazine called New Lady, a publication that billed itself as “the Negro woman’s guide to a new way of life.” By the time she finished, the article ran to thirteen pages of text and photos. Coretta must have been proud of it because she mailed a copy to Rosa Parks. “Women have been the backbone of the whole civil rights movement,” Coretta wrote in the article. “Women have . . . made it possible for the movement to be a mass movement.” It was a simple fact, but nevertheless an overlooked one.  In Montgomery, Parks had sparked the bus boycott and Jo Ann Robinson and the Women’s Political Council had launched it. Aurelia Browder, Claudette Colvin, Susie McDonald, and Mary Louise Smith had served as plaintiffs in the federal lawsuit that led to the Supreme Court decision that desegregated the city’s buses. Ella Baker had long served as one of the movement’s best organizers. Diane Nash had helped initiate the Freedom Rides and cofounded SNCC. Septima Clark and Fannie Lou Hamer had led the push for voter registration in much of the Deep South. And then there were countless women such as Coretta Scott King and Juanita Abernathy who endured many of the same perils as their husbands while receiving little credit for their work, work that included not only marching and organizing but also taking care of children, filling in for their husbands, and advising their spouses on matters of strategy, leadership, and politics. In addition to the other challenges, Coretta Scott King ran her household on a modest budget, because her husband insisted that most of the income from his speeches and writings go to the SCLC.  In her article for New Lady, Coretta offered her clearest explanation of how she navigated a path that left many ambitious women of the 1960s feeling lost and angry. Over and over, she returned to the themes of compromise and perseverance. She began: “While my husband was being prepared for the job that he is doing, I feel that I was being prepared also to be the helpmate… I feel very strongly that it was meant to be this way.”  At Antioch College, as she recalled in the article, she had insisted on doing her student teaching in the Yellow Springs Public Schools, along with her white classmates. But the Yellow Springs schools were segregated, and Antioch officials wanted her to travel nine miles to an integrated school in Xenia, Ohio. She “felt like crying” when her teachers and classmates refused to support her. “Then I thought, ‘I am a Negro and I am going to be a Negro the rest of my life. I just can’t let this kind of thing get me down . . . I’ll have to accept this.’ . . . So I made the compromise,” she wrote.  She accepted even worse, according to Hosea Williams, who said that he witnessed King’s cruel treatment of Coretta on more than one occasion. “ ‘Shut up and go ahead in the back room!’ ” Williams said he heard Martin yell at Coretta. “She would get up quietly and go on back. Martin had told her many times.”  Williams was a frequent critic of Coretta, but if the men in the SCLC dismissed King’s wife, the women admired her. They saw a woman fighting to balance her dedication to her family and her causes. Xernona Clayton, an SCLC staff member from Atlanta who traveled at times with Coretta, said she was always impressed by Coretta’s calm determination. For Coretta to leave Atlanta and perform a concert, she not only had to rehearse, arrange her travel, and promote her appearances but also had to make sure the children would be cared for in her absence. Before leaving, she would type a list of meals for the week, including desserts. Even when she was on the road, without consulting notes or a calendar, Coretta knew when the children had doctors’ appointments, piano lessons, and haircuts, Clayton said, and Coretta checked in frequently to make sure nothing was forgotten.  “Coretta Scott King was a disciplinarian,” wrote her son Dexter, “took no guff from hers or any others. Froze you with a look.”  Carole Hoover, another SCLC staff member, said it was clear that Dr. King respected and relied on his wife’s opinion when it came to high-level questions of strategy. “She was very much engaged with those things that were important to him,” Hoover said. “He genuinely valued her thinking.” People in the office heard rumors about King’s infidelity, and specifically about his relationship with Dorothy Cotton. “That rumor floated several times,” Hoover said. “I don’t think Coretta ever bought into that.”  But others in the SCLC did buy into it. When King returned to Atlanta from one of his frequent trips, he usually went to Cotton’s home before going to his own house, said Stoney Cooks, an SCLC staff member. It was understood within the organization that the relationship had been going on for years. “Only the people who were very close to him even knew about it,” Cooks said, and Cotton “didn’t flaunt it.”  Nevertheless, the women of the SCLC saw Coretta and Dr. King as powerful partners, said Edwina Smith Moss. “They didn’t profess to be perfect, and Coretta was such an asset to Dr. King,” Moss recalled. “She was strong, and she came out of the South . . . If Dr. King ever wanted to quit, she wouldn’t have let him. She was not fearful. If she had been, it would’ve shown . . . She understood the FBI wanted to break them up . . . Coretta had steel. Coretta had a sense of the movement. You couldn’t have done that without a real sense of the movement. She was the power behind the throne . . . She was not the person to break. If she was going to have a battle, it was going to be with Dr. King, and it was not going to be in public . . .”  “It is a great temptation,” Coretta wrote, “to demand more of my husband’s attention. We women are like that. But I have had to realize that he belongs to the world and therefore cannot be the same kind of husband and father that he would like to be.” Doing her part for the cause of freedom, she said, included explaining to the children why their father went to jail and why he wasn’t home as much as other fathers and why, sometimes, he didn’t come home when the family expected him. “I have considered my own role very important from the beginning,” she wrote.  The assassination of President Kennedy frightened her, Coretta wrote. The assassination of Malcolm X frightened her more. She felt stuck, “weak and depressed,” after Malcolm’s death. She reminded herself, she wrote, that she and her husband and all humans were coworkers with God, building a world of peace and love. As she concluded in her article: “When you decide to give yourself to a great cause, you must arrive at the point where no sacrifice is too great. This is the first demand that is made of us in our great struggle for civil rights. I shall stand with Martin Luther King, Jr., my husband, as he faces them.”  Throughout the spring and summer, King hustled from speech to speech, interview to interview, city to city, protest to protest, until August 6, 1965, when he arrived in Washington, D.C., to meet with President Johnson and witness Johnson’s signature of the Voting Rights Act. Joining King were Roy Wilkins, James Farmer, and Rosa Parks, among others. Coretta King watched the ceremony on television. She was home taking care of Marty and Dexter, who had both had their tonsils removed. Martin had been so busy that Coretta had never found time to tell him about the scheduled surgeries. It was one of the few occasions, she wrote years later, when she felt sorry for herself.  “I felt very supportive of his being there,” she wrote, “but I also had this feeling of being alone, of being entirely by myself.”  Later that day, outside the White House, five hundred people protested U.S. policies in Vietnam. King made no public comment on the anti-war demonstration. His focus was on the historic new law, which, he said, would “go a long way toward removing all the obstacles to the right to vote.”  It was, he told reporters, as he prepared to fly home to Atlanta, “a shining moment.”  Adapted from Eig’s biography King: A Life published by Farrar Straus & Giroux  Contact us at letters@time.com.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vdGltZS5jb20vNjI4MDMwMi9tYXJ0aW4tbHV0aGVyLWtpbmctanItbWFycmlhZ2UtY29yZXR0YS1zY290dC1raW5nL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

""Film is a powerful mass media where history is being preserved in its every frame ...and that's why film archieve is necessary for the country for understanding the history, tradition and culture of a particular nation"", he said.    The Information and Broadcasting Secretary made this comment while attending as the chief guest at a function organised by BFA marking its 45th founding anniversary of Bangladesh Film Archive in city's Agargaon.  Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman had a dream to set up a film archive in the country and he had taken necessary steps in this regard in January, 1975, the secretary told the function.  But the initiative was halted after the brutal assassination of Bangabandhu on August 15 in 1975, he added.  Describing the incumbent Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina as a cinema loving personality, the information secretary said the present film archive has been set up due to the personal initiative of Sheikh Hasina.  About the importance of the film archive, the information secretary said ""Bangladesh Film Archive now has got a complete shape and there is more opportunity to make it better, adding ""Since the Liberation War is our great achievement ..Bangladesh Film Archive will have to collect and preserve all the audio-visual documents of the Liberation War to enrich its importance.""  Former Director General of Bangladesh Film Archive and former Information and Broadcasting Secretary Kamrun Nahar, Additional secretary (film) of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting Dr M Jahangir Alam and noted cultural personality Syed Salauddin Jaki also spoke on the occasion.  Project Director Dr M Mofakharrul Iqbal gave welcome address with Bangladesh Film Archive Director General M Jashim Uddin in the chair.

"assassination","1865-04-14","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 18:00:53","Funnily enough, Allan Pinkerton spent little of his time as a detective, even though the term “private eye” is based on his logo. Most of what he did was espionage. With, you know, a little union-busting, as a treat. Still, he clinched the concept of a private detective outside the realm of the hired thug. Even though, yeah, Pinkerton agents are also hired thugs; just ask the person Wizards of the Coast sent Pinkertons after recently. But Allan Pinkerton did also thwart assassination plots against Lincoln before his inauguration, so that’s a net positive, at least?  In fact, the first fictional detective predates the public familiarity with Pinkerton. Charles Dickens created Mr. Nadgett in Martin Chuzzlewit, which I have not read on the grounds of hating Dickens and almost all of his works. Still, the golden era of pop culture fiction is the mid-twentieth century, definitely post-Pinkerton, and “private eye” is a phrase that gets used a lot. Whether it’s Sam Spade, James Rockford, or Kinsey Milhone, they’re all private eyes. And pop culture is full of them, of many varying types.  The first one to come to mind for most people is the hard-boiled. Your Sam Spade, your Philip Marlowe, your Mike Hammer. Tough men—they’re men—who drink a lot and are always on the verge of bankruptcy and generally have a secretary they sexually harass in some way. Probably there is a set of Venetian blinds in their office. They will almost certainly be shot at, if not actually shot, at least once in any given case. The bodies will just keep piling up.  At about the same time, we got a lot of Gentleman Detectives. (Also generally men.) Your Lord Peter Wimsey, your Hercule Poirot, your Nero Wolfe. Some of these were not officially set up as detectives and just kind of tripped into a lot of cases, but also there were some who had fancy apartments and were hired by expensive people. Nero Wolfe has a staff—enough so that he almost never leaves the brownstone. Though a lot of Gentleman Detectives were also globetrotters; how many countries did Hercule Poirot solve cases in?  Starting in about the ‘70s, you also got what is kind of the response to the two classic types. Jim Rockford, obviously—he’s hard-boiled, but in a more modern way. He’s got a bit of sensitivity. No secretary at all, because he can’t afford one, and he gets clients based on his ad in the phone book. It’s as though everyone realized there’s room for variety. You can have, say, a man in very short shorts who’s basically a rich man’s pool boy. You can have a man with crippling Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. You can have the man who’s slipping into the life of a fictional character.  Who, in fact, was created by a woman in-universe, because that’s an extension of where detectives could go. Nancy Drew isn’t the first of the female detective characters, but she’s a good start. But as late as 1982, Laura Holt invented a male boss because no one wanted to hire a woman. (Which the first Enola Holmes book plays with, I discovered this week.) Yes, there’s Miss Marple, who’s kind of in the Gentleman Detective range—the Little Old Lady equivalent, along with Jessica Fletcher and others. Phryne Fisher, who predates the hard-boiled men on the timeline, inasmuch as she’s in the ‘20s, but who is a modern addition to the genre.  And, of course, there’s more than just white dudes. You’ve got Easy Rawlins, John Shaft, and Precious Ramotswe. And all of those are just in the English-speaking world; if you expand out of that, you’ve got dozens, if not hundreds. The private detective has a lot of choices. From Adrian Monk to Veronica Mars and beyond. You’ve got Harry Dresden, private detective/wizard. You’ve got Jessica Jones, private detective/superhero. Dirk Gently, private detective/whatever he needs to be on a given day. Fiction’s full of them, and they just keep going. Ask Benoit Blanc.

"assassination","2023-05-09","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 13:21:00","Those saying Israel's latest assault in Gaza was just a bleeding exercise in futility fail to understand the real purpose behind it.  Polls released by major Israeli channels after the ceasefire, which was signed on Saturday night, prove beyond doubt the operation achieved its main goal from the government’s perspective: the popularity of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition was on the rise.  Netanyahu was trailing in polls to his opposition rivals days before the bombing campaign, dubbed “Operation Shield and Arrow”, was launched on 9 May with a series of overnight assassinations.  Five days of Gaza bleeding - in which 33 Palestinians, including six children, were killed - and the ongoing bleeding of Netanyahu’s coalition was miraculously cured. Mission accomplished.  Netanyahu has restored his image as “Mr Security” - not the ailing prime minister accused of leading his country into a dictatorship with his government’s controversial judicial overhaul plan.  Stay informed with MEE's newsletters Sign up to get the latest alerts, insights and analysis, starting with Turkey Unpacked  “The only achievement of this military operation is the security of Netanyahu’s coalition,” Zehava Gal-On, former head of the leftist Meretz party, told Middle East Eye.  'In the absence of any strategy, all Israelis can expect is more rounds of violence with shorter breaks between them' - Daniel Rothschild, head of Israeli think tank  Strangely enough, this miraculous recovery has nothing to do with how Israelis feel about the outcome of the five-day assault.  A poll conducted by Channel 12 a day after the ceasefire showed that 42 percent of respondents believed the operation strengthened Israeli deterrence.  Around 44 percent believed it made no difference and five percent thought it made it worse.  This indifference is echoed by politicians on both sides of the spectrum.  Members of the coalition, both from Netayhu’s Likud party and his allies in the far-right Religious Zionism party, sound unhappy with how the operation ended. They wanted more.  The same goes for Avigdor Lieberman, leader of the opposition right-wing Yisrael Beytenu party, who blamed Netanyahu for creating a “Hezbollah in the south” by not attacking Hamas, the Palestinian group which rules over Gaza.  On the left, politicians repeated the same knee-jerk reaction of non-judgmental support for the attacks.  Labor MP Efrat Rayten, for example, was more worried about how it was going to be “difficult to explain” the images of children killed in Israel’s air strikes, rather than questioning the purpose behind the bloodshed.  No vision for Gaza  In Israel, the very same people who doubt the merit and logic of the operation once it ends are the ones who support it as it unfolds - and politically reward Netanyahu for launching it.  And there’s very little reasonable explanation behind this.  Perhaps it’s not fair to expect reason from people who follow a leadership that lacks any meaningful logical or moral considerations.  Gaza: How this 85-year-old Palestinian experienced two Nakbas Read More »  After all, what do you expect of a military and political establishment that refers to the killing of Palestinian children as “collateral damage”?  But many in Israel have learned that after almost 20 years of 15 futile “operations”, a blockade, mass killings, “targeted eliminations,” and the destruction of Gaza - along with thousands of rockets fired into Israel’s south and centre in response - this is not the answer.  However, no one offers an alternative, and more bloodshed seems to be the only option.  Those same people who support the operation know that the next one is just around the corner. They know that the Islamic Jihad “senior leaders” that Israel assassinated will be replaced quickly.  “In the absence of any strategy, all Israelis can expect is more rounds of violence with shorter breaks between them,” said Daniel Rothschild, head of the Institute for Policy and Strategy think tank and former military general.  “As long as Netanyahu applies his tactical approach of divide and rule between Palestinian Authority (PA) in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza - effectively weakening one and strengthening the other - and unless they come up with a holistic strategy that includes both the West Bank and Gaza, we are doomed to have more tactical rounds coming one after another,” Rothschild told MEE.  People react following an Israeli air strike in Beit Lahia in the northern Gaza Strip, on 13 May 2023 (NurPhoto via Reuters)  His views are shared by Yair Golan, the Israeli military's former deputy chief of staff and now a politician with the left-wing Meretz party.  “What have we gained from this operation? Nothing,” Golan told MEE two days into the ceasefire.  Since Israel unilaterally “disengaged” from Gaza in 2005, pulling out troops and settlements that were in the strip since it was occupied in 1967, little has changed in the strip, he added.  The military presence was replaced by an air, land and sea blockade, which turned the densely populated enclave into the largest “open-air prison”, according to human rights groups.  The military also launched repeated operations in Gaza from 2006 onwards, killing more than 6,000 Palestinians in less than two decades.  Under Netanyahu’s leadership, this policy has meant that Israel is effectively working against its interests by weakening the PA and strengthening Hamas, Golan argued, keeping the region ""stuck in an endless confrontation"".  The deterrence equation  The declared aim of the latest assault was the Islamic Jihad, the second biggest armed group in Gaza behind Hamas.  This is the third time since 2019 that the group has been singled out in attacks by Israel in which Hamas was not targeted.  Despite widespread speculation, Hamas - which has a much bigger arsenal than the Islamic Jihad - did not publicly confirm if they joined other armed groups in launching retaliatory rockets at Israel.  During a visit two days after the assault to Ashkelon, one of the cities that came under heavy rocket fire, Netanyahu hailed the success of the operation.  He said it ""changed the deterrence equation"" with armed groups in Gaza - an assertion dismissed by Golan.  ""Once again, we just bought time, limited time. How long?"" he asked, arguing that the question on whether Hamas joined the fighting or not was irrelevant.  “Hamas was in no rush to reach a ceasefire. They offered the Islamic Jihad moral support and probably arms and weapons as well,"" he explained.  Cracks in the protests?  Another collateral damage of the five days of bloodshed in Gaza might be the months-long mass protest movement against Netanyahu's “regime change”.  Since January, hundreds of thousands of Israelis have been rallying weekly against a judicial overhaul proposal presented by the government which critics say will weaken the country's judiciary.  In late March, Netanyahu postponed the plan amid widespread strikes and protests. He said he wanted to give room for talks with the opposition in the hopes of reaching a consensus regarding the plan.  No progress has been made in the discussions so far, and the issue is expected to come back to the fore of Israeli politics by the end of May once the state budget is passed.  Gaza: Israel's unity over new aggression won't last Read More »  The common struggle against what many views as a pending dictatorship seemed to unite Israelis otherwise divided by many schisms in the relentless demonstrations from January until now.  But that might change after the Gaza assault.  One of the leading groups in the demonstrations, Brothers in Arms, a grouping of reservists, was quick to publish a poster in support of the “brothers in arms” bombing Gaza - a statement that drew the ire of others in the protests movement.  Another dominant protest group, Black Flags, decided to cancel the weekly demonstration last Saturday as the fighting was still unfolding, an announcement ignored by some protesters who showed up to the rallies anyway.  These could be small cracks in the thin armour of Israeli opposition solidarity that can be easily fixed. Or they could be the beginning of a crisis: war with Palestinians could see many in the opposition camp rally around national ""defence"" and break the momentum of protests.  For Netanyahu's government, this could be the big collateral benefit of his bombing campaign.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pZGRsZWVhc3RleWUubmV0L25ld3MvaXNyYWVsLWdhemEtYXNzYXVsdC13aW5zLW5vdGhpbmctbmV0YW55YWh10gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"assassination","2023-05-01","Not Discerned","{""Winchester"", ""Nevada"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 02:53:04","Gotham Knights has the lowest budget of any superhero show on The CW.  By TeeJay Small |  Not all studios can tout the seemingly endless budget of Marvel or Star Wars projects, despite sharing intellectual property with some of the biggest names in modern media. For the CW network, series such as The Flash and Stargirl have long been criticized for their low CGI budget, failing to live up to the standards of their box office blockbuster counterparts such as Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice and Justice League. According to a recent write-up in The Hollywood Reporter, The CW’s latest effort to bring Gotham City to life, Gotham Knights, has the lowest budget of any DC series ever produced by the network and still may face cancellation.  As the ongoing Writers Guild of America strike begins to loom over the industry, many networks are looking to cut costs. For the CW, this means gutting a number of their scripted series and pivoting to more unscripted content, with shows like The Winchesters and Kung Fu each getting the axe this past week. Despite touting such incredibly low budgeting numbers to produce, Gotham Knights seems to be next on the chopping block, as the series continues to bring in less viewing traffic than its sister series Superman and Lois.  Gotham Knights centers around a socio-political firestorm kicked off by the aftermath of Batman‘s untimely death. Without the Dark Knight himself to instill fear in the hearts of the city’s most dangerous felons, the city quickly devolves into chaos, leaving District Attorney Harvey Dent and a band of mismatched fugitives to attempt to keep the city from boiling over while investigating the true nature of Bruce Wayne’s assassination. The series is currently in the final weeks of airing its first season, with the last two episodes set to hit the small screen on Tuesday, May 23, and Tuesday, May 30, respectively.  Despite this news being reported to The Hollywood Reporter from a close source, many fans have already been made aware of the staggeringly low budget for Gotham Knights simply by watching the show. A tertiary glance at fan engagement on a number of online platforms such as Twitter and Instagram reveals dozens, potentially hundreds of critiques of the show’s costuming, props, and failure to secure more convincing shooting locations. While most television shows utilize movie magic to cover up their shortcomings, it seems that Gotham Knights lacks the budget to do even that.  Gotham Knights seems to serve as a cautionary tale for networks like The CW amid growing concerns that other entertainment unions, such as the Directors Guild and IATSE, may soon engage in a strike as well, proving the age-old adage that “you get what you pay for.” By seemingly trying to save money by skimping on production costs and overall quality, the network has actually lost money by failing to entice viewers to flock to the show.  If Gotham Knights does wind up getting canceled in the coming weeks, it surely speaks more to studio failure than it does to the general public’s gauged interest in Batman and Batman-adjacent projects. Though film outings such as Matt Reeves’ Batman and Todd Phillips’ Joker sport significantly higher budgets than the average CW television show, both films serve as contemporary examples that stories told in the setting of Gotham can and will attract huge viewing numbers if you’re willing to put in the time, effort, and money to make them worth exploring.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdpYW50ZnJlYWtpbnJvYm90LmNvbS8_cD01MTgzNDnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","1983-06-22","Not Discerned","{""Rome"", ""Lazio"", ""Italy""}","Wed 17 May 2023 15:29:46","After the Vatican opened an investigation last December and the Italian parliament is currently considering its own probe, the city of Rome too has announced a new inquest into the 1983 disappearance of Emanuela Orlandi, at the time the 15-year-old daughter of an employee of the Prefecture of the Papal Household whose family lived in a Vatican apartment.  Orlandi’s case recently was popularized by the Netflix series “Vatican Girl,” and most observers credit the flurry of new investigations, at least in part, to the heightened public interest created by the documentary.  The chief prosecutor of Rome, roughly equivalent to a district attorney in the United States, announced the new investigation this week. It will be the third such probe by the Roman procurator’s office in the 40 years since Orlandi disappeared. The first unfolded between 1983 and 1997, and the second from 2008 to 2015.  That second investigation was closed in 2015 by the chief prosecutor of Rome at the time, a veteran Italian jurist named Giuseppe Pignatone, who today serves as the president of the civil tribunal of the Vatican City State.  The Italian news agency Ansa reported Tuesday that the Vatican’s Promoter of Justice, Alessandro Diddi, has turned over files from his investigation to Stefano Luciani, the official in the Rome procurator’s office now responsible for the new Orlandi review.  Pietro Orlandi, the brother of Emanuela who’s devoted his life to the search for the truth about his sister’s disappearance, told reporters the Vatican’s cooperation with the Roman probe is a departure from the past.  “It’s positive that the Roman procurator has acquired the acts from the Vatican, because for the first time there will be collaboration, always denied in the past, between the Holy See and the [Italian justice system],” he said.  That’s a charge recently echoed by Giancarlo Capaldo, a retired Roman official who led the last investigation of the Orlandi case that was closed in 2015. In April, Capaldo told an Italian television program that in his experience there had been “no cooperation by Vatican with investigations of Italian magistrates.”  Among other things, Capaldo has claimed that in 2012 officials of the Vatican gendarmes offered to help identify Orlandi’s remains in exchange for assistance with removing the body of a mob boss who’d been entombed in a Roman basilica. Both officials involved have denied that claim, suggesting Capaldo misunderstood their intent.  The Vatican has always rejected charges of stonewalling investigations into the Orlandi case. In a 2012 statement from then-Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi, he insisted the Vatican has cooperated with Italian authorities from the start.  The 40th anniversary of Orlandi’s disappearance will fall next month, on June 22.  Veteran Italian journalist Fabrizio Peronaci, writing in Corriere della Sera, has suggested that the new probe of the Orlandi case by the procurator’s office could be combined with one already underway into the January 1984 murder of Katy Skerl, a 17-year-old girl at the time whose body was discovered in the countryside outside Grottaferrata, a small community southeast of Rome.  Over the years, some theorists have linked Skerl’s murder to the Orlandi case, noting, among other things, that Skerl was a classmate in a Roman high school of Snejna Vassilev, the daughter of one of three Bulgarian functionaries in Rome initially accused of complicity in the 1981 assassination attempt against Pope John Paul II.  Marco Accetti, a 67-year-old Roman photographer whose claims to have played a key role in the Orlandi affair have generated both interest and skepticism over the years, has asserted Skerl was killed on the order of a faction in the Vatican, opposed to the group which orchestrated the kidnapping of Orlandi, as part of an internal power struggle. To date, however, he’s offered no proof.  The Italian Chamber of Deputies voted overwhelmingly in March to authorize an inquest on behalf of parliament, and it seemed at the time the Senate would follow suit. Momentum stalled, however, after Pietro Orlandi went on Italian TV to play an audio recording of an ex-Roman mobster accusing the late Pope John Paul II of conniving in a pedophile ring in the Vatican, and suggesting that Emanuela Orlandi might have been killed to cover it up.  Those suggestions caused a furor, with Pope Francis twice publicly rejecting the charges against his predecessor. Key members of the senate have either withdrawn or modified their support for a probe in the wake of the controversy, with a vote now not expected until June at the earliest, and possibly after the summer.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vYW5nZWx1c25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvdmF0aWNhbi92YXRpY2FuLWNvb3BlcmF0ZXMtcm9tZS1vcmxhbmRpLWludmVzdGlnYXRpb24v0gFXaHR0cHM6Ly9hbmdlbHVzbmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy92YXRpY2FuL3ZhdGljYW4tY29vcGVyYXRlcy1yb21lLW9ybGFuZGktaW52ZXN0aWdhdGlvbi9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","1968-04-04","Not Discerned","{""Memphis"", ""Tennessee"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 17:19:47","PVAMU’s 8th President to Spring 2023 Graduating Class: ‘Remember the dream of MLK and the courage of Rosa Parks to use your voice.’  PRAIRIE VIEW, Texas (May 17, 2023) – Ruth J. Simmons, Prairie View A&M University’s eighth president, still remembers when Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee, on April 4, 1968. The news was a shock and a turning point for her. Facing challenges and difficulties as a college student herself at an HBCU decades ago, she shared about wanting to quit.  The death of MLK, however, woke her up.  “I felt unworthy to complain about picayune inconveniences when one so dedicated to making the world better for me was willing to give his life,” Dr. Simmons shared at the PVAMU’s 141st Spring Commencement Convocation on May 13. “So, I renewed my commitment to do what I could in my turn to make a better world.”  Simmons, immediate past president of PVAMU, returned to campus Saturday morning to give an impassioned speech to over 1,000 candidates for graduation. She acknowledged the “perils of the present moment” facing the graduating class who had already faced so much in the last few years alone.  “You leave this place at a moment when we’re all reckoning with unimaginable events that point to the confused state of the polity,” she told an enraptured audience. They are embarking into the world at a time when “hard-fought rights are being re-litigated.” She, nevertheless, encouraged them of their place and purpose in such a world: “I, for one, am confident that through your intelligence, your generosity, your open-mindedness, and your tolerance, you are prepared to play an important role in healing this nation.”  The 2023 class has overcome so much more than the typical college graduate of the past: a global pandemic, post-pandemic uncertainty, racial and social upheaval, economic instability, historic inflation, and an ongoing war in Ukraine, disrupting daily life worldwide.  At times emotional, tissues clutched in hand, Simmons, who stepped down earlier this spring, spoke about her undiminishing love for the University and her abiding faith in its students.  She highlighted their courage, endurance, and resilience: “Having come through this difficult period, your intelligence and your character have been tested. Your adaptability and fortitude have held up, and you stayed on the path to this achievement that we celebrate today.”  But above all, she urged them to remember. “Remember your freedom and the opportunities you enjoy have been purchased at a great cost. You owe to those who came before you and those who will follow you the obligation to pay attention, to speak up for access, and to do all you can to ensure that the freedoms we enjoy today are preserved and enhanced.”  Graduating, she said, is more than tossing your cap into the air on graduation day or hanging the framed diploma on the wall for all to see. “Don’t just do that. Remembering the burden of being educated, raise your voice. Raise it in defiance of those who’ve returned this country to 19th-century ideas and biases,” Simmons told the audience to thunderous applause.  Let the history of Prairie View further inspire you, she told them. “Let your conduct reflect the amazingly courageous history of this place.” Be true to yourself and hold strong to your values, not forgetting where you come from or who you are, Simmons advised. “Having studied here, you carry with you a stronger sense than most of what could be lost if we give in to the forces of darkness,” she said. “Those who benefit from the bravery of pioneers who removed barriers to freedom and opportunity do not get a free pass.”  Perhaps like the 1968 assassination of MLK, the 2020 murder of George Floyd may alight this next generation graduating into a precipice of a world on edge. Simmons charged graduates: “It is your turn to stand up, to insist on equal rights for all and defy those who would debase and violate the rights of others.”  Despite thundering storms delaying the ceremony and forcing it to be relocated to the University’s “Baby Dome,” 1,008 students walked the stage. And despite the challenges of the last four years, PVAMU awarded 837 bachelor’s, 153 master’s, and 18 doctorates. In addition, nearly one-third of undergraduate graduates identified themselves as first-generation college students.  This spring, PVAMU also produced its biggest class of doctoral candidates, thanks to various University measures, such as recruiting more highly qualified faculty for tenured and tenure-track and increasing tuition and fee support, James M. Palmer, provost and senior vice president for Academic Affairs, said in a press release.  This semester’s notable graduates include Jordan Poston, known as “Mr. Senior” from Dallas, who is headed to a Fortune Global 500 company. Another Spring 2023 grad, Zian Richmond, is a criminal justice major who graduated a year early and is headed to law school. Houston native Morgan Redd join the MD Anderson Cancer Center as an oncology stem cell transplant nurse.  Simmons did not doubt the graduating students’ abilities and potential to reach the highest heights. However, she called on them to go beyond professional goals and career aspirations to become the next frontiers who change the world.  “Those who came before you at Prairie View, who fought for your rights, now speak to you across the ages,” Simmons said. “Can you hear them?” The crowd of thousands sat in silence, listening. “Listen to their voices and contemplate their good works. This nourishment gives you the courage beyond what you thought you possessed.”  Where would we be today, she posed, without the dream of MLK and the courage of Rosa Parks? “You’ve been truly privileged to have the education that others’ efforts afforded you,” Simmons said. “Now, go. And make it mean something. Use your voice.”  By Christine Won  PVAMU Commencement Statistics (Spring 2023)  Number of degrees (by college/school)  College of Agriculture and Human Sciences: 58  School of Architecture: 59  Marvin D. and June Samuel Brailsford College of Arts and Sciences: 237  College of Business: 150  Whitlowe R.

"assassination","2023-04-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 15:17:45","The international community and Tunisians alike have condemned the sentencing as another authoritarian move by President Kais Saied, but experts predict that the sentencing will result in neither sanctions nor mass unrest  A senior leader of the Tunisian opposition, former Speaker of Parliament Rached Ghannouchi, was sentenced to a year in prison on Monday on charges of supporting terrorism and inciting violence.  Ghannouchi, who leads the Islamic democratic Ennahda party, was arrested last month. He denies the charges. The international community has condemned the arrest as another authoritarian act by Tunisia’s President Kais Saied.  A press statement from the US State Department last month said that the arrest of Ghannouchi and other political opponents represents “a troubling escalation by the Tunisian government against perceived opponents.”  Foreign Minister of Germany Annalena Baerbock told reporters that she was very concerned about Ghannouchi’s arrest and that the “democratic achievements in Tunisia since 2011 must not be lost.”  The Tunisian Revolution of 2010-2011 led Tunisia to become a democracy. In 2021, Saied issued an emergency declaration dismissing the government and suspending the parliament. He ruled by decree for about a year until a new constitution was approved in 2022 that concentrated power in the hands of the president. Saied’s government has become increasingly authoritarian since then.  Alice Gower, director of geopolitics and security at the Azure Strategy advisory firm, told The Media Line that Saied has consistently used arrests of high-ranking politicians to fend off potential threats. Ghannouchi’s sentencing “is yet another example of the repressive nature of the Saied government,” she said.  She noted that the international community’s relative silence on the issue has led to “what has been perceived as tacit indifference to what goes on in Tunis.”  Ghannouchi is popular among the Ennahda party faithful, but his reputation among the population at large is more mixed  Hamish Kinnear, a Middle East and North Africa analyst at the risk intelligence company Verisk Maplecroft, said that Ghannouchi’s prison sentence will spark outrage among supporters of the Ennahda party but is unlikely to inspire significant unrest in the country.  “Ghannouchi is popular among the Ennahda party faithful, but his reputation among the population at large is more mixed,” he told The Media Line.  Kinnear said that Ennahda was part of several post-revolution governments that failed to deliver economic prosperity. The party was also accused of involvement in the assassination of two popular secular politicians in 2013. Although party representatives have consistently denied the accusations, “many leftist Tunisians hold Ennahda responsible,” Kinnear said.  Saied has already isolated international donors and investors due to his erratic policies. The country’s economic woes are now so dire that it needs financial support from elsewhere, despite Saied’s claims to be working to avoid indebtedness.  Similarly, Gower said both Ghannouchi and his party “have faced waning popularity for failure to embrace the younger generation and address the country’s economic plight.”  She said that Ghannouchi’s sentencing will increase the sense of instability in Tunisia, aggravating the country’s economic distress.  “Saied has already isolated international donors and investors due to his erratic policies. The country’s economic woes are now so dire that it needs financial support from elsewhere, despite Saied’s claims to be working to avoid indebtedness,” Gower said.  Although Western governments have expressed alarm at the arrest of Ghannouchi and other opposition figures, Kinnear said that it is unlikely that governments would turn to sanctions or a halt to economic aid, since such measures “would risk undermining Tunisia’s political stability.”  He explained that the Biden Administration is currently lobbying for Tunisia to secure an International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan and sign up for a program of structural reforms that could resuscitate its struggling economy. The work currently being done to stabilize Tunisia makes it unlikely that the US would do anything that might push “the country closer to the economic abyss,” he said.  Gower said that the chaos currently going on in Tunisia is the result of the international community’s ongoing refusal to intervene. She called on the US, a major supplier of aid to Tunisia and central figure in the IMF, to “demand answers and change before authorizing further military aid and the rollout of an IMF loan program.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWVkaWFsaW5lLm9yZy90b3Atc3Rvcmllcy90dW5pc2lhcy10b3Atb3Bwb3NpdGlvbi1maWd1cmUtc2VudGVuY2VkLXRvLWEteWVhci1pbi1wcmlzb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Such a law, signed a few months after the triumph of the Cuban Revolution, allowed large estates´ belongings to local landowners to be delivered to rural workers who have received other benefits denied until then, such as access to healthcare, education, and housing.  The Agrarian Reform and a series of measures taken by the new Cuban government marked the beginning of the country’s economic recovery, which plunged into rural precariousness due to the obsolete production systems.  The date also recalls the assassination of peasant leader Niceto Pérez on May 17, 1946, in the hands of landowners in Guantánamo´s mountain region, some 950 kilometers from Havana.  In that historical context and due to the organization’s results in the Cuban countryside, the National Association of Small Farmers (ANAP) was founded on a similar date in 1961.  President Miguel Díaz-Canel recognized the role of that agricultural force in satisfying the population’s needs and reducing dependence on foreign markets through the proper use of their lands.  jrr/iff/oda/lld","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBsZW5nbGlzaC5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLzA1LzE3L2N1YmEtY2VsZWJyYXRlcy1mYXJtZXJzLWRheS1hbmQtZmlyc3QtYWdyYXJpYW4tcmVmb3JtLWxhdy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2023-05-01","10:00:00","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 02:45:12","“Justice is what the judge ate for breakfast.” — Jerome Frank, legal realist philosopher  SIX recent judicial orders — one order of the Supreme Court and five orders of the Islamabad High Court — in two days (May 11 and May 12), restraining the authorities from arresting Imran Khan, has converted the PDM-PPP government into hard core legal realists of the kind captured by the quote above. These judicial orders have also, post-facto, reaffirmed the alleged correctness of the sole legal and judicial strategy of the government’s legal team: whenever you lose a case partly due to your own incompetence, tell everyone that the judge has been influenced.  But is the PDM-PPP government correct in its judicial fairytale analysis that these allegedly ‘defective’ judicial orders are the result of an alleged bias in favour of Imran Khan? Or is Imran Khan correct in constructing his alternative judicial fairytale analysis that these decisions are strictly a product of the application of the Constitution and the law, without any extraneous influences and predispositions?  The paradox: After over 100 registered cases, an assassination attempt, assaults on his home, the large-scale prosecution of PTI leaders and workers, a proxy case seeking his political disqualification on the non-disclosure of his alleged daughter, Tyrian White, and even a case questioning his nikah, can anyone seriously doubt that Imran Khan is the subject of systemic political vendetta and state repression?  If we are honest enough to admit these facts then what is so legally extraordinary about the relief of no-arrest and protective bail, for a very limited period only, granted by the SC and IHC to Imran Khan? The government cannot seriously challenge the legality of these six judicial orders for two main reasons.  Firstly, the SC order dated May 11, 2023, was passed by a three-member bench which also included Justice Athar Minallah. Is the government now alleging that even Justice Minallah is ‘biased’, someone whom the government only recently celebrated as a great dissenting SC judge? Secondly, no serious lawyer or legal scholar can question the legality of such limited and temporary no-arrest relief by the SC and IHC.  Therefore, the main focus of their critique has been on the extraordinary speed and generosity of this legally correct relief — this speed and generosity, they allege, tends to show bias in favour of Imran Khan. Therefore, the apparent paradox of how such judicial relief can be both legally and constitutionally correct but might exhibit alleged bias needs to be explained.  Most judges cannot escape the constraints imposed by the Constitution and the law.  Beyond fairytales: In periods of relative democratic rule in Pakistan, even in highly politicised cases, most judges cannot escape the constraints imposed by the Constitution and the law. But this is subject to the two caveats of contested interpretations and judicial discretion.  Both the Constitution and the law allow judges to adopt differing judicial interpretations of the Constitution and the law, and thus also allow judges enough judicial discretion to either deny or grant judicial relief to individuals in similar circumstances. This ‘undefined space’ created by differing interpretations and judicial discretion is filled with fear, desires and visions which judges experience and express in their judicial role.  As Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes observed: “The life of the law has not been logic: it has been experience. The felt necessities of the time, the prevalent moral and political theories, intuitions of public policy … even the prejudices which judges share with their fellow-men…”.  Judicial interpretations and discretion, although controlled by the Constitution and the law, are also influenced by the fear of losing judicial power or privileges, by judicial desires and visions coloured by their political and social views and class, gender and geographical backgrounds. Like all of us, judges are also human beings.  Fear, desires and visions: Two key judicial cases document both the acceptance and denial of the Pakistani judge’s apprehension of the coercive power of the state. Firstly, the contempt case against retired Gen Mirza Aslam Beg (1993), where it was alleged that he had sent a message to the SC not to restore the dissolved National Assembly of the Junejo government. Gen Beg recanted and the SC went into denial.  Secondly, the challenge to the Eighth Constitutional Amendment recorded in the Mahmood Achakzai case (1997). In this case, Justice Saleem Akhtar records the admission of Syed Sharifuddin Pirzada that he had, by implication, threatened CJP Anwar-ul-Haq with his removal as CJP if Gen Zia was not given the power to amend the Constitution.  After recording this damning admission, the SC slumbered in silence. These are actual cases of interference, but generally, there is apprehension among judges of the tremendous coercive power of the state, especially the deep state. No wonder, the cases of missing persons have witnessed judicial silence, with former CJP Iftikhar Chaudhry and former CJ Athar Minallah and the IHC being exceptions.  Moreover, judges, while interpreting the Constitution, which is replete with political ideology and values, appear to act like applied political theorists, as David Robertson explains in his book Judges as Political Theorists. Political and social views influence judicial desires and visions, which in turn structure legal interpretations. Isn’t the US supreme court publicly perceived as being composed of bitterly divided Republican and Democratic judges?  Also, judges are influenced by their class, gender and geographical backgrounds. Can anyone deny that the rich and middle classes have a better chance of getting much speedier relief than the poor? Further, one of the differences between the judicial interpretation of Article 63A of the Constitution, by Justice Munib Akhtar and Justice Mandokhail might stem from their geographical origins. A judge from Balochistan might show more sympathy in giving politicians the benefit of the doubt.  The key is not to wish for super human judges without predispositions but for greater judicial accountability and transparency to expose biases and a more representative judiciary which represents our (all too human) predispositions.  The writer is a lawyer.

"assassination","1983-10-19","Not Discerned","{""WoundedKnee"", ""SouthDakota"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 22:08:00","by Nuri Muhammad  BELIZE CITY, Mon. May 15, 2023  In 1956, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), J. Edgar Hoover, convinced US President Eisenhower of the ominous danger faced by Americans from homegrown dissidents, and justified the use of an undercover operation known as Counter Intelligence Program (COINTELPRO), “to suppress and destroy all radical subversives in the US”.  Historical records show that J. Edgar Hoover executed a series of covert, and often illegal, projects conducted by FBI agents, aimed at “investigating and disrupting dissident political organizations”. According to these records, “eighty-five percent of the resources of this program were expended on infiltrating, disrupting, marginalizing, and/or subverting groups suspected of being subversive; such as communist, socialist, militant black groups, women’s groups, civil rights groups and the American Indian Movement”. Hoover ordered his agents to “expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit or otherwise neutralize” these groups. So paranoid was Hoover about these supposed internal enemies that he even saw Dr. Martin Luther King, a pacifist, as an enemy of the state, and therefore ordered wire taps and constant surveillance to keep an eye on Dr. King.  COINTELPRO had specific methodologies to reach its objective, one of which was the tried and tested tactic of turning ‘brother against brother’. They played on internal ego conflicts, whispering in the ear of contending brothers and exaggerating small things into big things; then supplied the weapons to murder when the arguments got out of control  We also learned from the records how they infiltrated the Nation of Islam (NOI) and were involved in the assassination of Malcolm X, the armed attack on the American Indian Movement at Wounded Knee in South Dakota, and the infiltration of the Black Panther Party (BPP) which resulted in the death of Bobby Hutton, Fred Hampton and Mark Clark. (For further research, use Google).  While COINTELPRO officially ended in 1971, suspicions persist that the program’s tactics continued informally and may have also been used in the Caribbean. Unlike the US, where the use of the Freedom of Information Act has provided their citizens access to documents which revealed information about US covert activity, in the Caribbean, unfortunately, no such access exists, despite Freedom of Information provisions in our laws.  We know that between 1968 and 1975 there was a revolutionary fervor running throughout the Caribbean. These groups were nationalistic, black, socialist, and a mixture of the educated and the grass-roots working together for a common purpose. To name a few, there were the Joint National Action Committee (NJAC) in Trinidad, New Jewel Movement (NJM)in Granada, Working Peoples Alliance (WPA) in Guyana, and the United Black Association for Development (UBAD) in Belize, with others in Jamaica, Antigua, and Barbados. These groups were not only of security interest to their respective governments, but also drew the attention of British and American intelligence.  According to the record, they used sleepers who posed as dedicated followers but were secretly agents of the US/UK intelligence network. These sleepers were sophisticated and very subtle in their execution of their scheme. They are the “whisperer” described in the Qur’an, who withdraws after his whisper, thereby making you think it was your idea. These agents from this intelligence network are very subtle, sometimes appearing as good advisors.  We know again from antidotal observation rather than recorded facts, that agents must have been involved in exaggerating the differences between Maurice Bishop and Bernard Corde which ultimately resulted in a faction, led by Corde, assassinating his friend and comrade, Prime Minister Maurice Bishop, on October 19, 1983. This was the power of the tactic of COINTELPRO to stop or suppress revolutionary movements as they rose in the west. Understanding that this strategy continues to be used to destroy black movements, we can better understand how the rift between Bishop and Corde occurred, which led to Bishop’s assassination, and ultimately created the enabling environment for the invasion of the US forces, which brought the New Jewel Movement government to an abrupt end.  In the case of Belize, it will take some ambitious young Belizean American, using the Freedom of Information Act in the US, to access some of the documents of embassy officials and CIA agents to see how Belize was being viewed by COINTELPRO in the late sixties, early seventies.  It’s not clear how the operation was unfolded in Belize, but the results tell us that there must have been some scheme afoot to exacerbate ego conflicts and splinter unity of action. How else could you explain how intelligent men like Norman Fairweather, Bert Franklin, Evan X Hyde, Roy Cayetano, Bert Tucker, Dr. Joe Palacio, Nuri Muhammad and so many others could go through the seventies and eighties, nineties, and now 23 years into the new century, and not have formed some kind of front to advance the cause which they all for so long have espoused?  How else could you explain this monumental failure of these intellectual activists to not forge something larger than themselves? These so-called cultural/nationalistic/religious leaders did not deliver a collective response to the problem. The horrible condition of young black males (Creole/Garifuna) in 2010, is our collective burden.  Clearly, we can’t blame the implosion of all these groups in the Caribbean to the machinations of British/American intelligence activities, because the endemic ego conflicts played an equally important role in our eventual demise. But one cannot discount the role of agents within these organizations in turning brother against brother. It worked in the Congo, Kenya, and Algeria and in the US with the NOI and the BPP.  Some say that, clearly, Black Power as defined by the radicals of the 60s and 70s has been defeated in the eyes of the US Justice Department and has been relegated to the dust bins of undercover programs, some dating back to the 1920’s. They say Black Power is no longer a national security concern, and there is no need to focus on the specter of “Black Power” anymore; “Black Power” is no longer a foundation or platform for social action in America. In fact, in Belize, “Black Power” is just a T-shirt fashion statement.  The new focus today is on narco-trafficking, money laundering, gun-running and human trafficking, but the biggest of them is the specter of radical Islam; therefore, Belize is filled with intelligence operatives who are not necessarily in the employ of the US Justice Department, yet they remain an essential source of information to the NSC.  There are the conscious agents and there are the un-conscious agents; we know what a conscious agent is about, but it’s the un-conscious agents that slip between the radar because they themselves don’t realize that they are inadvertently, agents of the intelligence network.  I remember interviewing former CIA agent Phillip Agee, in 1990, on KPFK Radio in Los Angeles. He was at one time stationed in Guatemala City and had some knowledge of the agency’s activities in Belize. He said that the CIA used a number of ways to assess a “point of interest” before executing any action. One way of assessing the climate of a target group is their public statements. Studying newspaper articles, editorials, op-eds, and monitoring radio talk shows is the major way the CIA assesses the climate in places like Belize. He said the CIA (and its British counterpart) may have tons of information gathered through its massive surveillance apparatus, but will only engage that information when the US or UK national security interest is threatened.

"assassination","2023-10-07","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 16:41:34","Original hospitals deal concessionaire, former Vitals Global Healthcare director Ram Tumuluri, has claimed in an official disclosure to the US authorities that he was threatened repeatedly by former Office of the Prime Minister chief of staff Keith Schembri and others that he would meet the same end as journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia if he didn’t sign the hospitals’ concession over to Steward Healthcare.  In a whistleblower complaint to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleging violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, obtained by the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and shared with partners in Malta, The Shift and The Times of Malta, Tumuluri claims the threats were made by former Office of the Prime Minister Chief of Staff Keith Schembri, then-health minister Konrad Mizzi and one of the concession’s original brokers, Shaukat Ali, among others.  Tumuluri also says that former prime minister Joseph Muscat played a role in what Tumuluri claims was a forced handover of the concession to Steward for €1. Muscat denies being a part of such coercive tactics, which is contradicted by Tumuluri’s filing and affidavit. Schembri has also vociferously denied Tumuluri’s claims.  Tumuluri has also accused Steward Health Care of engaging in unlawful activity with the government of Malta and insists he only signed the concession over because he was made to fear for his life by government officials and others working on their behalf.  The 505-page complaint includes an affidavit from Tumuluri and hundreds of pages of supporting documents, such as internal emails, contracts and project plans.  He said they lasted through the period of her assassination that October until Tumuluri says he eventually caved into demands in December 2017 and signed the concession over because he feared his life and that of his family would be in danger if he didn’t.  Schembri, according to Tumuluri’s disclosure, warned him that “[he] is the law in Malta” and that no agreement could protect Tumuluri’s interest.  He allegedly warned that “if the government could silence a vocal reporter like Ms Caruana Galizia, Mr Tumuluri should be very careful not to make enemies with the government”.  ‘You want us to be a friend, not a foe’  Tumuluri alleges in his SEC whistleblower disclosure that at one meeting at Castille, Schembri told him, “You know what happened with Daphne [Caruana Galizia] and you don’t want to end up in that position. You want us to be a friend, not a foe.”  Tumuluri discloses several meetings in which he alleges his life had been threatened and claims he was pulled aside afterwards from one such meeting, by Mizzi, who warned him, “Don’t force these guys to go to that level.”  At another such meeting, Tumuluri says Shaukat Ali and his son Ali, who he says were “acting as de facto agents and representatives of the government of Malta”, told Tumuluri that although he had signed up to do business with a European Member State, Malta was, in fact, a “mafia state” where “the cost of life is less than €10,000.”  Chillingly, during these meetings in the presence of both Schembri and Mizzi, Shaukat Ali told Tumuluri, according to his account, that if the government could “get rid of someone like Daphne” Tumuluri was of no significance and that it could also “get rid of” him quite easily.  Tumuluri claims that it was only under duress and “as a result of the repeated threats of violence and other harm, including the threats of murder conveyed to him in December 2017” that he ultimately gave in to the government’s demands that he sell Bluestone’s shares in Vitals Malta to Steward.  ‘We need to silence Daphne’ – Schembri  In his official SEC filing, seen by The Shift and investigative partners, Tumuluri says he feared that if he did not comply with the government’s demands, he would be murdered by “agents of the government of Malta”.  He claims that over the course of the preceding year he “had various frightening and otherwise uncomfortable experiences with the government of Malta”.  He details how on one such occasion in early 2017, he was present at the Office of the Prime Minister with Mizzi and Schembri.  Tumuluri says that Schembri turned to him and stated, “in sum and substance that ‘we need to silence Daphne [Caruana Galizia]’, and asked whether “we know anyone who could get rid of her.”  Tumuluri says he thought Schembri had been joking at the time and disregarded the comment.  He says he began changing his mind after he said he witnessed the detonation of a car bomb on the other side of the road while he was driving in Malta in February 2017.  Tumuluri was presumably referring to the car bomb in Msida that left Romeo Bone severely injured on 20 February 2017.  Tumuluri says he later heard Schembri “chastise the individual or individuals responsible for the car bomb that Mr Tumuluri had witnessed on the grounds that the operation had not been conducted properly”.  Cardona ‘cancelled Sicilian hit on Caruana Galizia’  Soon after that, in March or April 2017, Tumuluri claims he attended a meeting at the Office of the Prime Minister with Schembri, Mizzi, and Asad Ali, the latter being the son of one of the hospitals’ original dealmakers Shaukat Ali.  Tumuluri reports in his FCPA filing that Schembri told him at that meeting that former minister Chris Cardona, one of Caruana Galizia’s frequent targets, “had paid the Sicilian mafia €10,000 to assassinate Ms Caruana Galizia” but that Cardona the next day developed a case of “cold feet and had cancelled the directive”.  Schembri, Tumuluri says in his sworn statement, said that Cardona had never gotten the money back after cancelling the directive.”  Tumuluri claims he had the impression that Schembri made the statements “as an amusing anecdote and to mock Cardona for being weak,” but despite this, he still “felt deeply uncomfortable, concerned, and intimidated”.  An investor’s hand  In another disturbing incident Tumuluri reported to the SEC, he says was present for a meeting at the OPM in December 2017 where several individuals, including Schembri and Armin Ernst, had discussed a court injunction filed by Ashok Rattehalli, then a consultant and medical director for Vitals.  Rattehalli had been employed with Vitals since June 2016 and had received an option to purchase 5% of Vitals Malta shares as part of his compensation.  But since Tumuluri could not permit Rattehalli to exercise the option because a deal to hand the concession over to Steward had not yet been brokered, Rattehalli had sought and obtained an injunction to prevent the transfer of Vitals to Steward, as The Shift had revealed.  According to Tumuluri’s filing, “During this meeting, Schembri received a telephone call from Asad Ali reporting that Asad Ali had threatened Rattehalli by advising him that he would cut off Rattehalli’s hand and use his hand to apply a signature to a document to withdraw the injunction if he did not withdraw the injunction himself.”  Rattehalli, Tumuluri said, “immediately withdrew the injunction as directed”.  Muscat’s involvement  Although Muscat insists he played no role in the deal, Tumuluri insists that “Schembri’s demands that Mr Tumuluri sign the share-purchase agreement [with Steward] were made at the direction of Muscat”.  During the meeting, Tumuluri claims that “Muscat entered the room and demanded that the share-purchase agreement be signed that same day”.  Tumuluri claims that Muscat told him, “Do I need to butt your heads together to get this signed?”  Before leaving the room, Tumuluri says, Muscat advised Schembri that he expected the share-purchase agreement to be signed within half an hour.  Schembri then, according to Tumuluri’s account, asked him to step outside the room with him because he did not want to say certain things in the presence of lawyers.  “Schembri began discussing political relationships among ministers and advised that the government had to oust Mr Tumuluri from the concession and had to replace him with Ernst and Steward.”  Tumuluri says Schembri further advised that Muscat had asked Schembri to speak to him personally “to ensure that the share purchase agreement was signed the same day”.  Tumuluri further claims that Muscat had instructed Schembri to remove Tumuluri and Bluestone and to transfer the concession to a then-undisclosed third party, which later turned out to be Steward, with which the government had already struck a deal.  That meeting was in December 2017, and Schembri, Tumuluri says, told him the government wanted to announce the concession’s transfer to Steward by Christmas.  He says at that point, Schembri warned that if he “wanted to do business in Europe or elsewhere again, he should stay on his ‘nice’ side, as opposed to his ‘nasty’ side, he should remain a ‘friend’” and not a ‘foe’, and he should sign the share-purchase agreement immediately.”  Brown bags and a board position  Nor was Steward chairman and CEO Ralph de la Torre, who has not replied to the investigation’s questions, spared in Tumuluri’s US SEC filing, with Tumuluri claiming de la Torre told him that he had no problem with bribing government officials if need be.  “In touting Steward’s supposed competitive advantage in Malta, de la Torre told Mr Tumuluri that Steward was not as rigid as Partners Healthcare International [Tumuluri’s former partner for the deal],” according to the filing.  Along such lines, Tumuluri adds that “de la Torre boasted that he could issue ‘brown bags’ to government officials if necessary to close transactions, insinuating that he would bribe officials of the government of Malta.”  Tumuluri says he did not respond to the “brown bag” comment and did not agree to assist Steward with any violations in Malta of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. He said he did, however, agree to further discussions with de la Torre, subject to a non-disclosure agreement, to explore the possibility of Steward serving as an equity investor in Vitals Global.  Tumuluri claims that through the latter part of 2016 and the entirety of 2017, Ernst conspired with Steward CEO Ralph de la Torre, along with government officials and others, to steal his confidential and proprietary information, such as business models, intellectual property, and other trade secrets; defame him; undermine his business relationships; disrupt financing to Vitals Malta; and to strip him of his interests in Vitals Malta and the hospital-services concession.  He also claims the collusion was aimed at blocking him and Vitals from extending his Malta business model to other countries in Europe and thwarting the implementation of his business model through an information-technology platform in the United States and abroad.  Tumuluri says he also had information from Shaukat Ali that, during the discussions between the government and Steward around September and December 2017, de la Torre also had travelled to Malta and had met with Prime Minister Muscat on multiple occasions.  He also says that, according to Schembri, Ernst had been in discussions with the new Health Minister, Chris Fearne, about taking the concession from Vitals Malta.  He claims Shaukat Ali told him that de la Torre offered Muscat a seat on the Steward Board once he left his government position. Tumuluri provided no follow-up to the discussion he says Ali had cited.  ‘Completely false and baseless’  When it comes to the threats Tumuluri says he was made, Keith Schembri perhaps features most prominently. When asked to react to the accusations being made in his respect, Schembri labelled the accusations as “completely false and baseless”.  Schembri, in a stark contradiction to Tumuluri’s claims, insists it was Steward Healthcare that approached “us” at the United Nations General Assembly in New York to express their interest in acquiring Vitals in Malta.  “It is unfortunate that Mr Tumuluri has chosen to make such outrageous claims, and I question his motives behind doing so.  “It appears that he has a vivid imagination and is attempting to associate this case with the tragic murder of Mrs Caruana Galizia, which is absolutely horrendous.”  “I vehemently protest against these baseless allegations and false claims made by Mr Tumuluri.”  On his part, Muscat says it is a “clear and uncontested” fact that he was “made aware of Steward’s interest in the concession after Steward and VGH reached an agreement in principle on the concession”.  He adds, in a complete contradiction of Tumuluri’s filing, “I categorically deny being at any stage involved in the negotiations between the two sides, either directly or indirectly, and I never asked for any position.”  “I also emphatically deny ever organising and/or attending any meeting whatsoever involving Steward and VGH. I challenge anyone to produce any sort of evidence to the contrary.”  “As stated numerous times, my only interest was in a seamless transition between the two entities as an agreement was reached.”  Like Schembri and Muscat, Shaukat Ali also denied the accusations Tumuluri is levelling, saying, “I can confirm that the allegations of wrongdoing, as stated in your communications, against me and my son are entirely false and vehemently denied.”  He also warned he was “liaising with our lawyers both in Malta and abroad who are monitoring the situation, including the publication of defamatory material. Should the need arise, we will not hesitate to take legal action.”  As for Konrad Mizzi, the former health minister insisted Tumuluri had not been coerced into handing over the hospitals’ concession.  “I reject any claim that Mr Tumuluri was being bullied into exiting, and deny even being aware that he received any threat if he did. If a statement was made stating that I was present, then it is false.”  “At the time of the transfer of shares, government had approved the transfer onto Steward after the Office of the Prime Minister was approached with a proposal for the acquisition of the concession. My understanding is that as private parties, the transferor and transferee were free to accept or decline to reach an agreement, and an agreement was in fact reached.”  When contacted about the filing, Steward Health Care International said it “emphatically rejects any and all allegations of impropriety made by Tumuluri, who is widely reported and recognised as an international fraudster, against the company and its directors.”  “We consider these accusations malicious, self-serving and entirely without merit. We reserve our rights to take legal action to defend our position and reputation.”  Click on the following links for the full replies supplied by Keith Schembri, Shaukat Ali, Konrad Mizzi and Joseph Muscat.

This classic cut-and-paste method of ransom note construction presumably emerged as means of evading minds like that of Trista Ginsberg, a document analyst specializing in handwriting at the Secret Service. She appears in the Great Big Story above, which comes to focus on one facility at the Service’s headquarters in particular: the International Ink Library.  “The Secret Service has the largest ink library in the world,” says the video’s narrator. Its more than 12,000 samples of different inks include “pens, bottled ink, and printer cartridges.” These come in handy when, say, “someone writes a threatening letter to the president.”  A document analyst like Irina Geiman samples the letter’s ink, and then, by comparing it to the inks in the library, “she can figure out what kind of ink was used, and, hopefully, it can help solve the case.” Geiman also explains a less dramatic type of case that comes across her desk rather more often: at-home inkjet counterfeiting of $20 bills.  Though that may not be the highest example of the counterfeiter’s art, the art itself motivated the creation of the Secret Service in 1865 as a branch of the U.S. Treasury Department. “Following the Civil War,” says the Secret Service’s FAQ, “it was estimated that one-third to one-half of the currency in circulation was counterfeit.” It was in 1901, after the McKinley assassination, that “the Secret Service was first tasked with its second mission: the protection of the president.” Hence the cultural currency of the image of the would-be president assassin evading governmental pursuit while laboriously assembling his missives one letter at a time — surely reason enough for the Secret Service to have put together a top-secret International Glue Library.  via Messy Nessy  Related content:  How Ink is Made: The Process Revealed in a Mouth-Watering Video  Books Made with Disappearing Ink Strategically Fade Away  Anatomy of a Fake: Forgery Experts Reveal 5 Ways To Spot a Fake Painting by Jackson Pollock (or Any Other Artist)  Read the CIA’s Simple Sabotage Field Manual: A Timeless Guide to Subverting Any Organization with “Purposeful Stupidity” (1944)  Based in Seoul, Colin Marshall writes and broadcasts on cities, language, and culture.

The hitman and another man were sentenced to life imprisonment.  Today, Trang Provincial Court sentenced 52 year old Charinrat “Chuan” Kruthirat to death after he and two others were found guilty of murdering 54 year old Somsak “Lawyer Wao” Ochuenjit in 2021. Chuan was the mastermind behind the lawyer’s assassination.  At 7.40am on May 4, 2021, a gunman fatally shot Somsak while he was working in a rubber plantation near his home. Somsak had not long before told his family that he was receiving death threats.  Somsak was assassinated after leading a campaign for the right to agricultural land for poor farmers in Wang Wiset district. Tensions were high between local farmers occupying oil plantations without valid leases, government agencies, and private companies backed by politicians.  Four days later, the Asia director at Human Rights Watch, Brad Adams, called on the Thai authorities to investigate the murder…  “Thai authorities should not just stand by while grassroots activists in southern provinces are being murdered for standing up for their communities.”  “The Thai government should urgently conduct a credible and impartial investigation and bring those responsible for Somsak’s death to justice.”  Human Rights Watch pointed out that five land activists have been killed in southern Thailand over the past decade.  Two years on, justice is set to be served for Somsak after the court sentenced Chuan to death for planning the murder and hiring a hitman.  The court also sentenced the former village chief of Moo 10, Chalermwat “Yai Pua” Nokroorak, to life imprisonment for his role in the planning of the murder although he did not participate on the day itself.  The hitman, Saranyoo “Nil” Kueboonsong, was at first sentenced to death for shooting dead Somsak. However, because the hitman ratted out Chuan – helping the police’s investigation hugely – and plead guilty, his sentence was reduced to life imprisonment.  All three men were taken into custody after the verdict was read yesterday and taken to Trang Provincial Prison.  Follow us on :              Somsak’s family travelled to Khao Phra Wiset Temple after the verdict was read to burn incense and to inform Somsak’s spirit to rest easy because justice had finally been served.

"assassination","1963-11-22","Not Discerned","{""Jackson"", ""Mississippi"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 08:00:00","Mississippi legislators have enacted a law that would create a new judicial system covering the state's capital city, Jackson, in place of the current county court system.  Set to take effect July 1, 2023, the move by a Republican-dominated legislature has been criticized by opponents as creating a ""separate and unequal"" court system that is not answerable to the majority-Black community it would seek to govern.  The law was justified by supporters as an effort to curb the city's crime level, which includes one of the highest murder rates in the nation. But the move is the second time in as many months that state legislatures have taken highly visible actions to effectively disenfranchise Black voters: On April 6, the Tennessee House of Representatives expelled two Black members who represented mostly Black districts.  As a sociologist who studies race and ethnicity, I have closely followed these moves by the states. Throughout U.S. history, I see three main periods of legislative disenfranchisement in which legislative bodies have voted to expel members. These events have been shown to be a form of ""white backlash"" working to keep Black officeholders out of power and their constituents powerless without representation.  Reconstruction and legislative disenfranchisement  After the Civil War, the United States engaged in a brief period known as Reconstruction, which lasted from 1865 to 1877. It was a deliberate attempt to reverse the negative effects and legacies of slavery by enacting economic, political and social policies that directly benefited the formerly enslaved Black people of the South.  The efforts included formally abolishing slavery nationwide, guaranteeing equal protection of the laws to everyone regardless of race, and allowing formerly enslaved people to vote. In addition, formerly Confederate land was set aside for newly freed Black families, and former Confederate soldiers were not allowed to vote.  But after Tennessee politician Andrew Johnson, who had been Abraham Lincoln's running mate in 1864, took office upon Lincoln's assassination, many of those provisions of Reconstruction were reversed. Former Confederate combatants were allowed to vote, and confiscated Confederate property was returned to its prewar owners.  In addition, Johnson and Congress made it easier for defeated Confederate states to rejoin the Union, which allowed former Confederate leaders to regain their previous positions of power in local and national governments.  Georgia was originally readmitted to the Union in July 1868. But just two months later, in September, the Democratically controlled Georgia Assembly, with a total of 196 members, voted to expel all 33 of its Black elected officials.  Immediately upon making themselves into an all-white legislature, the remaining assembly members enacted the infamous Black Codes. These codes created a unique set of laws specific to the newly freed Blacks, including limiting the types of work they could do.  Collectively, the legislative expulsion of the Black officials and the imposition of the Black Codes served to effectively disenfranchise the Black voters of Georgia. Senator Henry McNeal Turner, one of those expelled, defiantly asked: ""Am I a man? If I am such, I claim the rights of a man.""  Interim Archives/Getty Images  The civil rights era  Another major effort to disenfranchise Black Americans came during their next major push to achieve political, social and economic equality: the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s. Opponents targeted two prominent civil rights activists who had been elected to represent their communities: Adam Clayton Powell Jr. and Julian Bond.  Bond was elected as a Democrat to the Georgia House of Representatives in 1965, but on Jan. 10, 1966, the Democratically controlled House voted not to seat him, citing his criticism of U.S. involvement in Vietnam and support of students who were protesting the war. A year later, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Bond's First Amendment rights had been violated and ordered that he be seated. But for that intervening year, his constituents had no voice in their state legislature. Bond ultimately served in the Georgia legislature for another two decades, before turning to teaching and activism.  Powell's situation was different. He was the first African American to be elected to Congress from New York and from any state in the Northeast. Starting in 1945, he represented the district that included the majority-Black Harlem neighborhood of New York City. He became one of the most important Democrats in the House, but in the mid-1960s, he found himself embroiled in personal and financial scandals.  After the election of 1966, the House created a committee to investigate Powell's actions and refused to seat him until the committee's report was complete. The report found fault, but committee members were split on the proper discipline for Powell. Ultimately the whole House voted to keep him out.  Powell sued to reclaim his seat, saying the House had excluded him unconstitutionally. He also won the special election in April 1967 created by the vacancy but didn't take his seat because of the lawsuit. The removal of Powell meant that Harlem was the only congressional district in the nation without a representative from 1967 to 1969.  In 1969, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the House had acted unconstitutionally by refusing to seat Powell. By then, Powell had also won the 1968 regularly scheduled election and had been seated, though without the seniority and committee positions that would normally have been given to someone who had continuously been a House member.  Black Lives Matter movement  In the aftermath of the George Floyd killing, a new social movement emerged across the United States. With this new activism came another ""white backlash"" in the form of legislative disenfranchisement.  In May 2022, Tiara Young Hudson, a long-serving Black public defender, won the Democratic primary for a judgeship in Jefferson County, Alabama. More than half of the county's population is nonwhite. Facing no opposition in the general election, she was expected to win and take office.  But two weeks after the primary, a state judicial commission, divided along racial lines, eliminated the position she was a candidate for and created a new judgeship in the majority-white Madison County.  Hudson immediately sued to block the shift, saying it violated the Alabama Constitution and only the state legislature had the authority to reallocate judgeships. In March 2023, the state supreme court dismissed Hudson's complaint, effectively stripping the Black people of Jefferson County of a representative they had elected to be their voice on the state's roster of judges.  And on April 6, 2023, the Republican majority of the Tennessee House of Representatives voted to expel two Black legislators – Justin Pearson and Justin Jones – for participating in a protest calling for gun legislation following yet another mass shooting.  Within days, both Pearson and Jones had been temporarily reinstated by processes for filling vacant seats, but still face special elections to fully reclaim their seats. Their alleged violation was participating in a protest against the legislature's rules – but their real violation, I believe, was that they were Black, outspoken and pushed for change.

Trevor Jackson (Grown-ish, Superfly) will co-star. Myriad Pictures is shopping the project to buyers here in Cannes this week.  Mace is the harrowing story of two very different types of cops – a veteran officer Mace (LaBeouf), dangerous and corrupt, and Virgil Woods (Jackson), a young rookie who believes that he can change the system that fosters cops like Mace from within. It’s inspired by the recent racial injustice on the streets of America and Woods refuses to be bullied and pits his principles against the amoral Mac. Woods risks everything he believes to stop Mace from destroying the city when Mace unleashes a gang war to cover up his crimes. Everyone around Mace is in danger as Mace plays his game and tries to conceal his tracks, no matter the cost.  The Meyers Media Group production is projected to start later this year in New Jersey with additional casting underway. Lawrence Steven Meyers, John Evangelides, Randy Dannenberg and Robert Maclean will produce. Brendan McDonald and Kirk D’Amico will serve as exec producers. Tribune Pictures is onboard to co-produce and co-finance the film.  LaBeouf can next be seen in Francis Ford Coppola’s highly anticipated Megalopolis and he’s just joined the cast of David Mamet’s Assassination. He most recently wrapped production on Abel Ferarra’s Padre Pio which follows the life of the now saint during his time as a monk in Puglia, Italy.  Amiel is an award-winning director, writer and producer who garnered international acclaim for The Singing Detective and followed that with Queen of Hearts, which premiered in Cannes. His further credits include Tune in Tomorrow, with Keanu Reeves and Peter Falk, Copycat with Sigourney Weaver and Holly Hunter and Entrapment with Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones.  Myriad Pictures’ D’Amico said, “We are delighted that Shia LaBeouf will head up the cast for this film which explores the underbelly of a police precinct in contemporary New Jersey. We think that with Jon Amiel at the helm and Shia in the title role that the result will be extraordinary and exciting.”  Meyers added, “We are really excited to have assembled such a package. With the amazing screenplay, Jon at the helm, and Shia joining Trevor as the lead actors, it is an irresistible creative coup for us. Thankfully, the investment from Robert’s Tribune Pictures enabled us to greenlight the film in time for Myriad to bring it to the Cannes Market.”  Shia LaBeouf is represented by John Crosby Management and attorney Matt Saver.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL2RlYWRsaW5lLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1L3NoaWEtbGFiZW91Zi10by1zdGFyLWluLWFjdGlvbi10aHJpbGxlci1tYWNlLWZyb20tZGlyZWN0b3Itam9uLWFtaWVsLW15cmlhZC1waWN0dXJlcy1jYW5uZXMtbWFya2V0LTEyMzUzNjk3ODgv0gGPAWh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvc2hpYS1sYWJlb3VmLXRvLXN0YXItaW4tYWN0aW9uLXRocmlsbGVyLW1hY2UtZnJvbS1kaXJlY3Rvci1qb24tYW1pZWwtbXlyaWFkLXBpY3R1cmVzLWNhbm5lcy1tYXJrZXQtMTIzNTM2OTc4OC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","1997-07-15","Not Discerned","{""Miami"", ""Florida"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 20:32:17","The new FBI sci-fi series Class of ‘09 fails to make a strong impression, despite boasting some signature FX (on Hulu) aesthetics.  By Valerie Ettenhofer · Published on May 17th, 2023  Welcome to Up Next, a recurring column keeping an eye out for the best new shows on the horizon. This week, TV critic Valerie Ettenhofer checks in with a review of FX’s new drama Class of ’09.  Imagine if AI technology could solve crimes. Free from the bias and limited resources of police, unburdened by human anger or fear, a computer that’s a dozen steps ahead of its users might just be the key to a safer world. Except, if you’ve watched or read any number of sci-fi stories in this vein, from Minority Report to the works of Isaac Asimov, you’ll know that this concept is little more than a shiny pipe dream. The new FX/Hulu series Class of ’09 attempts to mine this familiar plot once more, but its sleek style and intriguing cast aren’t enough to make it feel fresh. Instead, the series loses itself in a hazy sort of mystique that, in the four episodes available for review, fails to coalesce in a meaningful way.  Tom Rob Smith’s (Assassination of Gianni Versace) Class of ’09 tells the story of a particularly important class of FBI recruits, jumping back and forth between their time at Quantico, the height of their careers, and a timeline several decades later when the former colleagues end up back in one another’s lives by strange and mysterious circumstances. Nothing is that strange and mysterious, though, and that might be Class of ’09’s biggest problem; the show keeps the languid, contemplative pace of something like Alex Garland’s Devs but seems to have much less on its mind or up its sleeve. The entire show feels surprisingly muted, even in its most action-packed moments. An odd sense of emotional distance keeps even the show’s most surprising beats from fully working.  The series stars Kate Mara (A Teacher, House of Cards), and while the actress is as watchable as ever, there’s a blankness to her character, Poet. Her classmates are equally dull but at least have more interesting backstories. Tayo (Brian Tyree Henry, Atlanta) is underestimated by his teachers and classmates in the FBI program and wants to prove them wrong. He has grand ambitions that tie directly to his own experiences as a Black man. Hour (Sepideh Moafi, Black Bird), Poet’s Quantico roommate, has her own motivations for changing the world, and they stem from the experiences of her immigrant parents.  All of these actors have been fantastic in tons of other projects, yet here, they often take an almost toneless approach to their lines that saps the life out of most scenes. The robots of Class of ‘09 are all of the algorithmic variety. Still, for a few brief moments in early episodes, I wondered if this inexplicably boring bunch was secretly a bunch of androids. Alas, it seems as if the series is purposely going for a cool, detached demeanor, and its narrative simply doesn’t have the juice to pull it off.  Class of ’09 does fit nicely into the sleek sci-fi TV show format in other ways, though. Will Bates’ score is excellent, and the show’s direction is as striking and artistic as one would expect from an FX-related production. The cast is so talented that they’re still sometimes enjoyable to watch, even when the story and scripts don’t capitalize on their full range of abilities. A plot involving a shady, cultish figure played by Mark Pellegrino (Supernatural, Lost) temporarily gets the show’s blood pumping, and each of his scenes is genuinely tense. Yet his scenes are relatively few and far between; instead, the series is focused mainly on presenting us with a series of solemn conversations among coworkers, many of which seem frustratingly vague thanks to the non-chronological timelines.  The series also goes deep on one aspect of its ideology while refusing to illustrate another. Its central technology is pitched as a world-saving crime radar of sorts, but its invention doesn’t quell questions about bias and hatred in the criminal justice system. The show seems poised to explore those moral questions related to racial profiling in-depth, but it still approaches its central topic from a stubbornly retributive justice-based standpoint. This is a “catch the bad guys” show, and its dream of a perfect world doesn’t seem to involve criminal rehabilitation or address the social and economic factors that lead to incarceration: it’s just a skilled bad guy-catching machine. There’s something disheartening about a utopian vision of the future of the criminal justice system that still doesn’t seem to see criminals as humans, and that’s a problem the show only partly addresses.  Class of ’09 is a surprisingly hard show to describe because tonally and emotionally, it leaves audiences grasping for purchase in what might just be a blank wall. The series isn’t offensively bad, and in some ways it’s artful. Still, its strange insistence on favoring the enigmatic over the engrossing or endearing (I came away not caring about a single character) overwhelms whatever it’s trying to pull off. Skip this one and instead watch any number of other projects featuring Henry, Mara, or Moafi – or just throw on Minority Report again.  Class of ’09 is currently airing on FX.

Pink Floyd - Pink Anderson and Floyd Council Photos of Pink Anderson and Floyd Council at the Pink Floyd exhibition Their Mortal Remains at London's Victoria and Albert Museum in 2017.  Lynyrd Skynyrd Southern rockers Lynyrd Skynyrd are named after high school gym teacher Leonard Skinner who taught Ronnie Van Zant, Gary Rossington, and Bob Burns at Robert E. Lee High School in Florida in the 1960s. Skinner was reportedly notorious for enforcing the school's policy against boys having long hair, and the Lynyrd Skynyrd band name was seen as an act of rebellion against him.  Lynyrd Skynyrd - Leonard Skinner A high school yearbook photos of Leonard Skinner in 1969. He died in 2010 aged 77.  The Yardbirds The influential British band's name was partially inspired by the nickname of American jazz saxophonist Charlie 'Yardbird' Parker. It's also the name given to rail yard hobos in Jack Kerouac's 1957 novel On the Road.  The Yardbirds - Charlie 'Yardbird' Parker Jazz musician Charlie 'Yardbird' Parker in 1955 – the year of his death aged just 34.

Ramones - Paul Ramon with The Silver Beetles Paul McCartney (aka Paul Ramon) performs with The Silver Beetles in 1960. John Lennon and George Harrison were also in the group.  The Hollies The Hollies' co-founder Graham Nash revealed in a 2009 interview that they coined their band just moments before they were due to step on stage at the Oasis Club in Manchester in December 1962. The name comes from their admiration for Buddy Holly.  The Hollies - Buddy Holly Rock legend Buddy Holly in the late 1950s who inspired The Hollies band name. He died aged just 22 in the 3rd February 1959 plane crash that also claimed the lives of Ritchie Valens, ""The Big Bopper"" J. P. Richardson and their pilot Roger Peterson. It was later known as 'The Day the Music Died.'  Tesla Previously called City Kidd, the Sacramento rockers renamed themselves Tesla in homage to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla during the recording of their debut album 'Mechanical Resonance' in 1986. Some of the band's song and album titles nod towards Nikola Tesla too.  Tesla - Nikola Tesla An 1890 photo of 34-year-old inventor Nikola Tesla. He lived until he was 84 and was famously portrayed by David Bowie in the 2006 movie The Prestige.  Jethro Tull With Ian Anderson struggling to settle on a name for his band in the late 1960s (names included Navy Blue, Ian Henderson's Bag o' Nails, and Candy Coloured Rain), a member of the band's booking agent's staff christened them Jethro Tull after the 18th-century agriculturist.  Jethro Tull Jethro Tull, who helped to bring about the British Agricultural Revolution of the 18th century. He perfected a horse-drawn seed drill in 1701 that economically sowed the seeds in neat rows, and later developed a horse-drawn hoe. What a guy!  Creedence Clearwater Revival In 1967 the band toyed with renaming themselves Muddy Rabbit, Gossamer Wump, and Creedence Nuball and the Ruby, however they settled on Creedence Clearwater Revival with the 'Creedence' a nod towards guitarist Tom Fogerty's friend Credence Newball.  Crazy Horse Formerly known as The Rockets, the American band became known as Crazy Horse in 1969 when they first teamed up with Neil Young. The band was named after the 19th Century Sioux Tribe leader Crazy Horse.  Crazy Horse The Crazy Horse Memorial in the Black Hills of South Dakota. Work began on the sculpture in 1948 and it's still unfinished.  ZZ Top Billy Gibbons took direct inspiration from blues artists BB King and ZZ Hill as he liked the way the initials sounded in their stage names. He was initially going to call his band ZZ King but became concerned it sounded to similar to the original artist. Gibbons ultimately settled on ZZ Top as he remarked the ""king is at the top.""  ZZ Top - BB King and ZZ Hill Late blues icons BB King and ZZ Hill.  Greta Van Fleet The retrogressive rockers are named after a bluegrass musician called Gretna VanFleet, who hails from their home town of Frankenmuth, Michigan. Although Greta Van Fleet didn't initially ask her for permission, the 93-year-old subsequently gave them her blessing.  Molly Hatchet Just like their fellow Jacksonville rockers Lynyrd Skynyrd, Molly Hatchet were named after a real person. Molly Hatchet's moniker is more steeped in history, however, as they're named after an infamous 17th-century axe murderess dubbed 'hatchet molly'.  Kasabian Leicester indie rockers Kasabian take their name from Linda Kasabian who was a member of Charles Manson's cult, the Manson Family, in the late 1960s and 1970s. Linda Kasabian was present at both the Tate and LaBianca murders committed by the cult in 1969, but received immunity for her testimony as a key witness in the trial of Manson.

Franz Ferdinand - Archduke Franz Ferdinand A portrait of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria.  Dead Kennedys The politicised punk rockers' somewhat controversial name references the deceased members of the Kennedy family, including the assassinated President John F. Kennedy. Guitarist East Bay Ray said they weren't trying to insult the Kennedys. ""The assassinations were in much more poor taste than our band,"" he argued. ""We actually respect the Kennedy family. When JFK was assassinated, when Martin Luther King was assassinated, when RFK was assassinated, the American Dream was assassinated. Our name is actually homage to the American Dream.""

Jimmy Eat World Jimmy Eat World indirectly take their moniker from guitarist Tom Linton's brother Jim. He explained in 1999: ""My brother Jim beat up my younger brother Ed, and Jim ran into his room and locked his door, and Ed drew this picture that said 'Jimmy Eat World', and it was a picture of him eating the world. My brother Jim is kind of a big guy. A stupid name.""  The Dandy Warhols The Oregon alt-rockers' name is a play on the name of revered American pop artist Andy Warhol.  The Dandy Warhols - Andy Warhol Andy Warhol (1928-1987) was an artist and experimental filmmaker and one of the founders of the Pop Art movement.  Melvins Melvins are named after a man called Melvin who was frontman Buzz Osborne's supervisor when he worked at a supermarket in Montesano, Washington.

"assassination","2020-12-01","22:00:00","{""Cannes"", ""ProvenceAlpesCoteDAzur"", ""France""}","Wed 17 May 2023 17:01:09","CANNES FILM FESTIVAL 2023 REVIEW! The pitfalls of self-expression through political assassination are on display in writer/director Musa Alderson-Clarke’s provocative and gritty short Killing Boris Johnson. Chas (Shadrach Agozino) is falling apart over the suicide of his mother. Suffering from seasonal depression, she counted on family gatherings during the holiday to get through. However, when Prime Minister Boris Johnson declared a lockdown in December 2020 and banned all get-togethers, Chas’ mom took her own life. He’s enraged because while his mother died and he was in isolation, Johnson secretly held his own private Christmas party, violating his own rules.  So now Chas has decided to kill Boris Johnson. There is an event at a children’s school the prime minister is scheduled to appear at, and he plans to go there and shoot him. Unfortunately, Chas soon discovers that there are no gun shops in England, so he is at the mercy of whatever homemade goods are available on the black market. His sister, Maia (Jesse Akele), tries to reach out to him, but Chas won’t let her into his flat. That may be because she would see his rubber Boris Johnson mask, the one that Chas puts on at night and looks in the mirror while punching himself in the head.  The frustration of the decisions made for you gets an escapist valve through dreams of dead monarchs and legislators. Killing Boris Johnson engages in this impulse but also shows how futile it is to dare follow it. Alderson-Clarke’s script walks the same path Taxi Driver does, except the concept here walks a little further. The filmmaker first sets up the emotional reason that Johnson is targeted for slaughter. Then, by bringing it from the political to the personal, the short connects the viewer to Chas’s emotional state instead of keeping him behind glass in an insane aquarium.  “…Chas has decided to kill Boris Johnson.”  This also allows Alderson-Clarke to explore the emotional agony of loss from suicide through excellent expressionistic set pieces that comment on vengeance. One particularly vivid example is Chas attacking himself wearing his Boris Johnson mask. His fury is directed outwards but is only causing him harm. This is crystalized in the squirm-inducing climax, which is thankfully left ambiguous.  Agozino gives an outstanding performance, pulling off the challenging trick of giving us relatable alienation. He slowly boils the watcher in his craziness instead of letting loose with a full-throttle nutter. Akele provides a well-grounded counter-balance to ensure everyone isn’t heading down Derangement Lane.  The production quality is excellent and very polished. It manages a lot of grit without getting pulpy, making the intensity of the viewing experience all the more genuine. Alderson-Clarke’s got the directing skills to pay the bills while also sporting fresh storytelling talent. Killing Boris Johnson will drop jaws and land inside your mind like a bolt of clever lightning.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vZmlsbXRocmVhdC5jb20vcmV2aWV3cy9raWxsaW5nLWJvcmlzLWpvaG5zb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2021-10-12","Not Discerned","{""Gonaives"", ""Artibonite"", ""Haiti""}","Thu 18 May 2023 04:11:53","By Kirk Petersen  The recent arrest of a former top official of the Diocese of Haiti is just the latest sign of catastrophic dysfunction in the largest diocese of the Episcopal Church.  Haiti has not been led by a bishop for nearly five years, because the outgoing bishop was credibly accused of manipulating an election to install his preferred successor.  In the absence of a bishop diocesan, the ecclesiastical authority of any diocese passes to the diocesan Standing Committee. The Rev. Mardoché Vil, who heads that committee in Haiti, is a fugitive, accused by Haitian police of trafficking weapons into a country where murderous gangs are better armed than the police.  The previous president of the Standing Committee, the Rev. Fritz Désiré, was arrested May 9 on similar charges.  Still being sought for arms trafficking is Vundla Sikhumbuzo, a Zimbabwean who worked as chief of operations for the diocese from 2011 until 2018. Vundla, who has been identified in multiple news reports as an international arms trafficker, was dismissed in 2018 after he allegedly attacked his wife with acid, leaving her disfigured. However, Vundla allegedly received several deposits of US$30,000 or more from the diocese as late as 2021.  These allegations began coming to light in August 2022, when the diocesan executive secretary and an accountant working for the diocese were arrested on arms-trafficking charges.  Virtually none of this has been reported in American news media. Most of the information comes from articles on Haitian news websites, some of them machine-translated from French.  Bishop Todd Ousley of the Office of Pastoral Development is the Church Center’s liaison with the Diocese of Haiti. In an email addressed to Vil on May 7, Ousley supported plans for a diocesan synod, or convention, to elect new members of the Standing Committee.  Ousley’s expression of support was denounced as “immoral and unacceptable” by the director general of the well-respected St. Vincent’s Center, an Episcopal institution that has provided educational opportunities and job training to children with disabilities since 1945.  “In encouraging President Vil to organize the Synod, [Ousley] did not underline anything about the current context in which Father Mardoché Vil is up to now being sought and pursued by the National Police of Haiti,” wrote the Rev. Irnel Duveaux in a letter to the St. Vincent’s board, which was forwarded to TLC by a priest in the diocese. Duveaux did not respond to a request for comment.  Ousley declined to be interviewed for this article. Public Affairs Officer Amanda Skofstad released a copy of the May 7 email, which appears at the bottom of this article. ”  “The point of the letter was to address the need for a synod to elect or re-elect members of the standing committee,” Skofstad said. “Since the current occupant of the office of president of the standing committee is Vil, the letter could only be addressed to him. Any use of the letter to promote political agendas within the Diocese of Haiti would be a misuse of the letter.”  She also released the following statement from Ousley:  “To the best of our knowledge, Père Jean Mardoché Vil is the duly elected standing committee president for the Episcopal Diocese of Haiti, and the validity of his service in that office is a matter to be determined by the diocese through its synod. As always, the clergy and people of the Diocese of Haiti are being held in prayer as they face various challenges within the church and Haitian society.”  However, two senior priests in the diocese have written to the national Department of Religious Affairs to say that a rival Provisional Standing Committee was elected by the clergy of the diocese in April. The six-person ad hoc committee was created to provide “honest and credible interlocutors without criminal records, capable of ensuring a responsible transition and doing everything possible to restore the image of this institution tarnished by the actions of a group of mercenaries.”  The letter, which also appears at the bottom of this article, names Duveaux, two other priests, and three lay people as members of the ad hoc committee. The letter provides an accounting, by name, of the votes cast for and against the committee by 59 priests in the diocese, and reports that 54 percent of the priests approved the committee.  Unsafe conditions have deteriorated in Haiti since the June 2021 assassination of President Jovenal Moïse. Prime Minister Ariel Henry, who was allegedly involved in the assassination, has since served as acting president.  “Violent gangs have effectively seized control of large swathes of the country,” according to a recent United Nations report, and rival gangs have engaged in armed combat, sexual violence, and kidnapping. Vigilantes have recently begun targeting the gangs. The BBC reports that 13 suspected gang members were beaten and burned to death in Port-au-Prince, the capital, in April.  The Diocese of Haiti reports nearly 98,000 baptized members, making it more than 30 percent larger by that measure than the Diocese of Texas, which ranks second. Because of societal violence and diocesan infighting, Haiti has had virtually no influence in recent years in the governance of the broader church.  The diocese has, however, had a remarkably broad role in Haitian society. The diocese owns more than 250 schools, as well as hospitals and higher-education facilities. L’Université Episcopale d’Haïti (UNEPH) educates about 2,500 students.

"assassination","2023-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Chantilly"", ""Virginia"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 04:10:28","To support a supplemental bid to keep Jack Teixeira jailed pre-trial, prosecutors provided proof that on three instances, the young enlisted man had been caught improperly accessing classified information. Even after formal warnings on September 15 and October 27, 2022, on January 30 of this year, a female Master Sergeant observed Teixeira “viewing content that was not related to his primary duty.”  Days later, amid a discussion of “fed cars sneaking around,” Teixeira fantasized about making an “assassination van.”  Nevertheless, even after three chances to stop all this, Teixeira was still actively stealing classified information for over a month after that, and as an earlier filing laid out, he offered to take requests about “happenings that pertain to your country” after that.  TEIXEIRA: Like to thank everyone who came to the thread about the current event, going on and participated and listen to me, cover set event since it’s beginning, I was very happy and willing and enthusiastic to have covered this event for the past year and share with all of you something that not many people get to see something very few people in fact, get to see, but despite all of this, I’ve decided to stop with the updates TEIXEIRA: If you guys do you want happenings that pertain to your country or events or politics or whatever you can DM me and I can tell you what I have, but it’s going to always be a brief summary TEIXEIRA: I can’t promise, speed or prompt response, but I will respond to you eventually so offers on the table. If you want to take it until then I’ll still be sticking around here still be posting shit, so not going anywhere don’t worry about that.  I suspect the non-response to these three incidents may be one reason the Commanding Officers of this base have been temporarily suspended and the entire unit stripped of its intelligence mission.  But the more important supplement for Teixeira’s ultimate fate may be this exchange from November 15.  Teixeira: I remember reading that on a TS network … Teixeira: I work in airforce intel … User: Would have been nice User: If you alerted us that a drone was heading to crash in the middle of a suburb of our capital? Teixeira: We did Teixeira: Just not that simple User: Official government statement was nobody said shit User: And nobody saw it Teixeira: Yeah I expect that to be the official statement Teixeira: My gov would have done the same downplay strategy User: What is a ts network Teixeira: Top secret … Teixeira: Like SCI noforn, hcs … User: What is being said now about this loose ukrainian missile? Teixeira: I mean I’m hoping to get back to work in the next week rn I have covid Teixeira: When I do get back however I will let u know  This exchange may be a response to this incident from the same day, when a Ukrainian air defense missile attempting to shoot down an incoming Russian attack went astray and killed two Poles (though Przewodów is nowhere near Warsaw).  If that’s right, by extrapolation this interlocutor must be have been presenting as a Pole. After Teixeira stated that he worked in Air Force intel with access to a Top Secret network, his interlocutor elicited information, challenged Teixeira’s response, then probed how much access Teixeira really had. Teixeira responded by telling someone presenting as a citizen of a NATO ally that he had access to compartmented information and HUMINT. Then the supposed Pole asked for more information.  And Teixeira agreed to get it for him.  Perhaps this presumed Pole was just shooting the shit in a gamer chat room. Or perhaps this guy was something else, someone with the training to know how to coax someone into greater and greater compromise.  Perhaps there were others in the chat room who saw all this go down and exploited the situation accordingly.  This filing, as the earlier one also did, specifies that these chats do not reflect the full extent of Special Agent Luke Church’s knowledge of the situation.  The interactions described above do not reflect all my knowledge on this matter or all relevant, inculpatory, or violent messages that I observed. They are instead offered to provide the Court with representative sample of certain messages attributable to TEIXEIRA.  Church might well be withholding the full context of these exchanges, too, perhaps withholding what happened after Teixeira went back to work after recovering from COVID.  Thus far, DOJ’s filings speak just of the existing charges against Teixeira, 18 USC 793(b) and (d). But this willful sharing of HUMINT with foreigners soliciting it — whether they really are citizens of a NATO ally or something else — gets a closer to espionage, an 18 USC 794 violation of the sort that can carry life imprisonment.  Update: dc-turtle suggests the drone could have been in Croatia, not Poland (which I’ve added to the title). It would still amount to Teixeira sharing information with someone presenting as a citizen of a NATO ally.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVtcHR5d2hlZWwubmV0LzIwMjMvMDUvMTgvamFjay10ZWl4ZWlyYXMtcG9saXNoLW1pc3NpbGUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(Courtesy of bereaved family members of Park)  The Supreme Court of South Korea cleared a man who served 17 years in prison for allegedly spying for North Korea in 1975 of his charges in a retrial on Thursday.  Seoul's top court upheld an earlier ruling in 2022 that the evidence that originally put Park Ki-rae in jail for his breach of the National Security Act is not admissible, given that the investigative authorities during former President Park Chung-hee's military dictatorship had obtained the evidence and a confession by violating the defendant's human rights, through unlawful detention and torture.  During the military dictatorship, Seoul's anti-communist sentiment had continued to grow, particularly after the North's failed assassination attempt on the president in 1968, partly in order for the then-president to consolidate his control over South Koreans.  Defendant Park, a reunification activist, was one of the people arrested for attempting to rebuild a political party called the Unification Revolutionary Party, which the military junta had cracked down on after the revelation of party members' failed subversive activities against the then President Park in late 1960s.  Prosecutors then indicted him in 1974 for allegedly inviting others to join the party, illegally entering North Korea to communicate with North Koreans, conducting spying activities against Seoul and leaking military information.  Park was sentenced to death in April 1975. However, he ultimately served in total 17 years behind bars as his sentence was commuted several times until he was released on parole in 1991.  He continued his reunification activities after he was released from prison until he passed away in 2012.  This photo shows bereaved family members of the defendant Park Ki-rae, who was acquitted of spying charges in a Supreme Court verdict Thursday following a retrial. (Yonhap)  The defendant's bereaved family members sought a retrial of his case in 2018 in hopes of removing his criminal record, questioning the evidence's admissibility to the court. The retrial of the case began in 2020.  The prosecution, however, continued to seek life imprisonment for him, claiming that his statements to the court had been made with the help of his attorneys.  After the Supreme Court verdict, the defendant's son, Park Chang-seon, told reporters that it was ""exceptional and inappropriate for prosecutors to seek life imprisonment to a person who had endured torture and served 17 years of imprisonment unjustly,"" adding that Park was the first individual to be acquitted of spying accusations related to the Unification Revolutionary Party crackdown in a retrial.

OPCW inspectors are trained to use hazmat suits with a self-contained breathing apparatus.Credit: OPCW/Flickr (CC BY-ND 2.0)  The Hague, the Netherlands  The international body that banned chemical weapons is due to celebrate its first major milestone sometime this year — the completed destruction of the world’s declared stockpiles of banned substances. But at the organization’s brand-new facility in the Netherlands, scientists from around the world will continue its work to prevent, spot and respond to chemical warfare.  On 12 May, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) officially inaugurated its new Centre for Chemistry and Technology near The Hague, where the international body will bring together its existing laboratories and add new monitoring and training programmes.  Attacks in UK and Syria highlight growing need for chemical-forensics expertise  Although nearly all countries — except Egypt, Israel, North Korea and South Sudan — have officially renounced the use of chemical weapons under an international treaty called the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), such chemicals continue to be used illegally. The OPCW has played a central part in the response to crises: its investigators found that nerve gas and chlorine were used in the Syrian civil war during the past decade, for example, and in 2018 an OPCW team investigated the attempted assassination of a Russian dissident in the United Kingdom that involved a nerve agent called Novichok.  Historic step forward  The centre “will allow the OPCW to enhance the [lab] verification regime through maintaining and developing our knowledge, skills and expertise related to chemical weapons”, says OPCW director-general Fernando Arias.  “It was an historic step forward for the OPCW today,” said Paul Walker, a vice-chair of the board at the Arms Control Association, a non-governmental organization in Washington DC, after attending the 12 May launch. Although the OPCW’s monitoring work had been going on for more than a decade, the Syrian civil war catapulted it onto the global stage. “That began the whole process of realizing that we needed [the OPCW to have] much more expansive and expensive labs,” says Walker, who attended the inauguration on behalf of an umbrella organization called the CWC Coalition.  The new Centre for Chemistry and Technology is an upgrade compared with previous OPCW lab facilities.Credit: OPCW/Flickr (CC BY-ND 2.0)  “I think it will be a big deal for the OPCW,” says Alastair Hay, an environmental toxicologist at the University of Leeds, UK, who has been an OPCW adviser and conducts outreach training for the organization. “The previous lab facilities OPCW had were really quite limited,” he says. The lab will also enhance the organization’s ability to train researchers, he adds. The centre was built outside the OPCW’s normal budget, with €34 million (US$37 million) of voluntary contributions from 56 countries.  Stockpile disposal  Since 1997, the OPCW has had a mandate under the CWC to monitor countries’ compliance with the ban, which required signatories to stop producing chemical weapons, to declare their existing stockpiles and commit to destroying them. The organization has so far certified the destruction of more than 70,000 tonnes of chemical weapons, and it received the Nobel Peace Prize for its work in 2013. Of the eight countries that disclosed the possession of such weapons, seven have completed disposal. The eighth — the United States — expects to finish destroying its stockpile (mainly artillery containing mustard gas and nerve agents) in the next few months and is thought to be the last country to do so.  “We estimate that a large number of old and abandoned chemical weapons still remain undiscovered around the globe,” says OPCW spokesperson Elisabeth Waechter. For example, large numbers of rusting Japanese chemical weapons left over from the Second World War still await safe disposal in China. “While it is the responsibility of countries to destroy them safely, OPCW technical experts can provide advice — and verify the safe destruction.”  The CWC also compels state parties to report the production of chemicals that have a dual purpose — compounds that have legitimate uses but can also be used either as weapons or as ingredients to make them.  The OPCW analyses samples from chemical plants worldwide to search for evidence of the production of banned chemicals.Credit: OPCW/Flickr (CC BY-ND 2.0)  At the new centre, a warehouse is stocked with crates containing analytical-chemistry equipment ready to be dispatched around the world. As well as investigating alleged chemical-weapons attacks, the OPCW sends inspectors on routine missions to chemical facilities in member countries, often at short notice, to search for evidence of the production of banned chemicals. “Inspectors go to different sites and essentially audit what those particular sites have declared,” says Hay.  Samples brought back to The Hague are also sent to at least two international labs, to ensure that the results are cross-checked before they are reported to member countries. “It’s really important to be able to have access to really good facilities, where the results are incontrovertible,” Hay notes.  Novichok nerve agents banned by chemical-weapons treaty  These facilities are part of a network of 25 ‘OPCW-designated’ labs. The remit of the Centre for Chemistry and Technology includes putting labs through a periodic certification process to enable participation in the network. The centre also trains chemists from labs that want to match its standards and join the list. In an effort to provide knowledge to as many nations as possible, the OPCW is working on certifying labs in African countries for the first time: its current trainees include scientists from Algeria, Morocco, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa.  Increasing the labs’ geographical diversity can “build global capacity for the benefit of all regions and the international community as a whole”, Waechter says.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvZDQxNTg2LTAyMy0wMTYyMi050gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","0301-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Cappadocia"", ""Abruzzes"", ""Italy""}","Wed 17 May 2023 17:14:48","BY HOVSEP DAGHDIGIAN  Among the saints revered in the Armenian and other Christian churches is Surb (Saint) Hakob, also referred to as Saint Jacob of Nisibis, and Saint James of Mtsbin. This “Saint James” should not to be confused with other Saint James’s. Nisibis, also known as Mtsbin, is a city in southern Turkey near the Syrian border, about 75 km SE of Dikranagerd. Christians of Nisibis, which included many Armenians, traced their Christian origins to Saint Thaddeus who, with Saint Bartholomew, preached and were martyred in Armenia prior to Armenia becoming the first nation to accept Christianity early in the 4th century.  In the 4th century Rome and Persia were contending for power in Armenia and the region. The Persian king sent an Armenian traitor, Anak, to assassinate Armenia’s king Khosrov and his family. Members of the Armenian court, enraged by their King’s assassination, killed Anak and all his family members that they could find. Anak’s son Gregory, however, escaped to Cappadocia where he was educated within its Christian community. Similarly, the murdered Armenian King Khosrov’s son, Drtad, was sent to Rome where he received an education as befitted a future king. Rome later returned Drtad to the Armenian throne. Passing through Cappadocia, Drtad and Gregory met and returned together to Armenia. Gregory converted Drtad, and the Armenian nation, to Christianity in 301 AD, becoming “Gregory the Illuminator”, founder of the Armenian church.  Armenian cemetery at Akori / Yenidogan at 5,700 feet on Mt. Ararat Armenian cemetery at Akori / Yenidogan at 5,700 feet on Mt. Ararat, Ararat summit in background  Hakob probably was related to Gregory, either as a cousin or nephew. Some sources indicate he too may have spent some time in Cappadocia. As a youth Hakob abandoned city life, devoting himself to religion, and living an austere existence in the mountains near Nisibis. He became known for his compassion, honesty, sincerity and strong sense of justice. When the bishop of the large Christian community of Nisibis died, the church fathers tried to convince Hakob to take the position, despite his lack of refinement. Numerous attempts to convince him finally succeeded.  Bishop Hakob of Nisibis participated in numerous Christian councils attended as well by representatives of the Armenian church, such as the Council of Nicaea in 325 AD which established the Nicene Creed, to which the Syriac and Armenian church adhered, and which is a fundamental profession of faith in the Armenian church. Byzantine emperor Constantine also attended the council and developed immense respect for Bishop Hakob.  Drawing of Surb Hakob Monastery, near Akori on Mt. Ararat, from reprint of “Journey to Ararat,” Friedrich Parrot, Harper & Brothers, NY, translated by W. D. Cooley, also available online  Hakob is reported to have performed many miracles. In one instance a couple of men asked him for a donation to help bury their friend who, faking death, was lying on the ground. Hakob said a prayer, after which the men, checking their friend on the ground, discovered that he was indeed dead. They beseeched Hakob to bring their friend back to life, which he did.  While traveling through a village, Hakob encountered a group of young women washing in a stream. They immodestly refused to cover themselves properly in the presence of a stranger. In response to a prayer by Surb Hakob, the stream dried up and the women’s hair turned white. The villagers urged Hakob to allow the stream to flow again, which he did, but the immodest women’s white hair remained.  Hakob urged a Persian judge to reconsider an unfair judgement which he had issued. The judge refused. When Surb Hakob, with a prayer, turned a stone into dust the judge reversed his decision.  Yenidogan village, next to Armenian cemetery on Mt. Ararat, at or near site of destroyed Akori village  Following the death of Byzantine Emperor Constantine in 337, the Persian Sassanid King Shapur II saw an opportunity to recapture territory Persia had previously lost to Rome. He attacked Roman held territories in upper Mesopotamia, Armenia, and in 338 attacked Nisibis. Hakob mounted Nisibis’ defensive walls and, praying, caused a swarm of insects to attack the large invading army which included war machines and elephants. The insects so irritated the soldiers and elephants that they caused the army to retreat. The Persian general, eyeing the tower upon which Surb Hakob stood, claimed he saw Emperor Constantine, who had previously died, leading the defense. The Persian assault failed.  Troubled by the weakening faith of his people, Surb Hakob desired to find Noah’s “redeeming Ark”. He determined that if he could retrieve and display a piece of the Ark from Mt. Ararat[1], this would bolster his people’s faith.  One variant of Sp. Hakob’s jourrney up Mt. Ararat is described by Pavstos Buzand[2], a 5th century Armenian historian. Other accounts differ slightly:  Sign, Hakobavank / Metsaranits Monastery, 7 to 8th c, Kolotak village, Artsakh  As Surb Hakob ascended the parched slope of Mt. Ararat, he with his colleagues grew tired and in need of water. They fell to the ground and prayed. A spring then gushed forth near Hakob’s head. According to Pavstos Buzand, “the spring, called Hakob’s spring, remains to this day”. Proceeding further up Mt. Ararat, near the summit, Hakob grew tired and fell asleep. An angel descended, left a piece of wood from the Ark near his head, and indicated that Hakob must search no further. As he descended the people around Ararat rejoiced at the presence of such a holy man who brought a gift of wood from the Ark. Surb Hakob then proceeded to visit the “great servant of the Armenian king”, Prince Manachir, near Lake Van whom he had heard was a merciless and unjust man. But Hakob hoped to soften Manachir’s heart and install in him fear of God. Instead, Prince Mananchir scorned Surb Hakob, throwing 800 innocent prisoners into the sea. Hakob, with his colleagues grieving for the innocent victims, journeyed to the base of a nearby mountain. Again, he prayed and a spring came forth from the ground. Climbing to the summit of the mountain, he cursed the realm of the prince causing the death of Prince Manachir, his wife, and his seven sons. According to another source, though, one of Manachir’s sons repented and thus survived.  View of Hakobavank, Metsaranits Monastery, Kolotak village, Artsakh. Photo supplied courtesy of Hakobavank Revival Foundation View, Hakobavank, Metsariantz Monastery, Kolotak village, Artsakh  Surb Hakob Monastery, on the NE slope of Mt. Ararat, was built in 341 AD at the place where Hakob received the wood from the Ark. There may have been a church, St. James, in the nearby village of Akori[3]. The monastery was said to be of a cruciform plan with a central dome. In 1829 Baltic German explorer Friedrich Parrot, with Armenian writer Khachatur Abovian, were the first people known to summit Mt. Ararat. On the way to the summit, they visited Surb Hakob monastery which had engraved inscriptions dating to the 13th and 14th centuries. In the summer of 1840, an earthquake or volcanic explosion destroyed Surb Hakob monastery and the village of Akori. Many of the residents subsequently settled in Kamaris, a town in Kotayk province in the present Republic of Armenian. Currently the small Kurdish village of Yenidogan (“New Village”) is situated on or near the site of Akori. The monastery no longer exists, though there remain remnants of an Armenian cemetery with Armenian tombstones.  A number of Armenian churches and chapels named “Surp Hakob,” or equivalently “St. James of Nisibus” or “Saint James of Mtsbin”, exist. The history of some of these churches remains obscure.  Floor plan for Surb Hakob Monastery, Kolotak, Martakert region, Artsakh, from Հայկական Համառոտ Հանրագիտարան (Armenian Concise Encyclopedia), Yerevan, 1999. Monastery contains two churches  About a mile outside the village of Kolotak, Martakert Province, in Artsakh (Nagorno Karabagh) is Hakobavank, founded in the 5th to 7th centuries, which underwent modifications until the 12th c. In the 14th century the monastery became an important center of the region of Mets Arank, acquiring the name of Metsaranits Monastery. Between the 9th and 18th centuries the buildings were modified and maintained, with relics of Sp. Hakob kept until the 19th century. The monastery contains two churches, rooms for clergy, and in the Middle Ages was a pilgrimage site for Armenians in Eastern Armenia.  In 2022 a renovation project was initiated to restore a workable place of worship for the villagers, and refugees settling in Kolotak coming from areas of Artsakh now occupied by Azerbaijan. The monastery is also an archaeological and architectural site, with an inscription dating to 853 and medieval water pipes made of clay and wooden branches on the ground. A description of the completed Hakobavank restoration project can be seen on the reArmenia web page at https://rearmenia.com/en/collaborations/lets-restore-the-hakobavank-monastery?tab=updates .  Surb Hakob died either in 338 or 350 and is buried in the Church of Saint Jacob in Nisibis. A fragment of wood from the Ark resides in the museum at Echmiadzin. In the Armenian Apostolic Church, Surb Hakob of Nisibis’ holiday is celebrated on the Saturday between December 12 to 18.  [1] Early accounts cite the Ark as having landed on Mt. Qardu, southern Turkey, in a region called “Kordukh” in Armenian.  [2] See “The Epic Histories (Buzandaran Patmut’iwnk)” translated by Nina Garsoian, Harvard University Press, 1989 or Robert Bedrosian’s translation at https://archive.org/details/HistoryOfTheArmeniansByPawstosBuzand_569  [3] Akori was an Armenian village on the NE slope of Mt. Ararat at 5,719 feet altitude, near the border with the current Armenian Republic. The earthquake of 1840 destroyed the village and Surb Hakob monastery. In 481 AD a force of 400 Armenians routed a force of 7,000 Persians in the Battle of Akori. Akori was visited by explorers James Brice, Friedrich Parrot with Khachaur Abovian, and H.F.B. Lynch.

"assassination","2023-05-17","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 23:44:00","Gift Article Share  MR. HARRIS: Hello, and welcome to Washington Post Live. I’m Shane Harris. I’m a senior intelligence and national security reporter here at The Post, and I’m very pleased to be joined today by three of the people behind Showtime’s new spy drama airing May 19th, “Ghosts of Beirut.” I’m here with the co-creators of the show, Greg Barker and Avi Issacharoff, as well as one of the lead actresses from the series, Dina Shihabi.  Hi, everyone. Welcome. Thanks for being here.  MS. SHIHABI: Hi. Thanks for having us.  MR. BARKER: Hi.  MR. ISSACHAROFF: Hi.  MR. HARRIS: It's great to see you, and congratulations on the series, which I've been watching and really enjoying. Greg, I want to start with you. This show centers on, I guess, the ghost of Beirut, a man who many people probably are going to be unfamiliar with, Imad Mughniyeh. Tell us a bit about this individual who notably was responsible for the deaths of more Americans in terrorist attacks than anyone before 9/11. Who is he, and why is he important?  Advertisement  MR. BARKER: Well, he's one of the most fascinating characters I've ever come across. I mean, he is--he was a man who from age 19, 21, outwitted the CIA, the Mossad, and rose to incredible prominence in the Middle East as a key player in the region from nowhere. And he drove the agency and Mossad sort of, kind of crazy because they couldn't find him. They didn't even know what he looked like.  And his story plays out over two-and-a-half decades, and my view is he actually shaped the modern CIA, as we know it, from what happened in the 1980s, which then resonates in the mid-2000s. So he was complicated. He was a guy from a poor--regular family, poor neighborhood, started working as a as a bodyguard to Yasser Arafat in Beirut in the late '70s, early '80s. Kind of when the PLO left Beirut, he sort of found--I think sort of found an opening, was also recruited by Iranian intelligence, and kind of stepped into a void and used that and exploited that to his own ends and became, I think, sort of more powerful and more influential at an extremely young age than he ever imagined.  MR. HARRIS: Yeah. And it's a really--it's a very detailed portrait of how he rises into this, you know, position where he is really present for just an enormous amount of attacks that people remember from history, even if they've forgotten some of the details.  Advertisement  Avi Issacharoff, let me ask you, what was it about Imad's story that drew you to it and why you wanted to tell it visually this way?  MR. ISSACHAROFF: Well, for me, I was kind of longtime reporter, journalist, analyst for Middle East issues working for Haaretz newspaper back in 2006 when the Israeli-Lebanese war--the second war in Lebanon started. And I covered the war as a journalist, of course, and later on, I published a book that was called ""34 Days"" together with Amos Harel. And I researched Hezbollah in Lebanon, and through the research, you know, I got familiar more with a very prominent figure inside Hezbollah, who was the head of the military wing inside Hezbollah, Imad Mughniyeh.  Later on, I wrote my thesis in my master degree in Middle Eastern studies about Hezbollah and Iranian connection, and over there, again, the name of Imad Mughniyeh was mentioned over and over again. Wherever I looked, wherever I researched, Imad Mughniyeh was this kind of a figure. So it became for me a kind of, almost an obsession, a white whale or whatever you want to call it.  Advertisement  And when I understood the personal story behind his life--his wife, his kid, the brother, the brother-in-law, everything that happened with him and the CIA and the Mossad, so you understand that you're dealing with a real dramatic story. It's not only about the terrorist that is operating in the Middle East, but this is someone way, way bigger than what you would expect from someone like that: so young, so ambitious, and still someone who managed to change the face of the Middle East and the terror as we know it, the world of terror as we know it today.  MR. HARRIS: Now, Dina Shihabi, you play a CIA officer named Lena in the series who essentially is a targeter. She's someone who is trying to find Imad Mughniyeh and is really kind of a second generation of CIA officers who've been looking for him. So talk a little bit about how you prepared for that role, and what did you know, if anything, about Mughniyeh and his story before you came to the series?  MS. SHIHABI: Not much. I had met Avi a couple of years ago, and he mentioned this story to me, and I, you know, kind of dug in a little bit. But up until I got the scripts, it wasn't a story I was that familiar with, and I was quite taken by his impact and also by his human story of--you know, his downfall is really him falling in love, and I found that so moving, because it's so easy to look at these stories in a vacuum and to see someone as a monster.  Advertisement  But when you actually go back to the history, you see what was happening in Beirut at the time and the Middle East, there really is a cause-and-effect of why someone like him makes the choices that he does and becomes who he is, and, you know, there's always a hero and a villain, depending on which side of the story you're on. And I think he was a hero to many and to himself, and the CIA was the villain and vice versa. And so I just found that the story itself was actually quite fascinating, like Greg said, an incredibly fascinating person.  When I got the part--when I was offered the part, I told Greg I wanted to be connected with as many people as possible, and he really rose for the occasion and sent me every book and every contact. And there were two women, in particular, that had an immense impact on me--Hanin Ghaddar, who's a journalist, a Shia Lebanese journalist who lives in Washington, D.C.; and then a woman who's an ex-CIA targeter. And I just spoke to them at lengths and asked them, you know, uncomfortable, intimate questions that they were very generous with.  And Hanin, in particular, had an effect on me because of her anger. I think people forget when you're looking at it from a Western perspective that Arabs get affected by someone like Imad Mughniyeh as much as the West does, maybe even more. And her anger towards what's happened in Lebanon and her--how important that was for Lena to channel that anger really stayed with me for the project.  Advertisement  MR. HARRIS: Was there anything you learned from the former CIA officer that really stuck with you as you were trying to think about how to play Lena in this and how to take on the role?  MS. SHIHABI: Yeah. You know, when I first got the scripts, Lena had a--Lena, it stayed with her, had a lot of, like I said, anger, passion. She really follows her instincts. She stood up for herself a lot, and one thing that the CIA targeter told me is there's only so far you can go until you get taken off a project. If you're too obsessed, too passionate, pushing back too much, you'll get fired, or you'll get taken off of that particular mission and put somewhere else.  And so Greg and I met when I first got to Morocco and really found the middle ground of that, found the place where she had the personality, she had had that fuel, that fire, but was smart, good at her job, knew what her boundaries were. And I just--I think that her coming across as someone good at her job was very important to me and important to--as a promise to this woman.  Advertisement  MR. HARRIS: Greg, for those who are, you know, maybe too young to remember, really, some of the--just the awful attacks that occurred in the Middle East in the '80s that Imad Mughniyeh was behind, give us kind of a rundown of some of the more notorious events that he played a role in.  MR. BARKER: It's extraordinary. In fact, if you glean through history books of that era, it's like his work is throughout, even though at the time it wasn't widely known.  So there's an initial suicide bombing on an Israeli base in Tyre, soon followed by an attack, massive attack on the United States embassy in 1983 in Beirut, which killed hundreds of people and wiped out the entire CIA station at the time, including--well, I won't give away--but one of the very, very prominent CIA officers who was on the cusp of what he hoped was a Middle East peace plan, a regional peace plan; TWA bombing attack on the--TWA hijacking, attack on the marine barracks, hostage taking.  Advertisement  You think about Beirut hostage crisis mid-80s, it was all Mughniyeh, including the kidnapping of the CIA station chief, William Buckley, which is portrayed in Episode 2, which really sort of brought the agency to its knees. And the list goes on and on, Argentina, more recent attacks in Hungary on Jewish--which was in [unclear], right, Avi? And then he was a military strategist, so he was the architect of Hezbollah's military strategy. A hundred thousand small missiles, that was all Mughniyeh.  Behind the scenes, there was no--there was no image of him, no photograph of him for decades. All the agency and Mossad had were--was his passport photo from when he was probably 15 years old, because we know he went to Iran with Arafat as a young guy, so--and that was it. And that's part of our story is how do they even--not even know where he is or what does he look like.  And so it's extraordinary, and you sort of can go back and look through that whole period of history and see Mughniyeh's fingerprints all over it, including then against U.S. forces in Iraq, which is how Lena comes into the story and the--and the story--the series begins with an audacious attack on American compound in Iraq in 2007 with a bunch of guides dressed like U.S. soldiers drive into a compound and kidnap American soldiers, hoping to trade them for some Iranian diplomats. And that kicks off everything and, in fact, was what led to the final unraveling of his identity, that one incident in Iraq in 2007.  Advertisement  MR. HARRIS: Yeah. The breadth of his career, really. I mean, it's astonishing, and I mean, it's--for those of us who kind of grew up in that time too, who do remember these things, I mean, these were on the news and featuring very prominently, and they were--kind of became almost sort of a background noise, as I remember it, of these just constant attacks. And it's incredible to think about one person being behind so much of it.  Avi, let me ask you. I mean, part of the compelling part of this narrative is not just that Imad has this hand in all these brutal attacks, but that he is just--he is a ghost. I mean, he is--the ""father of smoke,"" I think is one of the terms that people gave to him. How was he able to outwit the CIA and Mossad for so long and go without being captured?  MR. ISSACHAROFF: Well, I think that if you would talk to Mossad and CIA agents or handlers, officers, you would hear more of the same, like he was the best. I mean, yeah, you had bin Laden, of course, and bin Laden was, in a very twisted way, talented in what he did. But Imad Mughniyeh was one level up, if not two levels up. He was so sophisticated and smart and clever. He was very careful about his identity. He used nicknames all the time. He switched identities. He traveled to Iran. He traveled to Central America. He traveled to Africa. He met Osama bin Laden in Khartoum, Sudan, using a fake passport, and he was very smart about, you know, the way that he managed to maneuver everyone.  Even when he got into Beirut, even when he got into his own neighborhood, people didn't know who he was, because he stayed an enigma, because he managed to keep his identity as a kind of a--as an organizational secret. No one knew who he was, really, till the later days, of course, that he became more and more strong, popular, and then a very small group knew about his identity and how does he look like.  I think that when you understand that the two agencies needed to collaborate--and they failed when they tried to pull it separately. Over and over, they failed in trying to get to him, but when they managed to collaborate and to go together into this first-ever joint assassination operation of the CIA and the Mossad, this is where the success came from, including finding out about the way that he looks, including about reaching his whereabouts, and of course, executing the assassination.  MR. HARRIS: Yeah, it really is a tremendous joint operation, and it took, you know, decades really, didn't it, to pull it off?  And that obsession really of the CIA and of, you know, Mossad to try and find him, it comes through. And, Dina, there's one scene in particular from the first episode where you are interrogating an Iranian official, trying to just extract some information out of him to help put together the puzzle. Let's watch that clip right now, actually.  [Video plays]  MR. HARRIS: It's just a great scene of the cat-and-mouse between the two of you. It's really great, and it--how do you empathize with this and her challenge of trying to find this man who she's been, you know, clearly hunting with her colleagues for so long?  MS. SHIHABI: It goes back to what I was saying about wanting to be--there's a part of her, I think, that just wants to be the best. Obviously, there's a personal--you know, she's Shia. She's Lebanese. She grew up with stories of Lebanon and what happened to it and Hezbollah from her parents. And so there's a really deep part of her that has a connection to this. But beyond that, she is great at her job, and she wants to win.  And something Greg told me about early on is that there was a sort of ruthlessness to people that have her job, that they're after something, and they're going to do whatever it takes to get it. And doing this scene, in particular, was really fun because I wanted to find the ways in which she could connect to him and charm him and make him trust her and make him feel like they had something in common, which was all manipulative.  I don't think she's genuinely having those feelings, but she knows--she knows what her power is in that situation, and she's using it. And I think the guy--you know, plus, the guy playing Asgari is a brilliant actor, and it was really just great to have that back-and-forth with him.  MR. HARRIS: Yeah. And it really is--I know in talking to CIA officers and the reporting I do, you have to build rapport with people, even with people who you might find, you know, repugnant or dangerous.  MS. SHIHABI: Yeah.  MR. HARRIS: Now, you were born in Saudi Arabia and spent part of your youth, I think, in Beirut. How did those memories and your experience in Lebanon inform how you approached the role? Were you able to draw from that in putting your performance together?  MS. SHIHABI: Oh, yeah. I think it just seeps into your body, the fact that I have a connection to the place. I know what it feels like and smells like. I know what the--what it's like to walk down the street and experience the people, and so it just was an inherent part of--it's an inherent part of me, and so it just became an inherent part of what I brought to the character, something I didn't have to work for.  There's a moment in which I'm looking towards where Lebanon would be, and that's a very real moment. I know what it feels like to be there. I love Beirut. If I could live there, I would. I think it's an incredible place.  MR. HARRIS: Yeah. And the love for Beirut and the kind of the romanticism of it does--is something that comes through in the story really effectively, I think.  Now, Avi, in terms of the narrative of this story, it's told from the perspective of, you know, the Iranians, the Lebanese, the CIA, the Mossad, and you're really moving around from all these perspectives. You know, talk a little bit about how you construct that as a storyteller and why you felt it was important to tell it from, you know, these multiple points of view.  MR. ISSACHAROFF: You know, there's a kind of a cliché in script writing that says that the better the villain, the better the movie, meaning, you know, you need to make your bad guy, the terrorist, the one that is--that has killed hundreds of people, innocent people--you need to make him more interesting than just a kind of a villain, just a kind of a simple, bad guy.  This is what we did in ""Fauda,"" Lior Raz, the other co-creator of ours and us--and me in ""Fauda,"" and this is what we tried to pull here also with Greg, trying to show the other narrative, trying to show the other side. And one of the things that really struck--struck us is not only the fact that, yes, of course, as every human being, you have kind of a more complicated character than just good and evil. But one of the things that really made us understand that we have a real drama is to understand that the process that the Mossad and the CIA went through in order to reach their obsession, in order to get to the bad guy, they were willing to do horrifying things, including things that we might call as terrorist attacks.  1985, Bir al-Abed, southern suburb of Beirut, there's a car bomb exploding at the entrance to a mosque, a Shiite mosque that is led by Sheikh Fadlallah, in an attempt that was pulled by the CIA and probably some Phalanges in order to kill Sheikh Fadlallah and Imad Mughniyeh himself. Eighty-five people--most of them were innocent--got killed in this explosion. So this is horrible to think about.  Then later on, something that we didn't get into the show, but 1995, the Mossad pulls out a horrifying operation killing the brother of Imad Mughniyeh that wasn't really involved in Hezbollah, just in order to get Imad to the funeral and then to kill him over there. And by the way, Imad didn't get to the funeral. So you understand that the price at both sides, Mossad and the CIA, are paying in what they do is that actually it's eating their moral from the inside. You lose your own morality when you go on a war against the terrorist like Imad Mughniyeh.  MR. HARRIS: Yeah. Greg--  MR. BARKER: And then for--  MR. HARRIS: Sorry.  MR. BARKER: For Dina's character and her counterpart in the Mossad, they're grappling with that history themselves, and how do we carry out this sort of joint assassination without succumbing to these horrible accidents that their agencies committed in the past? And that's kind of the driving force for the back end of the series, but the history is alive in them and the institutions there within.  MR. HARRIS: Right. And there's even that--  MS. SHIHABI: And the--  MR. HARRIS: Yeah. Sorry. I'm sorry, Dina. Please go ahead.  MS. SHIHABI: No, I was just reiterating what Greg said is that that's something we talked about a lot. You know, you--when you're working for the CIA or the Mossad, you're carrying the mistakes that have been made along--you know, it's part of your history. It's the consequence of what they all come into this moment in time with, and so I think they're--you know, Teddy and Lena are trying to do better, but I think their morality gets in question too. I don't think you get to kill someone without your soul getting destroyed in some way, no matter what.  MR. HARRIS: Yeah. And there--  MR. ISSACHAROFF: I think that's one of the--  MR. HARRIS: The car bomb you mentioned, Avi, one of the CIA officers, in fact, says to his boss, if we do this, we're going to pay a price for it. So he's warning them, isn't he?  MS. SHIHABI: Mm-hmm.  MR. BARKER: Yeah. That's right.  MR. ISSACHAROFF: You know that towards the end, that really happened in reality, according to the research that we did. You know that right before they executed the assassination, there was a kind of a gathering in the headquarters where they pulled the operation, and there was a demand from the people in charge on both sides, from all the people that were around them: After we execute the assassination, no one is going to clap his hands. No one is going to cheer up or anything like that. This is a man, and we're going to take people's life. And this is what happened in reality. People didn't clap their hands or cheer up after the assassination.  MR. HARRIS: And, Greg, talk a little bit about the research for this show. When the show opens, you point out that this is a story based on deeply--it's a fictional version of ""deeply researched""--I think is the word you use--historical events. So how did you all go about piecing this together and choosing when to insert, you know, fictional characters and then real-life characters? How did you go about that?  MR. BARKER: It was a long and very intellectually stimulating process. Avi and I and our team spent at least six months and longer researching this by talking to people directly. There's really not a book or a series of articles we could just rely on. We did our own research.  And I found that by talking to people who may have been involved and saying, look, we--it was clear they couldn't go on the record, because they're just--they couldn't say anything of substance on the record. But what I said is like, look, we're going to--we're going to fictionalize a lot of this, but we want it to be as authentic as possible, so tell me what you think happened or what might have happened. And then people like opened up, and then we got all this interesting, really amazing details, a lot of which found a way in the scripts and different perspectives. Like the CIA would say we built the bomb and we constructed it, and the Mossad was like, no, we built the bomb. So we kind of had to choose our own path through it.  MR. HARRIS: Yeah.  MR. BARKER: Choose our own truth. It was--and it was great. I mean, Showtime gave us the time to do this and to really sort of dig in deep, and then constructing it into a narrative was--you know, was challenging because there's so much information, but that's part of the fun as well. And it was--yeah, it was an extremely intellectually, sort of satisfying process.  MR. HARRIS: Yeah.  MR. ISSACHAROFF: And part of the fun was to understand that, you know, what Greg had just mentioned that, you know, Mossad is saying we did it, CIA is saying, no, we did it, and it's a kind of a competition. But even when they pulled this thing together, they had some arguments. They had some, you know, disagreements, including one of the picks of the show, which is the argument about whether to kill Qasem Soleimani, the head of Quds force in the Revolutionary Guard, Iranian Revolutionary Guards, yes or no, because he was walking together with Imad Mughniyeh, and then you come to the question of should we execute the assassination, then kill Qasem Soleimani or not? The Israelis were in favor; the Americans were completely against. And at the end of the day, the Americans--the Israelis followed the Americans, and they did not execute the assassination of both of them.  MR. BARKER: Yeah. It was really satisfying to get into--to try to unpack that intelligence relationship, which is very complicated and has--I mean, it goes all the way back to the '80s in Beirut, and to kind of get inside that was dramatically--was, you know, fun and I think very authentic and will be eye-opening to people.  MR. HARRIS: And, Greg, did you find that people were perhaps--maybe not many on the record, but were willing from the CIA and Mossad to talk about this, and how much do they officially acknowledge publicly today about the role that their services played in ultimately killing Mughniyeh?  MR. BARKER: Officially, at least as far as the CIA, nothing.  Yeah. I mean, I actually came to the story a decade ago by doing a--when I was doing a project on the hunt for bin Laden for HBO, and a number of senior people then were telling me that their true obsession was Mughniyeh and Hezbollah, which dated back to their time in Beirut in the mid-'80s, so--and it goes--I found people willing to talk about it off the record and go into--because it--the wounds, the emotional scars run very, very deep, to the highest levels.  But what was interesting is a lot of the people who were young officers on the ground in the Middle East, often in Beirut in the mid-'80s, after 9/11 are in senior management positions and are making decisions at that time informed by the searing, sort of emotional turmoil that they went through back early in their career.  So they wanted to talk. Officially, we--you know, I sort of knocked on the front door of the agency and was like, ""What can you tell us?"" and the word came back, ""Nothing.""  [Laughter]  MS. SHIHABI: So then we did our own.  MR. HARRIS: I can sympathize with that experience covering the CIA.  MR. BARKER: Yeah  MR. HARRIS: You unearthed a remarkable amount of detail, though. It's really quite extraordinary.  Din, I'll put our last question to you. What do you want people to take away from this series? So much of it is about history, but it's such a deeply emotional and, in many ways, actually quite empathetic story about Imad Mughniyeh, which is really challenging, I think. So what do you want people to walk away from with this story?  MS. SHIHABI: I mean, that's what's--that was so beautiful about the scripts to begin with was that it's a really character-based, character-driven story, and I think you get to spend time with everyone in a way that shows their humanity and also shows their flaws. And that's always going to be the best story that's told when you finish watching something and you feel empathy towards the person that you might have thought was just a monster, and you have complicated feelings towards the people that you thought were just the hero. And you leave, I think, with a more expansive view of people and who they become because of their circumstances and their choices.  And I hope it reflects back on to, you know, the viewers themselves, which we all have parts of ourselves that are--because of generational trauma, because of what we went through in our adolescence or--it's just we are complicated. We're contradictory. We're--no one is simplistic. And I think this show does a really good job in giving you that feeling by the end of it.  MR. HARRIS: And I would think as an actor too, those are really some of the most satisfying kinds of roles to play too, right?  MS. SHIHABI: Oh, yeah, absolutely. I mean, every role has that in it, and then it takes good writers like Greg, Avi, and Joëlle to really put it on the page and bring it to life. And then I just have to, you know, make sense of it all on the day. [Laughs]  MR. HARRIS: Well, you all did a great job of that, truly, in a very complex and emotional story.  So it's unfortunately all the time we have to talk about it. The series drops on May 19th, ""Ghosts of Beirut."" Thank you to Avi Issacharoff and Greg Barker, the co-creators--  MR. ISSACHAROFF: Thank you.  MR. HARRIS: --and Dina Shihabi, the actor in the role of Lena. Thank you so much for joining us to talk about it today. It was a really great conversation.  MS.

"assassination","2023-05-09","09:00:00","{""FoxChapel"", ""Pennsylvania"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 17:35:05","- Advertisement -  Culture War wages within Hernando County School District  May 9, 2023 School Board Meeting  - Advertisement -  In a somewhat unexpected appearance, the Board also heard from Fox Chapel Middle School teacher Fawn Renczkowski. Renczkowski is the wife of transgender teacher Ashlee Belle Renczkowski, who has been the center of the Fox Chapel incident. Renczkowski also serves as the Middle School Director on the executive leadership Board of the Hernando County teacher’s union. Renczkowski said she came to “speak the truth because  so few have decided the truth is worth listening to.” She went on to say that the “far-right extremists and hate groups would prefer fake news and misinformation, halftruths,  and whole lies, hyperbole in anything that promotes us being pawns in their political game.” Quoting John 8:32, in which Jesus said, “The truth will set you free,” Renczkowski said, “Here I am, doing the Lord’s work.” She went on to say:  “The truth is that many people don’t care what happened at Fox Chapel. They don’t care what she (the teacher) did or didn’t say. They only care about pushing a false narrative to further their cause. Many teachers are removed from the classroom, but none make local or national headlines, so why did she?  Because she’s different and doesn’t conform to the status quo. It’s clear in every headline why she was targeted. She found happiness in herself, and she lives her truth, and hate groups can not stand it.  They’d rather she be dead than exist in front of students, and that’s what their goal for the last year has been. To bully her and push her to a breaking point. The truth is we’ve been under attack for the last year by a local hate group that targeted her for being different.  - Advertisement -  Neither of us fits their idea of this emotionless robot of a teacher who doesn’t make connections with their students but only teaches content. So we’re a threat to them, not because of what we’ve done or said, but who we are.  The truth is we’ve been harassed online and in person, bullied, and threatened because of a false claim, because of a lie. The truth is we asked for help from some of the School Board members who are praised and put on a pedestal by these hate groups, and they ignored our pleas. They claim not to support bullying but have promoted our mistreatment, even contributing to it.  The truth is so many we have faithfully served for over a decade betrayed us and turned their backs on us because it was easier to believe the lies than using reading comprehension skills and draw conclusions on their own. They let these hateful people write the narrative and attempt to destroy lives because it was easier to play victim than to look at reality.  The truth is, she never threatened anyone. One person’s word is not fact unless backed up by the evidence, and everyone involved in the investigation said there was no threat. They said this was a mental health report and would be treated as such.  The truth is someone betrayed their badge and promise to serve and protect because it was more important to hurt someone because they’re different.  The truth is, everyone who knows her knows she’d never say or do such a thing, and we are all hurting from the character assassination carried out this last month.  The truth is students feel safe with her. They love her, and miss her, and can not wait for her to come back. They see her differences in love and respect her. They know she’d stand in harm’s way to protect them, and she has her whole career.  The truth is, the few of you who will only believe the lies will hear me tonight. And you haven’t believed for the last month when the truth was the truth was clear and evident.  You’d rather us leave and be gone to stop serving our purpose and caring for our students. But we will not stop. We will continue to fight for our students and love them despite the attacks. Because the truth is we love our students, and they need us now more than ever.  And finally, the truth is, this could happen to anyone. No one is safe in this hateful social-political climate, So please be kind, as you never know what someone is going through. And thank you to those who have supported us and seen the truth. You have held us above water as people have tried to drown us. We’re forever grateful.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oZXJuYW5kb3N1bi5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8xNy93aWZlLW9mLXN1c3BlbmRlZC10ZWFjaGVyLWFzaGxlZS1iZWxsZS1yZW5jemtvd3NraS1zcGVha3MtYWJvdXQtYWZ0ZXJtYXRoLW9mLWZjbXMtaW5jaWRlbnQv0gGCAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhlcm5hbmRvc3VuLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE3L3dpZmUtb2Ytc3VzcGVuZGVkLXRlYWNoZXItYXNobGVlLWJlbGxlLXJlbmN6a293c2tpLXNwZWFrcy1hYm91dC1hZnRlcm1hdGgtb2YtZmNtcy1pbmNpZGVudC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"assassination","2023-05-11","14:00:00","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 13:41:02","(Bloomberg) -- Pakistan’s former premier Imran Khan said the police have surrounded his house in eastern city of Lahore to potentially arrest him again, stoking concerns of a repeat of the violent clashes between his supporters and security forces last week.  A minister in Punjab province claimed Khan was sheltering dozens of people, who allegedly attacked state and military property. The ex-cricket star, who denies the allegations, was given until 2 p.m. local time, Thursday, to hand over the suspects.  This marks a further escalation in the showdown between Khan, 70, and the military that has an outsized influence on security and domestic politics. In recent days, the army has publicly condemned those who they have identified as Khan supporters for instigating last week’s attacks and vowed to try the perpetrators in military courts.  “This is the most unprecedented crackdown,” Khan told the UK’s Channel 4 in an interview posted on Thursday morning. “In 27 years of my party’s existence, we have never indulged in violent protests, now 7,500 people have been arrested in my party. All the senior leadership has been arrested.”  Khan has called for a judicial commission headed by the chief justice to probe the attacks on state and military property. He has warned the government may take the next step of banning his party since it has started calling the group a terrorist organization.  “There are no raid or arrest plans as of now. The deployment is normal and routine,” a Lahore police spokesman said by phone. Khan’s residence already had a heavy police contingent present outside for security but this was also the scene of at least two other attempts to arrest him in March.  Firebrand  The politician, known for his firebrand speeches, was dramatically arrested last Tuesday in the country’s capital Islamabad by paramilitary troops in relation to a corruption case. The Supreme Court later ordered his release calling his detention illegal and Khan’s legal team has obtained protective bail for scores of cases to prevent another arrest.  At least eight people were killed and hundreds injured in the clashes that broke out between Khan’s supporters and security forces following his arrest. The escalating political crisis takes place as Pakistan faces its worst economic distress in decades, including Asia’s fastest inflation, and is struggling to revive a $6.7 billion International Monetary Fund bailout.  Khan was ousted as premier by a no confidence vote in April last year and has since sought to return to power by pushing for early elections. His rival, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, rejected his demands and said the government will complete its term that ends in August.  To force national polls, Khan has pushed for by-elections and his party has dissolved the provincial assemblies in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where it has majorities. The government has refused to hold those polls, saying there’s inadequate funds and these provincial elections should be held at the same time as the national vote later this year.  Khan remains wildly popular with Pakistanis, with an opinion survey showing that a majority blame the current government for the economic crisis and the tough IMF reforms. His appearance at rallies often draws tens of thousands of people.  It was at one such rally in November that Khan was shot in the leg. He blamed the government and the military for orchestrating an assassination attempt, which they have strongly denied. Things came to a head earlier in May when Khan revived those allegations at a weekend gathering and on social media, prompting the military to have a very public war of words with him before his arrest last week.  Khan’s allegations stem from Pakistan’s own history where no prime minister has served a full five-year term in office. Those who lasted more than two years were either exiled or killed, including Benazir Bhutto, who was assassinated in December 2007 during a campaign stop in an attack similar to the one against Khan in November.  “They are too scared for elections because they are scared I will win,” Khan later told Al Jazeera, referring to the military and the ruling coalition. “They are doing everything to make sure I am out of the election race.”  (Recasts lead, updates throughout)  ©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJubmJsb29tYmVyZy5jYS9pbXJhbi1raGFuLXNheXMtcG9saWNlLWhhdmUtYXJyaXZlZC1mb3ItcG9zc2libGUtYXJyZXN0LTEuMTkyMTQyN9IBZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJubmJsb29tYmVyZy5jYS9pbXJhbi1raGFuLXNheXMtcG9saWNlLWhhdmUtYXJyaXZlZC1mb3ItcG9zc2libGUtYXJyZXN0LTEuMTkyMTQyNy5hbXAuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2023-05-28","Not Discerned","{""Turkey"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 11:38:20","Last week, a sex tape purporting to feature Muharrem İnce, a third-party candidate in Turkey’s presidential election, circulated online. İnce said that the tape was a deepfake—“This is not my private life, it’s slander,” he said, according to The Guardian, claiming that the footage had been ripped from an “Israeli porn site”—but he dropped out of the race regardless, citing a longer campaign of character assassination. “What I have seen in these last forty-five days, I have not seen in forty-five years,” he said. The supposed sex tape was not the only occasion on which claims of technological deception had surfaced during the campaign. Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, the main opposition candidate, accused Russia (without offering specifics) of weaponizing deepfake technology to boost Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the incumbent president. And, at a rally, Erdoğan played footage that had been manipulated to suggest close ties between Kılıçdaroğlu and the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, which the US and EU have branded a terrorist group.  According to the BBC, İnce also said that he was dropping out to avoid being blamed for splitting the anti-Erdoğan vote. At the time, pundits deemed it a live possibility that, despite İnce’s slender support, his withdrawal could put a nail in Erdoğan’s coffin after twenty years in power—with days to go until the vote, Kılıçdaroğlu was polling just one percentage point shy of the fifty-percent threshold needed to win the election outright. But the results would paint a different picture: as the official count neared completion, it was Erdoğan who sat just shy of that threshold, with Kılıçdaroğlu further back on forty-five percent of the vote. (In confidently predicting Erdoğan’s demise, many pundits, Sinan Ciddi and Steven A. Cook wrote for Foreign Policy, indulged “too much focus on polls” and “too much Twitter navel-gazing.” Sound familiar?) The election is now set for a runoff on May 28. Erdoğan is expected to prevail—despite having overseen an economic crisis, deepening political authoritarianism, and the botched response to the massive earthquake that devastated southern Turkey and neighboring Syria in February.  Among other groups, the stakes of the election have been particularly acute for Turkey’s press, which has seen its freedom to report systematically eroded under Erdoğan. While the election was mostly considered to be free, it was also in many respects unfair—not least due to Turkey’s deeply skewed media environment. After the first round, observers led by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe deemed that “continued restrictions on fundamental freedoms of assembly, association and expression hindered the participation of some opposition politicians and parties, civil society and independent media in the election process.”  As the election unfolded, I spoke with my colleague Pesha Magid, who has covered Turkey, including for CJR; in March, she profiled a reporter who had tracked the aftermath of, and political fallout from, the earthquake. We talked about the context for the vote, the threats that journalists faced in covering it, and what a victory for Erdoğan or Kılıçdaroğlu would respectively mean for press freedom. Our typed conversation has been lightly edited for clarity.    You recently wrote for CJR about Murat Bayram, a reporter in Turkey who covered the aftermath of the devastating earthquake that hit that country and Syria earlier this year. How did the upcoming election play into your—and his—reporting? And how has the earthquake aftermath affected the election—and the coverage of it—since then?  Since the earthquake, I think the election has been lurking at the back of most people who cover Turkey’s minds. The failure of the government’s earthquake response caused a backlash of anger from communities that would normally support Erdoğan’s Justice and Development Party (AKP). Many survivors were first-hand witnesses to the government’s fatal mismanagement of the emergency response, waiting days for lifesaving rescue teams to show up. Over fifty thousand people died in the earthquake. Many of those deaths could have been prevented either through a competent rescue effort or through the government enforcing building codes.  Sign up for CJR 's daily email  Murat Bayram witnessed for himself some of the anger on the streets when he was reporting on the earthquake. He spoke about people who were asking where the government and the media were. I don’t think anyone has forgotten the earthquake or the images that spread on social media of people waiting for their loved ones to be rescued from the rubble. There’s an odd symmetry with Erdoğan’s own rise to power, which followed another devastating earthquake in 1999 and a bungled response from the government of the time. One of Erdoğan’s electoral promises back then was to do better on earthquake preparedness.  The coverage of the election in Turkey has been a complicated topic as the vast majority of major news organizations have been co-opted by the government and no longer provide independent or critical reports. Much of the government-affiliated press took the line that the earthquake was an unpreventable disaster and that the government was doing the best it could. They blamed scapegoats for some of the worst failures. Election coverage has followed a similar pattern of most major channels supporting the AKP, while a slim slice of independent media has been providing more critical coverage.  Going into the election, what were the stakes for the Turkish press?  Under Erdoğan, Turkey has become one of the world’s worst jailers of journalists. Journalists are commonly beaten, harassed, or targeted with legal cases. Only a scattered few small outlets remain independent. The stakes were the freedom of the press as a whole.  Did we see any repression of the press linked directly to election coverage? And how did this affect the way in which the first round of the election was conducted?  The short answer is yes. Since May 9, at least four journalists have been found guilty of terrorism charges, while others have faced beatings and harassment during their work.  On May 10, a journalist named Muhammed Yavaş posted a critique of the Grey Wolves, a hypernationalist group, on Facebook, only to then be beaten up by a local leader of the group. In a joint statement on May 10, the monitoring organizations Human Rights Watch and Article 19 warned of the Turkish government’s history of online censorship and throttling of social media ahead of the elections; subsequently, Twitter blocked some posts inside Turkey.  There was also the worry that pro-government media may skew information in favor of the AKP. According to the journalist Amberin Zaman, writing in Al-Monitor, “In April, Erdogan got 32 hours of air time on state TV compared with 32 minutes for Kilicdaroglu.” As the election results began to come in, some expressed fears that the state-run Anadolu agency may preemptively announce an Erdoğan victory before all the results were counted. In the end, both sides claimed to be ahead, with Erdoğan telling his supporters, “Although the final results are not in yet, we are leading by far,” according to the New York Times.  What has the opposition, led by Kılıçdaroğlu, said about press freedom in the country, if anything? And how credible has that sounded?  Kılıçdaroğlu has promised a return to “democracy” and many journalists expressed hope that this would mean that press freedom would again be possible. Many media watchers seem cautiously hopeful that a Kılıçdaroğlu victory would also be the way to open the door to an independent press. “We still would have a press freedom problem if the opposition takes power,” said Kenan Şener, general secretary of the Ankara-based Journalists’ Association, in an interview with the Committee to Protect Journalists. “However, I believe it’s certain that we will be in a better spot than this.”  On the other hand, when Kılıçdaroğlu’s opposition party, the CHP, was in power in the nineties it had a checkered record when it came to freedom of the press. It was known for also jailing journalists that opposed it, although not to the same extent as Erdoğan.  How do you see the Turkish media landscape changing as a result of this election, as it now heads to a runoff?  It truly depends on the results. If the opposition wins then I anticipate that we will see an initial gleeful rush of media freedom as journalists stretch their wings for the first time in years. But it’s unclear how long that would last—as I said, the CHP does not have the best record when it comes to journalists— though it seems unlikely that the crackdown on the press would remain as stringent as it has been under Erdoğan. I am hopeful that journalists who have long been in jail on trumped-up charges might finally be released.  If Erdoğan wins, things will undoubtedly get worse. If nothing else, the closeness of this election shows that the AKP’s grip on power is fraying. That insecurity may cause it to take an even more draconian grip on power. As Barış Altıntaş, the director of Istanbul’s Media and Law Studies Association, said in the same CPJ interview: “If they [the AKP] win by a slim margin, they might lose some of their perceived legitimacy, feel cornered, and become more repressive towards free speech and media freedoms.”    Other notable stories:  ICYMI: What a national-security regulator could mean for media deals  Jon Allsop is a freelance journalist whose work has appeared in the New York Review of Books, Foreign Policy, and The Nation, among other outlets.

One of the biggest questions that have been pestering fans is what happened in Reverie while Luffy and company had their hands full in Wano. With Sabo having a meeting with Monkey D. Dragon and Ivankov, the truth behind Cobra's demise is seemingly preparing to be revealed.  Warning. If you have yet to read the latest chapter of One Piece's manga, Chapter 1083, you might want to steer clear as we'll be diving into some serious spoiler territory. There have been many rumors swirling as to what took place on Reverie for the past few years in our world, as mysteries have been surrounding how Cobra died and what role Sabo had in the assassination. In the Grand Line, most swashbucklers and denizens believe that Luffy's brother was the one responsible for the benevolent ruler's demise, but it would seem that this might not be the case as Sabo has been hinting otherwise.  (Photo: Shueisha)  What Happened To Cobra?  To begin, Monkey D. Dragon seems to hint that the general public's thoughts on the event aren't exactly the truth, ""Regardless of the truth behind it, the assassination of King Cobra has turned you into a hero in the people's eyes. From the perspective of the rebellious, anyone affiliated with the world government is an enemy. Of course, there are many wicked kings who oppress their people but there are also wise and just kings who are capable rulers. King Cobra of Alabasta was known far and wide as a noble leader, a man of great character, but new does not always spread accurately.""  Sabo then added to this thought, putting gas on the fire as to the truth behind Cobra's murder, ""Well I'm sorry to King Cobra, but this way suits me just fine. Anything that gets the flames of revolution burning."" The chapter itself then proceeds to take us back to the Reverie event, as readers are able to witness Cobra being moved to the Five Elders in a wheelchair. While the truth has yet to be revealed, it certainly seems as though Sabo wasn't the one who delivered the killing blow to Cobra.  How do you think King Cobra died? Do you see Sabo and his revolutionaries playing a major role in this final arc?

"assassination","2025-12-16","Not Discerned","{""TaipeiCity"", ""TaipeiCity"", ""Taiwan""}","Thu 18 May 2023 05:17:10","In Taiwan, the main opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), has announced that Hou You-yi is its candidate for the 2024 presidential election. The decision comes after a very public campaign for the candidacy by Terry Guo, the billionaire founder and chairman of the Foxconn electronics manufacturing group. The KMT declined to hold a vote of its membership and instead party chairman Chu Li-lun chose the party’s candidate directly.  Hou You-yi is mayor of New Taipei City (known as Taipei County until it was upgraded to city status in 2010). Before that, Hou had a long and storied career as a police officer, rising to head Taiwan’s Criminal Investigation Bureau in 2003.  He was involved in the attempt to arrest democracy activist Deng Nan-jung in 1989 at the offices of the dissident magazine Freedom Era Weekly, and several months later Deng self-immolated to protest authoritarianism in Taiwan. Hou was also placed in command of the investigation into the attempted assassination of former president Chen Shui-bian during the 2004 presidential election.  Hou’s rival is Lai Ching-te from the incumbent Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). Lai is currently vice president of Taiwan and unsuccessfully challenged President Tsai Ing-wen in a DPP presidential primary in 2019. Tsai went on to score a crushing win against the KMT in the 2020 election. However, Tsai can’t run for a third term, and Lai faced no challengers in the DPP for 2024.  Lai has a background in public health and a master’s from Harvard University. He began his political career as a legislator in the 1990s before serving as a very popular mayor of Tainan, a DPP stronghold, in the 2010s. He joined the Tsai government as premier in 2017.  The third candidate in the election is the former mayor of Taipei, Ko Wen-je. Ko has a celebrated medical background in critical and emergency care and transplant surgery. He was first elected mayor in 2014, against the KMT and other independents, and re-elected in 2018.  In 2019, Ko founded his own political party, the Taiwan People’s Party (TPP), which shares its name but not its politics with the party founded in 1927 by Chiang Wei-shui, Cai Pei-huo and other leading figures of the time. In a very divisive political landscape, the TPP aims to occupy the centre ground with an emphasis on non-partisan governance, but Ko is also known for his public gaffes and political naivety.  Polling has Hou and Lai in a close race with around 30% support each, with Lai generally a few points ahead. Ko sits in third at around 20%. These numbers are hardly predictive this far out from the vote in January, but with each party having chosen its candidate, onlookers can expect a very different presidential campaign and a shift in tone in Taiwan’s politics.  As the DPP candidate, Lai has emphasised continuity with Tsai, but he is still a very different style of politician. Tsai casts herself as disciplined, resolute and technocratic, even somewhat above the fray. Lai, although he couldn’t be called a populist, has built a more hands-on career through local politics in the south.  The KMT’s Hou offers his no-nonsense and pragmatic style to a party that wrestles with its authoritarian legacy and its close links with Taiwan’s business interests. Although Hou and Lai are stridently critical of each other, they occupy some of the same space as political personas.  Ko, for his part, will take votes away from both major parties but may prove more damaging for the KMT in its traditional stronghold of Taipei.  As candidates, both Hou and Lai have given voice to issues in Taiwanese politics that are too often subsumed by cross-strait relations, especially the north–south divide and gender and class politics. But neither candidate has a straightforward story to tell on those issues yet, and that could make for a bruising campaign.  Across the strait, Beijing would be deeply unhappy with Lai as president, seeing him as more explicitly Taiwanese nationalist than Tsai, however careful he might be in the campaign. Hou has stayed in line with the KMT’s position. He has already ruled out Beijing’s formula of ‘one country, two systems’ for unification and doesn’t represent the factions of the KMT for whom Chinese identity is central to their politics.  Whether it be Lai Ching-te or Hou You-yi, understanding the next president of Taiwan will require some work from an international community that has grown comfortable with and sympathetic to Tsai. Her progressive politics are accessible and familiar to interested international observers.  Hou and Lai, however, practise a politics steeped in community life and the social divides of Taiwan. While they are each compelling, the world will require deeper familiarity with the Taiwanese story to fully understand them as politicians.  As Beijing continues its threatening military activity around Taiwan, developing that familiarity will be a good starting point for policymakers around the world as they prepare for the 2024 election outcome.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFzcGlzdHJhdGVnaXN0Lm9yZy5hdS9nZXQtcmVhZHktdG8tbWVldC10aGUtbmV4dC1wcmVzaWRlbnQtb2YtdGFpd2FuL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2023-05-02","Not Discerned","{""Gaza"", ""Gaza"", ""GazaStrip""}","Wed 17 May 2023 22:19:00","War is hell, as William Tecumseh Sherman proved on his March through Georgia a century and a half ago. This is especially true if you are a soldier or a civilian who gets in the way – but it is not true for everyone.  Not for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, at least not this time.  When Palestinian Islamic Jihad began firing rockets to avenge the May 2 death of one of their own, resulting from his 86-day hunger strike, Netanyahu’s ultra-hawkish coalition partners demanded a brutal response. They would have preferred carpet bombing Gaza with B-52s but appeared to be mollified by a highly focused assassination campaign that killed six top PIJ leaders.  The risk-averse Israeli prime minister went to war with PIJ and emerged victorious on all fronts. He got to burnish his “Mr. Security” credentials without a major land war and – at least for the time being – saved his coalition and stopped the plunge in his polling numbers.  By firing more than 1,400 rockets and mortars across the southern half of Israel – even targeting Tel Aviv – PIJ gave Netanyahu a temporary respite from the massive public demonstrations against his attempted overthrow of the nation’s independent judiciary. Only tens of thousands of protesters, instead of the usual hundreds of thousands, turned out last weekend.  The Iron Dome air defense missile systems is seen during operational trials conducted following the conclusion Operation Shield and Arrow on May 14, 2023 (credit: DEFENSE MINISTRY)  This latest conflict may also have dealt a body blow to the Israeli far Right’s judicial coup. Former senior Mossad official Yossi Alpha pointed out that “the fight against PIJ was led by the very IAF pilots and IDF Unit 8200 cyber experts who have spearheaded the public protest and been labeled by the far Right as ‘traitors.’”  “The fight against PIJ was led by the very IAF pilots and IDF Unit 8200 cyber experts who have spearheaded the public protest and been labeled by the far Right as ‘traitors.’” Yossi Alpha  With the international media focused on the spectacular footage of Israel’s anti-missile systems intercepting rockets fired from Gaza, Finland expressed an interest in these defensive weapons.  Finland joins Singapore, Canada, South Korea, India, Slovakia and the Czech Republic in wishing to acquire the life-saving Iron Dome and David’s Sling. Israel’s new friends in the Gulf are also interested, as they face threats from Iran.  The US helped finance their development, and US defense contractor Raytheon partnered with the Israeli developer, Rafael, to build the systems.  War is good for business and for Netanyahu  War is good for business. Just look at the defense plants across the US and Western Europe working overtime to keep the Russian bear from restoring its old empire.  There is, however, a country that wants and needs Israel’s advanced missile defense, but is off limits – Ukraine – because Bibi doesn’t want to anger Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. Nevertheless, Israel and Ukraine have a common enemy, Iran, which provides most of PIJ’s missiles aimed at Israel, and Russia’s drones targeting Ukraine.  The IDF reported that Iron Dome intercepted 95% of PIJ rockets targeting populated areas. Hundreds more landed in open fields. An estimated 290 PIJ rockets launched toward Israel landed in Gaza, killing at least four Palestinians, including children.  PIJ rockets killed an 82-year-old Jewish Israeli woman in Rehovot and wounded five people. Another PIJ rocket killed a Palestinian man from Gaza working legally in Israel on Moshav Shokeda, while his brother and a Bedouin Israeli were wounded in the strike, i24 News reported.  Many of Israel’s critics point to the disproportionate casualty rate on the two sides. Not enough dead Jews, apparently. Health officials in Gaza said 33 people were killed in the latest round, including 18 terrorists and six children. At least four uninvolved Gazans were killed in failed rocket launches, Times of Israel reported.  PIJ, it turns out, killed more Gaza civilians than it did Israelis, and it wasn’t for lack of trying. PIJ, like Hamas, fires its rockets, missiles and mortars indiscriminately toward populated areas in Israel for the undeniable purpose of creating terror and death. PIJ and Hamas are both US State Department-designated Foreign Terror Organizations and the EU terror organizations list. Hamas dominates Gaza but decided to sit out this round of fighting.  The Israeli Air Force insists its aim is precise and targeted only terrorists, to avoid civilian casualties – but terrorist leadership headquarters and many launch sites are intentionally located in populated urban areas.  There’s a brief respite in the latest round of war – thanks once again to an Egyptian-negotiated ceasefire – while Iran rearms its proxies (and arms Russia as well). PIJ brags about the damage it inflicted on Israel, and vows new revenge for the six martyred leaders lost to the hated Zionists. Meanwhile, Rafael and Raytheon are taking orders for Iron Domes and David’s Slings. And Netanyahu has appeased his uber-hawks.  And just as sure as God made little green apples, there will be another round of killing because the leaders on both sides seem to know of no other way to settle their differences.  If there is one thing today’s Israeli and Palestinian leaders appear to have in common, it is a lack of interest in finding a political solution.  There will be more Shield and Arrow-type operations, each a bit longer and more lethal until there is new leadership that does not see peaceful coexistence as an existential threat.  Until then, you can dust off that old Vietnam-era poster with the slogan, “War is not healthy for children and other living things” and add: “except for politicians’ poll numbers and arms makers’ order books.”  The writer is a Washington-based journalist, consultant and lobbyist, and the former American Israel Public Affairs Committee legislative director.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpwb3N0LmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGUtNzQzMzY10gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Information obtained by Iran International shows how Naji Sharifi-Zindashti and his cartel now dominate the narcotics trade thanks to the support of the government militia.  His extraordinary rise comes despite his having killed a prison guard in Iran and fleeing abroad, only to return with impunity.  Investigative reporter Mojtaba Pourmohsen has uncovered how a recent rise in the number of executions of convicts sentenced to death on drug-related charges is the result of infighting between rival drug cartels with connections within the ranks of the IRGC.  Naji Sharifi-Zindashti  Emerging triumphant from this criminal war, Sharifi-Zindashti and his accomplices – dubbed “The Friends’ Club” – have used the IRGC’s vast reach and control over transit routes and logistics to gain the upper hand in Iran's drug market, according to sources.  The Club comprises senior IRGC officials and high-ranking members of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council as well as managers from Tehran Municipality and members of parliament.  Sharifi-Zindashti not only pays bribes but also supplies opium and heroin for the personal consumption of many of these senior officials.  According to the sources, Sharifi-Zindashti’s gangs traffic more than 20 percent of drugs distributed across Iran and about 35 percent of the drugs pushed in the capital Tehran.  The narcotics that are confiscated and destroyed as part of the Islamic Republic’s regular war on drugs mostly belong to rival gangs.  Iranian police arrested Zindashti in 1996 for a drug deal. Sentenced to death on drug-related charges, Zindashti along with an accomplice killed a guard during transfer to the court to testify in another case. Zindashti fled to Turkey, where he established a drug and human trafficking cartel.  Zindashti's villa in Istanbul with expensive cars and personalized license plates  He has since been cooperating with the Islamic Republic’s intelligence agencies in numerous cases, including the abduction in 2020 of Swedish-Iranian Habib Chaab (Asyud), a political activist and former leader of the Arab Struggle Movement for the Liberation of Ahwaz (ASMLA) who was executed earlier in the month.  In December 2020, the Turkish Police arrested 13 members of the Zindashti Cartel on charges of collaboration with Iranian intelligence. According to Turkey's official government news agency, Anatoli, the Iranian Intelligence Ministry had been using the gang to assassinate or abduct Iranian dissidents in Turkey at least since 2015.  Zindashti is also suspected to have been behind the assassination of Iranian dissident Masoud Molavi Vardanjani in Istanbul in November 2019. Molavi-Vardanjani, a former Iranian intelligence operative and a civil engineer by education, fled to Turkey in 2018 and launched a Telegram channel, called Black Box, focused on corruption allegations against Iran’s extraterritorial Qods Force, top officials in the office of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, judges and other senior figures.  In 2018 some of the members of the group and Zindashti himself were arrested in Turkey on suspicion of assassinating Saeed Karimian, the founder and head of Gem TV, and other killings related to drug trafficking. They were eventually freed, reportedly as a result of lobbying, bribery and lack of adequate evidence.  After his release Zindashti returned to Iran and despite his convictions for drug trafficking and the killing of a prison guard in the past, Zindashti leads a free life in Iran. In December 2022, he was honored during a ceremony by Iran’s Education Ministry as one of the members of the Charity for School Constructions. He is a benefactor and CEO of Zindashti Star Charitable Institute, constructing shopping malls and schools, yet also a drug lord with links to regime insiders.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiKGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlyYW5pbnRsLmNvbS9lbi8yMDIzMDUxNzE4MzjSAShodHRwczovL3d3dy5pcmFuaW50bC5jb20vZW4vMjAyMzA1MTcxODM4?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

He’s done with one. But not the other.  “The franchise is not done. I’m done,” Schwarzenegger tells THR when speaking about the long-running Terminator franchise that he recently returned to for 2019’s Dark Fate.  The actor continues, “I got the message loud and clear that the world wants to move on with a different theme when it comes to The Terminator. Someone has to come up with a great idea. The Terminator was largely responsible for my success, so I always would look at it very fondly. The first three movies were great. Number four [Salvation] I was not in because I was governor. Then five [Genisys] and six [Dark Fate] didn’t close the deal as far as I’m concerned. We knew that ahead of time because they were just not well written.”  In regards to Conan, Schwarzenegger is a whole lot more hopeful.  He tells THR, “It’s been pending for the last 10 years. [Fredrik] Malmberg owns the rights. He comes to me and says, ‘Oh, I have a deal with Netflix,’ and when we ask Netflix, they don’t know anything about it. It’s one of those crazy things. I hope he figures it out.  “I think you do it like Unforgiven, where you play the age. There’s a great script out there that John Milius wrote, and others have written one. The story is there. There are directors who want to do it. But [Malmberg] has the rights, and until he sells the rights for one or two movies, or for the franchise, there’s nothing you can do about it.”  Schwarzenegger of course played Conan in the 1980s feature films Conan the Barbarian and Conan the Destroyer, and he has been vocal about trying to get a new Conan movie off the ground for a while now. At one point in time, The Legend of Conan was intended to be a direct sequel to the 1982 movie, with Schwarzenegger returning as an older Conan.  Will it ever happen? Stay tuned for more as we hear it.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL2Jsb29keS1kaXNndXN0aW5nLmNvbS9tb3ZpZS8zNzYyNjA5L2hvcnJvcnNjb3BlLXNjcmVlbi1nZW1zLWFkYXB0YXRpb24tb2YtMTk5MHMtaG9ycm9yLWJvb2std2lsbC1yZWxlYXNlLWluLXN1bW1lci0yMDI0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Republican president Abraham Lincoln, who served from 1861 until his assassination in 1865, is considered the most effective United States president, according to a C-Span poll that surveyed 91 presidential historians.  Lincoln’s performance was highest in the category of overall performance in the context of his time, with a score of 96.5/100. He was also rated highly for his crisis leadership, scoring 95.4/100. However, he did less well for his relations with Congress, managing only 78.9/100.  The historians praised his public persuasion abilities, which helped him rally support for his policies. However, they criticized his administrative skills, citing his lack of experience in government.  Lincoln’s greatest achievements were presiding over a divided nation through most of the Civil War, which ended with the country united again, and shepherding through Congress the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed the slaves.

"assassination","2021-07-01","Not Discerned","{""PortAuPrince"", ""Ouest"", ""Haiti""}","Wed 17 May 2023 17:28:37","UN official warns violence shows ‘no sign of ending’ as frustrated Haitians go after gang members themselves.  Haitians are “taking the law into their own hands” with a wave of vigilantism that risks worsening the country’s already skyrocketing levels of violence, a United Nations official has warned.  Ravina Shamdasani, a spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said that suspected Haitian gang members have been killed and lynched in the streets amid the recent rise of “vigilante justice”.  “We’re seeing a cycle of violence that’s showing no sign of ending,” Shamdasani said in an interview with Al Jazeera this week. “It’s incredibly worrying.”  “People are living in a nightmarish scenario and there’s very little hope, so they’re taking the law into their own hands, which of course is not going to help long term.”  Shamdasani added that nearly 1,500 gang-related killings were reported between January 1 and the end of April, with 49 more taking place between May 10 and 15 alone. “This is a situation that’s akin to an armed conflict situation,” she said.      Widespread gang violence has plagued Haiti for nearly two years, as armed groups vie for control after the July 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moise, which created a power vacuum.  Haiti’s de facto leader, Prime Minister Ariel Henry, whom Moise chose for the post just days before he was killed, has faced a crisis of legitimacy — and attempts to chart a political transition for Haiti have failed as well.  The violence has impeded access to healthcare facilities, forced the closure of schools and clinics, and worsened already dire food insecurity by cutting residents of gang-controlled areas off from critical supplies.  The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) warned this month that more than 115,600 Haitian children in 2023 were expected to suffer from “severe acute malnutrition”, also known as “severe wasting”, as a result of the instability.  Police under-equipped  The Haitian National Police have pledged to combat the gangs, saying in a statement posted to Facebook on Tuesday that the force “does not intend to give up and renews its pledge to continue to protect lives and property of the population”.  But observers have said the Haitian police are ill-equipped and understaffed and cannot adequately respond to the crisis.  “The Haitian police is not managing the situation well,” the UN’s Shamdasani said. “They cannot manage this on their own, and the people realise this, which is why they’re taking the law into their own hands.”  In recent weeks, a vigilante movement called Bwa Kale — “peeled wood” in Haitian Creole — has emerged, with Haitians arming themselves with sticks, machetes and other weapons to go after the gangs.  In late April, residents in the capital Port-au-Prince lynched suspected gang members and set their bodies on fire. Images shared online and by news agencies showed a crowd of people standing near a pile of burned human remains in a street.  The Bwa Kale movement is “a vaccination campaign against gang violence”, Jean Baptist Kenley, a social leader in the Port-au-Prince area of Solino, recently told Al Jazeera. “The Bwa Kale will continue to eradicate the kidnapping violence in the country.”  ‘Short-term solution’  Garry Pierre-Pierre, a Haitian-American journalist and founder of The Haitian Times, recently told NPR that the Haitian population has also “enlisted the police” to help in efforts to stop gang violence.  In some cases, Pierre-Pierre explained, community members will identify gang members and take law enforcement officers directly to them to make arrests.  “It’s not totally the population taking things into their own hands,” Pierre-Pierre said. “It’s not totally like vigilante[s]. It’s working hand-in-glove with the police … to give the police now the upper hand as they fight these gangs.”  Vigilantism “is not the answer” to Haiti’s problems, Pierre-Pierre also wrote recently.  “It is a short-term solution the police must take a hold of immediately, to seize the advantage it affords to rid Port-au-Prince of this menace that has brought the capital city, and by extension the country, to its knees over the last two years,” he said.  “The police can continue their operations alongside the people to credibly identify alleged gang members. These suspects should be treated as innocent until proven guilty, facing the fullest extent of the law — as feeble as Haiti’s justice system may be right now.”  Meanwhile, the UN continues to urge the international community to launch a multilateral mission to help Haiti respond to the violence.  UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who discussed the situation in Haiti during a meeting with Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness in Kingston this week, said the crisis requires “a much stronger commitment by the international community”.

Instead, they have urged foreign nations to provide more support to the Haitian police, stem the flow of weapons to Haiti — particularly those coming from the United States — and sanction officials and others profiting off the violence.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLzUvMTcvaGFpdGktc2Vlcy1yaXNlLW9mLXZpZ2lsYW50ZS1qdXN0aWNlLWFzLWdhbmctdmlvbGVuY2Utc29hcnPSAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbGphemVlcmEuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzLzIwMjMvNS8xNy9oYWl0aS1zZWVzLXJpc2Utb2YtdmlnaWxhbnRlLWp1c3RpY2UtYXMtZ2FuZy12aW9sZW5jZS1zb2Fycw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2023-03-01","Not Discerned","{""Baku"", ""Baki"", ""Azerbaijan""}","Wed 17 May 2023 12:08:50","Welcome back to The Farda Briefing, an RFE/RL newsletter that tracks the key issues in Iran and explains why they matter. To subscribe, click here.  I'm RFE/RL correspondent Golnaz Esfandiari. Here's what I've been following during the past week and what I'm watching for in the days ahead.  The Big Issue  Dozens of independent Iranian lawyers were imprisoned during the monthslong antiestablishment protests that erupted last September. Most had represented jailed protesters or been critical of the authorities on social media.  Many of the lawyers were later freed under an amnesty announced by Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in February.  But in recent days, around 20 lawyers across the country have been summoned. It was not clear if they were facing new charges or had been called in for questioning.  ""The amnesty gave me hope but these actions that are taking place are frustrating,"" lawyer Ali Mojtahedzadeh said on Twitter on May 11, adding that he did not know why he had been summoned.  ""The lawyers who have been summoned are lawyers who were [defending protesters] or those who have been active on social media,"" said Mojtahedzadeh.  Mitra Izadifard, a lawyer from the northeastern city of Mashhad, told the reformist daily Etemad that she and several other lawyers had been called in to appear before a court in Tehran on May 22. Izadifard said she was summoned due to some of her ""tweets and previous legal activities.""  Why It Matters: The authorities appear to be renewing pressure on independent lawyers who have taken on sensitive political cases or criticized the clerical establishment.  Independent lawyers have been under systematic pressure and harassment for decades in the Islamic republic. Many have been forced into exile or ended up in jail, including prominent human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh.  What's Next: It is unclear if the authorities are trying to intimidate or imprison again those lawyers who have continued to criticize the clerical regime since their release.  Since the antiestablishment protests subsided, lawyers have been vocal in their criticism of the authorities, including their new attempts to enforce the hijab law.  Several lawyers, including Mohsen Borhani, have said publicly that the measures are a violation of the Islamic republic's laws.  Stories You Might Have Missed  Nearly eight months ago, 21-year-old Erfan Rezai was killed during Iran's brutal crackdown on protests. Despite threats and pressure, his mother has waged a social media campaign to demand justice. In an interview, Farzaneh Barzekar said she holds little hope that real justice will be served.  Afghan migrants in Iran are finding it difficult to carry out the most routine transactions because they cannot obtain the bank cards they need to access mobile phone services, metro tickets, and even their daily bread. They say the restrictions, which affect long-term immigrants and undocumented arrivals alike, are making life increasingly difficult.  What We're Watching  Azerbaijan said on May 16 that it arrested at least seven men who were allegedly recruited by Iran to destabilize the Caucasus nation.  In a statement, Baku said the men were plotting a ""violent overthrow of the government and the assassinations of prominent personalities and senior officials.""  The arrests were the latest in a series of detentions of people the Azerbaijani government says were working for Iran.  Why It Matters: Relations between the two neighbors have become increasingly strained in recent months, particularly since an attack on the Azerbaijani Embassy in Tehran.  In January, a lone gunman stormed the embassy, killing one person. Azerbaijan blamed Tehran for the incident, which it described as a terrorist attack. The Iranian Foreign Ministry said the gunman had personal motives.  Tensions were further heightened in March following a failed assassination attempt in Baku on a parliamentarian in Azerbaijan who has been critical of Iran.  Last month, Azerbaijan expelled four Iranian diplomats in Baku. In response, Iran expelled the Azerbaijani ambassador in Tehran.  Baku has accused Iran of backing Armenia in a long-standing conflict over Azerbaijan's breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh region. Iran has long blamed Azerbaijan for fueling separatist sentiments among its sizeable ethnic Azeri minority. Tehran has also been critical of Baku's deepening relations with Israel, Iran's archenemy.

The citation for the award reads: “A brave and uncompromising pulse-taking of the current crisis in Indian politics, focusing on the 2017 political assassination of trailblazing Bengaluru journalist Gauri Lankesh. A “J’accuse” docu-thriller directed and narrated with verve by Gauri’s sister, Kavitha Lankesh”.

Last year, Gauri won the “Best Human Rights Film” award at the Toronto Women’s Film Festival.  In a March 2022 interview with The Federal, Lankesh spoke about why she decided to make the film. “To make a film on Gauri is a really tough decision because she was more than a sister to me. She was my friend, mentor, conscience keeper. I am still struggling to come to terms with her exit from this mortal world.”  “But I decided to do the film just because she is a model to thousands of women and journalists in this country … The world knew more about her only after her assassination,” the poet-filmmaker said.  Gauri Lankesh was shot dead at her Bengaluru residence in 2017 by a man who said he was following orders to kill Lankesh with the purpose of “saving his religion“. At the time of her death, Lankesh’s weekly magazine had come under attack for her views against the communal politics of the Sangh parivar in Karnataka.  The film was commissioned by the Netherlands-based press freedom organisation Free Press Unlimited, which says on its website that its mission is to support “local media professionals and journalists, particularly in countries with limited (press) freedom” and enable them to give people access to information through which “they can monitor their governments.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vbS50aGV3aXJlLmluL2FydGljbGUvZmlsbS9rYXZpdGhhLWxhbmtlc2gtZ2F1cmktZG9jdW1lbnRhcnktZmlsbS1hd2FyZC1tb250cmVhbD9taWRfcmVsYXRlZF9uZXfSAVtodHRwczovL20udGhld2lyZS5pbi9hcnRpY2xlL2ZpbG0va2F2aXRoYS1sYW5rZXNoLWdhdXJpLWRvY3VtZW50YXJ5LWZpbG0tYXdhcmQtbW9udHJlYWwvYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","1963-11-22","Not Discerned","{""Dallas"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 02:27:00","Alleged Pentagon documents leaker Jack Teixeira was warned twice to stop taking notes on classified information — and bragged about breaking the rules to his friends, prosecutors said.  In court papers filed Wednesday, Justice Department lawyers claimed the Massachusetts Air National Guardsman jotted down top-secret information during confidential meetings that he would then spread across a social media channel dedicated to video games and guns.  “It is clear that the dissemination of the classified national defense information that the Defendant unlawfully posted was even more widespread and diverse than previously known,” the documents state.  “It is also clear that the Defendant publicly exalted in the breadth and sensitivity of the information that he was disclosing … The Defendant boasted about the wide swath of classified information he had access to by virtue of his position.”  Teixeira, who worked as a cyber transport systems specialist, was arrested last month and charged under the Espionage Act with unauthorized retention and transmission of classified national defense information for allegedly sharing hundreds of highly classified Pentagon documents concerning national security and the war in Ukraine on the gaming platform Discord over the course of several months.  According to the Wednesday filing, one of the social media platforms servers had at least 150 users — including overseas individuals — at the time Teixeira allegedly shared confidential information, though prosecutors believe “many more” users have since flocked to the channel since his arrest.  Jack Teixeira was allegedly warned twice to stop taking notes on top-secret information. via REUTERS  In one chat, the 21-year-old told his friends that he would post “a f–ck ton of information” about US intelligence in Israel, Palestine, Syria, Iran, China and more, the filing shows.  “Idgaf what they say I can or can’t share … [a]ll of the s–t I’ve told you guys I’m not supposed to,” he allegedly told other users, implying he understood the unlawfulness of his disclosures.  Teixeira was admonished by his superiors in September 2022 for reportedly scribbling down notes during a confidential meeting and slipping the piece of paper into his pocket.  Teixeira is charged with unauthorized retention and transmission of classified national defense information. AP  He was given a cease-and-desist order preventing him from conducting “any deep dives into classified  intelligence information,” but Teixeira was caught taking notes a second time just one month later.  In February 2023, Teixeira was again observed “viewing content that was not related to his duties,” prosecutors said.  The federal filing also claimed that Teixeira’s secret history as a potentially violent person proves that he was acting maliciously when he allegedly shared secret information on Discord.  Teixeira was arrested April 13 by heavily armed federal agents clad in armor at his mother’s home in North Dighton, Mass. New York Post  Prosecutors pointed to a video published by the Washington Post of Teixeira using racial and ethnic slurs while “emptying the magazine of bullets” at a target.  He also allegedly said online that he wanted to murder a “ton of people” in the name of “culling the weak-minded” and talked about rigging an “assassination van.”  “There is every indication that the Defendant is skilled and experienced at hiding these unsavory aspects of his character,” the filing states.  Teixeira, who has not yet entered a plea, claimed he never intended for any of the information he shared to be “widely disseminated.”  A ruling on Teixeira’s pre-trial detention is expected Friday.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE3L3BlbnRhZ29uLWxlYWtlci1qYWNrLXRlaXhlcmlhLWJyYWdnZWQtb24tZGlzY29yZC1hYm91dC1icmVha2luZy1ydWxlcy1kb2NzL9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE3L3BlbnRhZ29uLWxlYWtlci1qYWNrLXRlaXhlcmlhLWJyYWdnZWQtb24tZGlzY29yZC1hYm91dC1icmVha2luZy1ydWxlcy1kb2NzL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Eighty-eight-year-old Nebraskan Beverly Deepe Keever knows that war better than most Americans. She was America’s longest-serving Vietnam War correspondent.  Born in Hebron, Nebraska, Beverly Deepe Keever earned her journalism degree from University of Nebraska and a master’s from New York’s Columbia University. At age 26, she bought a one-way ticket to Asia to teach English and sell freelance stories to the Associated Press.  “I went into journalism because I wanted to understand people and culture in other countries,” Deepe Keever said.  Author, journalist and scholar Brooke Kroeger said Deepe Keever had something special as a reporter.  ""This is someone who's got a halo, you know,” he said. “There's something really marvelous about her in her sense of herself, even coming from a small Nebraska town.”  A year after arriving in Asia, Deepe Keever came to Saigon as fighting began heating up between South Vietnamese troops and Viet Cong guerrillas backed by Communist North Vietnam. The U.S. government sent 500 military advisors to help South Vietnam, and more U.S. troops began pouring in. In 1962, Deepe Keever sent a letter to her friend in Nebraska describing her experience.  “I am undergoing a shock treatment here,” she wrote. “All those professional and personal ideals which had never been shattered until I reached here seem to be under constant bombardment. The things that happen in the country would be a bombshell to the American public.”  Friends and family read Deepe Keever’s newspaper reports about all the fighting in Vietnam from 8,600 miles away.  “Paul would call up Dad,” she said. “’Get that girl out of there.

From playing a woman, a dwarf, and an elderly man to ten roles in one film, he has done it all. Apart from his different avatars in films, Kamal Haasan is also known to make movies on social issues that are often deemed sensitive. This has caused trouble for many of his films, with calls for a ban on them. Here, we are listing some of Kamal Haasan’s most controversial films that created a lot of buzz.  Vishwaroopam  Vishwaroopam was dogged by numerous controversies. Due to concerns over communal violence, the movie was banned in Tamil Nadu. The film, according to the Tamil Nadu Muslim Munnetra Kazhagam, indicated that all Muslims were terrorists. Later, the High Court removed the ban. Tamil Nadu theatre owners challenged Kamal Haasan’s decision to show the movie via satellite. A week after its first theatrical run, the movie was made available via DTH.  Dasavatharam  This movie was famous for Kamal Haasan enacting 10 different roles, something never attempted before in Indian cinema. However, during the early portion of the film which was set during the Chola empire, certain scenes depicted the clash and hostility between followers of Vaishnavism and Shaivism, which resulted in protests.

A joint statement issued by the Ministry of Interior, the State Security Service, and the Prosecutor General's Office on May 16 revealed that the suspects ""were working for Iranian secret services.""  They are accused of seeking to ""disrupt stability"" in the South Caucasus country by disseminating ""religious propaganda.""  The statement said that Ruhollah Akhundzadeh and his son Al-Morsel Akhundzadeh, in collaboration with the Iranian special services, plotted ""to forcefully change the constitutional structure of the Republic of Azerbaijan and orchestrate armed rebellions with the objective to establish the ""Karima"" state, and to organize assassination attempts on prominent personalities and senior officials,"" the statement reads.  The two men formed clandestine groups on WhatsApp, Telegram and other instant messaging systems, and provided members of the group with a list of government officials and prominent figures, along with their residential and workplace addresses, in order to organize their assassinations.  Azerbaijani media reported that Akhundzadeh intended to send members of the group to Iran, under the guise of religious education, to receive military training.  Last month, Azerbaijani news agencies reported the alleged arrest of the leaders of a group called ""Hosseiniun"" in the Iranian city of Qom.  Tohid Ebrahim Beigli and Orkhan Mamedov are accused by Azerbaijani authorities of planning to establish the ""Karima"" state in Azerbaijan.  In late 2015, Ebrahim Beigli formed the ""Hosseiniun Brigade"" (Hosseinchiler) with 14 Azerbaijani students who were studying in Qom and Mashhad.  The aim of the group was to fight against the ISIS extremist group in Syria and prepare for an armed conflict in Azerbaijan.  In late 2015, Ebrahim Beigli, along with 14 students from the Republic of Azerbaijan who were studying in Qom and Mashhad, formed the ""Hosseiniun Brigade,"" with the stated objective of fighting against the ISIS extremist group in Syria and prepare for an armed conflict in Azerbaijan.  Who is Ruhollah Akhundzadeh?  Ruhollah Akhundzadeh, the deputy of the Islamic Party of Azerbaijan, was sentenced to 11 years in prison in 2011. Following his release, he traveled to Iran in 2020 where he has been actively involved in organizing religious extremist groups closely associated with the Islamic Republic.  The State Security Service of Azerbaijan issued a statement in November last year saying it had conducted an operation against an illegal armed group which operated under the guidance of the Iranian intelligence services. Akhundzadeh was apprehended during the operation.  In the past year alone, Akhundzadeh, with the support of the intelligence agencies of the Islamic Republic, has reportedly made two attempts to establish an armed group aimed at carrying out acts of sabotage and terrorism in Azerbaijan.  According to the newspaper Mosavat, the intelligence agencies of the Islamic Republic are secretly promoting religious extremist ideas in Azerbaijan to encourage citizens to participate in military exercises abroad and finance their activities.  Lasting Tensions Between the Two Neighbors  Baku and Tehran have often had strained relations, with Azerbaijan accusing the Islamic Republic of trying to destabilize the country. Azerbaijan also criticizes Iran for allegedly backing Armenia in the long-standing conflict over Azerbaijan's breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh region.  According to the Baku Post, Iranian intelligence agencies attempted to use Azerbaijani citizens to act against Azerbaijan's interests and in favor of Armenia during the 44-day war between the two countries over Nagorno-Karabakh in 2020.  In turn, Tehran has long accused Baku of fueling separatist sentiments among its sizeable ethnic Azeri minority. The Islamic Republic also fears that Azerbaijani territory could be used for a possible attack against Iran by Israel.  The Azerbaijani authorities strongly reacted to military maneuvers conducted by the Islamic Republic along the Azerbaijan border, calling them provocative and unacceptable.  Tensions between the two neighbors escalated over the past months following a ""terrorist attack"" on the Azerbaijani Embassy in Tehran, the arrest of individuals affiliated with Iranian intelligence services on charges of espionage, the assassination attempt on a member of an Azerbaijani lawmaker, the expulsion of diplomats from both nations, and the opening of an Azerbaijani embassy in Israel.  ""Iran Seeks to Regain Influence"" in the South Caucasus  ""Over the past 30 years, Iran has consistently sought to interfere in Azerbaijan's internal affairs,"" university professor and political analyst Nazem Jafar Soy tells IranWire.  ""This has included sending mullahs to Azerbaijan, influencing the youth of the country through religious teachings in Iran, engaging in espionage, and exploiting the religious sentiments of the Azerbaijani people,"" he added.  But Jafar Soy says that Iran's ""once relatively prominent role in the Caucasus region has diminished"" since the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War, with Turkey taking its place.  ""As a result, Iran seeks to regain influence in the region by using threats and creating espionage groups to portray the area as unsafe and reclaim its position in the Caucasus,"" he adds.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vaXJhbndpcmUuY29tL2VuL3BvbGl0aWNzLzExNjYyNC1jb3VwLXBsb3QtYmxhbWVkLW9uLWlyYW4td2hhdC1kb2VzLXRoZS1pc2xhbWljLXJlcHVibGljLXdhbnQtaW4tYXplcmJhaWphbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

If involved, they should be brought to justice as soon as possible. As the saying goes ‘blood leaves its trail,’” AAC general secretary Ghulam Nabi Zaki said.  The statement came a day after the J&K Police’s special wing, State Investigation Agency (SIA), claimed to have arrested two militants, Javaid Bhat and Zahoor Ahmed Bhat, who were involved in the assassination.  The police said Hizbul Mujahideen commander Abdullah Bangroo had hatched the conspiracy to kill the ex-Mirwaiz.  The AAC has described the killing as “a very painful and tragic part of our lives as well as in the history of Kashmir”. “A visionary leader, who espoused dialogue, tolerance and people’s will as his ideology. The message was carried forward by his son Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, who took over under tragic circumstances,” the AAC spokesman said.  He said the assassinated leader “was a great Islamic preacher, a social reformer and an excellent human being”. His brutal assassination is unpardonable. We feel his absence more with each passing day. As Muslims it’s our faith that those who take human life in such a manner are damned in this world and damned in the hereafter in the court of the supreme being who is the best judge,” the AAC said.  The AAC demanded that those involved in the Hawal massacre, where 70 people participating in the funeral procession were fired upon and killed, “should also be brought to book as soon as possible for complete justice”.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVoaW5kdS5jb20vbmV3cy9uYXRpb25hbC9vdGhlci1zdGF0ZXMvdGhvc2UtaW52b2x2ZWQtaW4ta2lsbGluZy1vZi1leC1taXJ3YWl6LWZhcm9vcS1zaG91bGQtYmUtYnJvdWdodC10by1qdXN0aWNlLWF3YW1pLWFjdGlvbi1jb21taXR0ZWUvYXJ0aWNsZTY2ODYyNzA0LmVjZdIBrwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVoaW5kdS5jb20vbmV3cy9uYXRpb25hbC9vdGhlci1zdGF0ZXMvdGhvc2UtaW52b2x2ZWQtaW4ta2lsbGluZy1vZi1leC1taXJ3YWl6LWZhcm9vcS1zaG91bGQtYmUtYnJvdWdodC10by1qdXN0aWNlLWF3YW1pLWFjdGlvbi1jb21taXR0ZWUvYXJ0aWNsZTY2ODYyNzA0LmVjZS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The heightened security measures have extended to other areas, including Tokyo, with messages on the train system warning of increased security for the summit.  Public areas in major cities across Japan have seen rubbish bins sealed off, coin lockers at train stations put out of operation, and vending machines on subway platforms unplugged and taped off.

In a recorded lecture, the pro-Iranian Shiite cleric repeatedly blamed ""the Jews"" for killing Ali Ibn Abi Talib.  Ali was in fact assassinated, by another Muslim working for a political rival in 661 CE. His son, Hassan, who succeeded his father, was then assassinated nine years later - cementing the schism between the Muslim faithful.  Since Shiites venerate Ali and his son as the rightful successors to their Prophet Mohammad, the death of the two Imam caliphs led to the current division between Sunni and Shiite Islam.  But Iraqi cleric Qais al-Khazali has came up with a new theory: The deaths of Ali and Hassan were at the hands of ""the Jews,"" in particular, the Israeli intelligence service Mossad. First for Ali's death, and then for the deaths of Hassan and his brother Hussein.  ""The Jews! The Jews! The Jews! They murdered Hassan, Ali's son, and they did it using a woman,"" said al-Khazali, claiming that the Mossad used a prostitute for the assassination.  ""The Umayyads were mere collaborators with the Jews. They then assassinated Imam Hussein.

At its heart sits a grand mansion in Federal style. Inspired by Roman design, the architectural discipline emerged out of the American Revolution in the late 1700s and early 1800s, and is defined by its simple square or rectangular design, understated facades and simplified columns and mouldings.  The entrance to the main house, which features a poster of its famous former resident. Photo: Sotheby’s International Realty  In addition to Kennedy, several other prominent Americans have called the mansion at 3017 N Street home, including Georgetown mayor Thomas Beall and former Miss America, Yolande Fox. As a result, the estate has been added to the National Register of Historic Places.  The property was also referenced in the 1933 book, A Portrait of Old Georgetown, by local author Grace Dunlop Ecker, who noted how it had contributed to “the character of Georgetown” for generations.  While many of its original features, including a grand main reception hall, original fireplace surrounds and elegant mouldings, have been maintained, the property’s interiors have been entirely renovated. A spacious primary suite is located on the second floor and is fitted with parquet flooring, a private balcony overlooking the rear gardens and a spa-quality bathroom. The third floor is home to four additional en suite bedrooms, as well as a lofted observation deck.  The property at 3003 N St NW was built in 1880 and has five bedrooms, as well as herringbone oak floors.

She and her children moved in on February 1, 1964, with local newspapers providing a play-by-play account of the family’s movements and belongings, accompanied by photographs of her arriving at her new home with the family’s dog, Brumus. A crowd of onlookers gathered outside in the hope of catching a glimpse of her.  She already had a close association with Georgetown, having arrived in Washington from New York at the age of 10. She went on to attend George Washington University and met then-senator John while she was working as a photographer at the Washington Times-Herald. Their courtship largely took place in and around Georgetown.  The master bedroom in the main house.

A 1964 article in The Washington Post referred to the residence as a “foremost tourist attraction”, with large groups of sightseers lining the street outside the property each weekend, hoping to catch a glimpse of the former first lady. They left rubbish strewn all over the pavement, while heavy traffic, including tour buses, clogged the streets.  In September 1964, she decided to move back to New York.

But the human rights NGOs won’t say anything about it; they only protect the rights of criminals,” stated the president on Twitter.  The National Civil Police (PNC) reported that the officer died after being “attacked” by gang members “while patrolling with other police officers” in Nueva Concepción, Chalatenango, about 85 km north of San Salvador.  This is the fourth Salvadoran police officer killed since Bukele launched his “war” against the gangs 14 months ago and the first one this year, according to Deputy Guillermo Gallegos.  After the incident, a suspected gang member was arrested at the scene.  “Let all the human rights NGOs know that we will devastate these damn killers and their collaborators, we will put them in prison and they will never get out,” emphasized Bukele.  Human rights groups and the Catholic Church have criticized Bukele’s methods for combating the gangs, but his crusade has the support of nine out of ten Salvadorans, according to surveys.  Hours after the officer’s death, the Legislative Assembly approved, with 67 votes out of a total of 84, the extension of the current state of exception, which allows arrests without judicial order, the main tool in Bukele’s “war” against the gangs, which has restored a sense of security on Salvadoran streets.  With this extension, the state of exception will be in effect until June 15.  “Do you see why we must continue with the State of Exception until we completely eradicate this plague? This cowardly murder will not go unpunished. We will make them pay dearly for what they did,” wrote Bukele.  The state of exception was originally declared by the parliament, at Bukele’s request, in response to a surge in homicides that claimed the lives of 87 people from March 25 to 27, 2022.  Since then, 68,720 suspected gang members have been arrested, although about 5,000 have been released for not being linked to these gangs, said the Minister of Justice and Security, Gustavo Villatoro, on Tuesday.

Until the Civil War, U.S. intelligence was virtually nonexistent, and after that, it wasn't very extensive. Lucky for the World War II Allies, the Soviet Union's dedication to spies and intelligence could best be described as paranoia in action.  Gevork Vartanian was a Soviet intelligence officer from Armenia who, at age 19, discovered the Nazis' plan to kill the Allied leadership in Tehran. His team systematically captured and eliminated the assassins' threat.  Soviet-Armenian spy Gevork Vartanian. (Russian Embassy in the United States)  American intelligence before World War II was often as-needed and ad hoc. It could claim some critical successes, but it was far from the global network of informants used by the Soviet Union.  During the war, the USSR housed all its intelligence operations under SMERSH, an umbrella organization composed of hundreds, maybe thousands of operatives.  SMERSH had spies and agents everywhere. As any American Cold Warrior will tell you, Soviet spies were some of the best. They not only spied on the enemy, they were embedded with their own units on the front lines and infiltrated Soviet allies at the highest levels.  The Soviets were so adept at spycraft, Joseph Stalin knew about the development of an atomic bomb before Vice President Harry Truman. So it's no surprise they learned about Operation Long Jump, an assassination plot against Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt -- also known as ""The Big Three.""  Vartanian had been working as an agent in Tehran since before Nazi Germany invaded the USSR. He already had a team of agents called the ""Light Cavalry"" in place and cleared the city of more than 400 Nazi agents before 1943. It made sense to put them in charge of security for the 1943 Tehran Conference between the Big Three, where the leaders would discuss opening a second European front.  The previous year, German Wehrmacht Oberleutnant Paul Siebert, stationed in occupied Ukraine, split a bottle of brandy with his friend. That friend was SS officer Ulrich von Ortel. As the two drank the night away, von Ortel told Siebert that Germany had broken a U.S. Navy radio code and learned about the Tehran Conference.  He then told Siebert about Operation Long Jump and that notorious SS Obersturmbannfuehrer Otto Skorzeny, a saboteur and special operations expert, would lead the assassination squad. Unfortunately for the Germans, Siebert was really Soviet master spy Nikolai Kuznetsov.  Austrian-born Otto Skorzeny during World War II  Word of the plot quickly got to Vartanian in Tehran. The Light Cavalry captured six Nazi radio operators in Iran and tracked the first team of German commandos after they parachuted in near the city of Qom. His team intercepted and arrested the Germans as they traveled on camelback toward the Iranian capital, loaded with weapons.  They then forced the radio operators to report the mission while under Soviet supervision, but one of the radio operators managed to inform Berlin they'd been caught. As a result, Skorzeny's team was never deployed to Iran.  Vartanian spent the next 30 years working as an intelligence officer for the Soviet Union, eventually receiving the title Hero of the Soviet Union, the highest award the country could give. His involvement in preventing Operation Long Jump was kept a secret until 2000, and Vartanian died in 2012 after a very long, very secret career.  -- Blake Stilwell can be reached at blake.stilwell@military.com.

He filmed the motorcade traveling through Dealey Plaza with his new, single-lens, Kodak Brownie 8 camera so she could see the president.  At the sound of gunfire, he changed locations and filmed the president’s car speeding through the Triple Underpass, as well as bystanders running toward the grassy knoll. His 8mm color will join the museum’s photographic record of the events before, during and after the assassination. The home movie was featured in Life Magazine and Josiah Thompson's book, Six Seconds in Dallas, both published in 1967. The House Select Committee on Assassinations studied the film in the late '70s.

With his Argus movie camera, he captured 10 seconds of the assassination’s aftermath. It shows his children, unaware of the president’s condition, happily waving at the limousine as it speeds toward the entrance ramp to Stemmons Freeway and to Parkland Hospital.  Daniel returned two days later and filmed the memorials left near the Texas School Book Depository. The film camera, on loan since 1996, is now part of the permanent collection of The Sixth Floor Museum.

"assassination","2023-05-10","Not Discerned","{""Bogota"", ""DistritoCapital"", ""Colombia""}","Wed 17 May 2023 21:03:55","Salvatore Mancuso, former commander of right-wing paramilitary groups, has offered four days of tribunal testimony.  Bogotá, Colombia – A former strongman has wrapped up testimony before Colombia’s Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP) tribunal this week, offering a harrowing look into paramilitary assassination programmes orchestrated during the country’s decades-long internal conflict.  Salvatore Mancuso, who used the nom de guerre “Triple Zero”, was one of the primary leaders of paramilitary forces in the country in the late ’90s and early 2000s.  Over four days of testimony, ending Tuesday, Mancuso offered insight into groups that Colombia’s Peace Commission has since described as “death squads”.  As the erstwhile commander of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), a coalition of right-wing paramilitary groups, Mancuso described the murder and forced disappearances of political activists and other individuals seen as sympathetic to left-wing groups and causes.  “These were assassinations,” he said on the first day of testimony, May 10. “There is no other word for it.”  Mancuso has previously admitted to thousands of counts of various crimes before the JEP, in an attempt to earn leniency and avoid further legal proceedings in Colombia. He gave this week’s testimony by video from the United States, where he previously served 12 years on drug trafficking charges.  “We weren’t told just to kill. We were told to hide the bodies and ensure they were never found,” Mancuso said from a screen before the court.  To cover up their crimes, Mancuso explained his forces built crematoriums to burn the bodies of those killed. Other victims were disposed of in the Catatumbo River, which separates Colombia and Venezuela in the Catatumbo region.  His testimony also corroborated longstanding accusations that paramilitary groups planned their attacks in direct coordination with the Colombian government, as well as the private sector.  A child of state ‘parapolitics’  Mancuso has claimed he worked directly with the Colombian army and police, as well as with the Administrative Security Department (DAS), the country’s disgraced former intelligence agency.  The DAS was disbanded in 2011 amid accusations of human rights violations and the wiretapping of journalists and judges.  Together with the paramilitary forces, those agencies coordinated “kill lists” identifying individuals the government wanted silenced, Mancuso alleged.  “In my capacity as a hinge between public forces and self-defence groups, I ordered the assassination of hundreds of people. I’m a legitimate child of state ‘parapolitics’,” he said on Tuesday, using a term for the intersection of “paramilitary” and “politics”.  According to Mancuso, one of the targets that DAS ordered for assassination was Gustavo Petro, Colombia’s current president and a former rebel fighter who was, at the time, a congressman.  Mancuso also indicated that major private companies helped finance the paramilitary operations through a programme called “Convivir”, in part to protect their domestic infrastructure. The JEP tribunal, however, has yet to verify the claims made in Mancuso’s testimony.  Mancuso left his position as commander in 2005 as part of a controversial peace process with Colombia’s paramilitary forces.  Critics divided over testimony  Observers were split over the revelations from Mancuso’s testimony this week — and how much they would help advance JEP’s mission to investigate the crimes and abuses committed over Colombia’s nearly six-decade-long internal conflict.  Claudia Julieta Duque, a journalist who had been tortured by the DAS, was less than impressed by the four-day judicial hearing.  It was a “victimiser reaffirming what victims have been saying for more than 20 years”, she told Al Jazeera. “He said many things that were already known.”      Elizabeth Dickinson, a senior policy analyst in Colombia for the International Crisis Group, was nevertheless intrigued by some of the insight Mancuso offered.  “One of the most striking and new points of the testimony was Mancuso’s discussion of a period in the late ‘90s when Colombia was receiving increased scrutiny in over rising civilian casualties,” she said.  “And the order, in response, from security forces to the paramilitaries was: Keep doing what you’re doing with these scorched-earth tactics. But instead of leaving evidence of this violence, you need to start disappearing people.”  She said it was “shockingly nefarious” that the government’s response was to allegedly double down on state-sponsored violence rather than re-evaluate its actions.  What’s next for Colombia’s peace process?  When asked what Mancuso’s testimony means for the present day, Dickinson explained that the phenomenon of paying criminal groups for protection — whether willingly or through coercion — is an “ongoing” problem in Colombia.  “The JEP is looking specifically for more information about this. That’s why Mancuso is testifying,” she said. Colombia’s Peace Commission has repeatedly stated that impunity for crimes committed during the internal conflict is a barrier to contemporary peace-building.  Ginna Morelo, an investigative reporter, has written a book, The Voice of the Pencils, that describes an assault that paramilitary forces launched on Colombia’s University of Cordoba — an attack Mancuso addressed in his testimony this week.  She explained that his testimony “contributes to the reconstruction of the truth. Although it hurts so much time has passed without knowing the truth.”  She told Al Jazeera that several victims had told her afterwards that “they had never heard that the DAS was behind the crimes inflicted on them”.  She hoped new information could bring closure to those who suffered during the civil war. The victims, she said, “live in an endless transition in search of clarification and reconciliation that has so far been elusive”.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLzUvMTcvZXgtcGFyYW1pbGl0YXJ5LWxlYWRlci10ZXN0aWZpZXMtYWJvdXQtYXNzYXNzaW5hdGlvbnMtaW4tY29sb21iaWHSAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5hbGphemVlcmEuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzLzIwMjMvNS8xNy9leC1wYXJhbWlsaXRhcnktbGVhZGVyLXRlc3RpZmllcy1hYm91dC1hc3Nhc3NpbmF0aW9ucy1pbi1jb2xvbWJpYQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","1963-11-22","Not Discerned","{""Dallas"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 17:17:01","The ground seems to be shifting with respect to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Displaying little or no fear of either the national-security establishment or of being labeled a “conspiracy theorist,” an increasing number of people are now openly and publicly acknowledging what has increasingly become obvious: that the U.S. national-security establishment orchestrated and carried out Kennedy’s assassination as part of a national-security regime-change operation.  This is a positive and healthy sign. Getting America back on the right track requires confronting this dark legacy of America as a national-security state. That includes confronting all of the Pentagon’s and CIA’s state-sponsored assassinations, but especially the Kennedy assassination. Libertarians can help lead the way out of this darkness by openly and publicly acknowledging and addressing what happened on November 22, 1963, and bringing the light of truth to the American people about this sordid event.  That’s the purpose of my new video series “The JFK Assassination: Sixty Years Later,” which so far consists of six 30-minute episodes.  In the immediate aftermath of the assassination, there was no reasonable possibility that anyone was going to be able to prove that the military-intelligence establishment was behind the assassination. There were lots of anomalies and unusual occurrences that were enough to raise eyebrows, but they certainly weren’t enough to convict the national-security establishment beyond a reasonable doubt.  For example, immediately after the shooting, there were men on the “grassy knoll” who identified themselves as Secret Service agents. They diverted people away from that particular area, which was located in front of the president’s limousine when the shots rang out. The Secret Service later stated that it had no agents in that area.  If the assassination was really committed by a “lone nut” who purportedly shot from the president’s rear, who were those men on the grassy knoll who falsely identified themselves as Secret Service agents? Is that enough to convict the national-security establishment of having orchestrated the assassination? Of course not. But it is certainly enough to raise eyebrows.  At that time, assassinating a president was not a federal crime. That means that this was a straight murder case under Texas state law. The entity that had sole jurisdiction over the crime was Dallas County.  The possibility that Dallas County District Attorney Henry Wade, a conservative Democrat, would even consider targeting the military-intelligence establishment with the crime was non-existent. As an establishment public official, his mind would have never moved in that direction. In fact, he immediately concluded that the assassination had been carried out as part of an international communist conspiracy. But displaying a classic mindset of deference to authority, Wade quickly acceded to President Lyndon Johnson’s demand to abandon the communist-conspiracy allegation and settle for a lone-nut theory of the assassination.  Moreover, there was never any reasonable possibility that any of the orchestrators of the assassination or any of the shooters would talk. These were professionals. All of them understood the need for absolute secrecy, especially given that this was the assassination of a U.S. president. In fact, from the inception of the CIA, the policy had always been to never put any reference to any state-sponsored assassination in writing.  However, as I am demonstrating in my new video series, the Achilles heel of the assassination was always the autopsy that the national-security establishment conducted on President Kennedy’s body after the assassination. That’s because the people who participated in the autopsy were not part of the assassination itself. Therefore, they didn’t have the same incentive to keep silent as those who orchestrated and carried out the assassination itself.  This is why the military’s autopsy was “classified” and why participants in the autopsy were sworn to secrecy and forced to sign written secrecy oaths. Enlisted personnel who participated in the autopsy were severely threatened with court-martial and criminal prosecution if they ever revealed what they had seen or done during the autopsy.  Among the most unusual — and revealing — aspects of the military autopsy was the response of the mainstream press. No one questioned that it was the military-intelligence establishment that was carrying out the autopsy. It was considered to be perfectly normal. The acquiescence of the mainstream press revealed the extent to which the press had come to accept that America had become a military nation — that is, one in which the federal government was now controlled by the military-intelligence establishment.  The secrecy surrounding the assassination was extremely successful. To this day, while we can identify likely suspects in the CIA and the military who orchestrated the assassination, there is still insufficient evidence to convict any of them beyond a reasonable doubt. We also do not know — and will never know — the identities of the people who actually did the shooting.  That, however, is irrelevant. What matters is that the evidence establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that this was, in fact, a national-security regime-change operation, one no different in principle than the ones carried out against political leaders in Iran (1953), Guatemala (1954), and Congo (1961) and that would later be carried out against the democratically elected president of Chile (1973).  To what evidence of guilt am I referring? The evidence surrounding the autopsy. While the plotters were highly successful in maintaining strict secrecy surrounding the autopsy for a very long period of time, ultimately the dam of secrecy cracked open, especially during the term of the Assassination Records Review Board in the 1990s.  But that was 30 years after the assassination! That is a very long time. That’s a very effective cover-up, especially because by that time, the mainstream press had fallen under the complete control of the national-security establishment and, therefore, was not permitted to investigate the evidence of fraud in the autopsy that was uncovered by the ARRB. (I’ll be covering such fraud in my new video series. In the meantime, see my books The Kennedy Autopsy, The Kennedy Autopsy 2, and An Encounter with Evil: The Abraham Zapruder Story.)  For example, as I detail in the early episodes of my new series, the evidence is overwhelming that military-intelligence personnel sneaked President Kennedy’s body into the Bethesda, Maryland, military morgue almost 1 and 1/2 hours before the official entry time of 8 pm on the evening of the assassination. Why would they do that? And why would they lie about that? Why would they cover it up? What did they do to JFK’s body during that 1 and 1/2 hours? Alas, not one investigative reporter for any mainstream newspaper investigated the matter. By the 1990s, the national-security establishment’s control over the mainstream press had become complete.  The most important part of the Kennedy assassination is the “why” of the assassination. By understanding why the national-security establishment deemed it necessary to orchestrate one of its patented regime-change operations on American soil, we can gain an understanding of why America is mired in perpetual war, strife, conflict, militarism, out-of-control spending, monetary debauchery, a national police state, and empire. (See FFF’s book JFK’s War with the National Security Establishment: Why Kennedy Was Assassinated by Douglas Horne. Also, see JFK and the Unspeakable: Why He Died and Why It Matters by James W. Douglass.)  If you are not already doing so, I would invite you to view my new series: The JFK Assassination: Sixty Years Later — Episode 1. If you like it, please recommend it to your friends and mailing lists. As more Americans become aware of this dark legacy of America as a national-security state and, equally important, as more Americans lose their fear of being labeled “conspiracy theorists,” we stand a greater chance of restoring liberty, peace, prosperity, and harmony to our land.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZmZi5vcmcvMjAyMy8wNS8xNy9yZXN0b3JpbmctbGliZXJ0eS1yZXF1aXJlcy1jb25mcm9udGluZy10aGUtamZrLWFzc2Fzc2luYXRpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"assassination","2023-05-09","Not Discerned","{""Oru"", ""Harju"", ""Estonia""}","Tue 16 May 2023 07:28:06","•Charges Security Operatives To Fish Out Perpetrators  By Onyekachi Eze  The Grow Orlu Project, a group saddled with the responsibility of fostering a united and peaceful Orlu zone to create the enabling environment for its growth and development has condemned in strong terms the gruesome killing of its general Coordinator of all the twelve Coordinators that make up the Imo West Senatorial District (Orlu Zone), Captain Tony Enoch (Rtd).  Reacting over the ugly situation, through a press statement by the Organization, the Facilitator/Director General of the Grow Orlu Project, Prince Nixon Okwara described the incident as most unfortunate and barbaric.  Captain Tony Enoch was gunned down by assailants late hours of Tuesday, May 9, 2023 on his way coming back from an APC Stakeholders meeting held in his Oru East Local Government Area of Imo State.  Against this backdrop, Prince Nixon Okwara who couldn’t contain his tears stated that it has become so worrisome why people could condescend so low and inhuman as to taking another person’s life.  He regretted that Captain Tony Enoch’s assassination was still a rude shock to the Grow Orlu family, the Kpakpando political family, to Oru East, Imo State and Nigeria at large, especially those who encountered him while he lived.  The Director General recalled that due to his outstanding nature and Leadership dexterity, the murdered Tony Enoch was entrusted with the position of Coordinator of all the Coordinators at the inauguration of the Grow Orlu Project held on July 9, 2022.  Alas, when it was almost time to enjoy his Labour, his life was cut short by yet-to-be identified killers.  Prince Nixon Okwara who also doubles as a member of the Presidential Campaign Council for Bola Ahmed Tinubu/Kashim Shettima passionately enthused, “Quite a horrible Tuesday!! Our hearts are heavy with grief, sadness, and pain.  “Capt. Enoch was a great and exceptional member and the general Coordinator of our team, “The Grow Orlu Project” who made significant contributions to our group. His smart disposition, intellect, tireless work ethic, and unwavering commitment to the victory of our party and candidates were made manifest in that successful outing on the 25th of February elections.  “This is one but many losses to us, “The Grow Orlu Project”, the Kpakpando family, and the entire APC family. We condemn in strong terms this dastardly act and senseless act of violence in our region and call for justice. Capt. will not die in vain.  “To his immediate family, we share in their grief at this difficult time. Capt. will be missed by all who know him, both for his professionalism and dedication to the assignments. His killers will never know peace both here on Earth and beyond”.  The sober Facilitator of the Grow Orlu Project however called of the State Government, the security agencies to as a matter of urgent State importance fish out the perpetrators of the heinous crime so as to save the State from further tragedy.

"assassination","2022-04-05","Not Discerned","{""Tehran"", ""Tehran"", ""Iran""}","Tue 16 May 2023 13:54:02","New Delhi: Russia’s largest airline Aeroflot has sent an Airbus A330 for maintenance to Iran’s largest airline Mahan Air, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported Monday.  In a two-minute video filmed at Mahan Air’s maintenance hangar in the Imam Khomeini International Airport outside Tehran and released on IRNA’s social media platforms, a reporter can be heard saying that repair work on the Aeroflot aircraft, originally built in 2011, has commenced.  “The market for commercial aircraft repair and maintenance services is as valuable and extensive as the commercial aircraft’s sales market itself. Accordingly, for years, we have been witnessing the achievements and capabilities of [Iran] to localise the needs of this industry,” the IRNA reporter says, labelling Mahan Air’s maintenance hangar as “one of the most well-known and strategic centres” serving Iranian and foreign customers.  According to aviation news platform Simply Flying, the Airbus A330 had departed Moscow’s Sheremetyevo International Airport on 5 April and arrived at the Imam Khomeini International Airport the following morning.  This development comes amid US-led sanctions on both Aeroflot and Mahan Air due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and an alleged plot to assassinate Saudi Arabia’s ambassador to America in 2011.  The engagement between Aeroflot and Mahan Air also serves as an example of the strengthening of relations between Iran and Russia, following such sanctions.  In August 2022, Simply Flying reported that the two nations had signed a cooperation agreement for Iranian-made equipment and aircraft parts as well as carrying out “repair and maintenance services and technical support” of Russian aircraft.  This year has seen the relationship between Iran and Russia evolve further, with Tehran inking a deal to buy Sukhoi Su-35 fighter jets from Moscow in March. The two countries also linked their interbank communication and transfer systems to facilitate trade and transactions in the light of US sanctions.

His release brought an uneasy calm, but the stage is set for a more serious clash.  Security escort a vehicle carrying Pakistan’s former Prime Minister Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi after their court appearance, in Lahore, Pakistan, May 15, 2023.  Advertisement  Pakistanis could be forgiven for waking up on Tuesday morning and questioning whether the previous week’s events were an unnerving nightmare.  The world’s fifth most populous country is no stranger to political unrest. No prime minister has ever completed their tenure in Pakistan’s history, but never before has a politician challenging the country’s all-powerful military and intelligence services, known as the establishment, enjoyed such public support.  One week ago, on May 9, former Prime Minister Imran Khan was violently beaten and then detained by the country’s paramilitary. This led to several days of rioting across Pakistan.  While he has since been released – after Pakistan’s Supreme Court ruled that his detention on an alleged land fraud charge was “invalid” and “unlawful” – the current stalemate will be temporary, not permanent.

Ousted from power in April 2022 in a no confidence vote after falling out with the country’s establishment, Khan’s popularity is now at an all-time high. There is little doubt that if free elections are held, as planned, in the autumn, he will return as prime minister. The Pakistani people are seemingly prepared to take on the country’s establishment, for the first time in history, in an attempt to ensure that happens.  With neither side backing down, what comes next is likely to involve serious unrest. Things are sure to get worse before they get better in Pakistan, which is also already enduring the gravest economic crisis in the country’s history.  It was unsurprising to see Khan in the dock last week. Pakistan’s establishment and the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party – headed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif – seeks to disqualify Khan from politics.  Advertisement  The former international cricket captain is facing more than 140 criminal cases. In the latest, it was alleged that Khan and his wife, the Sufi mystic Bushra Wattoo, secured lucrative real estate in exchange for carrying out favors for Malik Riaz Hussain, one of Pakistan’s wealthiest businessmen, while Khan was prime minister.  Khan and his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party said the case was politically motivated. The PML-N said Khan should face trial. On Friday, after the country’s Supreme Court sided with the former premier, Khan was released and returned to his home in Lahore.  It seems certain, though, that Khan will be arrested again. He has only been granted bail until Wednesday and Sharif and his allies have suggested he will be detained again this week.  On Sunday, Khan himself suggested he would be jailed for 10 years for sedition after his supporters had rioted following his arrest.  “Absolutely, Mr. Khan will be arrested again. We are looking at a judiciary in Pakistan which is fragmented and can be influenced,” argued Dr. Avinash Paliwal, associate professor in International Relations at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS).  “The ruling [on Friday] was made by pro-Khan judges within the Supreme Court and now the Army will try to fix that. It will 100 percent happen at some point that he will be behind bars and charges will be brought against him that no court can overrule.”  In many ways, Khan, a populist politician, is a victim of his own success. Since his ousting, in April 2022, which directly followed a spectacular falling out with the military, his popularity has surged.  Enjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.  Khan has been able to successfully exploit growing frustration among the Pakistani public towards Sharif for his inability to address the country’s economic woes and the Army’s continued meddling in public policy.  Food inflation is running at 40 percent, the highest in Asia, and approximately 70 million Pakistanis are going hungry, as per a March study by the Wilson Center, a leading U.S. think tank.  Hospitals have run out of many life-saving medicines, including those used in diabetes, heart and kidney disease treatment, while a lack of funding meant Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, one of Pakistan’s four provinces, suspended free medical care on May 2.  Advertisement  Relief does not seem imminent, either. Negotiations with the International Monetary Fund for over $1.1 billion in funding have broken down – in part due to Sharif’s reluctance to impose further unpopular austerity measures on the population as an election draws near.  Certainly, there have been decades of economic mismanagement in Pakistan. The country has consistently borrowed beyond its means and failed to diversify its tax base. And Khan’s detractors argue that he engaged in corruption, as have the Sharifs and Pakistan’s other political dynasty, the Bhuttos.  Nevertheless, Khan has carefully crafted a victim narrative since he was removed from power and has convinced a significant majority of Pakistanis that only he can reform the country’s stagnant political and economic apparatus.  His approval rating in February was 61 percent, according to a Gallup Pakistan survey, with Shehbaz Sharif trailing far behind at 32 percent.  “Imran Khan, politically, has captured the imagination of most of the country, certainly in Punjab and that is not going to go down. The people’s power is with him,” said Paliwal.  “He wants an early election and if the authorities give him an honest vote, then he will win.”  The establishment will do anything they can to stop him. Khan would fail to do their bidding; he could strip them of their power and even seek to jail senior military or political figures in revenge.  Khan has accused Major General Faisal Naseer, a senior military figure and Sharif of being behind an assassination attempt in November in which he was shot in the legs four times. While on his release from prison, he accused the country’s new chief of army staff, General Asim Munir, of being behind his arrest.  Khan and Munir have a long-standing feud. While he was prime minister, Khan removed Munir as the head of Pakistan’s intelligence services after the latter began allegedly investigating his third wife, Wattoo, for corruption.  We are now likely to see Sharif and his establishment allies take further action against the judiciary and the PTI’s leadership to weaken protection of Khan.  On Monday, hundreds of members of the PML-N, armed with sticks, broke into the country’s Supreme Court to threaten its judges.  Pakistan’s parliament further announced it would set up a committee to prepare a case against the judge, Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial, who had ordered Khan’s release.  Advertisement  Enjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.  Following Khan’s arrest, the PTI called on Pakistanis to take to the streets and it is certain to do so again if Khan is re-arrested. The violence that followed was unprecedented in the country’s history, as large swathes of angry protesters torched military buildings, including the army’s headquarters in Rawalpindi.  Only when Khan was released on Friday did unrest subside. The PTI claims at least 47 of its supporters were killed by the military; the latter puts the death toll at nine.  Khan says 7,000 PTI workers – including much of the party’s senior leadership – have been jailed. Claims of torture are widespread. The elderly relatives and minor children of PTI members have also been arrested in an attempt to lure their relatives out of hiding.  Sharif has said he will come down with an “iron fist” against the protesters and mass arrests will now follow. The ability of Sharif and the establishment to incite fear among Pakistanis is perhaps their best chance of holding onto power.  “To me, it is clear that only one – either Mr. Khan or the army chief – can survive this crisis, politically,” argued Uzair Younus, director of the Pakistan Initiative at the Atlantic Council, a U.S.-based think tank.  “Over the next few weeks, how this situation plays out will come down to General Munir and the armed forces ability to assert themselves and then Mr. Khan and the PTI’s ability to maintain public protests and the momentum.”  Several further variables could influence events in Pakistan. First, there appear to be fractures among the country’s senior military leaders, although it is unclear as to their severity.  Many commanders remain pro-Khan from his time as premier, and it was notable that during the recent violence former army figureheads, many now living abroad, directed protesters. Several acting military commanders also refused to take a heavy-handed approach against PTI supporters.  During previous crises, foreign powers, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States, have also intervened to mediate. This has not occurred this time around, at least openly. But it is unlikely that China, which has invested around $65 billion in Pakistan as part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, or India, which has fought four wars with its neighbor, will continue to watch on if law and order deteriorates.  One victor from the crisis is likely to be the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an Islamic militant group allied with the Afghan Taliban, who called off their ceasefire with the Pakistani state in November.  The TTP has since launched daily attacks against the police and military. January 2023 was the deadliest month for the country’s security forces in a decade, with one such suicide attack on a mosque in Peshawar killing 83 people.  A united front will have to be presented against the emboldened TTP – otherwise Pakistan risks descending into total anarchy.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlZGlwbG9tYXQuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvcGFraXN0YW4taW4tdGhlLWV5ZS1vZi10aGUtcG9saXRpY2FsLXN0b3JtL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2023-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Ganjam"", ""Orissa"", ""India""}","Tue 16 May 2023 09:01:56","Mudslinging is not a new phenomenon in world of politics since it is said to have appeared in some form or the other in electoral battle since 1828 in the US Presidential election; 2008 Senate race in North Carolina and the political race between the then incumbent President John Quincy Adams and challenger Andrew Jackson in 1828.  The practice of mudslinging, smear campaigning, or forming conspiracy by any political leader against his opponent with sole intention to defame a leader with probity in public life and/or to tarnish his image to take political mileage, however, can hardly succeed as ultimately truth prevails, sooner or later. Most of the politicians in India often use ‘mudslinging’ as the most powerful weapon or tool against their opponents.  Since times immemorial, it has been believed that, truth always triumphs and this dictum has been rightly emphasised by Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhi who brought freedom for the country used to define political course to remain “without malice and in a strictly non violent manner,” but now malice is deeply rooted in politics of all shades in which mudslinging has substantially grown as a culture, breeding various connotations, namely, smear campaign, character assassination, dirty politics, negative campaign, defamation, outracing each other which are disastrous for the health of democracy. No political party seems to be an exception from such Machiavellian culture.  In the year 2000, a Congress worker of Poirashi GP of Ganjam block had filed a false affidavit against the then Deputy Speaker of Assembly Rama Chandra Panda, willfully dragging his name to an incident of a crime perpetuated by local Leftist elements, notwithstanding the soaring relationship Panda had with the local Leftists, which was used to orchestrate a political campaign in the Chhatrapur Assembly constituency against Panda.  As a result, Panda had informed the then Speaker of the Assembly not to chair Assembly proceedings till his name was cleared in the Crime Branch inquiry. It was also then whispered in the town that, some Congress leaders eventually had met the then DIG inquiring the matter at the IRE Guest House to raise a complaint against Panda on the basis of the false affidavit.  The catchphrase the ""Truth always triumphs"" has come true though little late. In the last week of January 2023, Panda was felicitated on completion of 50 years of his political journey from the tiny industrial town Ganjam, where he had laid country’s first and historic farmers’ movement (1970-71) against water and air pollution in which he and 400 farmers and youths were imprisoned causing visit of Parliamentary Committee headed by late MP Brahmananda Panda to the area to study the environmental problems which eventually submitted its report to the Parliament suggesting remedial measures. This impressive felicitation programme in which thousands of local people attended is understood to be a sequel to non-invitation to Panda by the local MLA earlier on the party’s foundation day held at village Kushapalli.  The success of this gathering, however, not only sent ripples to various quarters but also produced multiple side effects and one such fallout was that, the then Congress youth leader Khalli Reddy who himself participated in the ‘show of strength’ cum felicitation meeting, later called on Panda at his residence at Brahmapur in the presence of a former Councilor of Ganjam NAC Lakshmi Padhi and advocate Pramod Panda and apologised to Rama Chandra Panda for his 2000 bogus affidavit candidly confessing that he filed the same at the behest of a prominent Congress leader of Brahmapur who eventually is now in BJD. This sensitive exposure of Reddy has proved how some new breed and ambitious politicians can settle political scores against their rivals or political opponents to satisfy their political interests and can go to any extent even to defame a honest leader having probity in public life.  This writer was present during Reddy’s disclosure. In his quest for truth, the writer contacted one of the outspoken and vibrant Congress leaders of Ganjam advocate Pitabas Panda, who too expressed his regret while further attributing the incident to the invisible hand of a former Congress MLA of a neighboring district in the incident. When this writer sought reaction from former Deputy Speaker Panda he said he had already forgotten the incident and wished almighty to bless the indulgent not to repeat such act in future against any one.  There may not always be legal repercussions for mudslinging, but there can be social backfiring. If miscalculated, mudslinging often can make the mudslinger cut a sorry figure.  Now, one might ask: Shouldn't politicians or public figures, face repercussions for mudslinging? According to Joseph Comunale, it is in fact a crime to make false public accusations with knowledge that the claims are indeed false.  Such a crime can lead to libel or defamation lawsuits in the eyes of law. However, proving such a crime can be extremely difficult. i.e., it is difficult to verify that someone may have been aware that he was making a false claim and, therefore, deduce he was knowingly lying with an intent to harm.  There are a number of such incidents of political mudslinging and conspiracy, allegation and counter allegation against each other in Indian politics. Take the example of Telangana Welfare and Civil Supplies Minister, Gangula Kamalakar’s allegation against BJP State president Bandi Sanjay Kumar alleging his hand in a recent question paper leaking incident reportedly with an attempt to malign and defame the BRS Government in Telangana.

Parhar writes that over the past 40 to 50 years, Sikhs have earned a highly respected position in foreign countries through their hard work and talent. Unfortunately, these achievements are now being overshadowed by the actions of those who are intent on sowing discord.  The stain of terrorism on Sikhs associated with the Air India plane incident in June 1985 has not yet been washed away, and daily fights over money boxes and control in gurudwaras, international students’ hooliganism, Sikh youths being caught in drug smuggling, killings in gang wars, unscrupulous and unconstitutional entrances into politics, and immigration fraud are bringing shame to the entire community.  These people have been suppressing the voice of the general public in the name of freedom of speech for some time now. Threats on social media, obscene language, slurs, and character assassination are being used to stop people from speaking their minds, according to Parhar in the Khalsa Vox article.  Sikh scholar Ajmer Singh in one of his videos mentioned that Amritpal Singh was involved in a troll army, which harasses people with the aforementioned actions.  “We could indeed scrutinize the violent actions and hooliganism being committed by this small section of our community in India and abroad, but how will you counter the impact it’s having on the perception of all Sikhs,” asks Parhar.

The musical by David Byrne is based on the rise and fall of former Philippine first lady Imelda Marcos.  David Byrne's Imelda Marcos musical is coming to Broadway in June  Jose Llana, who plays the role of Ferdinand Marcos Sr., said the musical is a cautionary tale for the world to see.  ""[It’s] showing people what happens when you elect popular candidates in a very popular election,” he said. “Then they have a party for 20 years. But what’s even more important is we show what happens after. Hangover comes and the lights turn on, and it’s called the People Power Revolution.”  Disney Princess Arielle Jacobs, known for her role as Princess Jasmine in Aladdin on Broadway, will step into the shoes of Imelda.  She believes this part of Philippine history is a story that needs to be told to a new generation.  “There's so many democracies at stake all around the world,” she said. “And there are countries all around the world that [want] to rewrite history.”  Jacobs added: “I think “Here Lies Love” shines a light on our history and it really shines a light more specifically on the people who led the revolution, the people who fought for democracy.”  “Here Lies Love” takes the audience back to the 70’s and the 80’s disco club scene in New York.  Bryne said the disco-driven musical brings to life Imelda’s lavish lifestyle in New York, and her endless parties with the Big Apple’s elite.  It will feature an all-Filipino cast for the first time on Broadway.  Conrad Ricamora plays the late senator Benigno “Ninoy” Aquino III, whose assassination in 1983, led to the bloodless revolt three years later.  “There’s never been an all-Filipino cast on Broadway,” he said. “We’re all energized and extra excited to tell our story in a revolutionary way.”  Playing the role of Ninoy’s mother Aurora is award-winning singer and actress Lea Salonga.  Lea Salonga joins cast of 'Here Lies Love' on Broadway  “On one level, the song is gorgeous but on a whole other level, it’s heartbreaking because this character is talking about her son,” she said.  “Here Lies Love” previews start on June 17 and opens on July 20 at the Broadway Theater in New York City.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5hYnMtY2JuLmNvbS9saWZlLzA1LzE2LzIzL2hlcmUtbGllcy1sb3ZlLWNhc3Qtb24tcmV0ZWxsaW5nLW1hcnRpYWwtbGF30gFXaHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLmFicy1jYm4uY29tL2FtcC9saWZlLzA1LzE2LzIzL2hlcmUtbGllcy1sb3ZlLWNhc3Qtb24tcmV0ZWxsaW5nLW1hcnRpYWwtbGF3?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","1963-11-22","Not Discerned","{""Dallas"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 16:30:08","Thank you for supporting our journalism. This article is available exclusively for our subscribers, who help fund our work at The Baltimore Sun.  Sen. Chris Van Hollen, left, and Sen. Ben Cardin often appear together to draw attention to federal projects in Maryland but, in their roles as U.S. senators, pursue global causes, including human rights and press freedom. (Amy Davis, Baltimore Sun)  Human rights tops Ben Cardin’s list of accomplishments as a senator — specifically, his sponsorship of the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, a law imposing economic sanctions on bad actors in Russia and around the world.  There are other items on Cardin’s list: Subsidies for small business; federal funds for the Chesapeake Bay; improving ways for Americans to save for retirement; addressing health disparities.  Advertisement  But the Magnitsky Act sits at the top.  That says something not only about Cardin but about the scope of the work of a serious U.S. senator, something often lost in the political antics and demagoguery inflicted on us daily by buffoons and nascent fascists in the House of Representatives and the capitals of red states.  Advertisement  Cardin, at 79 the senior of Maryland’s two Democratic senators, has decided not to run for reelection in 2024. The person who wins his seat will not only have to be responsive to the needs of Marylanders but have a grasp of the far-reaching and complex issues that affect the nation and the world. A senator has to paint the big picture and stand up for freedom and human rights at home and abroad.  That too often goes without saying, so I’ll cite two examples — global causes Cardin and Sen. Chris Van Hollen pursue when they’re not, as they were Monday in Baltimore, addressing issues immediate to the state they represent.  The Magnitsky Act is named for the late Sergei Magnitsky, the Ukraine-born tax adviser who exposed multimillion-dollar fraud and corruption in Vladimir Putin’s regime and Russia’s state-owned businesses. Magnitsky was arrested on dubious charges and imprisoned for 11 months without a trial and without the medical attention he badly needed. He died in his cell in November 2009 at age 37. His untreated ailments or a beating, or both, caused Magnitsky’s death.  Cardin and the late Arizona Republican, John McCain, sponsored the Magnitsky Act in the Senate. It passed overwhelmingly in 2012, barring Russians and other human rights violators from entering the U.S. and freezing any assets they held in American banks. The law makes an important connection between trade agreements and human rights.  “America’s strength is in our values,” Cardin has said. “We must defend human rights and hold abusers accountable.”  These days, we don’t hear enough of that kind of high-minded talk, delivered with sober sincerity.  Magnitsky sanctions came to the forefront again in 2018, after the brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi journalist and Washington Post columnist. While U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that the Saudi Crown Prince ordered an assassination team to kill Khashoggi, the Trump administration refused to enact Magnitsky sanctions against him. And while President Joe Biden called Saudi Arabia “a pariah state” during the 2020 campaign and later applied Magnitzky to more than a dozen individuals connected with Khashoggi’s murder, his administration concluded the Crown Prince had head of state immunity.  Cardin still disagrees.  Advertisement  “I was disappointed,” he says, “to see that the Biden administration did not directly sanction Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, especially since we know from our intelligence community that the crown prince approved the killing of Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul, Turkey. I was pleased to see the administration applying Global Magnitsky sanctions on 17 individuals for their roles in the brutal murder, but I do believe we remain far from delivering justice for Mr. Khashoggi and his family.”  Still, based on the latest report published in the Federal Register, there’s good reason to see human rights as Cardin’s crowning achievement: Magnitsky sanctions have been applied against 450 corrupt actors so far, and at least 12 other nations have adopted a Magnitsky-style apparatus for punishing human rights violators.  Van Hollen, meanwhile, has taken up press freedom, at home and abroad.  Among his current efforts is a push for an independent investigation of the death of journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, a Palestinian-American and longtime television reporter for Al-Jazeera. She was fatally shot in the head a year ago this month while covering an Israeli military raid in the occupied West Bank.  Palestinian authorities claim Abu Akleh, who was wearing a helmet and press vest, had been killed by an armor-piercing bullet fired by an Israeli soldier. Israel said the source of the bullet could not be determined. A team of New York Times journalists used satellite imagery and video taken on the ground to conclude that the fatal bullet probably came from an Israeli military convoy and was most likely fired by a soldier from an elite unit.  Last week, on the anniversary of Abu Akleh’s death, Van Hollen renewed his call for an independent investigation.

"assassination","2023-12-06","21:30:00","{""Madrid"", ""Colima"", ""Mexico""}","Tue 16 May 2023 23:31:02","In a letter published on her website and social media, Vice President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner has confirmed that she will not be running for president, or any other office. Kirchner accused the judiciary and the Supreme Court of imposing a “political ban” not only against her but the Peronist party as a whole.  “I’ve already said this on December 6, 2022. I am not going to be the mascota del poder (puppet for the powerful) for any candidacy,” she said. That day, she was handed a six-year prison sentence and a prospective lifetime ban from holding public office in the Vialidad case in which she was found guilty of fraudulently awarding public works contracts during her terms as president. She is still legally allowed to run for office until all instances of appeal have been exhausted.  “The conviction and ban, in this case, has only one political and electoral translation: a political ban.”  Kirchner contends in the letter that the Supreme Court is purposefully persecuting Peronism, dubbing it the “Judicial Party.” She drew parallels between her potential candidacy and the recent fallout over the Court suspending elections in San Juan and Tucumán.  “Just as three people [the justices of the Supreme Court] did it with the provinces of Tucumán and San Juan,” she said. “I have no doubt that they will do it against me in order to prevent Peronism from participating in the democratic process, or to weaken it, leading us to a dead end.”  Last week, the Supreme Court published preliminary rulings which declared the ineligibility of Tucumán and San Juan’s governors to run for reelection, suspending the provincial elections via precautionary measures in response to complaints filed by the opposition.  You may also be interested in: Supreme Court lifts Tucumán election suspension  Kirchner also said in the letter that since 2016, the so-called “Judicial Party […] works as a task force for Juntos por el Cambio [the main opposition coalition].” She also accused the Clarín newspaper of being “the main source for spreading hatred towards me and my family,” of lamenting the failed assassination attempt against her, and of anticipating the Vialidad case ruling.  “We must be intelligent in order to get out of this labyrinth and break the trap into which they want to lead us: that we have a candidacy forbidden by the Judicial Party,” she wrote.  Kirchner also deemed it “essential” to draw up a “government program that will enamor Argentine men and women again and convince them that a better country is not only possible but also desirable. A government program that is necessary not only for Peronism but for the democratic system as a whole.”  She also spoke about the country’s economic turmoil –including the “bimonetary” nature of the economy, record-high inflation, and exchange runs against the peso-, and the role of the International Monetary Fund (IMF.)  “This makes it impossible for any government to reasonably manage the natural distributive struggle for income and turns inflation into the most phenomenal instrument for the transfer of resources from society as a whole to the richest and most concentrated sectors of the economy,” she wrote.  “It is no coincidence that neither of the two Presidents who accepted the IMF program [referring to former President Mauricio Macri and incumbent Alberto Fernández] retains electoral aptitude,” she added, referring to her own political partner.  The current government and the IMF signed an Extended Fund Facility agreement in 2022 after renegotiating the US$44 billion debt former President Mauricio Macri acquired in 2018. The deal includes an economic program that Argentina must comply with in order to receive disbursements every three months, which are used to pay for the previous debt with the IMF.  Kirchner also said that “democracy lost in the economic arena, it degraded itself in social matters, and started to break down politically and institutionally.”  “An important part of the citizenship does not feel that democracy contains themselves or their aspirations,” she wrote.  — Reporting by Facu Iglesia and Valen Iricibar","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vYnVlbm9zYWlyZXNoZXJhbGQuY29tL3BvbGl0aWNzL2luLWNoYXJnZWQtbGV0dGVyLWNmay1zYXlzLXNoZS13aWxsLW5vdC1ydW4tZm9yLWFueS1jYW5kaWRhY3nSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2023-05-16","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 08:12:28","WWE Night of Champions is scheduled for May 27, 2023, at the Jeddah Super Dome in Saudi Arabia. The event has been revived after almost eight years and will be the company's latest event in Saudi Arabia. The previous Night of Champions was held on September 20, 2015, at Toyota Center in Houston, Texas.  Speaking of events in Saudi Arabia, it so happens that certain WWE Superstars have decided to forgo a good payday by refusing to perform at events that happen in the country. On the other hand, certain superstars weren't allowed to perform in Saudi.  Here is the list of WWE Superstars who refused or weren't allowed to perform in Saudi Arabia:  #5. John Cena (Refused)  When WWE signed a ten-year contract with Saudi Arabia in 2018, it was the beginning of ensuring the product was being broadcasted to a global audience. To promote the new relationship, the event featured a singles tournament. In that tournament, one of the advertised superstars was John Cena.  However, when Bobby Lashley was announced as Cena's replacement, it raised eyebrows, given The All Mighty never qualified in the first place. Turns out, The Champ had refused to be a part of the 2018 Crown Jewel in Saudi Arabia as a result of former Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi's alleged assassination.  During the time when Cena refused to perform in Saudi Arabia, he was one of the most heavily advertised superstars for the event.  #4. Sami Zayn (Wasn't allowed)  The current Undisputed WWE Tag Team Champion has never performed in Saudi Arabia. It so happens that Sami Zayn is of Syrian descent, and the relations between Syria and Saudi Arabia used to be in a state of constant unrest.  While speaking on Blindboy podcast in 2020, Zayn discussed his stance on the company's partnership with Saudi Arabia.  ""WWE did a thing, a partnership sort of or signed some sort of deal to put on these shows in Saudi Arabia for I don’t know, what, 10 years or something like that. And I just wasn’t invited to go and I never really dug into it too much because I wasn’t keen on going to begin with, but I would like to discuss that”  However, recent improvements in Saudi Arabia and Syria's diplomatic relations may have convinced the company to include Sami Zayn in the event. Since he is one of the most over superstars among fans, his inclusion should fetch positive results for WWE.  #3. Kevin Owens (Refused)  The current Undisputed WWE Tag Team Champion has previously refused to perform in Saudi Arabia, even though he is scheduled for Night of Champions on May 27, 2023.  It's well-known that Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn are extremely close friends and have been together since their time in the independent wrestling circuit. Therefore, Owens refused to work in Saudi Arabia as a gesture of support towards Sami Zayn, who was not allowed (or never asked) to perform at previous events in Saudi Arabia.  However, Kevin Owens' stance may have changed, given Roman Reigns and Solo Sikoa are supposed to battle Zayn and him at Night of Champions for the Undisputed Tag Team Title. Owens' decision to perform at Night of Champions could be attributed to WWE, including Sami Zayn.  #2. Aleister Black (Wasn't allowed)  Former WWE Superstar Aleister Black did not perform or rather wasn't allowed to perform in Saudi Arabia because of his tattoos that are related to religion.  Black has tattoos that portray Lilith, the demonic figure who stole babies at night, and Yama. Given that Saudi Arabia's stance on religion is rather strict, Black's tattoos will not go down well with the country.  As a result, the promotion never showed any major interest in booking him for Saudi Arabia events, regardless of his talents.  #1. Daniel Bryan (Refused) to work WWE Night of Champions  Former WWE Superstar Daniel Bryan has refused to perform in Saudi Arabia for more than one reason.  Bryan did not want to be a part of Crown Jewel in 2018 because of the same reason as John Cena, i.e., due to the alleged assassination of former Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Furthermore, the inaugural Greatest Royal Rumble event was held on April 27, 2018, in Saudi Arabia, but women weren't allowed to perform. This left a poor impression of Saudi Arabia events in Daniel Bryan's mind.  Finally, another reason why Daniel Bryan refused to perform in Saudi Arabia was due to the country's treatment of the LGBTQ community. In fact, during his time with the company, he directly spoke to Vince McMahon about the situation and his refusal to perform.

The monument was made by the eminent Spanish sculptor Mariano Benlliure (1862-1947), who is known for his neoclassic public monuments in Madrid and elsewhere that make even a clerk like Fergusson into a heroic figure.  It is a reunion of sorts to have this Benlliure work in the National Museum because the Spanish sculptor met a number of Filipino artists who were affiliated with the Spanish Academy in Rome like Juan Luna, Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo and Miguel Zaragoza.  The monument has been loaned by the US Embassy to the National Museum, and it now stands in the main hall of the National Gallery of Art— between Juan Luna’s iconic “Spoliarium” and Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo’s equally violent “Assassination of Governor Bustamante,” previously known under the more controversial title “La iglesia contra el estado”  The extension will last through 2025. The previous agreement expired last year.  Meanwhile, US Ambassador Marykay Carlson said that the state visit to the US by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. was a successful one.  “President Marcos had a series of really important engagements and i think coming out of the visit I think US-Philippines (relations) catapulted up to an even better level than before which was even harder to imagine because we are already in a great trajectory. But he had great engagements with members of our cabinet of course in the Oval Office with the President, the Vice President,” Carlson said.

"assassination","2023-02-12","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 13:30:00","The National Portrait Gallery in February unveiled a rare portrait of President Abraham Lincoln. The nine-foot-tall portrait, painted by W.F.K. Travers in 1865, is one of only three known full-length renderings of the 16th president and will be on loan to the Smithsonian gallery in Washington, D.C., for the next five years.  The painting, which hung for decades in a municipal building in a small New Jersey town, has been restored and is now part of the “America’s Presidents” gallery.  Lincoln sat for Travers in 1864 and Travers completed the oil painting in Germany shortly after Lincoln’s assassination in April 1865. Travers then sold the painting to an American diplomat living in Frankfurt. In 1876, the painting was displayed at an exposition in Philadelphia, where Mary Todd Lincoln was reportedly, “so overcome by its lifelike appearance that she fainted and was carried out of the hall.”  Rare painting of President Abraham Lincoln. (National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution)  For years, it hung in the U.S. Capitol while Congress considered whether to purchase it, but it was ultimately sold to the Rockefeller family. In the 1930s, Geraldine Rockefeller Dodge—daughter of William Jr. and niece of John D.—built the Hartley Dodge Memorial Building in memory of her deceased son and filled it with art, including the Lincoln portrait.  In 2017, an archivist discovered that a marble bust of Napoleon sitting in the corner of the council room of the Hartley Dodge Memorial Building had been sculpted by Auguste Rodin, prompting the foundation to reassess all of the art in its collection. The loan of the Lincoln portrait to the National Portrait Gallery is part of that reassessment.  In addition to Lincoln’s likeness, the painting is filled with symbols noting the president’s place in history. He stands in front of a bust of George Washington and a rendering of the painting “Washington Crossing the Delaware” by Emanuel Leutze. Lincoln’s hand rests on a bound copy of the Constitution, next to a scroll bearing a draft of the 13th Amendment. Behind the scroll is a small statue of an African American man rising as he pulls the chains from his body.

"assassination","2014-05-15","Not Discerned","{""Gaza"", ""Gaza"", ""GazaStrip""}","Tue 16 May 2023 09:23:54","In a house in the Sheikh Radwan neighborhood of Gaza City there hangs a poster paying tribute to “the martyrs,” as those who die in the conflict with Israel are typically called. The youngest members of the group are distributing the usual dates and coffee with cardamom to people who come to offer their condolences.  On a poster showing the faces of Jamal Khaswan and his son Yousef, there are no emblems of Palestinian militias, and no photos of well-known Palestinian leaders such as Yasser Arafat, Ahmed Yasin or Mohammed Dahlan. Instead, there are only three logos: one from the city’s Al Wafa hospital — where the deceased had served as chairman of the board —, another one from a charitable association and a third from a nursing home.  Khaswan’s relationship with Palestine’s armed groups came down to living in the apartment unit right above Tariq Ibrahim Ezzedin, one of three leaders of Palestinian Islamic Jihad against whose homes Israel’s military aviation launched a missile in a series of synchronized selective assassinations, triggering a new escalation of violence and five days of fighting that ended this past Saturday with a ceasefire after 33 deaths in Gaza and two in Israel.  One of the homes targeted by Israeli aviation in Gaza City. Antonio Pita  It was 2:00 a.m. when the ceiling collapsed on the bed in which Jamal and his wife, Mervat, were sleeping. Both died, as did their 20-year-old son Yousef, who was sleeping in an adjoining room. Another son, Yasem, who is five years younger, did not find out until the next day, at the hospital, that he had lost three members of his family. The youngest child, a nine-year-old girl, still believes that her parents and one of her brothers “are traveling,” explains Musa Saber Khaswan, Jamal’s brother. They are three of the 14 civilians whose lives were claimed by Israel’s Operation Shield and Arrow, defined this Sunday by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as “perfect” for having killed ”dozens of terrorists” — including six leaders of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad — and doing so “with total surprise and continuing initiative.”  “I was sleeping and suddenly things fell on my bed. It took me a few minutes to react,” Yasem, who a visible limp from the injuries caused by the falling debris, explains about the moment the missile hit the house. “We live in Gaza and we know that it is a dangerous place, but we never thought it could happen to us, because we know that my family is not a target for Israel,” he says with an absent look in his eyes.  Jamal Khaswan, 53, was a respected figure in Gaza, says his brother Musa Saber, who is four years older. In the 1990s, he studied dentistry and earned a doctoral degree in Russia, and had dual nationality. He was part of the family business of dental prosthetics, which currently employs 10 people and has been run by Musa since his graduation from Tel Aviv University (back when studying in Israel was not a pipe dream for a resident of Gaza). All the children in the family have gone on to study dentistry at college.  Musa Saber Khaswan stands next to two posters paying tribute to his brother Jamal, one of the victims of Israeli airstrikes against Gaza. Antonio Pita  Musa had visited his brother, who also headed the Gaza Dental Association, shortly before the latter’s death. Two hours later, he received a call that the building had been bombed. “It’s a good neighborhood. No one had moved away, no one expected anything to happen. If everyone in Gaza who has a neighbor from Hamas or from Islamic Jihad had to get out, the Israelis would have to start building lots of apartments for us,” he says ironically in one of the rare moments in which his voice does not tremble. “The pain of losing a brother is impossible to explain, but beyond that, the question is: why did he have to die? And I would say the same if I were a Jew or a Christian. And another question, how long will it go on like this?”  Three goals  The gaping holes in the buildings attest to the accuracy of both the impact (the buildings are still standing and, generally, with a single burnt-out apartment) and of Israel’s intelligence information regarding the location of the targets. The missiles were launched at dawn against three bedrooms in three different houses where the leaders of Palestinian Islamic Jihad were resting with their wives and children. Of the 13 deaths caused by that first wave of selective assassinations, on May 9, there were 10 civilians. One of them was five-year-old Hajar, who had snuggled in with her parents in their bed. Her father was Jalil Bahitini, a top commander of the Islamic Jihad.  Another daughter, 10-year-old Nada, has a black eye. That night, she was sleeping on the couch in the family home, just a few meters from the room where the projectile hit. At first, she says, she thought it was a dream. Then she saw a small fire. “I started screaming and realized that no one could hear me because I was under rubble,” she recalls, standing next to her sister Sara, 14. “I was expecting that something might happen to my father. At first, they told me that he had died, but that my mother and sister were only injured,” says Nada, before a lump in her throat prevents her from speaking further.  “My father used to tell us: ‘I could die at any moment,’” says his son Abdelaziz, 17, who was sleeping on the top floor of the two that make up the family home. “Yes, we were worried about him, because we knew he was part of the resistance and because what he said was true. But we thought it could happen in the middle of the street, or in a training field. What I could not imagine is that they would also take my mother and my sister,” he says, standing under the funeral tent where the Islamic Jihad is honoring his father. A group of hooded armed militiamen, the Al-Quds Brigades, are posing while loudspeakers blast nationalist and religious music against the “Zionist enemy.”  A poster paying tribute to Yihad Shaker Al Ghanam, secretary general of the military council of the Al Quds Brigades, killed on Monday in Israeli airstrikes in Rafah, a city in the south of the Gaza Strip. Antonio Pita  Considered a terrorist group by Israel, the United States and the European Union, the Islamic Jihad — which depends on Iran for weapons and financing — is not very large, but it is particularly combative and Islamist, which is evident in the staging of the tributes to their deceased commanders. There are only men inside the tents, and the dead wives do not typically appear on the posters. The images of their dead leader Tariq Ibrahim Ezzedin extol the warrior in fatigues with the Temple Mount in the background, rather than the father in civilian clothes standing next to his two deceased sons: Ali, eight, and Miar, 12.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL2VuZ2xpc2guZWxwYWlzLmNvbS9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLzIwMjMtMDUtMTYvd2l2ZXMtY2hpbGRyZW4tbmVpZ2hib3JzLXRoZS1vdGhlci12aWN0aW1zLW9mLWlzcmFlbHMtYWlyc3RyaWtlcy1hZ2FpbnN0LW1pbGl0YW50cy1pbi1nYXphLmh0bWzSAaIBaHR0cHM6Ly9lbmdsaXNoLmVscGFpcy5jb20vaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC8yMDIzLTA1LTE2L3dpdmVzLWNoaWxkcmVuLW5laWdoYm9ycy10aGUtb3RoZXItdmljdGltcy1vZi1pc3JhZWxzLWFpcnN0cmlrZXMtYWdhaW5zdC1taWxpdGFudHMtaW4tZ2F6YS5odG1sP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2023-05-01","10:30:00","{""Islamabad"", ""FederalCapitalArea"", ""Pakistan""}","Tue 16 May 2023 08:58:44","Islamabad:  Pakistan witnessed one of its worst violence, clashes and chaos on May 9 following former Prime Minister Imran Khan’s arrest at the Islamabad High Court, which prompted his followers to vandalise and damage sensitive army installations across the country.  The violence that went on for at least 72 hours saw mob attacks on General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, Core Commander house in Lahore, Jinnah House Lahore, Radio Pakistan’s Peshawar office, and other government and state institution offices and buildings across the country.  The chaos targeted at state institutions, and the anger among Imran Khan’s supporters against the military, has now been linked to the former premier’s anti-military stance, open accusation and name calling of senior serving military officials of being behind attempts of assassination on his life.  The Pakistan Army has now decided to show zero tolerance against elements behind these attacks, terming them as a blatant attempt to not only target the institution but also to create a division between the people and the army.  During a special session of the Core Commanders Conference held at GHQ Rawalpindi, Chief of Army Staff General Syed Asim Munir was given a comprehensive briefing about incidents of violence and mob attacks on 9th May onwards as commanders expressed their anguish over the condemnable incidents.  The Core Commanders Conference mutually agreed to not show any restraint if such an attempts like that of 9th May are repeated in the future.  It also decided to show zero tolerance against all culprits behind the attacks, which the armed forces termed as “foreign supported and internally instigated, promoted and provoked against military installations and public/private properties”.  The army, without naming Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and its chief Imran Khan, has hinted towards arresting all of its supporters, instigated and provoked by him, which has lead to the attacks against the military installations, and initiating trial against them under the anti-terrorism laws of the country.  The army has also decided to initiate the Army Act and the Official Secret Act in some cases as well going forward.  It claimed that it has irrefutable evidence to establish that the attacks were part of a pre-planned strategy, implemented immediately after Khan’s arrest.  “The forum was briefed that a well coordinated arson plan involving desecration of Shuhada pictures, monuments, burning down of historical buildings and vandalism of military installations was executed to malign the institution and provoke it towards giving an impulsive reaction,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement.  “These attacks and attempts were made to create distortions in this regard are absolutely futile,” the ISPR added.  It is a known fact that Imran Khan has been very vocal about naming and shaming the army chief as well as other senior serving army and intelligence officials.  In his statement on May 9 before leaving for Islamabad from his Zaman Park residence in Lahore, he had lashed out at the military establishment yet again warning them of being ready for the consequences if any attempts to arrest him are made.  Now, with the army geared up to not spare the narrative and respond it with legal cases, Imran Khan’s coming days may just be numbered and he may be booked and trialed under the same references.  Under any of the references, if a case against Imran Khan is lodged and he is put to trial under any of the Acts, he may face life imprisonment or capital punishment.

"assassination","1969-07-01","Not Discerned","{""Brazil"", ""Indiana"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 12:59:50","When Robert Garland becomes artistic director of Dance Theatre of Harlem on July 1, he follows in the footsteps of founder Arthur Mitchell and retiring artistic director Virginia Johnson. He’s stepping into an important role: In addition to being a leading classical company that’s toured worldwide, DTH has had a significant impact on the field of dance and the larger American cultural landscape.  Arthur Mitchell created Dance Theatre of Harlem in New York City in 1969. Mitchell had made history as the first Black principal dancer at New York City Ballet, where he danced from 1956–69, with Balanchine creating ballets on him, notably roles in Agon and A Midsummer Night’s Dream. When Mitchell heard of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on the radio while in Brazil in 1968, he decided to return home to start a dance school in Harlem. He enlisted the mentorship of Balanchine and the partnership of dance teacher Karel Shook.  Mitchell started the DTH School in a converted garage in Harlem, followed by the touring company, of which Virginia Johnson was a founding member. Mitchell created a haven for dancers of all colors who craved training, performance experience, and an opportunity to excel in classical ballet.  Though DTH began touring in 1969, it had its official New York City debut in 1971 at the Guggenheim Museum, with chamber ballets choreographed by Mitchell. With Mitchell’s­ vision,­ the guidance of Balanchine, who gave Mitchell­ access­ and rights to perform his ballets, and the partnership of Shook, the foundation of the company was laid. In addition to commis­sion­ing works from Black choreographers (he named Robert Garland as DTH’s first resident choreographer in 1995), Mitchell­ updated classical ballets, such as with Creole Giselle, staged by Frederic Franklin and set in 19th-century­ Louisiana, and John Taras’ Firebird, set in a lush jungle.  In its more than 50-year history, DTH has received international acclaim, performing in 44 states, 250 cities in North America, and in 40 countries on 6 continents. DTH’s pioneering efforts to integrate stages and spread the art of ballet through outreach programs at home and abroad made it a beacon for Black dancers worldwide. In 2004, the company went on hiatus because of financial challenges, and in 2009, Mitchell asked Johnson to bring the company back. Over the past 13 years, Johnson has led the company’s renaissance.  Watching DTH today, the impact of this trailblazing organization is clear. From its diverse international dancers to the dynamic classical and contemporary repertory, the many stars who began their careers with DTH now dancing in ballet companies around the world, and its reemergence in the global ballet scene, the company reflects today what Johnson exalts as “the prevailing sense of self-affirmation behind DTH” that was integral to Mitchell’s vision.  The impact of Dance Theatre of Harlem extends far beyond the stage. The company represents the amalgamation of culture present in evolving art forms and what it looks like when the reality of a diverse country is in fact exalted in its most expressive art form. Art, like that of DTH, is indeed the resistance to the facade of elitism representing only a portion of the population and culture. As Virginia Johnson passes the torch to Robert Garland to become the third artistic director in the company’s 54-year history, she leaves the organization poised to expand upon Arthur Mitchell’s extraordinary vision.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhbmNlbWFnYXppbmUuY29tL2RhbmNlLXRoZWF0cmUtb2YtaGFybGVtLWltcGFjdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The bird was found dead on Monday, May 8 on the promenade by a little girl sucking on a lollipop. The pellet holes in its head indicate that the bird was caught in a triangulated crossfire between three assassins, much like President John F Kennedy, who was murdered in similar fashion near the grassy knoll in Dallas on 22nd November 1963.  Quite why the seagull was targeted is unsure but it is not believed to be connected with the bird’s policies on the invasion of Cuba or its secret negotiations with Russia’s president Nikita Krushchev.

"assassination","2023-03-01","Not Discerned","{""London"", ""GreaterLondon"", ""UnitedKingdom""}","Tue 16 May 2023 11:27:58","LONDON -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pressed the British government at the end of a whirlwind European tour Monday to join a ""fighter jet coalition"" that would help strengthen his country's aerial capabilities, but instead secured a commitment for attack drones and hundreds more missiles.  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak greeted Zelenskyy with a handshake and hug after the president's helicopter landed at Chequers, the British leader's official country retreat. It was Zelenskyy's second trip to the U.K. since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, and the fifth European country he's visited in three days.  He is seeking more military aid as Ukraine prepares a long-anticipated spring offensive to retake Russian-occupied territory. The Ukrainian leader also visited Italy, the Vatican, Germany and France.  Russia reacted to the U.K.'s new pledge ""extremely negatively,"" but also doubts that the missiles and drones would drastically change the course of the war, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday.  ""Britain aspires to be at the forefront among countries that continue to pump weapons into Ukraine,"" Peskov said. ""We repeat once again: It cannot yield any drastic and fundamental influence on the way the special military operation (in Ukraine) is unfolding. But definitely it leads to further destruction. ... It makes this whole story for Ukraine much more complicated.""  Zelenskyy said one of the missions of his European travels that started Saturday was to build a ""fighter jet coalition"" to provide Ukraine with vital military power in the air. He said more work was needed on that front.  While the U.K. will not provide the planes, the prime minister said the country would join the coalition and begin a previously announced training program for Ukrainian fighter pilots as soon as this summer.  The U.K., one of Ukraine's major military allies, has provided short-range missiles, Challenger tanks and trained 15,000 Ukrainian troops on British soil. Last week, the government announced it had sent Ukraine Storm Shadow cruise missiles, which have a range of more than 150 miles. The British missiles were the first known shipment of longer-range weaponry that Kyiv has long sought from its allies.  Sunak's office said it was giving Ukraine hundreds more air defense missiles, as well as ""long-range attack drones"" with a reach of more than 120 miles.  ""This is a crucial moment in Ukraine's resistance to a terrible war of aggression they did not choose or provoke,"" Sunak said. ""They need the sustained support of the international community to defend against the barrage of unrelenting and indiscriminate attacks that have been their daily reality for over a year.  ""We must not let them down,"" the prime minister added.  Sunak plans to push allies at a meeting of the Group of Seven leaders in Japan later this week to deliver more support to Ukraine, his representative said.  As Zelenskyy visited European capitals, Russia increased its attacks across Ukraine with drones and missiles. Russia shelled two communities Sunday in the northern border province of Sumy, regional officials said on Telegram. They said 109 explosions were recorded.  Zelenskyy's office said Monday that Russian attacks had killed nine civilians and injured 19 in the past day. Six of the deaths were in southern Ukraine's Kherson province. Two civilians were killed in Chuhuiv in Kharkiv province, and one in Prymorsk, on the Azov Sea coast about 12 miles from Russian-occupied Berdyansk.  The presidential office also reported that Marhanets, which lies across the river from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, was shelled.  Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti reported that an acting regional interior minister appointed by Moscow, Igor Kornet, was injured in an explosion at a barbershop in the Russian-occupied city of Luhansk. The leader of the Luhansk People's Republic, a separatist-held region of Ukraine that Moscow illegally annexed, was quoted as saying a bomb caused the explosion.  Assassination attempts and sabotage attacks have increased in Russian-occupied territory as well as Russia proper. Russian authorities often blame Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv rarely acknowledges such attacks.  Zelenskyy traveled to Britain from Paris, where he met Sunday with French President Emmanuel Macron and secured a pledge of light tanks, armored vehicles and air defense systems.      About 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers will receive training in France this year and nearly 4,000 others in Poland, Macron's office said.  Speaking Monday on the French television network TF1, Macron said training on French fighter jets such as the Mirage 2000 ""can start now"" but rejected the idea of France delivering warplanes to Ukraine.  Zelenskyy also met with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Sunday. It was his first visit to Berlin since the start of the invasion and came a day after the German government announced military aid for Ukraine worth more than $3 billion.  Modern Western hardware is considered crucial if Ukraine is to succeed in its planned counteroffensive. During his European trip, Zelenskyy said Ukraine would aim to liberate Russian-occupied areas within Ukraine's internationally recognized borders and would not attack Russian territory.  Among areas Russia still occupies are the Crimean Peninsula and parts of eastern Ukraine with mainly Russian-speaking populations.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm53YW9ubGluZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzL21heS8xNi96ZWxlbnNreXktcHVzaGVzLWZvci1maWdodGVyLWpldC1jb2FsaXRpb24vP25ld3Mtd29ybGTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2023-05-18","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 16:13:05","Hey everybody,  Today is the feast of St. Simon Stock, the 13th-century Carmelite who, by tradition, received from the Blessed Virgin the brown scapular which forms part of the Carmelite habit, and which — in smaller form — is worn daily by non-Carmelite Catholics around the world (including me!).  The scapular represents the filial piety of Catholics who have entrusted themselves to the protection of Our Lady — it is a sign of receiving Mary as a mother, and asking for her intercessory prayers.  It became a popular devotion beyond the Carmelites in the 16th and 17th centuries, and remains one today — and it probably helped that Pope John Paul was devoted to the scapular sacramental, reportedly asking in 1981, after an assassination attempt, that doctors leave his scapular around his neck while they operated on his body.  Of course, there are people who criticize the scapular as a kind of talismanic devotion — taking the so-called scapular promise (“whoever dies clothed in this scapular shall not suffer the fires of hell”) literalistically, instead of understanding it as a way of talking about persevering in the spiritual life.  It would be a mistake to imagine that one can die very far from God, in a pile of sin and depravity, and be taken up to heaven because one has worn the right wool squares around one’s neck. But I don’t know too many people who actually think that’s what their scapular is about.  Taken properly, as a sign of consecration to Christ through the maternal intercession of the Blessed Mother, the scapular can be a physical sign of the way in which, as John Paul II put it, “devotion to [Mary] cannot be limited to prayers and tributes in her honor on certain occasions, but must become a ‘habit,’ that is, a permanent orientation of one's own Christian conduct, woven of prayer and interior life, through frequent reception of the sacraments and the concrete practice of the spiritual and corporal works of mercy.”  JPII added: “In this way the scapular becomes a sign of the ‘covenant’ and reciprocal communion between Mary and the faithful: indeed, it concretely translates the gift of his Mother, which Jesus gave on the Cross to John and, through him, to all of us, and the entrustment of the beloved Apostle and of us to her, who became our spiritual mother.""  Whether you’re a scapular wearer or not, let the feast of St. Simon Stock remind us to make our devotion to Mary a “habit,” a “permanent orientation of … Christian conduct,” through the sacraments and the works of mercy.  St. Simon Stock, pray for us.  Subscribe now  The news  The bishops of France announced May 5 a kind of clerical ID card for bishops, priests, and deacons in the country, which replaces the customary celebret, and which includes a QR code, linking to a website which gives (reportedly) updated information on whether the cleric has faculties, and whether he labors under any ecclesiastical sanctions or ministerial restrictions.  Bishop Jean-Marc Eychenne of Grenoble-Vienne, France, shows his identity card. Screenshot from Église catholique en France YouTube account.  The ID card system has gotten some pushback in France, with some victim advocacy groups calling it a publicity stunt, and saying that it’s been rolled out in place of more systematic safeguarding policies needed in France.  I don’t know about all that.  But I do know that in the U.S., there exists a cumbersome, time-consuming, and expensive (in terms of personnel) back-and-forth process between dioceses for checking to see whether a cleric is a priest in good standing, who has faculties, and who has completed the safe environment trainings and background checks required for ministry.  When priests go out of town for weddings, retreats, vacations, or to fill in for a friend, there is a lot of paperwork going on between curias to make sure things are in order. A digitized system that would simplify that process would save priests a lot of headaches, and save chanceries a lot of time and money.  Of course, much like the current “letter of suitability” system, the digital ID card system is only as good as its users — if chanceries weren’t honest about a priest’s status, the card system wouldn’t fix that. And if chanceries didn’t update statuses in their databases, well, the card system wouldn’t be especially useful. But there are “user error” problems with the current approach as well, and sometimes they’re caused by the sheer volume of letters being handled in a vicar for clergy’s office — a volume that would be considerably reduced by this system.  It would be foolish to think that this system could replace other needed safeguarding reforms — as the victims’ advocates in France pointed out. But while it can’t solve all problems, it could solve some problems — and I know a lot of clerics hoping the bishops of the U.S. will take up a similar system soon.  Read all about France’s efforts, right here.  —  While the German “synodal way” formally concluded back in March, the powerful lay Central Committee of German Catholics says its battle to change the Church in Germany is just getting started.  “We are witnessing in recent weeks a Church in which leading men are cementing their power, refusing developments, and further deepening the rifts between the Church and the world,” the Zdk’s Irme Stetter-Karp said earlier this month, complaining about the Vatican’s refusal to endorse a resolution calling for lay preaching at Masses.  “I am angry and shocked,” Stetter-Karp declared. “But today more than ever it is clear: This Church as an absolutist system of power must come to an end.”  In an analysis last week, Luke Coppen broke down the ZdK’s efforts to obtain a permanent share of decision-making power within the Catholic Church in Germany — and its escalation of confrontational rhetoric after the Vatican didn’t endorse synodal way proposals.  Interesting, of course, is that German bishops have to date seemed to fall into line with whatever Stetter-Karp pushes for in Germany. But as they’re forced into a corner, it’s not clear they’ll continue “accompanying” the ZdK — and their pushback would mark a major sea change for ecclesiastical dynamics in Germany.  Read all about that, right here.  —  The Vatican City State got on a Saturday a new constitution, promulgated by Pope Francis, and making a number of interesting reforms. Most headlines about the new law have focused on the fact that lay people can now serve on the city-state's governing commission.  But most striking at The Pillar is that the new constitution talks about the exercise of authority in a very unusual way — removing all references to ordinary governance power, and focusing on governance “functions,” exercised in cooperation with the pontiff.  That might seem like pedantic semantics.  But amid a major Vatican debate about lay people and the “power of governance” in the Church, this revised rhetoric in the fundamental law of Vatican City is a big deal. But — what exactly does it mean?  In an incisive analysis, Ed Condon breaks things down. And he says it may be too soon to tell what the Vatican is working at here — but it’s something worth noting.  Read about a big, and cryptic, change, coming amid a ferocious debate about holy orders and governance.  —  Pope Francis has told journalists in recent months that he’s hoping to go to his native Argentina next year.  In 10 years of papacy, the pontiff has not yet been home to his country — and the reasons why are pretty complicated, actually. And, in fact, 2024 isn’t chosen at random: there’s a pretty good set of reasons why that might be the most sensible year for the pope to return home.  But to understand much of that, you’ve got to understand something about Argentine politics, and the pope’s long-standing tensions with various politicians, of various parties.  So our Latin American correspondent, Edgar Beltran, took a very deep dive into some of Francis’ history in Argentina — talking with a number of experts on the subject — to explain why the pontiff has delayed his homecoming.  This is a history of Francis with which you might not be especially familiar. And you should read it, because you’ll probably learn something. I learned a lot.  Give a gift subscription  —  We reported on Friday that the Vatican will ask Bishop Rick Stika to resign as Bishop of Knoxville, after more than two years of scandal over the bishop’s leadership of his eastern Tennessee diocese.  Sources close to the Dicastery for Bishops confirmed that Pope Francis decided last month to request Stika’s resignation, after reviewing the results of a Vatican-ordered investigation into the bishop’s management.  Of course, the Knoxville diocese has not commented on our reporting, and it remains to be seen whether Stika will actually tender his resignation. If he doesn’t, it could take some time for a difficult situation in Tennessee to resolve. But our reporting indicates that a long saga in the diocese is coming to its end game.  My suspicion is that Bishop Mark Spalding of Nashville will be appointed to temporarily lead the diocese if, and when, Stika makes his exit.  Things aren’t over in Knoxville, but this is a very serious development in a story we’ve covered now for more than two years.  And, if you’ve forgotten how exactly it started, you can read our lengthy May 2021 profile of Stika — which gives a rather comprehensive view of the man himself, even while we’ve uncovered considerably more about his leadership since its publication.  Leave a comment  Did +Strickland do a schism?  Bishop Joseph Strickland of Tyler, Texas, attracted some attention this weekend, when on Friday night he tweeted that “I believe Pope Francis is the Pope but it is time for me to say that I reject his program of undermining the Deposit of Faith.”  There is a backstory to the tweet, which involves Strickland signing on to participate as a lecturer in a kind of online course organized by a sedevacantist named Patrick Coffin, and then pulling out once he learned it was a sedevacantist affair.  But the backstory isn’t important right now, or at all, actually.  To many people, though, it does seem important that a sitting diocesan bishop accused the pope of advancing a “program undermining the Deposit of Faith.”  The “deposit of faith” constitutes the whole of sacred revelation, as contained in Sacred Scripture and Sacred Tradition, to be interpreted by the Church’s magisterium — so it’s no small potatoes for a sitting diocesan bishop to say the pope opposes that sacred deposit.  I was reminded by the tweet, to be honest, of some of the more fiery columns written decades ago by Milwaukee’s Archbishop Rembert Weakland in opposition to Pope St. John Paul II’s Curia, with whom Weakland disagreed on just about everything.  I don’t think +Strickland would appreciate being compared to +Weakland, but I can’t think of another American bishop who has so openly and directly expressed such vehement opposition to a pope’s leadership in a public context.  Now, let’s be real for a minute, OK? Really real.  There are a lot of Catholics, bishops among them, who think that Pope Francis’ approach to governance and teaching in the life of the Church is counterproductive, theologically flawed, or inimical to the flourishing of the Gospel. There were a lot of Catholics, bishops among them, who thought that about JPII or Benedict XVI’s leadership, or about that of Paul VI and John XXIII before them.  The pope is a sign and agent of unity in the Church, but he fosters that unity through faith, sacraments, and governance, not his own personal priorities or opinions.  This is a big Church, and we’re not all going to agree — so it shouldn’t be a source of scandal that some bishops think the Church’s pastoral life should be going in a very different direction than the pope is taking it. Especially in the modern era, when the personality of the pope looms so large, and seems to shape an office which once dwarfed its occupants, it can hardly be a surprise that a cadre of bishops disagree with the rhetoric, policies, or priorities of the Roman Pontiff. There’s no sin in that, so far as I can tell.  And there are probably a fair number of bishops today who basically agree with what Strickland had to say, even if they think he said it inelegantly, at best.  But a bishop has the responsibility of both leading his own people, and of building up unity in the life of the entire Church — of encouraging filial piety toward the pope as a universal shepherd and the principle of unity, and of encouraging obedience to him.  A bishop also has a responsibility to assure Catholics of the unique charism of the pope to teach, and of the Lord’s promise to protect the Church from error or apostasy, even if not to protect the Church from the imprudent choices of her leaders, or of the consequences of those choices.  While Strickland didn’t expressly encourage disobedience to the pope, you’d be hard-pressed to argue that language about “rejecting” and “undermining” is going to help Catholics who feel discouraged or confused at the moment to find their footing — or remind them about the charismatic infallibility of the papacy which acts as a kind of safeguard for the deposit of faith itself.  In that sense, it is a scandal if a sitting diocesan bishop made it harder for Catholics to find the proper disposition at a difficult moment in the Church’s life, or if he enflamed the passions of Catholics, undermining their ability to accept the primacy of the pope as an article of both faith and practice.  Now, the bishop might say there’s a reason for his rhetoric. I asked him for an interview on Monday to explain himself, but he declined to give that interview — so we’re left without his elaboration.  I have noted before that Strickland seems to speak before he thinks at crucial moments, and that while he’s sometimes revered as a straight-shooting hero, there are consequences to that kind of thing, and they often lead to confusion.  Still, while I’ve seen commentators and reporters suggest that Strickland’s tweet on Friday constitutes a kind of schism, I don’t think that’s so.  Schism is the “refusal of submission to the Roman Pontiff, or of communion with the members of the Church subject to him.”  It generally means a formal act of rejection - excluding the pontiff from the Eucharistic prayer, for example - or an act of disobedience to an actual directive from the pope. So while people might argue Strickland is in the proximate occasion of schism, I can’t see how he’s actually committed the canonical crime.  There is another canonical crime, though, that might be applied to Strickland’s rhetoric:  Canon 1373 establishes that “a person who publicly incites hatred or animosity against the Apostolic See or the Ordinary because of some act of ecclesiastical office or duty, or who provokes disobedience against them, is to be punished by interdict or other just penalties.”  It could be plausibly argued, I think, that Strickland’s tweet might well provoke disobedience against the Apostolic See, given that it talks about a kind of rejection of the pope’s leadership — or suggests as much.  We discussed c. 1373 at The Pillar yesterday, with Ed of the opinion that the Holy See might very well sanction Strickland, in light of the canon, for the scandal of his tweet.  Ed argued that bishops have been removed for less — pointing out that the bishop of Arecibo, Puerto Rico, was removed from his office last year for, effectively, some disagreements with his brother Puerto Rican bishops.  But that bishop was reportedly removed after considerable lobbying by influential churchmen who didn’t like his influence on the Church in Puerto Rico. And I don’t think the Holy See will have much response to Strickland’s tweet.  In the first place, the Vatican is still enough of the old school that while a magazine or journal article might rank as important, a tweet seems to many officials like some ephemeral bit of noise on the internet, unimportant, because it’s not understood.  But more than that, Pope Francis’ approach to overt criticisms of his leadership — whether from left, right, or center, is to ignore them — to deprive his critics of the oxygen they’d gain from his attention. Whether a particular criticism is valid or not is immaterial to him — the pope has demonstrated that he prefers to freeze out his critics, as he’s done in Germany, rather than respond with defenses or overt sanctions.  While I am certain the Holy See will make life difficult for the bishop of Tyler, by a thousand kinds of administrative and bureaucratic coldness, I think Strickland was probably already on the list for that kind of treatment in Rome.  Furthermore, I don’t think there’s anyone to lobby for his removal, or for any kind of sanction against him, for that matter.  If the American churchmen influential in Rome are asked their opinions, I suspect they’ll say they see Strickland’s rhetoric as a problem. But I don’t think they’ll stick their necks out too far over the issue.  I suspect those influential American churchmen in Rome realize they only have so much political capital for these kinds of things, and they don’t perceive Strickland as a major obstacle to achieving their goals for the life of the Church.  They might be bothered by his impertinence, sure, but I don’t think anyone in ecclesiastical leadership takes him seriously enough to push to get this on the pontiff’s desk.  In the Church, there is a certain kind of latitude extended to people perceived as harmless-seeming zealots, especially if they lack very much influence on their brother bishops. I suspect that’s how Strickland will be perceived in Rome, unless American cardinals push the issue.  In short, I’ll be very surprised if the pope makes any move regarding Strickland.  Again, I’m not saying I’ve got an opinion on what should be done about him — I know I’ll soon get emails about why my opinion is wrong on Strickland — it’s just my read of the situation itself.  Marshall Matters  In a surprise move last week, Catholic YouTube celebrity and internet provocateur Taylor Marshall announced that he was running for president.  Of the United States of America.  Now, in our little corner of the world, Marshall is not an unknown commodity. The guy has some half-a-million subscribers on YouTube, wrote a book hypothesizing about various infiltrations of the Vatican, developed a friendship with Archbishop Viganò, and paid the expenses of the guy who threw “the statue” in the River Tiber during the 2019 Amazon Synod.  He’s also the guy who said just a few months ago that the U.S. government is running an elaborate psyop on the American people to distract us from the possibility of demonic extraterrestrial aliens — or something very close to that.  Marshall is a former Anglican curate who became a Catholic, who once had a little apostolate selling catechetical materials, and whose messaging gradually became more provocative, and less connected to reality, as his YouTube audience grew.  He built an audience while rejecting at various times the legitimacy of the Church hierarchy and Vatican Council II, and, when the moment struck, allied himself with the political conspiracy theorism and biblically apocalyptic rhetoric surrounding the “Stop the Steal” movement.  He is, to my mind, best understood as a kind of religious entertainer, a performance artist, floating often outlandish conspiracy theories and provocative opinions, while managing to connect, in some down-to-earth way, to the real neuralgia about Church and state experienced by a real-life swath of Catholics.  He’s not unlike alt-right polemicist and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, actually — and as it happens, Marshall’s been interviewed as a Vatican “expert” on Jones’ Infowars.  If you’re not down with that kind of thing, let me say Marshall shouldn’t be written off entirely, because, the fact is, he has an audience, and makes a very nice living giving hot takes on the Church, selling books about freemasons and invented conspiracy theories, and portending some coming doom for America and the Church.  It is easy to make fun of Marshall’s schtick. But I think his audience deserves more careful consideration. They matter to me. They’re people who practice the faith, and have concerns and anxieties — people who went looking to make sense of things, and found this dude on YouTube promising he’s got all the answers.  That audience, by the way, exists in real life — when I speak at parishes, seminaries, or diocesan events, I’m often asked what I think of Marshall’s book, or encouraged to check out his YouTube channel — and often enough, by clerics.  And I promise you — this week we’ll see canceled subscriptions, and we’ll get nasty emails, from people who think I fail to appreciate Marshall’s prophetic genius.  While I don’t think Marshall evinces a firm or cogent grasp on issues in the Church, or talks about them sincerely or responsibly, his popularity says something about the unease many Catholics feel about the state of the Church, and about their place in a rapidly changing world — “not an epoch of change,” Pope Francis says, “but a change of epoch.”  And in a certain way, Marshall’s place in the U.S. Church is not all that unlike that of Fr. James Martin — and the popularity of both of those men is instructive.  Like Fr. Martin, the fact that Marshall has a (big) audience tells us some important things about what different swathes of Catholics value, what they fear, and what they’re looking for — even if both men take advantage of that audience, or exploit it to pursue their own (radically different) agendas.  Marshall’s popularity, like Martin’s, strikes me as a kind of funhouse mirror, through which something can be gleaned — with enough filters to straighten the image — about the state of the Church. And it seems to me we should be willing to look.  In fact, if we really want to learn what disenfranchised Catholics think about the Church, we might learn more from the comments in Taylor Marshall’s YouTube videos than we can from all the synods on synodality that every synoded synodally.  And I, for one, think that’s useful.  But Taylor Marshall is not a known commodity outside our small corner of the world.  And let’s just be clear about something.  Taylor Marshall is not going to be the president.  Taylor Marshall will not be president.  He won’t be.  I’m pretty sure that he doesn’t even want to be president.  With that out of the way, I should say that I’m an admirer of third parties and the role they play in American political life, and I think it can be perfectly legitimate to vote for them. I think democracies are healthier without a duopoly locked in enduring combat, when small parties can play key roles in forming coalition governments, and when new ideas have room to move forward.  I think the Democrats and Republicans have done well enough in this country at capturing the whole of our political imagination, and the perpetuity of binary power transfers, such that most of us believe there are only two meaningful options for voting.  The guidance of the Church affirms the legitimacy of choosing the candidate who you think would be the best, even if he won’t win — or even of not voting in a particular race. But when election year rolls around, I hear a lot of well-meaning Catholics say that anything but a vote for Candidate X is really a vote for Candidate Y — or vice versa.  We even hear that from a swath of well-meaning pulpits.  I don’t think the mathematical or moral assessment on that actually checks out, but you hear it in election years, pretty often — “If you don’t vote for Our Guy, you’re voting for the Other Guy. And the Other Guy is pure evil, so you’ve got to vote for Our Guy. And this is the most important election of our lifetime. Again.”  The Church teaches clearly that voting for certain candidates, with inhuman policy agendas, is morally abhorrent, or that one needs rather significant “proportionate reasons” to overcome the monstrosity of their agendas. And it teaches that when all candidates have morally abhorrent agendas, you can choose one who “deemed less likely to advance such a morally flawed position and more likely to pursue other authentic human goods.”  The Church doesn’t teach that if you don’t vote for one of the frontrunners, you’re somehow voting for the other frontrunner. But come election time, you’ll hear a lot of that, with fervent conviction, from lots of Catholics.  And, in fact, in elections past, it was the kind of the thing you’d hear from Marshall’s audience, or from the man himself, as when, for example, he served in 2020 as a prominent member of Catholics for Trump.  So I’m interested to see whether Marshall’s presence as a “candidate” — he is not, as of yet, among the 727 Americans who have filed paperwork with the Federal Elections Commission declaring their candidacy for president — will change that discussion for some Catholics.  Of course, I can’t speculate about why Marshall is running for president. Or, I can, but it wouldn’t be charitable.  But I will say, sincerely, that if the candidacy of a polemicist YouTuber and “Infiltration” expert opens up discussion about breaking free from a consequentialist moral calculus, one mandating people vote for a candidate they just can’t stomach — well, I’m glad for the conversation, at least.  And did you know that 727 Americans have filed paperwork to declare themselves candidates for 2024?  This is one hell of a country, guys.  Subscribe now  It’s not the celibacy  Finally, we covered last week the scandal of Fr. Alfonso Pedrajas, a Spanish Jesuit who served in Bolivia, and whose posthumously discovered journals revealed that he had committed serial abuse of minors, and that his ecclesiastical superiors had seemingly covered it up.  Pedrajas’ journals are sobering and sickening reading, by any standard.  Well, as the Bolivian bishops respond to the scandal, one took to the radio last week, to say that as “changes have to be made,” one of them is for the Church to ordain married men to the priesthood.  According to Bolivian radio network Erbol, Bishop Eugenio Coter argued that allowing married men to be ordained priests could be part of the solution to the problem of sexual abuse in the Church, since, he reportedly argued, marriage helps a person to develop an integrated sexuality, and provides companionship.  Please allow me to editorialize for a moment: Bishop Coter seemingly has rather profoundly misunderstood the dynamics of pederastic and pedophilac child abuse in any context. Marriage would not stop pederastic child abusers from committing abuse. In fact, as data from other public institutions shows us repeatedly, it doesn’t. And indeed, the most typical place for a child to be abused is in his extended family or among family friends, most of whom are not likely celibate.  Of course, I’ve seen it argued that there is a greater likelihood that married men will have a mature, integrated, and chaste sexuality than celibate men. I don’t see any reason to think that’s true — in fact, I don’t think it’s true. But even if it were, allowing for the possibility of married men wouldn’t, by itself, screen out from the priesthood men with the propensity or disposition to be abusers. Better screening, scrutiny, evaluation, and formation processes would do that, with the knowledge that sacred ordination, or admission to religious life, shouldn’t be offered to everyone who seeks it.  It is a demeaning view of marriage — and of women — to suggest that if only priests could be married, abuse would not happen. There is no evidence to suggest this, as experts in abuse and safeguarding have often argued.  Clerical celibacy has a long and rich theological and spiritual history in the West. It is not absolute, of course — deacons can be married men, as can members of the Church’s Anglican ordinariate. But celibacy is a disciplinary, not a doctrinal matter, and the Church could allow for more married men to become priests in the West. Certainly, there are prelates who think that’s a good idea.  But whatever their reasons, the notion that ending clerical celibacy would eradicate abuse is a red herring. At least as far as I can tell — If you think otherwise, let me know in the comments.

The observance will commence on May 29 and conclude on June 10. These programs were finalized during a joint meeting at the party's Naya Paltan central office yesterday, presided over by Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir.  Fakhrul announced a series of activities that will take place during this period. These activities include engaging in discussions, hosting seminars, organizing photo exhibitions, wearing black badges as a symbol of mourning for Zia, as well as distributing food and relief materials to the needy, according to a report by UNB.  As part of the commemoration, black flags will be raised and party flags will be lowered to half-mast at all party offices, including the Nayapaltan headquarters, at 6 am on May 30.  Ziaur Rahman gained prominence for his role in reading out the Declaration of Independence from Kalurghat Betar Kendra on March 27, 1971, and for his active participation in the war. Following liberation, he was appointed deputy chief of staff of the army. After the assassination of the Father of the Nation and President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on August 15, 1975, Zia assumed the position of army chief. In November of the year, following a series of coups and counter-coups, with President ASM Sayem as chief martial law administrator, Zia became one of the three deputy chief martial law administrators. He eventually became president of the country in April 1977 in succession to Justice ASM Sayem, who had become president in early November 1975.  In 1978, Zia founded the BNP and conducted parliamentary elections in 1979 to end martial law rule, which had imposed restrictions on political activities and freedom of the press.  General Zia was assassinated by a group of army officers in a putsch at the Chittagong Circuit House on May 30, 1981, where he had traveled from Dhaka to resolve a conflict within the party.  Following Zia's death, General HM Ershad, who had been appointed army chief by Zia, oversaw the process of a controversial military trial that resulted in the hanging of a dozen army officers on charges of conspiring to assassinate the president. Another courageous army officer, Maj Gen M Abul Manzur, who had knowledge of the conspiracy against Zia, was extrajudicially killed allegedly on Ershad's orders, with him being falsely accused of being behind the president's assassination.  Four days before the assassination, Ershad met with Lt Col Motiur Rahman at the Chittagong cantonment. Motiur shot the president, leading to his demise.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRoYWthdHJpYnVuZS5jb20vYmFuZ2xhZGVzaC8yMDIzLzA1LzE2L2JucC1hbm5vdW5jZXMtemlhcy00Mm5kLWRlYXRoLWFubml2ZXJzYXJ5LXByb2dyYW1z0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

When I announced my decision not to run for office again, I cited the increased vitriol, hateful rhetoric, and lack of civility in our public discourse. It is hard to look at a situation such as today, or reflect on the events of Jan. 6, 2021, and not see some correlation between the divisive politics of hate which depersonalize our political foes into caricatures of villains and the acts of violence.  According to her Congressional Testimony on March 31, 2022, Rachel Kleinfeld, a Senior Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment, there was an acceleration of political violence between 2016 and 2020 and the level of acceptance and support for political violence has also increased by members of both political parties. Justifications are steeped in the importance of protecting the traditional American way of life, validity of elections, and other false or misleading narratives. Threats against members of Congress have almost doubled, and hate crimes are increasing, with rates higher in 2021 than in the year following 9/11.  More disturbing than even historic numbers is the broader base of individuals who are involved in these acts of aggression. Acts of aggression like what happened today at Connolly’s office are no longer contained to extremist groups, but have spread to lone actors reacting to the rhetoric they are hearing or seeing online, in public meetings and feeling compelled to take aggressive action.  We do not know the motivation of the intruder in Connolly’s office. There have been moments and periods of time, as an elected school board member, where I worried about my colleagues, our staff, and my own safety during official proceedings when emotionally charged issues came before the board.  We do know that each of us can do our part to mitigate these acts. Collectively, we must tone down the divisive rhetoric, vilifying name calling, and character assassination. The issues before our Federal, State legislatures, and local governments are too important to trivialize with destructive and non-productive behavior. We must focus on the issues before our policy making bodies that affect the everyday lives of our community members.  We can realize that there are policy areas where groups or individuals may align on individual issues and others where the makeup of a group supporting an issue may be different. However, this is only possible if the discourse focuses on the content of the policy issues and does not cast aspersions on the character of individuals in a group.  Together we can achieve the American dream of a more perfect union by reenforcing our foundations of civil discourse.

"assassination","2023-10-12","Not Discerned","{""PortAuPrince"", ""Ouest"", ""Haiti""}","Tue 16 May 2023 20:00:00","U.N. Secretary General António Guterres warned Monday that Haiti’s “tragic situation” is threatening the security of the Caribbean region and beyond as he pressed the international community for a response.  Guterres spoke after meeting behind closed doors with Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness in his first visit to the island, which comes more than three months after Holness announced that his government was willing to send soldiers and police officers to Haiti as part of a proposed international armed forces deployment.  Guterres noted that no other country has stepped forward despite the plea from Haiti’s prime minister and other top officials last October for the immediate deployment of an international force to fight a surge in gang violence.  “We are kind of in a stalemate right now,” he said, adding that it’s been difficult to mobilize the will of countries who could best lead such an operation.  Holness, who visited Haiti in February as part of a regional push to help mediate the country's crisis, said countries that would support such a deployment want to first see political consensus in Haiti and a timeframe for ending the proposed deployment.  “It is not that our pleas have fallen on deaf ears,” he said. “It is being heard to and listened to. The question is the pace of action.”  Haiti’s capital and surrounding areas have largely succumbed to warring gangs that have invaded neighborhoods and killed people in a fight to control more territory, with the U.N. estimating that they now control up to 80% of Port-au-Prince.  The violence has worsened since the July 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse. More than 840 people were killed in the first three months of this year, in addition to more than 600 people slain in the month of April alone, according to the U.N. More than 400 people also have been kidnapped so far this year.  “You have dramatic humanitarian needs. You have a political system that is paralyzed, and you have levels of violence by gangs that are absolutely appalling,” Guterres said.  He previously said that insecurity in Haiti had reached “levels comparable to countries in armed conflict.”  The deaths have prompted a growing number of angry and frustrated Haitians to unleash gruesome vigilante justice, lynching at least 164 alleged gang members last month, according to the U.N.  Frantz Elbé, director of Haiti’s National Police, said in a video posted on social media Saturday that officers are fighting gangs, seizing weapons and releasing hostages, but he did not provide any figures.  The U.N. has noted that just over 13,000 officers are on active duty in a country of more than 11 million people, with at least 21 police officers reported killed in the first three months of this year.  “I want to once again ask the international community to understand that an effective solidarity with Haiti is not only a matter of generosity,” Guterres said. “It’s essentially a matter of enlightened self-interest because the present situation in Haiti reflects a threat, a threat to the security of the whole region and further afield.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndscm4ub3JnL2FtZXJpY2FzLzIwMjMtMDUtMTYvdW4tY2hpZWYtaW4tamFtYWljYS11cmdlcy1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLXJlc3BvbnNlLXRvLWhhaXRpcy1zcGlyYWxpbmctY3Jpc2lz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2023-04-06","Not Discerned","{""Tennessee"", ""Illinois"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 12:39:47","Tennessee Rep. Justin Jones raises a fist to the legislative gallery, as fellow Rep. Justin Pearson, left, looks on. Seth Herald/Getty Images  Mississippi legislators have enacted a law that would create a new judicial system covering the state’s capital city, Jackson, in place of the current county court system.  Set to take effect July 1, 2023, the move by a Republican-dominated legislature has been criticized by opponents as creating a “separate and unequal” court system that is not answerable to the majority-Black community it would seek to govern.  The law was justified by supporters as an effort to curb the city’s crime level, which includes one of the highest murder rates in the nation. But the move is the second time in as many months that state legislatures have taken highly visible actions to effectively disenfranchise Black voters: On April 6, the Tennessee House of Representatives expelled two Black members who represented mostly Black districts.  As a sociologist who studies race and ethnicity, I have closely followed these moves by the states. Throughout U.S. history, I see three main periods of legislative disenfranchisement in which legislative bodies have voted to expel members. These events have been shown to be a form of “white backlash” working to keep Black officeholders out of power and their constituents powerless without representation.  Reconstruction and legislative disenfranchisement  After the Civil War, the United States engaged in a brief period known as Reconstruction, which lasted from 1865 to 1877. It was a deliberate attempt to reverse the negative effects and legacies of slavery by enacting economic, political and social policies that directly benefited the formerly enslaved Black people of the South.  The efforts included formally abolishing slavery nationwide, guaranteeing equal protection of the laws to everyone regardless of race, and allowing formerly enslaved people to vote. In addition, formerly Confederate land was set aside for newly freed Black families, and former Confederate soldiers were not allowed to vote.  But after Tennessee politician Andrew Johnson, who had been Abraham Lincoln’s running mate in 1864, took office upon Lincoln’s assassination, many of those provisions of Reconstruction were reversed. Former Confederate combatants were allowed to vote, and confiscated Confederate property was returned to its prewar owners.  Story continues  In addition, Johnson and Congress made it easier for defeated Confederate states to rejoin the Union, which allowed former Confederate leaders to regain their previous positions of power in local and national governments.  Georgia was originally readmitted to the Union in July 1868. But just two months later, in September, the Democratically controlled Georgia Assembly, with a total of 196 members, voted to expel all 33 of its Black elected officials.  Immediately upon making themselves into an all-white legislature, the remaining assembly members enacted the infamous Black Codes. These codes created a unique set of laws specific to the newly freed Blacks, including limiting the types of work they could do.  Collectively, the legislative expulsion of the Black officials and the imposition of the Black Codes served to effectively disenfranchise the Black voters of Georgia. Senator Henry McNeal Turner, one of those expelled, defiantly asked: “Am I a man? If I am such, I claim the rights of a man.”  Under the Black Codes, which were restrictive laws in the post-Reconstruction South, a Black person could be sold into what was effectively a new version of slavery if they could not repay fines or debts. Interim Archives/Getty Images  The civil rights era  Another major effort to disenfranchise Black Americans came during their next major push to achieve political, social and economic equality: the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s. Opponents targeted two prominent civil rights activists who had been elected to represent their communities: Adam Clayton Powell Jr. and Julian Bond.  Bond was elected as a Democrat to the Georgia House of Representatives in 1965, but on Jan. 10, 1966, the Democratically controlled House voted not to seat him, citing his criticism of U.S. involvement in Vietnam and support of students who were protesting the war. A year later, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Bond’s First Amendment rights had been violated and ordered that he be seated. But for that intervening year, his constituents had no voice in their state legislature. Bond ultimately served in the Georgia legislature for another two decades, before turning to teaching and activism.  Powell’s situation was different. He was the first African American to be elected to Congress from New York and from any state in the Northeast. Starting in 1945, he represented the district that included the majority-Black Harlem neighborhood of New York City. He became one of the most important Democrats in the House, but in the mid-1960s, he found himself embroiled in personal and financial scandals.  After the election of 1966, the House created a committee to investigate Powell’s actions and refused to seat him until the committee’s report was complete. The report found fault, but committee members were split on the proper discipline for Powell. Ultimately the whole House voted to keep him out.  Powell sued to reclaim his seat, saying the House had excluded him unconstitutionally. He also won the special election in April 1967 created by the vacancy but didn’t take his seat because of the lawsuit. The removal of Powell meant that Harlem was the only congressional district in the nation without a representative from 1967 to 1969.  In 1969, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the House had acted unconstitutionally by refusing to seat Powell. By then, Powell had also won the 1968 regularly scheduled election and had been seated, though without the seniority and committee positions that would normally have been given to someone who had continuously been a House member.  Black Lives Matter movement  In the aftermath of the George Floyd killing, a new social movement emerged across the United States. With this new activism came another “white backlash” in the form of legislative disenfranchisement.  In May 2022, Tiara Young Hudson, a long-serving Black public defender, won the Democratic primary for a judgeship in Jefferson County, Alabama. More than half of the county’s population is nonwhite. Facing no opposition in the general election, she was expected to win and take office.  But two weeks after the primary, a state judicial commission, divided along racial lines, eliminated the position she was a candidate for and created a new judgeship in the majority-white Madison County.  Hudson immediately sued to block the shift, saying it violated the Alabama Constitution and only the state legislature had the authority to reallocate judgeships. In March 2023, the state supreme court dismissed Hudson’s complaint, effectively stripping the Black people of Jefferson County of a representative they had elected to be their voice on the state’s roster of judges.  And on April 6, 2023, the Republican majority of the Tennessee House of Representatives voted to expel two Black legislators – Justin Pearson and Justin Jones – for participating in a protest calling for gun legislation following yet another mass shooting.  Within days, both Pearson and Jones had been temporarily reinstated by processes for filling vacant seats, but still face special elections to fully reclaim their seats. Their alleged violation was participating in a protest against the legislature’s rules – but their real violation, I believe, was that they were Black, outspoken and pushed for change.

The State is churning out statements and proposing ways and means of teaching a lesson to the opposition and its supporters in the public. Taking the cue, much is being written in print and electronic media to further suggest ways to suppress opposition and any dissenting voices, even if they are of the ordinary public. However, beating the drums of war, the politicians are not realizing that their words and actions may later come back to haunt them.  Hundreds of opposition activists have been arrested along with their first and second-tier leadership by the state, which is simply unprecedented in the recent political history of Pakistan. However, would such violent actions of arbitrary arrests, and baton charging, and tear gassing the protestors help to ease the charged atmosphere in the country? Similarly, houses of opposition leaders are being raided, thus setting another dangerous precedent in politics. Also, protesting families are manhandled in front of cameras with impunity, without realizing that local media may be influenced but not the foreign media which is continuously beaming ground realities to the international viewers.  Further, taking the State’s cue and molding public opinion, ideas are being floated in the print and media to repress the opposition—an essential ingredient of democracy. It has been suggested to set up ‘rioter courts’ to punish the rioters, giving the example of the UK, which is the cradle of democracy and citizens’ rights are jealously guarded and the judiciary is independent and impermeable to any influence-hostile or condescending. To try the demonstrators, words like ‘terrorism’ and ‘terrorists’ are being thrown around like spaghetti, and everything is being painted as black or white: you are either with us or against us. In the UK, judges of the ‘rioter courts’ handed sentences for vandalism, theft and arson only upon the provision of solid evidence provided by the law enforcement agencies, not at the whims and egos of a few. Similarly, it is being suggested to conduct trials by army courts. Such undemocratic steps would only weaken the institutions and democracy.  Among the political parties, PPP and its workers have suffered the most for democracy: the execution of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, the assassination of Benazir Bhutto (BB), the incarceration of former Pres Zardari and the flogging of PPP activists. BB was subjected to misogynistic slurs and faced a slew of cases. There are still iconic pictures of BB visiting her incarcerated husband with young children in tow. Therefore, PPP was always at the forefront to save democracy and give space to opposition. However, the torch of leadership has passed to a new generation: which, probably, has neither the experience nor memories of past political victimization, because of this no fire control measures are being initiated by the most mature political party in Pakistan.  There is a general glee over the victimization and abuse of the protesting public. However, keeping in view the political history of Pakistan, what goes around, comes around. Therefore, the petty and brutal tactics might come back to haunt everyone. The egos of a few have put the entire country in a spin and suddenly personal vendettas over the country’s interests have taken center stage. Political parties have probably forgotten the slogan: Democracy is the best revenge. So let sanity and saner minds prevail, lest everybody will lose what was hard won by BB—democracy.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdGlvbi5jb20ucGsvMTctTWF5LTIwMjMvdGhlLWRvZ3Mtb2Ytd2Fy0gFBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmF0aW9uLmNvbS5way8xNy1NYXktMjAyMy90aGUtZG9ncy1vZi13YXI_dmVyc2lvbj1hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

In an interview with Israel's Channel 14, Netanyahu said Israel conveyed a message not only to terror factions in Gaza but also to those in other hostile countries.  “We have changed the deterrence equation,” he said. “I cannot say that we will never return to attacks nor when exactly that will happen, but there is no doubt that we have strengthened Israeli deterrence.”  “We have dealt an extremely powerful blow to the Islamic Jihad and I estimate that this was registered properly,” he continued.  “And it was not only registered with them, it was registered with others.

"assassination","1908-01-30","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 20:30:00","Some visitors to the main hall of the National Museum of Fine Arts are surprised to find an impressive monument of marble and bronze standing between Juan Luna’s “Spoliarium” and Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo’s “Assassination of Governor Bustamante.” If they do not care to act on their surprise by reading the wall texts or asking Google, they will not know that the monument commemorates Arthur Fergusson (1859-1908), an American colonial official whose statue once stood on Plaza Fergusson in front of Ermita Church.  The monument by Spanish sculptor Mariano Benlliure shares space in the hall that celebrates the two greatest Filipino painters of the 19th century because they were classmates at the Spanish Academy in Rome. All three were awarded medals in the 1884 Exposición Nacional de Bellas Artes in Madrid: Luna, First Class or Gold medal for “Spoliarium”; Resurreccion Hidalgo, Second Class or Silver Medal for “Jovenes cristianas expuestas al populacho” (Christian maidens exposed to the mob); Benlliure, Second Class (Silver) medal for “Accidente.”  ADVERTISEMENT  These medals placed Luna and Hidalgo, indios from Filipinas, at par with or even greater than their Spanish peers. They had become world-class. Then as now, we take pride in Luna and Hidalgo in the same way that we share in Lea Salonga’s triumph on the West End and Broadway, Manny Pacquiao’s conquest of world boxing, and, last but not least, weightlifter Hidilyn Diaz bringing home the first Olympic gold to a proud and grateful nation. They made us proud.A photograph taken in Rome, circa 1881, shows Juan Luna, Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo, Miguel Zaragoza, and Pedro Alejandro Paterno with the Benlliure brothers Mariano and Juan of Valencia, Spain. Who would have known these art students would later become famous? Not in the photo is Jose Benlliure who made a copy of Luna’s “Spoliarium” that used to hang in the prewar National Museum before it was destroyed in the 1945 Battle for Manila. The Fergusson monument is one of only three known works by Benlliure in the Philippines today. The other two are a portrait of Juan Luna in the University of Santo Tomas Museum and a portrait of Pedro Paterno in a private collection.  After four months at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, I look at Fergusson differently, in the context of the ongoing revision of museum and library records and catalog entries that situate the past in political correctness. Any and all racist or derogatory language is deleted or reworded. Deirdre de la Cruz and Ricky Punzalan co-direct the Recollect-Reconnect project that seeks to decolonize the University of Michigan Philippine collections to bring out their true worth.  Fergusson was said to have died of a heart attack while walking home from his office in the Ayuntamiento in Intramuros to the suburb of San Miguel on Jan. 30, 1908. As a testament to their loss, Fergusson Memorial Association commissioned the Benlliure monument that was completed in Spain in 1912 and shipped to Manila for its unveiling on Nov. 15, 1913. If you go around the monument, you will find a lot of pockmarks left by bullets and shelling during the 1945 Battle for Manila. My friend Tina Cuyugan related that when her father and uncles were boys, they created a small bomb from toy gun gunpowder and exploded it on the monument one night in 1920. Their homemade bomb is supposed to have blasted away one of Fergusson’s ears. Since Fergusson’s ears are intact, I presume it must have been restored or the boys over-imagined the damage they caused.  The decolonization of Plaza Fergusson came about when the City of Manila commissioned an atrocious image of the Virgin of Ermita (Nuestra Señora de Guia or Our Lady of Guidance) from the late Eduardo Castrillo. The plaza in front of Ermita Church was renamed in her honor. Fergusson was then given to the United States Embassy where it was preserved on the grounds facing Manila Bay until its loan, six years ago, to the National Museum. The plaza was further decolonized by being renamed Plaza Guerrero in honor of the poet Fernando Ma. Guerrero and by extension the other Guerrero writers from Ermita: National Artist Wilfrido Ma., diplomat Leon Ma., and essayist Carmen Guerrero Nakpil. Monuments are erected to boost memory, but when memories are conflicted, monuments with contested histories are removed or relocated just like Fergusson’s.

While the CIDG described Police Staff Sgt. Noel Santa Ana Alabata, Jr. as an alleged hitman of the Teveses, he was arrested using two arrest warrants for cases of attempted murder and attempted homicide issued by two courts in Dumaguete City.  “The accused was formerly assigned to PDEG (Philippine National Police-Drug Enforcement Group) R6 (Region 6) and allegedly used by the Teves as a hitman for a certain ‘Ong’, a rival of the Teves in their business,” the CIDG said quoting its director Police Brig. Gen. Romeo Caramat, Jr.  “Our verification is ongoing on the accused who was tagged as gunman of the Teveses to know if he is involved in other cases. We will be fair on all the information that we would obtain to ensure that justice will prevail,” Caramat added.  The CIDG has been focusing on cases of killings in Negros Oriental following the death of Negros Oriental Gov. Noel Degamo and at least nine others in a daring assassination near his residence in Pamplona town on March 4.  Raids were conducted and cases have been filed against some members of the Teves family in connection with the operations that resulted in the confiscation of cache of firearms.  Negros Oriental 3rd District Rep. Arnie Teves was tagged as among the masterminds in the killing of Degamo but the solon repeatedly denied the allegations. Teves is currently out of the country and is facing expulsion from the House of Representatives.  Alabata was arrested on Tuesday, May 16, in front of the PDEG Building at Camp Crame in Quezon City.

"assassination","1974-01-30","Not Discerned","{""Belfast"", ""Belfast"", ""UnitedKingdom""}","Tue 16 May 2023 11:34:46","A man whose father was killed by loyalist paramilitaries 50 years ago says he has secured the answers his family searched for – from the group which carried out the murder.  John Crawford, a father of nine, was killed in January 1974 at his furniture workshop in west Belfast.  It was unclear for many years who had killed him, with the Official IRA initially blamed as well as false allegations he had been behind two murders.  His son Paul has emphasised the importance of clearing his father’s name both in a Historical Enquiries Team report and an acknowledgement by the UVF that their information had been flawed.  The UVF’s involvement became clear in 1977 when Raymond Glover, a man with UVF connections, confessed his involvement in the killing and was jailed.  The Crawford family went through an inquest, a criminal trial, a Police Ombudsman report and an HET report.  Advertisement  However, Mr Crawford’s son Paul said he secured the answers his family wanted by talking to the UVF via interlocuter Winston Irvine.  The process started in 2016, and Mr Crawford worked with Mr Irvine to ask questions and receive answers as well as verifying what he was told.  One of those questions was around the family’s long-held belief that there had been collusion in the killing.  The report from the UVF said there had not been collusion in terms of there having been no joint enterprise involving other groups or agencies.  However, they said they now accept that the information they acted on was flawed.  'A first' for loyalism  The process, described by Queen’s University academic Professor Kieran McEvoy as “a first” for loyalism, is the subject of a new report.  Professor McEvoy said the closest comparison to the process is the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims’ Remains (ICLVR), through which the IRA and INLA have provided information to help try to find the remains of the ‘disappeared’.  Mr Crawford said the process with the UVF delivered “absolutely full answers and full resolution of what I was seeking”.  “My father was an innocent man who was brutally murdered in a sectarian assassination for which no organisation ever claimed responsibility,” he said.  Advertisement  “My mother Eileen, now deceased, told journalists immediately after the murder in 1974, ‘we want to know who did this and why it should happen to him’. Like many families who lost loved ones, that has remained our quest in the ensuing five decades.”  Paul blasted the original investigation as “poor” and that the brief inquest in 1974 merely confirmed the cause of death.  “One man, James Glover, was convicted in 1978 of the murder after he was arrested for something else and confessed to being involved in my father’s killing and several others.  “However, because he pleaded guilty at trial there was no cross-examination and opportunity to learn anything further,” he said.  “A subsequent Police Ombudsman investigation, during the tenure of Al Hutchinson as ombudsman, was a complete waste of time.  Commissioner for Victims and Survivors Ian Jeffers at Queens University Belfast, following the launch of a report into the murder of John Crawford by the UVF in 1974. Photo: PA Images  “A Historical Enquiries Team report confirmed that my father was an innocent man but that determination was undermined by the fact that one of the original investigating RUC officers was dead and another refused to cooperate.  “After all of these processes, we still had many questions and I concluded that those questions could only be answered by the group responsible, the UVF.  “The process took a long time as it involved agreeing a set of ground rules, with me setting out clearly the information that I was seeking, including that I was not looking for the names of those involved, and then the information being relayed back and forward over many scores of meetings via the interlocutor.  “Ultimately, my family and I received answers to the questions we were seeking and a formal written acknowledgement of responsibility for the murder from the UVF.  “I do not believe in closure – my father was brutally and unjustifiably taken from us and that is a wound that will never heal – but as far as I am concerned this process has delivered absolutely full answers and full resolution of what I was seeking.”  Victims Commissioner Ian Jeffers commended what Mr Crawford has done as “tremendously brave”.  “From my point of view, it shows that with the right tenacity and the right approach you can get information – but the reality is leaving that up to the victim to do seems very, very cruel and that’s something we must address as a civil society,” he said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyZWFraW5nbmV3cy5pZS9pcmVsYW5kL3V2Zi1wcm92aWRlLWFuc3dlcnMtdG8tYmVyZWF2ZWQtZmFtaWx5LTUwLXllYXJzLWFmdGVyLXdlc3QtYmVsZmFzdC1tdXJkZXItMTQ3NjQxNi5odG1s0gF-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnJlYWtpbmduZXdzLmllL2FtcC9pcmVsYW5kL3V2Zi1wcm92aWRlLWFuc3dlcnMtdG8tYmVyZWF2ZWQtZmFtaWx5LTUwLXllYXJzLWFmdGVyLXdlc3QtYmVsZmFzdC1tdXJkZXItMTQ3NjQxNi5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Win McNamee/Getty Images  The Secret Service has launched an investigation into how a man was able to make his way into the Washington, D.C., home of President Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, without the agents on guard noticing, three government officials told The Washington Post.  The incident took place one night in late April, at about 3 a.m. After realizing the man was in his home, Sullivan approached him and told him to leave, two of the officials said. Sullivan has a round-the-clock Secret Service detail, but the agents weren't aware of the intruder until Sullivan went outside and notified them. By that time, the unknown man had left, two officials told the Post.  There were no signs of forced entry, the Post reported, and the intruder seemed to be intoxicated and confused about his whereabouts. The government officials said there is no evidence that the man knew Sullivan or wanted to hurt him. Under normal protocol, the intruder would have been detained by the Secret Service for questioning, and most likely arrested and charged with trespassing.  In a statement, Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the agency is ""taking this matter seriously"" and opened a ""comprehensive mission assurance investigation to review all facets of what occurred. Any deviation from our protective protocols is unacceptable and if discovered, personnel will be held accountable.""  National security advisers used to receive Secret Service protection only while traveling outside of Washington, D.C., a senior national security official told the Post, but after the FBI uncovered in 2021 an Iranian plot to assassinate John Bolton, a national security adviser under former President Donald Trump, the Secret Service added a heightened level of security for the position.

For the latest headlines, follow our Google News channel online or via the app.  Advertisement  “Those involved in these heinous crimes against the military installations and personal/equipment will be brought to justice through trials under relevant laws of Pakistan including Pakistan Army Act and Official Secret Act.”  The military’s sharp reaction marks another escalation in an ongoing showdown between Pakistan’s most powerful institution and Khan, who was arrested by an anti-graft agency and later released by the Supreme Court. His detention sparked widespread anger among his supporters and some groups breached the military headquarters while others set fire to a military commander’s official residence.  At least eight people were killed and scores more arrested, including close aides and political associates of Khan.  The increasingly public defiance against the military signals a shift in attitudes in Pakistan which has been directly ruled by the army for almost half of its history since its creation in 1947. Most prime ministers have depended on the institution’s support to stay in power, including Khan himself, but his ties worsened during his time in power.  Khan attempted to control military promotions, opposing the army chief at the time in an incident that sowed the seeds for his ouster in April last year. He accused the army of conspiring with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the US to oust him, which all three denied. But his campaign to turn public opinion against the military continued.  No direct reference was made to Khan in Monday’s statement but in the days leading to his arrest by paramilitary troops, the army criticized him for accusing the institution of being behind at least two assassination attempts, including a shooting incident in November. The military has consistently denied the allegations.  Khan’s party denied its supporters vandalized army property.  “We also believe that those involved in terrorism against the state must be punished but it is very important that they should be correctly identified,” Shafqat Mahmood, a senior leader in Khan’s Tehreek-e-Insaf party said by phone. “There were people in the crowd who were not our supporters.

Echoing the phrase from anti-Mafia activists in Italy and elsewhere, Zammit warned that unless people take action immediately the situation can only get worse.  “If you won’t listen to the shouts of the living, then you must listen to the screams of Daphne Caruana Galizia who was stalked, harassed, and vilified, before she was brutally assassinated because she knew too much,” she said.  “If you truly want justice for her stories, then why have you consistently failed to implement the recommendations of the inquiry?” Zammit asked in reference to the recommendations put forward by the public inquiry into the murder of the journalist.  She went on to ask why the authorities have so far failed to reopen the Egrant Inquiry as requested by Magistrate Ian Farrugia.  “Have you learnt nothing since Daphne’s assassination about the need to protect those who fight for truth and justice? To protect them from threats and physical harm? What are you waiting for? More deaths?” Zammit said in clear reference to Repubblika president Robert Aquilina’s recent request for protection.  In her speech, Zammit said that Malta is “a corrupt country, and a mafia state,” adding that people fall in three camps; those who endorse corruption, those who turn a blind eye to corruption, and those who actually see the full picture.  “However we’re all experiencing the full picture, whether we like it or not,” she said, as she warned that the end result of greed and corruption is more deaths caused by the unregulated construction industry and road accidents.  “The end result of living in a Mafia state means that shoddy unplanned construction will continue The end result of living in a Mafia State means that more people will die in traffic accidents because of badly planned roads or because of lack of enforcement of the law,” Zammit said.  “The end result of living in a Mafia state is more victims of domestic violence because our institutions can’t pull their fingers out of their collective backsides and protect women.”  ‘We will get there’ – Josef Lauri  Tonight’s vigil was also addressed by academic Josef Lauri who said Daphne Caruana Galizia’s assassination “was a result of a sense of impunity that we saw fostered among those who are surprised by corruption and in love with crime.”  He added that corruption contains the seeds of its own destruction and the system will eventually implode.  “This seed of destruction is growing into a tree. We must continue striving to ensure that we will be here to see the fruits of this tree.”  Lauri said that while people might not have the time and energy to be on the frontline in the fight against corruption, he said the last they can do is remind activists such as those form Repubblika and Occupy Justice, that they are not alone.  “I believe that the phrase that Robert Aquilina likes to repeat, ‘We will get there’ (Sa Naslu!), is true. It will happen if we don’t give up. It will happen if those who fight for change stop the infighting. It will happen if bridges are built between those who disagree with this corrupt government instead of throwing stones at each other.”  Lauri said that while the pessimist in him “tells me that we will get there too slowly, or tells me that I will at least be here to see it, the developments that are happening around us make me hope that we will get there much sooner.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c2Jvb2suY29tLm10L2VuL3RoZS1lbmQtcmVzdWx0LW9mLWxpdmluZy1pbi1hLW1hZmlhLXN0YXRlLWlzLWRlYXRoLXBpYS16YW1taXQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Following publication of Justice Samuel Alito’s leaked opinion raping Roe v. Wade, Pulitzer honoree Linda Greenhouse kernelized the only cogent reason for assassination of a precedent which most of the little legal lightweights had told the U.S. Senate that they considered settled law.  “They did it because they could,” Greenhouse lamented, echoing sentiments which have warmed the Humpty cockles of the rocky hearts of dictators since time immemorial.  In last Sunday’s fake news New York Times, the best commentator in the country, Maureen Dowd, concluded her killer screed stating “Even though I’ve been writing since Bush v. Gore (2000) that the court is full of hacks and the bloom is off the robes, it is still disorienting to see the murk of this Supreme Court.”  Actually, it goes back much further. Control of Black Robe Land by today’s corrupt and self-absorbed majority was fore-ordained more than half a century ago. Just after I invaded these parts from Gomorrah South in 1971, I remember the chill that went down my spine at the announcement that Nevada Republican Party operatives had started a young conservatives club at UNR.  It started paying off just a few years later when a small-government advocate was elected president by promising to clean up the muck of murky Washington. He advocated eroding FDR’s big government welfare state and opposed busing to end school segregation while preaching family values, moral righteousness and religion.  It must have been Ronald Reagan, right? After all, Ronnie the Vague told a Moral Majority gathering that “I know you can’t endorse me but I can endorse you.”  If you guessed that it was the B-movie actor who won the White House playing a perversion of his idol Franklin Roosevelt, you’d be wrong. It was Reagan’s predecessor Jimmy Carter, a master campaigner with slim presidential qualifications, the worst of which was his lack of Washington experience. So he made his thin credentials the centerpiece of his campaign, touting the virtues of being an outsider. Like so many before him, he was hoist from his own petard when Reagan campaigned against him by saying the same thing. “Drain the swamp” still works for dinosaurs posing as alligator hunters.  Fast-forward almost half a century and Dumptyite wolves not only inhabit the henhouse, they’re selling the eggs. Cock-a-doodle-do.  “Americans do not want democracy, they want theocracy,” a French observer noted a few decades back.  The formerly sacrosanct and prestigious Supreme Court is now the appointed-for-life government of the United States. Remember all those moonhowler complaints about an “activist court” and “judge-made law”?  No? Understandable because moonhowler-installed judges are now doing just that.  They have been handsomely rewarded with lucrative deals both aboveboard and under the table. There is no effective remedy. They won and can do whatever they damn well please.  Four decades ago, former Tribunite and legendary talk show icon Travus T. Hipp warned of “softshoe fascism” loose in the land.  Fascism is typified by an authoritarian government which does the bidding of narrow, wealthy, privately-owned interests. As with all dictatorships spawned not by guns but by gushy words enchanting the gullible among the great unwashed, once in power they pull the ladder up behind them.  Said ladder stands on the shredded social safety net of a besieged electorate increasingly unable to elect leaders reflecting their needs — if they are allowed to vote at all.  Corrupt Clarence and his fellow dwarves now have before them a Roe-ing of the 1984 unanimous decision in Chevron v. National Resources Defense Council. Repeal or revision would resemble Alito’s rape of Roe or Neal Gorsuch’s evisceration of the Environmental Protection Agency. (“Poison Annie’s Revenge Executed” Barbwire 7-7-2022; “Happy Co-Dependence Day” 7-3-2005)  I was criticized by the left and right when I asserted that nominee Gorsuch would work to destroy the EPA from which his Mommy Dearest had resigned under a cloud of incompetence, corruption and illegality.  Sometimes I hate it when I’m right. I hope I am proven wrong about the miasma of near-hopelessness enveloping the formerly United States of America.  MEA CULPA DEPT. When I’m wrong, I eat the barbecued crow. A few weeks ago, I praised Reno Gazette-Journal higherups for appointing veteran journalist Peggy Santoro as the second woman executive editor of the paper after Barbara Henry in 1982.

"assassination","2016-11-12","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 16:04:00","Read this in The Manila Times digital edition.  THE efforts of the administration of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to find its voice and a steady footing in global affairs are dragged down by doubts pertaining to a critical domestic issue — the fairness of his administration's justice system. An innocent woman, former senator Leila de Lima, has been in detention for six long years. Meanwhile, the hard men, Teves, Bantag, Zulueta et al., are making a mockery of the justice system. Come and get us ... if you can. How can the outside world not take note of the open defiance, the braggadocio and the taunting? We don't even have a clue as to who masterminded the assassination of a Cagayan vice mayor and the ambush of Lanao del Sur Gov. Mamintal Adiong.  The audacity of Mr. Teves to ask for a Zoom link so he can participate in a Senate inquiry on a Negros Oriental massacre of which he is the prime suspect is the kind of perverted audacity to be found only in the political and judicial systems of banana republics, not in functional democracies committed to the rule of law. Nine people gunned down in cold blood in broad daylight, one of them the provincial governor, and the primary suspect is asking for a Zoom link? It cannot get more surreal than this: the audacity of perversity.  As the world watches this mockery of the judicial system unfold, the contrasting optics of a jailed innocent woman silently bearing her many burdens but keeping her faith in the justice system and the hard men mocking the justice system, uncomfortable questions are raised. The House is even conflicted on what to do with Mr. Teves — kid gloves one day, stern warnings the next. Are not parliaments and congresses of true democracies mandated to stand on the right side of history? And grow a spine whenever tough decisions have to be made?  The giddy malevolence to detain an innocent woman and the feckless indecision on the hard men indicted based on overwhelming evidence.  So, it all comes down to this. The judge righting the terrible wrongs on the case of former senator de Lima — which hopefully will soon lead to her release from detention — is doing a yeoman's job in restoring the credibility and fairness of the Philippine justice system. It is the case of Ms. de Lima and her forthcoming clearance from three trumped-up drug charges — the irony is inescapable — which is now saving the blemished judicial system from its horrific failings.  Get the latest news  delivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times’ daily newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy  As the nation ponders on the next chapter in Ms. de Lima's life after her certain release from detention and the end of her nightmarish six years, what comes to mind are words from biblical times and the US civil rights movement. Words that offer comfort and reassurance, balm to the souls of a nation anguished by the long detention of an innocent woman.  First are the words of Martin Luther King Jr. That the arc of the moral universe — the other version is the arc of history — may be long but it bends toward justice. Indeed, it has been a long, grueling six years — about a third of the years that Nelson Mandela spent at Robben Island — but justice will be finally served on former senator de Lima. Two of the three drug charges have been dropped, the last and final charge has no legs to stand on. The coerced witnesses have recanted. She will soon breathe the air of freedom, then reap the recompense due a victim of political vendetta and a vengeful justice system.  What failed to crush the spirit of former senator de Lima definitely made her stronger. Post-detention, the future is full of possibilities. She can run for Senate, on the back of that familiar Filipino sentiment: unqualified sympathy and support for the victims of injustice. She can help energize — she can even lead — the directionless political opposition. She can go back to defending those languishing in prison without cause, the prisoners of conscience and lead an NGO dedicated to the issues of human rights. Her prison years attracted the attention of political leaders from the major democracies, who gave support and encouragement. That group of powerful people vests her with international connections.  What is the guarantee, the certainty, that she would be at the receiving end of glorious and generous recompense? Read the Sermon on the Mount, the greatest speech every written. It says, ""Blessed are the persecuted."" No prominent Filipino in the 21st century has gone through and endured more persecution and vindictiveness than former senator de Lima. Yet, she took everything with equanimity and grit and grace. On the scale of the recompense, the answer is itself biblical — double for your trouble. After the persecution, she will be able to write her future story.  The persecuted, along with the weak and the meek and the humble, have from time immemorial held on to the Beatitudes as their only article of faith toward the path of redemption and liberation. (The same case with us, farmers and workers, because there is no other article of faith to hold on to.) Because no other document in the entire human history is as clear, as explicit, about the blessed status of those in dire straits. Indeed, blessed is Leila de Lima, the persecuted.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbmlsYXRpbWVzLm5ldC8yMDIzLzA1LzE3L29waW5pb24vY29sdW1ucy9sZWlsYS1kZS1saW1hLXNlcm1vbi1vbi10aGUtbW91bnQtYW5kLW1hcnRpbi1sdXRoZXIta2luZy1qci8xODkxODI20gF-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFuaWxhdGltZXMubmV0LzIwMjMvMDUvMTcvb3Bpbmlvbi9jb2x1bW5zL2xlaWxhLWRlLWxpbWEtc2VybW9uLW9uLXRoZS1tb3VudC1hbmQtbWFydGluLWx1dGhlci1raW5nLWpyLzE4OTE4MjYvYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Kennedy Jr., who is running in second place to incumbent President Biden in the 2024 primary sweeps, told Fox News that his once antiwar party has made a 180-degree turn as middle-class Americans struggle to live with a hurting economy.  Kennedy, who is the son of former New York senator and U.S. Attorney General Bobby Kennedy, and nephew of former President John Kennedy and ex-Sen. Edward Kennedy, said the party his family once embodied has changed much in recent years.  ""The Democratic Party at this point has become the party of war, which we've never been before. We've sent $113 billion Ukraine and the entire budget of EPA is $12 billion, and the budget at the CDC is $12 billion,"" he said Tuesday on ""Special Report.""  Kennedy argued 57% of Americans could not ""put their hands on $1,000 if they have an emergency.""  RFK JR DOUBLES DOWN ON ALLEGATION CIA INVOLVED IN UNCLE'S ASSASSINATION  ""I think a lot of Americans are feeling like they're tired of the forever-wars,"" he said. ""They're tired of this being a warfare state abroad and a surveillance state at home. And they want to get rid of the surveillance here [and] the wars abroad.""  Kennedy contrasted the trillions in military spending with what some of those funds could do for domestic infrastructure, employment and education.  ""Our real national strength is going to come from economic power and a robust economy and a robust middle class and not from projecting military power abroad,"" he said.  Kennedy also said he has no personal animus against Biden, and has been friends with him for some time, as ""Special Report"" anchor Bret Baier cited a recent poll showing him the closest to the president with 19% support.  ""I have a long kind of friendship and relationship with President Biden, so I'm not criticizing him or attacking him personally. But I think people want to see him out of the White House and actually talking to Americans; going to town halls,"" he said.  ABC NEWS ADMITS EDITING RFK JR'S VAX CLAIMS  ""[He] says that the economy is humming along, but that's not what I hear when I'm out in western Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Hampshire, Florida. I see people really living in a state of desperation that I never thought I would see in the United States of America,"" Kennedy added.  Kennedy compared purported statistics that showed a steep decline in middle-class power and wealth between the 1970s and 2020s, claiming 62% of U.S. income in 1978 was among the middle class, while that figure has dropped to 40%.  ""In 1978, 29% of income went to the super rich. [Now] it's 50%. And that was aggravated, of course, by the pandemic,"" he said, adding that some of that dearth was a product of what he called ""Donald Trump's pandemic lockdown – which created 500 new billionaires.""  CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Kennedy signaled he is not a fan of some of the former Republican president's policies while dismissing a charge in the Washington Post that his candidacy is Trumpism with a Camelot label.  ""His name is Kennedy. His campaign is pure Trump,"" Baier read of the headline from the paper, which also wrote that Kennedy is offering a ""variation"" on Trumpian criticisms of government and science while ""stoking fear and resentment,"" claiming the 2nd place Democrat's campaign sounds somewhat like Trump's own ""America First"" bid.  Kennedy responded that Trump's tenure saw $4 trillion in wealth shifted to the ""super-rich"" and that there have been millions of business closures under the Republican's administration that have also followed into Biden's tenure.  ""I think a lot of Americans want somebody who's really going to start listening to the middle class, understanding the desperation that so many Americans feel, and that is going to do something about it,"" he said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hiYW5nb3IuY29tL25ld3MvbmF0aW9uYWwvcmZrLWpyLXNheXMtZGVtcy1oYXZlLWJlY29tZS1wYXJ0eS1vZi13YXItYW1lcmljYW5zLWNhbnQtYWZmb3JkLWEtMS0wMDAvYXJ0aWNsZV8zYzUwNTA0Ni1jN2RmLTU2MjUtYmJlZi0wNTdlYzYxOTcwNTMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","1994-07-23","10:00:00","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 04:40:45","Azerbaijan arrested at least nine of its nationals, suspected of being linked to Iranian secret services and of plotting a coup and assassinations, officials said on Tuesday.  The latest round in tensions between Baku and Tehran, whose relations have traditionally been strained, came after the expulsion of diplomats from both countries.  On Tuesday, Azerbaijan’s law enforcement forces arrested people who “were working for Iranian secret services,” the interior ministry, security service, and the office of prosecutor general said in a joint statement.  The statement gave nine names and said several other people had been arrested.  The group was plotting a “violent overthrow of the government and the assassinations of prominent personalities and senior officials,” the statement said.  The wave of arrests follows the detention of six Azerbaijani nationals in a different case in April. They were accused of being “recruited by Iranian secret services to destabilize the situation in the country.”  Azerbaijan is a close ally of Iran’s historical rival, Turkey.  Tehran also fears that Israel – a major weapons supplier to Azerbaijan – could use Azerbaijani territory for an offensive against Iran.  Ties between neighbors Azerbaijan and Iran further soured in January when a gunman stormed into Baku’s embassy in Tehran.  He killed a diplomat and wounded two embassy security guards.  The Azerbaijani foreign ministry blamed Iran for the shooting, a claim that the Iranian foreign ministry has rejected.  Earlier in May, Iran expelled four Azerbaijani diplomats. The foreign ministry said the move was “in response” to Baku’s expulsion of Iranian embassy staff in April.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRlZmVuc2Vwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE3L2F6ZXJiYWlqYW4tY291cC1wbG90LWlyYW4v0gFIaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlZGVmZW5zZXBvc3QuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTcvYXplcmJhaWphbi1jb3VwLXBsb3QtaXJhbi9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2023-05-10","Not Discerned","{""Ashqelon"", ""Hadarom"", ""Israel""}","Tue 16 May 2023 20:35:26","A man in a prayer shawl stands by a structure in Ashkelon, Israel, that was destroyed by a rocket fired by Palestinian militants on Wednesday. (Ariel Schalit / Associated Press)  Now that there’s an Israeli-Palestinian cease-fire in place this week, brokered with the help of Egypt, it’s critical that the two sides not stop with this short-term agreement.  For this cease-fire — in fact, any cease-fire — to become permanent, we need a political process to begin immediately. The alternative is to keep seeing Israelis and Palestinians traumatized and killed as militants and politicians practice one-upmanship against each other.  It would be easy to place blame on this or that side. It’s possible to list the number of Palestinian rockets that were launched at Israel and the number of targets that Israel attacked. But what good would that do?  The Palestinian-Israeli cycle of violence has become so normalized that it no longer elicits serious interest from the world community. Whether one side uses precision rockets that kill children and women or the other uses indiscriminate rockets that cause injury, death and destruction, the resulting carnage is the same.  Those on each side scream that there is no partner on the other side, when what they mean is that there is no partner that fits their own perception of a good counterpart. But peace is made with enemies.  Resorting to violence, whether it is extrajudicial assassination or indiscriminate shelling, is not the answer. Both are war crimes and perpetrators must be held accountable. But the conflict is not symmetrical, and so solutions might require more from one side than the other. Anyone who really wants to end this conflict must invest time and effort into forcing everyone back to the negotiating table.  In all cases, some fundamental principles need to be established. Self-determination is a right for all people, and the application of this right cannot be limited to one side of the conflict. It is impossible to talk about Israel’s political rights without equally respecting Palestinian political rights.  A solution to the conflict requires an end to occupation, allowing Palestinians to live in freedom whether this is in their own sovereign and contiguous state or in a single state where all citizens have equal rights. The current discriminatory situation with one side occupying the lands of the other side must stop.  Story continues  All sides have to commit to refraining from actions that can affect the outcome of negotiations. This includes stopping Israeli settlement expansion, and both sides must ensure that civilians are protected from violence — from the Israeli army and settlers as well as from Palestinian paramilitary organizations.  There has to be a commitment to discussing in good faith the future of Jerusalem, settlements, refugees and borders. And there needs to be a Palestinian commitment to security coordination, conditional on Israel respecting Palestinian sovereignty in major cities. Something as basic a right as a free passage between Gaza and the West Bank must be respected.  No one is naïve enough to think that these commitments will happen overnight. Any political process — even to begin a process — will need the support of the people of the region and the international community. Staying away from a conflict in which one side is powerful and the other side weak (but not willing to surrender) will not produce any kind of solution.  We cannot afford to accept the idea that we’re doomed to a never-ending conflict. This would be a cop-out. But we need to go beyond politically correct statements and positions if we’re to find a way out.  Despite all the problems and the decades of war, there is still a genuine yearning for peace. While in the middle of a cycle of violence, all sides are polarized, and everyone returns to their known positions and embraces the policies of their tribe, right or wrong. This cannot go on.  Palestinians and Israelis have been unable to find a comprehensive solution. Right now, everyone is taking sides while living in the middle of the bloodshed. What is needed is help from outside to get us out of the mess we are in.  For the sake of our children, the international community has to resume a role in helping to break this cycle of violence. Yes, it will take sustained effort. But Israelis and Palestinians cannot do it alone.

"assassination","1994-07-06","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 14:41:35","A new court case on Genocide against Tutsi is going on in France which is meant to last at least two months full of strong revelations in the tragedy that befell Rwanda and cost more than one million innocent lives in three consecutive months of April, May, June and early July 1994.  The case involves a suspect Philippe Hategekimana 67, Rwandan naturalized French (since 2005) under the name of Philippe Manier and the prosecution at the French Court of Assise.  This former chief warrant officer at the Gendarmerie of Nyanza, in the prefecture of Butare (southern Rwanda) during the Genocide, was famously known under the name Biguma.  He was arrested in March 2018 in Yaoundé-Cameroon and extradited to France, then indicted and placed in pre-trial detention the following year.  He is accused of genocide, crimes against humanity and participation in a group for the preparation of Genocide crimes.  More precisely, Hategekimana is accused to have participated in the erection of two roadblocks which intended to control and assassinate Tutsi civilians. Hundreds of Tutsi indeed were assassinated at these spots, according to the prosecution.  He is further accused of assassination of the burgomaster of Ntyazo, Narcisse Nyagasaza and the massacre of Tutsi who had taken refuge at Nyabubare and Nyamure hills of Rwabicuma and Muyira sectors of Nyanza district respectively.  This is on top of an alleged participation in several meetings aimed at preparing or coordinating the crimes.  In a press release before the trial, the French national anti-terrorist prosecutor’s office (Pnat) indicated that the massacre cost lives of 300 Tutsi and 10,000 Tutsi at Nyabubare and Nyamure hills respectively.  At the meeting to prepare the trial on May 10, already, the prosecution, the defense and even the presiding judge promised that the case will involve strong emotions, thus a warning to parties in the trial, especially the witnesses to get ready and to know to control their emotions because “violent scenarios will most likely be described.”  I am not the person you are looking for  As in any court case, at the trial kick off, the defence and their client played the first card, that of identity, alleging that the person in front of the court, was not the same person the prosecution was talking about.  The defence played around the name of the alias of their clients, arguing that “Biguma was found guilty, of Genocide offenses, but Phlippe Hategekimana was acquitted by Gacaca Court.”  However, the defendant later on admitted to being Biguma, a name he got while in military training back in Rwanda.  After this, the other big question was around his naturalisation which he obtained after giving a wrong name of Philippe Manier, instead of Philippe Hategekimana.  The wrong identity, he said, he invented while still in a refugee camp in Kashusha-South Kivu of  “You used a wrong identity to get the nationality of France while taking the name Manier?” asked the presiding judge, to which he responded: “Yes. At first, to obtain refugee status, we needed a convincing document.”  Audition of Testimonies  In this trial where more than 90 witnesses could be heard, already the witnesses of the context are being heard, and as earlier promised, they are sharing strong testimonies.  They even include Western Citizens and Rwandan citizen who were in Rwanda during the 1994 Genocide against Tutsi. Even the foreigners, can share the places where Interahamwe militia were the most brutal with mutilation of women, rape among others.  Several witnesses include researchers, historians among other people who did not just see one incident of Genocide, but many, and also did more research on the background that led to the Genocide tragedy in Rwanda.  The list also includes former leaders in the Rwanda military and gendarmerie and officials under the Juvenal Habyarimana’s regime  One of the witnesses, Hélène Dumas 41, a Doctor in social sciences and specialist on Genocide against Tutsi went as far as sharing a story of a girl who was obliged to feed on blood after starving.  Hélène understands quite everything in the Genocide, and even, Rwanda’s reconciliation’s home-grown solutions and recovery efforts, to an extent that she is even able to explain ‘Gacaca jurdictions’ from its etymology.  Of all things that were said, some witnesses were direct to mention the name Philippe Hategekimana as a person who was involved in the Genocide, and yesterday, as the presiding judge asked the defendant what he would add, he was prompt to say.  “Everything they said is false.”  Hategekimana’s defence include Me Emmanuel Altit, Alexis Guedj and Fabio Lhote.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmt0cHJlc3MucncvMjAyMy8wNS9uZXctdHJpYWwtaW4tZnJhbmNlLXByb21pc2VzLXRvLXNoZWQtbW9yZS1saWdodC1vbi1nZW5vY2lkZS1hZ2FpbnN0LXR1dHNpLWF0cm9jaXRpZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The independent Russian portal Agentstwo claims that former US ambassador to Ukraine, John Herbst is among these Moscow's would-be victims.  The diplomat complained of mysterious health problems similar to symptoms of poisoning back in 2021, a few months before Russia had invaded Ukraine. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has launched an investigation into the case, the website reported, citing its informants who remain anonymous.    Herbst was the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine between 2003-2006 and headed the U.S. diplomatic mission in Uzbekistan.    The head of the Free Russia Foundation, Natalia Arno, was another target of the Russian secret services. The activist, while visiting the Czech Republic on business at the beginning of May 2023, had suddenly started feeling numbness and pain in various parts of her body. Shortly before these symptoms appeared, Arno had discovered a break-in into her hotel room.    She also reported a strange smell in the room resembling “the smell of cheap perfume”. Following the incident Arno immediately returned to the United States, where she lives. The FBI has also launched an investigation into the matter, since the Free Russia Foundation, headed by Arno, is based in Washington.    The independent portal claims that the head of investigative portal Bellingcat, Christo Grozev, has also fallen victim to the Kremlin’s agents. In the summer of 2022, during a journalistic conference in Montenegro, unknown perpetrators broke into his hotel room stealing several items, including his smartphone.    A few months later Grozev decided to move from Austria to the USA after he received warnings of an assassination attempt.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdHZwd29ybGQuY29tLzY5ODgyNDU2L3J1c3NpYS1oYWQtYXR0ZW1wdGVkLXRvLXBvaXNvbi1wcm9taW5lbnQtb3Bwb25lbnRzLXNvdXJjZXMtc2F50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2019-05-12","Not Discerned","{""NewYork"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 01:53:54","Due to the mass struggle, white ex-Marine Daniel Penny, whose 15-minutes-long chokehold led to the death of Jordan Neely — a 30-year-old African American houseless and mentally ill man — was charged with second-degree manslaughter. If convicted — and that is a very big IF — he could face anywhere between 5-to-15 years in prison. Penny had at least two accomplices who held Neely’s arms and legs as he was being slowly asphyxiated; the two have not been charged.  When Penny was brought in for questioning by the New York Police Department May 1 — the day that the murder took place on a F subway train, he was released without being charged with anything.  Starting on May 2, spontaneous and planned demonstrations took place for days, including one that blocked a subway track, demanding that Penny be charged. That demand wasn’t realized until May 12, when Penny turned himself in after the District Attorney announced the manslaughter charges. Jordan Neely’s family and their attorneys, while saying they were “pleased” with the charges, had asked that Penny be charged with second-degree murder, which would have amounted to a harsher sentence if convicted.  Penny was immediately released on $100,000 bail. How did such a large sum get raised so fast? A white supremacist-based crowd fundraising site, under the guise of being “Christian,” GiveSendGo, has raised over $1 million to date to support Penny’s legal expenses. The fundraising was organized by his lawyers; within just 24 hours of Penny being charged, $600,000 was raised for his defense.  This same site raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for white-supremacist Kyle Rittenhouse, who killed two anti-racist Black Lives Matter protesters in Wisconsin in 2020; the January 6, 2021, pro-Trump U.S. Capitol riot defendants; and the so-called “Freedom Convoy” — a group of truckers in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, who in 2022 protested a rule requiring cross-border drivers to be vaccinated.  Extreme right-wing Republicans like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Twitter owner and billionaire Elon Musk and Fox News pundits all praised Penny for the killing. Their comments condoning Neely’s death are too disgusting to mention here.  Once again, the character of the victim — in this case Jordan Neely — a houseless, hungry, mentally ill and desperate man, who happened to be Black, is being put on trial in public. Penny’s lawyers will use character assassination as a major defense to justify this killing by a white vigilante.  And this kind of heinous reaction is not isolated to just one individual. It is part of a racist war to justify such murders by the police and racist vigilantes like Penny by demonizing the victims, especially young Black men like Neely, Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, Trayvon Martin in Florida and even 12-year-old Tamir Rice in Ohio, who were all falsely and cruelly labeled a danger and a menace to society.  And the fact that a sector of the ruling class supports the actions of Penny illustrates that he has a lot of big-business support to attempt to exonerate him of this terrible crime.  This is another reason why a united political classwide struggle should abolish this horrendous capitalist system — to guarantee all the human needs that the Jordan Neelys of the world cry out for and deserve.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiJmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndvcmtlcnMub3JnLzIwMjMvMDUvNzA5Mjcv0gEqaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud29ya2Vycy5vcmcvMjAyMy8wNS83MDkyNy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The hugely-controversial Prince Mohammed bin Salman is often cited as being a fan of video games, with his preferred franchise being Call of Duty. This likely had an influence on PIF's choice to invest in Activision Blizzard.  He has also been blamed by the CIA for the assassination of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, while his rule of Saudi Arabia has kept up the country's notoriously poor human rights record, as homosexuality is still criminalised with punishments ranging from floggings to the death penalty.

"assassination","2023-11-01","15:00:00","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 12:11:15","Assassin’s Creed Mirage leaks are coming thick and fast ahead of June’s Ubisoft Forward showcase and – if what we’re hearing is true – it looks like Assassin’s Creed fans have quite a lot to look forward to when it comes to the upcoming release Assassin’s Creed Mirage. In fact, this is shaping up to be one of the best Assassin’s Creed games yet. We have known that this title is going to be a return to the series’ roots for a while now, but a content creator with a history of AC Mirage leaks has further teased a myriad of features that suggest we could be in for an investigative gameplay experience more similar to what we would see in IO Interactive’s Hitman series – and that’s very exciting.  Discussing leaked information about Assassin’s Creed Mirage in French, which was initially translated by fans on this Assassin’s Creed subreddit post and then double-checked by The Loadout using YouTube’s translation tool, renowned leaker ‘j0nathon’ has shared that this game will feature fewer assassination targets than recent Assassin’s Creed games that players will need to spend time investigating before attempting to eliminate – with options opening up as you continue to uncover more information about each target.  At a basic level, before looking into the details, this is something that echoes the gameplay structure presented to players in the immensely-popular stealth-action series Hitman World of Assassination. You’re thrown into an environemnt where you must investigate to find out where your target is, or will be, and how you can eliminate them. We know that is a little reductive, but that’s the bare bones of the gameplay structure – and that sounds like what we’re getting in Assassin’s Creed Mirage.  Fuelling comparisons further, while also further reinforcing claims that this game will see the reintroduction of a notoriety system to the Assassin’s Creed series, ‘j0nathan’ has also expressed that Basim will have “very little life” – dying after just a couple of hits. This will encourage stealth-based gameplay and – once again – echoes the Hitman series. Those of you who have played this game will know it’s not as easy as it looks to shoot your way out of a sticky situation if you’ve been spotted.  While this information, like these recent Assassin’s Creed Mirage leaks, will be welcome news to fans who don’t particularly like the RPG-heavy focus the series has taken with recent entries, it does suggest that we might be met with some rather out-dated gameplay experiences when the Assassin’s Creed Mirage release date rolls around. Missions structured around tailing targets and eavesdropping conversations are dated, but this is where Ubisoft could draw on Hitman to save Assassin’s Creed from these mediocre moments.  IO Interactive leans into these sorts of gameplay sequences in the Hitman series, but they’re presented to players as optional objectives – and always situated in a largely unguided mission overflowing with options when it comes to how you approach the main objective: eliminating your target.  At the moment, though, we don’t know how much freedom Assassin’s Creed players will enjoy when it comes to undertaking these investigations. But, we’re hopeful – it just remains to be seen whether that hope was misplaced, or not. As you can see below, though, the leaker sharing this information compares a lot of this to the original Assassin’s Creed game – which is somewhat worrying. However, like us, they also suggest that the “black box missions” – where you actually assassinate your target – will draw inspiration from the Hitman series.  We know it’s important to take every leak with a pinch or two of salt, as there’s no telling how true this all is, but ‘j0nathan’ has a good track record when it comes to Assassin’s Creed Mirage leaks that corroborate with others and all the information he’s shared seems to line up with what we know officially about the game so far. GamesRadar’s interview with creative director Stéphane Boudon is packed with information about the scope and scale of this title – and where Ubisoft is drawing inspiration (although Hitman isn’t mentioned).  Will it be one of the best games of all time? We’re not so sure about that, as there’s some stiff competition there, but a Basim-based Assassin’s Creed game is bound to be interesting. So, while we wait for more information on all the Assassin’s Creed multiplayer games Ubisoft is supposedly working on, we can’t think of anyone better to lead the next chapter in this series.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWxvYWRvdXQuY29tL2Fzc2Fzc2lucy1jcmVlZC1taXJhZ2UvbGVha3MtZ2FtZXBsYXktZmVhdHVyZXMtaGl0bWFu0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2010-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 18:03:26","Emilia Clarke, Leonardo DiCaprio and Drew Barrymore have all narrowly escaped death. Photos / Getty Images, AP  Celebrities fool us with their jaw-dropping film stunts so often it feels like they are superhuman. But it turns out some of their near-death experiences would leave even Hollywood shocked.  A prime example came earlier in the year when Marvel star Jeremy Renner narrowly escaped death trying to stop his seven-tonne Pistenbully snowplough from running over his nephew. After breaking more than 30 broken bones and a punctured lung, the actor has undergone intensive rehab and is finally back on his feet.  Jamie Foxx also suffered a close call recently when he was rushed to hospital with an unknown medical emergency. One month later, the star is reportedly still in hospital and little has been revealed about his condition.  But Renner and Foxx aren’t the only famous faces who have escaped death in their lifetime. Ozzy Osbourne has experienced a few near-death scenarios, Emilia Clarke survived two brain aneurysms and Kanye West was involved in a terrifying car accident.  From house fires to plane accidents and strokes, here are nine celebrities who cheated death:  Drew Barrymore  Drew Barrymore. Photo / Getty Images  She’s a Hollywood sweetheart with a slew of successful films behind her and a talk show that makes other celebrities feel at home - but all that could have been quite different for the actress if it weren’t for her labrador, Flossie.  In 2001, Barrymore and her then-fiance Tom Green almost died in a fire when their five-bedroom home in Beverly Hills caught fire. Asleep and unaware of the flames engulfing their estate, the couple narrowly escaped thanks to their dog.  A spokesperson told the New York Post at the time, “Flossie barked and literally banged on their bedroom door. She was really the main alert that there was a fire.” Still groggy from sleep, Barrymore then smelt smoke and woke up Green before calling emergency services, however the fast-moving blaze cut into the telephone wires and the line went dead.  Thankfully the dispatchers located the address and Barrymore, Green, Flossie and her two other dogs, Highla Flopsy and Templeton, escaped through heavy smoke.  Mark Wahlberg  Mark Wahlberg. Photo / AP  The heartbreaking terrorist attack that killed 3002 people on September 11, 2001 almost saw a very famous casualty.  Wahlberg was initially booked on American Airlines Flight 11 - the plane which crashed into the north tower of the World Trade Centre - but he changed his flight to a different one a few days earlier.  Wahlberg narrowly cheating death was all thanks to a friend who had asked him to change his plans and fly up to Toronto to watch his film at the Toronto Film Festival.  Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane also had a ticket for the same flight but his agent told him the wrong departure time, which saw the star miss boarding by a few minutes. He ultimately took another flight and survived.  Sharon Stone  Sharon Stone. Photo / Getty Images  At 65 years old, Sharon Stone has done a lot in her lifetime including winning a Golden Globe. But there were moments she wasn’t sure she was going to see the future, let alone the next day.  Speaking to The Sun in 2020, the actress revealed she has cheated death three times, once after being struck by lightning, another after suffering a stroke, and once when she almost cut her jugular open.  She told the news outlet: “I’ve had a lot of things, it’s crazy. I had my neck cut to a sixteenth of an inch from my jugular vein when I was 14 on a clothesline.  “I’ve been hit by lightning and, wow, that was really intense,” she said, adding, “I was at home, we had our own well. I was filling up the iron with water and I had my hand on the tap.  “The well got hit by lightning and it came up through the water. I was indoors and I got picked up and thrown across the kitchen and hit the refrigerator. Thankfully my mum belted me round the face and brought me to.”  As if that wasn’t enough, the Pennsylvania-born actress also suffered a stroke in 2001 and was hospitalised for nine days as a result. Despite her 1 per cent chance of survival, the mother-of-three is alive and well, reflecting on how “tremendously lucky” she is to be alive.  Speaking to Harpers Bazaar, she said, “I felt like I had been shot in the head. I remember laying there thinking, ‘I’m having a stroke’.”  Following the stroke, the actress underwent a seven-hour surgery and had 22 coils inserted into her brain.  Leonardo DiCaprio  Leonardo DiCaprio. Photo / AP  While the encounters were quite different, much like Stone, DiCaprio has cheated death three times.  The Hollywood alum told Wired magazine in 2015 that he has escaped death three times - one of those times being when a great white shark “jumped into my cage when I was diving in South Africa”.  “Half its body was in the cage, and it was snapping at me,” DiCaprio recalled. “They leave the tops open and you have a regulator line running to the surface. Then they chum the water with tuna. A wave came and the tuna sort of flipped up into the air. A shark jumped up and grabbed the tuna, and half its body landed inside the cage with me. I sort of fell down to the bottom and tried to lie flat.  “The great white took about five or six snaps an arm’s length away from my head. The guys there said that has never happened in the 30 years they’d been doing it.”  Other near-death experiences the star survived included his plane engine exploding mid-air and a skydiving mishap when both of his parachutes had issues and almost didn’t open. The first chute was tangled and so was the second, but thankfully the instructor untangled it in time and they landed injury-free.  Queen Elizabeth  Queen Elizabeth II. Photo / AP  In 1981, Queen Elizabeth’s reign almost came to an end when a New Zealand man conducted an assassination attempt.  On October 14 that year, 17-year-old Christopher Lewis tracked the royal tour to the Otago Museum in Dunedin where he concealed a .22 (5.6mm) calibre rifle in an old pair of jeans and hid in a toilet cubical at the Adams Building. Out of sight from the general public, Lewis pointed the gun out of the window and shot at the Queen as she exited a car.  Thankfully, the shot did not hit the Queen or anyone else but it did create a loud noise and police told journalists that it was from a sign falling down.  Jackie Chan  Jackie Chan.  He’s one of the greatest stuntmen in the world and is known for performing all of his own film stunts but one performance almost changed everything for Jackie Chan.  While filming a stunt for the 1986 film Armour of God, Chan’s character chugs from a freshly opened beer can and leaps off a ledge before swinging from a tree. The first stunt went smoothly but when he attempted it again things took a scary turn.  Chan made it to the tree but unfortunately slipped and plummeted to the ground where he hit his head on a rock and cracked his skull. The injury left him with internal bleeding and blood dripping out of his ear. The film crew didn’t have a medical professional onsite and had to carry him down the mountain they were filming on to the hospital where “surgeons tended to his cracked skull and the bone that had penetrated his brain as a result of the fall”, reports said.  Other injuries the actor has sustained include a pelvis dislocation, spinal damage, broken bones - and he has even been electrocuted.  Isla Fisher  Isla Fisher. Photo / Getty Images  Actress Isla Fisher revealed on Chelsea Lately in 2013 that while shooting a scene for the hit film Now You See Me, she was stuck underwater for almost three minutes.  Fisher was in the middle of filming a magic trick in a water tank that was meant to be a simple escape for the star, however she found herself in trouble when her release chain got stuck in her costume.  “I was actually drowning,” she said. “Everyone thought I was acting fabulously... no one realised I was actually struggling.”  Despite laughing while telling the story, the actress said it was a traumatising ordeal.  Brendan Fraser  Brendan Fraser in The Mummy.  Brendan Fraser made his welcome return to Hollywood last year after starring in the award-winning film, The Whale but his acting career - and life - almost came to an end while filming the 1999 film The Mummy.  In one scene Fraser’s character was meant to be hung, so he was standing on a platform with a rope around his neck. Wanting the scene to look as realistic as possible, the star recalled the moment telling UK comedy show, There’s Something About Movies, “I remember the camera came around, and I thought, ‘I’m gonna make this look really good,’ so I sort of took a few deep breaths and kind of barred down. Then I realized I was on the balls of my feet and the rope was going up and I had nowhere to go. Then the world kind of dialled down.”  The star passed out and was thankfully okay but woke up to the film’s stunt co-ordinator clapping in his face. “He goes, ‘Hey. Congratulations. You just joined the club with Mel Gibson. He got choked out on Braveheart, too.’”  Emilia Clarke  Emilia Clarke. Photo / Getty Images  Game of Thrones actress Emilia Clarke suffered not one but two brain aneurysms throughout her rise to fame on the hit series and it resulted in the inability to use significant parts of her brain.  Speaking to the BBC last year, the 36-year-old star said, “It was the most excruciating pain,” explaining she suffered severe headaches that came on suddenly during a workout in February 2011, roughly around the time she was wrapping up filming the first season of the HBO hit.  “The amount of my brain that is no longer usable... it’s remarkable that I am able to speak, sometimes articulately, and live my life completely normally with absolutely no repercussions.”  She said after her second major episode, blood was cut off to her brain for over a minute, meaning it will no longer work. She likened the condition to having your brain “short circuit”.

"assassination","1963-11-22","Not Discerned","{""Dallas"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 15:02:30","Howard Hunt is definitely one of the most mysterious personalities in the history of the United States. His story has been recently covered by the HBO series White House Plumbers, and through that show, we get some hints about his involvement in some of the most significant milestones in American history, from the Bay of Pigs invasion to the Watergate scandal, up to his famous deathbed confession where he revealed classified information related to the assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy. His true story can become a book, but in this article, we will summarize the main points of his life.  Before the White House Plumbers and Watergate: The Bay of Pigs invasion  E. Howard Hunt joined the CIA in 1949. He was immediately assigned to political action and influence, in the department that later became the CIA’s Special Activities Division. As part of that role, he actively participated in the United States’ operation in Cuba in 1961, culminating in the Bay of Pigs invasion.  That operation intended to overthrow Fidel Castro’s government in Cuba as part of the broader Cold War of those years. The Bay of Pigs invasion was supposed to be a military operation secretly supported by the United States. The plan was to land a force of Cuban exiles, trained and supported by the CIA, at the Bay of Pigs on the southern coast of Cuba. The hope was that a popular uprising would follow, leading to the downfall of Castro.  The operation was planned and approved during the administration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, but it was carried out under President John F. Kennedy. The CIA trained and equipped around 1,400 Cuban exiles for the invasion. Howard Hunt was among those who were preparing the exiles for the government they were supposed to form after the invasion, under the direct influence of the United States. However, the Bay of Pigs invasion failed: John F. Kennedy decided to withhold air support after the international community became aware of the operation, which became the decisive factor for the failure.  That’s why the Bay of Pigs invasion is mentioned so often in the HBO series White House Plumbers: it’s considered an emblematic example of how operations fail if those who order them step back in the middle of the action. For Howard Hunt, the failure of the Cuban operation became a crucial turning point for his career: after that scandal, Kennedy’s administration publicly reacted against the CIA’s covert operations. From this point of view, Howard Hunt became one of those officers who needed to be blamed as a bad guy, although he was just executing orders. This detail of Howard Hunt’s perspective will come back soon.  The Watergate scandal  When Howard Hunt was assigned as one of the heads of the White House Plumbers, his task was (again) to execute an order: his team had to bug the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington, D.C. However, on June 17, 1972, the burglars who broke into the Watergate complex were arrested, and quite soon, the connection with Howard Hunt and Gordon Liddy became clear.  In the beginning, after the arrests, Nixon’s administration put its best effort into covering up the White House Plumbers operation, in an attempt to avoid a reputation problem for the U.S. President. As we know, the attempt failed: thanks to the efforts of newspapers like The Washington Post, Time, and The New York Times, with the help of the infamous deep throat in contact with the reporters, it was revealed that the White House deposited considerable sums of money in the bank accounts of the burglars, trying to cover the operation’s costs and motivate them to hide precious information during the trial.  Once again, Howard Hunt was first asked to execute the orders, then became a public problem for the United States government. As reported by the New York Times in this article, during the Watergate investigations, Howard Hunt declared in front of the Senate committee:  “I am crushed by the failure of my government to protect me and my family as in the past it has always done for its clandestine agents. I cannot escape feeling that the country I have served for my entire life and which directed me to carry out the Watergate entry is punishing me for doing the very things it trained and directed me to do.”  In December 1972, in the middle of the Watergate investigations, Howard Hunt’s wife Dorothy died in a mysterious plane crash. According to their son Saint John Hunt, who years later disclosed important information he knew from his father, the crash was orchestrated to put pressure on his dad. As reported in this article, he said: “A day after my mom died, my dad pled guilty. The day after the plane crash, Nixon appointed one of his closest advisers to head the crash investigation.”  Howard Hunt served 33 months in prison for the Watergate scandal. After he was released, he will spend the rest of his life as a book writer. But before dying, he had the chance to reveal some secret information that became famous as the “deathbed confession of Howard Hunt.”  The deathbed confession of Howard Hunt  The deathbed confession is a series of tapes recorded by Howard Hunt in 2004 and sent to his son Saint John Hunt. The content of these tapes was first revealed in 2007 on RollingStone and then became part of the book Saint John published in 2012, Bond of Secrecy: My Life with CIA Spy and Watergate Conspirator E. Howard Hunt. You can hear part of the content of that tapes in the video below, inside an interview Saint John had with Coast to Coast Live.  Deathbed Confession of E Howard Hunt Watch this video on YouTube.  It’s important to note that the accusations in Howard Hunt’s deathbed confession have never been proven, and many consider them just a conspiracy theory. The content, after all, is explosive: in that tape, Hunt explains that there was a direct connection between the assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy and key figures of the United States government, implying that the murder was ordered by Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson, who wanted to become President (he succeeded Kennedy in 1963).  It’s the last element that gives an aura of mystery to the life of Howard Hunt.

"assassination","2023-05-15","Not Discerned","{""PortAuPrince"", ""Ouest"", ""Haiti""}","Wed 17 May 2023 05:01:39","News emerging on Monday that the Haitian Government has now turned to Africa and Latin America for help to deal with the security crisis there is further indication of that Caribbean nation's dire need for assistance.  A Caribbean Media Corporation story reports Haiti's Foreign Affairs Minister Mr Jean Généus as saying that Prime Minister Ariel Henry recently spoke with Senegalese President Macky Sall, and talks are being held with other African and Latin American countries.  The Haitian Government has apparently come to the conclusion that there is a lack of interest on the part of Western states to provide military assistance to Haiti, which has been gripped by political and economic crises since the assassination of President Jovenel Moise in July 2021.  Rival gangs have taken control of up to 80 per cent of the capital, Port-au-Prince, and have continued a deadly fight for more territory.  The UN reports that more than 840 people were killed in the first three months of this year, while over 600 people have been slain in April alone. Also, more than 400 people have been kidnapped so far this year.  And, if that were not bad enough, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has reported that the gang violence has placed more than 115,000 children at the risk of starving to death this year, an increase from the near 86,000 last year.  Adding to the Haitian people's woes is the more than 41,000 suspected cases of cholera reported since the resurgence of the acute diarrhoeal illness in October, with children under the age of 14 making up almost half of the cases, UNICEF has told us.  The UN agency says it urgently needs US$17 million to help detect malnutrition and purchase food and medicine. If that support does not become available, more children will die.  There are people in Haiti who are strongly opposed to the international community sending help in the form of police or military personnel. At the same time, as we have pointed out in this space before the obvious hesitance by some countries to offer help is most likely fuelled by the fact that Haiti hasn't been able to shake instability, and previous attempts at military aid in the form of boots on the ground have not gone well.  However, the situation there, correctly described as ""tragic"" by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres during a joint news conference with Jamaica's Prime Minister Andrew Holness on Monday at Jamaica House is untenable and has the potential of spilling over into the wider region.  Mr Holness also explained that it's not that the pleas from the UN and the Caribbean for help have fallen on deaf ears. ""The question,"" he said, ""is the pace of action, and countries who would want to support would also want to be assured that there is a political process in place that could yield an end result in a time frame that makes sense.""  That is not an unreasonable position.  A possible solution, we believe, is for a mediation team to get all players in the political conflict in Haiti involved in talks aimed at holding elections to install a legitimate Government. Naturally, those polls would require international observers to ensure transparency and acceptance of the results.  Additionally, a strategy to confront and dismantle the gangs is necessary.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmphbWFpY2FvYnNlcnZlci5jb20vZWRpdG9yaWFsL3RoaXMtZGlyZS1zaXR1YXRpb24taW4taGFpdGktaXMtdW50ZW5hYmxlL9IBWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmphbWFpY2FvYnNlcnZlci5jb20vZWRpdG9yaWFsL3RoaXMtZGlyZS1zaXR1YXRpb24taW4taGFpdGktaXMtdW50ZW5hYmxlL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"assassination","2023-05-13","22:00:00","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 21:15:24","Al Mayadeen analyst for Arab and regional affairs says despite the great wounds as a result of the Israeli aggression, Gazans decided to maintain steadfastness.  On Saturday at 10 pm Al-Quds time, an Egyptian-brokered ceasefire between the Palestinian Resistance and the Israeli occupation took effect following a five-day Israeli aggression against the Gaza Strip, which led to the martyrdom of 33 Palestinian and the injury of 100, in addition to huge material losses.  Immediately after the ceasefire was announced and took effect, Gazans took to the streets to celebrate victory in Operation Avenging the Free, which the Palestinian Resistance launched against the Israeli occupation in response to the latter's assassination of commanders and the brutal killing of civilians.  In conjunction with the celebrations, the Joint Operations Room of the Palestinian Resistance Factions in Gaza said Operation Avenging the Free is a new chapter of glory that the Resistance fought as a unified structure, warning that although the operation has ended, the banners of Resistance will not and shall not be lowered and the will to fight will not and shall not ever dwindle.  On his part, the Secretary-General of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) movement, Ziad Al-Nakhalah, said the Palestinian people, despite the pain, came out with their heads held high everywhere, in Gaza, the West Bank, and across the world, in support of the Resistance, describing these days as ""days of honor and dignity for our people, who, with simple resources, are facing all this aggression.""  One might wonder how the Palestinian Resistance and Gazans claimed a victory over the Israeli aggression, despite all the assassinations, killings, and destruction caused by the occupation.  Touching on the matter, Al Mayadeen analyst for Arab and regional affairs, Abdelrahman Nassar, pointed out that the main idea is to break the Israeli dictates, because ""Israel's"" goal behind the assassinations was to break the morale of the people.  Nassar explained that when Gazans witnessed the Resistance continuously bombing Israeli military sites, settlements, and cities and causing casualties among the Israelis until the last moment before the ceasefire entered into force, they considered the ceasefire a victory, steadfastness, and perseverance.  ""Simply rejecting Israeli dictates in this way is a victory,"" Nassar told Al Mayadeen English.  The Palestinian analyst indicated that despite the great wounds, Gazans decided to remain steadfast for many reasons, the most important of which is that they do not like to display their suffering in front of the Israeli occupation, considering all the difficult circumstances they have been under as part of the ongoing 15-year blockade on the Strip.  An upcoming assassination at any moment  Asked about the reason why “Israel” launched its heinous aggression against Gaza at this particular time, Nassar considered that the decision on the timing of the aggression was taken in 2022. He cited an Israeli Channel 14 report as saying that the security establishment confirmed the aggression on Gaza was not a response to the firing of 104 rockets toward ""Sderot"" in retaliation to Sheikh Khader Adnan’s martyrdom in Israeli occupation prisons, but rather a settling of accounts with the PIJ for each rocket launched since the beginning of the year and the movement’s role in Resistance operations in the occupied West Bank.  Nassar considered that ""Israel's"" concern is not the rocket firing from Gaza, since this matter is still unsolvable to the occupation, nor is it the PIJ's influential commanders, as there are similar influential leaders in other Palestinian factions. Rather, according to Nassar, ""Israel's"" problem is that the PIJ is at the forefront of the Resistance’s acts in the West Bank, and hence, the occupation tried to pressure the PIJ to prevent it from pursuing this progress. Therefore, the timing is just a factor related to field conditions and is mainly linked to the occupied West Bank, he noted.  Nassar cited another reason for the aggression -- a political factor related to the internal Israeli crisis over the judicial overhaul.  According to Nassar, ""Israel"" also tried to create a rift between the Palestinian Resistance factions and failed miserably as coordination between the factions was apparent during the aggression, and this is another aspect that boosted the morale of the people.  However, Nassar believed that from the present moment, ""Israel"" will continue to focus on the PIJ, predicting an upcoming assassination at any moment or a coming battle this year or the following.  Read more: Assassination of Resistance commanders not to end struggle: PIJ spox  Resistance rockets put “Israel” under constant anxiety  Militarily, Al Mayadeen analyst for Arab and regional affairs acknowledged that it would be unfair to compare the capabilities of the Israeli occupation and those of the Palestinian Resistance.  Nevertheless, he pointed out that were it not for the Resistance's rockets, ""the media would have broadcast the images of our martyrs, wounded, and destroyed homes from one side only, just as the situation was in 2010 and before.""  ""After 2012, when the Resistance began to put Israel under constant anxiety, the situation changed.""  He added that despite the Resistance not being able to inflict huge casualties, Israeli settlers assert that they ""love life"" and disrupting their daily lives and spreading fear among them through rocket firing is enough in the meantime.  According to Nassar, the Israelis are infamous for keeping secret their casualties in all confrontations against Lebanon and Palestine, be they military or not.  Read more: PIJ can manage the battle for long days: Israeli media  Israeli media admits no solution to Gaza challenge  Touching on the Israeli media's feedback on the recent aggression, Nassar pointed out that the media will not attack the occupation army directly. He mentioned that the Israeli media praised the army's performance but criticized that of the political establishment. However, he noted that the media admitted that ""Israel"" has not been able to find a solution to the Gaza challenge.  Nassar had previously touched on the path that was followed to reach a ceasefire. He asserted that the Palestinian Resistance's position was clear from the beginning, which is that it will not end this round unless it forces the Israeli occupation to stop the assassinations and targeting of its leaders and the bombing of homes and civilians.

"assassination","2023-05-16","Not Discerned","{""Washington"", ""DistrictOfColumbia"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 17:37:00","Film celebrates 50th anniversary of the first graduating class of the University’s Partnership Program  Washington, D. C., May 16, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- A documentary has been released telling the stories of Catholic University’s efforts to recruit and welcome Black students, especially from the Washington, D.C. area through its “Partnership Program.” Fifty years after the University’s first graduates of the Partnership Program — created in the wake of the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. — the documentary examines its founding, its struggles, and the progress being made to create a more diverse campus community.  Catholic University admitted 30 Black students mainly from the local area through the Partnership Program. To mark its success and the work that has been done, the University bestowed honorary doctoral degrees to the program's first directors, Leon LeBuffe and Thaddeus Aubry at the University-wide Commencement ceremony on May 13.  The documentary, No Longer Out of Reach, was directed and produced by award-winning filmmaker and journalist Chris Jenkins. The documentary features four of the program’s first participants along with Aubry and LeBuffe, both alumni, telling their stories. Additional voices from former students and archival footage complete the narrative about how Black students first faced significant struggles to get an education and how the University has been supporting the program since its founding in 1969. To screen the documentary, visit here .  “I can think of no better way to mark the 50th anniversary of the Partnership Program than to shine a light on its history, celebrate its accomplishments, and award honorary degrees to the program’s first directors, Leon LeBuffe and Thaddeus Aubry,” said Dr. Peter K. Kilpatrick, president of Catholic University. “Both of these extraordinary gentlemen offered their offices, homes, and time to students and were dedicated and welcoming.”  The Partnership Program has helped scores of Black students from the Washington metropolitan area attend Catholic University. In 1968, the year before the program started, there were seven Black undergraduates on campus. Now total undergraduate and graduate enrollment of Black students accounts for approximately 10% of the total student body.  Story continues  During LeBuffe and Aubry’s tenure, they personally mentored every matriculating program student — from their first days on campus through graduation. Even the few who ultimately did not complete the program benefited from their attention. This impact was felt so strongly and had such a profound impact on program graduates that the group established an endowed scholarship — the Thaddeus F. Aubry Jr. and Leon LeBuffe Scholarship — to honor their legacy and help current and future Black students at Catholic University through financial grants.  No Longer Out of Reach features four of the original 30 Black students admitted in 1969: Elvira Wise Smith, Ronny B. Lancaster, Andrea Cullins, and Kenneth Walker. The partners recount their experiences and journeys as Black students on Catholic University’s campus in the 70s. LeBuffe and Aubry discuss the role they played to bridge the gap and help students acclimate to the almost entirely white, and frequently unwelcoming, environment in which they found themselves.  ABOUT: The Catholic University of America is the national university of the Catholic Church and the only higher education institution founded by the U.S. bishops. Established in 1887 as a papally chartered graduate and research center, the University comprises 12 schools and 31 research facilities and is home to 5,000 undergraduate and graduate students.

"assassination","2023-05-14","Not Discerned","{""Jerusalem"", ""Jerusalem"", ""Israel""}","Wed 17 May 2023 06:18:00","In a message released on Tuesday on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Nakba Day, the Iranian president called it one of the most painful tragedies in human history.  The text of the message is as follows:  In the name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful  May 14, 1948 is a reminder of one of the most painful tragedies in human history. This ominous phenomenon caused the longest and saddest political and human crisis in the last one hundred years in the world and widespread insecurity in the West Asian region, the organized occupation and cruel usurpation of the Palestinian land, the killing of the oppressed Palestinians and the violation of the most obvious human rights of the original inhabitants of this holy land in 75 years.  Since the day that has been rightly named ""Nakba Day"", the Zionist regime has caused the displacement of millions of Palestinians, the targeted assassinations of Palestinian activists and ordinary people, the destruction of their homes, farms, and places of business and the violation of fundamental principles of international law, and it is obvious that the western supporters of this regime, especially the United States of America, are complicit in its crimes.  The Zionist regime continues its extreme and inhumane actions against the Palestinian people in the West Bank and the desecration of Islamic sanctities in the holy Quds in recent months, and in recent days, with a large-scale attack on various areas of the Gaza Strip, especially residential buildings, and targeted assassination of Palestinian citizens to escape from increasing and multi-layered internal crises.  These crimes, which have led to the martyrdom of dozens of civilians, including Palestinian women and children, are the concrete manifestation of state terrorism and mass murder, which has been the constant approach of this regime for the past 75 years.  For more than 18 years, the residents of the Gaza Strip have been living in the world's largest natural prison under cruel siege in a major humanitarian crisis. The continuation of the illegal and inhumane siege of the Gaza Strip and the ongoing crimes of the Zionist regime against the people of this region is a gross and obvious violation of the fundamental principles of international law, human rights and humanitarian rights, and unfortunately, the silence and inaction of the self-proclaimed human rights activists only lead to the arrogance of more than apartheid regime has been done before.  While strongly condemning the crimes of the Zionist apartheid regime against the Palestinian nation and the nations of the region, and while emphasizing the need for immediate, effective and deterrent action by the responsible international institutions, led by the United Nations, to stop the crimes of the Zionist regime and support the Palestinian nation, the Islamic Republic of Iran reiterates its solidity with this oppressed nation and emphasizes on supporting the cause and legitimate resistance of the Palestinian people in the path of liberating the occupied territories and forming an independent and unified government in the entire historical land of Palestine with the capital of the holy Quds.  At the end, I re-emphasize the Islamic Republic of Iran's democratic plan for the political solution of the Palestinian occupation crisis based on holding a public referendum with the participation of all the main inhabitants of the Palestinian land, including Muslims, Christians and Jews, in order to exercise the right to self-determination and to determine the type of political system.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhc25pbW5ld3MuY29tL2VuL25ld3MvMjAyMy8wNS8xNy8yODk1OTY0L2lyYW4tcy1wcmVzaWRlbnQtYnJhbmRzLW5ha2JhLWRheS1hLXRyYWdlZHktaW4taGlzdG9yedIBcGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhc25pbW5ld3MuY29tL2VuL25ld3MvMjAyMy8wNS8xNy8yODk1OTY0L2lyYW4tcy1wcmVzaWRlbnQtYnJhbmRzLW5ha2JhLWRheS1hLXRyYWdlZHktaW4taGlzdG9yeS9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","1963-11-22","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 01:43:38","Children of the '60s were very different from children in the '60s.  Flower children of the '60s on campus were changing the world with long hair and free spirits. They were the populous, rebellious Baby Boomers, born in post-World War II security and prosperity. The sun shone brightly on this huge wave, and they got all the attention.  As for us, born in the '60s, we were not so blessed. Even those born during President John F. Kennedy's Thousand Days don't remember the charmed ""Camelot"" era of culture and grace. That was a short chapter of history.  So, we didn't march on the streets as a way of life. We missed dancing on the streets in the Summer of Love. More soberly, youths coming of age were not drafted to fight in Vietnam as the war raged.  ""Gen X"" was too young to remember the crushing assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963, the central crack in the canyon of American memory.  There are differing definitions of the end of the Boomers; that is my lived experience of the gulf separating the earlier generation and mine.  Unifying experiences, sweet and bitter, shape the character of any generation.  As little kids, we didn't go to Woodstock. It was past our bedtime. The man landing on the moon seemed like a fairy tale, a perfect end to a turbulent time of our lives.  Every new day seemed exhilarating or tragic in that eventful decade. American children could not seek shelter from the storms of the '60s.  How I remember the ride's ups and downs: the rock 'n' roll of the Beatles, the folk protest songs of Bob Dylan and the shattering assassinations in 1968, 55 springs ago.  And I remember crying myself to sleep as a small child when the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., was slain in cold blood. Listening to the civil rights leader's resonant voice on the radio that cruel April fourth, how wrong it was that it would be heard no more.  I remember my father frozen in grief at the June murder of Bobby Kennedy that same spring. A young girl realizes, from reading older faces, that a calamity has happened — again.  There was no nursery rhyme or reason, Mommy and Daddy. They were helpers, I said.  The '60s had many moments like these as the Vietnam War went on... and on. Truly, it was all the adults talked and argued about. In Madison, Wisconsin, we bundled up for an anti-war protest or two. We sang a civil rights anthem or two.  I loved those songs and still know them by heart. Where have all the flowers gone?  As a family, we got caught up in the spirit of the '60s. We watched and trusted Walter Cronkite as the nation's storyteller. When Cronkite turned against President Lyndon B. Johnson's Vietnam War, here was one more trusted grown-up who doubted official Washington's words and actions on the war.  They could not all be wrong, right?  The end of the era gave us children in the '60s a badge as the first generation to watch and bear witness to a culture revolution against the government and social conventions.  The Baby Boomers, who grew up in the safe, conformist Eisenhower '50s, defied traditional authority as children of the '60s. They had all the fun, sometimes it seemed, and those were the days.  That generation gave us three presidents: Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and, um, Donald Trump. Two out of three Baby Bummers.  We children in the '60s have had one president, Barack Obama, born the summer of '61 during Kennedy's Thousand Days. He was better at brilliant campaigning in soaring speeches than governing, playing the card game of politics.  Obama felt getting knee deep in political bargains and compromises was slumming. He shunned the usual suspects — like House Democrats — in socializing at the White House. He did not ask citizens to do more for the country, as Kennedy did.  When we were getting braces, a president was forced to resign in 1974 after a corrupt cover-up. Our faith in government was further shaken.  I'd say Obama didn't meet great expectations. But then there's this: We lost our illusions and innocence young, even before we could vote.  Jamie Stiehm may be reached at JamieStiehm.com. Follow her on Twitter @JamieStiehm.

The groundbreaking commemorated a historic past and a future to become the dream today and tomorrow. The turn of the shovel is for the museum’s new Legacy Building and Founders Park renovations.  “Today is a momentous day at the National Civil Rights Museum for Memphis and for the state of Tennessee and for this country,” said Russ Wigginton, President of the National Civil Right Museum. “The renovations at Founders Park and the Legacy Building sets us up to be much more powerful in our messaging, many more educational opportunities for our visitors, and an opportunity for people to come to the National Civil Rights Museum and be inspired.”  The two-year project will focus on the museum’s campus west of Mulberry Street. It will expand the first floor of the historic boarding house including digital exhibitions and exhibits on Dr. King’s Poor People’s Campaign and the Freedom Award.  “We’ve (Blue Cross Blue Shield) invested 9.6 million dollars to reimagine this space for people to be able to come and reflect after visiting the museum. It’ll be an amazing space not just for Memphians, but people across the country,” said Kevin Woods, Blue Cross Blue Shield Vice President for the Memphis market.  The second-floor exhibitions will explore the Civil Rights Movement since Dr. King’s assassination and what has happened since those days.  “The legacy building will help address that. It will be thematic. It will talk about social justice issues that were central to Dr. King’s last “Where Do We Go From Here (book),” said Wigginton.  The third-floor exhibitions will examine how today’s activism impacts our communities and policies around poverty, education, jobs, housing, criminal justice, and gender equality as the National Civil Rights Museum looks back at the issues of the past and today.  “This museum will continue its critical role to tell our history, to inspire positive social change, and to give us all that special space,” said Blue Cross Blue Shield Board Chair Emily Reynolds.  The National Civil Rights Museum opened in 1991. It’s had more than 300,000 visitors and now expects the expansion in 2025 will mean half a million people visiting the museum every year.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3JlZy5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9uYXRpb25hbC1jaXZpbC1yaWdodHMtbXVzZXVtLWJyZWFrcy1ncm91bmQtb24tdHdvLXllYXItZXhwYW5zaW9uLXByb2plY3Qv0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93cmVnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL25hdGlvbmFsLWNpdmlsLXJpZ2h0cy1tdXNldW0tYnJlYWtzLWdyb3VuZC1vbi10d28teWVhci1leHBhbnNpb24tcHJvamVjdC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2023-05-16","Not Discerned","{""Jerusalem"", ""Jerusalem"", ""Israel""}","Tue 16 May 2023 10:16:20","In an interview with Channel 14 on Monday evening, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Israel would assassinate anybody who poses a threat to the upcoming flag march in occupied Jerusalem this week.  “We carried out assassinations not only in the Gaza Strip, but also in other places,” the prime minister told the Hebrew outlet, adding that “whoever provokes us on Jerusalem Day – his blood will be spilled.”  “We carried out assassinations in several arenas. All I can say is that we will not back down from this policy, but we will implement it at the appropriate time,” he added.  Netanyahu’s comments come despite the fact that Israel was said to have agreed to the resistance’s main term for the ceasefire announced on Saturday evening, an end to the Israeli ‘assassination policy’ against leaders of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) movement and other groups.  However, contradicting the alleged Egyptian, Qatari, and UN-drafted truce document – Israeli officials continue to claim that they made no such agreement.  “We will have zero tolerance for those who launch attacks against [us] … we will take direct and very painful measures directly against the heads of all organizations,” Netanyahu said.  Earlier on Monday, a member of Netanyahu’s government, Intelligence Minister Yisrael Katz, said: “The march of the flags will take place, as usual, every year without change, and that any organization that tries to harm it and fire missiles at us to prevent it, all its leaders will be on the elimination table, as we did with Islamic Jihad.”  This came after Palestinian sources told Al-Akhbar daily that – while a change in the course of the flag march was not included in the ceasefire terms as the PIJ had initially announced – the resistance would be keeping a watchful eye over Jerusalem and would respond appropriately to any provocation by “the occupation government and its extremists” during the flag march.  A journalist with close ties to Hamas, Mustafa al-Sawwaf, told Al-Akhbar that “things will turn upside down” if Israel goes ahead with Thursday’s ultra-nationalist march as planned.  Every year, the flag march falls on ‘Jerusalem Day,’ during which Israelis commemorate the illegal annexation of east Jerusalem during the 1967 war. The march is highly provocative given that it passes through the Muslim quarters of Jerusalem’s Old City where Al-Aqsa Mosque compound is located – with Israelis carrying their flags and chanting racist and derogatory slogans.  Acts of violence against Palestinians by settlers and accompanying Israeli troops are highly common throughout the annual flag march. During last year’s flag march, over 160 Palestinians were injured by Israeli troops and settlers.  Israel’s National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir – known for storming Al-Aqsa Mosque and aiming pistols at Palestinians in the street – will be attending the flag march.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlY3JhZGxlLmNvL2FydGljbGUtdmlldy8yNDg1My9pc3JhZWwtdGhyZWF0ZW5zLXZpb2xlbmNlLWlmLWZsYWctbWFyY2gtZGlzcnVwdGVk0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(Photo AFP)    ROME: Rome prosecutors have opened a fresh investigation into the disappearance of a teenager 40 years ago, and are calling for full collaboration from the Vatican, Italian media reported Monday.    Emanuela Orlandi, the 15-year-old daughter of a Vatican employee, was last seen leaving a music class in Rome on June 22, 1983.    Decades of speculation followed over what happened to her, with suggestions that mobsters, the secret services or a Vatican conspiracy were to blame, theories which sparked a hit Netflix series.    The Orlandi family's lawyer Laura Sgro told AFP Monday she had learned of the fresh probe through Italian media reports, and ""it would certainly be welcome news"".    The family has campaigned tirelessly for the truth, and it was their demands which led in part to the Vatican launching an inquiry into its most famous cold case in January.    Following that, ""Rome Public Prosecutor's Office is now also formally returning to investigate the Orlandi case,"" Italy's Corriere della Sera said.    It will be the third investigation by the Rome office, following ones from 1983-1997, and 2008- 2015.    'Seek the truth together'  The Vatican has been accused of obstructing investigation efforts over the decades.    But now its chief prosecutor Alessandro Diddi and Rome prosecutors led by Francesco Lo Voi ""are cooperating on the case"", the Repubblica daily said.    The Corriere said ""the hope is for 'full cooperation' -- an exchange of documents, depositions etc"".    The Vatican has interviewed clerics in recent weeks as part of its investigation, the paper added.    It would be ""the first time Italian and Vatican prosecutors work together to seek the truth"", Sgro said.    The fresh Italian investigation was driven in part by former prosecutor Giancarlo Capaldo's claims that he had spoken during the last probe to two representatives at the Vatican who had promised to reveal the whereabouts of Orlandi's body, the Corriere said.    One of the most widely circulated theories claims Orlandi was snatched by mobsters to put pressure on the Vatican to recover a loan.    Enrico De Pedis, head of the Magliana gang, was suspected of involvement in her kidnapping.    Another claim often repeated in the Italian media was that she was taken to force the release from prison of Mehmet Ali Agca, the Turk who attempted to assassinate Pope John Paul II in 1981.    The twists and turns of the case were documented in a 2022 TV series by Netflix, ""Vatican Girl"".    In it, a friend also claimed the teen confided the week before she disappeared to having been harassed in the Vatican gardens by a figure close to then pope John Paul II.--ucanews.com","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlcmFsZG1hbGF5c2lhLmNvbS9uZXdzL3JvbWUtc3RhcnRzLWZyZXNoLXByb2JlLWludG8tbWlzc2luZy12YXRpY2FuLXRlZW4vNzExMjcvMtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(Credit: AP Photo.)  Listen to this story:  ROME – After the Vatican opened an investigation last December and the Italian parliament is currently considering its own probe, the city of Rome too has announced a new inquest into the 1983 disappearance of Emanuela Orlandi, at the time the 15-year-old daughter of an employee of the Prefecture of the Papal Household whose family lived in a Vatican apartment.  Orlandi’s case recently was popularized by the Netflix series “Vatican Girl,” and most observers credit the flurry of new investigations, at least in part, to the heightened public interest created by the documentary.  The chief prosecutor of Rome, roughly equivalent to a district attorney in the United States, announced the new investigation this week. It will be the third such probe by the Roman procurator’s office in the 40 years since Orlandi disappeared. The first unfolded between 1983 and 1997, and the second from 2008 to 2015.  That second investigation was closed in 2015 by the chief prosecutor of Rome at the time, a veteran Italian jurist named Giuseppe Pignatone, who today serves as the president of the civil tribunal of the Vatican City State.  The Italian news agency Ansa reported Tuesday that the Vatican’s Promoter of Justice, Alessandro Diddi, has turned over files from his investigation to Stefano Luciani, the official in the Rome procurator’s office now responsible for the new Orlandi review.  Pietro Orlandi, the brother of Emanuela who’s devoted his life to the search for the truth about his sister’s disappearance, told reporters the Vatican’s cooperation with the Roman probe is a departure from the past.  “It’s positive that the Roman procurator has acquired the acts from the Vatican, because for the first time there will be collaboration, always denied in the past, between the Holy See and the [Italian justice system],” he said.  That’s a charge recently echoed by Giancarlo Capaldo, a retired Roman official who led the last investigation of the Orlandi case that was closed in 2015. In April, Capaldo told an Italian television program that in his experience there had been “no cooperation by Vatican with investigations of Italian magistrates.”  Among other things, Capaldo has claimed that in 2012 officials of the Vatican gendarmes offered to help identify Orlandi’s remains in exchange for assistance with removing the body of a mob boss who’d been entombed in a Roman basilica. Both officials involved have denied that claim, suggesting Capaldo misunderstood their intent.  The Vatican has always rejected charges of stonewalling investigations into the Orlandi case. In a 2012 statement from then-Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi, he insisted the Vatican has cooperated with Italian authorities from the start.  The 40th anniversary of Orlandi’s disappearance will fall next month, on June 22.  Veteran Italian journalist Fabrizio Peronaci, writing in Corriere della Sera, has suggested that the new probe of the Orlandi case by the procurator’s office could be combined with one already underway into the January 1984 murder of Katy Skerl, a 17-year-old girl at the time whose body was discovered in the countryside outside Grottaferrata, a small community southeast of Rome.  Over the years, some theorists have linked Skerl’s murder to the Orlandi case, noting, among other things, that Skerl was a classmate in a Roman high school of Snejna Vassilev, the daughter of one of three Bulgarian functionaries in Rome initially accused of complicity in the 1981 assassination attempt against Pope John Paul II.  Marco Accetti, a 67-year-old Roman photographer whose claims to have played a key role in the Orlandi affair have generated both interest and skepticism over the years, has asserted Skerl was killed on the order of a faction in the Vatican, opposed to the group which orchestrated the kidnapping of Orlandi, as part of an internal power struggle. To date, however, he’s offered no proof.  The Italian Chamber of Deputies voted overwhelmingly in March to authorize an inquest on behalf of parliament, and it seemed at the time the Senate would follow suit. Momentum stalled, however, after Pietro Orlandi went on Italian TV to play an audio recording of an ex-Roman mobster accusing the late Pope John Paul II of conniving in a pedophile ring in the Vatican, and suggesting that Emanuela Orlandi might have been killed to cover it up.  Those suggestions caused a furor, with Pope Francis twice publicly rejecting the charges against his predecessor. Key members of the senate have either withdrawn or modified their support for a probe in the wake of the controversy, with a vote now not expected until June at the earliest, and possibly after the summer.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vY3J1eG5vdy5jb20vdmF0aWNhbi8yMDIzLzA1L3ZhdGljYW4tY29vcGVyYXRlcy13aXRoLW5ldy1yb21lLXByb2JlLW9mLXZhdGljYW4tZ2lybC1jYXNlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"assassination","1965-02-21","Not Discerned","{""NewYork"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 12:40:14","Malcolm X helped lead the Nation of Islam until 1964. Truman Moore/Getty Images  May 2023 marks 98 years since the birth of civil rights leader Malcolm X, formerly Malcolm Little.  Malcolm X was a spokesperson for the Nation of Islam, or NOI, and helped to lead the organization until he left in 1964 – the year before his assassination.  The NOI, whose role in civil rights movements is a focus of my research, included leaders such as Elijah Muhammad and Louis Farrakhan, who along with Malcolm X are known for their fiery rhetoric and teachings on race.  The NOI, which teaches a Black supremacist message and advocates for racial separatism, has also been labeled a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.  While the organization once boasted half a million members, the group is now relatively small. Currently it has an estimated membership of roughly 35,000 – but prominent NOI members, such as boxer and onetime Malcolm X friend Muhammad Ali, attracted wide public interest in the movement. Today, its influence continues to extend well beyond its membership.  Although Malcolm X – and other prominent members like Ali – left the NOI, thousands of students each year learn about the group from Malcolm X’s “Autobiography,” originally published in 1965.  Malcolm X’s influence on popular culture also remains significant. He inspired a Hollywood biopic and is referenced in the work of artists such as Beyoncé, Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg, who was briefly associated with NOI.  Thanks largely to Malcolm X, the NOI is now a household name, but its teachings remain controversial, particularly among Muslims.  A radical alternative to Christianity?  W.D. Fard, a peddler by day and preacher by night, established the NOI in 1931 in Detroit, Michigan.  He taught that God was a Black man who taught the first human beings Islam. Accordingly, Fard framed Islam as “the natural faith” for people whose ancestors came from Africa, before colonization and slavery had forced Christianity onto them. He argued that Black people should abandon Christianity in favor of Islam as their ancestral religion.  Story continues  Fard also taught that Christianity was “the white man’s” religion and a corrupted form of Islam used to promote white supremacy. The message appealed to Black migrants from the South, who were sometimes looked down upon by Northern Black Protestants. Fard disappeared from the historical record in the mid-1930s.  Malcolm X and the NOI  Malcolm X joined the NOI while incarcerated in 1952. He became an international spokesman for the group, using his fierce wit and sense of humor to debate Black and white leaders on matters of race, religion and politics.  Malcolm X was suspended from the NOI in 1963 for his comments about President John F. Kennedy’s assassination. The following year, he renounced the NOI, converted to Sunni Islam, completed the hajj and formed a Black civil rights organization called the Organization of Afro-American Unit, or OAAU. This group sought to unite all Black people across the globe and conditionally accepted help from white people committed to Black freedom. The NOI, on the other hand, focused on the U.S. and refused all help from white Americans.  Malcolm X was assassinated on February 21, 1965, during an OAAU event in New York. The identity of his killers remains a mystery.  A new era  When Elijah Muhammad died in 1975, his son, Warith Deen Mohammed, transformed the NOI into the “World Community of al-Islam in the West.” He downplayed previous teachings about Black supremacy and aligned the movement closer to Sunni Islam. In 1977, however, a protégé of Elijah Muhammad’s and Malcolm X’s named Louis Farrakhan “restored” Elijah Muhammad’s Nation of Islam. Farrakhan assumed leadership of the group and emphasized Elijah’s teachings on race.  W.D. Fard, the NOI’s founder, and his successor Elijah Muhammad did not seem to know much about Sunni or Shiite Islam’s teachings. Fard did not cite the Quran to his followers, and Elijah Muhammad did not read the book until after assuming the NOI’s leadership.  As the group grew after World War II, Muhammad and other leaders became more familiar with mainstream Islamic tenets. They changed the name of their meeting places from “temples” to “mosques” and incorporated the Quran and Arabic phrases into their teachings and community organizing.  While the movement has changed its practices to align more closely with global expressions of Islam, many Muslims do not consider the NOI part of the Ummah, the global community of Muslims.  Not universally considered Muslim  The NOI’s unique theology is one of the reasons the group is not accepted into the Ummah.  Other forms of Islam maintain that God is eternal, nonhuman and singularly divine. The NOI, however, teaches that W.D. Fard was “God in person” who called Elijah Muhammad as his prophet.  Despite this significant deviation from mainstream forms of Islam, the NOI follows four of the five pillars of Islam: five daily prayers (salat), giving alms to the poor (zakat), pilgrimage to Mecca (hajj) and a month of fasting during Ramadan.  NOI Muslims did not practice Ramadan until 1988, when Farrakhan instructed members to fast “with the entire Islamic world.”  Changing attitudes?  That change led to opportunities for intra-Muslim cooperation but also underscored the limited acceptance of the NOI that continues among many other Muslim groups.  For example, in 2000, NOI members prayed with Houston Muslims during Ramadan, allowing the NOI to connect with other American Muslims.  However, these cross-Muslim events have not continued in Houston. Nor are they common elsewhere. The lack of sustained pan-Muslim events might suggest that, even when religious practice aligns, there remain obstacles to the building of relationships between mainstream and NOI Muslims.  While both the NOI and Malcolm X remain controversial, for many admirers X’s work has taken on new significance for today’s racial justice movements.

(READ: Filing of murder complaints vs Teves delayed as suspects get new lawyers)  Teves, who left the country purportedly for medical reasons prior to the assassination, has yet to return to the Philippines long after the March 20 deadline set by House Speaker Martin Romualdez.  Separate from the multiple murder complaint, the Department of Justice earlier said it was in the process of proscribing Teves as a terrorist.  Play Video  Remulla previously said the DOJ received intel that Teves was supposed to return home on Wednesday.  Teves told News 5 earlier on Wednesday that this was “fake news.”  The justice secretary said that if Teves refused to return home, it would be an indication of guilt. “Flight is an indication of guilt, by any language, jurisdiction,” Remulla said.  Whether or not Teves returns home, the preliminary investigation will continue, the secretary explained.  Teves cannot file his counter-affidavit in absentia, but he can be charged in absentia.  “He has to come home, or they will file the case in court, and a warrant will be issued in absentia,” Remulla said.  In reaction to the filing of cases against Teves, his lawyer Ferdie Topacio told CNN Philippines, “it’s about time.”  “Kung ang sinasabi ni Secretary Remulla gusto niyang airtight, lalo hindi naging airtight. Kasi, nabalitaan ko nga through various news outlets, meron recantation ang thrust ng ilang sinasabi nilang testigo nung March 31 pa. Sinasabi nila 99.9% solved. Pagdating ng April 4, sabi nila solid daw ang testimonial evidence against Congressman Teves, ayan, may mga recantations pala,” Topacio said, casting doubt on the DOJ’s case build-up.  (If Secretary Remulla is saying they waited so long to make the case airtight, the more it isn’t airtight. Because we found out through various news outlets, there was a thrust toward recantations, from witnesses they said who testified last March 31. They said it is 99.9% solved. Then came April 4, they said the testimonial evidence against them was solid, but there are recantations.)  Why it matters  While political killings continue to happen in the Philippines, it’s rare that a sitting governor is assassinated in broad daylight in his own home by what appears to be highly trained gunmen.  Aside from the method in Degamo’s killing, there were nine others killed and 16 injured that day – all civilians. Another civilian died on May 6, bringing the death toll to 10.  Degamo’s killing also brought national attention to the long-running problem of unsolved killings in Negros Island. It has stirred conversations on ending impunity and protecting human rights in Negros Oriental, issues that were rarely talked about in the province.  The Senate committee on dangerous drugs and public order held marathon hearings to investigate the Degamo assassination and other killings in Negros Oriental from April 17 to 19, and from May 10 to 11. They heard dozens of families of victims of unsolved killings, survivors, and cops who were used to be assigned to or currently serving in Negros Oriental.  The Senate investigation concluded on May 11 after five sessions. – Rappler.com","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhcHBsZXIuY29tL25hdGlvbi9uYmktZmlsZXMtbXVyZGVyLWNvbXBsYWludHMtYXJuaWUtdGV2ZXMtcm9lbC1kZWdhbW8ta2lsbGluZy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Advertising Read more  Some 24,000 security personnel are reportedly being deployed to Hiroshima during the summit, most dispatched from other parts of the country.  Well ahead of the May 19-21 talks, patrolling police have been weaving between tour groups in the western city's famed Peace Park.  Security personnel were also motoring up and down the river that runs alongside sites like the Atomic Bomb Dome, with helicopters regularly buzzing overhead.  The measures have extended far beyond the city, including to the capital Tokyo, where messages on the train system warn of heightened security for the summit.  Major cities in Japan do not generally have rubbish bins in public places, but security personnel have been sealing off other places considered to pose a potential threat.  Coin lockers, which are common in many stations, have been put out of operation at major stations as far afield as Tokyo.  Security personnel are even patrolling by boat in Hiroshima before the G7 summit © Richard A. Brooks / AFP  Vending machines on subway platforms have also been unplugged and sealed with tape, along with apologetic signs warning they will be unavailable during the summit for security reasons.  In Hiroshima, signs across the city and in hotels remind locals and tourists alike that the summit will cause disruption, including the closure of streets and access to the island of Miyajima, which leaders are expected to visit.  'Inconvenience understandable'  Dozens of schools and other institutions have simply opted to close during the summit, according to local media.  But Yoshinari Kakei, who was out walking his dog in the Peace Park early Wednesday evening said he was ""grateful"" for the heavy security.  ""Inconvenience and limitations are understandable. We will just live with that during this period,"" the 52-year-old told AFP.  The measures are likely to be closely scrutinised less than a year after a gunman assassinated former prime minister Abe as he campaigned in the city of Nara.  Then in April, a man hurled an explosive device towards Prime Minister Fumio Kishida shortly before he was due to deliver a campaign speech in the city of Wakayama.  Police are patrolling across the city, which is expecting major disruptions while leaders are in town © Philip FONG / AFP  He escaped unharmed, but the fact that an assailant was able to throw the device at such close range so soon after the Abe murder prompted renewed criticism of security arrangements in Japan.  The head of Japan's National Police Agency, and the local police chief, resigned in the wake of Abe's assassination after an investigation confirmed ""shortcomings"" in the security for the former leader.  The investigation slammed a system under which local police were given responsibility for the security of visiting senior officials and argued that with better measures, it was ""highly probable"" the attack could have been prevented.  Kishida has instructed police to step up security around the G7 ""so that guests can visit Japan with peace of mind"".

"assassination","2023-05-16","Not Discerned","{""MexicoCity"", ""DistritoFederal"", ""Mexico""}","Tue 16 May 2023 21:16:00","Mexico City, Mexico, May 16, 2023 (venezuelanalysis.com) – Venezuelan opposition figures reportedly conspired with Colombian paramilitaries to stage a coup d’etat and assassinate President Hugo Chávez.  Former paramilitary leader Salvatore Mancuso made the revelations during his testimony to Colombia’s Special Jurisdiction for Peace on Thursday.  “At one point a Venezuelan general came along with his son and some Venezuelan politicians to propose Carlos Castaño and I [...] that we carry out a coup d'état with a part of the Venezuelan Armed Forces allied with us to overthrow and assassinate Hugo Chávez,” Mancuso told the tribunal.  Mancuso, together with Carlos Castaño, led the the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC by its Spanish acronym), a former paramilitary group with ties to the Colombian Armed Forces that fought the country’s guerrilla armies, waging a violent campaign in the countryside that claimed thousands of victims.  The paramilitary chief was testifying before the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP by its Spanish acronym), a tribunal established as part of a peace agreement between the Colombian state and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) in 2016. Mancuso delivered his testimony via video from a prison inside the United States after being extradited in 2008 to face drug trafficking charges.  Mancuso, who seeks to return to Colombia, faces a long series of serious charges related to his time as a leader of the AUC. People involved in the country’s decades-long armed conflict who participate in JEP tribunals are eligible to receive special consideration, including reduced sentences, if their testimony is found to be truthful.  The work of the Special Jurisdiction for Peace has grown in prominence as Colombian President Gustavo Petro seeks to implement what his government has termed “Total Peace” in the country after his conservative predecessor deliberately sidelined peace efforts. The AUC itself formally demobilized between 2003 and 2006 as part of a separate deal promoted by former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe, which was criticized for being too accommodating to the paramilitary groups and leaders.  In his testimony to the JEP, Mancuso added that Castaño rejected the Venezuelan opposition proposal but nonetheless offered to send AUC troops to train their Venezuelan counterparts to carry out the coup. In 2004, a group of 50 Colombian paramilitaries was caught in an estate outside Caracas with an alleged plot to assassinate Chávez, who was elected in 1998 and served as president until his death from cancer in 2013.  Mancuso’s claim bolsters accusations of collaboration and coordination between Venezuela’s hardline opposition and paramilitary groups on both sides of the border. Self-proclaimed former “interim president” Juan Guaidó and his allies faced heavy criticism after photos emerged of the opposition figure embracing high ranking members of Colombia’s Los Rastrojos after he crossed from Venezuela into Colombia to participate in US-led effort to force “humanitarian aid” across the border in 2019.  Former US National Security Advisor John Bolton later revealed that the so-called aid scheme was indeed an effort to try to embarrass Maduro and trigger a break in the armed forces, as Venezuelan government officials had denounced.  Guaidó again illegally entered Colombia last month as part of an effort to sabotage an international conference on Venezuela hosted by Petro. It was not clear if he relied on the help of armed actors in the border region once more. Guaidó eventually fled Colombia for Miami and subsequently held meetings with US politicians from both sides of the aisle who reiterated their support for him and Venezuela’s hardline opposition.  Petro has similarly denounced a coup plot by former Colombian security officials, mercenaries and paramilitary outfits. Retired state security officials and reservists staged a protest against the Colombian president’s security policies last Wednesday, with some openly calling for his ouster. Human rights activists in Colombia have long denounced the closeness between Colombian state security forces and paramilitary outfits.  Colombian mercenaries are also accused of involvement in the 2021 assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moïse, with 18 Colombians, many of them former soldiers, having been arrested in connection with Moïse’s killing. The assassination is suspected of being organized with the help of a Florida-based security firm.  In 2020, Venezuela foiled an effort by a 60-man paramilitary force organized by US special operations veteran Jordan Goudreau and retired Venezuelan Major General Cliver Alcalá to infiltrate the country via Colombia with the aim of assassinating Maduro.  The plot, known as “Operation Gideon”, counted on the support and blessing of high-profile Venezuelan opposition figures, despite denials from Guaidó. Goudreau has produced evidence showing the opposition hired his Florida-based security company Silvercorp and has sued anti-government operators for breach of contract.  Mancuso additionally testified that the AUC buried at least 200 bodies in mass graves inside Venezuelan territory in the early 2000s. The former paramilitary chief said that practice emerged after communities inside Colombia started to speak out against the incineration of victims in crematoriums as part of an effort to disappear bodies. Following Mancuso’s claims, Colombia and Venezuela announced that the two countries had agreed to “immediately” work together to help find the remains.

"assassination","2023-05-21","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 12:00:38","KASHMIR NEWS TRUST #KNT  Police claimed to have solved the assassination case of Mirwaiz Molvi Farooq.  Addressing a press conference on Tuesday ADGP R K Swain said that out of 4 accused involved in the assassination of Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, two were killed in the encounters and two others on the run were arrested and handed over to CBI who will now face trial.  He identified the two arrested accused as Javaid Ahmed Bhat alias late Habibullah, a resident of Solina, presently living at Azad Basti Natipora and Zahoor Ahmed Bhat son of Muhammad Ramzan, of Dandarkha Batamaloo.  “Four persons were involved in the killing. All the four were run. Two accused Abdullah Bangroo and Rehman Shigan were killed in the encounter. The two other accused Javaid and Zahoor went to Pakistan and then Nepal and were finally arrested and handed over to CBI and now they will face the trial,” he said adding that Zahoor was the main accused.  He said one accused Ayoub Dar has been already facing conviction in this case registered at Police Station Nigeen and then the same case was handed over to CBI. “His conviction was challenged in the Supreme Court but the court upheld the conviction.”  Meanwhile, police have issued a detailed press statement claiming that SIA of J&K Police has tracked & arrested two absconding militants involved in killing of Mirwaiz Farooq and both the militants have been handed over to CBI to face trial.    Police said that 5 militants were involved in the killing. Abdullah Bangroo & Rehman Shigan had got killed in encounters and couldn’t face trial. Ayub Dar underwent trial and convicted for life, currently serving sentence in Srinagar central jail. Javaid Bhat & Zahoor Bhat were absconding and hence escaped trial and they both have been apprehended. The duo had gone underground and during all these years were variously hiding in Nepal and Pakistan among other places before surreptitiously returning back to Kashmir a few years ago. Maintaining a low profile, changing addresses and shifting residences, they avoided the gaze of law enforcement agencies.  Accused in CBI case RC0501990S008 (pertaining to killing of Mirwaiz Farooq) they are now liable to immediately face trial in a designated TADA court in Delhi which has already completed the trial in respect of one of the five accused namely Ayub Dar code Ishfaq son of Late Abdul Ahad Dar of Rawalpora of Srinagar who has been convicted and serving a life sentence. Two other absconding accused found guilty in the killing of Mirwaiz, Abdullah Bangroo and Abdul Rehman Shigan, got killed in encounters with security forces in the 1990s.  According to police statement, on 21 May 1990, Mirwaiz Farooq, the head priest of Kashmir was killed by militants of Hizbul Mujahideen accusing him of being a ‘peacenik’ and an ‘Indian agent’.  Case FIR No 61/1990 came to be registered in Police Station Nageen, Srinagar to investigate the crime. Thereafter the government of the day transferred the investigation to CBI on 11 June 1990.  After a long and arduous legal process of investigation and prosecution, the designated TADA court, in 2009, convicted the only arrested accused Ayub Dar for life. The remaining four remained on run. While two (Abdullah Bangroo & Rehman Shigan) died in encounters, Javaid Bhat and Ayub Bhat managed to evade arrest.    Ayub Dar, the convicted militant and one of the killers appealed against his conviction, which however, was upheld by the Division Bench of Supreme Court in Criminal Appeal No.535 of 2009 on 21 July 2010.  Before killing Mirwaiz, all the five HM militants had gone to Pakistan for militant training in 1990. Back in Srinagar, Abdullah Bangroo received instructions in April 1990 from his ISI handler in Pakistan to eliminate Mirwaiz.    Paraphrased excerpts from Supreme Court order:  In the year 1990 itself, in the month of April, accused Abdullah Bangroo, Javed Ahmed Bhat alias Ajmal Khan and Mohd. Ayub Dar alias Ishfaq, who belongs to Hizbul Mujahideen, entered into a criminal conspiracy to eliminate Mirwaiz Moulvi Farooq. Accused Abdulla Bangroo, who was then heading Hizbul Mujahideen, instructed Javed Ahmed Bhat alias Ajmal Khan and Mohd. Ayub Dar alias Ishfaq to plan elimination of Mirwaiz Moulvi Farooq. Javed Ahmed Bhat alias Ajmal Khan was then working as an Area Commander of Hizbul-Mujahideen in the downtown area of Srinagar; whereas the Javed was working as a Group Commander in that very area. Later on, Abdul Rehman Shigan alias Inayat and Zahoor Ahmed alias Bilal also joined the conspiracy. It came out in the investigation that, in the second week of May, 1990, under the instructions of Javed Ahmed Bhat alias Ajmal Khan, Mohd. Ayub Dar alias Ishfaq and Abdul Rehman Shigan alias Inayat had visited the residence of Moulvi Farooq at Nageen, Srinagar and had requested him for financial help to their militant organization i.e. Hizbul Mujahideen. Moulvi Farooq had agreed to help them and had asked them to meet after 2/3 days during the morning hours. Thereafter, two accused surveyed the area as per their plan and informed the details to Javed Ahmed Bhat alias Ajmal Khan. It was on 21.05.1990 that the three accused namely Mohd Ayub Dar alias Ishfaq , Abdul Rehman Shingan alias Inayat and Zahoor Ahmed alias Bilal alias Jana armed with loaded pistol visited the `Mirwaiz Manzil’ at Nageen. Accused Javed Ahmed Bhat alias Bilal had instructed the appellant that, out of the three accused persons, Zahoor Ahmed alias Bilal would fire on Moulvi Farooq and the remaining two accused persons namely Ayub Dar and Abdul Rehman Shingan were to provide cover to Zahoor Ahmed alias Bilal.  As per the plan, they all reached the gate of Mirwaiz Manzil and met Maqbool Shah, the gate-keeper and informed him that they wanted to meet Moulvi Farooq. Maqbool Shah then asked Gulam Qadir Sofi, the gardener, to take them to the Personal Assistant as he himself was going to the market.  Accordingly, the gardener – Ghulam Qadir Sofi took the three to the Personal Assistant namely Saidur Rehman , who asked them about their names and one of them disclosed his fake name as Gulzar Farooq R/o. Batmaloo. That name was written by the Personal Assistant on a slip of paper and the said slip was sent inside the room of Moulvi Farooq through the gardener Ghulam Qadir Sofi. After sometime, Moulvi Farooq called the three accused inside the Office, on which Zahoor Ahmed alias Bilal entered the room of Moulvi Farooq and the remaining two accused persons including Javed Bhat took position in the PA’s room. On entering the room of Moulvi Farooq, Zahoor Ahmed alias Bilal fired several rounds on Moulvi Farooq from his pistol and immediately, accused Inayat also fired from his pistol in the air while coming out of PA’s room, which hit the outside wall of the Office. On hearing the sound of firing, the gardener came inside the Office and tried to catch hold of Ishfaq, who was trying to escape.  However, all the accused persons escaped giving a push to the Gardener Ghulam Qadir Sofi. Accused Bilal also tried to run away, but he was caught by Ghulam Qadir Sofi. There was a scuffle between the two, in which Bilal sustained an injury below his right eye. Later, after firing one round from his pistol, Bilal also managed to escape. The accused persons ran towards Kashmir University, who were followed by Ghulam Qadir Sofi upto the main road and near the University Gate, the assailants ran towards Soura through the University compound and reached Chatargam in the afternoon of 21.05.1990. They then reported killing of Moulvi Farooq to Abdulla Bangroo. All the three accused persons were directed by Abdullah Bangroo, to go underground for sometime.  During trail running for several years, it could be established that the militant who pulled the trigger on Mirwaiz Farooq on the fateful day on the directions of then HM commander Abdullah Bangroo was Zahoor Bhat who ironically succeeded in evading arrest by going into hiding.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vbmV0d29ya2tudC5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS9wb2xpY2UtaXNzdWVzLXN0YXRlbWVudC1hYm91dC10aGUtYXNzYXNzaW5hdGlvbi1jYXNlLW9mLW1pcndhaXotbW9sdmktZmFyb29xL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Kennedy.  “I released a lot, as you know. And I will release everything else,” former Trump said of the JFK files, in an interview Monday with The Messenger.  This comes after Robert F. Kennedy Jr., nephew of the late President Kennedy, blamed the CIA for his uncle’s assassination in 1963.  The Democratic presidential candidate made the controversial remarks during an interview with John Catsimatidis on his WABC 770 AM show Cats Roundtable in early May.  “I think there is overwhelming evidence that the CIA was involved in his murder,” Kennedy said.  “I think it’s beyond reasonable doubt at this point,” he said. “The evidence is overwhelming that the CIA was involved in the murder and in the cover-up.”  The President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 states that government records concerning the death of JFK “should be eventually disclosed to enable the public to become fully informed about the history surrounding the assassination.”  During Trump’s time in office, he released some documents but not all the records.  In a statement released in 2018, Trump said, “I agree with the Archivist’s recommendation that the continued withholdings are necessary to protect against identifiable harm to national security, law enforcement, or foreign affairs that is of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest in immediate disclosure.”  “I am also ordering agencies to re-review each of those redactions over the next three years,” he said.  About 4,300 records remain redacted, according to the CIA.  When interviewed by The Messenger, Trump was asked about whether the public has anything to worry about if the records harm America’s international reputation.  “Well, I don’t want to comment on that. But I will tell you that I have released a lot. I will release the remaining portion very early in my term,” Trump said.

"assassination","2023-05-16","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 17:57:01","May 16, 2023  A member of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq’s parliament said he survived an assassination attempt on Monday, though a Kurdish military commander later disputed the account. The ordeal occurred amid tensions and dialogue between the two main Kurdish parties in northern Iraq.  What happened: Karwan Gaznay, a member of the Kurdistan parliament for the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), said in a tweet on Tuesday that he ""survived an assassination attempt” the night prior. His driver was injured and they are “waiting for the reaction of the government,” per the tweet.  The incident took place in the town of Koya located in Erbil province. It is under investigation, according to the PUK-affiliated Esta news agency.  The Kurdish news outlet NRT, which is affiliated with the opposition New Generation party, reported that the shooting occurred around 10 p.m. local time on Monday at a checkpoint manned by Kurdish internal security forces known as Asayish.    NRT later reported on Wednesday that Zana Khalid, a commander in the region's peshmerga forces, disputed Gaznay's account of the incident. Khalid, an affiliate of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), said the confrontation occurred when Gaznay's vehicle crashed into his own vehicle and Gaznay's driver began hurling insults.  Sulaimaniyah province is controlled by the PUK, while Erbil province is controlled by the KDP. The KDP is the largest party in the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), followed by the PUK. Koya, where the shooting occurred, is close to the border separating the two parties’ territories.  Why it matters: The shooting occurred at a time of significant tensions between the KDP and the PUK. Tensions between the two parties are not new but were raised significantly in October when PUK counterterrorism officer Hawkar Jaf was killed in a car bombing in Erbil.  The current tensions have multiple dimensions. One area where the two parties disagree is over energy policy, specifically the KRG’s independent oil exports, according to Aras Masifi, an independent Kurdish blogger.  “The PUK believes it has had little say and involvement in the KRG's oil policy in recent years,” Masifi told Al-Monitor. “That is why the PUK advocates a common uniform energy policy with Baghdad in the hope of being able to have more say and participation in Baghdad.”  The tensions over oil have worsened since the March decision by the Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce that ruled Turkey had to pay damages to Iraq for accepting unauthorized oil imports from the Kurdistan Region. The decision relates to the Baghdad-based federal government’s efforts to exert its authority over the KRG’s independent oil sector. Much of the region’s oil is in KDP territory.  “Especially after the Paris court decision, the PUK has become louder and clearer in its pro-Baghdad rhetoric,” said Masifi.  The KDP currently holds the positions of prime minister and president in the KRG, while senior PUK member Qubad Talabani is deputy prime minister. The tensions also relate to the division of power within the KRG, according to Masifi.  “(Talabani) believes he has little power to fill government posts. But the PUK would also like more autonomy from the KDP/Erbil when it comes to the budget and procurement law for large construction projects,” he said.  The two parties have also been fighting over the region’s election laws and when to hold parliamentary elections, which are now scheduled to take place in November. PUK officials stopped attending KRG Cabinet meetings last December due to the tensions, according to the KDP-affiliated news outlet Rudaw.  The assassination attempt on Syrian Kurdish leader Mazlum Kobane in Sulaimaniyah last month further exacerbated tensions between the two parties. Kobane blamed Turkey for the attack, though the country denied this. The KDP is historically close to Turkey, while the PUK has good relations with Kobane’s Syrian Democratic Forces, as well as the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). The PUK blamed the KDP for the attack on Kobane, Amberin Zaman reported for Al-Monitor at the time.  The attack on Gaznay is not the first to occur amid these tensions. NRT reported a “noticeable rise” in shootings, kidnappings and physical assaults during the month of April. The outlet pointed to the assault of Erbil-based lawyer Mohammed Sofi and the killing of KDP official Abdullah Kuekha Mubarak’s son, among other incidents.  “Tensions between the two ruling parties of the Kurdistan Region have provided opportunities for some to settle scores, exploiting the deteriorating security situation,” NRT reported.  A particularly high number of political assassinations have occurred in Sulaimaniyah since 2021.  Know more: The intra-Kurdish tensions in Iraq could dissipate soon. On Sunday, PUK ministers returned to the Cabinet meetings. The Cabinet promptly passed a measure to centralize revenues, expenditures and salaries across the region. This had been a demand of the PUK, according to Rudaw.  On Tuesday, PUK and KDP political leaders met again in Sulaimaniyah to discuss the November elections.

"assassination","1995-11-05","Not Discerned","{""Jerusalem"", ""Jerusalem"", ""Israel""}","Tue 16 May 2023 21:26:00","The political leaders, defense establishment and much of the public appear to have found a new-old love: targeted assassinations. This is the obvious conclusion from all the pride and boasting about the assassination of six top Islamic Jihad commanders. If this is the main accomplishment of Operation Shield and Arrow, then Israeli policy toward the Palestinians, and on Gaza in particular, is in quite a sorry state.  Once upon a time, the defense establishment – the Mossad, Shin Bet and IDF – held an ambivalent attitude toward the use of assassinations as a tool for fighting the enemy, whether enemy countries or terrorist groups, and the tactic was always considered a last resort.  The first targeted assassination was carried out by Israel in 1956, when Unit 154 (today Unit 504) of army intelligence, which ran agents on Israel’s borders, sent a package bomb into Gaza that killed Colonel Mustafa Hafez, an Egyptian intelligence officer who dispatched fedayeen cells into Israel.  In the 1960s, there were several assassination operations by the Mossad – against German scientists who aided Egypt’s armaments program, and against Herberts Cukurs, a Nazi war criminal known as the “Butcher of Riga.” A Mossad cell assassinated him in 1965 in Montevideo, Uruguay.  After the Six-Day War, the intelligence community resumed using targeted assassinations, but only sparingly. The Mossad sent cells of fighters to assassinate Palestinian terrorists in Europe in response to terror attacks against Jewish and Israeli targets abroad, like the murder of the Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972.  In the same era, Shin Bet operatives were operating in the West Bank and Gaza, either directly or indirectly through Palestinian agents. In the 1970s, and to a greater degree following the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, Israel also began assassinating Palestinian and Hezbollah militants.  Open gallery view A child carrying a poster of Hezbollah commander Imad Mughniyeh during his Beirut funeral in 2008. Credit: Reuters  But the big change in the targeted assassination policy came in the wake of the second intifada, when Avi Dichter was leading the Shin Bet. The tactic became very widely used. Hundreds of militants were assassinated by a variety of methods, and the latest technologies were incorporated in the effort – such as drones and, later, suicide drones.  Occasionally, radical proposals were suggested during discussions at the highest political and military levels, such as targeting Iraqi ruler Saddam Hussein for assassination. This was after the 1991 Gulf War in which 39 Scud missiles were fired at Israeli cities. The preparations for this operation, for which Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin likely would not have given final approval in any case, were halted in the wake of the Tze’elim disaster in which five Sayeret Matkal fighters were killed during training for the operation.  But Israel has never determined whether targeted assassinations are an effective policy that serves a worthy purpose, or merely the result of a desire for vengeance. Fifty years ago, after Mossad agents shot and killed a Moroccan waiter in Lillehammer, Norway in a case of mistaken identity, there was urgent discussion in the security establishment about whether the assassination tactic should continue to be used. David Kimche, the future deputy Mossad chief, told me at the time that the Mossad should not be in the business of assassinating enemies because “We’re not a mafia, we’re not Murder, Inc.”  The first and only attempt to seriously address this issue was by a subcommittee of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee following the failed assassination attempt of Hamas official Khaled Meshal in Amman in 1997. Members of the subcommittee that investigated the failed operation included Yossi Sarid, Benny Begin, Ori Orr and Uzi Landau. Much of its report, in which it attempted to formulate something like a “targeted assassinations doctrine” – when, under what circumstances, and against whom this tactic should be used – remains classified.  The committee, as well as outside experts, appear to have basically agreed that assassinations, particularly outside of Israel, are only appropriate in exceptional circumstances. The most prominent example of this is the assassination, attributed to the Mossad and CIA, of Hezbollah “defense minister” Imad Mughniyeh by a car bomb in Damascus in 2008. Since then, Hezbollah has struggled to find a worthy replacement for Mughniyeh, who was considered especially skilled in devising terrorist operations throughout the Middle East, not only against Israeli targets.  In its concluding remarks, the 1997 subcommittee wrote, “Over the years, Israel’s governments have not clearly formulated a policy for combating terrorist organizations that is based on rigorous thought and consistent logic. In the absence of a clear doctrine for anti-terrorist activity, the component of response to terror attacks has taken on great and damaging weight.” Evidently, none of Israel’s governments over the past quarter-century have read this spot-on assessment, or if they did, they immediately forgot it.  One way this may be seen is in the series of assassinations of Iranian nuclear scientists that are attributed to the Mossad since 2009, the most recent being the 2019 assassination of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, Iran’s top nuclear scientist.  But it's even more apparent in the policy Israel has employed in recent years in successive operations in Gaza. From one operation to the next, as Israel’s frustration mounts, so does the blind faith and stagnant thinking that targeted assassinations will solve the problem. For some ministers and security chiefs, targeted assassination have become the ultimate method and a substitute for a real strategy.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oYWFyZXR6LmNvbS9vcGluaW9uLzIwMjMtMDUtMTcvdHktYXJ0aWNsZS1vcGluaW9uLy5wcmVtaXVtL2lzcmFlbHMtdGFyZ2V0ZWQtYXNzYXNzaW5hdGlvbnMtYXJlLWEtcG9vci1zdWJzdGl0dXRlLWZvci1hLXN0cmF0ZWd5LzAwMDAwMTg4LTI1YWYtZDE4Yi1hNzlkLTI1ZmZiMTRjMDAwMNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

One of her last gifts to John was a sweet little puppy dog, an animal he swore to cherish. When some brash Russian gangsters kill the dog in a fit of violent pique, it more or less drags John Wick back into the violent underground he once occupied, eager to lay waste to anyone who wronged him. One dead dog = 10,000 dead gangsters and assassins. The equation makes perfect sense.  To add some texture to the premise, however, screenwriter Derek Kolstad invented a fascinating notion.

Heretofore, that commission had been composed entirely of cardinals.

Pretty much everyone you meet has a theory about JFK being shot in Dallas in 1963.  One of the most popular theories that’s floated is that the mafia plays a role. The two motivating factors for this theory is Kennedy didn’t do enough to get their assets in Cuba back or the mob was involved as a reaction to the crackdowns, despite allegedly helping him in Illinois.  I’m not saying either of those are true or you should believe it. Those are simply popular theories.

Protests against the decision to release him are also planned in Islamabad  Lahore (Pakistan) (AFP) – Several thousand pro-government protesters demanded Monday the resignation of Pakistan's top judge for releasing Imran Khan from arrest last week, as the former prime minister went back to court facing yet more legal cases.  Advertising Read more  Khan, who was ousted from power in April last year, was arrested on corruption charges on Tuesday following months of simmering political crisis, prompting his voters to rampage through cities.  His arrest was declared unlawful by the Supreme Court's chief justice and Khan was later released and granted various protective bail applications.  ""The chief justice and a few of his cronies are disgracing the judiciary like never before. Their justice seems to be serving one leader only,"" said Malik Hassam Mehmood, a 36-year-old trader and supporter of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's party.  ""We are here to protest for the rule of law and a non-partisan judiciary.""  There was a heavy security presence in the capital on Monday as protesters gathered outside the court in the capital's so-called red zone.  The Supreme Court order said Khan's arrest last week as he arrived at the Islamabad High Court to file a bail application in the graft case ""violated the petitioner's right of access to justice"".  However, referring to the pro-government protesters, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah said on Sunday that ""people want to come in very large numbers because of a deep sense of anger and anguish"".  Analysts say legal hurdles are often used to discourage dissent in Pakistan and Khan dismisses the cases arrayed against him as politically motivated.  Political analyst Mosharraf Zaidi said judges were split down the middle over the political crisis.  ""The judiciary still makes compromises with both civilians and the military, but on many issues judges have repeatedly demonstrated the ability to take a stand and hold their ground,"" he told AFP.  Tussle with military  Former international cricket star Khan returned to the Lahore High Court on Monday, where his lawyers said they were seeking information on fresh cases linking him to the violence that followed his arrest. The case will continue Tuesday.  Khan was accompanied by his wife, Bushra Bibi, who was granted protective bail in the same corruption case that led to the former leader's arrest.  Their team erected a white curtain between their vehicle and the courtroom to shield the couple from the media.  At least nine people were killed, hundreds of police officers injured and more than 7,000 people detained in last week's unrest before Khan was released on bail on Friday, authorities said.  Sanaullah, who has vowed Khan will be rearrested, told reporters on Sunday the ""terrorism and mobbing was all preplanned and this was done by Khan"".  Elections are due no later than October and Khan has held a series of vastly popular marches challenging the authority of the shaky coalition of parties that replaced him.  He has also waged an unprecedented campaign of defiance against Pakistan's army, which has ruled for nearly half of Pakistan's 75-year history and continues to wield massive influence.  When Khan surged into office in 2018, most understood it was with the backing of the generals. Analysts likewise said when he left power it was because he had fallen out of favour with the top brass.  In opposition Khan has made explosive claims about the military's involvement in politics, including that they plotted a November assassination attempt in which he was shot in the leg while campaigning for fresh polls.  His arrest last Tuesday came just hours after he repeated the allegations at a rally.  © 2023 AFP","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyYW5jZTI0LmNvbS9lbi9saXZlLW5ld3MvMjAyMzA1MTUtcGFraXN0YW4tZXgtcG0ta2hhbi1kdWUtYmFjay1pbi1jb3VydC1hZnRlci13ZWVrLW9mLXVucmVzdNIBaWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmZyYW5jZTI0LmNvbS9lbi9saXZlLW5ld3MvMjAyMzA1MTUtcGFraXN0YW4tZXgtcG0ta2hhbi1kdWUtYmFjay1pbi1jb3VydC1hZnRlci13ZWVrLW9mLXVucmVzdA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2023-05-13","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 06:26:18","Listen to this story:  ROME – In what’s been taken as the latest turning point in Pope Francis’s campaign to empower laity in the Catholic Church, on Saturday the pontiff issued a new fundamental law for the Vatican City State which, for the first time, allows both lay men and women to sit on its governing commission.  Heretofore, that commission had been composed entirely of cardinals. The move complements a similar change Francis made in his new constitution for the Roman Curia last year, which decreed that a lay person, man or woman, can head a curial department. (The Roman Curia assists the pope in governing the universal church, while the Vatican City State administers the pope’s physical territory.)  In that sense, the new fundamental law, which replaces one issued by Pope John Paul II in 2000, is indeed a watershed for the lay role. In this case, however, it’s probably one which should also come with a warning.  As opposed to the Roman Curia, it’s hardly a novelty for laity to have a share in governing the pope’s physical territory. During the era of the Papal States, when popes ruled over a swath of central Italy as a temporal monarch, the head of government nominally was always the Cardinal Secretary of State, but the pope generally would appoint a Minister of the Interior who actually called the shots.  Over the years, sometimes that role was played by a cleric, but often it was a layman.  (As a footnote, it’s often said, erroneously, that popes lost their temporal powers in 1870 with the collapse of the Papal States amid Italian unification. Not so – what popes lost was territory, not power. With regard to the Vatican City State, the pope retains absolute civil authority to this day. Just to make sure no one misses the point, the new fundamental law specifies that the pope possesses “the fullness of the power of governance” as the “sovereign,” including “legislative, executive and judicial power.”)  That background brings us to the tale of the last layperson to exercise civil authority in the name of the pope: Pellegrino Rossi, who fate perhaps should serve as a cautionary tale for whoever his successors may be under Francis’s new scheme.  Born in Tuscany in 1787, Rossi studied law in Pisa and Bologna and became a celebrated professor and political thinker. After periods in Switzerland and France, he ended up as the personal envoy of King Louis Philippe I to the Papal States. After the king abdicated in February 1848, Rossi remained in Rome, and eventually was named the interior minister of the new pontiff Pope Pius IX in September of the same year.  By the time of Rossi’s appointment, revolutionary energies were stirring in Rome. Rossi was a federalist, meaning he believed in a federation of independent states on the Italian peninsula, including the full sovereignty of the Papal States, as opposed to the press for national unification then beginning to gather steam.  Although Rossi began efforts to modernize the pope’s civil administration, including plans for new railway miles and telegraph lines, it wasn’t enough for the revolutionaries, who were still seething over Pius IX’s famous allocution Non Semel, in which he made clear he would not join to military push to drive Austria out of northern Italy on the grounds that a pope could not go to war against a Catholic power.  Thus when Rossi arrived at Rome’s Piazza della Cancelleria at around 1:00 p.m. on November 15, 1848, for the opening of a session of the Chamber of Deputies in the Papal States, an assassin was waiting. As Rossi ascended the steps, a man emerged from the crowd and plunged a dagger into his throat. Eyewitness testimony was confused, as some said the assailant was wearing the uniform of a soldier, others that he was dressed as a parliamentarian. In any event, in chaos that followed, the killer was able to disappear.  Rossi staggered for a few steps, then fell to the ground dead.  His assassination set in motion a series of events which led to Pope Pius IX fleeing Rome to take refuge in Gaeta, a seaside town about 100 miles south, which at the time was part of the Bourbon Kingdom of Two Sicilies and a staunch ally of the papacy. Meanwhile in Rome a new revolutionary republic under Giuseppe Mazzini was declared, which would endure until the short-lived restoration of the pope’s secular authority in 1850.  By all accounts, Rossi was a gentle, urbane man of culture. Camillo Benso, the Count of Cavour, described Rossi in one of his letters as “the wittiest man in Italy, the most flexible genius of the age, perhaps the most practical mind in the universe.”  The great likelihood is that Rossi’s assassin had no real beef with him, but killed him as a blow against the pope he served.  Of course, it’s deeply improbable that restless denizens of the 108 acre territory the pope has left today would ever rise against one of his ministers in quite so violent a fashion. Knives in the back in the Vatican these days tend to be metaphorical, not literal.  Nevertheless, there’s still a sobering moral to this story: Anyone who wields authority in the name of the pope needs to know that sometimes, people upset with the pontiff may turn on you as a softer target.  In that light, perhaps the first lay person to sit on the new-fangled governing commission of the Vatican City State ought to make a trek to Rome’s Basilica of San Lorenzo in Damaso, where Rossi is entombed, and spend a moment in quiet prayer.  Uneasy, indeed, lies the head that wears even a share of the crown … whether that head, as it turns out, be clerical or lay.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vY3J1eG5vdy5jb20vbmV3cy1hbmFseXNpcy8yMDIzLzA1L3BvcGVzLWxhdGVzdC13YXRlcnNoZWQtZm9yLWxhaXR5LXByb2JhYmx5LW91Z2h0LXRvLWNvbWUtd2l0aC1hLXdhcm5pbmcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

This violent response by the public is a result of the escalating wave of violence perpetrated by armed gangs in the country.  According to local residents cited by Le Nouvelliste, on Friday, two suspected bandits were killed by members of the population while attempting to hijack a cargo truck on the road to Nazón. The suspects were armed, and the residents took matters into their own hands to protect themselves.  On Saturday, police authorities arrested four suspected bandits in possession of ammunition and automatic weapons in Gonaives. However, the situation took a gruesome turn when members of the population forcibly took custody of the suspects, subjecting them to stoning before setting them on fire. This represents the first time such an action has occurred in Gonaives since the emergence of the “Bwa kale” movement.  In a separate incident, on Monday, alleged bandit Abouló, a member of the “Nou se revolisyonè” group operating in the Raboto district, was arrested in Biennac. He was apprehended alongside two others, Ady Gaston and Poristène Byron. The police confiscated firearms and cell phones from them. Abouló faces charges of multiple murders and the burning of the city’s courthouse.  The Bwa kale movement has gained momentum in the capital and various provinces of Haiti. Comprised of members of the population, this movement takes matters into its own hands through acts of lynching against suspected bandits. The rise of such vigilantism reflects the frustration and desperation of the people in the face of rampant gang violence in the country.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL2RvbWluaWNhbnRvZGF5LmNvbS9kci93b3JsZC8yMDIzLzA1LzE1L3RoZS1yZXZlbmdlLW9mLXRoZS1wb3B1bGF0aW9uLXNpeC1hbGxlZ2VkLWJhbmRpdHMtYXNzYXNzaW5hdGVkLWFuZC1vbmUtaW1wcmlzb25lZC1pbi1oYWl0aS_SAY4BaHR0cHM6Ly9kb21pbmljYW50b2RheS5jb20vYW1wL25ld3M_aWQ9MTkwODQ5JnRpdGxlPXRoZS1yZXZlbmdlLW9mLXRoZS1wb3B1bGF0aW9uLXNpeC1hbGxlZ2VkLWJhbmRpdHMtYXNzYXNzaW5hdGVkLWFuZC1vbmUtaW1wcmlzb25lZC1pbi1oYWl0aQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"assassination","2023-05-13","Not Discerned","{""Gaza"", ""Gaza"", ""GazaStrip""}","Sun 14 May 2023 18:02:38","Courtesy of: Al-Jarmaq News  A truce agreement mediated by Egypt brought a stop to 10 days of fire between the Gaza Strip and Israel on Saturday night.  During the flare-up in fighting that followed the death of imprisoned Palestinian activist Khader Adnan, Israeli airstrikes killed at least 18 Palestinians, while rockets from the Gaza Strip killed two civilians in Israeli-occupied territory.  Negotiations on a truce agreement, said two sources close to mediation efforts conducted by Cairo, were rendered complex due to Israel conducting multiple targeted assassinations, killing several senior members of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad Organization, despite officials in Tel Aviv having previously made pledges to stop the use of targeted assassinations.  At least six members of the Gaza-based organization were killed by the Israeli army in under a week, many of them members of the Islamic Jihad’s senior military council. A seventh official and his aide were also reportedly killed, though the group has yet to officially confirm the additional deaths.  Ten Palestinian civilians were also killed by Israeli airstrikes that were conducted in densely populated areas of the Gaza Strip, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.  Two civilians were killed in Israel by returning fire from the strip, where Al-Quds Brigades, the military arm of Islamic Jihad, said that “the Palestinian resistance launched a concentrated missile strike in two phases towards occupied Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.”    Israel’s prime minister and its national security advisor both thanked Cairo for its efforts to mediate the truce agreement, which came into effect on Saturday night.  But the conflict could be sparked again, said the first source. Israel’s current government — its most right-wing government so far — is subject to the hardline positions of its national security and finance ministers, Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, for whom Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu must work hard to keep close. The right-wing Israeli government wanted to start and end the war without any long-term commitments, said the two sources speaking to Mada Masr on condition of anonymity, and there are limits to the pressure that Cairo is able to exert on the Palestinian factions.  Cairo has been working since May 10 toward reaching a ceasefire between the Israeli occupation forces and factions in the Gaza Strip. The talks, they said, were held with Israeli and Palestinian Islamic Jihad representatives in the Egyptian capital, in Gaza with representatives of Hamas and other political groups based in the besieged strip, and finally, in Israel, with political and security officials.  To establish consensus on a ceasefire, they said, Israel needed to clearly pledge in written form to stop pursuing assassinations and hand over the bodies of any assassinated Palestinian figures. Palestinian factions, meanwhile, were obliged to publicly accept a truce — not just a ceasefire — and to accept Egyptian supervision to neutralize rocket launch capabilities from Gaza.  Egypt had to use “clear” language with Israel about the risks of “playing with fire,” said the first source, who was very close to the mediation efforts, given that Israel moved to expand its targeted assassinations. Egypt also requested that the United States and Europe pressure Israel to respond to mediation efforts, the two sources said.  Cairo “intensively moved at high levels” to avoid an escalation, said the first source, especially given the potential for the exchange of fire to take on regional dimensions.  Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian expressed support for the Palestinian resistance on Friday, announcing that he had made contact with Ismail Haniyeh, head of Hamas’ political bureau in Gaza. Hamas, the main faction operating armed resistance from the Gaza Strip, did not join the exchange of fire that broke out in May.  Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah also said on Friday that Hezbollah is communicating with groups in Gaza, saying, “We are monitoring the situation and its developments and providing assistance, and at any time we feel responsible to take any steps, we will not hesitate to do so.”  Groups in Gaza launched attacks on Israel following the May 2 death of Khader Adnan, a Palestinian activist jailed in Israel who starved to death following 87 days of hunger strike.  Riyad Mansour, Palestine’s permanent representative to the United Nations, called on Tuesday for serious and rapid measures to be taken to protect the Palestinian people and ensure their security, and to end the illegal Israeli colonial occupation and the apartheid regime that have been causing so much human suffering for decades and prevented the achievement of just and lasting peace and security in the region.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYWRhbWFzci5jb20vZW4vMjAyMy8wNS8xNC9uZXdzL3BvbGl0aWNzL3NvdXJjZXMtZWd5cHQtbWVkaWF0ZWQtdHJ1Y2UtcmV2b2x2ZWQtYXJvdW5kLWlzcmFlbGktY29tbWl0bWVudC10by1zdG9wLWFzc2Fzc2luYXRpb25zL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Haiti is the only country in the Caribbean or the world that the United Nations and other NGO organizations rank as the place with the most crime and gangs. Last week, the Haitian population along with the police killed and burned more than 20 residents who they said were gang members. Not counting other residents across the country who are killed on the pretext that they are gang members.  After the assassination of the former Haitian President in 2021, the U.S. and Canada were among the countries that ordered sanctions against the Haitian elites who sponsored the gangs despite proof that most of the powerful weapons are from the United States. A year later, the Dominican Republic ordered sanctions on former Prime Minister Claude Joseph for having a deep connection with the gangs. Canada’s Prime Minister even called on Europe and other continents to join his sanctions on powerful Haitian elites.  During the Presidency of former President Moise, crimes and kidnappings were very high. President Moise was criticized for not saying anything at all about high crimes and kidnappings during his administration. Since his assassination by Colombians and Haitian-Americans, crimes and kidnapping continued.  Since the killings of some individuals weeks ago, other residents across the country are not free or safe. There are currently allegations or conspiracy of killing unknown residents who come from another area. If the population catches an unknown resident from another area, there is a 98% chance that the population will kill and burn that resident.  According to several sources, there are many residents who are declared innocent by others who died this way. For now, no one in this country is safe because the population is mixed with armed people going around killing anyone they don’t recognize in an area even when they have no proof.  On Sunday, the Haitian politician Nortreus posted a safety alert publication on his Facebook account on the current crimes and assassinations across the country. He said he will not advise any citizens or investors from African countries to visit Haiti right now because there are many acts of violence and assassinations everywhere in the country.  “My concern on the current situation in Haiti. As a young Haitian politician who has friends and associates across the African continent, I will not advise citizens from African countries or investors to visit Haiti or invest right now because of violence and assassinations. Right now, this country is currently not safe to visit or invest in. Wait until the violence and assassinations go away to visit or invest”, Nortreus said on what is currently happening in Haiti in order to save lives.  According to several other reports, among the dead individuals from past weeks to today, there are several innocent residents who died along with the ones that the population and police classified as gang members due to fraudulent identity. Right now, no one is safe and any foreigners can get killed and burned.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vc2ZsY24uY29tL2hhaXRpYW4tcG9saXRpY2lhbi1hZHZpc2VzLWFmcmljYS1jaXRpemVucy1hbmQtaW52ZXN0b3JzLW5vdC10by12aXNpdC1oYWl0aS1kdWUtdG8tY3JpbWVzLXRoZXJlL9IBcmh0dHBzOi8vc2ZsY24uY29tL2hhaXRpYW4tcG9saXRpY2lhbi1hZHZpc2VzLWFmcmljYS1jaXRpemVucy1hbmQtaW52ZXN0b3JzLW5vdC10by12aXNpdC1oYWl0aS1kdWUtdG8tY3JpbWVzLXRoZXJlLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2023-05-08","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Sun 14 May 2023 17:28:00","The opening strike of Operation Shield and Arrow that killed three Palestinian Islamic Jihad commanders in Gaza last Monday has reignited the ongoing debate on the legality of targeted killings.  Israel, like other states, is bound to international law. Some of its obligations are due to treaties, but there is also customary IHL -- generally accepted practices by states, who treat the practice as if it were law. Israel has adopted the Geneva Conventions, save for the Additional Protocols, but the High Court of Justice sees them as customary law. This shows how important the repeated practices of other states are in IHL.  Targeted killings are a somewhat ill-defined term. There is no set definition under International Humanitarian Law (IHL). Some sources treat it as merely a softer term than assassination, still others describe it as a military strike against a specific person -- in particular that of terrorists.  The International Committee of the Red Cross says that targeted killing is ""The intentional and premeditated use of lethal force, by a State or organized armed group against a specific individual outside their physical custody.""  This, like other definitions, can be applied to most other applications of military force. It is not exclusive to a particular legal or illegal action.  In Israel, it generally refers to a policy of targeting of the top echelons of terrorist organizations. Yet this can also be seen as a natural military action in the course of war, rather than a distinct category under IHL.  Palestinian rescue workers inspect a house where Islamic Jihad commander Ahmed Abu Daqqa was killed in an Israeli strike, in the southern Gaza Strip May 11, 2023 (credit: REUTERS/IBRAHEEM ABU MUSTAFA)  How does international humanitarian law consider targeted killings?  There do exist tools within the IHL framework to determine the legality of a military strike.  There is little that differentiates the opening blow of Shield and Arrow from strikes conducted later in the operation, save for the ongoing launching of rockets from Gaza. This creates a question of military necessity, one of the main principles of IHL.  The IDF argues that there was an impending threat from the Islamic Jihad commanders, and this created military necessity to strike. Killing the commanders reduced the capabilities of the organization to conduct terrorist attacks.  Yet it could also be argued that it has become customary in IHL for terrorist leaders to demand killing over a more general threat posed to a state. It is disputed whether Osama Bin Laden presented an immediate threat to the United States of America when then-president Barack Obama ordered his killing. The US contended he was still operationally active, but cited no active field operation. There was little to no backlash over this action. The killing of Gazan PIJ leaders could likewise be seen as having degraded terrorist effort in part of a sequential attack, or war, against Israel and its citizens.  In the discussion of targeted killings, sometimes the question is one of distinction. Under this principle of IHL, one differentiate between civilians and combatants in attacks, and take necessary precautions to avoid civilian casualties.  The status of Gazan terrorists is a matter of debate. Some argue that terrorists are unlawful combatants, but retain the status of civilians. This means they are only considered combatants when they are directly involved in direct hostilities. In state armed forces, High ranking officers who do not fight and only command and plan far from the battlefield are generally considered legitimate targets. This likely means that the action of ordering and planning could be considered a direct hostile action.  Yet non-state armed groups are also bound by IHL in both international and non-international conflicts. These commanders were part of an organized military force that had a hierarchy, insignias and uniform. Many treat Gaza as a de facto state, and the terrorist organizations as de facto state military forces. Western states targeted leaders of the Islamic State with increasing regularity, treating them as if they were members of an opposing armed force of recognized combatants.  Unlike in the West Bank, it is difficult to argue that Gazans are under occupation, which would mean that they lack that unlawful combatants have the same protections in that state of conflict.  Some are quick to point out that even if there is no debate about whether Islamic Jihad commanders are legitimate targets under IHL as combatants, the Israeli strikes also took the lives of the terrorists' civilian family members.  This is a matter of applying the principle of proportionality. The military advantage of a strike must exceed the potential risk of damage to civilians. This is determined by a reasonable commander using the best information at the time.  It is difficult to determine without full access to the extent of the impending threat, and understanding how the commanders fit into the PIJ hierarchy, to determine if the value of the military degradation was greater than the risk to civilians.  These IHL principles of proportionality, distinction and military necessity should be applied to all such targeted killings -- as they are to all IDF military strikes.  Therein lies the problem with the debate about targeted killings: Despite discussion of premeditation and accuracy, the term is more of a nebulous pejorative used to cast aspersion on a military action rather than carefully explore and weigh the facts of the individual incident.  It has become a label for if one approves of a military strike against a terrorist or not. It is a label that applies to some states, like Israel, and rarely questioned when used by others.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpwb3N0LmNvbS9pc3JhZWwtbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlLTc0MzA0MNIBMmh0dHBzOi8vbS5qcG9zdC5jb20vaXNyYWVsLW5ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS03NDMwNDAvYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"assassination","2023-05-13","17:00:00","{""Harare"", ""Harare"", ""Zimbabwe""}","Sun 14 May 2023 09:45:08","Presidential spokesperson George Charamba has claimed that President Emmerson Mnangagwa saved the new British monarch, King Charles III’s life, from Rhodesians who wanted to kill him during the colonial era.  Posting on Twitter using one of his accounts, Tinoedza Zvimwe, Charamba claimed Mnangagwa was invited to Charles III’s coronation on 06 May 2023 after he saved the latter from assassination by Rhodesians. He wrote:  Charles, now King Charles III, would have been killed by Rhodesians, except for a tip-off from a Rhodesian intelligence officer to the current President, then as state security minister. That all explains why ED had to be at King Charles’ coronation, and why relations with the UK are fated for a reset under President ED! Enjoy!  Meanwhile, some social media users mocked Mnangagwa saying he was snubbed during King Charles III’s coronation in London on Saturday.  However, ZANU PF spokesperson Chris Mutsvangwa said that Mnangagwa was not part of the heads of State and government who had a photo opportunity with King Charles III because Zimbabwe is not a Commonwealth member.  Speaking on the sidelines of the burial of national hero Abraham Kabasa in Harare on Monday, Mutsvangwa said:  We are not a member of the Commonwealth, the President is determined that we should be readmitted into the group of nations.  Mutsvangwa added that Zimbabwe does not have the right to get close and personal with the king as it is not a Commonwealth member. He said:  But as for Zimbabwe, we did not have the right because we are not yet a member of the grouping. When we become a member, we would be part of those who will be close to the king. We want to engage with countries that we have cordial relationships and re-engage those we have had frosty relationships with in the past. Our President always says we are friends to all and enemies to none. We were happy that our President was invited to King Charles III’s coronation. When he was still a prince, he lowered the Union Jack (British flag) and raised the Zimbabwean flag after we had won the liberation struggle in 1980. It’s a person who we like a lot and it was imperative for the President to attend. This shows that the engagement between Harare and London is going in a good direction.

"assassination","2023-05-10","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Sun 14 May 2023 15:13:36","Some gunmen suspected to be members of the Eastern Security Network, the militant wing of the Indigenous People of Biafra, have reportedly killed two brothers and set their house ablaze in Aba, Abia State, southeast Nigeria.  The two brothers identified as Aaron Onuoha, 41 and Obinechi Samuel Onuoha, 35, were gruesomely assassinated in their family house at Ohanku by Udoka Street/Amucha, off Ngwa Road on Wednesday morning.  SaharaReporters gathered that the assailants who were reportedly numbering over 50 and wore black attire, invaded the house at about 1:20 am. They were said to have surrounded the house and cut off the electricity supply before some of them stormed the compound and killed the brothers.  According to sources, the assailants also burnt the house.  Samuel was a fashion designer based in Aba, while Aaron was a builder and a sculptor, who was based in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State.  Aaron had visited his brother on Tuesday evening to discuss family matters.  The hoodlums also allegedly attacked the Chief Security Officer of the area and burnt the security post.  A source told SaharaReporters that the CSO narrowly escaped being killed by the assailants.  A close associate of the late Samuel who spoke to SaharaReporters on condition of anonymity, revealed that he was attacked last year by hoodlums suspected to be cultists but survived the attack.  ""In that particular attack, it was in the daytime and he saw the faces of those who tried to kill him,” the source said.  He continued, ""I find it unbelievable because that night when I got information about the incident, I rushed to the scene. And while I was going, I met several local security personnel at their checkpoints.  “So where were they when the brothers were being killed and their house set ablaze?""  According to him, he later heard a report that the assailants accused Samuel of giving out information to police about them and their hideouts.  He said, “I know that he had police friends who were working with the police Rapid Response Squad (RRS) in Aba.  ""Before his gruesome killing, I had on one occasion asked whether he gave information about bad boys to the police and he said no. According to him, when he was attacked the last time by some cult group, he went to RRS office to see some of his friends, especially his in-law and one of the cult guys that shot at him. He told the in-law that this one was among those that attacked him and that is all.""  The source, however, regretted that no security agent either from the police division around the area or the RSS unit intervened during the attack until the morning when the criminals had gone.  Also speaking to SaharaReporters, a sibling of the deceased brothers, Agbeze Onuoha confirmed the tragic incident and called on security agencies to fish out the perpetrators to ensure that they face justice.  Lamenting the incident, he said his late brothers left behind 10 children – five each. He asked how he would cope with caring for the wives and children left behind.  Narrating the unfortunate incident, Agbeze, an employee of Enugu Electricity Distribution Company in Abakaliki, the Ebonyi State capital, said, ""I came back to see my mother on Saturday and I was supposed to go back to my working station on Wednesday. Unfortunately, that early Wednesday morning, my phone rang; it was my nephew. He called to tell me that two of my brothers had been killed.  ""The elder one Aaron is living at Uyo in Akwa Ibom State but came back to see his brother in Aba on Tuesday and they were killed together. That is what I can say, I don't know what transpired. I just came to see our mother in Aba because my family is in Okigwe, Imo State while I am working in Abakaliki.  ""So when I got the report, I went there and saw what happened and reported to the police. They came and carried their corpses to the mortuary.""  He added that Samuel's wife who was present when the assailants killed the brother, said the killers drove her and her five children out of the house before burning it.  He said according to her, the assailants were more than 50 in number and were in black attire.  He added, ""From the information I gathered, their killers said Samuel was giving information to police where they are. Even the children said when they went to fetch water, some people were telling them that their father used to give information to the police about them.""  ""My family is demanding justice; the police should fish out their killers and make them pay for their crimes,"" he said.  Agbeze, however, noted that he had informed Aaron’s wife about the tragic incident, adding that he was “planning to bury them next week"".  When SaharaReporters contacted the spokesperson for the state police command, SP Geoffrey Ogbonna, for an update, he declined to comment.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vc2FoYXJhcmVwb3J0ZXJzLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE0L2d1bm1lbi1raWxsLXR3by1icm90aGVycy1hbGxlZ2VkbHktZ2l2aW5nLXBvbGljZS1pbmZvcm1hdGlvbi1hYmEtc291dGhlYXN0LW5pZ2VyaWHSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
