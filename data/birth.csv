Lauren and her twin brother, David, spent the first four months of their lives in the neonatal intensive care unit at St. Luke’s University Hospital in Fountain Hill after their birth in March 2001.  They were delivered by emergency caesarean section at 29 weeks. Lauren was just 1 pound, 10 ounces; David was 2 pounds, 13 ounces.  Among the nurses who cared for them was Susan Foster.  In July, Weintraub, newly graduated from the nursing program at Cedar Crest College, will join Foster as a NICU nurse at St. Luke’s-Allentown.  Now 22, Weintraub graduated Saturday. Just before the ceremony, Foster, who inspired and supported Weintraub on her journey through nursing school, was the one to place a pin on her during the pinning ceremony.  “I took care of Lauren as a baby at the start of my career as a NICU nurse,” the 65-year-old Foster said. “I’m at the tail end of my career but to know that I’ll be working with her at the bedside is incredible. To have the opportunity to pass on the knowledge I’ve gained over the years, it’s amazing.”  It won’t be the first time they’ve worked together. During Weintraub’s final clinical rotation at the Allentown campus, Foster served as her nurse preceptor, the person who watched over her and helped her put what she learned in nursing school into practice.  “I learned from the best of the best of the best,” Weintraub said.  As a NICU nurse with more than 20 years of experience and a mother to children who were born prematurely, Foster knows what it’s like to provide and receive excellent care in the NICU.  In 1989 she gave birth to twin boys at 29 weeks gestation, an experience that changed her life forever.  “I barely even knew what a NICU was, to be honest with you, but I was inspired by the nurses that took care of my boys. They were incredible,” Foster said. “It was truly probably one of the scariest times of my life but those nurses were amazing. They became my family.”  At the time, Foster was a flight attendant, but she decided on a career change. She went back to school and became a nurse in 1998. She started working in the NICU at St. Luke’s University Hospital in 2000.  “I couldn’t think of anything else that was more important to me than giving a little baby a chance at a great life like those nurses did for my boys,” Foster said.  Both of Weintraub’s parents are nurses, and Weintraub said from an early age she knew she wanted to do something health care related. The NICU stayed close to Weintraub’s heart as she was growing up. Every year on Christmas Eve, she and her brother would visit with cookies for the nurses.  “They loved seeing how much we’d grown each year and the new things we were doing,” Weintraub said.  But the Bethlehem native said she didn’t know she wanted to be a NICU nurse until middle school, when she volunteered in the Fountain Hill campus NICU through the St. Luke’s March of Dimes program.  “All of those nurses inspired me, just the way that they handled those babies and their natural ability to calm them and care for them was absolutely amazing to me,” Weintraub said. “And I realized how much I loved being there and I love sharing my story with parents in the NICU. We found that it was really inspiring to them and it gave them a sense of hope when they were struggling.”  Foster said during the clinical rotation, she saw Weintraub’s natural affinity for the job. She’s proud of the woman and nurse Weintraub has become.  “She can really put parents at ease,” Foster said. “One time she shared her story with parents and they couldn’t believe it, that she had been born at 29 weeks and was premature but here she was.”  Morning Call reporter Leif Greiss can be reached at 610-679-4028 or lgreiss@mcall.com."

Mental health challenges can come unexpectedly and look different for everyone. They may appear at a time that is considered to be one of the happiest of your life, the birth of a baby. A new baby can bring big changes that cause a stir of emotions, from excitement to joy and fear to anxiety.  For one East Texas mother, the feelings were more severe and lasted longer.  “I really couldn’t do much. Like, I didn’t have much of a functioning capability, really, just to do day-to-day adult life things. They were hard,” a nurse at UT Health East Texas, Alyssa Brown, said. ” Eventually, I started having suicidal thoughts. Never tried to; never had a plan, necessarily, but I knew all of it was not normal.”  Brown gave birth to her baby while working as a nurse for UT Health East Texas in 2018. That’s around the time, she experienced postpartum depression.  Health officials say it can be mistaken for “baby blues,” but the symptoms are more intense and last longer. According to the C.D.C., one out of every eight new moms experience postpartum depression after giving birth.  For Brown, besides taking medication, she also decided to do therapy.  “I think therapy is what saved me for sure, what helped me just to learn,” Brown said. “How to think what I was thinking, you know, and how to process it and get past it.”  If you’re experiencing postpartum depression or if your “baby blues” don’t go away after two weeks, the C.D.C recommends getting in touch with your primary doctor.

An autopsy on the baby listed the cause and manner of the death as “undetermined,” according to a complaint warrant by the Scott County Sheriff’s Office.  Holtzclaw is accused of working alongside the juvenile, who is also charged in the case, to “conceal the child’s entire existence altogether, and/ or prevent the determination of whether it was born dead or alive,” according to the complaint.  Investigators wrote in the complaint that Holtzclaw and the juvenile admitted that they buried the baby in the backyard after birth between Dec. 5 and Dec. 6 of 2022.  The two are accused of attempting to bury the baby in a shoe box, but upon realizing the box wasn’t big enough they put the body in a plastic Dollar Tree shopping bag before burying it, according to the complaint.  Investigators allege that the actions of Holtzclaw and the juvenile contributed to the decomposition that prevented an autopsy from determining the baby’s cause of death, according to the complaint.  Holtzclaw is also accused of sending explicit videos to the juvenile he was in a “relationship” with and receiving explicit images in return, according to a separate complaint.  “Holtzclaw told investigators it was his opinion that it wasn’t right that he could legally have intercourse with the juvenile girlfriend, yet still be held accountable for having sexual performance imagery on his SnapChat or cellular device would get him into legal trouble,” an investigator wrote in the complaint warrant. “Holtzclaw told this investigator that we should change that law as in his opinion it was ‘not right.’”"

She told detectives she was unaware she was pregnant before giving birth, and that thought she was just getting sick. She said she didn't go to the hospital afterward because she was in the country illegally and didn't want to get in trouble. She also didn't have any money to pay the medical expenses. She admitted putting the infant's remains in the dumpster later that evening.

In a 6-1 decision, the Supreme Court blocked the Logan County Family Court from considering providing Kaidan Whitrock parenting time with an infant that is being adopted by a Van Wert County family selected by the birth mother. Whitrock lost his attempt to block the adoption when the Supreme Court decided in December 2022 that he waited too long to act after the adoption petition was filed.  The Court’s per curiam opinion noted that Whitrock sought the help of the Logan County court after the Van Wert County Probate Court would not allow him to participate in the adoption case when he requested to intervene. The Court wrote that instead of seeking help from another court, Whitrock could appeal the rejection of his right to intervene.  Chief Justice Sharon L. Kennedy and Justices R. Patrick DeWine, Michael P. Donnelly, Melody Stewart, Jennifer Brunner, and Joseph T. Deters joined the per curiam opinion. Justice Patrick F. Fischer dissented without a written opinion.  Click to Expand  Parenting Rights Considered After Adoption Request Submitted  Josephine Davis gave birth to a child identified in court records as “H.P.” in 2020. She was 17 years old at the time. Davis was not married to Whitrock, who was 18 years old, and presumed to be the child’s biological father. Whitrock’s paternity had not been established when H.P. was born.  To address paternity disputes, Ohio lawmakers established a Putative Father Registry in 1996 in R.C. 3107.061 et seq. Under this law, a father’s consent to the adoption of a minor child is not required unless the father registers with the putative father registry no later than 15 days after the child is born.  Three days after the birth of H.P., the married couple chosen by Davis filed a petition in the Van Wert County Probate Court to adopt the newborn baby. As the adoption request was pending, the probate court issued a placement order that granted the couple “care, custody, and control” over H.P., and Whitrock filed an objection to the adoption.  About two weeks after the adoption petition was filed, Whitrock asked Logan County Family Court Judge Natasha Kennedy to give parental rights and responsibilities to him, including authorizing genetic testing to determine paternity. While some counties have separate courts for matters dealing with children, the Logan County Family Court has combined jurisdiction over juvenile, domestic relations, and probate matters.  The genetic test results confirmed Whitrock is H.P.’s biological father. Judge Kennedy of Logan County stayed all action on Whitrock’s request for parental rights until after the Van Wert County probate court ruled in the H.P. adoption case. In January 2021, the Van Wert court denied Whitrock’s motion to intervene and ruled his consent was not required to grant the adoption.  Visitation Rights Case Resumed After Supreme Court Decision  Whitrock’s appeal of the Van Wert court’s decision to keep him out of the adoption case reached the Supreme Court in 2022. The Court remanded the matter to the Third District Court of Appeals, and in turn, the Third District remanded the case to the Van Wert probate court to consider whether Whitrock could claim his right to object to the adoption as the biological father of H.P.  The probate court is still considering the issue. As it does, Whitrock asked the Logan County Family Court to issue temporary orders granting him parenting time with H.P. and to move forward in determining if he should be granted custody.  H.P.’s mother and the adopting couple asked the Supreme Court for a writ of prohibition to prevent Judge Kennedy of Logan County from acting in the case. The mother and couple argued that the decisions regarding H.P. are solely to be made by the probate court in Van Wert.  Supreme Court Analyzed Roles of Multiple Courts in Adoption Cases  The per curiam opinion explains the Supreme Court must determine if the Logan County court is empowered to make decisions without interfering with the Van Wert court’s authority.  The Supreme Court explained that in general, only one court can have jurisdiction over a case at a time. In matters where it is possible that two or more courts could have the authority to consider a case, the general rule is the court that acts first is the one empowered to decide the case.  However, where two courts do not have the same powers the rule does not apply, the opinion stated. A probate court and a juvenile court have separate powers, and can both act, the opinion stated. Because the Logan County Family Court has the combined powers of three divisions, Judge Kennedy has some powers through her juvenile court responsibilities to “proceed with matters relevant to and in aid of the adoption proceedings,” the Supreme Court found.  Judge Kennedy has the power to determine the paternity of a child born out of wedlock and her finding that Whitrock was the biological father by use of genetic testing was not contested. However, the mother and the couple disputed Judge Kennedy’s right to decide matters beyond determining paternity, the opinion noted.  The Supreme Court ruled that the preadoption placement of H.P. with the couple was made by the Van Wert probate court. Once the probate court granted the placement, the probate court gained the exclusive right to determine the best interests of H.P.  Both the Logan County and Van Wert County courts contend they have the jurisdiction to determine the best interests of the child. The Supreme Court found any attempt by the Logan County court to grant visitation rights to Whitrock would be based on the assessment that it is in the best interest of H.P. By examining the best interests of H.P., the Logan County court is interfering with the Van Wert court’s right to determine the best interests of H.P., the opinion stated.  Any determination of whether Whitrock’s right to parenting time is in H.P.’s best interest is an issue that only the probate court in Van Wert can consider, the Court ruled.  In response to the mother and adopting couple’s attempt to prohibit her from acting, the Logan County judge argued that she must make the decision to consider Whitrock’s rights because the probate court denied Whitrock’s right to intervene and participate in the placement case.  The Supreme Court ruled that the Van Wert probate court’s decision to deny Whitrock’s participation does not create a right for the Logan Count Family Court to act on the matter. Whitrock instead should address his objections through the probate court, and any rights he has to appeal that court’s decisions, the Supreme Court concluded.  2022-0232. State ex rel. Davis v.

Chennai Super Kings on the brink of playoff qualification  Talking about his side’s performances in the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL) 2023, Chennai Super Kings have been doing quite well for themselves. Currently, they find themselves in second place in the standings with 15 points from 13 matches.  Having won seven matches, lost five, and one deemed no result, the four-time champions are on the brink of qualifying for the knockout stages of the tournament.  With just one game left in the group stage for Chennai, the MS Dhoni-led side would look to finish the proceedings on a winning note and make their way to the playoffs. They take on the David Warner-led Delhi Capitals next in the 67th game of the tournament on Saturday, May 20 at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in Delhi.  It is to be noted that Delhi became the first side to be eliminated from the competition after their recent loss to Punjab Kings on May 13. However, this could prove dangerous for Chennai, as Delhi would come into the game with nothing to lose.  The last time both sides faced each other, it resulted in a win for the four-time champions, and the side would hope that the same could be the case this time around as well.      "

I’ve shared in the past I have had a lot of hate and negativity towards even mentioning I’d have another c-section without knowing my circumstances.”  Raven went on, saying, “The last thing I wanted was another c-section. Gates’s birth was a bit traumatic for me. I won’t get into the details but I had an emergency c-section after pushing half his head out. They had to push him back inside of me to make the incision. And a lot more I could explain but I really don’t want to share.”  Instagram  Then Raven shared why she has to have another C-section with this baby and isn’t able to have a VBAC birth.  She said, “With this pregnancy — Unfortunately due to an issue with my placenta I’m not able to try for a VBAC with this pregnancy. It’s a totally different issue that what l had with Gates. His was an emergency c-section, but this one we knew right away once I had my anatomy scan that a vbac was not a safe option for me or the baby.”  Raven concluded her post by writing, “With that being said, I think mothers who want an elected c-section should not be shamed, and we should just wish the best on any birth plan/decisions a mom makes.

(Source: Getty)  More than half of Ausssie parents were inclined to choose the public system when giving birth, according to new research by Finder .  According to Finder’s Parenting Report 2023, which surveyed 1,033 Australian parents of children under 12, 62 per cent said they would go through the public system if they were to have another child.  The research found one in four would go the private route, while one in 10 were on the fence.  Those who have previously gone with private healthcare paid, on average, more than three times as much in out-of-pocket fees ($2,394) than those who took the public path ($726).  Finder health insurance expert James Martin said the decision to have a child was one of life’s most significant milestones, and everyone had their own preferences when choosing to give birth.  “It really depends on personal circumstances but cost and choice are usually the two determining factors when choosing between a public or private birth,” Martin said.  “Some say the main advantage of going private for childbirth is that you can access a more individual level of care. This includes having your own room where your partner can remain at your side throughout your stay in the hospital.  “On the other hand, while you’re guaranteed your own obstetrician, the medical professionals are just as qualified in the public sector as they are in the private sector.”  Why parents said they would choose public  While cost was the number one reason for almost half (46 per cent) who said they would go public, almost two in five said the quality of treatment and care was just as good as going private.  Flexibility around seeing a different medical team (7 per cent) and not choosing an obstetrician (6 per cent) were other reasons some chose to stick with the public system.  Story continues  Why parents said they would choose private  On the other end of the spectrum, 16 per cent of those who said they would go private said it was down to better quality treatment and care.  The ability to choose an obstetrician (15 per cent) and access to a private room (15 per cent) were other determining factors.  Martin said a major difference between the two was the out-of-pocket fees.  “The cost of childbirth in a private hospital is far greater than in the public system, where it’s typically free under Medicare,” he said.  Martin said it was important to account for the costs involved in the private system.  “For one, you’ll need to pay more while you see out your insurance policy’s waiting period. For most, this means at least 12 months of higher premiums while holding a Gold health insurance policy that covers childbirth.  “Your total costs can run into several thousand dollars once you factor in out-of-pocket costs.  “These can include payments for physio visits, antenatal classes and lactation consultant appointments. Plus, you’ll need to pay your policy’s excess when making a claim at the private hospital.”  Follow Yahoo Finance on Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram and Twitter, and subscribe to our free daily newsletter."

Even in the 15 states that gained children, all but North Dakota experienced greater growth in the adult population, meaning children now make up a lower percentage of residents.  In states where the number of children has declined, school officials are facing the possibility of teacher layoffs or even school closures when pandemic aid expires next year. A decline in school enrollment could provide short-term cost savings and might be a benefit to children if there are more resources to go around, but it bodes poorly for future state workforces.  In states where the drop in the number of children is part of a broader population decline, there will be additional fiscal, economic and political ramifications, such as diminished representation in Congress.  The states with the largest drops were California, Illinois and New Mexico, where the child population declined by 6 percent between 2017 and 2022, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data. Idaho and North Dakota saw the largest increases, at 4 percent.  The declines mostly are a reflection of historically low fertility rates, which have been below the replacement rate of two children per woman since 2010. Births increased in only a handful of states in 2021.  But in the 35 states that experienced declines, high housing prices also are a factor. In California, jobs pay well but the state's housing shortage has sent prices beyond the means of young families, said Hans Johnson, a senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California, a nonpartisan think tank.  ""People want to buy a house and have children, but they realize they can't do it here so they look in the vicinity, states close by, and work remotely so they can keep their California paychecks,"" Johnson said.  Slow population growth cost California a seat in Congress after the 2020 census. The number of adults in California grew in the past five years, according to the Stateline analysis, but the decline in the number of children led to a lower overall population.  California also has experienced a phenomenon shared by other Western states: The children of Hispanic immigrants have lower birth rates than their parents. California's total fertility rate dropped from 2.15 per woman in 2008 to a historic low of 1.52 in 2020, the lowest since records have been kept, Johnson wrote in a January report.  California, Illinois and New Mexico all have seen lower school enrollment in recent years, even as they've tried to rekindle interest in public education after pandemic upheavals.  In New Mexico, enrollment has dropped particularly sharply in the northwestern part of the state, where there are many Indigenous students, according to a January state report. Between 2012-2022, enrollment declined by 22 percent in the majority-Native Central Consolidated Schools in San Juan County, compared with a statewide decline of 7 percent, according to the report. Indigenous and other children in the mostly rural area struggle to stay in school because of long bus commutes and lack of internet access at home.  The recent closure of a coal mine and the power generating station it fueled forced many families with children to move away from San Juan County to find jobs, according to Central Consolidated school board President Christina Aspaas.  ""A lot of Navajo workers who were employed had to relocate to Phoenix or elsewhere out of state to earn the same wages,"" Aspaas said. ""It affected the local tribes, Hopi and Navajo, Diné. Seeing the impacts makes my heart break. These are all my children, and they deserve the best in education and in life.""  In Idaho and North Dakota, annual school enrollment has increased over the past five years, except for temporary drops early in the pandemic. But Idaho is bracing for a decline starting in 2025, when children from a historic 2007 baby boom in the state start turning 18.  Idaho has become known as a picturesque and affordable place to raise children, said Jaap Vos, a planning professor at the University of Idaho in Boise. He relocated from Florida with his 3-year-old son in 2012, ""when it was still the middle of nowhere,"" he said. The number of adults in the state grew by 16 percent during the same period.  Boise is getting a lot of new residents from California, and northern Idaho is seeing more movers from Northern California, Washington and Utah. ""It might be for ideological reasons, people looking for a more conservative lifestyle,"" Vos said. He added that some people have left Boise as it has grown more crowded.  Even in northern Idaho, housing prices have risen rapidly.  Writer Leah Hampton is moving from North Carolina to Moscow in northern Idaho to teach at the University of Idaho. But she said she is having trouble finding an affordable house -- even without children. Her husband is working remotely.  ""Moscow is definitely a great place to raise kids. It's like a 1950s movie up here but more diverse and left wing,"" Hampton said. ""All of my friends' children seem really happy and well-adjusted. But cost of living is much higher than we expected. We have money, and we literally can't find anything to buy.""  Many houses are sold sight unseen to investors offering cash, she said.  Another fast-growing state with meager growth in the number of children is Florida, where a decrease in births and an increase in deaths over the past five years has created a negative drag on overall population, according to census estimates. The state had almost 25,000 more births than deaths in 2017, but there were 40,000 more deaths than births by 2022.  Still, Florida had the third-highest increase in child population between 2017 and 2022, at 2 percent. One reason: Hispanic births in Florida have continued to increase, unlike in Western states, said Stefan Rayer, director of the population program at the state Bureau of Economic and Business Research. In fact, births are increasing for white, Black and Hispanic mothers in Florida, helping to offset some of the increasing deaths among the white population, Rayer said.  ""Unless births increase substantially, because of the aging of Florida's population, the state will likely see natural decrease for the foreseeable future, with all growth coming from migration,"" Rayer said.

Matthew Herbert shared photos on Twitter on Saturday (13 May) announcing the birth of his son Finn, saying, “he is just perfect”, and that “everyone is super happy and healthy”.  “Finn arrived literally into my hands with just four pushes at 3:03am on the 13 of May following 18 hours (!!!) of labour contractions,” he wrote.  “Finn has filled a hole in our hearts we didn’t even know existed”  Despite Herbert’s beautiful post celebrating the birth of his child, his post was viciously attacked by trolls, mostly due to his choice to have Finn through a surrogate, something which many people – straight, LGBTQ+, single, married – choose to do, including celebrities like Kim Kardashian.  “Oof. I had no idea surrogacy and adoption were so controversial before reading this … people need to mind their own,” a supportive commenter posted on Twitter.  But many social media users with paid-for blue ticks attacked his post and his new role as a father.  “This baby needs a mother, not you”, “Who suffered the labour contractions?”, “Return that poor baby to the mother” and “This is wrong on so many levels” were just some of the comments left under his photos.  Twitter, he is just perfect.  Finn arrived literally into my hands with just 4 pushes at 3:03am on the 13th of May following 18 hours (!!!) of labour contractions.  Everyone is super happy and healthy.    Finn has filled a hole in our hearts we didn’t even know existed 🥰🥰 pic.twitter.com/YOCCyJU229 — Matthew Herbert (@m_herbert) May 13, 2023  Hitting back at trolls, Herbert explained: “Reading the replies and unsolicited DMs has reminded me how much hate there is in this world, and how there are people who don’t want us and baby Finn to succeed in this world.  “Fear not, it’s all water off a duck’s back for us … but it won’t always be for Finn as he grows.  “Finn is surrounded by more love than could ever be measured.”  He added that he will be protecting the privacy of his baby’s birth mother, who will be a “huge part of our lives forever” and “chose us just as much as we chose her”.  Herbert pointed out to trolls who had attacked him choosing surrogacy, implying he had “purchased” his baby, that “commercial” surrogacy is illegal in New Zealand, therefore surrogates choose to carry the baby for altruistic reasons rather than being paid to do so.  Reading the replies and unsolicited DMs has reminded me how much hate there is in this world, and how there are people who don’t want us and baby Finn to succeed in this world.    Fear not, it’s all water off a ducks back for us.  But it won’t always be for Finn as he grows. 1/ pic.twitter.com/fRimsBNeg9 — Matthew Herbert (@m_herbert) May 15, 2023  In the UK, recommendations have been made for “major changes” to surrogacy law to make things easier for intended parents.  In a review commissioned by the government, the Law Commission of England and Wales and the Scottish Law Commission proposed a new pathway to legal parenthood that would mean intended parents have parental rights from birth.  Currently, intended parents must wait to obtain a court order in order to gain parental rights, which should take six weeks, but in reality can be much longer.  Under the proposals, intended parents would have those rights from birth – though the surrogate would be able to withdraw their consent and assert parental rights until six weeks after birth.  Father and surrogacy advocate Michael Johnson-Ellis “welcomed” the reforms, describing them as a “big win”.  “What it is doing is certainly providing equitable access to parenthood from birth, and that was something that obviously never existed previously,” Johnson-Ellis told PinkNews in March.  “The full report definitely shows more balance with between LGBTQ+ and heterosexual intended parents.”  Just as in New Zealand, paid-for surrogacy is illegal in the UK."

Mikaela and Matt Bennett were pregnant with twins. Mikalea was born with a rare disease that she did not know about, as symptoms did not show until she was pregnant. When she began to get nose bleeds and her legs swelled, they went to the hospital.  On Dec. 21, 2022, she was admitted to the hospital at 24 weeks pregnant with a rare condition known as HHT with AVMs. HHT causes some blood vessels to not develop properly, including the possibility of some not forming with capillaries. AVM stands for arteriovenous malformation, where an abnormal connection is formed between the arteries and the veins. This is usually present in the brain and the spine and present at birth. If AVMs rupture it can cause bleeding in the brain and spinal cords.  “In December the hospital detected it in her own body,” Matt Bennett’s aunt Karin McAdoo said. “It went undetected until she was pregnant with the twins. They also detected an embolism in her lungs which was bleeding, and a lot of other complications.”  After seeing many different types of specialists and baby doctors, McAdoo said Mikaela had an emergency C-Section at 30 weeks pregnant. She gave birth to a boy and a girl — Madalynn and Myles on Feb. 1. McAdoo said Mikaela was not able to see or hold them and they had to be immediately transferred to a different hospital, as they both had AVMs detected as well. The baby girl passed away four days later, but Myles Bennett is still here. McAdoo said Madalynn passed away at a different hospital than the one Mikaela was at, and that Mikaela never got to hold her daughter while she was alive.  “During the C-Section Mikaela coded, but was brought back,” McAdoo said. “Myles has AVMs on his brain. He may end up needing a liver transplant, which is scary for a baby. That’s not something they can do until he is six months old. He is only three months old now.”  The Bennetts have come home since the birth, but have had to travel back and forth to the hospital in Pittsburgh for appointments. McAdoo said at least three different hospitals have been involved in this situation. Matt Bennett did not work from Dec. 21 when they went to the hospital to April 12 when they were released. He had to ask his job to be able to come back, and the only income during that time was donations from people.  The spaghetti dinner — put on by the organization Brother’s By Choice — will be held on Sunday, May 21 from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. at the Celoron Legion, Herman Kent Post 777, 23 Jackson Ave., Jamestown. The price for the dinner is $10, and children five and under are free. Besides the dinner there will be a DJ, bake sale, and basket giveaway.  “We’ve had some amazing donations,” McAdoo said. “We’ve had a queen mattress set donated from Jamestown Mattress. There’s the bake sale, and a lot of other donations, including a grill. There’s a lot of nice stuff.”  Gift certificates and baskets will also be available.  A Go Fund Me for the Bennett family can be found at https://www.gofundme.com/f/cxb357-the-bennett-family.  McAdoo said while there is a long road ahead, the family has been staying strong during this hard time.  “They are an amazing family,” McAdoo said. “They are strong. Their faith has kept them going.”"

Fundal height measures the distance between the top of the uterus and the pelvic bone in a pregnant person. It determines if your baby is growing as expected and confirms gestational age (how far along you are in pregnancy). It can also assess where the baby is in the uterus.    This article discusses fundal height, including what it is, when it's used, and what the measurements mean during pregnancy.  BSIP / Getty Images  Fundal Height Defined  Fundal height is a simple screening tool your healthcare provider uses to monitor your baby’s growth and development. It is measured in centimeters and is often first taken at prenatal appointments starting at 20 weeks of pregnancy. The fundal height measurement in centimeters should be close to the fetus’s gestational age in weeks. For example, if you are 27 weeks pregnant, your fundal height should be about 27 centimeters (give or take 2 centimeters).  A fundal height that is too small or too large could indicate a pregnancy complication. If your fundal height is out of the norm, your healthcare provider will recommend an ultrasound. People with high-risk pregnancies often require more ultrasounds as well.  Fundal height is an imprecise measurement, and some factors can affect it. For instance, fundal height may be more challenging to measure in pregnant people who have a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher. Having a history of uterine fibroids may also affect the accuracy of fundal height.  What Is Average Fundal Height? Average fundal height in centimeters usually is the same numeral as the fetus's gestational age in weeks. For example, if you are 32 weeks pregnant, your fundal height will likely be 32 centimeters.    How Fundal Height Measurements Work  Fundal height can be measured quickly and easily. Your healthcare provider will ask you to lie down face up on the exam table, similar to when you have an ultrasound or pelvic exam.  Your provider will then run a soft tape measure from the area of your belly where the top of your uterus would be down to your pubic bone.  After 20 weeks of pregnancy, your fundal height will likely be measured at each appointment. Before 20 weeks, an ultrasound exam estimates your baby’s gestational age. If your fundal height measurement is higher or lower than expected, your provider will likely remeasure you and then refer you for an ultrasound.    What Are Fundal Height Measurements Used For?  Measuring fundal height is used to monitor fetal growth and development. Several factors can affect how a fetus develops during pregnancy. Fundal height is a simple way to detect potential growth issues or complications.  If your fundal height is low, your baby may not be growing as expected. If your fundal height is high, your baby may grow faster than expected. When your fundal height measurement is below or above average, your healthcare provider will recommend an ultrasound to confirm the finding and determine the cause.  Genetics, nutrition, infection, environmental exposures, and the pregnant person’s overall health influence fetal size and growth.  Small for Gestational Age  ""Small for gestational age"" is a term that refers to a fetus that is smaller or less developed than usual. This is also referred to as intrauterine growth restriction. Babies with a birth weight below the 10th percentile are considered small for gestational age.  If your fundal height is smaller than expected, your baby may be small for gestational age. It is also possible that you are not as far along in pregnancy as previously estimated.  Possible causes of being small for gestational age include:  Genetic conditions  Metabolic diseases (medical conditions caused by a genetic defect)  Chromosome anomalies (a change in a baby's DNA that alters development before birth)  Multiple pregnancy (twins, triplets, etc.)  Infants who are small for gestational age are at higher risk of experiencing:  High red blood cell count  Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)  Low body temperature  Meconium aspiration (when a newborn breathes meconium or stool and amniotic fluid into the lungs)  (when a newborn breathes meconium or stool and amniotic fluid into the lungs) Neurological injury    Large for Gestational Age  ""Large for gestational age"" is a term referring to a fetus larger or more developed than average. Babies with a birth weight above the 90th percentile are considered large for gestational age.  If your fundal height exceeds the average, your baby may be large for gestational age. You may also be further along in pregnancy than previously estimated.  Possible causes of large gestational age include:  Gestational diabetes  Maternal obesity  Excessive pregnancy weight gain  Babies who are born large for gestational age are at a higher risk of experiencing:  An injury during childbirth  Shoulder dystocia (when a baby's shoulders get stuck during delivery)  Low blood sugar after delivery  Neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission  Risks and Warnings  A fundal height measurement is a noninvasive tool. There is no risk associated with this exam. It is important to note that fundal height is not always accurate and may vary depending on the healthcare provider’s technique, the pregnant person’s weight gain, and other factors.  For this reason, it is important to verify any abnormal findings with an ultrasound immediately. Research estimates that 75% to 90% of fetal growth abnormalities go undiagnosed until birth.  Summary  Fundal height is a measurement taken during pregnancy to monitor fetal growth. Fundal height measures the distance between the pelvic bone and the top of the uterus in a pregnant person. It determines if your baby is growing as expected.  Fundal height is measured in centimeters and is usually started around 20 weeks of pregnancy. It may be used to assess your baby for small or gestational age (SGA) or large for gestational age (LGA). If your measurement is abnormal, your provider will recommend an ultrasound exam.  "

A BBC Newsnight investigation has found scammers are using Facebook to find willing participants and claim to have “helped” thousands of women with the move, which helps the child to get UK citizenship and the mother a residency route.  Facebook told the BBC such content was banned by its rules.  A BBC researcher went undercover, posing as a pregnant woman who was in the UK illegally, and spoke to people offering the services.  One agent, who went by the name Thai, told her he had a number of British men who could act as fake fathers and offered a “full package” for £11,000.  He introduced the undercover researcher to a British man called Andrew, who he said would pose as a father and would be paid £8,000 from the total fee, the BBC reports.  A child is automatically British by birth if a migrant woman is in the UK illegally but gives birth to a child fathered by a British citizen or a man with indefinite leave to remain.  The mother can then apply for a family visa, which will give her the right to remain in the UK and apply for citizenship in due course.  Last year, 4,860 family visas were granted to “other dependants”, a category that includes those applying to stay in the UK as parents of British children.  Deliberately giving false details on a birth certificate is a criminal offence.  The Home Office told the BBC it had measures in place to prevent and detect immigration fraud using false birth certificates.  The BBC was told that the practice occurred in many different migrant communities including those from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nigeria and Sri Lanka, and had been happening for many years.  The investigation found that the illegal practice was advertised widely on some Vietnamese Facebook groups for jobseekers.  Meta, the company that owns Facebook, told the BBC it did not allow “the solicitation of adoptions or birth certificate fraud on Facebook”. It said it would continue to remove content that violated its policies."

Citing preliminary data from its Vital Statistics Report, the PSA said births last year totaled 1.25 million, declining by 8.2% from 1.36 million tallied in 2021.  The Calabarzon (Cavite-Laguna-Batangas-Rizal-Quezon) Region had the highest registration of birth, accounting for 15.6% or 195,795 of all births nationwide.  This was followed by Central Luzon with a 12% share (149,939) and capital region Metro Manila’s 10.1% (126,471).  However, Calabarzon’s birth tally last year was lower by 4.2% annually compared with 204,333 in 2021. Registered births in the National Capital Region (NCR) also contracted by 21.4%.  Preliminary vital statistics data from the PSA showed deaths from January to December reached 622,509, falling by 29.2% from 879,429 in 2021.  Calabarzon also accounted for the highest registered deaths with 15.1% of the total deaths last year at 94,084. This was lower by 32% from 138,298 recorded in 2021.  It was followed by Central Luzon with a 12.1% share at 75,397, and NCR with 11.4% at 70,801.  Meanwhile, registered marriages climbed by 12.5% year on year to 401,388 last year from 356,839 in 2021.  Calabarzon had the highest share of registered marriages at 15.2% with 60,831, followed by Central Luzon, 11.8% share or 47,273 and NCR’s 11.8% or 47,245.  The information in the vital statistics report was compiled from tallies generated by city or municipal Civil Registrars during the period, consolidated by the PSA’s Provincial Statistical Offices and then submitted to the Office of the Civil Registrar General as of Feb. 28.  CAUSES OF DEATH  In a separate report, the PSA said that ischemic heart diseases were the leading cause of deaths in the country with 114,557 cases in 2022. This is equivalent to 18.4% of the 622,509 total deaths listed in the January to December period.  Neoplasms diseases were the second-highest cause of death with 63,377 (10.2% share), followed by cerebrovascular diseases with 63,281 (10.2% share).  Meanwhile, deaths due to COVID-19 totaled 17,011 in 2022, declining by 84.9% from the 112,772 deaths registered in 2021.  Deaths associated with COVID-19 are classified into those with the virus identified and not identified at the time of death.  COVID-19 with virus identified accounted for 12,085 or 1.9% of total deaths. Taken by itself, this category would be the 11th leading cause of death during the period.  Some 4,926 deaths due to COVID-19 fell into the “virus not identified” category, accounting for 0.8% of total deaths, or 23rd overall.  According to the PSA, data on COVID-19 deaths were based on death certificates received and certified by health officers of local government units. — Lourdes O. Pilar"

I’m Kaitlyn, and I’m one of the new members of the Gorilla Care Team. While I’m one of the newest humans on the team, I am not the newest addition in the gorilla building. I’m so excited to be sharing about the newest member of our gorilla family, Willie B. III, and how his family is responding to his arrival.  We welcomed the first baby of parents Shalia and Willie B., Jr., on April 24, and I can certainly say there is no better way to begin a new job. The Gorilla Care Team was pleasantly surprised by his arrival, as we were expecting him to make his debut in May. Shalia made childbirth look like a walk in the park! She was not only calm, cool, and collected all morning preceding his birth, but also remained that way throughout the day and gave birth with no complications, surrounded by her troop. As a new mom myself, I was in awe at her resilience and natural ability. Gorillas really are some of the most amazing animals.  Shalia isn’t new at motherhood, as this is her second baby, but for the rest of her troop, these are uncharted waters. New father Willie B., Jr. has remained cautiously interested in the small bundle that never leaves Shalia’s arms – something many new fathers can relate to. At first, the new dad was hesitant to be in the same space as the infant and would observe only at a distance. Recently, however, we have noticed him observing from much closer and even appearing to lean in and gaze directly at the baby. This of course has caused many happy tears and squeaks of joy from the humans on the team. It’s momentous to experience Willie B., Jr.’s journey into fatherhood, not only because he’s a favorite of most of his care team, but also because of the legacy the birth of his son continues.  You may be wondering how “aunties” Kambera and Amari are reacting. This birth is important for many reasons, but one of them is the opportunity for the other girls to experience infant rearing. Motherhood is hard enough without having to learn on the job, so for gorilla troops, it’s important for females to be able to gain experience from watching their mothers and troop members raise babies. We are hoping that Kambera especially shows interest in Willie B., III, so she can learn from supermom Shalia and will be ready to care for her own infant when the time comes. Amari was immediately interested in the baby and began following Shalia around on day one. She can often be found peering over Shalia’s shoulder and watching as the baby sleeps or nurses. Mom is very tolerant of Amari’s interest, but will gently redirect her if Amari comes too close. Kambera didn’t show much interest to begin with, but she has recently began sitting closer to Shalia and sneaking peeks at the baby when she thinks no one is watching her. She can pretend not to think Willie B., III is the cutest thing she’s ever seen, but we all know you love him too, Kambera!  Keep an eye out for more updates on our newest family group as we continue to watch them all adjust to this new life. Stop by Gorilla Habitat 4 on your next visit and you’ll be sure to spot proud mom Shalia cradling her bundle of joy.  Kaitlyn K.  Keeper II, Primates"

Thank you for turning to WORLD Radio to help start your day. Good morning. I’m Mary Reichard.  NICK EICHER, HOST: And I’m Nick Eicher. Coming next on The World and Everything in It: adoption law and ethics.  Today, we launched Episode 5 of Effective Compassion. It tells the story of adoption from a legal perspective, circumstances where a child is removed from a home because of abuse or neglect and permanently placed with another family. That’s when a judge gets involved to help decide what’s best for the child.  REICHARD: But what about adoption by choice? When birth parents voluntarily place a child for adoption? The courts don’t typically get involved in those situations. But lawyers do. Today, WORLD reporter Jenny Rough talks with an adoption attorney who has dedicated her life to walking families through the process.  JENNY ROUGH, REPORTER: In 1883, a Christian businessman from New York opened the first Florence Crittenton home. He wanted to provide shelter for unwed pregnant women, and share the gospel with them. In the decades that followed, Crittenton homes spread to major cities across the country.  BARBARA JONES: You know, back in those days, they would whisk the girls away from school or wherever. It was kind of shameful if she was pregnant before she was married.    Barbara Jones lives in Clifton, Virginia. Her home is located on a former Crittenton farm. The pregnant women lived in a dormer home on the back of the property.  JONES: And they planted in the garden, and they actually worked on the farm. And then, after the babies were born, they went back to their life.    The babies were adopted. It’s fitting that Jones lives there now. She works as an adoption attorney.  JONES: It is a boutique specialty. I gravitated into it very quickly after I obtained my law license and just fell in love with it because it’s family oriented.    In the greeting area of her office, every wall is covered with photos.  ROUGH: Are these all the babies?    JONES: No, they’re some of them. The reason is now people do digital pictures.  Depending on the case, Jones works with birth parents and adoptive parents.  JONES: Representing a birth parent is painful, because there’s sorrow in separating from her baby, probably the hardest thing she’ll ever do. Representing adoptive parents, high anxiety, but great joy when they’re placed.    A stack of old newspapers sits on her conference table. Thirty-five years ago, when Jones first started practicing adoption law, matches were made through the classifieds 1-800 numbers.  JONES: Here’s a classified ad. Virginian-Pilot. Come to adoption. Sam and Sue wish to adopt healthy newborn child. Will pay legal, uninsured medical.    Now, those who hope to adopt advertise online. Either directly through word-of-mouth networking, or through an agency.  Adoption lawyers like Jones advise birth mothers of the law and help them think through what they want.  JONES: She can complete a hospital plan. A nursery consent, stating who could come into the nursery and hold and feed her baby. Who she wants in the delivery room. Does she want pictures?    She also helps birth moms fill out forms for medical history, family history, social history. Authorization releases and oaths that affirm the information is true.  One of Jones’ most important duties: helping the birth mom obtain the consent of the birth father. This can be harder than it sounds.  JONES: “I was drunk at a party,” we hear way too much. Sometimes there are girls prostituting or sex trafficking.    Jones has encountered many cases where the birth father is unknown.  JONES: And if a mother says, “I don’t know who he was. He said his name was Dave or Tripp,” You know how many Daves there are in Virginia?    State laws vary. But today, over 35 states, including Virginia, have a system in place to help track down fathers.  JONES: We implemented the birth father registry so we didn’t have to chase men in dark alleys at night, and we could say, “Hey, we’re representing Susie Smith. Step up now.” We want to protect fathers if they want to parent, but they need to step up in the window of time.    Adoptive parents also have a lot of paperwork. Most notably, a home study. An intensive process that involves everything from a criminal records check to biographical history.  So that’s the law of adoption. But what about ethics? Adoption scams are becoming more common. Historically, it was considered ethical for hopeful adoptive parents to cover some expenses for the birth mom—medical and pregnancy-related expenses, like maternity clothes. But in some states, it’s now the norm for adoptive parents to cover living expenses for the birth mom. Thousands of dollars a month.  JONES: Often I'll get a call from some of the states in the west and they'll say, well, what is your birth mom's budget? If she comes in here and it’s all about money.    Jones’ antenna goes up! The practice can be coercive on both ends. The pregnant woman might feel coerced to give up her child, even if she wants to legitimately change her mind, if the adoptive parents have been sending money. And adoptive parents may feel coerced to keep paying lest the birth mom go off and find someone else. Some states have implemented laws to guard against that.  JONES: Virginia is very restrictive. You can pay living expenses for the birth mom, but only if her doctor writes a note and says she cannot work due to medical complications or reasons of the pregnancy.    Finally, Jones draws up post-adoption contracts. An agreement between the parties to stay in touch through letters, pictures, and visits.  JONES: Oftentimes the birth parents like that. They know they picked a good family, they like them, but they’re just so afraid they’ll separate and that family will forget them. We will type it up, and we put the terms that the parties have agreed. They might do two visits a year. Birth parents may send gifts. The adoptive parents will send videos and pictures, whatever they agree upon.    Birth mothers do have time to change their minds. How long again, varies by state. Maryland is one the longest at 30 days.  JONES: And then in Virginia she has 7 days to revoke.  ROUGH: Okay.  JONES: No matter what. It’s a very small percentage that change their mind after the mom goes home and the baby goes out the door with the agency or the family.    When the time period to revoke passes, the child is adopted, welcomed into a new family, with the family’s full name, identity, and rights.  To this day, Jones tries to carry on the history of her property as a safe haven.  JONES: There’s peace in this place, and I know there was much prayer that went on here. And sometimes my clients will come in and say, “This place is so peaceful.” And I just feel like the Lord was here ahead of time.  Reporting for WORLD, I’m Jenny Rough in Clifton, Virginia.

What You Need To Know Clearwater residents Kaitlyn and Tim McCallum began to notice a shell-like growth on back of their newborn son, James    A pediatric dermatologist in Orlando diagnosed James with giant congenital melanocytic nevus    Doctors have completed the removal process and now they’ve started a series of procedures to replace the bad skin with good skin      View photos of James' journey below  Kaitlyn delivered James in August, 2021. When he came out, there was a scabby growth on his back.  “(It was) terrifying, to say the least,” Kaitlyn said. “Right when he was born, it was pretty flat. There was a bump by his neck, there was a lump.”  “That’s kind of concerning, when you have medical professionals and they’re telling you they’ve never seen this before,” said Tim, who said doctors were initially puzzled.  As the McCallum parents searched for answers, struggling with the uncertainty, the growth increased in size, becoming lumpier and fattier. The spots grew darker, the texture became fleshier and the exterior grew hairier.  The growth began to resemble a turtle shell, with Kaitlyn and Tim adopting the nickname of “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle” for their toddler.  “We try to give him any superhero nickname, because that’s what he is to us,” Kaitlyn said.  Unfortunately, the shell-like growth also began to hinder James’ life. He couldn’t sleep on his back, which is a safe sleep practice for babies, and his head and neck movement became more and more restricted.  Finally, a pediatric dermatologist in Orlando offered a diagnosis: A giant congenital melanocytic nevus.  It’s a large patch of skin, often described as a mole or a birthmark, which presents at birth or develops in a baby’s first year. It is usually not harmful, though it can develop into cancer or become dangerous if it reaches the brain or spine. Thankfully, in James’ case, it was cumbersome, but harmless.  “Getting that diagnosis of ‘Okay, here is what It is, here’s who you can go to, here’s how we’re going to fix it,’ that was the moment of, ‘Okay, we can do this,’” Kaitlyn said.  Doctors began the removal process when James was six months old, starting with the lump by his neck and then moving down his back to remove the bulk of the shell. Now, they’ve started a series of procedures to remove the bad skin and replace it with good skin. A specialist at the University of Chicago is spearheading that work.  When it’s all over, doctors hope James will be left with nothing more than a scar. His parents know their turtle-shell hero will have a story to tell and they’ll look back on the strength it took for all of them to endure this birth surprise.  “I’ve learned how strong you can be and how much a mother can do for a kid,” Kaitlyn said. “Just keep staying strong. There’s an end to this and we’re almost there.”"

Thurza Blagg, from Nottingham, was rushed to hospital when she began bleeding whilst on holiday on the Greek island.  The 32-year-old, who is 28 weeks pregnant, is desperate to return home where she feels she can give birth safely. However, Ms Blagg says her insurance company AXA missed a chance to repatriate her, resulting instead in an urgent transfer to Alexandra hospital in Athens.  She said due to the language barrier and receiving little support, she does not understand what is happening with her baby. ""I don't feel very safe, I don't feel like I've got a clear birth plan,"" she said.  The UK government said it was supporting Ms Blagg and is in contact with local authorities. AXA has stated it was crucial to ensure any decision made was the right one and, after carefully reviewing her case, it is providing her with the medical assistance she needs.  On May 6, Ms Blagg went to Rhodes with her mum Kim, who was celebrating her 60th birthday.  Ms Blagg said it was an attempt to ""get away from it all"" after her partner - and dad to her unborn baby - Paul Ahad took his own life in January. ""This baby that I'm carrying now is really important because it's the only piece of my partner I've got left,"" she said.  She received a fit-to-fly letter ahead of her trip, but on May 12, just two days before she was due to return, she began bleeding. After being rushed to Rhodes General Hospital, Ms Blagg was told her waters had broke. She was given medication to delay the birth and contacted AXA so she could arrange a flight home.  Due to it being the weekend the insurance company were unable to acquire the necessary information from her GP. Instead, in a letter seen by Nottinghamshire Live, it said Ms Blagg could sign a medical disclaimer saying she would be liable for payment if she did not ""fall within the terms of your policy"".  However, after sending the signed documentation, Ms Blagg said AXA failed to organise her flight before the decision was made to move her to Athens. ""I should've been sent home but they basically ignored that,"" she said.  ""They left me in a hospital for 12 hours without neonatal facilities. Time was running out and a decision had to be made.  ""There was an opportunity for me to return home to receive the appropriate care. I did everything they asked, it isn't about money, I want my baby to be alive, healthy and safe. I'm scared and I want to go home and understand what's happening to my baby.  ""It's not like the UK here, it's hard to understand what my condition is. There is a massive language barrier, when they're saying medical terms and I'm carrying my first full term pregnancy, it's hard to understand what's going on.  ""I don't feel very safe, I don't feel like I've got a clear birth plan. They're changing my sheets today for the first time, I haven't been offered any food or water, my mum has to buy it all.""  She added that she was assessed in plain view of other patients and their visitors. ""People's boyfriends could be there and staff will rip off my pants to have a look at me, there's no curtain or privacy. I feel highly vulnerable.""  Ms Blagg is still in contact with AXA and the British Embassy, who she hopes will help her return to the UK. ""It's mine and Paul's baby, it's all I've got left of Paul,"" she said. ""I feel pressurised and I don't feel safe.""  Her mum, Kim, who has remained by her side throughout, said: ""It's been disgusting, shocking and frightening. It's been an awful ordeal and because of there being limited visiting hours I've had to fight to stay in the room with her. We've had no support whatsoever, the insurance company has been terrible.""  A spokesperson for the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said: “We are supporting a British woman hospitalised in Greece and are in contact with the local authorities.”  An AXA Partners spokesperson said:“We are very sorry to hear about Ms Blagg’s circumstances and we sympathise with her situation. Due to the complex nature of her condition, we have a duty of care to ensure any decision we take is in her best interest.  ""Therefore, it was essential for our medical team to obtain and review Ms Blagg’s full medical history in order to determine the appropriate next steps to ensure she receives the right level of care. Following a review of this information, we will provide her with the medical assistance she requires.”"

The Casper actress shares son Freddie with ex-husband James Heerdegen. The then-couple welcomed son Freddie in 2014, nearly a year after tying the knot. Ricci filed for divorce from the dolly grip in July 2020; in January 2021, Us Weekly confirmed that a judge ordered Heerdegen to stay 100 yards away from the actress after she accused him of domestic violence. Heerdegen was also stripped of his visitation rights with their son.  Following the duo’s split, Ricci moved on with Hampton in July 2021. In August 2021, the twosome shared that they were expecting a little one together. After tying the knot two months after announcing the exciting news, the pair welcomed daughter Cleopatra in December 2021.  “My heart has exploded,” the hairdresser said alongside a photo of the newborn. “@riccigrams and baby Cleo are doing fantastic.

I didn’t realize that it is all or nothing.”  The Sleepy Hollow star also took to social media to gush over her husband as a father and stepdad.  “Happy Valentine’s Day to the kindest, most fun, generous, most imaginative and brilliant man I have ever known,” Ricci gushed in February 2022. “You are of the best examples of your species and frankly, a unicorn 🦄(No wonder our little girl is crazy for them) 🦄You take care of us and love us in a way I never thought possible.

In 2014, after the birth of my first child, I fell into a deep and dark hole. Food tasted like cardboard. My body buzzed with anxiety. I would beg my husband not to leave me alone with our colicky baby girl. I felt like I’d made a terrible mistake. I wasn’t cut out to be a mother.  What I didn’t realize was that this wasn’t motherhood: this was postpartum anxiety and OCD, and I was paralyzed by my symptoms. One night my husband persuaded me to attend a local support group for moms. I was skeptical. How could these moms help? But I got there and I saw, well, just a bunch of moms. They looked normal. They weren’t “crazy,” and some of them were even getting better. And it wasn’t like a light switch turned on, but slowly I found some hope, felt less alone, and got on medication because these other mothers normalized taking medication as a tool for recovery. I am positive that the group saved my life.  Once I recovered, I became a volunteer for Moms Supporting Moms (MSM), a local organization, then the program coordinator for MSM, and now I am the Support Groups Manager for Postpartum Support International, an international non-profit. I’ve focused on supporting pregnant and postpartum parents for the last eight years, and I’d like to share some of the resources that I have learned about along the way.  The Triangle area has a wealth of resources to support moms, birthing people, and new families during one of life’s biggest transitions: having a baby.  mental health challenge is the #1 complication from childbirth and that 15-20% of moms experience anxiety and/or depression during pregnancy and/or postpartum (the perinatal period). While these challenges are common, they are also very difficult. In honor of Maternal Mental Health Awareness Month, I want to highlight the resources we have for expectant and postpartum parents. We know that experiencing aand that(the perinatal period). While these challenges are common, they are also very difficult.  In the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill area, there are so many organizations, businesses, and providers who are ready to help and trained in perinatal mental health. The three main tools for supporting pregnant and postpartum moms who are experiencing anxiety and/or depression are medication, therapy and peer support. All of those tools are available in our area:  The UNC’s Center for Women’s Mood Clinic in Chapel Hill has an inpatient psychiatry unit dedicated to pregnant and postpartum people. North Carolina is home to 1 of 3 units like this in the entire country. At the UNC Women’s Mood Clinic, pregnant and postpartum moms in a mental health crisis can find expert, inpatient care, which is a rarity in our nation. Anchor Perinatal is an outpatient intensive program focused solely on perinatal clients. Moms (or parents) can receive therapy and support group sessions from therapists trained in perinatal mental health and then go home to their families each day. Anchor also has a free, walk-in clinic for screening for perinatal mood challenges. The founding therapists are all extensively trained in perinatal mental health. This is an amazing resource! Moms Supporting Moms (MSM) is the longest running, free peer support group for pregnant and postpartum moms in the Triangle. Moms Supporting Moms meets every Thursday evening (virtually), so that moms can join together and know they are not alone. MSM also provides free, volunteer mentors to new moms. An experienced mom volunteers to guide a new mom through the first-year of her baby’s life. Support groups and mentors help fight against the stigma of perinatal mental health challenges, and the connection MSM provides is a wonderful tool to help moms get on the road to recovery. Equity Before Birth (EBB) serves Black families by providing financial support for pregnancy-related services and needs. EBB pays birth workers and educators to support pregnant black birthing people. We know that this type of support can save lives and can help decrease physical and mental health complications. Triangle Area Parenting Support (TAPS) provides a 10-week session (virtual) with other new parents in each area of the Triangle, so parents connect with those in their city. The sessions focus on information but also support and connection. These groups can help decrease isolation and increase parent confidence with new skills and education. Sessions are in English and Spanish. Family Connects Durham is a free nurse home visiting program for all parents of newborns, regardless of financial need. Registered nurses support all families in Durham County by providing no-cost postpartum home visits. Nurses can help identify a perinatal mood challenge and connect parents with resources to help them cope and decrease feelings of isolation. Emerald Doulas provides birth and postpartum doula care, support groups and classes. Emerald Doulas have support groups for pregnant parents, new moms, LGBTQ+ parents, and moms of color. HER Health Collective is a supportive community for all moms, with in-person and virtual events to help moms connect. HER also provides women’s health information from experts via their events and podcasts. You can check out my interview on their podcast if you want even more information on perinatal support in the Triangle area. Rosenberg Perinatal & Waypoint Counseling are two group practices focused on perinatal mental health in the Triangle. Rosenberg Perinatal is a group of mental health clinicians supporting the emotional wellbeing of pregnant and postpartum parents, individuals experiencing fertility challenges and adoptive parents. Many of their clinicians also speak Spanish! Waypoint Counseling is a team of mental health professionals with a special focus on postpartum anxiety and depression, birth trauma, NICU parenting, and much more. Waypoint can also help with medication management. MAAME (Mobilizing African American Mothers through Empowerment) empowers Black, Indigenous, and other People of Color during pregnancy and postpartum.

What You Need To Know Clearwater residents Kaitlyn and Tim McCallum began to notice a shell-like growth on back of their newborn son, James    A pediatric dermatologist in Orlando diagnosed James with giant congenital melanocytic nevus    Doctors have completed the removal process and now they’ve started a series of procedures to replace the bad skin with good skin      View photos of James' journey below  Kaitlyn delivered James in August, 2021. When he came out, there was a scabby growth on his back.  “(It was) terrifying, to say the least,” Kaitlyn said. “Right when he was born, it was pretty flat. There was a bump by his neck, there was a lump.”  “That’s kind of concerning, when you have medical professionals and they’re telling you they’ve never seen this before,” said Tim, who said doctors were initially puzzled.  As the McCallum parents searched for answers, struggling with the uncertainty, the growth increased in size, becoming lumpier and fattier. The spots grew darker, the texture became fleshier and the exterior grew hairier.  The growth began to resemble a turtle shell, with Kaitlyn and Tim adopting the nickname of “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle” for their toddler.  “We try to give him any superhero nickname, because that’s what he is to us,” Kaitlyn said.  Unfortunately, the shell-like growth also began to hinder James’ life. He couldn’t sleep on his back, which is a safe sleep practice for babies, and his head and neck movement became more and more restricted.  Finally, a pediatric dermatologist in Orlando offered a diagnosis: A giant congenital melanocytic nevus.  It’s a large patch of skin, often described as a mole or a birthmark, which presents at birth or develops in a baby’s first year. It is usually not harmful, though it can develop into cancer or become dangerous if it reaches the brain or spine. Thankfully, in James’ case, it was cumbersome, but harmless.  “Getting that diagnosis of ‘Okay, here is what It is, here’s who you can go to, here’s how we’re going to fix it,’ that was the moment of, ‘Okay, we can do this,’” Kaitlyn said.  Doctors began the removal process when James was six months old, starting with the lump by his neck and then moving down his back to remove the bulk of the shell. Now, they’ve started a series of procedures to remove the bad skin and replace it with good skin. A specialist at the University of Chicago is spearheading that work.  When it’s all over, doctors hope James will be left with nothing more than a scar. His parents know their turtle-shell hero will have a story to tell and they’ll look back on the strength it took for all of them to endure this birth surprise.  “I’ve learned how strong you can be and how much a mother can do for a kid,” Kaitlyn said. “Just keep staying strong. There’s an end to this and we’re almost there.”"

Of the five delivered by Siddhi on May 4 three have died and two are still alive. As per Akansha Mahajan, the Director of Delhi Zoo, Siddhi last gave birth on January 16, 2005.  Sharing details with the media, Mahajan said that while Siddhi was born in the wild and brought from Nagpur’s Gorewada Zoo, the father of the cubs, Karan was from Mysore Zoo and born in a zoo. The father is 10 years old and the mother is six.  Siddhi is attending to the two cubs and the zoo authorities are constantly monitoring their condition.  At present NZP has four adult Royal Bengal Tigers and their names are Karan, Siddhi, Aditi and Barkha. Aditi like Siddhi is of wild origin and was acquired from Gorewada.  Last year in August, three white tiger cubs were born at NZP after a gap of seven years. In December one of them died and the other two – Avani and Vyom – were released into an enclosure for public viewing last month.  Besides the six golden Royal Bengal tigers including the cubs, the Delhi Zoo houses five white tigers, taking the total number of tigers at NZP to 11.  NZP has been housing tigers since the inauguration on November 1, 1959. From then on Delhi Zoo is maintaining its population for conservation, education and display. Tigers have bred well in Delhi Zoo and also given in exchange to many zoos of the country and abroad.  The Zoo is part of the planned conservation breeding programme being run by Central Zoo Authority since 2010."

Today is the International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia, and Transphobia, and the Slovak government needs to be aware that the world is watching and will not be silent if the country violates people’s human rights. Rado Sloboda, Director of Amnesty International Slovakia  “Today is the International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia, and Transphobia, and the Slovak government needs to be aware that the world is watching and will not be silent if the country violates people’s human rights.  “This law will gravely impact the rights of transgender people, forcing them to reveal their gender assigned at birth in everyday circumstances, such as signing for parcels. It will increase the risk of bullying, discrimination, or violence, and impact the right to privacy. This bill should not pass.”  Background  The National Assembly of the Slovak Republic is due to vote on Bill No. 301/1995, also known as the Birth Number Act which, if adopted, would force transgender people to prove they have the ‘correct’ set of chromosomes to have their legal gender affirmed. The act regulates birth numbers, the personal 10 digit identifier given to everyone in Slovakia on the day they are born. It includes information about the date of birth, and numbers for two genders – women are given the number 5, and men the numeral 0. The birth number must be changed to have your gender legally affirmed, but the law would effectively make this impossible, as most transgender people don’t have chromosomes matching their gender identity."

Share this page on Facebook Share this page on Twitter Share this page on LinkedIn Email this page to a friend Print this page  When John Somers arrived to compete at the PGA Professional Championship in late April, he had more than golf on his mind. In fact, just days before, Somers did not know if he would even be able to play.  Somers, who played at Elon from 2009 to 2014, became a father for the first time two days before flying to New Mexico to play in the tournament. John and wife Catherine, another Elon alumna, welcomed daughter Colbie on April 25, just five days before the event was scheduled to begin.  The due date for Colbie’s birth was May 17 but Somers said the early birth was a “blessing in disguise” as it meant he would no longer have to worry about missing her birth while competing at a tournament. After spending some time in the neonatal intensive care unit, Colbie was able to come home with no health issues, which gave Somers the peace of mind he needed to compete at the PGA Professional Championship.  “I wasn’t even expecting to play,” Somers said. “It had always been on my mind, am I going to miss the birth of my baby? It worked out where the baby came and I got to be there with my wife and then welcome my little girl knowing that my wife and the baby are healthy and she’s got a huge family support system, which made me very comfortable and know that I can go out there and play golf and not have to worry about anything.”  Somers works as the head PGA professional at the Southern Hills Plantation Club in Brooksville, Fla. Among his duties include golf shop and staff oversight and running tournaments hosted by the club.  The PGA Professional Championship is a tournament for golf club professionals and teachers who are members of the Professional Golfers’ Association of America. This year, over 300 players competed, with the top 20 finishers earning spots at the PGA Championship, one of the four major tournaments in men’s golf.  During one of his practice rounds in the leadup to the tournament, Somers wrote Colbie’s name on a golf ball to honor his first daughter. However, he quickly had to alter his tribute upon teeing off.  “I lost it on that same hole and I felt so guilty and so bad about it,” Somers said. “I was like, maybe a golf ball’s not a thing to do. So, I started writing it on my glove right below my thumb so that way I can always see it. It’s just a really great tribute for her and hopefully, I can make her proud.”  After shooting a 68 in both the second and third rounds, Somers shared the 54-hole lead. Although he did not win the tournament after a final-round 73, Somers easily secured a spot in this week’s PGA Championship by tying for fourth.  Somers said he did not have a chance to reflect on qualifying for the PGA Championship following the round due to his media obligations and thinking about seeing his family.  “I was just so focused on getting back home and being with my daughter and my wife. It wasn’t really until probably Saturday or Sunday when I started getting all the emails and I’m looking at flights and hotels,” Somers said. “That’s when it kind of hit me like, oh man, I’m actually doing this. I’m playing a major.”  A graduate of Bartlett Yancey High School, located just over 30 minutes from Elon, Somers had a prolific college career with the Phoenix. He was named the team’s most valuable player in both 2013 and 2014 and won the 2014 Coca-Cola Wofford Invitational. He credited his time at Elon for helping him develop as a player.  “College golf is always special because it’s really your last time for a lot of people to experience a team atmosphere,” Somers said. “I made lifelong friends. We played some great golf courses. I had two great coaches with Bill Morningstar and Don Hill. It definitely shaped me into the player I am today.”  Somers has played tournaments on the PGA Latinoamerica and the Korn Ferry Tour, the direct feeder tour for the PGA Tour, but this will be his first appearance at a major championship. The event will be held at Oak Hill Country Club in Rochester, New York, on May 18-21. The course has hosted six major championships, including three PGA Championships, most recently in 2013.  To prepare for the event, Somers said he has spent time watching highlights from the 2013 PGA Championship and other videos overviewing the course. Despite this being his first appearance in a major, Somers said he has high expectations for the week.  “I’d love to win it,” Somers said.”That’s the thing I always tell myself – don’t enter a tournament unless you want to win it.”  Somers will play with Christiaan Bezuidenhout and Chez Reavie, who have combined to win six tournaments on the PGA and DP World Tours, in the first two days. They will tee off in the opening round on Thursday, May 18, at 1:14 p.m. and on Friday, May 19, at 7:49 a.m. The tournament will air on ESPN, ESPN+ and CBS throughout the week."

In 1928, Nazrul’s trainer at the Gramophone Co was Dhiren Das . Over the years, their bond strengthened so much that Nazrul felt an urge to write a four-page-long poem on their relationship.The poem’s original manuscript has not come in the public domain before. Das’ son Arabinda had donated the manuscript for preservation at the Jiban Smriti Archive. On Nazrul’s birth anniversary that will be celebrated on May 26 this year, the manuscript will be on display for the public.Founder of the archive Arindam Saha Sardar said, “Das, who was an accomplished singer, was also actor Anup Kumar’s father. This year, Das family gifted this manuscript to us. I am immensely grateful to Arabinda Das for trusting us with the preservation job. This is not just a personal document but a national treasure. It has Kazi Nazrul’s own handwriting.”Das had joined as a trainer at the Gramaphone Co. in 1924. Later, the likes of Bimal Dasgupta and Tulsi Lahiri joined the music company too. “In 1928, K Mullick gained popularity by singing ‘Bagichae bulbuli tui’. When asked about the identity of the songwriter, he mentioned Kazi Nazrul Islam. One day, Mullick chanced upon Nazrul somewhere near Rajabazar and introduced the Gramophone Co. officials to him,” said Das’ son, Arabinda.On persuasion. Nazrul agreed to sign a contract with the Gramaphone Co. According to this contracts, Das’ responsibility was to learn the songs from him and then teach them to others. This process continued for long and soon the duo became great friends. What endeared Nazrul to Das further was the latter’s ability to memorize a song quickly. “He used to address Baba as ‘shrutidhor’. Kazi Jyathamoshai , as we referred him, would say: ‘If Dinu Thakur is Tagore’s ‘kandari’, Dhiren is my ‘gaandhari’ because he can retain my gaan (songs) in his memory. Baba was the first outsider to set Nazrul’s songs to his tunes. The tunes of his songs – ‘Kaalo meyer payer tolae’ and ‘Aar lukabi kothae Maa Kali ’ – that have become popular were composed by my father,” Arabinda said.Not just creative collaborations, Das also came to Nazrul’s aid when the latter had problems finding accommodation. “That was because of his religious identity. Baba got him an accommodation next to our house on Hari Ghosh Street,” Arabinda added.It was very natural for Nazrul to want posterity to know about this friendship. That’s why both decided that Nazrul would write a 14-stanza-long poem on their relationship and Das would set it to tune. But the poem never turned into a song. The untitled poem has Nazrul’s signature."

Madeline Kaklikos, 24, was diagnosed with a rare condition called uterus didelphys after she and her husband Jon, 27, spent a year trying to have a baby naturally.  Uterus didelphys – where a woman is born with two uteruses – affects just 0.3% of the population. This meant that Kaklikos had both two uteruses and two cervixes.

During this scan, to their astonishment, the doctor told Kakliko and her husband that there was another baby showing, but that this baby was in her other uterus.  Kaklikos gave birth to twins Nate and Cole in February this year. (Caters)  “I thought she must have been joking with us,” Kaklikos recalls. “The second baby was measuring smaller than the first, so it's suspected that we conceived another baby spontaneously the week after our transfer.  “Medics told me that this was a one in 50 million pregnancy because Nate was in one uterus and Cole was in the other, and they had also been conceived in different ways and at different times. Nate was conceived through IVF and Cole was a spontaneous pregnancy.”  Kaklikos says that she and her husband were in such shock after they were told they were having two babies, they both sat in silence for 20 minutes.

Despite being the ""Hardcore Legend,"" Foley is well-known for being a family man and someone who cares for others, which he has often been praised for over the years.  ""She had to spend most of the day resting, and so I asked Eric if I could have the time off.

""He granted me the time off.""  The break was something that Foley appreciated as he made it clear that telling the story was a thank you to WCW. Being able to have a break at the time of his daughter's birth is something that a lot of professional wrestlers aren't able to have.  ""When I came back we were able to do some pretty good business,"" he said. ""And I was able to be there when Noelle was born.""

Alayna Holt, 71st Comptroller Squadron commander, was the first at Vance Air Force Base to use the expanded military parental-leave program for Airmen and Guardians.  Following the birth of her daughter in early December 2022, Holt, and her husband, Maj. Zachary Jarvis, 71st Security Forces Squadron commander, were grateful to be a part of a team that fully supported their caregiver leave.  Although Holt and Jarvis became parents before the new policy became effective, Dec. 27, 2022, senior leadership at Vance Air Force Base approved caregiver leave in the spirit of the new policy.  The updated policy authorizes birth parents 12 weeks of caregiver leave following a health-provider recommended period of convalescent leave.  “It’s such a special time to bond with your new child and figure out how to be a first-time parent,” said Holt. “I’m thankful that I took that time.”  Under the previous policy, birth parents received six weeks of caregiver leave following their convalescent leave. But if caregiver leave was not taken immediately after the birth of a child it would be lost.  Non-birth parents received only 21 days of caregiver leave compared to the new policy which authorizes non-birth parents 12 weeks of caregiver leave following the birth of their child.  As a male caregiver, it’s a positive step forward from only 21 days of caregiver leave, said Jarvis.  “The policy is well written in that the leave can be taken in segments of seven days at a time,” said Jarvis. If mission requirements prevent taking the full 12 weeks at once, it can be spread out after the birth of the child.  “Leadership at Vance was supportive of taking ordinary leave in conjunction with my wife’s caregiver leave,” said Jarvis. “We were able to go back home and introduce our daughter to the family. The extra time gave us the opportunity to secure childcare once we returned to work.”  “The bond between a child and a parent is special and those first few months are critical to the formation of a bond that will last a lifetime,” said Col Jay Johnson, 71st Flying Training Wing commander. “I think the new policy is a step in the right direction and will have a positive impact on recruitment and retention.”  “Find what works best for your situation,” said Holt. “If that is not taking all 12 weeks at the same time, that’s okay. But take advantage of the great benefits we have.”  Holt was initially skeptical about being able to take off so much time from work, especially as a squadron commander. But she realized the importance of setting a precedent.  “I reached out to a fellow squadron commander at a different base who had a child a couple of weeks after I did,” said Holt. “She was in the same boat as me, unsure about taking so much time off.”  Both Holt and Jarvis felt it was important to demonstrate the value of what the Air Force was offering parents. “If I’m taking my caregiver leave, I’m showing my folks that it is important,” said Jarvis. “And I expect them to take caregiver leave when that time comes for them.”  Holt and Jarvis are optimistic that their Airmen will see that if their commanders can utilize the new policy, so can they.  “The right thing to do is to take this time to be with your family, because at the end of the day, at the end of the year, at the end of your career, your family is still going to be by your side,” said Holt. “However long you choose to serve, at the end of that time, you want your family there.”  “Major Holt and Major Jarvis are setting a fantastic example for Team Vance Airman to follow,” said Johnson. “They’ve proven that we’ll continue to do what we’ve always done, rally around each other to balance the demands of service to our country and obligations to care for our families.”  “I think the new policy shows we are committed to Airmen,” said Jarvis. “We recruit Airmen but we retain families.”"

The young cat was struggling with her labour - a stillborn kitten was stuck in her birth canal - and she needed to undergo a caesarean section.  Under surgery she was able to give birth to four of her kittens, although another was also stillborn.  RSPCA animal rescue officer Melanie Froude says the cat, who has been named Lily, looked to have been well cared for before her surgery and while she is not microchipped the officer is appealing for her owner to get in touch or for anyone who may know of her background.  “It was very fortunate that someone noticed this poor cat struggling by the side of the road. The lady realised she was in difficulty and took her back to her home in nearby Dodleston before calling us,” said the animal rescue officer.  “We were able to give Lily the care she needed and she gave birth to four kittens, who are doing well.  “On the basis of her appearance she doesn’t look like she is a stray. I made door-to-door enquiries at properties near to where she was found and I put up a few posters as well.  ""So far no-one has come forward, but maybe someone is worried about the whereabouts of their cat? Or someone might know who the owners of this lovely, friendly cat are, and I would urge them to get in touch.”  After recovering from her surgery at a private boarding cattery, Lily is due to go into the care of RSPCA Bryn-y-Maen Animal Centre in Colwyn Bay. She will be rehomed if an owner does not come forward.  Anyone with information is asked to call the RSPCA appeals line number on 0300 123 8018."

She stated that nurses are present in every community, large or small, urban or rural, providing competent care from birth to death, emphasizing that ""nurses' responsibilities span from direct patient care and case management to implementing quality assurance procedures and overseeing complex nursing care systems.""  Ms. Enchill's remarks came during the weekly ""Your Health! Our Collective Responsibility,"" a Ghana News Agency Tema Regional Office initiative aimed at promoting health-related communication and providing a platform for health information dissemination in order to influence personal health choices through improved health literacy.  The Ghana News Agency's Tema Regional Office established the public health advocacy platform ""Your Health! Our Collective Responsibility"" to investigate the elements of four health communication approaches: informing, instructing, persuading, and promoting.  Ms. Enchill stated that as part of commemorating the 2023 International Nurses Day, nurses care for injuries, dispense drugs, conduct frequent medical checks, and record thorough medical histories.  She believes that nurses are the cornerstone of the health professionals since they monitor heart rate and blood pressure, do diagnostic tests, operate medical equipment, draw blood, and admit and discharge patients depending on physician orders.  She did, however, underline that, despite their role, nurses' efforts are not always recognized by patients and their families inside the health sector, and she pushed for a paradigm shift.  ""Without the contribution and active work of a nurse, no other professional in the health sector can operate; we are the engine in general health delivery, and we must be accorded the due recognition and appreciation,"" said the IMaH Registered General Nurse.  Mr. Samuel Adu Ntiamoah, also a Registered General Nurse at IMaH, contributed to the conversation by underlining the significance of nurses in the healthcare profession.  He argues they are the first point of contact for a patient at the hospital and the last person they see before leaving.  The nurse, according to Mr. Ntiamoah, directs the patient ""to see the doctor and attend the laboratory,"" making them the hospital's heart.  Speaking about patient rights, Mr. Francis Ameyibor, Tema Regional Manager, Ghana News Agency, remarked that a patient has the right to privacy regarding his or her medical condition.  He discovered that communication and compassion foster trust between patients and caretakers, increasing their overall satisfaction.  ""Patients are also more likely to adhere to their treatment recommendations when they are given more information and respect,"" he continues.  Mr. Ameyibor pushed for concerted efforts to educate the people on how to care for and conserve the environment, respect the rights of other patients and health providers, and use and not abuse the health care system responsibly.  He praised nurses for their crucial role in people's total well-being from birth to death, as well as their work in some of the most difficult environments in the country.  —CDA Consult II Contributor"

Recently, astronomers utilised this telescope's cutting-edge technology to observe a distant star-forming galaxy, delving into its intricate structure with unprecedented detail.  Discovery of the Galaxy  Harnessing the capabilities of NASA's billion-dollar observatory, the James Webb Space Telescope's Orbiter Spacecraft has unveiled the stellar composition of GN20, one of the earliest-known galaxies in the universe. Situated a staggering 12 billion light years away, this captivating discovery represents a luminous and dust-laden star-forming galaxy of extraordinary brilliance.  Significance of the Galaxy  What makes GN20 particularly intriguing is its relatively recent formation, occurring a mere 1.5 billion years after the cataclysmic event known as the Big Bang. Positioned within a region of space referred to as a protocluster or galaxy overdensity, this area holds astronomers' fascination due to its eventual culmination in the formation of colossal galactic clusters.  Insights into the Galaxy's Structure  The captivating image captured by the James Webb Space Telescope allows us to peer back in time when the universe was a mere 1.5 billion years old, as it stands at approximately 13.5 million years presently. Astonishingly, this ancient galaxy boasts a star formation rate approximately 1,860 times greater than the mass of our Sun each year. Astronomers, under the guidance of Luis Colina from the Spanish Astrobiology Centre, employed the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) to examine GN20's structural properties during November 23-24, 2022.  Findings of the Study  Analysis of the MIRI images unveiled a clumpy molecular gas surrounding the galaxy, forming a colossal disk spanning about 46,000 light-years in diameter. Furthermore, the measurements indicated that the galaxy comprises a diffuse gas envelope encompassing a densely packed nucleus of shimmering stars. Remarkably, the nucleus spans a mere 2,600 light-years across, while the gaseous envelope extends approximately 23,000 light-years.  About the James Webb Space Telescope  James Webb Space Telescope stands as NASA's most prominent and powerful space science observatory. Boasting a large infrared telescope with a primary mirror of around 6.5 metres, this state-of-the-art instrument represents a monumental leap forward in our quest to understand the cosmos. It has been positioned a million miles out into space. It orbits the Sun and not the Earth."

Now the leading cause of death of children under 5, prematurity is an urgent public health issue. Every year, an estimated 13.4 million babies are born preterm (before 37 weeks of pregnancy) while an even higher number - over 20 million babies - have a low birthweight (under 2.5 kg at birth). For these babies, KMC is a proven, effective intervention for saving lives and improving their health and development.  “Kangaroo mother care is one of the most critical, lifesaving measures to improve the survival prospects and wellbeing of babies born early or small,” said Dr Anshu Banerjee, Director for Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health at WHO. “Ensuring mothers and babies everywhere can stay together and practice kangaroo mother care immediately after birth will require a radical rethink of how maternal and newborn care is organized - these new publications aim to support this process.”  The two publications - a global position paper and implementation strategy - seek to enable the expansion of KMC within health facilities and at home, globally. They follow the release of landmark new guidelines published last year, which recommend KMC as the essential standard of care for all preterm and low birthweight babies, starting right after birth. The new documents highlight that it should be available both for babies that are well and sick - for at least eight hours a day – including in intensive care.  “For most health facilities, achieving the widespread adoption of kangaroo mother care for all preterm or low birthweight babies will require fundamental changes in newborn care provision, especially neonatal intensive care,” said Dr Shuchita Gupta, Medical Officer at WHO who coordinated the development of the new documents. “This includes changes to the physical layout of care facilities, that enable the mother to stay with her small and sick baby inside the newborn care unit on a 24/7 basis. It also means changing the way healthcare is provided so that obstetricians, midwives, paediatricians, and nurses work together in harmony to care for mothers and babies in one place, as a unit.”  KMC has been shown to significantly improve survival and health outcomes for preterm and low birthweight babies, compared to clinical stabilization in a more ‘high-tech’ incubator or warmer. In fact, data shows it can increase preterm survival rates by as much as a third, reduce infections, prevent hypothermia, and improve feeding and growth. It is also empowering and reassuring for mothers and families who take a leading role in providing care for their infants.  Despite these benefits, only around a third of countries are estimated to have an updated policy or guideline on KMC, meaning millions of preterm and low birthweight babies are likely to be missing out on this lifesaving technique.  The new documents outline some key actions that should be taken to enable the wider adoption and implementation of KMC:  Governments should recognize and include KMC as essential care for all preterm or small babies, ensuring it is financed and monitored – including the necessary infrastructure changes within hospitals - as part of national programmes. Additional parental leave and entitlements can help address the special needs of caregivers of preterm or low birthweight infants so that they can provide the requisite care.  Facilities and healthcare providers should help ensure small and preterm babies can benefit from skin-to-skin contact with their mother for the recommended 8-24 hours a day, starting immediately after birth. Critically, both mother and newborn should receive respectful care, together, as a unit - even when the infant is sick and requires care inside the newborn care unit. Parents and caregivers should be involved in routine care and all aspects of decision-making around care for their newborns. They should be supported – with coaching, emotional and practical assistance - to provide KMC for their small and preterm babies.  Partners and family members can help in providing KMC, providing relief for the mother, stepping in if she is unwell, and helping meet her needs while she is caring for her baby.  Developed in collaboration with a multi-country, multi-stakeholder working group, these resources are directed to governments, programme partners, policy makers and the broader public health community, to help countries expand KMC for babies born early or small. Around the world, WHO is providing ongoing assistance in implementing and scaling up KMC as the foundation of small and/or sick newborn care within national maternal, newborn and child health programmes.  Editor’s note:  The Working Group that developed these documents is comprised of various scientific experts, Ministries of Health and representatives from UN agencies (UNICEF, the World Bank, WHO), bilateral agencies (USAID, Japan International Cooperation Agency -JICA, Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation-NORAD, the Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office of the United Kingdom- UK-FCDO), donor organizations (Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF), Laerdal Foundation), parents groups (European Foundation for the Care of Newborn Infants, FUNDAPREMA, Preemie Connect), professional associations (the American Academy of Pediatrics,, Council of International Neonatal Nurses (COINN), the International Confederation of Midwives, the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO), the International Pediatric Association), and non-governmental organizations (Kangaroo Foundation, Médecins sans Frontières, Save the Children) and specialized partnerships like the Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health."

The child, born May 13, 2022, is named RZA Athelston Mayers, according to a copy of a birth certificate obtained by the Daily Mail and People.  RZA (pronounced rizz-uh) is also the performing name of Robert Fitzgerald Diggs, the main and founding member of legendary Staten Island hip-hop group Wu Tang Clan. Neither Rihanna or the baby’s father, rapper ASAP Rocky, have commented publicly on their child’s name.  ASAP Rocky, whose real name is Rakim Athelaston Mayers, was also named after hip-hop royalty. He and his sister Erika were named after the Long Island hip-hop duo Eric B. & Rakim, according to 2011 profiles from Pitchfork and Complex.  ASAP Rocky, who grew up in Harlem, has recalled being raised around hip-hop in multiple interviews. Along with other major acts of the 1980s and 1990s, he regularly names the Wu-Tang Clan as among his musical influences.  “I grew up listening to Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, DMX, UGK, Three 6 Mafia, Wu-Tang Clan, everybody,” he told Complex in 2011. “My mum and dad, they came to an agreement and they both named me after Rakim. Honestly, I can’t even meet that guy, man. That would be so crazy.  “I was thinking about naming my child Kanye,” he added with a laugh. ASAP Rocky has collaborated with Kanye West, who now goes by Ye, throughout his career.  Rihanna first revealed she was pregnant with RZA in January 2022 with an Instagram shot of her midsection and ASAP Rocky’s hand resting on her arm. Since giving birth that May, the Grammy-winning singer and business magnate has mostly kept the child from the public eye, sparingly sharing videos of RZA to social media.  She first introduced her son in a TikTok in December and posted a second video in April.  Before posting publicly about her child, with his name still under wraps, Rihanna was asked about her privacy in a November interview with the Associated Press.  “We just didn’t get around to it yet, really,” she said. “We’ve just been living. But I guess there’s a certain freedom that comes with kind of just like getting it out there.”  As rumours swirled of a second child, Rihanna revealed she was pregnant shortly after performing at the Super Bowl LVII halftime show in February.  The Lift Me Up performer and ASAP Rocky are not the first set of famous people to name their child after other famous people.  Fergie and Josh Duhamel, who have since divorced, reportedly named their son, Axl Jack Duhamel, 9, after Guns N’ Roses frontman Axl Rose.  Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon, who have also divorced, named one of their 11-year-old twins, Monroe Cannon, after the late actor Marilyn Monroe, one of Carey’s inspirations, according to ABC News.  David and Victoria Beckham took a more literary route, naming their child, Harper Seven Beckham, after To Kill A Mockingbird author Harper Lee, according to the Guardian. – Los Angeles Times/Tribune News Service"

The Derry City and Strabane District Council candidate said she’s “delighted” to announce the birth of baby Bennett in recent days as she thanked the “amazing Community Ante-natal Team” in Strabane.  ""I will still be contesting the election in two days’ time, and hope to get back to my campaign soon,” she added.  ""The fact that I have given birth so close to the election will make for a great story for Bennett when he's older.”  Aontú leader Peadar Tóibín TD welcomed the “most fantastic news” for all involved in this campaign.  ""With politics there is always a lot of negativity, especially so close to the finish line, but this brilliant news reaching us, of the birth of baby Bennett, has put a smile on all Aontú faces across the island, and given us all a fantastic boost of happiness.  ""In congratulating Leza and her family, I want to pay tribute to her hard work in this campaign. Leza Houston is a working student, currently studying Law in Ulster University.  ""She lives in West Tyrone with her young family. Leza’s passion for human rights motivated her to get involved in politics.  ""She is particularly passionate about children’s rights and improving her community for children in this area. I hope to see her elected in a few days’ time!""  Aontú selected Leza Houston to contest the Derg DEA, West Tyrone in the upcoming local election.  She is a working student, currently studying law in Ulster University. She lives in the Glebe with her five children.  Ms Houston said Aontú is a movement that is dedicated to the Human Right to life of everyone, the unity of Ireland and economic justice for all in society.  Speaking at the time she was selected, she added: “I believe in the traditional Republican vision that all the children of the nation should be cherished equally.”  Mrs Houston continued: ""I am especially frustrated with what’s happening to my county of Tyrone. The cost of living crisis is hurting so many families.  ""That people are going without food and heat while the political establishment are sitting on their hands in Stormont is not good enough.  ""We are calling on MLAs to lose their salaries if they won't do their job. It would not be tolerated in any other walk of life.  ""We are also calling for the end to the system where any one party can crash the Assembly over and over again or block the Assembly from functioning and we want to devolve economic power from London to Belfast so Stormont can actually help people here."""

The Director, Vital Registration, Mathew Sunday, disclosed this to our correspondent on Tuesday.  It would be recalled that the United Nations Children’s Fund, on Friday said only 33 per cent of children in Nigeria have birth certificates.  UNICEF’s Chief of Kano Field Office, Rahama Farah, stated this during a stakeholders’ meeting on birth registration organised by UNICEF in collaboration with the NPC in Kano.  Farah, represented by the Senior Education Specialist, Michael Banda, said, “The Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey MICS 2021 shows that about one in every four births of Nigerian children aged under five years are not registered. According to MICS 2021, only 33 per cent of these registered children have a birth certificate.”  Giving updates on the efforts thus far by the NPC in ensuring that children in Nigeria get registered at birth, Sunday said, “We are collaborating with the health sector, especially the Primary Health Care. We are going to have a meeting very soon with all the stakeholders in the health sector. We are going digital.  “We are automating the processes of childbirth registration to ensure that there will be no double registration and for the purpose of probability. We are working with other sister agencies such as the Federal Ministry of Health and the National Bureau of Statistics because sharing data on the analogue platform is very difficult.  “A lot of children are born outside medical facilities, especially in rural areas. One measure that we have adopted is that we have found out that these children are immunised, irrespective of where they are born.  “We have been collaborating with the health sector for years but it is not enough. We are now moving into integrating birth registration into the health sector activities. For instance, on the immunisation card of a child, one will see a column if a child is registered and if not, the health personnel will advise the parents to go register the child.”"

Toiréasa had been feeling some pains throughout the night on Tuesday so, when Barry came down ready for work, she told him to stay off so he could be close in case anything happened.  Toiréasa said: “I phoned the hospital in the morning but I was told to keep an eye on things for the meantime. We decided to go for a walk and lunch in the Sandwich Company at 1pm. I was feeling more pains at this stage so we went to see the midwife in the Hub and she checked me over and told me to keep an eye out for waters breaking and to stay close to the hospital.”  Advertisement Hide Ad  Advertisement Hide Ad  “I thought we had plenty of time,” said Barry. “So I decided to go for a haircut because I couldn’t go to the hospital looking like I did.

He just wouldn’t take his eyes off me and was crying and barking really loud as if he was asking for help. He knew something was wrong before we really did.”  Advertisement Hide Ad  Advertisement Hide Ad  Barry added: “When I came back, I told Toiréasa I was away to the toilet downstairs and to shout if she needed anything. I gave her some paracetamol and a glass of water and told her just before I left the room that we can go to the hospital whenever she needed to, I was just going to take care of business first.”  The layout of the house meant that while Barry was in the downstairs toilet, he wasn’t able to hear much of what was going on upstairs. He said he heard some ‘commotion’ but thought his wife was just going to the upstairs toilet. He opened the door and shouted to his wife but heard nothing back so he decided to go investigate.

I got to the top of the stairs and Toiréasa greeted me at the door with a baby.”  Advertisement Hide Ad  Advertisement Hide Ad  Toiréasa said: “I’d say I was grey and Barry was opaque! For me, as soon as Barry went downstairs, I realised I needed gas and air soon. I started being sick, which made my waters burst. I could feel pressure and all I could think of was how I was going to walk to the car with so much pressure. I was screaming for Barry but I don’t know if there was actually any sound coming out. The next thing, the dog somehow burst through the stairgate and managed to push open the heavy fire door into the bathroom and then the baby was out. I came out of the bathroom door holding the baby and met Barry at the bathroom door. I was telling him to phone quick and he said ‘phone who?’  ""We were on the phone to the 999 operator and she made Barry get a clean shoelace and plenty of towels. She told us what to check with her breathing and everything else. The ambulance crew arrived shortly and they were really lovely. They made us really feel at ease and they blue lighted us to Altnagelvin. I was given a private room on arrival because the midwives said it was the least I could do after delivering my own baby. Everything was well with the baby so we were back home again almost exactly 24 hours after she was born.”  Barry is feeling ‘overwhelmed’ by the whole experience but says he is immensely proud of his wife, his new daughter and, of course, the dog. “I’m so proud of Toiréasa and how she handled the whole situation. I’m sad I missed the birth itself but I also think it was probably for the best. Toiréasa would have been comforting me if I had’ve been there with them! She knew what she had to do and she knew no one was coming to help her in that moment because I was attending to other things.

Inspired by Southern cooking, Forbidden is the culmination of nearly a decade of work by Eaves to capture the essence of an elegant mature bourbon achieved by nontraditional low-temperature fermentation.  ""Total creativity involves a certain degree of rebellion. To be completely creative, I tend to do things that are a little bit forbidden,"" said Eaves, who has fully controlled the distillation, aging and bottling of Forbidden from grain to glass. ""While creating Forbidden, I have had the freedom to cross deep into uncharted territory by using nontraditional ingredients and techniques. The resulting bourbon, on my palate, is perfection.""  Photos are available to download photos here.  The first release of Forbidden is a small batch, hand-blended 5-year-old bourbon bottled at 95.2 proof. This bold and elegant expression is beautifully balanced and complex. Forbidden's unique blend of cuisine-quality white corn, white winter wheat and malted barley give it a sweet and smooth profile. Darker notes balance Forbidden and originate from both charred barrels and fruity, floral yeast. Aroma leads with vanilla bean and crème brûlée, dried fruit, hazelnut, light sweet citrus notes and gentle layered spice. The palate: caramel, citrus oil and delicate floral along with baking spices, oak sugar, soft chewy sweet with a hint of grain. The finish lingers creamy sweetness with oak and spice.  ""With Forbidden, we've taken our time to create something completely original in Kentucky bourbon,"" said Daniel Rickenmann, who is one of the new brand's four South Carolina-based partners along with Eaves in Kentucky. ""Forbidden is a bourbon you finish and say, 'This is my first drink and my last drink of the evening.' It's a symphony of flavor, complexity and warmth.""  Story continues  Rickenmann adds about Eaves, ""Marianne's preoccupation with achieving such a high level of work means she doesn't follow the usual script. For nearly two decades, Marianne has steadily stepped outside of the norm in her career and with her work to create Forbidden, she defies every expectation.""  Distilled, aged and bottled at Bardstown Bourbon Company by Marianne Eaves, Forbidden will be available initially in these states: Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia and South Carolina and online at an SRP of $129. The first release will include a highly allocated number of hand-blended bottles along with three single barrel cask strength expressions.  About Forbidden Bourbon  Forbidden Bourbon is a completely new approach to the world's only uniquely American spirit. In Marianne Eaves, Forbidden's South Carolina-based founders saw an artisan distiller who was willing to challenge the industry and pursue perfection. Together, they've cultivated a partnership that is rewriting the rules for how bourbon is made: from char and fermentation to blending and bottling. Forbidden is the result of nearly a decade of defying expectation to see what's possible in bourbon. Learn more at ForbiddenBourbon.com.

While Moakler has reportedly not had the best relationship with her youngest child, she has made multiple attempts to find and build a connection between them. In a recent effort, the reality star uploaded a throwback image that she used to announce Alabama’s arrival into the world in 2005. She shares the teen with her ex-husband and musician Travis Barker.  Shanna Moakler Threw It Back To The Day She Announced The Arrival Of Her Baby Girl  It is not throwback Thursday yet, but December 24, 2005, will always hold a special place in Moakler’s as it was the third time she would become a mother. Even though the Miss Teen USA 1992 rep had welcomed two other kids — Atiana De La Hoya and Landon Barker, she was still ecstatic to hold the adorable chub in her arms.  To announce the big news, the doting mom created a Hollywood-inspired poster featuring the newborn sporting a serious look in the middle. Alabama was donned in a long-sleeved outfit, a blanket, and a head warmer.  Above her were numerous statements expressing joy, such as “2 thumbs way up!” “The cutest baby ever!” “She’ll laugh, she’ll cry, she’ll mess up her diaper!” and “Put her on your “must see” list for 2005/2006.”  The announcement banner also included a five-star rating for the tot, along with her full name, date and location of her birth, her weight at birth, and the doctor in charge of the labor. “She had the coolest birth announcement ever lol,” the enamored Moakler wrote under the pic, which she shared via her Instagram Story.  The Rhode Island native had most recently tried to work on her and Alabama’s tumultuous bond by trying to get her hooked on one of her favorite pastimes, gaming. Per The Blast, the mother-of-three had taken time from her busy schedule to play video games with the 17-year-old.  She shared evidence of their excellent time through an image that showed the teenager lying on a couch with headphones on her head. The Internet personality wore a pink and white striped two-piece set that could pass for pajamas for the occasion.  She finished her pose by throwing the peace sign at the camera, concealing her mouth and nose from view. However, the bits that could be seen showcased her slightly made-up face, consisting of a barely noticeable winged eyeliner.  Alabama’s hair was also styled perfectly, tucked under what appeared to be a multicolored bonnet. Tagging her, her mother penned, “I’m making a gamer out of her 😂😂😘,” across the image.  The ‘Search Party’ Celebrity Contestant Slammed Travis Barker’s New Wife On Her Birthday  Anybody who has recently followed the news is well aware of the tension between Moakler and Travis’ current wife, Kourtney Kardashian. However, in case you are unaware, the former Playboy Playmate of the Month has never shied away from airing her dislike for the Poosh founder publicly, and she did so again during the latter’s 44th birthday festivities.  The moment occurred after she uploaded a photo of herself wearing makeup following the premiere of her ex-husband and Kardashian’s wedding special, “Til Death Do Us Part,” in April.  “I hope that you get a huge apology some day for what was said on that exploitative, money grabbing, circus,” one fan had commented under the post, earning a like from the “Pacific Blue” series regular.  A second person had then chimed in, “Also kourtney wrote on twitter she’s now a mom of 6,” referring to the three children the D-A-S-H co-owner shares with ex-partner Scott Disick — Mason, Penelope, and Reign — in addition to her husband and Moakler’s three kids.  The “Friends ‘Til the End” star promptly responded, “she post more of my kids then [sic] her own lol.” She had previously taken a swipe at another Kardashian, when a fan mistook her for Khloe.  At the time, the netizen had written, “Literally thought that was Khloe Kardashian!” under another Instagram post. Moakler did not hesitate before dropping, “khloe doesn’t even look like khloe what are you people smoking lol.”  Judging by the amount of likes the reply received; it is clear that people shared the same sentiment and were glad to see it finally said."

Emma Taylor, 33, from Chelmsford, was around seven months pregnant when she was rushed to hospital after collapsing one evening in October 2022.  Emma was taken straight into A&E where doctors examined her and said Emma needed to deliver her baby immediately. But soon after the birth, doctors found Emma had a bleed on the brain, and she was airlifted to Queen's Hospital in Romford, where they discovered she had a huge tumour at the base of her skull.  Emma's partner Scott Weeks, 47, spoke to EssexLive, saying that October 13 began as a normal day, but soon descended into chaos. While out buying some bits and pieces for the baby, Emma was suddenly hit by a severe headache and told Scott she was going to have to go to bed to sleep it off.  Read more: Essex woman, 22, with 34H breasts denied NHS reduction surgery due to BMI  But at around 7pm that evening, Scott heard a thump: ""She was sprawled out on the floor, she literally looked like she'd fallen out of bed."" Emma was slurring and said she couldn't move her left side. Scott said: ""That sent alarm bells ringing as I thought, oh my god, this is much more serious than I thought.""  He and a neighbour eventually drove Emma to Broomfield Hospital, as Scott was told an ambulance would take four hours to arrive. She was soon examined by doctors, who told Scott Emma was going to have to deliver her baby immediately.  (Image: Scott Weeks)  Emma and Scott's daughter Ophelia was born at 9.08pm on October 13, and while she was a little small and had a slight breathing problem initially, she was healthy. Scott said: ""I was thinking, this is not quite what we'd planned. Our visions of us leaving hospital together in the usual romantic way with the baby seat and whatnot, suddenly that dream was decimated.""  The doctors came back and said Emma had a bleed on the brain. Scott said: ""That's never a pleasant thing. I remember just sitting there thinking, what the hell is happening. I have never felt so parched in my life.""  Scott continued: ""I felt sorrow for the fact that Emma was not only missing the events but she was potentially in a place that was going to take her out of her daughter's life for a fair while."" Broomfield Hospital isn't equipped for the specialist neurological treatment Emma needed, so she was airlifted to Queen's Hospital in Romford.  Scott said: ""She had another scan and it wasn't a pretty sight."" Emma had a tumour around 60mm long that had grown around the base of her skull and was wrapped around the spinal column underneath her brain.  Scott said: ""It was really kind of 50-50 whether she was going to make it through the night because they said the bleed could be so brutal they potentially couldn't do anything with her."" But by the next morning, Emma had stabilised and they were able to operate the next day.  (Image: Scott Weeks)  On Tuesday, November 1, Emma had surgery and two-thirds of the tumour was removed. The surgeon said Emma had not sustained any brain damage and the tumour was found to be non-cancerous.  Scott said: ""The surgeon predicted a sound recovery. With dedicated physiotherapy he saw that she should be able to live a relatively normal life with some impairment to her left side ability.""  After a few weeks, Emma started breathing by herself again and was moved off the ICU ward and back to Broomfield Hospital. It was while Emma was back at Broomfield that Scott remembers bringing Ophelia in for a dietitian appointment, and Emma had regained consciousness.  Scott said: ""It was an absolute miracle as the surgeon had said that consciousness would be her biggest hurdle because of the damage."" He explained that the right-hand brainstem, which had been damaged by the tumour, was like the brain's 'starter motor'.  Scott continued: ""So without that she could have been unconscious for the rest of her life, and that would have been it."" Emma was moved to Northwick Park hospital in north London, where she started a three-month rehabilitation programme funded by the NHS.  Emma has already made some progress in the months of rehab she's had. Emma was mostly paralysed from the neck down, but she's slowly started to regain some dexterity again, moving her thumb and fingers, then her toes.  Scott said: ""It's a very slow process. The frustrating thing is they say the rehabilitation for this kind of injury can be two years. Three months is not really enough to get someone back on their feet.""  (Image: Scott Weeks)  Emma has now been moved to a 'soft rehab', which is far less intense in supporting her recovery. Scott said: ""My problem with that is yes, eventually she should make the recovery we hope for, but it's just delaying the amount of time she's missing with her daughter. And I just didn't feel like that was a fair trade off.""  Scott says these first six months of bringing Ophelia up without Emma has been tough. He tries to involve Emma as much as he can with Ophelia, from letting her choose Ophelia's clothes to where their daughter should go to nursery.  But due to visiting times, Emma can only see Ophelia for a couple of hours a week, so Scott tries to keep Emma up to date by showing her lots of photos and videos. Scott says: ""Emma's very aware of what's going on and what she's missing. She does cry, we have some tears.""  At the moment, Emma still is unable to speak, but communicates through nodding and shaking her head, and can put her thumb up or down in agreement or disagreement. Scott said: ""She wants to be given the best shot of speeding up the process [of recovery].""  Scott has started a fundraiser to pay for Emma to continue more intensive physiotherapy privately, so she can come home in less than 12 months, he hopes. There has been a huge amount of local support, partly because Emma was so well-loved by everyone in Chelmsford, Scott said.  He said: ""She was a dedicated local dental hygienist and she'd been serving in Essex for over 10 years. I guess I'm just looking to get her the same kind of treatment she's given her patients over time.  ""I've had hundreds of them come to me and say she's amazing and donated, and that's really what I think she deserves."" Scott added: ""It's amazing that in times like this, when we put our heads together, we can achieve amazing things.  And not a lot of money from a lot of people can make a huge difference to this girl's life and her daughter's."" The fundraiser has only been running for a couple of weeks, but Scott has already raised more than £55,000 for Emma's rehab.  Emma is a very calm and caring person, Scott said, and always thoughtful and considerate of everyone around her. Scott said: ""She's a very well-liked person, and missed by everybody.""  A spokesperson for the London North West University Healthcare NHS Trust, which runs Northwick Park hospital, said: “Hyperacute rehabilitation units (HRUs) are highly specialised and patients are moved on once their medical condition is stabilised. Their ongoing treatment is not determined by resources and the handful of hospitals trusts hosting HRUs work closely with their local continuing healthcare teams to ensure their on- going rehabilitation in accordance with their needs.”  You can donate to the fundraiser here.

A woman who attempted to hide more than three pounds of cocaine under a fake pregnant belly has been apprehended by law enforcement officers. In the process of evading the authorities, the contraband fell out of the rubber belly that was allegedly attached to her.  So in a way, she gave birth to over 1,500 grams of cocaine.

During The Traffic Stop  During a proactive patrol on April 12th, officers from the Anderson County Sheriff's Office pulled over Anthony Miller and Cemeka Mitchem, residents of Charlotte, while traveling along Interstate 85. The reason for the stop was attributed to Miller's erratic driving behavior, as he drove haphazardly, crossing lanes of traffic and nearly colliding with a semi-truck.  Public Information Officer, Shale Remien, told ABC News that Miller and Mitchem appeared apprehensive during the stop and went out of their way to inform officers that Mitchem was pregnant. Nevertheless, conflicting information regarding her due date, as well as differing details about their intended destination, alerted officers to the possibility of criminal activity.  ""The first red flag began when the two gave conflicting information about her 'due date,'"" the release from the office said.  According to police, Mitchem fled from the officers as they grew increasingly suspicious of the ""conflicting story"" offered by the couple, and in the process, drugs fell out of a rubber stomach she had been carrying.  ""Mitchem immediately took off running and very quickly drugs fell from the fake rubber stomach,"" the release noted.

Even if you focused on one mom, you probably assumed she was confident and knew how to handle her baby. After all, she's the mom and she knows what the baby wants and needs.  Then you gave birth, and you found that motherhood came with some uncertainty, fear and confusion. Sometimes, you feel that you don't always know what your little baby wants and how to satisfy their needs.  Now you know that behind every mom with a stroller or a baby carrier were long minutes of necessary organization, many things that they're not allowed to forget, and maybe even a wish that this short trip will pass without hysterical crying, diaper surprises or any stressful comments from unknown passersby.  Now a week, two weeks, or a month after giving birth you may be ready to go out with your newborn child. It can be to the baby development clinic, to the post office, for a scheduled activity or just to get fresh air. Regardless of where it is you’re going, every outing requires you to be organized physically and mentally. In order to have a great time with your baby, look at this guide.  Equip yourself with what you need, but don't overload  You won't be out for long, so don't take the entire house with you. Yet, there are some basic things that are important to have in your stroller bag, even for half an hour of walking around:  Woman walking with stroller (illustrative). (credit: Wikimedia Commons)  A few diapers, two disposable diaper pads, cream, wipes and plastic trash bags.  Clothing: dress the baby in clothes suitable for the weather and always remember to take a change of clothes with you because there will be times the baby manages to poop all over his body. It will happen, albeit hopefully not too often.  Clean blanket  Feeding: Make sure to have a blanket you can wear when nursing, a bottle of water and a can of formula with a measuring scoop. Always take extra; you might be delayed in your return home.  Two pacifiers and some small toys for them to hold while you change them.  A carrier to store in the bottom of the baby carriage or pushchair. An activity mat or blanket suitable to use outdoors.  Don't forget to look out for yourself  And it's true that the baby requires most of the things you’ll be taking with you, but don’t forget that you need a few things too.  Take with you:  A charged phone, wallet, keys and water bottle  Snacks if you don’t want to sit in a cafe  Hand sanitizer  Take into account that the baby will cry  All babies cry. Obviously, it's great if a baby sleeps or is in a good mood, but it’s entirely possible that something will upset them, and you’ll need to respond.  First- breathe deeply. Even if you don't manage to quickly calm down the baby, no one's looking at you. Block out background noise and concentrate only on you and the baby.  Plan a route but be open to changes  In order to remain calm, the first time you take the baby out, choose a route you know. Don't walk on narrow streets or those filled with pedestrians, or go places you know are too steep.  For a first walk go to a park, or quiet streets near your home. You can deviate from the planned route and walk more but remember, however far you walk, you’ll also have to walk back with the baby.  Track the weather  Winter? Make sure it isn't too cold or rainy. Summer? Don't go out if it's really hot and humid. Stay in if it's hazy or very windy.  Don't be afraid to breastfeed outside  At first, nursing in public seems impossible but you'll get used to it. Still, take a blanket to cover you and don't worry if anyone sees you nursing.  Good luck with going out with your baby, especially the first few times. You're a champion mom and everything will be fine!  This article was written in cooperation with the JAMA parenting app."

It seeks to understand how these cosmic events can influence a person’s life based on their birth date and time.  The concept of assigning different symbols for each month dates back centuries, with many ancient cultures believing that certain stones, flowers, or colors have special meanings and powers. This tradition has been passed down through generations and continues to be embraced by people around the world today.  For example, each birth month is associated with a specific flower that represents qualities that are believed to reflect the personality traits of individuals born during that month. These flowers vary from delicate lilies for those born in May to passionate roses for those born in June. Each birth flower blooms in the corresponding month, so be sure to pick a bouquet for yourself during your birth month.  Only The Top 1% Can Ace our Animal Quizzes Think You Can?

January — Carnation and Snowdrop  Carnations are one of two flowers for January. ©Diamant Studios/Shutterstock.com  As we delve into the world of birth month flowers, let us take a closer look at the carnation and snowdrop — two beautiful blooms that represent individuals born in January.  The carnation is known for its delicate beauty and subtle fragrance. This flower can come in a wide range of colors, including pink, red, white, yellow, and even purple. The petals are fringed with a unique texture that adds to their charm.  In ancient times, this flower was believed to have healing properties and was used as a remedy for various ailments such as fever or inflammation. It is also associated with love and admiration; hence it makes an ideal gift for someone you hold dear.  On the other hand, snowdrops symbolize hope and purity. These small yet elegant blossoms bloom during late winter when everything else seems dull and lifeless. They usually appear as drooping white bells accompanied by slender green leaves.  Their sweet scent has been described as having hints of honey or vanilla, which add to their allure.

They often grow taller than violets, with larger leaves resembling rosettes at times. Like violets, primroses are fragrant with scents ranging from sweet floral notes to subtle fruity undertones.

Both qualities fit perfectly into this month’s theme, celebrating romance and renewal.  As far as blooming seasons go, violets tend to bloom early spring through late summer while primroses prefer cooler weather conditions like early spring or fall, where temperatures do not exceed 70 degrees Fahrenheit.

May — Hawthorn and Lily of the Valley  Lily of the Valley flowers smells like honey. ©Agnes Kantaruk/Shutterstock.com  May babies have two birth month flowers to choose from — the hawthorn and lily of the valley. These stunning blooms are not only beautiful but also hold special meanings for those born in May.  The hawthorn is a small tree or shrub that produces delicate white or pink flowers in late spring. Its branches are spiny, and its leaves are lobed, creating an overall striking appearance. In terms of symbolism, the hawthorn represents hope and happiness as well as protection against evil spirits.  On the other hand, the lily of the valley is a fragrant woodland plant with bell-shaped white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. This flower symbolizes humility, sweetness, and purity. It has been used throughout history for medicinal purposes such as treating heart conditions but should be handled with care as all parts of it are poisonous if ingested.  Both these birth month flowers emit exquisite scents that can fill up any room they’re placed in! The sweet aroma of lily-of-the-valley has hints of honey, while hawthorns have notes of citrusy freshness mixed with floral undertones.  When do these blooms grace us with their presence?

June — Rose and Honeysuckle  Roses come in single or double-flowering varieties. ©Isabelle OHara/Shutterstock.com  If you’re a person born in June, your birth month flowers are the rose and honeysuckle.

It comes in various colors, such as red, pink, yellow, white, or even black.  The appearance of the rose varies depending on its species. Some roses bloom with large petals, while others have smaller ones. They also come in different shapes, like single blooms or clusters of buds. One thing they all share, though, is their sweet fragrance which can range from light to strong.  On the other hand, honeysuckles are known for their delicate tubular shape and bright colors ranging from pale yellows to deep oranges and pinks. Their sweet aroma attracts hummingbirds and bees, who help pollinate them so they can produce more flowers.  For those born in June, these two flowers hold special meanings that reflect their character traits. Roses represent love and passion, while honeysuckles signify sweetness and devotion towards family members or loved ones.  Roses typically bloom during late spring through early summer but may vary depending on where you live – some species may be available throughout the year too!

August — Gladiolus and Poppy  Poppies are a symbol of everlasting life. ©MierCat Photography/Shutterstock.com  If you were born in August, the gladiolus and poppy flowers are your birth month flowers. Both of these vibrant blooms have their own unique characteristics that make them stand out amongst other flowers.  The gladiolus flower is characterized by its tall and slender stem with multiple blooms arranged in rows. This elegant flower comes in a variety of colors, including pink, red, yellow, orange, white, and purple. The meaning behind the gladiolus varies depending on the color it bears – for example, pink represents love and infatuation, while white signifies purity and innocence. Typically blooming from the late summer to early fall months (July-October), this hardy plant requires full sun exposure to thrive.  On the other hand, poppies boast their delicate petals, which come in shades of bright reds or oranges with black centers that look like buttons. Symbolizing imagination’s power over death or remembrance during wartime when remembering fallen heroes, poppies’ significance can vary based on culture as well as their location around the world, but they remain one of nature’s most beautiful offerings for those who adore them! They bloom throughout midsummer to early fall (usually June-August), providing an array of colorful hues to gardens around North America.  When it comes to scent, both flowers don’t usually emit any strong fragrance though some varieties may give off a subtle sweet aroma that attracts pollinators such as bees or butterflies towards them.  September — Morning Glory and Aster  Morning glories love to climb up fences and trellises. ©iStock.com/Wakhron  September is a special month for those born during this time as they have not just one but two beautiful birth flowers to celebrate their entry into the world. The morning glory and aster are both stunning blooms that hold unique meanings and significance.

This flower is known for its delicate beauty and symbolizes love, affection, mortality, rejuvenation, and rebirth. It’s also believed to represent unrequited love or even past memories.  On the other hand, asters are small daisy-like flowers with long stems that come in vibrant colors such as pink, lavender, or white. These blossoms commonly bloom from late summer through early fall, when most other plants start to fade away. Asters are associated with wisdom, faith, patience, good luck, valor, and admiration – all great qualities that September babies tend to embody themselves!  While morning glories don’t have much fragrance on their own (unless you get close enough!), some hybrids have been bred specifically for scent purposes. So if it matters enough to you, then seek out these options at your local nursery! On the other hand, asters carry a light floral aroma similar to chamomile tea which is soothing and calming.  Both flowers typically reach full bloom around mid-September, allowing them plenty of time throughout the rest of the autumn season before winter arrives. So whether you choose one type over another – or opt for both together, they are sure to brighten any fall day.  October — Marigold  Marigolds are long-blooming flowers, lasting clear until October in some areas. ©FunFamilyRu/Shutterstock.com  Marigold flowers belong to the genus Tagetes, which includes about 56 species of plants native to the Americas. These bright and cheerful flowers are known for their vibrant color and unique fragrance, which varies depending on the species.  Marigolds typically bloom in late spring or early summer, although some varieties can flower throughout the year. They are characterized by their daisy-like appearance with brightly colored petals ranging from yellow, orange, and red to maroon. The leaves of marigold plants are usually dark green and slightly hairy.  For people born in October, marigolds hold a special significance as they represent love and passion. In many cultures around the world, these flowers are also associated with celebration and joyous occasions such as weddings and festivals.  Apart from their symbolic meaning, marigolds have several practical uses as well. Their pungent aroma helps repel insects like mosquitoes and other pests that could harm garden crops. Extracts from certain types of marigold plants have also been used for medicinal purposes due to their anti-inflammatory properties.  In conclusion, marigolds are not only beautiful but versatile too – they serve both ornamental purposes in gardens while being functional at keeping pests away!  November — Chrysanthemum  Chrysanthemum blossoms are a lovely sight in the late fall. ©Volodymyr Yakovyna/Shutterstock.com  Chrysanthemums are beautiful flowers that come in a variety of colors, ranging from white and yellow to red and purple. They have a unique appearance, with many small petals clustered together in a circular shape.  For those born in November, the chrysanthemum holds special significance as it is their birth month flower. The meaning behind this flower varies depending on culture and context but typically represents optimism, joy, longevity, and good luck.  When it comes to scent, chrysanthemums do not have an overwhelming fragrance, but they do emit a subtle sweet aroma that can be enjoyed up close.  These flowers typically bloom during late summer through fall, which makes them perfect for autumn arrangements or decorations. However, certain varieties, like the Korean chrysanthemum, can bloom even into winter months.  In summary, chrysanthemums are stunning flowers known for their unique appearance and subtle sweetness. Their inclusion as November’s birth month flower adds special meaning for those with birthdays during this time of year.  December — Holly  Holly flowers and berries last throughout winter. ©EveTravels/Shutterstock.com  As we explore the birth month flowers, December brings us the beautiful holly flower. The holly plant is typically characterized by its deep green leaves and vibrant red berries that are often associated with the holiday season. Its appearance exudes a sense of festivity and joy, making it a popular decorative choice during Christmas time.  For those born in December, the holly flower holds significant meaning as it symbolizes strength and protection. This may be attributed to the plant’s ability to thrive even in harsh winter conditions, serving as a reminder for individuals born in this month to remain unyielding amidst adversity.  While not known for their fragrance, holly plants do produce small white flowers that bloom between May and June before maturing into bright red berries later in the year. These berries are not only visually stunning but also serve as an important food source for birds during wintertime when other sources of sustenance may be scarce.  Overall, the holly flower represents resilience and hopefulness — qualities that can inspire those born under its symbolic significance to persevere through challenges while maintaining a positive outlook on life.

We imagine women who come to the United States from other nations — particularly a great many in Latin America, Europe or Africa — asking some version of that question upon learning the pills are not available here for sale over the counter, as they are in 100 other countries around the globe.  Thankfully, this could soon be changing.  An advisory panel of the Food and Drug Administration has recommended that OTC sales of a particular birth control pill be allowed. Though this is only the next step in the process, with the full FDA still needing to sign off, the agency seldom bucks an advisory group’s recommendation.  Sales without a prescription are likely coming soon and that is a good development.  After the Supreme Court last year overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that made abortion legal in all 50 states, the need for women to be able to secure birth control pills as easily as possible became more pressing than ever.  But for far too many women, obtaining pills is anything but straightforward.  The FDA advisory panel has recommended that Opill, a daily contraceptive made by HRA Pharma, be made available for sale over the counter. Though this move involves just one pill, another company that manufactures another birth control pill has also applied for sales over the counter. For the sake of all women, this should be only the start, with other companies offering their own pills following suit, and FDA approval becoming increasingly routine.  This is an issue for all women, but it is of particular importance for those who lack significant financial resources and for women of color. If poorer Black and Hispanic women cannot gain access to birth control pills, while more well-to-do white women can, that’s patently unjust.  Every woman — white, Black, Hispanic, native American, rich, poor, you name it — needs to have access to birth control pills. Without a prescription.  This ought not be controversial."

Giving birth to my third child, I agreed to let five students — in addition to a midwife, my husband, and my parents on Facetime — observe me in this very vulnerable moment, something I couldn't have imagined years before.  8 Kimberly Gladden-Eversley let nine people watch her give birth to her third child Credit: Courtesy Kimberly Gladden-Eversley  8 She admitted she wasn't always so comfortable with her body, but she realized: 'Body positivity starts with me' Credit: Courtesy Kimberly Gladden-Eversley  The body positivity movement has garnered the attention of women around the globe who desperately want acceptance — and yes, I was one of them.  From trendy diets, hour-long Tik Tok-worthy skincare routines, and waist trainers that will suck the life out of you — if you have seen it, I’ve probably tried it.  Despite the efforts of this movement, filtered photos, carefully angled poses, and edited bodies continue to take over our social media newsfeeds — and I admit, I've done it plenty of times.  I was body-shamed for not having note-worthy curves like Beyonce or the voluptuous genes that led to our obsession with plastic surgery.  So here I was, in my early 20s, forcibly poking out what my mama never gave me, hoping to generate likes and approval from an audience who would forget my existence by their next newsfeed scroll.  It wasn’t until seven years ago, when I was in labor during my third pregnancy, that I realized body positivity starts with me.  As I felt like I was splitting in half while I naturally fought through each contraction, my midwife asked if she could invite her med students into my delivery room.  Impressed by my laboring skills, she looked at me and said: “Kimberly, you are doing amazing. Would it be ok if I invite my med students in the room?”  You probably think I would never spread it wide for the world to see and told her: ""No way!""  Well, yes way, and without hesitation, I agreed.  After two back-to-back natural deliveries prior to this one, I felt like a purple-heart medal-wearing veteran ready for battle.  At this point, I could take on anything because fear had officially left the building, and my body had already proven how powerful it was before.  Within minutes, my quiet delivery room turned into a classroom with at least five students staring at my bare body.  Each student walked into the room wearing a permanent smile, exuding nervous excitement while anxiously preparing to witness their first live childbirth.  8 When her midwife asked if several students could come in and watch her give birth, she agreed Credit: Courtesy Kimberly Gladden-Eversley  In between contractions, we’d make eye contact that was complemented by reassuring words of encouragement: “You got this,” “You were so made for this,” “Wow, she is amazing.”  Eagerly standing in my room, we represented beauty in its natural form without an ounce of makeup, fake eyelashes, or selfie-worthy attire.  As I took off each layer of clothing, preparing to bring life into the world, I could feel the insecurities about my appearance quickly slip away.  I didn’t worry about the harsh judgment I’d receive or their thoughts about my body.  I wasn’t as concerned about my disproportionate curves or my nose, which had recently doubled in size as much as I was just a week ago.  I didn’t care about the pregnancy acne I’d cover up before posting with too much lighting and overly saturated filters.  I wasn’t concerned if anyone would pick me apart until nothing was left.  8 'Admittedly, the intensity of the pain increased my disconnection from the world around me,' she said Credit: Courtesy Kimberly Gladden-Eversley  I was too focused on the mission and massively in tune with the present moment, carefully monitoring each stage of labor as it rapidly progressed.  Admittedly, the intensity of the pain increased my disconnection from the world around me.  I probably wouldn’t have cared if Oprah decided to show up with a team of cameras for a feature on The Masterclass.  You probably think I would never spread it wide for the world to see and told her: ""No way!"" Well, yes way, and without hesitation, I agreed.  I felt powerful, called, liberated, and, most importantly, free.  The girl who was called “too skinny” suddenly had hips wide enough to deliver a baby safely and naturally for the third time.  The girl with acne-prone skin that required good lighting and concealer suddenly had skin strong enough to carry a full-term baby.  The girl, whose legs were called sticks, could stand tall, completely nude, while pushing with the help of gravity.  If you're wondering, yes, I gave birth while standing.  8 She sat in a birthing pool with her husband before standing up to deliver her daughter Credit: Courtesy Kimberly Gladden-Eversley  After sitting in a birthing pool for about thirty minutes, supported by my adoring husband, I could feel my contractions getting stronger.  My baby girl’s head was finally making its way further down the birth canal, and after months of research, I decided that gravity would offer me the best assistance.  As I got up, I could sense the hesitancy in the room, wondering if I’d finally gone mad or if my calm demeanor was a temporary act.  I saw random tremoring hands reaching out, ready to assist me from the birthing pool to the bed.  Without giving careful instruction, after I made my way to the bed, which felt like the longest walk ever, I crouched over, using the mattress as my support, and bore down, ready to push.  My midwife got on her knees, ready to catch my baby, and within minutes, her sweet cries filled the room, totaling my delivery time to over an hour and thirty minutes.  Shocked by my speedy delivery, my midwife jokingly informed her students that their short hour in the delivery room was not a typical day for a midwife.  8 'Who knew giving birth to my daughter would also deliver radiating confidence I never thought was possible?' she said Credit: Courtesy Kimberly Gladden-Eversley  The students, who were still speechless from the entire ordeal, managed to thank me for allowing them to bear witness to one of the most vulnerable moments of my life.  Honestly, I wanted to thank them for being there because I needed them more than they’d ever know.  Years of shouting body-positivity affirmations while staring at myself in the mirror, hoping no one would catch me seemingly talking to myself.  Or the times my friends and I would blast songs about women empowerment while singing like an audition for America’s Got Talent.  I probably wouldn’t have cared if Oprah decided to show up with a team of cameras for a feature on The Masterclass  None of it overpowered the hurling insults we’d hear about our bodies that “missed the mark.”  Overall, my level of comfort in my skin took a lot of emotional work and, apparently, physical pain during hours of labor in a crowded room.  Who knew giving birth to my daughter would also deliver radiating confidence I never thought was possible after years of listening to self-help audiobooks on laundry days?  I began to realize I was enough; in fact, I was more than enough to carry life for nine months, to nourish another body, and shockingly, my small breasts were enough to feed my baby for her entire first year of life.  8 Five students, Kimberly's husband, and her parents all watched her delivery Credit: Courtesy Kimberly Gladden-Eversley  Since then, I’ve embodied a sense of unfathomable bravery and was proud of my body from all angles.  I spent less time editing photos, less time working on my pose, and retired my filter button, vowing never to look back.  Let’s face it — after three children, who has time for that anyway?  All the work we put into achieving the picture-perfect body feels like a full-time job that doesn’t pay much.  So, I quit and didn’t give a two-week notice or write a resignation letter.  I proudly shifted jobs for a fulfilling life as a wife, mother, content creator, and gateway for future generations.  Some may falsely assume that my sudden transformation was due to the intensity of birthing pain that can naturally lead to psychological disassociation.  But something happened that day, changing my life forever, which gave birth to my daughter and a version of me that I’ve always aspired to be.  8 Now she's expecting baby number five and said: 'I’ve decided to extend an invitation to my labor and delivery room once again' Credit: Courtesy Kimberly Gladden-Eversley  I was able to experience life beyond fear while remaining present and comfortable in my skin.  My past insecurities were let go with the clothing on the floor that once hid my false perception of beauty.  Fast forward to today, as I prepare for the birth of baby number five, I’ve decided to extend an invitation to my labor and delivery room once again.  Making a conscious decision without pain or requests from my current midwife.  Sure, I’m 30 pounds heavier than I was seven years ago, I’ve accumulated more stretch marks than I could count, and my breasts look like they’ve seen better days.  Nevertheless, I am in love with the body I was given; I’m mesmerized by all the things it can do, and you should too.  As we witness our modern-day sex icons melt away their plastic surgery and Botox, it’s time for us to melt away our debilitating insecurities.  So, in the words of Taylor Swift, shake it off, and let’s redefine beauty together.  I want nothing more than to share my newfound courage and hope it continues to spread like wildfire."

Every 40 seconds, one of those babies dies. In the last decade, preterm birth rates have not changed in any region of the world. Coverage is highly inequitable and challenges disproportionately affect those most vulnerable. For example, nearly 1 in 10 preterm babies are born in the 10 most fragile countries affected by humanitarian crises where accessing care is particularly challenging.  A new report – Born Too Soon: Decade of Action on preterm birth – has highlighted that while encouraging progress has been made to prevent and protect preterm birth, much more concerted action is needed. Published at the International Maternal Newborn Health Conference (IMNHC) in Cape Town, South Africa, Born too soon sounds the alarm on the silent emergency of preterm birth, long under-recognised in its scale and severity, which is impeding progress in improving children’s health and survival.  The report has been produced by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) together with PMNCH – the world’s largest alliance for women, children and adolescents.  A pledge from leaders in women’s health and rights  As a member of the PMNCH Health-Care Professional Associations (HCPA) constituency, FIGO has come together with the Council of International Neonatal Nurses (COINN), International Confederation of Midwives (ICM), International Council of Nurses (ICN) and International Paediatric Association (IPA) have issued a joint statement to wholeheartedly commit to work together to take bold action to reduce the burden of preterm birth in the coming decade.  On the urgent need for collaborative action, Director of FIGO’s Division of Maternal and Newborn Health Professor Bo Jacobsson, said:  The inequities in coverage and quality of health services for women around the world are hindering progress towards the prevention of preterm births and stillbirths. Health care professionals have a key role to play as part of multi-stakeholder efforts to scale-up proven tools and resources aimed at the prevention of preterm birth, and to ensure women and families receive high quality, respectful and person-centred care.  FIGO and our partners re-affirm our commitment that all women and families receive respectful, person-centred care, and that women’s and adolescents’ voices are respected. Through the joint statement, we call upon our governments to support us in this critical work and invest in strengthening the health workforce so that skilled health care providers are comprehensively available to be able to ensure respectful high quality care reaches every mother and family  Partnership and people power  A decade on from the 2012 Born Too Soon report, more than 70 organisations have come together to develop an updated report. The report has been developed by more than 140 individuals from 46 countries, spanning national governments, civil society, including parents’ groups, health-care professional associations, young people, academic and research organisations, multilateral organisations, donors and foundations, and the private sector. Parents and families have shared their deeply personal experiences of preterm birth; a moving reminder that behind every statistic is a story of a family and a community deeply impacted, often for a lifetime.  The 2023 report is a testament to the power of partnership. Together, we are united in our call for a healthier and more equitable future for millions of babies, women and families.  Ensuring quality care for these tiniest, most vulnerable babies and their families is absolutely imperative for improving child health and survival. Progress is also needed to help prevent preterm births – this means every woman must be able to access quality health services before and during pregnancy to identify and manage risks. – Dr Anshu Banerjee, Director for Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health and Ageing, WHO  To make progress on maternal and newborn health, we must address preterm birth. Please share the report widely with your networks, partners, colleagues and friends. Together, we have all the ingredients for success.  More about the report  The report includes updated estimates from WHO and UNICEF, prepared with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, on the prevalence of preterm births. Overall, it finds that preterm birth rates have not changed in any region in the world in the past decade, with 152 million vulnerable babies born too soon from 2010 to 2020.  Image  Preterm birth is now the leading cause of child deaths, accounting for more than 1 in 5 of all deaths of children occurring before their 5th birthday. Preterm survivors can face lifelong health consequences, with an increased likelihood of disability and developmental delays.  The report notes that only 1 in 10 extremely preterm babies (<28 weeks) survive in low-income countries, compared to more than 9 in 10 in high-income countries. Gaping inequalities related to race, ethnicity, income, and access to quality care determine the likelihood of preterm birth, death, and disability, even in high-income countries.  Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa have the highest rates of preterm birth, and preterm babies in these regions face the highest mortality risk. Together, these two regions account for more than 65% of preterm births globally. The report also highlights that the impacts of conflict, climate change and environmental damage, COVID-19, and rising living costs are increasing risks for women and babies everywhere. For example, air pollution is estimated to contribute to 6 million preterm births each year. Nearly 1 in 10 preterm babies are born in the 10 most fragile countries affected by humanitarian crises, according to a new analysis in the report.  Maternal health risks, such as adolescent pregnancy and pre-eclampsia, are closely linked to preterm births. This underlines the need to ensure access to sexual and reproductive health services, including effective family planning, with high-quality care in pregnancy and around the time of birth."

Hello Abel Tesfaye.  The ""Can't Feel My Face"" singer may soon start going by his birth name, he told W magazine in a story published on May 8.  “I’m going through a cathartic path right now,” the 33-year-old singer said.  “It’s getting to a place and a time where I’m getting ready to close The Weeknd chapter,"" he explained. ""I’ll still make music, maybe as Abel, maybe as The Weeknd. But I still want to kill The Weeknd. And I will, eventually. I’m definitely trying to shed that skin and be reborn.”  Get Connecticut local news, weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox. Sign up for NBC Connecticut newsletters.  The Canadian singer said he came to the decision while working on his new show, ""The Idol,"" a drama series he co-created and stars in. The series, which co-stars Lily-Rose Depp as a pop star named Jocelyn, premieres on HBO on June 4.  While bringing his character Tedros to life for a scene filmed at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles last fall, the ""Die For You"" singer said he had trouble oscillating between himself and the role. Tedros is described in a synopsis as ""a self-help guru and leader of a modern day cult.""  “I had to take off The Weeknd outfit, put on Tedros’ wig, shoot with Jocelyn, then go back to being The Weeknd,” he recalled to W. “It was tough to go from one head to another.""  The singer said the peak of how jarring the experience was for him was when he lost his voice after filming the scene, which was shot during an actual Weeknd concert.  ""Then, after the concert, I lost my voice,"" he said. ""No voice came out at all. That’s never happened before.""  ""My theory is that I forgot how to sing because I was playing Tedros, a character who doesn’t know how to sing,"" he said. ""I may be looking too deeply into this, but it was terrifying.""  He said the experience prompted deep introspection. In September, The Weeknd cancelled the second show of a two-night run in Los Angeles after he lost his voice, NBC News reported at the time.  ""As The Weeknd, I’ve never skipped a concert,"" he said. ""I’ve performed with the flu. I’ll die on that stage. But there was something very complicated going on with my mind at that moment.”  This story first appeared on TODAY.com. More from TODAY:"

The sperm can live up to 5 days, therefore the pill is only effective 93-99% of the time. The pill is unnatural, and with pre-existing conditions, can cause cancer or other serious diagnoses.  What ever happened to teaching our children abstinence and responsibility, instead of the “feel good society” we live in today? God’s law commands, “Do Not Commit Adultery”. Period. Married couples can seek a “Natural Family Planning” program by consulting their church and a doctor. God’s reproductive rights, given to married men and women is a beautiful gift.  The birth control pill, in many cases, prevents the fertilized egg from attaching to it’s home, the uterus, and thus flushes it out of the mother’s body. It is just another form of murdering our babies.  It has been said the our country needs more people, therefore the immigrants should be welcomed into our country. If we would “not” have allowed “abortion” to murder 64 million of our babies (legal citizens) in the past 50 years, we would have 64 million more productive people in our USA today!  As we celebrate “Mother’s Day”, we acknowledge the disastrous leadership of Gov. Tim Walz, signing a bill to abort babies right up to their due date, and welcoming mothers from other states to come to Minnesota and do the same…is surely doing the work of the devil! So much for our “Minnesota Nice” policy.  With the sheer ignorance of President Biden, embodying more government control, by abolishing faith, family and freedom, our only defense is “prayer”.  The “woke” left is buddying up with Satan to dig the hole deeper every day:  • deflated our energy independence  • raising taxes  • higher living prices-inflation  • open borders  • increased crime with no prison time  • shutting down our churches  • killing our babies  • taking away rights to defend ourselves  • preventing parents’ knowledge of what’s being taught in school  • promoting gender change to our children and mutilating their bodies with no parental consent  • weakening foreign relations  • promoting a “new world order”, socialism  n light of these unfavorable conditions being imposed upon us, please pray earnestly, with love and joy in your hearts, for all Democrat and Republican leaders in our government to bring “peace” back into our world.

Governments in the region are spending hundreds of billions of dollars trying to reverse the trend. Will it work?  Japan began introducing policies to encourage couples to have more children in the 1990s. South Korea started doing the same in the 2000s, while Singapore's first fertility policy dates back to 1987.  China, which has seen its population fall for the first time on 60 years, recently joined the growing club.  While it is difficult to quantify exactly how much these policies have cost, South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol recently said his country had spent more than $200bn (£160bn) over the past 16 years on trying to boost the population.  Yet last year South Korea broke its own record for the world's lowest fertility rate, with the average number of babies expected per woman falling to 0.78.  In neighbouring Japan, which had record low births of fewer than 800,000 last year, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has pledged to double the budget for child-related policies from 10tn yen ($74.7bn; £59.2bn), which is just over 2% of the country's gross domestic product.  Globally, while there are more countries that are trying to lower birth rates, the number of countries wanting to increase fertility has more than tripled since 1976, according to the most recent report by the United Nations.  China ditched its one-child policy in 2016  So why do these governments want to grow their populations?  Simply put, having a bigger population who can work and produce more goods and services leads to higher economic growth. And while a larger population can mean higher costs for governments, it can also result in bigger tax revenues.  Also, many Asian countries are ageing rapidly. Japan leads the pack with nearly 30% of its population now over the age of 65 and some other nations in the region are not far behind.  Compare that with India, which has just overtaken China as the world's most populous nation. More than a quarter of its people are between the age of 10 and 20, which gives its economy huge potential for growth.  Story continues  And when the share of the working age population gets smaller, the cost and burden of looking after the non-working population grow.  ""Negative population growth has an impact on the economy, and combined that with an ageing population, they won't be able to afford to support the elderly,"" said Xiujian Peng of Victoria University.  Graphic showing China's birthrate per 1,000 people, from 1978 to 2022. There has been a steady decline in recent years. The figure in 1978 was 18.25, while it was 6.77 in 2022.  Most of the measures across the region to increase birth rates have been similar: payments for new parents, subsidised or free education, extra nurseries, tax incentives and expanded parental leave.  But do these measures work?  Data for last few decades from Japan, South Korea and Singapore shows that attempts to boost their populations have had very little impact. Japan's finance ministry has published a study which said the policies were a failure.  It is a view echoed by the United Nations.  ""We know from history that the types of policies which we call demographic engineering where they try to incentivise women to have more babies, they just don't work,"" Alanna Armitage of United Nations Population Fund told the BBC.  ""We need to understand the underlying determinants of why women are not having children, and that is often the inability of women to be able to combine their work life with their family life,"" she added.  But in Scandinavian countries, fertility policies have worked better than they did in Asia, according to Ms Peng.  ""The main reason is because they have a good welfare system and the cost of raising children is cheaper. Their gender equality is also much more balanced than in Asian countries.""  Asian countries have ranked lower in comparison in the global gender gap report by the World Economic Forum.  Japan has the highest debt in the G7  There are also major questions over how these expensive measures should be funded, especially in Japan, which is the world's most indebted developed economy.  Options under consideration in Japan include selling more government bonds, which means increasing its debt, raising its sales tax or increasing social insurance premiums.  The first option adds financial burden to the future generations, while the other two would hit already struggling workers, which could convince them to have fewer children.  But Antonio Fatás, professor of economics at INSEAD says regardless of whether these policies work, they have to invest in them.  ""Fertility rates have not increased but what if there was less support? Maybe they would be even lower,"" he said.  Governments are also investing in other areas to prepare their economies for shrinking populations.  ""China has been investing in technologies and innovations to make up for the declining labour force in order to mitigate the negative impact of the shrinking population,"" said Ms Peng.  Also, while it remains unpopular in countries like Japan and South Korea, lawmakers are discussing changing their immigration rules to try to entice younger workers from overseas.  ""Globally, the fertility rate is falling so it'll be a race to attract young people to come and work in your country,"" Ms Peng added.  Whether the money is well spent on fertility policies, these governments appear to have no other choice."

The critically endangered pups were born on April 28, 2023, and are the offspring of four-year-old Gloria and three-year-old Oak, both first-time parents.  The nine pups – eight females and one male – are all healthy and doing well. The Nature Center’s veterinary care team carefully monitors the newborns during these critical first weeks. At just two weeks old, these pups are still wholly dependent on their parents, but Gloria and Oak have been seen moving them around the habitat, so guests may sporadically see them. The pups may begin venturing out of the den box around the end of May, and guests may begin to see the pups in the red wolf habitat in June. The WNC Nature Center’s social media channels will share updates on the progress of the pups.  Background:  Parents Gloria and Oak were paired in January 2023 based on a breeding recommendation from the Red Wolf SAFE (Saving Animals From Extinction) program of the Association of Zoos & Aquariums. SAFE is a collaborative effort between zoos and other conservation organizations to protect and recover the red wolf population through habitat restoration, genetically diverse breeding, and reintroducing red wolves into their natural habitat. Gloria was born in April 2019 at the Endangered Wolf Center in Missouri and Oak was born at the NC Zoo in Asheboro in April 2020.  By participating in this program, the WNC Nature Center is making a significant contribution to the conservation of this critically endangered species. “The WNC Nature Center is honored to be a part of the American red wolf conservation effort,” said WNC Nature Center Director Chris Gentile, “and we are so proud of Gloria and Oak for playing such an essential role in helping their species recover.”  American red wolves are native to North America and are one of the most endangered canine species in the world. In April 2023, the US Fish & Wildlife Service estimated that there are only 15 to 17 red wolves living in the wild in Eastern North Carolina. Red wolves in the SAFE program under human care numbered 235. The WNC Nature Center has been part of the American Red Wolf Recovery Program since 1990. Between 1996 and 2014, 13 pups were born at the Nature Center. This year’s litter brings that total to 22.  Community support:  Community members and supporters of red wolf conservation also have a role to play. With a pack of 11 red wolves at the WNC Nature Center, the community can help support a local effort to save these critically endangered animals. Donations can be made online at www.wildwnc.org/donate or mailed to Friends of the WNC Nature Center, PO Box 19151, Asheville, NC, 28815.  The WNC Nature Center connects people of all ages with the plants and animals of the Southern Appalachian Mountains. Asheville’s wildlife park is located on 42 acres at 75 Gashes Creek Road and is home to more than 60 species of animals, including red pandas, river otters, black bears, and red and gray wolves.

Doyle’s wife, Lakelyn, was pregnant when her husband disappeared and gave birth to their daughter last month, the Sun News reported.  Social media posts from before Tyler’s disappearance hinted that the couple planned to name the baby Paisley Grace.  Meanwhile, shortly after her husband went missing, Lakelyn asked a friend to shut down the family’s GoFundMe “due to the rumors and everything going around.”  “She [would] rather go without, then to deal with drama and rumors while she’s actively searching for her missing husband … as a [woman who is] 30 weeks pregnant she can’t handle everyone’s opinion and stress on her body for the baby’s sake,” family friend Hannah Faulk wrote in early February.  Although it is unclear exactly what gossip prompted the request for donations to stop, Tyler’s brother, Reed, also posted on Facebook, slamming “everyone who’s out there spreading rumors about my brother.”  There has been no sign of Tyler since his duck decoys, waders and wallet were found about two miles offshore on Jan. 31, the Sun News said.

Grady gave birth to five daughters. The first two were born in a hospital, but then she had a change of heart.  “There had been no trauma at the hospital births, and I have no idea where this thought originated, but I wanted to have the next baby at my friend’s home,” said Grady and laughed. “I had to look up 'Midwives' in the Yellow Pages. The experience of home birth blew me away. It was transformative and stirred a passion in me.”  Download the Napa Valley Register's free news app Easily access the very latest local news that matters in an app built for you. Read, see, and hear exclusive commentary, stunning photography,…  All California midwives must be licensed with the California Medical Board to practice. Grady got her education at the National Midwifery Institute and is a Licensed Midwife (LM) with a national certification as a Certified Professional Midwife (CPM).  Grady runs the facility alongside the center’s executive director, husband Darren Grady. Also on the team is colleague Deborah (Fawn) Studebaker, LM, CPM. The center partners with midwife assistants and students, a lactation consultant, pregnancy and childbirth educators and consultant OB/GYN doctors.  The Napa center is located at 525 Lincoln Ave. and the Santa Rosa center (formerly Thrive Center for Birth and Family Wellness) is at 4859 Old Redwood Highway (themidwives.com). Should the need arise, they also work with nearby hospitals.  Natural childbirth is a vaginal birth involving no medical interventions such as forceps, vacuums, or epidurals. Medically trained professionals such as licensed midwives and doulas are available to assist with natural childbirth, whether the birth itself takes place in a hospital, stand-alone birthing center, or at home.  The American Association of Birth Centers describes birth centers as “a safe, alternative, choice 'in-between' home and hospital; a facility designed to support natural labor and delivery, supported by highly trained midwives and skilled staff, offering a family-centered, relaxed, calm, non-institutional experience.”  The Napa Valley and Sonoma Valley Birth Centers offer pre-natal care and childbirth attendance, along with emergency equipment and supplies if needed, and postpartum visits. The birth centers can also assist with home births, water births and doulas.  “There is a difference between midwives and doulas,” said Paula Grady. “A doula provides emotional and physical care, and postpartum support for the mother. As licensed midwives, we can provide medical care, order lab work such as ultrasound, and make medical decisions. Doulas don't provide medical care.”  Grady said that during natural birth, 99% of the mothers opt for using a birth tub, at least for part of the process. “I’d say that 75- 80% experience water births.” The birth centers have tubs available.  According to the Peterson-Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) Health System Tracker, hospital childbirth costs an average of $18,865 nationwide, which includes pregnancy, delivery and postpartum care. The International Federation of Health Plans says our state is higher, “California is particularly expensive… with hospitals there charging an average of $26,380 for mothers to give birth to their child.”  The cost for the Midwives Childbirth Services is $7,500, with discount options and payment plans. Most insurance PPO plans cover at least part of birth center childbirths, HMOs may not.  The midwives said that the best candidates for a natural birth are “normal, healthy moms with normal, healthy babies.”  “Mothers feel safe and comfortable with us,” said Paula Grady. “They know the birth team will take good care of them. It’s an emotional, mental event and a big transformation.”  Studebaker added that natural childbirth is an excellent option for first-time mothers. “I’d say it’s better for first-time moms; in fact, it’s vital.”  Prior to the opening of the Sonoma Valley Birth Center, Rhiannon Sanders of Guerneville had her first child in February. She chose Paula and the Napa Valley Birth Center for the delivery.  “Early in my pregnancy, I didn’t know what the experience would be like,” said Sanders. “I went to an OB/GYN thinking they’d give me an education; information about what I should be eating and so on. I got none of that. As soon as I met Paula, though, she gave me a large booklet on what I could expect week by week. By then, I was far along at 35 weeks.”  “Originally, I thought I’d give birth at home, but when I saw the Napa Valley Birth Center, it looked as pleasant and comfortable as my own home. Since I live over an hour and a half away, I was concerned about the drive while in labor. Paula said I could come during early labor and just hang out. That reassured me. I think for first-time moms, the birth center is a happy medium between a hospital and home birth. It’s great to have all the resources right there.”  Darren Grady summed up what was important for people who want to have a natural birth. “With the recent closing of several hospital Labor and Delivery departments, North Bay mamas do have alternatives to a hospital birth,” he said in an email. “A stand-alone birth center is becoming even more viable as a safe, supportive setting for pregnancy and childbirth. Paula and the midwives can provide midwifery care and a natural birth experience at the Napa Valley Birth Center in Napa or the Sonoma Valley Birth Center in Santa Rosa.”  Photos: Take a look inside the Napa Valley Birth Center"

OKAY. WE’RE TALKING ABOUT JUST WEST OF I-35. THIS IS GOING TO BE ESPECIALLY JUST RIGHT AROUND THE WARREN THEATER, THE MOORE MEDICAL CENTER, ROYAL PARK, MOORE. THIS IS ALL ON THE WEST SIDE OF I-35. YOU ARE IN THE PATH OF THIS TORNADO. SO I THINK THE MORE MEDICAL CENTER LOOKING DIRECTLY INTO THIS AND WHILE THAT DAY IN 2013 WAS FILLED WITH SO MUCH TRAGEDY AND DESTRUCTION FOR AT LEAST ONE FAMILY, A MIRACLE TOOK PLACE. AMONG THAT CHAOS, KOCO ZACH RAEL SPOKE WITH SHAYLA TAYLOR. SHE WAS IN LABOR AS THE TORNADO BARRELED DOWN ON MOORE MEDICAL CENTER. HE HAS AN UPDATE TODAY ON HER SON AND HOW THAT FATEFUL DAY HAS COME FULL CIRCLE A DECADE LATER. LOOKING BACK TEN YEARS LATER, SHAYLA TAYLOR SAYS STORMS, ESPECIALLY TORNADOES, WERE THE LAST THING ON HER MIND AS SHE STARTED HER DAY ON MAY 20TH, 2013. THAT’S BECAUSE TAYLOR WAS SCHEDULED TO BE INDUCED TO GIVE BIRTH TO HER SECOND SON. THAT AFTERNOON. SEVERE WEATHER, TORNADOES, NOTHING LIKE THAT WAS ON MY MIND AT ALL, WAS GO IN, HAVE A BABY, GO HOME. AND THAT’S THE END OF IT. AS IT TURNED OUT, HER DELIVERY WAS ANYTHING BUT THAT SIMPLE. AS SHE GOT TO MOORE MEDICAL CENTER, HER DOCTORS AND NURSES KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ON THE WEATHER FORECASTS. AS IT WAS PREDICTED, STRONG STORMS COULD BE FORMING THAT AFTERNOON WHEN I GOT THERE, THE DOCTOR TOLD ME THAT SHE WAS GOING TO CHECK THE WEATHER AND SEE IF I WAS ACTUALLY IN ACTIVE LABOR OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE THERE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE BAD WEATHER THAT DAY. WHATEVER THE WEATHER, THE BABY WAS WELL ON ITS WAY. AND TAYLOR WAS GIVEN AN EPIDURAL, WHICH MEANS THAT SHE CAN NO LONGER MOVE HERSELF FREELY. SHORTLY AFTER, THAT’S WHEN THINGS OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL TOOK A TURN FOR THE WORST. A TORNADO EMERGENCY WAS ISSUED AROUND MAYBE TWO OR SO. THEY COME IN AND SAY THAT WE’RE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE COVER AND MY FAMILY IS GOING TO HAVE TO GO DOWNSTAIRS TO THE CAFETERIA. I CAN’T GO ANYWHERE BECAUSE, LIKE I SAID, I CAN’T GET OUT OF BED. A RARE F5 TORNADO WAS HEADING RIGHT TOWARDS MOORE MEDICAL CENTER. DOCTORS AND NURSES RUSHING TO GET TAYLOR TO A SAFE SPOT. THEY DECIDE THEY’RE GOING TO HAVE TO MOVE ME TO THE PLACE WHERE THERE’S NO WINDOWS AS CLOSE AWAY FROM THE OUTSIDE OF THE BUILDING AS THEY CAN, WHICH ENDED UP BEING THE OR JUST MINUTES LATER, THAT MASSIVE TORNADO HIT THE HOSPITAL HEAD ON, DESTROYING THE BUILDING AROUND HER. A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THAT, YOU HEAR LIKE A SILENCE OR LIKE A TRAIN OR WHATEVER WHEN TORNADOES COME THROUGH. BUT IT WAS MORE OF A SILENT THING, LIKE YOU DIDN’T REALLY HEAR ANYTHING. YOU JUST SAW EVERYTHING KIND OF FALLING AROUND YOU. THIS IS A PHOTO OF WHAT WAS LEFT OF THE O.R. WHERE TAYLOR WAS HUNKERED DOWN. YOU CAN SEE THE DEBRIS AND DESTRUCTION ALL AROUND WHEN IT WAS ACTUALLY HITTING WAS WHEN I WAS THE MOST SCARED. TAYLOR AND HER FAMILY SURVIVED. BUT EVEN WITH THE DESTRUCTION AROUND THEM, THAT DIDN’T CHANGE THE FACT THAT SHE WAS GOING TO GIVE BIRTH VERY SOON. SHE NEEDED TO GET TO SAFETY. THAT WAS A TASK IN ITSELF BECAUSE I’M UPSTAIRS AND I SAID ALL THE HALLWAYS ARE DARK. EVEN WHEN THEY CARRIED ME DOWN ON THE BACKBOARD, IT WAS DARK GOING DOWN THE STAIRS. YOU KNOW, YOU’RE JUST KIND OF LOOKING AROUND. YOU CAN’T REALLY SEE MUCH OF ANYTHING. SO THE FIRST LIGHT I ACTUALLY SAW WAS ONCE WE GOT OUTSIDE OF THE HOSPITAL, ONCE SHE WAS OUTSIDE, TAYLOR SAYS, SHE STARTED TO REALIZE THE TRUE MAGNITUDE OF THE STORM. IT WAS MUDDY. THERE WAS THERE WERE TREES AND DEBRIS EVERYWHERE. THERE WERE CARS AND STUFF KIND OF EVERYWHERE. SO I KNEW THAT IT WAS PRETTY BAD.

I hate to use “Lynchian,” a term frequently — and slovenly — invoked for films with a merely surrealist bent. But Schaefer’s film, also steeped in a distinctly American nostalgia, more than deserves the description.  In this uncanny indie, we’re plunged into an American no-place, where a suburban father, Daryl (Paul Sparks), plans to open a diner despite not having any money; and where a former actress named Monica (Constance Shulman, channeling Norma Desmond in “Sunset Boulevard”) prepares for a big interview that will never happen. Opposite these tragic figures is Daryl’s wife, Diane (Annie Parisse), and Monica’s daughter Marlene (Gus Birney) — two women worn down by the follies of their loved ones."

Then she asks if any of the students has ever seen a woman give birth. Most have not.  Curious about how cultural attitudes and expectations affect the physical experience of childbirth and its outcomes, Dr. Thayer began a study to assess the prevalence of tokophobia, the medical term for a pathological fear of childbirth.  Though tokophobia has been well studied in Scandinavian countries, some of which screen pregnant women and offer treatment for it, little research has been done in the United States. Dr. Thayer’s online survey of nearly 1,800 American women found that in the early days of the pandemic, tokophobia may have affected the majority of American women: 62 percent of pregnant respondents reported high levels of fear and worry about childbirth.  The results were published last month in the journal Evolution, Medicine, and Public Health.  Other scientists who study childbirth said the levels of fear in the United States were higher than those reported in Europe and Australia, which are lower than 20 percent. But they noted that birthing conditions in the United States are different and that pandemic circumstances may have exacerbated fears."

In addition to these findings, the reports recorded a net-gain in population to rural parts of the commonwealth through in-migration.  The reports, released by the Center for Rural Pennsylvania, a state legislative agency for rural policy, use data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Health, to better understand the commonwealth’s rural areas, including who is moving into — and out of — them.  In-Migration/Out-Migration  Data from the U.S. Census Bureau shows that in 2021, more than 144,900 people moved into rural Pennsylvania and approximately 123,300 moved out. This movement resulted in a net gain of approximately 21,600 new residents, down from 21,800 in 2019.  The report found that the majority of people (52%) moving to rural Pennsylvania, were from out-of-state.  In fact, more than 54% of the people moving to rural Pennsylvania came from neighboring states New York, New Jersey and Maryland.  Another 41% of the people who moved to rural areas of the commonwealth came from its urban areas, compared to 2019 when 38% came from urban Pennsylvania.  Lastly, 7% of the people who moved to rural Pennsylvania came from outside of the United States.  Of those who left rural Pennsylvania, 53% went to other states, compared to 61% in 2019.  Fifty-one percent of those moved to one of the following five states: Florida, New York, Maryland, North Carolina and South Carolina.  Additionally, 47% of those who moved out of rural Pennsylvania relocated to urban areas in 2021.  The report identified working adults and college students as the two largest demographic groups driving in-migration to rural areas of the commonwealth.  Working adults between the ages of 18 and 64 made up 40% of the people who moved out of rural Pennsylvania and 37% of those who moved into rural areas.  College students made up 22% of those who moved into rural Pennsylvania and 18% of those who moved out, according to the report.  Birth & Death Rates  From 2010 to 2020, deaths outnumbered births in rural Pennsylvania, accounting for the loss of nearly 85,000 residents.  Nationally, the birth rate from 2010 to 2020 was 12.13 per 1,000 residents, according to census data.  At 10.87 births per 1,000 residents, Pennsylvania had one of the nation’s lowest birth rates over the same time period with only eight states having lower birth rates.  In rural Pennsylvania, the birth rate was lower than the statewide rate at 9.17 births per 1,000 residents.  The report found that Wayne, Centre, Sullivan, Pike and Forest counties had the lowest birth rates with each having rates below 8 births per 1,000 residents.  ——  Pennsylvania Capital-Star is part of States Newsroom, a network of news bureaus supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

Law enforcement noticed the children appeared nervous and ultimately discovered the birth certificates were for other people.  Aguilar admitted the minors were not relatives, but undocumented aliens, and expected to be paid $4,700 to smuggle the minors into the United States.

This is according to a study presented at the International Maternal Newborn Health Conference held in Cape Town last week. The research was also published in The New England Journal of Medicine.  The piece of plastic, which researchers call a “drape”, is slid in underneath the patient and tied around her waist after she’s given birth. It collects blood in a pouch that hangs off the bottom end of the hospital bed — and it costs less than R30.

But the pair was surprised when they discovered at the 12th week scan that they would be having triplets.  Harper-Gwen, Marvella and and Evalynn are all identical and they were delivered nine weeks prematurely on March 31.

The three children spent more than a month at the Special Care Baby Unit at York Hospital before being allowed to be taken home.    Identical triplets are very rare because they are conceived only when a single fertilised egg splits into three.  Although scientists have not managed to fully calculate the chances of a mother having identical triplets, it said to occur every one in a million birth.

However, the implications of this advice are yet to be fully understood, as current research presents a somewhat murky picture of marijuana’s impact on prenatal development.  In an attempt to shed light on this issue, a team of researchers embarked on a study to explore how the timing of cannabis exposure during pregnancy affects fetal development.  According to the findings, even marijuana use restricted to the first trimester of pregnancy resulted in a noteworthy decrease in birth weight – over 150 grams on average.

To get to the first European settlers, we have to go back a few more decades when a scout names Rafael Rivera discovered what would come to be known as Las Vegas: the meadows of the desert.  In 1830, it was an oasis along the Old Spanish Trail, and Rivera completed the section of that trail where the Las Vegas metropolitan area now sprawls.  Rivera hiked the Vegas Wash and became the first person after the Native Americans to visit the Las Vegas Valley.  Even back then, Las Vegas had a reputation.

Overall, exposure rises in adolescence — 14 is the mean age of seeing somebody shot and 17 is the mean age for being shot.  “The oldest cohorts were quite disadvantaged,” Sampson noted, “because they came of age during the peak of violence in the United States and Chicago.” U.S. homicide rates topped out in the early 1990s, just as those born in the early ’80s reached their teens. Around half of respondents born in 1981 and 1984 reported witnessing gun violence, while those who had been shot hovered around 7 percent.  As crime rates declined, subsequent birth cohorts faced less exposure to firearms. Those born in 1996 reported the lowest levels of seeing somebody shot — their exposure was half that of the two oldest cohorts — but direct victimization was another story. “Surprisingly,” Sampson added, “unlike witnessing violence, there was no statistical difference"

Kunal Sen believed his father would have adapted to the technological advancements to make low-budget films.    From ‘Mrigayaa’, ‘Calcutta 71’, ‘Kharij’, ‘Ek Din Pratidin’, to ‘Bhuvan Shome’, Sen, who gave birth to a new cinema movement in India, highlighted the middle-class lives in the city through most of his films.  However, as Anjan Dutt rightly pointed out, Sen’s films threw questions at the audience, actors and even himself. However, he never sought solutions.  Kolkata is celebrating the birth centenary of the master filmmaker. On Monday, an eight-day birth centenary celebration, titled ‘Sentenary’ kicked off at Gorky Sadan. Beginning Monday, (May 15), the celebrations which comprise exhibitions, talk shows and film screenings, will continue till May 22.  Madhabi Mukherjee, who stole our hearts forever with her performance in ‘Baishe Srabon’, Bangladesh filmmaker Tanvir Mokammel, Goutam Ghose, Mamata Shankar, Ashoke Viswanathan and Kunal were present at the inauguration at Gorky Sadan.  An exhibition of his photographs, posters, journals, books on and by Sen, letters and mementoes is on at Gorky Sadan for all film buffs from 3.30 pm to 5.30 pm, except May 17 and May 21.  The inauguration ceremony was followed by the screening of the documentary titled ‘With Mrinal Sen’ directed by Sanjay and Subrata Bhattacharya. For the next five days, his cult films like ‘Baishe Srabon’, ‘Matira Manisha’, ‘Oka Oori Katha’ and ‘Genesis’ would be screened along with adda sessions on the maestro.  “My father always made low-budget films. Today, technology has made huge advancements and I am sure, Bondhu (as he would call his father) would have adapted to this changing technology and made films within a restricted budget,” said Kunal, who has written a book, ‘Bondhu — My Father, My Friend?’ on the master filmmaker."

On Monday, the Canadian artist's Twitter and Instagram accounts had updated to display his birth name rather than his artistic name.  And the change is part of a wider plan to ""kill The Weeknd,"" Tesfaye told W Magazine in an interview published May 8.  ""I'm going through a cathartic path right now,"" he said.  🏜️ ? — Abel Tesfaye (@theweeknd) April 11, 2023  ""It's getting to a place and a time where I'm getting ready to close the Weeknd chapter. I'll still make music, maybe as Abel, maybe as The Weeknd. But I still want to kill The Weeknd. And I will. Eventually. I'm definitely trying to shed that skin and be reborn.""  And Tesfaye revealed that his upcoming album might well be The Weeknd's swansong.  ""The album I'm working on now is probably my last hurrah as The Weeknd,"" he told W Magazine.  ""This is something that I have to do. As The Weeknd, I've said everything I can say.""  In March, Guinness World Records (GWR) announced that the singer-songwriter is statistically the most popular musician on the planet.  The 33-year-old took two new Guinness World Record titles. He had the most monthly listeners on Spotify, with 111.4 million as of March 20, and also became the first artist to reach 100 million monthly listeners.  A surge in listens was fueled in part by the fact that a remix of ""Die for You,"" featuring Ariana Grande, went viral on TikTok, according to GWR.  The track went to number one on the Billboard Hot 100 -- The Weeknd's seventh time at the top spot. The original ""Die for You"" was released in 2016 on his album ""Starboy."""

Ashlee Wilson, 34, from Banksia Grove, in Perth's north-east, was home alone last week when she rang triple zero complaining of severe stomach pains.  Little did she know, she was pregnant with her daughter Marley-Rae, who was born just six minutes after paramedics arrived.  'I said to (the paramedic), ''No I'm not (pregnant)'', and she said, ''Yes you are'',' Ms Wilson told Sunrise.  Ms Wilson could be heard wailing in agony in audio of the phone call she made to emergency services.  'The pain is coming right now, ugh!' she was heard crying out.  'Oh my God! I'm just sitting on the toilet because it feels like something's trying to come out but there's nothing there and it hurts!'  There was no time to rush to the hospital once paramedics arrived and Ms Wilson ended up giving birth to little Marley-Rae in her living room.  'I was in complete denial, I did not want to believe (the paramedic) at all,' she said.  'I was scared about what was happening to my body at the time and I was just in big denial.'  The 34-year-old had gone to her doctor complaining of a bloating issue but was bizarrely told just to drink more water and eat peanuts.  'Visually it was really hard to see, a lot of my family have been going through photos and saying ''even there you don't look pregnant'',' she said.  Ms Wilson admitted that because she had no idea she was pregnant, she was 'kind of in party mode'.  Ashlee Wilson, 34, from Banksia Grove, in Perth's north-east, was home alone last week when she rang triple zero complaining of severe stomach pains  'Of course there were things I was doing that I shouldn't have been doing that now I look back and think, ''Oh my God I'm so sorry if anything happens to you because of that'',' she added.  Both Ms Wilson and Marley-Rae are doing well one week on, with the mother saying the birth of her little girl is one of the best things that has ever happened to her.  'Here I was thinking I wanted to be an interstate truck driver a week-and-a-half-ago, now I want to give her the world and take it over with her,' she said.  St John Ambulance paramedic Melissa Gardiner said she felt lucky she was called out to the house.  'I feel like I was literally made for meeting Ashlee and Marley-Rae helping her into the world,' she said.  'Everything that I've done in my career has pretty much I think led me to Saturday morning.'"
