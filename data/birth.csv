Uniquely, the project will produce clean geothermal power for its own use and for sale into the market, in addition to lithium hydroxide. The hydroxide will start life as a lithium chloride concentrate, courtesy of a “Lithium Extraction Optimisation Plant” (LEOP) that will make use of direct lithium extraction (DLE) technology in preference to the huge and environmentally-tricky “ponds” that are often used in South America and elsewhere to essentially evaporate the water, leaving the lithium behind.  The final processing stage of the LEOP is a piece of plant known as a “Crystallizer” and in a move that shows Vulcan is serious about moving the ball forward, the company says the crystallizer went in this week.  After the release of a definitive feasibility study earlier this year that contained an eye-watering set of numbers, execution mode has gone into full swing at Vulcan. The company says that once operational and producing lithium chloride, the LEOP will usher in a game-changing new lithium era in Europe.  The LEOP will be fed with hot geothermal brines that will be harvested for their energy-producing potential before the lithium is directly extracted from them using the “sorption” method that has been successfully used in China.  The lithium chloride concentrate will then be trucked to another plant where it will be turned into the lucrative lithium hydroxide that the world is crying out for right now. And Vulcan has no shortage of big players that have already put their hand up for the hydroxide offtake, including Volkswagon, Stellantis, Renault, Umicore and LG Energy.  The German brine field, Vulcan’s birthplace, is Europe’s biggest lithium resource – and a globally-significant one, with the potential to supply product into the domestic battery electric vehicle markets. The brine field within Vulcan’s carbon-neutral project covers 1583 square kilometres and contains 26.6 million tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent in 10 of its 15 licenses. It is also located strategically in the middle of the European battery industry that is now starting to hit its straps.  Vulcan has its geothermal plant back up and running after a planned pause and has also acquired its first land package for its phase-one commercial lithium and renewable energy development, with further acquisitions expected in the coming weeks. It says the acquired land also proves it has a positive connection with the local community.  Management says drilling works and LEOP plant operation remain on track for this year’s third quarter.  Notably, Vulcan’s sorption-type DLE method is the same as that to be used by the merged Allkem and Livent operation following their show-stopping US$10.6 billion (AU$15.8 million) deal which created global headlines last week.  Chilean officials, as part of a mandate to cut the country’s water waste, recently revealed they would be backing new brine projects to use the direct extraction method and investment bank Goldman Sachs released a report last month clearly outlining that it preferred “briners to miners”.  Vulcan has also engaged international law firm White and Case as its borrower’s legal advisor to work alongside BNP Paribas in its debt-financing process. It says has already had positive feedback from multiple commercial and development banks after dragging its briefcase around to see some of the industry’s bigger financial players.  Letters of intent have been secured from the French, Italian and Canadian government Export Credit Agencies, which the company says is in line with similar approaches taken by successful project developers in the past. French Agency, bpiFrance, has classed Vulcan’s project as being of strategic importance and management intends to have its entire debt and equity project funding in place by the first quarter of next year.  Vulcan is leveraging its existing cash to advance engineering and order commercial long-lead items, while financing for the full-project capital expenditure is ongoing. The company last week revealed it had raised $109 million from institutional investors in Australia, Europe, the United States and Hong Kong. It has $270 million in cash and no debt and is rapidly advancing the execution of its phase-one commercial project.  The sheer scale, strategic simplicity and logic of Vulcan’s plan is clear and if it all comes together, it will no doubt spark a run on other geothermal brines that might contain lithium.  The company’s DFS shows margins that would make a hard-rock miner blush, largely due to the fact that it will uniquely produce (and even sell) its own geothermal energy – a major cost factor at any operation.  The project is as big as it is bold and is currently hailed as the largest lithium deposit in Europe. If lithium is to be the new oil, as it is sometimes described, this is one company that has plenty.  Is your ASX-listed company doing something interesting? Contact: matt.birney@wanews.com.au"

The 14-person panel unanimously recommended the shot, made by Pfizer, based on its efficacy and voted 10-4 to recommend it based on its safety.  If the shot is eventually approved by the FDA, it would be the first vaccine that confers protection against respiratory syncytial virus to babies.  “Before the pandemic, RSV was the No. 1 cause of infant hospitalization in the United States, so this is a big deal,” said Dr. Ofer Levy, the director of the Precision Vaccines Program at Boston Children’s Hospital. Levy is a temporary voting member of the FDA panel but wasn’t involved in Thursday’s vote.  In healthy adults, lower respiratory illness caused by RSV is typically mild, but it can be more severe in babies and older adults. The virus kills up to 300 children under 5 every year in the U.S. and up to 10,000 people ages 65 or older, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Severe infections can result in pneumonia or bronchiolitis, which inflames airways and clogs them with mucus.  It could take months for the FDA to decide whether to approve the shot, but the agency is likely to follow the advisory committee’s recommendation.  The FDA approved the world’s first RSV vaccine this month, made by pharmaceutical giant GSK, but the shot is only for adults ages 60 and up.  Pfizer also has an RSV shot for older adults up for FDA approval this month. The FDA advisory panel in late February recommended the shot for people ages 60 and up. It’s the same vaccine that would be given to pregnant people.  To protect infants, the shot would be given to pregnant people at 24 to 36 weeks’ gestation; the protective antibodies transfer through the placenta.  The committee members generally praised the vaccine’s efficacy but shared reservations about the duration of protection and a potential risk of preterm birth.  In a clinical trial with nearly 7,400 participants, the vaccine lowered the risk of severe disease from RSV among infants by 82% within roughly three months after birth. By around six months, efficacy was around 69%. Infants 6 months and younger are especially vulnerable to severe cases of RSV.  The shot also lowered the risk of developing respiratory disease from RSV that required doctors’ visits by 51% within about six months. After that, however, the vaccine didn’t appear to make a big difference.  In a briefing document, the FDA said safety data from the trial seemed “generally favorable.” The most common side effects of the shot reported among pregnant women were fatigue, headache, muscle pain and injection site pain.  However, the agency noted that there was a slightly higher rate of preterm births — defined as before 37 weeks’ gestation — among people who received the vaccine (5.7%) versus those who got a placebo (4.7%). The difference wasn’t statistically significant, however, so it’s unclear whether it was vaccine-related.  Both rates were lower than the rate of preterm births in the general population: around 10%, according to the CDC.  Last year, the pharmaceutical giant GSK halted its trial of an RSV vaccine for infants after it showed a higher preterm birth rate among some vaccine recipients.  Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the FDA advisory committee and director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said the outcome of GSK’s trial was relevant to Pfizer’s study, since the two vaccines are similar.  “I worry that if preterm births are in any way a consequence of this vaccine, that would be tragic in many ways,” Offit said at Thursday’s meeting. He voted against the shot based on its safety.  Pfizer said that if its shot is approved, it would continue to monitor the risk of preterm birth among vaccine recipients.  Levy said researchers generally pay close attention to any potential risk of preterm birth among vaccines given to pregnant people.  “There’s always the background concern: Are you inducing some inflammation that could be a problem? Because the body reads inflammation as ‘the woman’s no longer safe, let’s get the baby out.’ So you want a fairly bland vaccine,” he said.  But Adam Berger, a researcher at the National Institutes of Health who voted in favor of the shot based on both safety and efficacy, said the vaccine is strongly needed.  “There isn’t another option here for prevention and it really could save a lot of lives,” Berger said.  Eleven RSV vaccines (including GSK’s approved shot) are being actively studied in U.S. trials, according to data provided to NBC News by PATH, a nonprofit global health organization. Six are for older adults, and five are designed to protect infants or children.  A monoclonal antibody injection, which is given directly to infants and functions similarly to a vaccine, has already been approved in Canada, Europe and the United Kingdom. The FDA began reviewing data on that shot in January and is expected to decide this summer or fall whether to approve it."

By Lisa Fishbayn Joffe  Reading the Torah, there is no doubt about motherhood's important role in Jewish literature and life.  The Hebrew Bible is replete with stories of women who feel incomplete without children, although Orthodox interpretation holds that only men are commanded to ""be fruitful and multiply."" Unable to bear children, Sarah offers her handmaid Hagar to her husband, Abraham, so he can father a child.  Rachel longs for deliverance from infertility, saying, ""Give me children or I shall die,"" and Hannah provides a model for Jewish personal prayer when she fervently prays for a child on the steps of the Temple in Jerusalem.    Women are not, however, expected to place motherhood ahead of their own well-being. (See ""Do Abortion Bans Violate Jews' Religious Rights?"") For example, Jewish law not only permits but requires that a pregnancy be terminated when it jeopardizes the life of the mother.    Of course, many stories in Jewish sacred texts celebrate women for reasons that have nothing to do with parenting – from Queen Esther's bravery in the Book of Esther to the powerful judge Deborah in the Book of Judges and wise women like Beruriah, who is quoted in the Talmud.  Yet the value placed on motherhood is clear – not only in Jewish texts but also in Jewish traditions.  For centuries, ritual practices have celebrated the birth of children. Yet they have not always given new mothers an opportunity to celebrate on their own terms or share their own feelings.  As a scholar of Judaism and gender, though, I have seen how this is changing, as Jewish women reinvent meaningful traditions or develop new ones.  Medieval Mothers  Behind the Mehitza  According to historian Elisheva Baumgarten , medieval Jewish women in northern and eastern Europe observed a monthlong period of lying-in after the birth, where they were cared for at home by friends.Upon its conclusion, the new mother would then go to synagogue on the Sabbath to say prayers of thanks and have special tunes sung in her honor. If she had borne a boy, she might craft an embroidered wimpel – a band used to bind a Torah scroll closed when it is not being read – made from a strip of the cloth used to swaddle her son during his circumcision ceremony, often called a bris or brit milah.In her book "" Painted Pomegranates and Needlepoint Rabbis ,"" religion scholar Jodi Eichler-Levine analyzes this practice as a way for new mothers, confined to the women's section of the synagogue, to insert themselves into what is otherwise an all-male ritual space.Describing the emergence of a modern Jewish crafting movement, Eichler-Levine also notes that ""in recent years, the wimpel has made a comeback,"" created by mothers and grandmothers to honor the birth of children regardless of their sex.  When my oldest child was born 26 years ago, options for celebrating her birth in the Jewish community in Johannesburg, South Africa, were limited. After we brought her home from the hospital, my husband and I attended Shabbat services at the Orthodox synagogue he had grown up in.    As I looked on from behind the mehitza, the screen that separates men's and women's areas in Orthodox congregations, he was honored by being called up to the Torah during the service, and our daughter's name was announced to the community.    I, on the other hand, was encouraged to privately bentsch gommel: recite the prayer for having survived an illness or a perilous journey.    Then we went home. And that was it. This seemed an underwhelming way to acknowledge her arrival and my having given birth to her.    Elsewhere, Jewish feminists had begun creating new rituals to mark moments in women's and girls' lives – but in the late 1990s, that innovation was not yet felt in Johannesburg.    I located a copy of ""The New Jewish Baby Book,"" imported from the United States. Written by essayist and novelist Anita Diamant, the guide included sample rituals for welcoming the birth of a girl.    Together with my mother-in-law, a psychoanalyst who loved to cater a stylish celebration, and my sister-in-law, a journalist with a gift for powerful public speech, we crafted a ritual to take place in my in-law's home that announced our daughter's name and offered the women in our family a more significant role.  It was an opportunity for me, as her mother, to acknowledge the beloved grandmothers and biblical figures for whom she was named and to express my hopes that a life of meaning, connection, and community lay ahead of her.  Tradition for the 21st Century  Though we didn't realize it at the time, the ritual we created reflected many themes of contemporary Jewish feminist innovation.  In the book "" Inventing Jewish Ritual ,"" anthropologist Vanessa Ochs describes how a movement among liberal Jews to engage in ritual innovation began in the 1970s.  Alongside secular do-it-yourself texts like ""Our Bodies, Ourselves,"" which urged women to take ownership over their sexual and reproductive health, Jewish women began to design novel rituals that marked transformative moments in women's lives.  These included moments that had long gone unremarked in Jewish public life, including the onset of menstruation, pregnancy, birth, miscarriage, infertility, abortion, and menopause.    Our family ritual shared many features with those being developed by other Jewish parents around the world. My daughter's naming ceremony was created from a template that allowed for improvisation and personalization. It enabled a new shared experience, and it took place outside the synagogue, in the less regulated space of a private home.    Rituals to mark the birth of girls are now widely accepted across all Jewish denominations. Templates and sample prayers are available in books like Israeli professor and politician Aliza Lavie's anthology, ""A Jewish Woman's Prayer Book,"" and websites like ritualwell.org.    More recently, new rituals have been created to allow a woman to reflect upon the impact that becoming a mother has on her life.  The mikveh, or ritual bath, plays a central role in observance of Jewish laws relating to family purity, which may involve women immersing after menstruation and after giving birth.    Jewish feminists have sought to reclaim the practice of ritual immersion to mark other developments in women's lives, including becoming a mother, and to shift the focus of ritual from the moment of transition in status to the shift in perspective brought by occupying a new role.    The poet Hila Ratzabi, for example, created ""A Rebirth Ritual for Mothers"" to be used at any time after a birth, providing an opportunity to reflect on how becoming a mother has transformed one's life.  The ritual includes sharing reflections on the challenging and empowering moments in the birth, the experience of motherhood and the experience of immersion, and includes these touching words:  As I step toward these healing waters, I acknowledge the great transitions I underwent in becoming a mother.  I come to the mikveh to acknowledge that these powerful birth experiences made me a mother, and I choose to step into my power.  I come to the mikveh to remind myself that I am always loved, always held, always growing, always whole."

Yoga Spirituality oi-Pundreeka Valli  Kesari, the king of monkeys and Anjanadevi, a cursed nymph or apsara were the parents to Lord Hanuman. We can see that in scriptures Hanuman is also addressed as Kesari Nandan, Anjani putra.  The best example would be chalisa where both these names are mentioned while singing his praises.He is the most ardent devotee of Lord Rama who treated him as his own brother.  There is a strong background to the belief that Ram and Hanuman were real brothers. Let us delve into this relationship to know more about it.  It so coincided that Anjani was meditating on Lord Shiva in order to get a son like him. On the other side, in Dasharathas palace, the putrakameshthi yaga was being conducted.  Both the Tapasya and homa had only one purpose-of begetting a progeny. During Dasharathas yagnya, finally , as an answer to his prayer, Agnideva appeared with a golden kalash in his hand which he intended to give Dasharatha. The kalasha had nectar like sweet stew or payasa.  Agni instructed Dasharatha that this payasa should be consumed by his queens so that they can conceive. As per this instruction, king was taking Payasa to the antahpura in the palace. Antahpura is the queen's cabin or room inside the palace.  As he was carrying the kalasha in his hand, as luck would have it, an eagle swooped down near him, took a large mouthful of the payasa and flew away to the place where Anjani was worshipping Lord Shiva for a son.  Lord Shiva appeared before her and asked her to lift up her hands and keep her palms ready for receiving something. It was at this point that the eagle flew towards her and unable to gulp the payasa, it dropped it into Anjana's hand.  Anjani consumed it thinking that it was Lord Shivas will and boon to her. She gave birth to Hanuman as a result, got rid of her curse, and got back her original form os an apsara. Here the royal queens too gave birth to kids.  Kausalya gave birth to Rama. Here the most important point to note is that both Rama and Hanuman were conceived by their mothers after consuming the same payasa. So, it is only right to call them as brothers.  Although the women who consumed the payasa were different and were married to different people, the payasa that was taken by these women was the same.  It was responsible for helping the women conceive. Hence although this fact is not mentioned in Valmiki Ramayana, Ananda Ramayana carries this information and tale. Ananda Ramayana is an abridged form of Adhyatma Ramayana written by Sage Valmiki.  But It is not surprising to believe, knowing the power of both Hanuman and Rama and their relationship, that Hanuman was a true brother of Rama. He proved himself as true brother to Ram in his avatar in Treta yuga. He deserved to be Ramas brother from any angle.  GET THE BEST BOLDSKY STORIES!

The first, near universal moment is buying a “real” bike. Then, once the triathlon mania sets in, you want to get better, so you level up again. Maybe you’ll join a club or hire a coach. Next comes a power meter or a smart trainer. Then it’s downloading Zwift.  For the unindoctrinated few, Zwift is part training tool and part video game. It makes indoor bike training actually fun—and to some–even addictive; so addictive that some triathletes have given up riding outdoors altogether except on race days.  Riding indoors is the answer to a bunch of problems, including bad weather, bad roads and bad drivers. For young parents, it’s the solution to finding a babysitter or negotiating with a partner over who stays home. Yet, for all its upsides, riding indoors without the aid of distraction is mind-numbingly boring.  Boredom is the Mother of Invention  This was the reality faced in 2010 by California-based programmer Jon Mayfield: recently married, with a new home and a baby on the way, the new house was within eyesight of southern California’s Santa Ana River Trail, which every weekend attracted hundreds of local cyclists. One hybrid bike later and Mayfield was a newly minted cyclist. Flash forward six months and he’d upgraded to a cherry-red Specialized Roubaix, but with a newborn, getting out on the trail just wasn’t going to happen.  Meanwhile in another part of the world, tech entrepreneur Eric Min was thinking about a new challenge. He’d spent eight years as a VP at JP Morgan Chase in New York City, then had co-founded a London-based software company, where he’d spent another 15 years. But Min’s other passion was cycling.  Min had begun riding seriously at age 14 with Olympic aspirations. A successful amateur, he made it all the way to Olympic training camp. He loved racing, but almost equally, he loved the culture of cycling: the group rides, with guys jockeying for position and showing each other up, the trash talk, the bravado. He loved the social rides and friendships, the endless chats about gear and training.  And as a serious amateur, Min recognized the value in off-season indoor riding. But he hated it. Whether on rollers or a bike trainer, his indoor training was effective, but so boring. There was no one to talk to, no one to ride with, no one to compete against.  Around 2012, Min’s business life and personal passion converged. He found himself at a career crossroads, casting about for a  “Big Idea,” but it seemed that all the great new tech ideas were taken. His brother urged him to pursue combining what he knew best: technology and cycling.  Indoor Cycling was Spinning its Wheels  Both Min and Mayfield knew that indoor cycling had stagnated. The same basic bike trainers had been around for years. For triathletes and cyclists, one viable solution was CompuTrainer, which used proprietary hardware to control a trainer’s resistance on the rear tire. The company pioneered the electronic bike trainer, and for two decades was the only real player in the game.  Long before Garmin, the CompuTrainer setup allowed riders to collect and view cycling data, displayed on a screen during a ride. While revolutionary in the 90’s and 2000s, CompuTrainer had limitations. There were wires between the trainer and head unit, which complicated setup. You had to calibrate and warm up the system for a good 15-minutes before starting a ride or your numbers would be off. And the system was expensive. In today’s dollars, it would set you back more than $2,500, clearly out of reach for most.  And CompuTrainer was a closed system. It didn’t work with emerging wireless standards like WiFi, Bluetooth or ANT+. While the system included some rudimentary graphics, riders had just a plain road and a few blobby trees to look at, with a distant skyline or landscape. To facilitate group rides, bike shops would set up CompuTrainer studios, where cyclists could mount their bikes to a line of CompuTrainer systems side-by-side.  Enter the Disrupter  Zwift is the confluence of right time, right place, right people. A few years earlier and the technology would have been too expensive or too obscure. A few years later and other startups might have snatched market share. And if two people that had never met each other didn’t meet, then the know-how + investment + passion, with a big dose of nerdiness that resulted in Zwift would have never happened.  By 2013 Jon Mayfield had developed his own sophisticated solution for indoor training. Teaching himself to code, he gradually improved his “CRBike Coach” software. He was the only user.  Mayfield had created the graphics for video games for years, with credits on games such as Disney Princess: My Fairytale Adventure, Dreamworks Kartz, and Phineas and Ferb. His cycling program began as a little project over a Christmas vacation, where he wrote his first few lines of code in his home’s guest bedroom. He iterated on his side project for years, adding the ability to capture cycling data through a power meter and evolving the visuals. The very first virtual bike for the program was based on his own cherry-red Roubaix.  He began posting about his software on triathlon forums like Slowtwitch, looking for a partner or investor. He thought about creating a Kickstarter to try to find funding to make CRBike Coach into a real consumer product. Eric Min saw one of those forum posts and connected with Mayfield. By early 2014, they were co-founders of a yet-to-be-named project.  Gamer + Trainer  As Mayfield tinkered in his spare room, he drafted features that are at still for the core of Zwift: that at its heart, it’s a video game.  In an interview with Slowtwitch, Mayfield said, “I often get asked ‘Is Zwift a game or a training tool?’ It’s an odd question because training, to me, has always been a game. Whether I was trying to optimize my CdA in aerolab, trying to best my current FTP, or trying to move up a few percent on the local Strava segment, it’s always been gamified in my mind.”  His first version of his ‘game’ merely collected and graphed data from the bike on a screen. By 2011, he had developed a joystick that could be used to ‘steer’ in the game to collect coins while riding. From there, he figured out how to pause and return to the game, and he started using ANT+ wireless connectivity to communicate with the bike sensors.  Then came better graphics and some AI ‘riders’ to ride against. He made an Android app that could connect to the software over his WiFi network so a phone could be used as a display and input device.  By early 2014, he had added what he called “pain portals” that represented the start and end of an interval. Zwift users today will recognize those ‘portal’ entries; most now look like inflated archways, and riders still collect coins and points in the game.  After Min reached out, Mayfield hosted Min and co-founder Scott Barger in that same spare room to demonstrate his project. His heart was racing, finally getting to show his passion project to potential partners. He’d accidently left his heart-rate monitor on, so  Min and Barger were able to see just how nervous he was, with his HR graphed on the display screen while they spoke.  The World of Zwift  With a unified vision and the funding to match, the new company ramped up quickly, and by late 2014 was in beta testing. It officially launched to the public in October 2015, with a choice of two riding environments, the fantastical “Watopia” and the more realistic Richmond.  It’s a little disappointing that the company’s name wasn’t the result of a half-asleep, in-the-shower eureka, but rather, evolved out of sessions with a marketing agency. Even so, it’s apt, meant to suggest both motion and fun.  What started as a way to make cycling less boring has evolved into a powerhouse across cycling and triathlon. For around $15 per month and a compatible bike trainer, anyone ride one of Zwift’s nine virtual worlds, and users can make it as much of a game as they want. You can customize your avatar by switching out gear and clothing. The longer you use the program, the points you rack up, which allows you to “buy” upgrades within the game.  Just as with any video game, players reach levels (there are 50 levels currently), and receive badges and awards. But one of the most loved aspects of Zwift is the social integration. At any point, you’ll see a list of riders on the course with you, and they’re not AI…they’re actual people from around the world.  Through the Zwift companion app, you can text other riders, or give them a “thumbs up.” The companion app also makes group rides possible. You can organize a meetup with friends or teammates, attend “celebrity” rides with pro cyclists and triathletes, and join pace groups. The Zwift platform hosts dozens of races every week, including the Zwift Racing League.  The exact number of subscribers around the world isn’t publicly available, but it’s believed that there are around 500,000 users worldwide.  It has been reported that subscribers nearly doubled during the pandemic. With no live events, and everyone stuck at home, Zwift was the perfect companion. The countries with the highest number of Zwift users included Spain and Italy, countries hard-hit by lockdowns.  According to Richard Melik, sports-marketing lead for Zwift, the pandemic accelerated some plans Zwift had already been discussing. Namely, a series of races featuring the world’s best triathletes. That became the Z PRO Race Series, which featured triathletes in their home pain caves competing for significant prize money.  Says Melik, “It was surreal to see athletes of the caliber of Gustav Iden, Kristian Blummenfelt, the Brownlee brothers, Flora Duffy, Georgia Taylor-Brown and Chelsea Sodaro all mixing it up on the roads of Watopia.”  What’s Next: Live Racing  Just as eSports evolved to live events where an audience watches elite gamers play World of Warcraft and other games in a auditoriums and arenas, Zwift has followed suit.  What started as a race series in triathletes living rooms has morphed into an entirely new type of event: a hybrid live/virtual triathlon.  Dubbed the Super League Arena Games, this year’s series of three events featured a live audience watching pro triathletes compete in a hybrid environment. A pool swim was followed by live bike racing on trainers through Zwift’s virtual world, then a treadmill run, also through the fantasy environment of Zwift. It’s fast-paced, with athletes switching disciplines multiple times, all displayed for spectators on massive screens with pumping music and commentary.  Along with the PTO and Challenge/Clash, part of Zwift’s aim is to turn triathlon into a prime-time watchable sport with professional athletes and a legion of fans to follow them. The next events in the series, which began in Montreal, include events in Switzerland and Singapore. Spectators can watch in person or choose to stream the event, and the spectacle opens a new revenue stream for pros.  Says Melik: “We know that shorter formats of triathlon appeal to a wider broadcast audience. The Mixed Team Relays at the Olympics have been the gold standard in attracting a non-endemic audience to the sport and there are elements of Arena Games that mean it is well placed to do the same.”  For an age group triathlete using Zwift at home, watching the pros riding on Zwift is a thrill. Another level-up moment you won’t easily forget? Seeing Lionel Sanders or Lucy Charles-Barclay pass you while you’re riding one of the Zwift courses.  New to Zwift? The company offers a 7-day free trial to check it out. But we’ll warn you: it’s easy to find yourself addicted!"

The 10-year-old mother musk ox was evidently already pregnant when she arrived at Korkeasaari from a zoo in Cologne about half a year ago, so Kili's father also has German roots. Kili is not the mother's first calf, as she had also given birth in Cologne before.  The mother was brought to Helsinki with the aim to increase the zoo's musk ox herd.  There are only about 80 musk oxen in zoos around Europe. The species was on the verge of extinction due to excessive hunting about a century ago, but conservation efforts have improved the situation and as a species, musk oxen populations are now considered to be stable.

He previously held the roles of Minister of Irrigation in H. D. Kumaraswamy's cabinet and Minister of Energy in the Government of Karnataka during Siddaramaiah's tenure. Additionally, he represents the Kanakapura constituency as an MLA.  Karnataka's secure future and our peoples welfare is our top priority, and we are united in guaranteeing that. pic.twitter.com/sNROprdn5H — DK Shivakumar (@DKShivakumar) May 18, 2023  Early Life and Education  Born on May 15, 1962, in Kanakapura, Karnataka, India, D.K. Shivakumar is a prominent figure belonging to the Vokkaliga community, an influential political and social group in Karnataka. He has a younger brother named D.K. Suresh, who is also actively involved in politics.  Political Career  Shivakumar embarked on his political journey in the early 1980s, initially as a student leader. In 1984, he became president of the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) student wing. His political ascent continued as he secured his first election victory in 1989, representing the Sathanur constituency in the Karnataka Legislative Assembly. The prominent politician has been successfully re-elected to the Assembly eight times, reflecting his enduring popularity among the constituents.  Throughout his career, Shivakumar has assumed several ministerial roles within the Karnataka government. From 1999 to 2004, he served as the Minister of State for Home in the S.M. Krishna government. In the Siddaramaiah government, from 2013 to 2018, he held the portfolios of Minister of Energy and Minister of Large and Medium Industries.  As a senior leader and active member of the Congress Party, Shivakumar is recognised for his charismatic demeanour and his ability to forge connections with the masses. He is renowned for his flamboyant style and unwavering commitment to championing the rights of society's underprivileged and marginalised sections.  Personal Life  Shivakumar is married to Usha, and they have two daughters and one son. His eldest daughter, Aishwarya, is married to Amartya Hegde, the son of Café Coffee Day founder V.G. Siddhartha.  Controversies  Shivakumar's political journey has been marred by several controversies. One significant incident occurred in 2019, when he was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on charges of money laundering. After spending over 50 days in jail, he was eventually granted bail.  In addition to the money laundering case, Shivakumar has faced allegations of corruption and nepotism. In 2017, he was accused of favouring his son-in-law, Amartya Hegde, in the allocation of a government contract, raising concerns about preferential treatment.  Despite these controversies, Shivakumar continues to wield influence and maintain popularity in Karnataka politics. He was initially regarded as a prominent figure capable of potentially assuming the role of Chief Minister in the future. However, in a recent update, Siddharamaiah will soon be announced as Karnataka’s CM, and Shivakumar will be his deputy. The veteran political leader has said that he has to “sacrifice in the interest of the party”"

Catherine Ortiz-Caridad, 34, and Wilson Canan-Cruz, 24, were arrested on Monday after an investigation into an April 23 incident on Wilton Farm Road.  According to Albemarle County Police, Ortiz-Caridad, Canan-Cruz and a third person, a woman whose name was not released, were arguing over the custody of an infant when police were called to the scene on April 23.  With the assistance of Albemarle County Department of Social Services and Homeland Security Investigation, ACPD detectives learned that the infant’s biological mother had temporarily placed her baby in the care of relatives while she established herself in another state. When the infant’s mother returned to Virginia, the temporary guardians prevented the mother access to the infant, and they subsequently presented themselves to the police as the biological parents.  The infant, who has been in the custody of ACDSS since the April 23 incident, was returned to the out-of-state mother after a DNA test confirmed she was the biological parent.  Canan-Cruz and Ortiz-Caridad are being held at the Charlottesville Albemarle Regional Jail without bond.

But one mum-to-be was left gobsmacked when her mother-in-law came up with a ""money-saving suggestion"" to help cut down on costs - as it turned out there was a pretty hefty catch.  The woman, who is from the US, explained her hospital bill for delivering her baby will come to around $8,000 (£6,400), so she and her husband are currently trying to save as much money as possible before the baby arrives.  So, when her mother-in-law asked to borrow $300 (£240), they had to refuse and tried to explain why before she came up with her own cost-cutting solution - delivering the baby herself.  Image: Getty Images) Getty Images)  In a post on Reddit, the mum-to-be said: ""Last night my husband got a call from his mum asking would we give his sister money ($300) to attend a funeral out of town next month for their uncle. My husband's family is pretty bad with money and his sister and his mum both currently owe us thousands.  ""I pull up records I have of what they owe and for what to give my husband context during the call, and remind him that thanks to my cr***y insurance, we're going to be on the hook for an $8k hospital bill in a couple of months. He relayed the hospital bill information to my MIL, saying sorry mum, we have some significant expenses coming up and can't afford to pay for her ticket.  ""He tells her how much the bill will be and cue the shouting. 'Why are you doing that?!' 'Why don't you just have the baby at home?', which I would honestly prefer, but it'd be $13k (£10.4k) if we tried at home and then had to transfer. The shouting continues … 'I had all my babies at home! I have some midwifery experience, I'll just deliver the baby myself!'""  The mum-to-be was horrified at the idea of her mother-in-law delivering her baby, as she explained that while she did give birth to all six of her children at home, half of the births resulted in ""serious infections"" that left her hospitalised.  Understandably, the mum-to-be refused to put her health at risk just so she could give her cash away to her husband's family instead.  She added: ""Yes, she had 6 kids at home, BUT my idiot father-in-law left CHUNKS of placenta inside her and she got pretty serious infections 3 of the 6 times. All infections required a minimum 2-day hospital stay, and she's honestly lucky to be alive.  ""Problem two, she likely has the same 'training' idiot FIL received in the 70s and putting aside that her knowledge is sorely out of date, she's not a licensed midwife. Problem three, I don't want her within five miles of me when I'm having this baby, let alone near my bits catching my son.  ""Problem four, you're only offering this so we'll give you more money??? No.""  Commenters on the post were equally as horrified, with many saying the couple's money should all be going toward their child from now on, not their other relatives.  One person said: ""I thought this was going to be a sweet story about your MIL being an ob-gyn … This took a turn. And please don’t give them any more money. All of that should be going to your own child.""  While another added: ""I would personally stop talking to this woman and put your partner in charge of it. Stop sharing your expenses - they don't need those receipts - and start embracing no as a complete sentence. And don't entertain this stupid home birth plan.""  And a third wrote: ""How disgustingly selfish of your MIL. She wants you to sacrifice the birth of your baby so you can afford to 'loan' her daughter money?

But a liberal social media post mischaracterizes their opposition by claiming Republicans said girls “should be allowed to be forced to give birth to their rapist’s baby if the rapist is their father.”  Full Story  Oregon Democrats have proposed legislation aimed at removing barriers to abortion and gender-affirming care, while Republican lawmakers have pushed back against the measure, saying it goes too far.  Social media posts from each side have focused on the bill’s proposed change to abortion access laws — in particular, parental consent requirements for some minors.  Current state law is a little unclear about the rules for parental consent for those under 15, but experts generally agree that those older than 15 can seek an abortion without consent from their parents and those younger than 15 cannot.  The law says that a medical provider can give “birth control information and services to any person without regard to the age of the person” and then, in the next paragraph, specifies that only those 15 and older can decide on medical treatment without the consent of a parent.  “Current law is that if someone is under 15, she’ll need to get consent from a parent to get an abortion in Oregon. If she’s 16 or 17, she doesn’t need parental consent to get an abortion in Oregon,” Anna Sortun, an Oregon lawyer who is contributing to a reproductive rights hotline run by the state’s attorney general, said in an email to FactCheck.org.  Similarly, the state Supreme Court wrote in a non-binding 2006 opinion that the current law “authorizes a minor female 15 years of age or older to consent to the performance of an abortion by a physician without the consent of the minor’s parent or guardian. A parent or guardian still must consent to the performance of an abortion for a minor female 14 years of age or younger.”  The proposed change — which has passed the Democrat-led House and is now awaiting a vote in the Democrat-controlled Senate — would definitively establish that people of any age could seek out reproductive health care, including abortion, without parental consent.  Under this bill, “a minor of any age can make that determination,” Lori Anne Sills, of the nonpartisan legislative counsel’s office, explained at an April 13 meeting of the Joint Committee on Ways and Means, which is made up of members from both chambers.  At that meeting, Republican state Sen. Tim Knopp asked Sills, “a 10-year-old could make that decision on their own, then?”  “Yes,” Sills said. “Let me clarify… under the House Bill 2002, a minor of any age can make reproductive health care decisions and that includes undergoing an abortion.”  “Alright, well, that’s just shocking,” Knopp said.  Knopp, the Senate Republican leader, released a joint statement with the Republican leader of the House later that day highlighting that point, saying, “10-year-olds would be able to get abortions without parental knowledge under the legislation.”  The official Twitter account for the Oregon House Republicans then emphasized that part of the bill on May 1, calling the measure “too extreme.”  But a popular liberal Twitter account run by Brian Tyler Cohen later misleadingly claimed on May 2: “Oregon Republicans are arguing that 10-year-old girls should be allowed to be forced to give birth to their rapist’s baby if the rapist is their father.”  But none of the Republicans had suggested that a 10-year-old should be forced to give birth. Rather, they argued that parents should be involved in medical decision-making for minors.  For example, the conservative-leaning organization Oregon Right to Life, which opposes the bill, submitted written testimony that said, in part, “Although we can agree that not every parent is a good parent (such as in cases of abuse), we recognize that parental involvement is wise in every other major decision in a child’s life. Removing parental involvement prior to making a life-changing decision significantly changes how minors consent to abortions. Parents should be empowered to help and support their children during a vulnerable and confusing time, not removed from the equation.”  Addressing Parental Permission  During the April 13 committee meeting, Democratic state Sen. Elizabeth Steiner — who is a doctor and a sponsor of the bill — responded to criticism that the change would cut out parents from major health decisions.  “While I firmly believe that every person in this room would have compassion on their 14-year-old child and want to engage with them on this conversation in a loving and caring way,” she said, “I can tell you from deep personal experience that, unfortunately, not every parent is like that.”  In most cases, though, a physician would encourage parental involvement, Steiner said.  “There is no desire to separate children from their parents in this,” she said.  The Oregon Attorney General’s Sexual Assault Task Force — which is a statewide non-profit that works to prevent and respond to sexual violence and is not part of the Department of Justice, as is suggested by the name — favors the legislation.  “If we want survivors of abuse and violence to have access to meaningful support services, we need to support reproductive health care,” the organization’s interim executive director, Bethany Walmsley, wrote in testimony submitted in support of the bill. “If we want to prevent abuse and violence from happening in the first place, we need to ensure people have access to health services without barriers.”  It’s rare for those under 15 to seek abortion, regardless of whether or not they are required to have parental permission.  In 2021, there were 14 abortions performed on patients younger than 15 in the state, according to the Oregon Health Authority. In the year before, there were 20 abortions.  That accounts for 0.3% of the state’s abortions in 2021, which is on par with the rates for that age group in other states regardless of parental consent laws, according to national data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Parental consent laws vary by state, with some requiring consent from one parent, a grandparent or other adult relative. According to the Guttmacher Institute, 36 states require parental consent and/or notification or the involvement of a family member, although a minor can obtain court approval for an abortion in all but one of those states.  We don’t know how many 10-year-olds would likely be affected since there is no data available for that age group and the bill’s primary sponsors didn’t answer our email seeking clarification. But few would likely be affected given the relatively low number of abortions and the similarly low number of births among those under 15. (There were 11 births in that age group in Oregon in 2021 and 10 in 2020.)  Hannah Kurowski, spokeswoman for the Oregon House Majority Office, which is Democratic, told us, “No minor in Oregon is ever alone in making these decisions.”  “Medical providers, who are trained to screen for abuse and protect the health and wellbeing of their patients, will always work with minor patients to ensure they have a network of safe adults to support them, especially when they are making significant medical decisions,” she said. “This bill does not change that.” (Emphasis is Kurowski’s.)  So, the focus among Republicans on the effect of the bill for that young age exaggerates its impact.  But the response from the liberal Twitter account mischaracterizes the point Republican opponents were making.

Speaking at a press conference in Abuja on Wednesday, Faisal Shuaib, NPHCDA director general, said the agency set up the national emergency, maternal and child health intervention centre (NEMCHIC) to provide oversight on maternal and newborn health in Nigeria.  Faisal said the agency also carried out a national health facility assessment in 2022 in a bid to close the gaps of inadequate distribution of human resources at the primary healthcare level.  “Findings from the assessment revealed that only 1.8% (463 out of 25,843) primary health care facilities in our country have the minimum number of required skilled birth attendants (SBA) which is four per facility. Aside from the gross inadequacy, there is the problem of unequal distribution of available SBAs in the PHC facilities,” he said.  Advertisement  He said the agency developed an innovation called community-based health research, innovative training and services program (CRISP) to address the inadequacy.  He said the CRISP will be launched on May 22 at the Banquet Hall of the State House.  “CRISP is a partnership between the teaching hospitals, federal medical centres, NPHCDA, state primary health care boards, local government health authorities and the communities to support primary health care development,” he said.  Advertisement  “The intervention specifically focuses on increasing, retaining and improving the quality, adequacy, competency, and distribution of a committed multidisciplinary primary health care workforce that includes facility outreach and community-based health workers supported through effective management supervision and appropriate compensation.  “CRISP aims to leverage the rural posting of resident doctors from teaching hospitals to boost and guarantee the quality of care at the PHC level through their active involvement in primary health service delivery. This is targeted at improving reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health, amongst other health services within the benefiting communities.  “In addition, human resources for health (HRH), particularly skilled birth attendants, such as medical doctors, midwives, nurses, and community health extension workers (CHEWs) that have been trained on how to manage emergencies would be recruited and deployed to priority PHC facilities across the country.”"

Starting April 1, people in BC were able to receive free prescription contraceptives like copper and hormonal IUDs, which PharmaCare will fully cover.  Before this policy kicked in, Renee Hall, the medical co-director at Willow Clinic in Vancouver, said there was already a high demand for IUDs.  However, this birth control device costs around $400 for people without medical coverage.  So when the intrauterine device became free for British Columbians, “that’s when our phone calls definitely went up, and those who are interested but weren’t able to afford them before, or those who were interested but didn’t like the idea of committing financially to something like that, are now interested in giving it a go,” Hall said. “A lot of people find it really convenient.”  In just two days, the Willow Clinic received about 350 appointment requests and an additional 50 referrals from doctors asking for its help to insert IUDs, Hall said.  By mid-May, Hall said the clinic must have received more than a thousand appointment requests.  “The wait time used to be one to two weeks, and now it’s more in the order of two months,” Hall said. “That’s the part that’s concerning and where we’re raising the alarms.”  Free IUDs in a box are useless without doctors to insert them  Hall explained that over the past few years, there had been an increase in IUD clinics and, “unfortunately,” many doctors and nurse practitioners are dropping the skill of IUD insertion.  She said the reason for the decline of doctors able to insert IUDs is because “It’s not very well remunerated.”  “It is a skill, and it takes time to get trained, and it takes time to master,” she said. “Regardless of how good you are at it, there’s always going to be ones that are difficult. So doctors would find that they are spending a lot of money on the equipment and sterilization of the equipment and not being paid well enough for the insertion.”  “So it started to become more convenient to send them to specialized IUD centres that do it all the time,” Hall said.  However, clinics around the region are reporting demand and long waitlists too.  While it’s “wonderful” to have access to free contraception, “an IUD in a box that’s free is not very useful. We need to be able to have access to the people who insert them,” said Hall.  Hall suggests IUD insertion should be incentivized so more doctors would be willing to train to do it or expand some of those IUD specialized clinics as well, and funding them might help so that women can get the IUD they want when they want."

Under surgery, she was able to give birth to four of her kittens, although another was also stillborn.  RSPCA animal rescue officer Melanie Froude says the cat, who has been named Lily, looked to have been well cared for before her surgery and while she is not microchipped the officer is appealing for her owner to get in touch or for anyone who may know of her background.  “It was very fortunate that someone noticed this poor cat struggling by the side of the road. The lady realised she was in difficulty and took her back to her home in nearby Dodleston before calling us,” said the animal rescue officer.  “We were able to give Lily the care she needed and she gave birth to four kittens, who are doing well.

The girl's counsel said she has achieved a huge amount in relation to motor and cognitive functions “thanks to the exemplary and total care” provided by her parents.  Liam Reidy SC, instructed by Cantillons Solicitors, said the girl’s mother had opted for the Domino Scheme in CUMH, which involves midwife-led care and natural labour and delivery. It was their case that the baby girl suffered a brain injury at birth.  Approving the settlement, which allows for an interim payment for the next five years, Mr Justice Paul Coffey praised the girl’s parents for “the magnificent care they have given her since her birth”.  Advertisement  The girl had, through her mother, sued the HSE. Liability was admitted in the case, but the court heard causation was still in issue.  Interim payment  The €1.35 million payment is for the next five years, at which point the case will come back before the court when her future care needs will be assessed.  The mother attended at CUMH in June 2016 having experienced strong contractions.  She was seen by a midwife, a CTG trace was started, and fetal movements were reported as good. The mother then was transferred to the maternity ward before being moved to the delivery suite.  It was claimed that it was agreed the CTG, which monitors the baby’s heart rate, would be reviewed during the obstetric ward rounds for the early morning shift handover, but it was alleged the review did not take place. When the baby was born later, she was in poor condition.  The girl’s mother told the court the birth of her daughter had been very traumatic as she did not breathe immediately, and she had to have brain cooling treatment for the first four days of her life, which meant they could not hold her. She added an MRI later showed a brain injury.  In the proceedings, it was claimed there was a failure to carry out a requested obstetric review of the CTG trace during a two-hour period on the morning of the delivery when, it was claimed, the CTG trace was unusual or difficult to interpret or when there was a non-reassuring fetal heart rate pattern.  Ireland Trial of man accused of murdering Ashling Murphy p...

The patient is a 36-year-old woman who is 3 days postpartum after a spontaneous vaginal delivery. She has a headache and just arrived home after hospital discharge. She's calling because after using the blood pressure cuff that the hospital sent her home with, her reading is > 150/90 mm Hg, indicating that she is hypertensive.  You try to pull up her records but realize her delivery hospital isn't part of your system's electronic health record. What do you do?  This scenario was presented at a session of the annual meeting of the Society of General Internal Medicine during a panel focused on providing care in the fourth trimester as patients transition between ob/gyn care and primary care.  ""If you send her to the emergency room, she might get sent home,"" Chloe Zera, MD, MPH, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, said. ""I would strongly recommend you figure out where she delivered and tell her to go back there because she will almost certainly get readmitted for blood pressure control.""  When stepping in to treat someone who recently gave birth, Zera said that clinicians have to be mindful that though many of the deaths of mothers and infants occur on the day of birth, a substantial proportion occur within the first 6-7 weeks postpartum. Clinicians must be aware of possible complications and ask probing questions if they don't have a patient's medical records at hand.  ""Maternal mortality is a crisis in the United States, which is probably reflective of the sort of social and political realities we're living in right now,"" Zera, an associate professor in obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive biology at Harvard Medical School, said. ""About 700 women die each year in the US from a pregnancy or its complications.""  Zera recommended that clinicians ask about a patient's birth story specifically, at how many weeks they gave birth, what kind of delivery they had, and whether they were they induced for any reason.  ""Everybody's birth story is really important in their lives, people know the details and want to talk about their birth stories,"" she said.  Starting Point  Clinicians should start out by asking questions regarding how the patient delivered but also how much their baby weighed at birth.  ""Both really small and really large babies are associated with later maternal complications,"" Zera said. ""For example, an 8-lb baby at 34 weeks is off the charts while at 42 weeks, that's totally normal.""  Clinicians should also ask about complications prior to the birth, which might include questions regarding high blood pressure, blood sugar concerns, hospitalizations before birth, length of stay for the birth, and whether their infant had a neonatal intensive care stay.  Any of these factors can weigh into adverse pregnancy outcomes. Experiencing a hypertensive pregnancy, for example, can put patients at a higher risk for cardiovascular events, and up to 10% of all pregnancies are complicated by hypertensive disorders.  Women who experience preeclampsia have two to four times the risk for coronary heart disease.  Hypertensive pregnancies can also result in patients developing posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and even producing less milk, according to Ann Celi, MD, MPH, an internal medicine specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital.  More Questions  Celi, who spoke on the panel, runs a clinic that helps people transition back to a primary care provider after a hypertensive pregnancy. She said that she wants to help clinicians better manage the shift.  Clinicians can probe patients on how much sleep they're getting and whether a support system is present back at home. These are all related to the recovery process, and Celi recommended that clinicians encourage their patients to prioritize asking for help from external sources.  ""Bring in your community: 'Do you have some best friends from work or somebody who might be able to help with meals? Is there someone in the family that could travel to help [you] as [you're] recovering? Is the father of the baby involved? Can they help?'"" Celi, offering question suggestions for clinicians to ask, said.  Celi also recommended that clinicians prescribe hypertensive-friendly birth control options as part of a follow-up care plan, such as progestin-only birth control pills.  They also recommend that clinicians evaluate women with a history of preeclampsia 3-6 months after a birth for cardiovascular risk factors, with an annual follow-up on blood pressure, body mass index, fasting glucose or A1c, and lipids.  Follow-Up Care  ""At least 40% of people don't even make it to that 6-week visit, and we lose them,"" Zera said. ""It turns out, having a pregnancy complication does not make it any more likely that you're going to come to your postpartum visit.""  For some patients, insurance coverage often changes after delivery. For example, in states without a Medicaid extension or expansion, the program is only required to provide 60 days of coverage after delivery. Even among patients with commercial insurance, churn rates are high. People may quit their jobs and switch to their partner's insurance or get a new job with a different insurance plan. If the new insurance doesn't include the patient's established clinician, they may switch clinicians or skip the follow-up appointment entirely.  Another barrier to care is patients feeling like their doctors don't care about them, Zera said.  ""This is kind of simple stuff, but bond with your patients,"" she said. ""Tell them, 'I want to see you when you're pregnant and beyond,' because that makes a huge difference.""  No relevant financial relationships were reported.

File photo: Shutterstock  DAB lawmaker Nixie Lam says the government could put more effort into helping citizens reproduce, claiming that it takes too long for women to get fertility treatments in the public health system.    During a question and answer session in the Legislative Council on Wednesday, concerns were raised over the high cost of treatments, such as IVF, in the private sector.    Lam, who says she paid over HK$200,000 for IVF treatment and is now 32 weeks pregnant, told RTHK it can take 18 months in the public sector before a couple can even see a doctor.    ""In Hong Kong, it's likely that you will be in your mid-30s before you're ready to have a baby,"" she said. ""The timing is basically delayed for women because there is a focus on career, and then finding a partner and getting married. ""    ""However, a lot of other countries do more to help couples. I think there could be policies to support women to have better flexibility on their decisions, and early education – in their 20s – to have body checks to make sure that their bodies are OK.""    Lam said it was ""unfortunate"" that the government had indicated it wouldn't ""intervene"" in family planning, adding that for women who seek help with fertility, the public system is too slow to help.    ""If you go to a private clinic, you don't have to wait for IVF,"" she said. ""You can meet your doctors immediately. But in public hospitals, you'll have to wait 18 months to see a doctor to begin with. That wait lowers your chance of having a baby. We need to see whether we can cut the lines.    ""There are also too many forms and unnecessary data that the government is harvesting, which prolongs the process.""    Lam added that more support from employers could help women to consider having children earlier. ""Hong Kong women are very career-oriented,"" she said. ""But more flexibility from employers, such as allowing part-time working or helping with childcare facilities, would be useful."""

A new Southern Cross University study is seeking midwives for an online survey to understand how their own experience of a personal birth trauma impacts returning to the maternity workplace.  Lead researcher is PhD candidate Lisa Charmer, who is a registered midwife and course coordinator for the Bachelor of Midwifery at Southern Cross University. Her PhD research is entitled Exploring Midwives’ Experience of Primary Birth Trauma.  “There is acknowledgement of the impact of secondary trauma on midwives working with women who have less than an ideal birth,” said Ms Charmer.  “However, when her own baby’s birth is traumatic, very little is known about the impact on midwives’ general health and mental wellbeing as well as on her professional quality of life.”  Primary birth trauma is any perceived trauma experienced by a woman during the birth of her baby that lasts longer than the experience.  “Knowing that secondary trauma impacts at the level of the individual – in this case, midwives – the organisation and society, one can presume there may also be implications when it’s personal birth trauma,” Ms Charmer said.  “The study will investigate what support is offered to midwives who have experienced their own birth trauma and are returning to the maternity workplace.”  Ms Charmer noted that last year Safe Work Australia released a new code of practice that means employers need to protect workers’ mental health.  Study details  This research seeks to understand if having experienced birth trauma does, or does not, impact midwives’ professional quality of life and well-being.  The anonymous online survey will take approximately 20 minutes.  Survey link: shorturl.at/jnzV2  After completing the online survey, midwives can volunteer to participate in an interview.

Hayden Hoskins was born with an omphalocele. Part of Hoskins’s organs formed on the outside of his abdomen in utero.  An omphalocele affects one in every 5,300 newborns. Hoskins’s parents found out their baby had one during a routine ultrasound.  Andy and Kelsea Hoskins traveled from Quincy, Illinois, to Barnes Jewish and Children’s Hospital in St. Louis because the hospitals have a national reputation for treating omphalocele babies. Our cameras were in the delivery room when Hayden was born.  Doctors and his parents wouldn’t know if the birth defect had affected his breathing until he was born. Hayden went to the NICU at Children’s Hospital, where he needed a little help breathing. He would spend the next five and a half months at home, living with the large growth attached to his stomach area.  Most babies must wait about a month to have corrective surgery, but Hayden was ready early. He had corrective surgery to have his sack of organs put back into his abdomen. Doctors told his parents that their son would grow up to be just like other boys his age and shouldn’t suffer any lasting health effects. They told Andy and Kelsea he could have an issue with hernias at some point, but he’s had no problems since his surgery.  FOX 2 caught up with Hayden and his family for the first time since he was born 10 years ago when he traveled to St. Charles recently for a youth soccer game. Hayden has grown into the picture of a healthy 10-year-old. He is a great soccer and hockey player. He loves to mountain bike. He’s so smart, he even skipped a grade in school. Hayden speaks about his condition as a baby very casually.  The only reminders he has are a scar on his stomach and a recording of FOX 2’s story on his complicated birth. He and his family watch the video each year on his birthday. Andy and Kelsea said it was a way to remind them how far they’ve come over the last 10 years and how grateful they are."

It’s also the birthplace of a company that is moving the needle when it comes to plant breeders using it.  It takes special people to give birth to a business in the plant breeding and bioinformatics space, but it takes a special city to inspire those people in the first place.  “The city of Tübingen in southwestern Germany is that very place. Located on the banks of the river Neckar in the Stuttgart region, it has always been a unique spot to live and work, enjoying a small community feel while being home to many highly skilled and knowledgeable people in the scientific field”, says Daniel Huson, professor of algorithms in bioinformatics at the University of Tübingen and member of the scientific advisory board of Computomics.  Its history has everything to do with its status as the Silicon Valley of Germany. Over the centuries, as Tübingen grew and developed, it became a center of trade and commerce, as well as an important academic and cultural hub. In the 15th and 16th centuries, the city experienced major growth and prosperity, with the construction of many important buildings and landmarks that can still be seen today.  It’s now home to Cyber Valley, Europe’s largest research consortium in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) with partners from science and industry. Bringing together academic and corporate expertise in artificial intelligence and machine learning, the community-oriented environment in Tübingen allows for both professional and personal relationships with colleagues.  It’s where Computomics was born in 2012, and where the revolution in machine learning for the plant breeding sector was started.  Ahead of the Curve  Let’s rewind to 2002. Tübingen’s academic programs, particularly in bioinformatics, have always been ahead of the curve, and the influx of students due to the biotech boom led to strong student numbers. At that time (and it’s still the case), the city did not have a dominant large company that stood over everyone else. “That lack of a physical and intellectual monopoly fosters an open and innovative atmosphere that encourages entrepreneurship”, says Sebastian Schultheiss, Managing Director of Computomics.  The core group of Computomics founders — numbering six in total, including Schultheiss and Huson — found themselves working together on campus at the University of Tübingen and the Max Planck Campus.  “We recognized that the emerging field of genomics and the vast amounts of data generated by modern sequencing technologies could provide valuable insights into the genetic basis of plant traits, such as yield, disease resistance and nutritional quality,” Schultheiss says. “So, Computomics was formed with the aim of applying cutting-edge computational methods to solve problems in plant breeding and genomics.”  At the time, plant breeders analyzing these massive data sets needed sophisticated computational tools and expertise to do so, and these were lacking in many plant breeding programs.  The Computomics founders had a vision to bridge this gap by providing state-of-the-art bioinformatics and computational biology services to plant breeding programs, helping them to leverage the power of genomics for crop improvement.  “Of course, no company sees success overnight. The challenge of securing funding and acquiring customers while building the business was real,” Schultheiss says.  Computomics was able to grow with the help of stipends and other support to get things off the ground. The company grew by exploring plant breeding as a potential area of focus and establishing a long-term partnership to learn from customers’ needs and improve their product. The team received public funding to support their development and data analysis efforts, which are crucial to bioinformatics due to the large datasets involved.  As the founders worked to build the company, which officially opened its doors in 2012 as a spin-off from the Max Planck Institute for Biology and the University of Tübingen, their technology and expertise attracted major players in the plant breeding and seed industry.  Computomics co-founder Sebastian Schultheiss builds a lightwall in the early days of the company.  In 2016 Computomics introduced their groundbreaking machine learning technology xSeedScore®, which allows seed companies to optimize traits like yield, flavor, texture and shelf life while offering the ability to improve crops and provide supply chain continuity as crops can be adapted for multiple locations and future climates.  “Tübingen remains the heart of Computomics as a company, and the home of its data center. With the experience of more than 180 successfully completed projects for customers in 18 countries, Computomics helps navigate the complexities of all crops,” Schultheiss says.  Their advanced machine learning methods enable rapid understanding of genomic data for researchers including those in the plant breeding and seed spaces, he adds.  The Rise of Artificial Intelligence  Right now, AI is on a lot of people’s minds as chatbots grab headlines all over the world. It’s important to note that AI and Tübingen have been intimately linked for years. The Cyber Valley initiative was launched in 2016, with the aim of advancing research in AI and machine learning, as well as promoting the transfer of knowledge and technology from academia to industry.  Computomics technology is a great example of how AI can be used to benefit all mankind.  The initiative is based on a collaboration between the University of Tübingen, the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, and the University of Stuttgart. “Because Tübingen allows for both professional and personal relationships with colleagues, it’s a prime location for AI researchers and companies to establish themselves”, Huson notes.  This has led to the emergence of many innovative AI companies in the area, with Computomics being one of the first AI companies founded a few years before the establishment of the Cyber Valley.  AI systems can be trained on large datasets to learn patterns and make predictions or decisions based on that data. There are different types, including machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics, and they are being used in a wide range of applications, from virtual assistants and self-driving cars to medical diagnosis, financial forecasting, and in the agricultural space.  When applied to plant breeding, AI can save breeders both time and resources by more precisely identifying the elite genetics to test in the field. AI can capture genetically what would take breeders multiple cycles of selection and large expenditure of resources to achieve.  AI has the capability when applied with discipline and focus to both increase the efficiency and the genetic gain of a breeders pipeline.  The machine learning technology xSeedScore analyzes massive amounts of genomic data, allowing plant breeders to select the best plant traits for desired outcomes such as yield, flavor, texture and shelf life. This technology helps to speed up the plant breeding process by allowing breeders to identify the best genetic combinations for a specific trait and select plants for crossbreeding.  It is a modern use of technology that has been in development in Tübingen for a long time and which will only accelerate as time goes on. Computomics technology is a great example of how AI can be used to benefit all mankind.  —Sebastian Schultheiss and Daniel Huson are pioneers in the field of bioinformatics and co-founders of Computomics."

It would also have to be ensured that the tigers stay inside the core areas and do not move out often,"" Bahekar said.

The Loose Women star, 64, is a proud mum to 1975 frontman Matty Healy, 34, and her younger son, Louis, 22.  The former Coronation Street star has long been open about her battle with her inner demons, but she has now given more insight than ever into how she first dealt with her very first panic attack which came out of nowhere just days after she gave birth to Matty back in 1989.  After enjoying a peaceful and problem-free pregnancy with her first child, things took a turn for the worst for Denise on one random day when everything appeared to build up and emerge in the form of a panic-attack which left the new mum feeling as though she was dying.

Alongside a sweet throwback snap of her and her famous son Matty, Denise penned: ""This is 2 days before Matty was born, April 1989. Happy, excited, nervous. I had a brilliant pregnancy and wasn't even bothered when he was 9 days late.  ""Long labour but he was a healthy 8lbs and we were thrilled with our beautiful boy. I wasn't anxious. I loved the first few days even though he cried a lot.  ""A week later out of nowhere, during a walk with my mum, my life changed forever. After my first-ever panic attack a feeling of unreality came over me and within an hour I was in a thick, black, terrifying depression. I didn't eat for weeks. I was almost catatonic.

Denise went on to further share her experiences with post-natal depression as she penned: "" Post-natal depression robbed me of any joy for months. I felt nothing. The GP was terrible and knew nothing.  ""I tried for 20 years to get someone to listen to me that I felt my illness was hormonal. No one really helped me.  ""Years of good days and bad days followed. Several 'nervous breakdowns' as we called them and every antidepressant known to man, which undoubtedly did help for sure.

He found me to be very severely deficient in oestrogen. My life changed that day. I still live with the 'unwelcome visitor' but he far less visible these days.""  The Loose Women star concluded by urging her followers who may find themselves in the same position as she once was to 'reach out'.  ""We have HRT and it's our right to be given it. Reach out and shout from the rooftops if you have to. Accept any help offered. Don't suffer in silence. With the right help life with your baby will be wonderful,"" she ended the post.

By age 30, fertility, ability to get pregnant, begins to decline.  “This decline happens faster once you reach your mid-30s. By 45, fertility has declined so much that getting pregnant naturally is unlikely, Dr. Mrs. Hanson stated.  She recommended that all things being equal, women should give birth, “not too early or too late as they all have their respective complications.”  “Women should also consider proper spacing children,” she said, and stressed that women should consider giving birth before their 30th birthday.  Dr. Hansen said giving birth at a young age is better; nonetheless, the interval between children was crucial.  Dr. Hanson made the remarks at the weekly “Your Health! Our Collective Responsibility,” a Ghana News Agency Tema Regional Office initiative aimed at promoting health-related communication and providing a platform for health information dissemination to influence personal health choices through improved health literacy.  The Tema Regional Office of the Ghana News Agency launched the public health advocacy platform “Your Health! Our Collective Responsibility” to examine the components of four health communication approaches: informing, instructing, persuading, and promoting.  She suggested that spacing the birth of children between the ages of two and four years is ideal when the body had recovered from the previous delivery and was ready for another.  She said the body reacted to giving birth as if it were the first time after a four-year interval.  The IMaH Medical Officer advised married couples to evaluate their financial and personal circumstances because some women had conditions that required them to limit births due to the high risk of mortality.  Dr. Mrs. Hanson recommended that young people marry early because giving birth early frequently allowed them to achieve the body stature, they desired and live life more fully.  Contributing to the discussion, Mr. Samuel Atuahene Antwi, Nutritionist Officer at Tema Metropolitan Health Directorate, said the reproductive system of women in their younger years produces quality eggs.  He said women’s reproductive lifespan evolved within the menstrual cycle period; nevertheless, the fertility of eggs produced at ages 18 and up was of higher quality than eggs produced at ages 30 and up.  Mr. Antwi also believed that giving birth at a young age was easier than giving birth at an older age when the woman and newborn were more likely to have abnormalities.  According to the Nutritionist, as individuals become older, they lose interest in many things. early parenthood stimulates young couples since they have the energy to take care of their children’s development.

I was referred by the NHS for postnatal depression, but throughout that time no psychological support came through from British Cycling,” she says.  Fachie, who is aiming to make it to the Cycling World Championships in Glasgow alongside husband and fellow Paralympian Neil Fachie this summer, expressed her frustration that British Cycling had not gone beyond the UK Sport guidelines and offered more personal care.  “It’s little things. You’re there to win medals, and if you’re not winning medals you’re just a number. These last few months have been a real reminder that on a personal level they couldn’t care less about you.”  When approached for comment, British Cycling maintained that the wellbeing of their riders is their “number one priority”. British Cycling performance director Stephen Park CBE said: “Our coaching and wider support teams have been working incredibly closely with Lora, and are now supporting her with a collaborative and progressive return to full training.  “Riders are regularly reminded of the additional mental health and medical support available to them if required. We will continue to listen to Lora and others to understand where we can further strengthen the support we offer.”  UK Sport also reiterated their commitment to supporting mothers “both on and off the field of play” in wake of Fachie’s experience, and announced that they will be publishing updated guidelines later this summer.  “The publication of our pregnancy guidance was an important step forward, and so far 13 athletes from 12 sports have been supported through their pregnancy,” said UK Sport CEO Sally Munday. “We are determined to continue to drive forward progress on equality and power a diverse and inclusive Olympic and Paralympic family.”  ‘Women don’t want an advantage, just a chance’  Clarisse Crémer is no stranger to the obstacles faced by athletes after having children. The French sailor, who is the fastest woman to sail solo around the world, was dropped by her sponsor, Banque Populaire, ahead of the 2024 Vendée Globe – a sailing race so tough it has been dubbed ‘the Everest of the seas’ – after giving birth last year. Banque Populaire insisted that sponsoring Crémer was too big a risk after a change in qualification rules for the race put her at a disadvantage due to her time away from sailing.  Crémer believes the underlying issue is that women are seen as incapable of having both a demanding career and a child. “Becoming a mother is not a disease, it's not a wound,” she laughs. “There's a lot of work to be done on the perception of what it is to have a baby and to have ambitious careers as well. For some people it’s quite normal that a woman has to choose [between the two], and that has to improve."

(Photo: JIS)  KINGSTON, Jamaica – Visually impaired Jamaicans who apply for a birth certificate will soon be receiving the document printed in Braille, according to Floyd Green, minister without portfolio in the Office of the Prime Minister.  Green made the announcement on Tuesday during his contribution to the 2023/24 Sectoral Debate in the House of Representatives.  He said the Registrar General’s Department (RGD) is moving to make this a reality soon.  “I have continued to advocate for and ensure the inclusion of our most vulnerable in all that we do. In order to satisfy our visually impaired customers, we will be embarking on printing birth certificates in Braille. This is to be executed through partnerships with Jamaica Council for Persons with Disabilities, Jamaica Society for the Blind and other relevant stakeholders,” Green said.  “This is a pioneering effort within the English-speaking Caribbean,” he added.  Meanwhile, Green updated the House on the Government's Operation BirthRight programme which is aimed at providing up to 30,000 undocumented, minimum wage-earning Jamaicans with a birth certificate. He said over 2,000 applicants have so far submitted applications for birth certificates under the programme.  “We have also partnered with the Department of Correctional Services to provide close to 100 birth certificates for inmates at the St Catherine Adult Correctional Centre; a programme which will extend over the next coming months to other correctional centres islandwide,” Green said.  He noted that determining whether the applicants are eligible for Jamaican birth certificates is an involved process and, in some cases, consists of obtaining information from applicants’ schools, churches and communities.  Green said the RGD conducting fieldwork and follow-ups to advance the late registration and entries required to issue birth certificates to eligible applicants. He also disclosed that an additional 14 people have been employed across the island to treat specifically with Operation Birthright.  The minister anticipates that the production of birth certificates will be ramped up this year.  “Last month we started a promotional campaign and will continue that drive for the next few months. The government is imploring Jamaicans to use this programme to gain the much anticipated benefits,” he said."

Loading the player...  CNN’s René Marsh has a new source of hope in her life.  Two years after the death of her 2-year-old son Blake to brain cancer, the CNN national correspondent has given birth to a baby girl. Marsh told People magazine her daughter Siena, born last month, “has, and forever will, serve as a reminder of hope.”  “I felt happy to be able to have this chance again to be a mom again,” said the journalist. “And it was finally happening for us, the fact that I was pregnant again gave me hope. It gave me something to look forward to that was positive. This pregnancy really renewed my spirit of hope.”  René Marsh appears on CNN’s “New Day.” (Photo credit: CNN screenshot)  Marsh was still deeply grieving the loss of her son while pregnant, experiencing a “constant tug and pull” between a mix of emotions. Her daughter’s movement in the womb particularly impacted her.  “Through the tears, her gentle and sometimes not-so-gentle kicks in the womb reminded me more was on the horizon,” Marsh explained. “I will tell her one day how her kicks gave me hope at a time of great heartbreak.”  The tears returned the day Siena was born; reflecting on the magnitude of pushing through her grief to make it to motherhood for a second time, Marsh said she felt accomplished.  “I think that’s where the tears were coming from, and there were tears of relief, there were tears of happiness, but there were also tears of reflection of just all the battered, bruised journey that I had taken to get to this point,” she said.  Marsh is using self-reflection to continue her healing process.  “It’s important to take a self-assessment of what you have been able to endure so far, even if you’re still enduring it, and give yourself a pat on the back, that reflection is important,” she said.  Marsh also intends to keep mothering both of her children, saying parenting daughter Siena will be “traditional” since she has her in the physical sense, but she will also continue to “mother” Blake through her work and activism. She recently partnered with the Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation and has released a children’s book in Blake’s honor, with 100% of the proceeds benefitting pediatric brain cancer research.  “I’ll never get over the loss of my son,” Marsh said. “But now I have the love of my daughter to at least give me the balance that I was lacking before she got here.”  TheGrio is FREE on your TV via Apple TV, Amazon Fire, Roku, and Android TV.

In an interview with TVBS News Network, Wang said he was by his wife’s side during the delivery and even helped cut the umbilical cord.  The 40-year-old also revealed that he had asked a hospital staff member to pack the umbilical cord and placenta, so he could refrigerate it and cook it at home for his wife.  Wang said he made the decision after hearing that consuming the placenta can provide important micronutrients such as iron, increase milk production and beautify one’s face.  On Sunday (May 14), the Intern Doctor star posted an Instagram Reel demonstrating how he cooked the dish.  In the video, Wang can be seen boiling the placenta and umbilical cord in a pot before frying them them with onions, ginger and pepper.  “This is my first time eating human flesh. I was initially very nervous when I took my first bite.  “It tastes a little like pork liver but also pork belly and intestines. The taste is pretty average,” he told TVBS News Network.  Meanwhile, Cindy said she enjoyed the dish and that the placenta was “delicious and crunchy”.  Placenta eating has been a popular trend worldwide, with many celebrities encapsulating, blending and cooking their placenta for rumoured health benefits.  Among the big names who ate their placenta include Kim Kardashian, Chrissy Teigen, Alicia Silverstone and Hilary Duff.  Despite the trend, experts at Mayo Clinic – a nonprofit organisation committed to clinical practice, education and research – say there’s no evidence that eating the placenta provides health benefits.  Last December, registered dietitian and founder of Dietitian Fit & Co Karine Patel told Reader’s Digest that ingesting placenta increases the risk of group B Streptococcus infection.  “This can be a serious and sometimes fatal infection for both the mother and baby. Even if the placenta is cooked, it doesn’t completely destroy infectious bacteria and viruses that the placenta may have.  “A mother who got infected by the group B streptococcus infection after consuming infected placenta pills passed on the infection to her newborn by breastfeeding the baby,” she said.  In 2017, the Centers For Disease Control And Prevention (CDC) issued a warning against placenta ingestion following a case in which a newborn developed group B streptococcus after the mother took contaminated placenta pills."

My guest today is Hugo Hopenhayn, an economist at UCLA and long-term consultant with the Richmond Fed's Research department. Hugo, welcome to the show.  Hugo Hopenhayn: Thank you. It's a pleasure to be here.  Sablik: We're recording this episode in March 2023, and I'm excited to talk to you about some of your research in the areas of innovation and firm dynamics, as well as about a conference you're organizing here at Richmond in May on innovation.  Most people who have had some exposure to economics have probably heard of ""creative destruction,"" a term typically attributed to Austrian-born economist Joseph Schumpeter. It refers to the process by which old, inefficient businesses fail and are replaced by newer, more productive firms. This process is considered a cornerstone of capitalism, but I suspect that most people don't give it a lot of daily thought.  You've spent much of your career as an economist studying firm dynamics — this process of firms entering and exiting the market. Why are you so interested in it?  Hopenhayn: As social scientists, we see facts and we want to think of what might be explaining these facts. Firms are born. Some of them die very young. Some of them survive, grow over time [and] eventually die. There is this process in which there's survival and death.  The process of firm creation and destruction, and the process of firm growth and shrinkage, involves the reallocation of resources — a very large reallocation of resources. Labor is reallocated from shrinking firms to growing firms, from exiting firms to firms that are newly created. Capital is relocated, too — the order of magnitude of this capital relocation is perhaps as large as the creation of new capital.  So, is this reallocation good? Does it contribute to the well functioning of the economy? Well, that's part of what the Schumpeterians had in mind — that behind this process of creative destruction is somewhat of a process of natural selection, where this job reallocation will reallocate talent and resources from less to more valuable activities.  Sablik: Mm-hmm.  Hopenhayn: It's this process of reallocation that makes the economy good and function well and be able to progress. So, that's the economic reason for thinking about this.  In terms of the creation and destruction mechanisms, you can think, well, why are some firms not able to survive? Why are some firms not able to grow? There might be many reasons behind this.  One reason might be that firms are not able to keep up with progress. As the world is changing, as new technologies appear [and] as new needs appear, firms might not be able to adapt. Firms that are not able to adapt to the new environment are likely to not succeed and exit.  The other reason might be the displacement by new firms. This is something I think was central to the idea of creative destruction. New firms, in some ways, are displacing existing firms.  The specific way in which this creative destruction takes place is important. If you're creating a completely new activity, that might not displace directly any resources from other firms. But at the end of the day, you need resources. If you're creating a new activity, you're going to need workers, you're going to need equipment and so on. Indirectly that is going to be competing for resources with other firms. At the other extreme, a firm may come and basically displace completely one other firm that was the leading firm in that particular activity. By doing that, it's adding some new value. But at the same time, there's another force which is taking away value from the firm that exits.  While these resource reallocations might be good from the efficiency point of view, not everything is perfect. There might be reasons why creative destruction might generate some sources of inefficiencies. Even though it might contribute to this reallocation, it might do it [while] burning some value that was created by other firms. The anticipation of that burning of value might affect those firms in decisions to innovate to begin with.  Sablik: Right. As you mentioned, this reallocation process can be a bit messy sometimes. It can be particularly painful for workers at firms that fail and lose their jobs. A number of countries have adopted policies to help with that transition process, to help protect workers who lose their jobs through no fault of their own.  A 1993 paper that you wrote with Richard Rogerson in the Journal of Political Economy explored this issue of how interfering with the job destruction process can have an impact on the overall efficiency of the labor market. Can you talk a bit more about those findings of that paper and the legacy of that work today?  Hopenhayn: Sure. Just to focus on that particular kind of policy, this is like a tax on firing. A tax on firing one might think protects the workers that are currently in been in the firm. And that is right in some ways. But one has to understand that a tax on firing has implications for hiring. In anticipation of the fact that if you were to downsize in the future you're going to have to pay these taxes, firms are going to hire less.  Beyond that, there is the impact that these policies have on overall productivity. Presumably, if the reallocation of resources is healthy, it's going to be a reallocation that goes from less to more productive or less or more valuable activities. So, taxing reallocation is somehow curtailing the efficiency of this movement of resources. As a consequence, it's going to slow down progress. It's going to reduce the overall productivity in the economy.  Sablik: Mm-hmm.  Hopenhayn: Now, the question of protecting workers is a serious one, especially in the event of large displacements that could happen because there are big reforms — lowering tariff barriers, privatizations and so on — which are very common in less developed countries. This could lead to very large employment losses. The question is what is the best mechanism to cope with that. In this process of creative destruction, there [are] winners and losers and there are people that can lose a lot. We would like to be able to provide some kind of protection and insurance.  Unemployment insurance is an institution that is fairly common in more developed economies, but it's less prevalent in less developed economies. I'm an advocate of those kinds of policies, properly designed. It's understood that unemployment insurance could also generate some distortions.  Sablik: In recent years, there's also been some growing concern about an overall slowdown in business dynamics. Firm entry and exit rates have been falling since the 1970s. This is something that you've also been looking into and researching, particularly looking at how [business dynamics] connects to demographics. What did you find in that research?  Hopenhayn: These demographic changes in the U.S. economy have been tremendous. Around the mid-'70s, the labor force was growing at a rate of 2.5 percent per year. Nowadays, it's growing at 0.5 percent. It's hard to understand what are the implications of these changes. There's lots of research that is concerned with this.  When we think about firm creation, when a firm creates, it's going to need to take its resources from somewhere. Part of where it takes them is from existing firms. But also new resources are added constantly to the economy in terms of labor, which is one of the most important resources, by the introduction [of workers] or the growth in the labor force — basically, new people entering the labor force.  If there's a slowdown in the growth of the labor force, there's a slowdown in these resources that are made available for the creation of new firms and for the expansion of existing firms. What we see in the data is that the incentives for firm creation are affected negatively by this decrease in the rate of growth of [the] labor force. So these demographic forces have a first impact — less people are born, less firms are born.  Another side of the story is that firms are going to be created and firms are going to expand if demand grows. Part of the growth in demand is the increase in population. If population increase is slowing down, then that contribution of that additional source of demand growth is diminished.  In the same way that we think about populations having demographics and populations aging, firms also have demographics. So, in any population where births are going down, that population will age. In the same way that the population of people is aging, the population of firms is also aging. What implications does this have [for] questions such as the extent of reallocation, perhaps innovation? What implications does this have on concentration?  What our paper tried to do is try to account [for] how much of the rise in average firm size, how much of the decrease in entry rates, how much of the decrease in exit rates — the turnover of firms — [and] how much of the decrease in reallocation between shrinking and expanding firms is affected by these demographic forces. We find that it's a very large fraction.  In terms of the implications for the economy, it's unclear. If you think that [firm] entry is contributing to growth by bringing in new ideas and so on, that might be worrisome. Perhaps part of the slowdown in productivity has to do with this. But all of these trends are not showing that the economy is not working well. No, the economy is responding in a natural way to the changes in demographics.  Sablik: Yeah. As you mentioned, the creation and destruction of firms matters a lot for the overall productivity of the economy, and the productivity of individual firms matters for the aggregate. You've explored how frictions like the misallocation of resources also influences productivity. Can you talk about your findings and how they help improve our understanding of the drivers of economic growth?  Hopenhayn: These issues that you're talking about are of the most concern with less developed economies. There is a very important question in economics, which is trying to understand the big disparities that we see in income per capita across countries in the world — much larger than the disparities that we see within developed countries.  One of the leading explanations of this is the aggregate level of productivity of less developed countries is the principal driver. Obviously, there are differences in their human capital and also their physical capital. Their resources are not the same. But it's not only the resources. [It's] how these resources are put together that make these economies much less productive. And so, creative destruction and the reallocation of resources to their most productive uses, in some ways, will determine the productivity of an economy beyond the resources it has.  One of the prevailing views of explaining under development is that these distortions might be much more important in some less developed countries. There are many policies that affect this. One I referred to before was these labor firing taxes. But any distortions that are affecting this process of reallocation will definitely have consequences over productivity.  There [are] other policies that are quite common. The cost of creating a business differs a lot across countries. If you have very high costs of creating business, you're taxing the creation of firms, which will also lead to less destruction of firms. But that reduction of the creation and destruction of firms will reduce the reallocation which is, in principle, a healthy reallocation and as a consequence will have effects on aggregate productivity.  There [are] also incentives for innovation. If resources are not well allocated, that might increase the cost of innovation. Firms below a certain size in many countries, including France, are exempt from some labor taxes.  Or, in less developed countries — perhaps because of the high cost of creating firms — there are many [of] what [are] called informal firms, which are firms that don't comply with any of the regulations and are not paying any of these taxes. The more successful firms, which are the formal firms, are paying these taxes [and] the other ones are not.  You might think that some of this should exist in order to promote a fair economy. They do have a cost in the sense that they there are a tax on being successful. If you have a tax on being successful, that's going to also decrease the incentives to be successful. That decrease in the incentives might imply that firms are more reluctant to invest in innovation and in activities that enhance value. As you reduce the value of firms, you're going to reduce the aggregate productivity.  Sablik: Yeah. Thinking about policies that are designed to encourage innovation at firms, I mentioned at the beginning of the conversation you're organizing this conference at Richmond in May about innovation. What are you hoping to learn there? What are the big questions in this space that economists are researching?  Hopenhayn: I would say the conference is really not only about innovation. It's more about the intersection of networks, innovation and productivity growth.  Lots of papers are exploring the role of inter-firm linkages for productivity. This can happen in different ways. For example, trade economists are interested in the fact that lowering barriers to trade, lowering tariffs, allows firms to search among a larger set of potential providers of inputs.  Another form of interconnection, which is not necessarily between firms that are [in] a supplier-buyer relationship, is between firms in the idea space. When a start-up is thinking about a new idea, a lot of the thinking about a new source of value is inspired by opportunities that it sees from existing technologies or advances in technology. Innovation breeds innovation. There [are] these feedbacks and these linkages that we are interested in understanding better.  One of the forces that is behind growth is not just knowledge creation, but also knowledge diffusion. How does this knowledge diffuse? It diffuses by perhaps observing others that are acquiring and changing their practices. This is something that carries through the rest of the economy. Part of the selection of papers at this conference is also trying to give some light on this.  Sablik: Sticking with the theme of innovation, this conference is part of the Richmond Fed's CORE Week model, which is an innovation that the Research department here adopted after the pandemic as a way to bring economists together, originally virtually and now in person, for seminars and conferences.  You've been quite involved and have attended several CORE Weeks. What do you find valuable about that process?  Hopenhayn: Let me first start [by] saying that the process that is going on here is not unique. It's perhaps quite unique compared to other Federal Reserve Banks.  At UCLA, for instance, every area used to have their seminar. You invite somebody, you hang out with them, maybe some students also hang out with them. And it's a whole day — you go to dinner at night — so there's a lot of informal information exchange plus the paper they present.  A lot [of economists] have been saying instead of doing that you do, monthly, a mini conference where you bring four people and you have a whole day. During that day, you have these presentations of the same length of time that you would have had if people would come every week, but you're concentrating them in one day. So, it's similar to what's happening [during] CORE Weeks.  CORE Weeks concentrate both researchers from inside the Richmond Fed [and] researchers that come from outside — visitors, speakers. It's a critical mass, a very large critical mass. Rather than having these activities distributed evenly over time, you have these weeks where you get this large scale effect. Obviously, this is exploiting, in some ways, economies of scale in knowledge, knowledge creation in the future, right, as we were talking about before.  When I go to a seminar, I learn from the speaker. But you learn almost as much from the questions that are being asked from the people that are there. People are highly energized — speakers sometime start laughing because they get so many questions that they think they're not going to be able to finish.  Sablik: Hugo, thank you so much for coming on to talk with me today.  Hopenhayn: I appreciate the opportunity.  Sablik: I'll remind listeners, as always, that you can head over to the show page for links to Hugo's papers that we discussed today.

Content creator Bramty Juliette revealed that she wanted her husband and her mom around when she was welcoming her firstborn into this world. However, things didn’t go quite according to plan. The woman opened up about her experience on a podcast she co-hosts with her husband, the snippet of which was later uploaded on her TikTok account. Scroll down to find the video below.  In their viral video, content creator Bramty Juliette discussed her first childbirth experience with her husband  Image credits: nd3000  “The reason why I really didn’t like your mom back then”  Image credits: bramty  “I was giving birth to Penelope and I let his mom be in the room to watch me give birth, which was also a huge issue. ‘I don’t want your mom in the room. I only want you. I only want you and my mom in the room, you’re my husband, and my mom for emotional support.’ And he’s said, ‘I want my mom in the room.'”  “No, it’s not about you. It’s my mom, like, I want her in the room”  Image credits: bramty  “‘No, it’s not about you.’ And he didn’t really understand. She’s the one giving birth. And that wasn’t the case”  “When you give birth, it’s about the wife. She’s the one going through things physically, mentally”  Image credits: bramty  “At the moment, like my water breaks, I go to the hospital and it’s my first time giving birth. I’m 19 years old. I’m having contractions. I remember having contractions. And I was like, I’m gonna do birth without an epidural. So I try to push it through as long as I could. And at the time, I was just so focused on, my contractions.”  “We had my mom, you, your mom, your brother, and your aunt who I never spoke to in my whole life in the room, watching my birth”  Image credits: bramty  “Interviewer: ‘Cause it’s Cuban people. They just want to be, involved and think everything’s fine. Nothing’s taboo, everything’s fine.’  He should have had my back then. You should have had my back then. ‘All right, Bramty, you’re about to give birth. Everybody out. Only what my wife wants.’ But you didn’t have that mentality and you just had your mom’s back most of the time. So I remember I just wasn’t even involved with, who was in the room. I remember pushing.”  “I remember your mom and your aunt taking pictures of my vagina while I am pushing, then later finding out that your aunt had sent those pictures to family members”  Bramty’s TikTok video attracted over five million views  Having loved ones around during childbirth can make it a more positive experience  Image credits: Jonathan Borba (not the actual photo)  Bramty shared her story of giving birth on the newly-released BRAMTEA podcast that she hosts together with her husband Luis Espina. Previously known from their YouTube channel, titled The Bramfam, the couple discussed how—as Bramty stated in her video description—her mother-in-law ruined her childbirth experience.  The woman said she wanted her husband and her mother to be there in the room with her, which is not an unusual request. The World Health Organization (WHO) emphasized that support coming from the people the expectant mother trusts can help make labor and childbirth a more positive experience. The loved ones can aid her in numerous ways, including facilitating communication between the staff and the mom-to-be, providing practical and emotional support, and assisting with non-pharmacological pain relief methods, among other things.  Having a trustworthy person around can indeed help reduce discomfort, as research shows that there’s a positive correlation between a spouse’s participation in childbirth and pain relief. Moreover, the study pointed out that their presence is beneficial not only for the mother herself, but also for their partner, which is why the majority of spouses say they would participate in subsequent births as well.  Nowadays, quite a few dads are present during the birth of their child but that wasn’t always the case  Image credits: Craig Adderley (not the actual photo)  Positive effects of having a partner present during childbirth might be one of the reasons quite a few expectant mothers want them by their side during such a significant moment. Some research suggests that as much as 85% of women say they would like their husband to be there.  NPR pointed out that even though nowadays seeing fathers in the delivery room is quite common, it wasn’t as usual back in the day. Medical historian Judy Leavitt told NPR that traditionally giving birth was mostly a female event. Even when the births moved from home to the hospital in the 20th century, husbands would typically remain in the waiting rooms. According to the historian, fathers started staying around for the birth of their babies roughly in the ‘70s and ‘80s.  A 2016 study of the birth experience from the perspective of the fathers revealed that their attendance in childbirth had a positive effect on all of the main parties involved—the mother, the newborn, and the dads themselves. According to the study, as much as 94% of them were happy to be present for such an event. However, they admitted to feeling some extent of helplessness and fear as well, in addition being somewhat overwhelmed by the event.  Considering the benefits of having your partner by your side while giving birth, it’s understandable why Bramty wanted her husband around. She also wanted her mother to be there, who is arguably a person she trusts; and according to the World Health Organization, compassion and trustworthiness are two of the main characteristics that pregnant women seek in their companions during childbirth. The content creator might have not felt the same level of connection with her husband’s family. In addition to that, she didn’t appreciate some of their actions, which seemingly shocked quite a few people in the comments as well.  The online community had plenty to say about the situation  Some people shared stories about similar personal experiences"

According to the latest data, Cyprus has a fertility rate of just 1.3 children per woman – the 14th lowest in the world.  Data from the interior ministry showed 500 fewer babies were born in 2022 than the preceding year–a total of 7,316 children compared with 7,867 in 2021, SigmaLive reported.  Some have speculated that the pandemic quarantine nudged many couples to take the leap into parenthood or have another child.  A breakdown of the 2022 numbers shows most mothers had their first or second child (3,510 and 2,751 respectively). The numbers drop steeply for those having their third child (790) and even further for those having their fourth (177). Mothers having their fifth child was down to double digits (25) while eight had their sixth, three their seventh, two their eighth and one mother had her ninth child.  The data obtained concerned only Greek Cypriot mothers.  The health ministry on Wednesday meanwhile promoted legislation to increase subsidies for infertility treatments and make them easier to obtain.  Health Minister Popi Kanari, speaking on Tuesday night at an event on the topic, said the subsidies will include storage of eggs by women aiming to preserve their fertility over time.  Success rates for infertility procedures, however, decline steeply depending on the cause of the infertility, as well as with age, and treatments are not without risk.  In 2019, the UKs NIH reported the percentage of IVF treatments resulting in live births to be just shy of one third (32 per cent) for women in the youngest category, that is, under 35. Success rates plummeted to 25 per cent for women aged up to 37, with a continuing drop reaching to merely 4 to 5 per cent for women aged 43 and over.  Early family planning thus looms large as a critical piece of the puzzle and needs to be addressed in any policy-driven efforts to raise the country’s birth rate.  The health minister noted that the average Cypriot woman currently gives birth to her first child at the age of 32. Women should be encouraged to begin planning a family as early as possible, the minister said, since even natural fertility decreases noticeably after the age of 35.  Among other proposed actions are awareness-raising and management of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), which if not treated promptly, increase infertility, especially for women.  Moreover, it is important to know that having children later in life may add physical, psychological and financial stressors, particularly for those embarking on the journey to parenthood via assisted reproduction, the minister said."

Gov. Ron DeSantis signed legislation (HB 1521) that will require restrooms to be segregated by gender in public buildings. The new law also will make it a crime to use the restroom not matching a person’s sex at birth.  The Republican Governor said the bill would ensure “women’s safety” in the state of Florida. He noted the bill will apply in corrections institutes, including juvenile ones, and at public schools.  “A woman should not be in a locker room having to worry about someone from the opposite sex being in their locker room, and it’s happening with athletics, with our girl athletes and women athletes,” DeSantis said.  “Also with some of these other things, whether it’s a prison situation, whether it’s just these restrooms, you know, we want to make sure that our roles and our women are protected. And so this bill does that and makes sure that they’re not going to be exposed to situations that are not in their best interest.”  The law will go into effect on July 1.  Immediately, the bill and several others signed the same day but DeSantis drew a rebuke from LGBTQ activists.  “The simple act of being able to go to the bathroom has been taken away from our kids,” said Jennifer Solomon, president of PFLAG South Miami. “As parents in this state, we are not being respected and our children aren’t being respected.”  The measure was among several signed Wednesday that will disproportionately impact transgender Floridians.  During the Legislative Session, lawmakers passed Senate language limiting restrictions to public facilities, and not imposing regulations on private retailers. Lawmakers behind the bill characterized the new law as “common sense.”  “There’s not anything in the language of this bill that is targeting any specific group,” said Sen. Erin Grall, a Vero Beach Republican, on the Senate floor. “Rather it speaks to the differences that we have as different sexes as male and female.”  Rep. Rachel Plakon suggested this simply puts a framework in state law that has been in effect practically for more than a century.  “We’ve had a huge scientific study with billions of people for 136 years that separate facilities work,” she said.  But LGBTQ activists and sympathetic lawmakers said the bathroom restrictions represent gross overreach.  Rep. Kelly Skidmore, a Boca Raton Democrat, suggested the bill will ultimately prove unenforceable, especially as it doesn’t even exclude transgender people who have fully transitioned.  “My sister’s boyfriend is a trans man. He is a full blown man and you want him to walk into the girls room,” she said. “Do you understand? And then you want someone to go in there and tell him that he’s in the wrong bathroom. But it’s the bathroom you’re sending him to. You have no idea what you are doing here.”  Enforcement will be dependent on whatever agencies oversee the public facility in question in the event individuals use a bathroom they are not entitled to enter."

Beautifully shot on 16mm, Theodore Schaefer‘s directorial debut (available to stream today) follows Diana (Annie Parisse), a frustrated wife and mother, who finds her identity has been stolen by internet fraudsters unknown, in the midst of a crisis of confidence for her entire family. Her husband, Daryl (Paul Sparks) wants to be a chef but finds himself stuck in a dead-end job at a burger place, wearing someone else’s apron as he makes a change.  His children call him chef as they pass take-out back and forth. Their son, Drew (Owen Campbell), is really named Andrew, but Daryl insists the family only use names that start with D. Drew has agreed to be the father to his pregnant girlfriend’s child by someone else, taking on the role eagerly, lacking an identity of his own. His girlfriend, Marlene (Gus Birney), lives in her delusional mother’s shadow, her pregnancy unacknowledged, her presence largely ignored. In the face of Diana’s sudden destitution, she and Marlene embark on a secret road trip to track down the thieves and get Diana’s money back, to strange and unexpected results. Each individual character is well drawn, and the film’s first act in particular presents an intriguing set up for a mystery of both cosmic and quotidian proportions. Yet, while there is potential for poignancy in this (overtly) Homeric and surreal journey for self-acceptance, as it progresses, like its titular butterflies, the film ultimately gets lost in the breeze.  Ghosts  Giving Birth to a Butterfly is a story about the ties that bind us, to each other as well as to reality itself. The responsibilities of children, family, and adulthood drag at these characters as they drift through life delivering poetic monologues back and forth, unheard and overlooked. Diana and Daryl (real-life spouses) seem to have nothing in common anymore, never communicating directly as they save up for Daryl’s restaurant and process their son’s unorthodox relationship. They communicate around each other through strained silences and the occasional insult. For Diana, their marriage has come to represent compromise in a life already full of them.  At work, a young boy asks her to sell him a single condom from a pack (“do they come in different sizes?” he asks hopefully. “Why don’t you start with these…” she replies, handing him a generic box). He doesn’t have the money, and she offers to cover them herself, in one of the seemingly endless concessions she’s made to men at this juncture of her life. When her credit card gets declined, we learn that her one attempt to do something that isn’t for Daryl has backfired and she’s lost their shared savings. Her reason: She wanted to make some money for her daughter, Danielle (Rachel Resheff), a phantom of a character who’s working as a technician at the community theater during a production fittingly called “Ghost,” shining a light on others and, like Diana, leaving little space for herself.  Even on stage, actors revoke their own identities (through stage names, through their roles, etc.) and lose their sense of self. Marlene’s mother (and Birney‘s real-life mother, Constance Shulman), channels Norma Desmond and Blanche DuBois as she stalks through her home in thrift gowns, giving “tell-all” interviews to invisible reporters: “It’s about time I tell my story!” She is never addressed by her first name, Monica, usually reduced to her more mundane role as Marlene’s mother even as she tries to adopt a stage name no one will ever hear for her nonexistent stage roles. Marlene suggests they name the baby after her at one point: “What about Monica? My mother’s not using it.” “Sometimes I think about getting a name change,” Diana grimly tells Marlene at one point on their trip. Motherhood, like marriage, isn’t easy.  Conclusion  Each performer gamely attempts to flesh out these spectral characters, but weighty dialogue bogs them down. Tragically, the intentionally on-the-nose dialogue of “Ghost,” the play Danielle is lighting, shares an uncomfortable similarity to the dialogue the leads deliver in reams. Cryptic, Lynchian monologues can be intriguing, but quickly lose their appeal when it becomes apparent that there is little else propelling the narrative. The mysteries at the film’s heart have more potential than payoff.  Nevertheless, the film is undeniably creative and dreamlike, with moments of winning, artful surrealism, largely created through the use of dissolves and striking imagery (aquariums are a constant presence, seeming to witness the film like a Greek chorus presided over by a tropical fish named Homer – though Drew insists it’s Homer for Simpson). The Alice in Wonderland air Schaefer aims to lend the material is engaging, coming through in flashes that could have been aided by a greater variety of scenarios and concepts. At one point, Monica tells Diana never to say, “good luck,” only “break a leg.” Here’s wishing Schaefer the same for his next film.  Giving Birth to a Butterfly is playing in select theaters and is available to stream as of May 16th."

Learn More  Asteroid City: Scarlett Johansson Started Filming Just 8 Weeks After Giving Birth  Any talented actor can tell you that creating onscreen magic is sometimes akin to giving birth. And for some actors, those experiences can arrive close together.  In Scarlett Johansson's case, her son and filming for her latest role — that of fictional Hollywood star Midge Campbell in the Wes Anderson sci-fi comedy ""Asteroid City"" — arrived within weeks of one another. The actress told Entertainment Weekly in May 2023 that she started filming eight weeks after giving birth to Cosmo Joost. Having agreed to appear in the film during the COVID-19 quarantine and done a lot of work sculpting Midge into a full-blooded being with Anderson, she wasn't ready to cede the role when she discovered that she was pregnant as the film headed into production. Johansson resultantly helped Anderson shoot around any delays her pregnancy might impose on the production.  Anderson started by taking Johansson's close-ups first, then later filming two-shots, group shots, and wide shots featuring her character. It turns out that she also had a little on-set help from one of her co-stars, who was more than happy to offer her a friendly shoulder while she got her post-delivery bearings and tried to keep her focus while filming."

Her beloved daughter survived one challenge after another. Now they're enjoying every moment with this miracle baby. Madelyn Mire was born weighing only one pound, four ounces. The frightening journey began when her mother, Jennilee, was 20 weeks pregnant.  ""Everything was going really well until then! I almost skipped that appointment, so there are a whole lot of miracles surrounding that, but I found out my cervix was 100% effaced,"" explains Jennilee. That's considered a medical emergency and could have forced Jennilee into labor at any moment, so doctors performed a procedure to try to delay it.  At that point, Jennilee was told she had to get to 24-week pregnancy, or her baby wouldn't survive. They had already been through so much. ""Our previous daughter was born at 26 weeks, she actually passed away. And so, we this was our rainbow baby and here we are, going through this again,"" explains Jennilee.  LUNCH FOR THE SOUL: Father of 7 discusses recovery from traumatic brain injury  They transferred to a hospital in the Texas Medical Center with a Level 4 Neo-natal Intensive Care Unit, equipped and staffed to help dangerously ill or premature newborns. Tiny Madelyn was born at 23 weeks and two days and the courageous feats to save her life began. She and her mom had the same infection.  ""She had contracted E. coli, which was her most immediate danger at the time. It crossed the blood-brain barrier, because when they're that small, they don't really have one, and it became meningitis. She also had a brain bleed and cysts on her brain. She had respiratory distress syndrome, which most of the preemies do, but she was on a ventilator for that. She had a heart PDA, which is an issue that they have when born preterm. And then of course they're always worried about their eyes and are hearing when they're that small,"" states Jennilee.  Jennilee went into action beyond medicine to save her newborn. ""I went in ready for battle, spiritual battle and I just started praying and casting death off of her, pleading the blood of Jesus over her. I had actually been introduced to a ministry called The Supernatural Life and had some spiritual deliverance in my life, and it really opened my eyes to the fact that we're in a spiritual battle. In Mark 16: 17-18, it says that the signs shall follow those who believe and at the end of that, it says they shall lay hands on the stick, and they will be healed and I knew that I had seen healings right in front of my eyes,"" says Jennilee.

The doctor stopped me and said, 'we don't know what happened, but it's not there and there's no sign of the necrotizing whatever it's called, the brain is not dying, and we don't see the meningitis.' I almost collapsed, and the doctor caught me and told me to keep praying,"" she added.  From that day on, Jennilee says little Madelyn began to thrive. ""The brain bleeds stopped, and it started drying up, the cysts started shriveling up, and her heart PDA closed in time,"" says Jennilee.

""We have come so far! At first, it's just it's a lot of feelings of helplessness and not knowing what to expect. We went through this before, and when it was happening again, it was hard not to think the worst up front with Jennilee going into labor again,"" said Madelyn’s dad and Jennilee’s husband, Jacob. ""All I could do was just get into reaction mode. Just basically be there for support and continue to pray. It really does bring out the most in faith, just sitting there praying, hoping for the best, and relying on God.""  Madelyn is now a healthy and happy 1-year-old, but it was challenging when they brought her home at 37 weeks gestational age. ""We needed to make sure her environment is just as well as the NICU and just watching every little heartbeat we put have the heartbeat monitor on her and just kind of sit there and watch it on our phones and we just, we stayed up I would say more than a normal parent just because she was so precious to us from all she has been through. She's got every, all the attributes of a normal kid. She's perfect in every way and God is good. He has blessed us. He's showing us miracles through her, and we continue to see them each and every day,"" says Jacob.

Her discharge papers actually say miracle, they actually say that her stay was miraculous. Every doctor that we talked to said that's a miracle. It's a miracle that happened to her that she recovered that she's a 23 weaker and there's nothing wrong with her. She's perfect. She doesn't have any delays. No health effects, no cerebral palsy. Just nothing and her eyes are perfect. She's unreal,"" says a smiling Jennilee.  The Mire's believe a natural approach helped in Madelyn's healing as well, they didn't allow vaccinations when she was only two pounds, and her dad was her blood donor. They also want families to realize we have two centers in Houston known for saving micro-preemies, like Madelyn. If they hadn't found out to transfer hospitals, it's unlikely Madelyn would've survived.  For more information about extremely premature birth, click here."

(KXNET) — A woman who says she was forced to vacate her government-financed Mandan townhome following the birth of her fifth child has now settled the suit.  Shukri Ahmed and High Plains Fair Housing Center filed the suit against Affordable Housing Developers, Inc. in June 2021, after Ahmed says she was forced to vacate Trails West Townhomes following the birth of her fifth child. Ahmed and High Plains Fair Housing Center argued that the decision not to renew Ahmed’s lease was discriminatory. They said the decision violated state and federal law, and that Ahmed was being discriminated against because of her familial status. Affordable Housing Developers responded that Ahmed’s family exceeded their occupancy limits with one adult and five children living in the unit.  Mandan woman claims she was kicked out of townhome for having too many children  As part of the settlement agreement, Affordable Housing Developers will pay $100,000 to Ahmed and High Plains Fair Housing Center, while maintaining the organization did not engage in discriminatory housing practices. The agreement also states that Affordable Housing Developers will implement a revised occupancy policy at its rental properties, and further stipulates that information about fair housing be distributed to tenants, with a fair housing poster to be displayed at each apartment complex it owns or operates.  A news release issued by High Plains Fair Housing Center states that Ahmed “had never been late on rent or incurred a lease violation in the previous 4 years of her tenancy at the property. She was a nurse in the community and paid the full market rental rate. All of the children in the household were under the age of 10 and were not in violation of city code occupancy standards for the 3-bedroom, 1,572 square foot townhome.”  The news release also stated that when the only other available housing Ahmed could find required her to make more money, she accepted a job as a traveling nurse in Fargo to earn the necessary income. However, the new landlord required her to provide two to three months worth of paystubs before moving in — and she only had 30 days to vacate her unit at Trails West Townhomes. Facing homelessness, the release notes that Ahmed “had no choice but to uproot her family and move out of the area, causing immeasurable damages to her and her young children.”  The executive director for High Plains Fair Housing Center, Michelle Rydz, noted in the news release that “strict and numerical occupancy standards applied to families with children under the age of 18 exclude large families from available housing. Evicting, non-renewing, or excluding families due to the birth of a child means those families lose access to their communities, jobs, good schools, and places of worship, and is against the law.”  KX News reached out to the executive director of Affordable Housing Developers for comment. We have not yet heard back."

In addition to these findings, the reports recorded a net-gain in population to rural parts of the commonwealth through in-migration.  The reports, released by the Center for Rural Pennsylvania, a state legislative agency for rural policy, use data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Health, to better understand the commonwealth’s rural areas, including who is moving into — and out — of them.  In-Migration/Out-Migration  Data from the U.S. Census Bureau shows that in 2021, more than 144,900 people moved into rural Pennsylvania and approximately 123,300 moved out. This movement resulted in a net gain of approximately 21,600 new residents, down from 21,800 in 2019.  The report found that the majority of people (52%) moving to rural Pennsylvania, were from out-of-state.  In fact, more than 54% of the people moving to rural Pennsylvania came from neighboring states New York, New Jersey, and Maryland.  Another 41% of the people who moved to rural areas of the commonwealth came from its urban areas, compared to 2019 when 38% came from urban Pennsylvania.  Lastly, 7% of the people who moved to rural Pennsylvania came from outside of the United States.  Of those who left rural Pennsylvania, 53% went to other states, compared to 61% in 2019.  Fifty-one percent of those moved to one of the following five states: Florida, New York, Maryland, North Carolina, and South Carolina.  Additionally, 47% of those who moved out of rural Pennsylvania relocated to urban areas in 2021.  The report identified working adults and college students as the two largest demographic groups driving in-migration to rural areas of the commonwealth.  Working adults between the ages of 18 and 64 made up 40% of the people who moved out of rural Pennsylvania and 37% of those who moved into rural areas.  College students made up 22% of those who moved into rural Pennsylvania and 18% of those who moved out, according to the report.  Birth & Death Rates  From 2010 to 2020, deaths outnumbered births in rural Pennsylvania, accounting for the loss of nearly 85,000 residents.  Nationally, the birth rate from 2010 to 2020 was 12.13 per 1,000 residents, according to census data.  At 10.87 births per 1,000 residents, Pennsylvania had one of the nation’s lowest birth rates over the same time period with only eight states having lower birth rates.  In rural Pennsylvania, the birth rate was lower than the statewide rate at 9.17 births per 1,000 residents.  The report found that Wayne, Centre, Sullivan, Pike, and Forest counties had the lowest birth rates with each having rates below 8 births per 1,000 residents."

After putting her two children to bed in a Southern California extended-stay hotel, the two-time WNBA All-Star went right back into work mode.  “I’m very fortunate that they want to do this partnership,” Hamby told Yahoo Sports, referencing her endeavor with breast-pump company Willow to help educate working moms about their legal rights and protections in the workplace.  The 29-year-old has a lot on her plate. She’s adjusting to a new team, the Los Angeles Sparks, while caring for her 9-week-old son and 6-year-old daughter. At the same time, Hamby is reckoning with the hurt of being traded from the Las Vegas Aces during her pregnancy. After the January trade, she released a statement detailing “disgusting comments” and “discrimination” from the team with which she had spent her entire eight-year career.  After two investigations by the WNBA, the league on Tuesday rescinded the Aces’ 2025 draft pick and suspended head coach Becky Hammon for two games without pay. Part of the disciplinary action was in response to Hammon’s comments about Hamby’s pregnancy, the league found. Hammon denied those claims Wednesday, saying that she asked about Hamby’s pregnancy once, and her trade was because the team would get additional players.  Now in L.A., Hamby is already back in action. She spent Mother’s Day playing in a scrimmage against the Seattle Storm.  Her choice to get back on the court so soon started from a place of revenge and developed into something more profound. The two-time All-Star is playing to prove something to herself, accepting a role at the forefront of the fight for mothers’ workplace rights in the process.  Dearica Hamby and her daughter, Amaya, at Sparks' media day. (Christina House / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)  The WNBA season starts Friday. The Sparks will have Hamby for their regular-season opener against the Phoenix Mercury, but they didn’t expect to.  “I literally called them a week before camp and was like, ‘Hey, I’m coming to L.A.,’ and they were like, ‘Really?’ and here I am getting ready to play,” Hamby said.  New Sparks head coach Curt Miller and general manager Karen Bryant spent months assuring Hamby that she was safe to take her time and urging her to do so. “No, I’m coming back to play,” she told them before she even knew when that would be.  As she sat in her Las Vegas home and watched athletes get ready for training camp on social media, she couldn’t deny the call of the court. Through injuries and her first pregnancy, the 6-foot-3 forward has never missed a season.  “I had sadness after the trade, and then I had to kind of dial into myself for a little bit,” Hamby said. “Because initially it was about proving the Aces wrong, and I had to be like, ‘Nah, that’s not OK. I need to do it for myself.’ That shouldn’t matter.”  Hamby resumed playing three months after giving birth to her daughter, Amaya. Now, she credits the “determination and willpower” to prove to herself that she can do it again as a motivator.  She informed her new team that she would skip any allotted postpartum rest time and head to training camp “four of five” days before it started — which is why she’s in a hotel temporarily.  “I’m comfortable here,” Hamby said of her “penthouse” digs. “They’re helping me find a new place.” In addition to assisting in the home search, the Sparks are “always asking if there’s any way they can help,” Hamby said. “If I ask something, it gets done right away. It’s just really encouraging and kind of a different feel from what I left toward the end of my situation.”  The experience lingers with Hamby so much that her hands started shaking when she spoke about facing her former team. The Sparks play the Aces on May 25 and 27. Hammon will be suspended during the first game. The second one will be in Las Vegas, following the Aces’ ring ceremony. Hamby played in the 2022 Finals for her former team while pregnant, but her presence for the championship banner unveiling won’t go as she imagined it would.  “I’m just going to try to be myself and play hard. I’m not going to try to do too much,” she said of how she’ll approach those likely emotional games. She’ll still be less than three months postpartum. “It’s not about proving them wrong; you’re where you’re supposed to be,” she said she reminds herself when she becomes too self-critical.  Even though she’s focused on Sparks basketball, her health and her children’s health now, Hamby noted a specific exchange that still holds weight for her.  “A person from the Aces staff made a comment to me when I said that I was pregnant: ‘Nobody asks you about your championships. They ask you about your kids.’ And despite everything, I kind of held that comment close to me, and I continue to live by that,” Hamby said.  In what seems like a perfect response, Hamby brought both of her kids to her first media day with the Sparks earlier this month. In addition to excitement and gratitude, she couldn’t help but feel how different everything was.  “Obviously, I’ve been in such a different situation for so long, so [it’s] just getting back comfortable,” Hamby said. “But it meant a lot to me. Obviously, Legend [her son] doesn’t understand, but Amaya is fully aware, and she understands. She asked questions like, ‘Did you do this with me when I was born?’” Hamby recalled.  In addition to asking questions and helping her mom with her younger brother, Amaya did an interview that the WNBA posted on social media. It offered a reminder of how often the league and Hamby’s former team highlighted her motherhood before the trade.

I think that’s what kind of makes me and my situation so special. It’s because my family comes first.”  With the Sparks, Hamby also will work to remain true to herself as a player. She is known to be a leader, bringing hustle and toughness to the floor. She’s still in the early period of seeing how her play style jells with the Sparks’ roster, but those key traits transition into her life.  When Hamby made her statement after the trade, WNBPA president Nneka Ogwumike issued her new teammate a warning. “You know, this is going to put you in the forefront for working moms in our league, as this continues and it opens up more. Are you going to be OK with that?’” Hamby recalled Ogwumike asking.  Hamby’s response: “I think everything happens for a reason.”  Hamby wants to prevent her struggle from happening to anyone else. The Chicago Sky’s Ruthy Hebard recently became a mom, calling the WNBA moms club “elite company.” Phoenix Mercury’s Skylar-Diggins Smiith also recently welcomed her second child.  “It seems to become more common now. I mean, I think this past year, there are maybe five or six different women that are choosing to carry and have kids,” Hamby said. “It was kind of frowned upon early on in this league. You're just afraid of what would be next after basketball if this didn’t work out or you wouldn’t be able to play.”  That fear is part of her motivation to promote education and resources for parents and companies, even though she shied away from being too vocal early in her career.  ”This is growth,” Hamby said. “When I had my first child and I was nursing, I was pumping in the open. It didn't bother me, but for some moms, it may be a little bit disturbing. We didn't have the resources six years ago.” She acknowledged that progress was made with the most recent CBA to allow WNBA moms their full salaries, but a pregnant player being traded was unprecedented.  “I’m kind of a staple player in this league, who has been praised for being a mom. Then I give birth again, and now it’s kind of like the opposite,” Hamby said. “So if it can happen to me, it can happen to anybody. Now being able to, I think I will be more involved in that [advocacy].”  In addition to being an advocate, Hamby told reporters at a Sparks practice Tuesday that “this part of it is over; me and the union will continue to explore more options.”  In the closed scrimmage Sunday, Miller reportedly gave Hamby substantial minutes to see how she plays through fatigue. Regardless of what approach he takes with her time on Friday, plenty of eyes will be on her."

With the assistance of donor reproductive material, as well as the help of a surrogate or gestational carrier, we have overcome prior limitations to reproduction. But with great power also comes great responsibility. So we often ask whether we are pushing the limits too far, as a matter of medical ethics. There is a danger, though, of applying reflexive norms to new situations. In other words, what can seem “weird” or strange to people today, can become the new normal tomorrow.  In March 2023, reporters across the world announced the birth of a child to the 68-year-old Spanish actress Ana Obregón, by a gestational surrogate in the United States. The news was met with considerable criticism, given 1) her use of a surrogate, which was perfectly legal in the United States but illegal in Spain, and 2) Obregón’s age. However, the real twist was yet to come. A few weeks after initial reports of the new baby’s arrival, more details were revealed. The child was not, in fact, Obregón’s daughter, but actually her granddaughter, conceived with sperm from Obregón’s late son, Aless Lequoio, and presumably donor eggs. Lequoio died in 2020 at the age of 27 from cancer. Obregón explained in an interview to Hola! magazine that having children was her son’s dying wish.  Obregón’s granddaughter’s conception story is unique, but are the concerns of detractors justified? Let’s take the objections one by one.  Surrogacy in general. First, Obregón is from a country where surrogacy is illegal. Spain, like most Western European countries, does not permit surrogacy arrangements, even when no compensation changes hands. Not all European countries have the same policy — England, for instance, permits altruistic gestational surrogacy, where the gestational carrier receives no compensation. And Eastern European countries, like Ukraine and Russia, permit both gestational surrogacy and compensation of the surrogate, but only for intended parents who are heterosexual married couples.  The United States, of course, has numerous state-by-state legal regimes when it comes to surrogacy. Most U.S. states have surrogacy-supportive laws that are open to all families, including same-sex couples and single parents. While much ink is spilled pondering the differences in culture and law, much of it boils down to fundamental societal beliefs.  In Europe and much of the world, policymakers have articulated a fear of the exploitation of women in the context of surrogacy. The risk, they see, is in economically coercing women in poor economic situations to risk their health and lives for those with more means. The U.S., by contrast, has a more capitalist culture that relies primarily on individual responsibility. The result is more supportive laws that give a woman the freedom to make the risk assessment for herself, and to freely, without interference from the government, act as a surrogate.  The varying attitudes become more entrenched, as public policy mirrors cultural norms.  Age. Next up, Obregón’s age: 68. Some states have a minimum age for a surrogate or intended parent to enter into a surrogacy arrangement, such as the age of 21 in Colorado; but no state has a maximum age prescribed by law. There are guidelines, however, such as those set by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM).  By way of an Ethics Committee Opinion, ASRM recommends that “because of concerns related to the high-risk nature of pregnancy, as well as longevity, treatment of women over the age of 55 should generally be discouraged.” The opinion explains that the reasoning is not just about a health risk to a woman carrying a pregnancy at an older age, but concerns of the death of a parent while the child is still young.  “Parental loss is one of the most stressful life events for children or adolescents. Although a 50-year-old Caucasian woman in the U.S. has a life-expectancy of over 80 years, on average, it is more likely that a woman who starts her family at 50 rather than at 30 will die before her child reaches adulthood.” On the other hand, the Ethics Committee Opinion points out that “very few studies have been published about parenting in women who conceived and delivered after natural menopause. The limited data, however, do not support concerns that older parents have reduced parenting capacity.” In fact, “the greater financial and emotional stability some older parents offer may be an advantage to children.” Score one for older parents.  And, of course, this is without getting into the misogynistic judgment of older women as parents while men have children at an older age all the time. To applause. BTW, congrats to Robert De Niro, 79, on the recent birth of his seventh child.  Posthumous conception. Among the criticisms in this situation, one of the most common is focused on Obregón’s use of her deceased son’s sperm to conceive her granddaughter. Most states in the United States do not have specific legal prohibition preventing the use of a person’s sperm or eggs after their death. However, as a practice, it’s often difficult for survivors to show sufficient consent from the deceased to make a medical provider comfortable moving forward. At least one court — a New York case involving a West Point cadet named Peter Zhu — granted the parents the right to have their son’s sperm retrieved while he was on life support. The court relied on evidence of the son’s statements during his lifetime that he wished to have children.  I have written on posthumous conception before and on my confession of evolving beliefs. Despite writing a lengthy law review article in 2015 stressing the importance of explicit consent of the deceased before using their gametes, I have more recently come to believe that in many cases, perhaps too much emphasis is placed on such explicit consent. The survivors that conceive children using the reproductive material of a deceased loved one tend to be of healthy economic means and to have children that come into the world very much wanted, loved, and supported. We could only wish for that same level of love and support for every child.  I get it. Obregón’s family structure is unusual. But I, for one, support her. Congratulations to Ana and baby Ana. Wishing you both a bright future."

In front of a judge on Wednesday, with her parents by her side, Melissa Highsmith officially changed her name back to the one given to her at birth.  ""It's like God has given me a second chance at life. It's like I'm starting over,” she said.  Melissa was abducted as an infant by her babysitter 51 years ago. Despite her family immediately contacting the police and beginning an exhaustive search, she was never found.  “I just believed that wherever she was, that’s where God wanted her,” her mother Alta Apantenco said.  Melissa, now 53, ended up living a difficult life under a new name, Melanie Walden. She never knew her true family was searching for her all these years.  “We have been rejoicing, we all know it’s happening. God is putting his faithfulness and love and power on full display,"" said family pastor Shane Gray at the courthouse on Wednesday. ""In the darkest nights of Melissa‘s life, she was not alone. In the most hopeless moments of the Highsmith’s search for their daughter, there was hope.”  Posters and flyers were circulated for years. An age-progressed photo by the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children was even released later on but leads, some in other parts of the country, were dead ends.  A previous flyer with a depiction of what authorities thought Melissa looked like  ""We had several times rechecked some leads, but they were nothing,” Alta said.  Over the years as her parents grew older, Melissa’s siblings took over the search. They helped Melissa’s father, Jeffrie Highsmith, take a DNA test with 23andMe to see where it took them in their search.  It was a success. A match was found with one of Melissa’s three children. Soon, the Highsmith family learned Melissa had been living in the Fort Worth area the entire time.  ""And to know that she was here all these years, it's disappointing,” said Alta. “But I’m happy that we’re together again. I’m just really excited about what’s going to come.”  She reunited with her parents and several siblings just before the holidays. The Highsmith family shared their reunion story with NBC 5 in November 2022.  ""It was hope that brought Melissa home. It really was prayer and hope,” said Melissa’s brother, Jeffrie. “It’s a dream come true.”  The family has been making up for lost time ever since. Melissa has been meeting four siblings and droves of nephews, nieces, uncles, aunts and cousins.  Her cousin Jannae Hayes, who held onto a picture of themselves as infants playing in a crib, ended up naming her own daughter after Melissa.  ""She's our missing puzzle piece, she was the piece that was always missing and now our family is complete.” Melissa’s sister, Victoria  “I don’t think we ever thought we would find her. So to find her and get her back and for her to be able to get her name back that they stole from her. It’s a special day today.”  Just two weeks ago, Fort Worth police officially confirmed Melissa's identity through their own DNA testing, which allowed her to change her name in court.  ""I feel fantastic getting her name back to where it should've been after all these years,” said Melissa’s father, Jeffrie.  Melissa said she now plans to get a passport in her official name so she can go visit another sibling who happens to live in Spain.  She also plans to hold another wedding ceremony with her husband using her new name ... So that her real father can walk her down the aisle.  ""I just know God was with me watching over me. It gives me goosebumps. He heard their prayers and everything,” Melissa said of the experience. ""It's just indescribable. I'm on top of the world."""

The Tasmanian devil named Adventurous Lisa was released into a 1,000-acre wildlife sanctuary in Australia's Barrington Tops by Chris Hemsworth and his wife, Elsa Pataky.  Their efforts were part of a collaborative project between Aussie Ark, Re:wild, WildArk, and the Australian Reptile Park, that began after the Tasmanian devil population vanished entirely from mainland Australia.  Aussie Ark  Before Hemsworth and Pataky reintroduced the little marsupials to Australia, the last time a Tasmanian devil set a paw on Australia's mainland had been over 3,000 years ago. Since their reintroduction, the 11 animals have been monitored through regular surveys, radio collars fitted with transmitters, and camera traps.  Aussie Ark discovered Lisa's joeys through one of their routine health examinations.  Aussie Ark managing director Tim Faulkner explained in a news release: ""We were in the middle of routine devil health checks when we were overjoyed to discover Lisa had joeys.""  ""This is the very first confirmed devil joeys of 2023, and proof yet again that our breeding program and rewilding program is working,"" he added.  Aussie Ark  ""This is a great example of how returning a species to its wild home can rewild the entire ecosystem,"" Janice Chanson, a Re:wild senior associate of species conservation, shared in a statement. ""This is particularly important in combatting climate change and biodiversity loss and in improving the overall health of our planet.""  After the discovery, initial pouch checks showed that Lisa's joeys appeared in excellent health. Aussie Ark rangers are expected to continue monitoring Lisa through camera traps and will conduct follow-up pouch checks in the coming weeks.  Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.

Over the course of the next four days, Kim would go through a long process of induced labor.  Finally, at 3:35 a.m. on the morning of commencement, Aaliyah-Iris Tabaquin Jose entered the world weighing seven pounds three ounces.  “We joked afterwards that she was waiting because she wanted to make a grand entrance on the day of graduation,” Chris said.  Only a few hours after the birth, Chris’ joy would be immortalized forever as he appeared live on screen at the Global Campus commencement ceremony to raucous applause. He was standing in a hospital room, proudly holding Aaliyah-Iris in his arms with a huge smile on his face. Kim, lying in the hospital bed next to him, held his diploma cover.  Aaliyah-Iris Tabaquin Jose  “The whole day was a rollercoaster of emotions. We were anxious, excited, happy, and nervous, but felt overwhelming support from our families and the staff at the hospital,” said Chris. “I was also very tired. But most of all, I was just excited to share that memory with my daughter when she is older.”  “She graduated with me at just a few hours old, and who can say that? It’s a very special thing.”  Jose is no stranger to medical situations. He’s a veteran of the U.S. Navy, where he worked as a Hospital Corpsman before leaving active duty in 2018. He later worked as a CT scan and MRI technician at a Veteran’s Affairs Hospital in Portland and currently does the same job at a private clinic.  After leaving the Navy, Jose opted to use his military education benefits to begin taking classes at WSU’s Vancouver campus. Later, he would transfer to WSU Global Campus, deciding that the flexibility of online learning was the best fit for his work and family obligations.  “Earning my degree online was a great process and experience. Being able to access classes from different locations made it possible for me to provide for my family and earn a degree at the same time,” said Jose. “The transition from brick and mortar was easy because of the guidance of the academic advisors, the veteran’s affairs office at Vancouver and Pullman, and the professors who really worked with me and my schedule.”  Now that Jose is a Coug alum, he plans to use his degree to advance his career in medical care and possibly open doors to other fields.  Chris and his wife Kim  “I plan to use many of the skills I learned in my WSU courses to help with clinical coordination and promotion at my current job,” he said. “I also want to keep my options open as far as career paths in project management or administration. For me, it’s all about providing for my family.”  Jose is excited to start the next phase of his life as a father and a college graduate. He’s also grateful to those who supported him along the way.  “I want to thank and acknowledge my wife Kim for supporting me during my time at WSU, especially throughout her pregnancy,” he said. “I also want to thank my parents and my sister, who is also a WSU alum, for pushing me to continue school and see it through to graduation.”"

Content creator Bramty Juliette revealed that she wanted her husband and her mom around when she was welcoming her firstborn into this world. However, things didn’t go quite according to plan. The woman opened up about her experience on a podcast she co-hosts with her husband, the snippet of which was later uploaded on her TikTok account. Scroll down to find the video below.  In their viral video, content creator Bramty Juliette discussed her first childbirth experience with her husband  Image credits: nd3000  “The reason why I really didn’t like your mom back then”  Image credits: bramty  “I was giving birth to Penelope and I let his mom be in the room to watch me give birth, which was also a huge issue. ‘I don’t want your mom in the room. I only want you. I only want you and my mom in the room, you’re my husband, and my mom for emotional support.’ And he’s said, ‘I want my mom in the room.'”  “No, it’s not about you. It’s my mom, like, I want her in the room”  Image credits: bramty  “‘No, it’s not about you.’ And he didn’t really understand. She’s the one giving birth. And that wasn’t the case”  “When you give birth, it’s about the wife. She’s the one going through things physically, mentally”  Image credits: bramty  “At the moment, like my water breaks, I go to the hospital and it’s my first time giving birth. I’m 19 years old. I’m having contractions. I remember having contractions. And I was like, I’m gonna do birth without an epidural. So I try to push it through as long as I could. And at the time, I was just so focused on, my contractions.”  “We had my mom, you, your mom, your brother, and your aunt who I never spoke to in my whole life in the room, watching my birth”  Image credits: bramty  “Interviewer: ‘Cause it’s Cuban people. They just want to be, involved and think everything’s fine. Nothing’s taboo, everything’s fine.’  He should have had my back then. You should have had my back then. ‘All right, Bramty, you’re about to give birth. Everybody out. Only what my wife wants.’ But you didn’t have that mentality and you just had your mom’s back most of the time. So I remember I just wasn’t even involved with, who was in the room. I remember pushing.”  “I remember your mom and your aunt taking pictures of my vagina while I am pushing, then later finding out that your aunt had sent those pictures to family members”  Bramty’s TikTok video attracted over five million views  Having loved ones around during childbirth can make it a more positive experience  Image credits: Jonathan Borba (not the actual photo)  Bramty shared her story of giving birth on the newly-released BRAMTEA podcast that she hosts together with her husband Luis Espina. Previously known from their YouTube channel, titled The Bramfam, the couple discussed how—as Bramty stated in her video description—her mother-in-law ruined her childbirth experience.  The woman said she wanted her husband and her mother to be there in the room with her, which is not an unusual request. The World Health Organization (WHO) emphasized that support coming from the people the expectant mother trusts can help make labor and childbirth a more positive experience. The loved ones can aid her in numerous ways, including facilitating communication between the staff and the mom-to-be, providing practical and emotional support, and assisting with non-pharmacological pain relief methods, among other things.  Having a trustworthy person around can indeed help reduce discomfort, as research shows that there’s a positive correlation between a spouse’s participation in childbirth and pain relief. Moreover, the study pointed out that their presence is beneficial not only for the mother herself, but also for their partner, which is why the majority of spouses say they would participate in subsequent births as well.  Nowadays, quite a few dads are present during the birth of their child but that wasn’t always the case  Image credits: Craig Adderley (not the actual photo)  Positive effects of having a partner present during childbirth might be one of the reasons quite a few expectant mothers want them by their side during such a significant moment. Some research suggests that as much as 85% of women say they would like their husband to be there.  NPR pointed out that even though nowadays seeing fathers in the delivery room is quite common, it wasn’t as usual back in the day. Medical historian Judy Leavitt told NPR that traditionally giving birth was mostly a female event. Even when the births moved from home to the hospital in the 20th century, husbands would typically remain in the waiting rooms. According to the historian, fathers started staying around for the birth of their babies roughly in the ‘70s and ‘80s.  A 2016 study of the birth experience from the perspective of the fathers revealed that their attendance in childbirth had a positive effect on all of the main parties involved—the mother, the newborn, and the dads themselves. According to the study, as much as 94% of them were happy to be present for such an event. However, they admitted to feeling some extent of helplessness and fear as well, in addition being somewhat overwhelmed by the event.  Considering the benefits of having your partner by your side while giving birth, it’s understandable why Bramty wanted her husband around. She also wanted her mother to be there, who is arguably a person she trusts; and according to the World Health Organization, compassion and trustworthiness are two of the main characteristics that pregnant women seek in their companions during childbirth. The content creator might have not felt the same level of connection with her husband’s family. In addition to that, she didn’t appreciate some of their actions, which seemingly shocked quite a few people in the comments as well.  The online community had plenty to say about the situation  Some people shared stories about similar personal experiences"

At 29 weeks pregnant, LeBlanc told ChurchPOP that doctors scheduled her c-section for June 2. However, due to slowed growth and slowed heartbeats, they moved the procedure to May 16.  Knowing the twins' condition, Nicole and Austin had a priest ""on standby"" for the sacraments of baptism and confirmation immediately after delivery.  They also made preparations for the cemetery and funeral home.  Here's Nicole's update the day before she gave birth:  The hospital just called me from the preemie department and told me that since they will be born at 32 weeks, their lungs are still immature and with their shared heart will make things more difficult. I’m making all of the preparations for the cemetery and funeral home now. — Nicole LeBlanc🇻🇦 (@nicolita_d) May 15, 2023  LeBlanc told followers that despite complications and an ""emotional eight months,"" she said ""being pregnant with two saints"" was ""totally worth it.""  Concluding her latest announcement, LeBlanc asked for the twins' intercession.  ""St. Maria Therese and Saint Rachel Clare, ora pro nobis. Austin and I love you more than you could ever know. Now, my princesses, you rest in the beatific vision of Our Lord and Lady."""

(WSFA) - Some Republican lawmakers want to define womanhood in state law. The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Susan DuBose, R-Jefferson County, calls her bill the What is a Woman Act, and she says the goal is to protect women. However, members of the LGBTQ community have said the goal is to erase the existence of transgender people.  The bill defines male and female based on someone’s biological sex at birth.  Andrea Trenaman was one of the many trans and cisgender women who spoke out against a bill that defines male and female based on someone’s sex at birth.  “This bill seeks to solve a problem that doesn’t exist. It implies that I, as a trans woman, am transitioning for nefarious purposes,” said Trenaman.  Trenaman is an engineer. Opponents are concerned about the state losing talent.  “It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to know this is a bad bill, but yet here I am,” said Trenaman.  “As far as branding, we’re not saying that we’re open for everyone,” said Rep. Jeremy Gray, D-Lee County.  DuBose says her bill still allows people to choose their gender and identity. She says gender identity is different than biological sex.  “This bill does not alter anyone’s legal rights. This bill does not create any new restrictions based on gender identity or transgender status,” said DuBose.  She says her goal is to protect women.  “If we don’t codify common sex-based terms, then laws that prohibit sex-based discrimination will cease to mean anything at all, and single-sex private spaces will cease to disappear,” said DuBose.  The only public proponent of the bill was Becky Gerritson with Eagle Forum Alabama.  “This law simply codifies biological reality,” said Gerritson.  Rep. Pebblin Warren, D-Lee County, says the state needs to focus on other things.  “We’re number 50 in education. We don’t have healthcare for people who are in need, and we’re sitting up here trying to tell somebody how to live their lives,” said Warren.  The committee plans to hold a vote on this bill next week. DuBose says there will be at least one amendment to define an unknown sex, for cases when a child’s sex cannot be determined at birth.

For the first time, the number of births in a year fell below 400,000 – representing an average of 1.25 babies per woman, according to official figures for 2022.  This means that the replacement rate is now negative, since the number of deaths currently exceeds the number of births – 12 deaths for every seven births.  Italy is the world’s 8th largest economy and has a population of just under 60 million. In 2022, the southern European country registered just 393,000 babies, according to the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT), the lowest since records began in 1861.  Babies born in Italy to unregistered migrants and to some same-sex and heterosexual Italian couples who used surrogacy abroad are not automatically part of the official record, according to Italy’s national birth registrar.  And if the trend does not reverse itself, the country could face an economic “dark age,” as there will be a decline in the number of people entering the workforce even as more people retire.  “In our pension system, which is a pay-as-you-go system, where the current workers pay for the pension benefits of the current retired people, this will create a big challenge and burden,” Maria Rita Testa, a professor of demography at Luiss University in Rome, told CNN.  “The projections by the government show that the peak in terms of pension spending will be reached in 2044,” Testa said, to meet the needs of the large baby boomer generation.  By 2030, Italy can expect 2 million workers to have entered retirement with no corresponding new members of the workforce to pay their pensions, according to Testa.  The birth rate in Italy has been declining steadily since the economic crisis in 2008, for reasons demographers agree is rooted in economic insecurity. The average monthly income across Italy is €2,475 a month, according to ISTAT. But the average rental property is €12.12 ($13.16) per square meter, meaning a 100 square meter family apartment costs €1,212 ($1,316) – roughly half the monthly budget.  Italy also used to be a country of savers, with the average Italian saving 20% of annual income, according to ISTAT figures, in part because many families live in multi-generational homes or homes bought by their parents. But when the COVID-19 pandemic hit and Italy locked down, the annual savings rate dropped to just over 11% by July 2020, and dropped further, to just over 5% of annual income, as of January 2023, according to the World Bank and ISTAT.  For couples of child-bearing age, many of whom are just entering the workforce, that translates to hesitancy when it comes to starting a family. “For those who have to decide to make the transition to parenthood, to become parents, the big problem is to find a solid job [and] economic independence to allow them to get the credit to buy a house and to start building a family,” Testa said.  In order to spur a baby boom, the Italian government has been toying with incentives, starting with the government of Mario Draghi, which in May 2021 introduced monthly payments of up to €175 ($190) per child, a policy which has been continued by the government of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. Draghi’s plan included pumping $25.4 million into the economy to boost childcare and hire more women and young people.  But other countries, including Germany and France, do far more for potential parents, although that doesn’t always translate to higher birth rates. In Germany, where new parents can take up to three years of partially paid or unpaid maternity leave, the birth rate is just slightly higher than Italy, at an average of 1.4 babies per woman for the first half of 2022.  In France, the birth rate is higher at 1.8 children per woman, according to figures for 2022 from its national statistics agency.  The situation in Italy is unique for two reasons. The Catholic Church, which is a predominant political force, and the right-wing government under Meloni have both lamented the low birth rate, but have put up roadblocks to ways to remedy the situation.  Meloni’s government has promoted the traditional family, criticized assisted reproduction like surrogacy for both heterosexual and gay couples, and rejected the idea of offering birth right to immigrants, even to those born of permanent, tax-paying residents.  “I want a country where it’s not scandalous to say we are still born from a man and a woman and where it’s not a taboo to say that maternity is not for sale or that we don’t rent uteruses,” Meloni said last week at a conference to address the dwindling birth rate.  Pope Francis, who also attended the conference, said that a lack of births meant a lack of hope, and hinted at the idea that “acceptance and inclusion” beyond Italian borders could help populate the country.  Italy is undergoing an unprecedented surge in irregular migration, with 45,510 people arriving in Italy by sea between January 1 and May 16 this year.  None of those arriving are guaranteed asylum or protection unless they undergo a lengthy asylum process. And none of the babies born during that process will be counted in Italy’s demographic statistics or integrated into Italian society, because they are now kept in migrant camps after Italy declared a state of emergency last month.  Francesco Lollobrigida, Meloni’s brother-in-law and the country’s minister of agriculture, raised eyebrows last month when he suggested that Italians “were at risk of ethnic replacement” if migration wasn’t put in check. “That’s not the way forward,” he said.  Claudia Giagheddu Saitta, 27, and Gabriele De Luca, 31, are concerned about raising a family with so many uncertainties. Tax cuts on baby products and birth incentives aren’t enough, they say.  “The government thinks €10,000 ($10,800) is enough to have a child. But the incentives are temporary. A child lasts forever,” Giagheddu Saitta says. She says the idea of having more than one child, if she has one at all, feels impossible.  De Luca blames the government for not doing enough for the younger generation, in part because decades of low birth rates have made the youth a minority. He says that because governments are voted in by people in their 50s, 60s and 70s, their interests come first. “The government has to take risks. They have to take unpopular decisions if they really want to stimulate growth. They have to represent the side of the youth.”  Less than one quarter of women born in 1980, who are now 43, have children, according to the national birth registrar. Some want children, but can’t afford them, and others are choosing to remain childless.  Italian mothers are the oldest in Europe and, according to a number of professionals CNN spoke to, it is because they feel they need to reach a certain level of financial and a work stability before they’re comfortable starting a family, which is usually in their 30s.  Testa fears that the low birth rate is contagious. It used to be that foreigners living in Italy had far more children than Italian women, but now they are adapting to the economic climate and aligning with the Italian birth rate.  “The low fertility trap says if women and men get used to small family size it might become the ideal, the reference model,” she says. “And if it is a reference model, the one child family, the fertility (rate) will even go lower and create a downward spiral of low fertility.”  The-CNN-Wire™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Calves are being born, and they should be left alone.  Mother’s day, it’s not just for humans. Moose cows are giving birth around this time. And experts say, we should watch out. Carl Koch is a wildlife biologist with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, and he warns that the animals can be particularly touchy when they have newly born calves.  Koch: “When they first give birth, the calf has to build muscle until it can grow strong enough to run from danger. The most common thing they’ll do is bed down when they are in trouble, mom knows they can’t run away, so she’ll get very defensive.”  Koch says the cow’s most common defense is to stomp on whatever is threatening their calf. A moose can kick in any direction with its front hooves.  Koch says that cows frequently leave their calves alone for a day, knowing they will not be able to go far. Sometimes people will find a calf in this situation and assume it is orphaned.  Koch: “Interfering in that can make matters worse.”  Koch remembers one occasion a few years ago in Haines, when people crowded around a calf. He says this probably prevented the mother from reuniting with her newborn.  Koch: “ “They may just abandon the calf, they often have twins, so they might just cut their losses if one of them is in a spot where they are having trouble getting back to it because people aren’t leaving it alone. When folks call and say there is a calf in their backyard and they are worried about it, I say leave it alone, and if they have pets, I say please keep the dogs out of the backyard. Some folks want to keep checking on it every hour, we prefer they just leave it alone.”  He says almost every time, within a day and a half they will have moved on. Koch says of all the moose charges he hears about, around half occur at this time of year. He got a report of one person with a loose dog being charged by a cow this Tuesday in Gustavus.  Cows will generally give birth to their first calf two or three years after their own birth. They will get pregnant in September during the breeding -and hunting- season, and give birth mid-May. That makes their pregnancy about the same length as a human’s. But they do it almost every year. In an area with plentiful food, like the Chilkat Valley near Haines, Koch estimates that up to 90% of females of breeding age will give birth in any one year. With the valley’s moose population around 350 individuals, Koch guesses about a hundred calves could be born this spring.  The calves will weigh the same as a mid size dog. They will get milk from their mother, but can also eat leafy plants, like willow and dogwood, just after birth. As they age, they progressively shift to an all plant diet. Koch says around one in three calves will survive the summer.  Adult females can reach over a thousand pounds, and live up to seventeen years in the wild.  For anyone running into one of the irritable new mothers, Koch has one piece of advice.  Koch: “If a moose is charging you, do the opposite of what you do with a bear. Run and get behind something big.”  Koch likes to keep tabs on these encounters. He says every year in Alaska, some people are injured by moose. He asks that any dangerous interaction with a moose be reported to the state’s Department of Fish and Game, or the Alaska Wildlife Troopers.  Koch wants to remind the public to leave all wild animals alone."

If you like what you read and want it in your inbox, sign up here.  At a time when reproductive health can feel increasingly politicized and polarized in American society, a landmark change may be around the corner without a big, flashy debate: over-the-counter birth control pills.  Last week, one of the Food and Drug Administration’s advisory committees voted unanimously to support making one type of birth control medication available over-the-counter, switching away from prescription-only status. It’s taken “Free the Pill” advocates nearly two decades to get here. And many of them did not expect the FDA to consider this change against the backdrop of an intense abortion debate.  “There are so many hostile attacks on sexual reproductive health care. So, as an advocate, it’s surprising when we might actually be very close to a win,” Candace Gibson, of the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Justice, told me.  I found myself fascinated by why there is not more organized opposition. So, I started asking around.  It turns out that both Republicans and Democrats have come out in favor of making the pill available without a prescription. When I reached out to March for Life, an anti-abortion organization, I got a short email saying the group “doesn’t take a position on birth control.” Same with the conservative Massachusetts Family Institute.  Then I spoke to Elizabeth Janiak, a researcher at Harvard’s School of Public Health, who has been tracking the issue. She assured me that many people involved in grassroots organizing against abortion also oppose contraception — and they often oppose it “just as fervently.” But “they have not chosen to make their opposition to contraception a major political goal,” she quickly added.  She had a few explanations for why. She said some conservatives — who oppose the Affordable Care Act requirement that insurance companies cover the cost of certain preventative health services — think of over-the-counter birth control as a “free market” alternative. It is seen as evidence that not all people need health insurance since there are other ways to access preventive care.  Another explanation for the lack of opposition, Janiak said, is that the pill is just too common — it’s taken daily by millions in the U.S.  “Because it’s so widely used and because it has been used for so long, pretty much everyone either has used the pill or knows someone who has. And so we can all say from our own personal experience, ‘Yeah, this drug seems perfectly safe,’ ” Janiak said.  Of course, there’s the religious perspective to consider, too. The Catholic Church is opposed to hormonal contraception and has been the main opposition to taking the pill over-the-counter. But evangelical groups that have been a driving force in efforts to ban abortion often don’t oppose contraception.  I spoke with some evangelical activists who said the pill is widely used within their circles. Some of them said the community is slowly waking up to “moral problems with the pill,” but — currently — there is no large-scale opposition.  This lack of consensus within conservative religious groups, some observers surmise, is keeping many grassroots organizations from taking a strong stance on the topic. (As I mentioned in a newsletter last summer, evangelical groups have said there should be an age restriction if the pill becomes available without a prescription.)  Even if the politics of the pill and abortion are very different, Janiak warned that nothing is happening in a silo. She said where things land in the legal battle over the abortion medication mifepristone — and what the case signals about whether judges can overrule FDA decisions — could make a difference for potential future legal challenges to an FDA decision on the pill. But first, the FDA has to make the switch official. That decision is expected this summer.  Sign up for the CommonHealth: Boston's Weekly Health Newsletter"

Ms. Rivers answered that she had smoked marijuana at a family barbecue hours earlier. She thought nothing of it — it was August 2021; marijuana had been legal in New York for months.  Without Ms. Rivers’s consent, she said, she and her baby were tested for drugs. Both were positive for marijuana. Two days later, the city’s child welfare agency, the Administration for Children’s Services, ordered the hospital not to release the baby to Ms. Rivers, her lawyers said."

Debates about reducing healthcare costs are perennial, with a seemingly endless supply of proposals. Last July, Elizabeth Bruenig of The Atlantic provocatively proposed that Americans – especially those in the Pro-Life movement – should “agree that pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum care should all be free, and demand that the federal government make it so.”  Variations of Bruenig’s proposal have circulated in subsequent months, and on April 25th, The Institute for Human Ecology at the Catholic University of America hosted a panel discussion titled “Should Birth Be Free?” Matthew Walther , editor of The Lamp, moderated the discussion. Tom Shakeley, Chief Engagement Officer at Americans United for Life (AUL), argued in favor of government-funded birth. AUL has published suggestions for how Congress could take steps to eliminate the costs of births for American families. Washington Post columnist Megan McArdle was skeptical of the efficacy of such a program.  Shakeley – who referenced Bruenig’s piece multiple times during the panel – began his argument with an emphasis on community, suggesting that birth is not an abstract concept; rather, babies are human persons born into particular families and communities.  According to Shakeley, eliminating the medical cost of births “is a way to strengthen our social fabric, not just for families, but for our whole country.” Shakeley believes the inherent goodness of birth for both families and society at large needs to be emphasized, especially amidst post-Dobbs debates about abortion. He suggested that publicly funding births would help change public opinion on these topics and provide a “substantive” Pro-Life policy. Shakeley also highlighted the threat of depopulation as a reason for supporting such a policy, as well as the potential GDP benefits of more children in the United States.  While Shakeley’s arguments were optimistically philosophical, McArdle’s were more pragmatic. McArdle noted agreement with Shakeley on various points but ultimately disagreed on the benefits of government-funded birth.  “I don’t think that making birth free solves any particular problem,” McArdle said, characterizing such a policy as primarily symbolic. She noted that many births are already government-funded through Medicaid, and stated her belief that medical insurance should “cover expenses that most people don’t have,” which would exclude births.  McArdle also suggested families could still have to pay birth costs through taxes or insurance premiums. “Someone’s got to pay for it one way or other, and that someone is going to be, by and large, the same people who are having the babies.”  Moving to larger scale issues, McArdle noted the tenuous long-term status of other government programs like Social Security and stated that covering birth expenses “adds a burden onto the government when the government is not yet prepared to finance the burdens that it’s already taken on.”  Shakeley countered that funding births would only add $40-50 billion to the annual federal budget, a small percentage of federal healthcare spending. McArdle granted this point, but still expressed concerns about adding even marginal spending. She expressed further concerns about excess government involvement in healthcare, citing logistical issues revealed by the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.  McArdle also spoke against Shakeley’s belief that government-funded births would encourage Americans to have more children, suggesting there are other reasons for decreasing birth rates in recent years. She suggested that there is little evidence that these other, mostly cultural, reasons for low birth rates would be aided much by government programs which “give people big chunks of cash for having kids.”  Shakeley responded by citing examples of government policies changing society, noting the impact of the interstate system and public schools. He also expanded on his previous comments regarding societal goods, suggesting that making births free would promote the common good just as previous policies had.  In response to an audience question pushing her on the role of the government, McArdle noted that the government can affect culture. She reiterated that she did not believe government-funded birth would notably affect culture.  McArdle also cited anecdotal evidence to support her position: “When I talk to people in their 20s who are delaying marriage and family, the cost of giving birth has, I think, literally never come up.”  Both Shakeley and McArdle presented compelling points supporting their respective positions, and their discussion highlighted various key philosophical and economic factors surrounding debates about whether birth should be free for families – factors which conservative or conservative-leaning people may disagree about (McArdle mostly referred to herself as a libertarian, but often expressed socially conservative personal views). In the still-young post-Dobbs world, the Pro-Life movement has much to consider and debate about how best to support the preservation and flourishing of human life."

Today, Chaffee serves on the board of directors for Maryland Families for Safe Birth (MFSB), a grassroots organization created in 2011 with the hopes of passing legislation for the licensure of Certified Professional Midwives (now known as Direct Entry Midwives or DEMs) in Maryland, which was accomplished in 2015. “Midwives can offer very individualized care, which can sometimes be hard to for doctors when they’re serving the masses,” says Evelyn Fielding, also on MFSB’s board of directors.  Thanks to the group’s determination, access to legal and safe homebirth care has been increased significantly throughout the state in the past eight years. In addition, the group says it’s made strides in fostering stronger relationships between midwives and OB-GYNs—making the transfer from prenatal care to the delivery room more safe and seamless for parents who choose that trajectory.  But there’s much more work to be done with regard to the organization’s overall goal, which is to advocate for all Marylanders to make personalized, evidence-based decisions about what maternity care works best for them. As Fielding points out, for minorities, the stakes are alarmingly higher. According to the Maryland Patient Safety Center, Black Women are two times more likely than White Women to face severe complications during pregnancy, and three-to-four times more likely to die as a result of them.  “We’re committed to working on health disparities and equity issues within the medical system,” Fielding adds.  With this mission at the forefront, in 2019, MFSB hosted its first-ever Baltimore Birth Festival, an event which aims to offer families and new parents inclusive tools to help with pregnancy, birthing, and postpartum care. On Sunday, May 21, the free festival—which wavered for a bit due to the pandemic—is returning to Patterson Park in an effort to forge a village of resources for new parents.  “Our target was to have an event where we could bring together all kinds of birth workers—people who would service families from pregnancy through postpartum to having young children ages zero to five,” Fielding says, citing similar events like the Birth and Babies Fair in Frederick, hosted by Maryland nonprofit The Birthing Circle. “We kind of modeled it after that—having a beautiful outdoor festival where local families can come and learn about these resources.”  From 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., families can get to know visitors including Odile Penet and Kristie Graybill of The Womb Room in Hampden; Katy Linda of The Rumina Center for postpartum wellness in Cross Keys; pelvic floor specialist Dr. Sam DuFlo of Indigo Physiotherapy in Roland Park; and fitness experts from mom and me-inspired exercise program FIT4MOM Baltimore City.  Little ones can enjoy bubble-blowing, hula-hooping, and coloring, along with tunes by kid-friendly musician Mr. Jon and tricks by magician Eric Henning. Attendees who check in will receive two raffle tickets to win baby gear like carriers and wraps. They will also have a chance to purchase $30 swag bags filled with baby items, product samples, coupons, and more raffle tickets.  Fielding hopes the afternoon will help birthers and their families to feel more in control of their individualized birthing experiences.  “Many people are familiar with what a doula or a midwife is, but finding those providers can be difficult if you don’t know where to look,” says Fielding, “This is a great place to [connect with them.] We’re spreading the word that there is support out there for people who need it.”"

Lauren and her twin brother, David, spent the first four months of their lives in the neonatal intensive care unit at St. Luke’s University Hospital in Fountain Hill after their birth in March 2001.  They were delivered by emergency caesarean section at 29 weeks. Lauren was just 1 pound, 10 ounces; David was 2 pounds, 13 ounces.  Among the nurses who cared for them was Susan Foster.  In July, Weintraub, newly graduated from the nursing program at Cedar Crest College, will join Foster as a NICU nurse at St. Luke’s-Allentown.  Now 22, Weintraub graduated Saturday. Just before the ceremony, Foster, who inspired and supported Weintraub on her journey through nursing school, was the one to place a pin on her during the pinning ceremony.  “I took care of Lauren as a baby at the start of my career as a NICU nurse,” the 65-year-old Foster said. “I’m at the tail end of my career but to know that I’ll be working with her at the bedside is incredible. To have the opportunity to pass on the knowledge I’ve gained over the years, it’s amazing.”  It won’t be the first time they’ve worked together. During Weintraub’s final clinical rotation at the Allentown campus, Foster served as her nurse preceptor, the person who watched over her and helped her put what she learned in nursing school into practice.  “I learned from the best of the best of the best,” Weintraub said.  As a NICU nurse with more than 20 years of experience and a mother to children who were born prematurely, Foster knows what it’s like to provide and receive excellent care in the NICU.  In 1989 she gave birth to twin boys at 29 weeks gestation, an experience that changed her life forever.  “I barely even knew what a NICU was, to be honest with you, but I was inspired by the nurses that took care of my boys. They were incredible,” Foster said. “It was truly probably one of the scariest times of my life but those nurses were amazing. They became my family.”  At the time, Foster was a flight attendant, but she decided on a career change. She went back to school and became a nurse in 1998. She started working in the NICU at St. Luke’s University Hospital in 2000.  “I couldn’t think of anything else that was more important to me than giving a little baby a chance at a great life like those nurses did for my boys,” Foster said.  Both of Weintraub’s parents are nurses, and Weintraub said from an early age she knew she wanted to do something health care related. The NICU stayed close to Weintraub’s heart as she was growing up. Every year on Christmas Eve, she and her brother would visit with cookies for the nurses.  “They loved seeing how much we’d grown each year and the new things we were doing,” Weintraub said.  But the Bethlehem native said she didn’t know she wanted to be a NICU nurse until middle school, when she volunteered in the Fountain Hill campus NICU through the St. Luke’s March of Dimes program.  “All of those nurses inspired me, just the way that they handled those babies and their natural ability to calm them and care for them was absolutely amazing to me,” Weintraub said. “And I realized how much I loved being there and I love sharing my story with parents in the NICU. We found that it was really inspiring to them and it gave them a sense of hope when they were struggling.”  Foster said during the clinical rotation, she saw Weintraub’s natural affinity for the job. She’s proud of the woman and nurse Weintraub has become.  “She can really put parents at ease,” Foster said. “One time she shared her story with parents and they couldn’t believe it, that she had been born at 29 weeks and was premature but here she was.”  Morning Call reporter Leif Greiss can be reached at 610-679-4028 or lgreiss@mcall.com."

Mental health challenges can come unexpectedly and look different for everyone. They may appear at a time that is considered to be one of the happiest of your life, the birth of a baby. A new baby can bring big changes that cause a stir of emotions, from excitement to joy and fear to anxiety.  For one East Texas mother, the feelings were more severe and lasted longer.  “I really couldn’t do much. Like, I didn’t have much of a functioning capability, really, just to do day-to-day adult life things. They were hard,” a nurse at UT Health East Texas, Alyssa Brown, said. ” Eventually, I started having suicidal thoughts. Never tried to; never had a plan, necessarily, but I knew all of it was not normal.”  Brown gave birth to her baby while working as a nurse for UT Health East Texas in 2018. That’s around the time, she experienced postpartum depression.  Health officials say it can be mistaken for “baby blues,” but the symptoms are more intense and last longer. According to the C.D.C., one out of every eight new moms experience postpartum depression after giving birth.  For Brown, besides taking medication, she also decided to do therapy.  “I think therapy is what saved me for sure, what helped me just to learn,” Brown said. “How to think what I was thinking, you know, and how to process it and get past it.”  If you’re experiencing postpartum depression or if your “baby blues” don’t go away after two weeks, the C.D.C recommends getting in touch with your primary doctor.

An autopsy on the baby listed the cause and manner of the death as “undetermined,” according to a complaint warrant by the Scott County Sheriff’s Office.  Holtzclaw is accused of working alongside the juvenile, who is also charged in the case, to “conceal the child’s entire existence altogether, and/ or prevent the determination of whether it was born dead or alive,” according to the complaint.  Investigators wrote in the complaint that Holtzclaw and the juvenile admitted that they buried the baby in the backyard after birth between Dec. 5 and Dec. 6 of 2022.  The two are accused of attempting to bury the baby in a shoe box, but upon realizing the box wasn’t big enough they put the body in a plastic Dollar Tree shopping bag before burying it, according to the complaint.  Investigators allege that the actions of Holtzclaw and the juvenile contributed to the decomposition that prevented an autopsy from determining the baby’s cause of death, according to the complaint.  Holtzclaw is also accused of sending explicit videos to the juvenile he was in a “relationship” with and receiving explicit images in return, according to a separate complaint.  “Holtzclaw told investigators it was his opinion that it wasn’t right that he could legally have intercourse with the juvenile girlfriend, yet still be held accountable for having sexual performance imagery on his SnapChat or cellular device would get him into legal trouble,” an investigator wrote in the complaint warrant. “Holtzclaw told this investigator that we should change that law as in his opinion it was ‘not right.’”"

She told detectives she was unaware she was pregnant before giving birth, and that thought she was just getting sick. She said she didn't go to the hospital afterward because she was in the country illegally and didn't want to get in trouble. She also didn't have any money to pay the medical expenses. She admitted putting the infant's remains in the dumpster later that evening.

In a 6-1 decision, the Supreme Court blocked the Logan County Family Court from considering providing Kaidan Whitrock parenting time with an infant that is being adopted by a Van Wert County family selected by the birth mother. Whitrock lost his attempt to block the adoption when the Supreme Court decided in December 2022 that he waited too long to act after the adoption petition was filed.  The Court’s per curiam opinion noted that Whitrock sought the help of the Logan County court after the Van Wert County Probate Court would not allow him to participate in the adoption case when he requested to intervene. The Court wrote that instead of seeking help from another court, Whitrock could appeal the rejection of his right to intervene.  Chief Justice Sharon L. Kennedy and Justices R. Patrick DeWine, Michael P. Donnelly, Melody Stewart, Jennifer Brunner, and Joseph T. Deters joined the per curiam opinion. Justice Patrick F. Fischer dissented without a written opinion.  Click to Expand  Parenting Rights Considered After Adoption Request Submitted  Josephine Davis gave birth to a child identified in court records as “H.P.” in 2020. She was 17 years old at the time. Davis was not married to Whitrock, who was 18 years old, and presumed to be the child’s biological father. Whitrock’s paternity had not been established when H.P. was born.  To address paternity disputes, Ohio lawmakers established a Putative Father Registry in 1996 in R.C. 3107.061 et seq. Under this law, a father’s consent to the adoption of a minor child is not required unless the father registers with the putative father registry no later than 15 days after the child is born.  Three days after the birth of H.P., the married couple chosen by Davis filed a petition in the Van Wert County Probate Court to adopt the newborn baby. As the adoption request was pending, the probate court issued a placement order that granted the couple “care, custody, and control” over H.P., and Whitrock filed an objection to the adoption.  About two weeks after the adoption petition was filed, Whitrock asked Logan County Family Court Judge Natasha Kennedy to give parental rights and responsibilities to him, including authorizing genetic testing to determine paternity. While some counties have separate courts for matters dealing with children, the Logan County Family Court has combined jurisdiction over juvenile, domestic relations, and probate matters.  The genetic test results confirmed Whitrock is H.P.’s biological father. Judge Kennedy of Logan County stayed all action on Whitrock’s request for parental rights until after the Van Wert County probate court ruled in the H.P. adoption case. In January 2021, the Van Wert court denied Whitrock’s motion to intervene and ruled his consent was not required to grant the adoption.  Visitation Rights Case Resumed After Supreme Court Decision  Whitrock’s appeal of the Van Wert court’s decision to keep him out of the adoption case reached the Supreme Court in 2022. The Court remanded the matter to the Third District Court of Appeals, and in turn, the Third District remanded the case to the Van Wert probate court to consider whether Whitrock could claim his right to object to the adoption as the biological father of H.P.  The probate court is still considering the issue. As it does, Whitrock asked the Logan County Family Court to issue temporary orders granting him parenting time with H.P. and to move forward in determining if he should be granted custody.  H.P.’s mother and the adopting couple asked the Supreme Court for a writ of prohibition to prevent Judge Kennedy of Logan County from acting in the case. The mother and couple argued that the decisions regarding H.P. are solely to be made by the probate court in Van Wert.  Supreme Court Analyzed Roles of Multiple Courts in Adoption Cases  The per curiam opinion explains the Supreme Court must determine if the Logan County court is empowered to make decisions without interfering with the Van Wert court’s authority.  The Supreme Court explained that in general, only one court can have jurisdiction over a case at a time. In matters where it is possible that two or more courts could have the authority to consider a case, the general rule is the court that acts first is the one empowered to decide the case.  However, where two courts do not have the same powers the rule does not apply, the opinion stated. A probate court and a juvenile court have separate powers, and can both act, the opinion stated. Because the Logan County Family Court has the combined powers of three divisions, Judge Kennedy has some powers through her juvenile court responsibilities to “proceed with matters relevant to and in aid of the adoption proceedings,” the Supreme Court found.  Judge Kennedy has the power to determine the paternity of a child born out of wedlock and her finding that Whitrock was the biological father by use of genetic testing was not contested. However, the mother and the couple disputed Judge Kennedy’s right to decide matters beyond determining paternity, the opinion noted.  The Supreme Court ruled that the preadoption placement of H.P. with the couple was made by the Van Wert probate court. Once the probate court granted the placement, the probate court gained the exclusive right to determine the best interests of H.P.  Both the Logan County and Van Wert County courts contend they have the jurisdiction to determine the best interests of the child. The Supreme Court found any attempt by the Logan County court to grant visitation rights to Whitrock would be based on the assessment that it is in the best interest of H.P. By examining the best interests of H.P., the Logan County court is interfering with the Van Wert court’s right to determine the best interests of H.P., the opinion stated.  Any determination of whether Whitrock’s right to parenting time is in H.P.’s best interest is an issue that only the probate court in Van Wert can consider, the Court ruled.  In response to the mother and adopting couple’s attempt to prohibit her from acting, the Logan County judge argued that she must make the decision to consider Whitrock’s rights because the probate court denied Whitrock’s right to intervene and participate in the placement case.  The Supreme Court ruled that the Van Wert probate court’s decision to deny Whitrock’s participation does not create a right for the Logan Count Family Court to act on the matter. Whitrock instead should address his objections through the probate court, and any rights he has to appeal that court’s decisions, the Supreme Court concluded.  2022-0232. State ex rel. Davis v.

Chennai Super Kings on the brink of playoff qualification  Talking about his side’s performances in the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL) 2023, Chennai Super Kings have been doing quite well for themselves. Currently, they find themselves in second place in the standings with 15 points from 13 matches.  Having won seven matches, lost five, and one deemed no result, the four-time champions are on the brink of qualifying for the knockout stages of the tournament.  With just one game left in the group stage for Chennai, the MS Dhoni-led side would look to finish the proceedings on a winning note and make their way to the playoffs. They take on the David Warner-led Delhi Capitals next in the 67th game of the tournament on Saturday, May 20 at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in Delhi.  It is to be noted that Delhi became the first side to be eliminated from the competition after their recent loss to Punjab Kings on May 13. However, this could prove dangerous for Chennai, as Delhi would come into the game with nothing to lose.  The last time both sides faced each other, it resulted in a win for the four-time champions, and the side would hope that the same could be the case this time around as well.      "

She said, “With this pregnancy — Unfortunately due to an issue with my placenta I’m not able to try for a VBAC with this pregnancy. It’s a totally different issue that what l had with Gates. His was an emergency c-section, but this one we knew right away once I had my anatomy scan that a vbac was not a safe option for me or the baby.”  Raven concluded her post by writing, “With that being said, I think mothers who want an elected c-section should not be shamed, and we should just wish the best on any birth plan/decisions a mom makes. Whether she chose it or it was chosen for her.”  Couldn’t agree more, and we’re sending the entire Gottschalk family our love."

(Source: Getty)  More than half of Ausssie parents were inclined to choose the public system when giving birth, according to new research by Finder .  According to Finder’s Parenting Report 2023, which surveyed 1,033 Australian parents of children under 12, 62 per cent said they would go through the public system if they were to have another child.  The research found one in four would go the private route, while one in 10 were on the fence.  Those who have previously gone with private healthcare paid, on average, more than three times as much in out-of-pocket fees ($2,394) than those who took the public path ($726).  Finder health insurance expert James Martin said the decision to have a child was one of life’s most significant milestones, and everyone had their own preferences when choosing to give birth.  “It really depends on personal circumstances but cost and choice are usually the two determining factors when choosing between a public or private birth,” Martin said.  “Some say the main advantage of going private for childbirth is that you can access a more individual level of care. This includes having your own room where your partner can remain at your side throughout your stay in the hospital.  “On the other hand, while you’re guaranteed your own obstetrician, the medical professionals are just as qualified in the public sector as they are in the private sector.”  Why parents said they would choose public  While cost was the number one reason for almost half (46 per cent) who said they would go public, almost two in five said the quality of treatment and care was just as good as going private.  Flexibility around seeing a different medical team (7 per cent) and not choosing an obstetrician (6 per cent) were other reasons some chose to stick with the public system.  Story continues  Why parents said they would choose private  On the other end of the spectrum, 16 per cent of those who said they would go private said it was down to better quality treatment and care.  The ability to choose an obstetrician (15 per cent) and access to a private room (15 per cent) were other determining factors.  Martin said a major difference between the two was the out-of-pocket fees.  “The cost of childbirth in a private hospital is far greater than in the public system, where it’s typically free under Medicare,” he said.  Martin said it was important to account for the costs involved in the private system.  “For one, you’ll need to pay more while you see out your insurance policy’s waiting period. For most, this means at least 12 months of higher premiums while holding a Gold health insurance policy that covers childbirth.  “Your total costs can run into several thousand dollars once you factor in out-of-pocket costs.  “These can include payments for physio visits, antenatal classes and lactation consultant appointments. Plus, you’ll need to pay your policy’s excess when making a claim at the private hospital.”  Follow Yahoo Finance on Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram and Twitter, and subscribe to our free daily newsletter."

Even in the 15 states that gained children, all but North Dakota experienced greater growth in the adult population, meaning children now make up a lower percentage of residents.  In states where the number of children has declined, school officials are facing the possibility of teacher layoffs or even school closures when pandemic aid expires next year. A decline in school enrollment could provide short-term cost savings and might be a benefit to children if there are more resources to go around, but it bodes poorly for future state workforces.  In states where the drop in the number of children is part of a broader population decline, there will be additional fiscal, economic and political ramifications, such as diminished representation in Congress.  The states with the largest drops were California, Illinois and New Mexico, where the child population declined by 6 percent between 2017 and 2022, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data. Idaho and North Dakota saw the largest increases, at 4 percent.  The declines mostly are a reflection of historically low fertility rates, which have been below the replacement rate of two children per woman since 2010. Births increased in only a handful of states in 2021.  But in the 35 states that experienced declines, high housing prices also are a factor. In California, jobs pay well but the state's housing shortage has sent prices beyond the means of young families, said Hans Johnson, a senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California, a nonpartisan think tank.  ""People want to buy a house and have children, but they realize they can't do it here so they look in the vicinity, states close by, and work remotely so they can keep their California paychecks,"" Johnson said.  Slow population growth cost California a seat in Congress after the 2020 census. The number of adults in California grew in the past five years, according to the Stateline analysis, but the decline in the number of children led to a lower overall population.  California also has experienced a phenomenon shared by other Western states: The children of Hispanic immigrants have lower birth rates than their parents. California's total fertility rate dropped from 2.15 per woman in 2008 to a historic low of 1.52 in 2020, the lowest since records have been kept, Johnson wrote in a January report.  California, Illinois and New Mexico all have seen lower school enrollment in recent years, even as they've tried to rekindle interest in public education after pandemic upheavals.  In New Mexico, enrollment has dropped particularly sharply in the northwestern part of the state, where there are many Indigenous students, according to a January state report. Between 2012-2022, enrollment declined by 22 percent in the majority-Native Central Consolidated Schools in San Juan County, compared with a statewide decline of 7 percent, according to the report. Indigenous and other children in the mostly rural area struggle to stay in school because of long bus commutes and lack of internet access at home.  The recent closure of a coal mine and the power generating station it fueled forced many families with children to move away from San Juan County to find jobs, according to Central Consolidated school board President Christina Aspaas.  ""A lot of Navajo workers who were employed had to relocate to Phoenix or elsewhere out of state to earn the same wages,"" Aspaas said. ""It affected the local tribes, Hopi and Navajo, Diné. Seeing the impacts makes my heart break. These are all my children, and they deserve the best in education and in life.""  In Idaho and North Dakota, annual school enrollment has increased over the past five years, except for temporary drops early in the pandemic. But Idaho is bracing for a decline starting in 2025, when children from a historic 2007 baby boom in the state start turning 18.  Idaho has become known as a picturesque and affordable place to raise children, said Jaap Vos, a planning professor at the University of Idaho in Boise. He relocated from Florida with his 3-year-old son in 2012, ""when it was still the middle of nowhere,"" he said. The number of adults in the state grew by 16 percent during the same period.  Boise is getting a lot of new residents from California, and northern Idaho is seeing more movers from Northern California, Washington and Utah. ""It might be for ideological reasons, people looking for a more conservative lifestyle,"" Vos said. He added that some people have left Boise as it has grown more crowded.  Even in northern Idaho, housing prices have risen rapidly.  Writer Leah Hampton is moving from North Carolina to Moscow in northern Idaho to teach at the University of Idaho. But she said she is having trouble finding an affordable house -- even without children. Her husband is working remotely.  ""Moscow is definitely a great place to raise kids. It's like a 1950s movie up here but more diverse and left wing,"" Hampton said. ""All of my friends' children seem really happy and well-adjusted. But cost of living is much higher than we expected. We have money, and we literally can't find anything to buy.""  Many houses are sold sight unseen to investors offering cash, she said.  Another fast-growing state with meager growth in the number of children is Florida, where a decrease in births and an increase in deaths over the past five years has created a negative drag on overall population, according to census estimates. The state had almost 25,000 more births than deaths in 2017, but there were 40,000 more deaths than births by 2022.  Still, Florida had the third-highest increase in child population between 2017 and 2022, at 2 percent. One reason: Hispanic births in Florida have continued to increase, unlike in Western states, said Stefan Rayer, director of the population program at the state Bureau of Economic and Business Research. In fact, births are increasing for white, Black and Hispanic mothers in Florida, helping to offset some of the increasing deaths among the white population, Rayer said.  ""Unless births increase substantially, because of the aging of Florida's population, the state will likely see natural decrease for the foreseeable future, with all growth coming from migration,"" Rayer said.

Matthew Herbert shared photos on Twitter on Saturday (13 May) announcing the birth of his son Finn, saying, “he is just perfect”, and that “everyone is super happy and healthy”.  “Finn arrived literally into my hands with just four pushes at 3:03am on the 13 of May following 18 hours (!!!) of labour contractions,” he wrote.  “Finn has filled a hole in our hearts we didn’t even know existed”  Despite Herbert’s beautiful post celebrating the birth of his child, his post was viciously attacked by trolls, mostly due to his choice to have Finn through a surrogate, something which many people – straight, LGBTQ+, single, married – choose to do, including celebrities like Kim Kardashian.  “Oof. I had no idea surrogacy and adoption were so controversial before reading this … people need to mind their own,” a supportive commenter posted on Twitter.  But many social media users with paid-for blue ticks attacked his post and his new role as a father.  “This baby needs a mother, not you”, “Who suffered the labour contractions?”, “Return that poor baby to the mother” and “This is wrong on so many levels” were just some of the comments left under his photos.  Twitter, he is just perfect.  Finn arrived literally into my hands with just 4 pushes at 3:03am on the 13th of May following 18 hours (!!!) of labour contractions.  Everyone is super happy and healthy.    Finn has filled a hole in our hearts we didn’t even know existed 🥰🥰 pic.twitter.com/YOCCyJU229 — Matthew Herbert (@m_herbert) May 13, 2023  Hitting back at trolls, Herbert explained: “Reading the replies and unsolicited DMs has reminded me how much hate there is in this world, and how there are people who don’t want us and baby Finn to succeed in this world.  “Fear not, it’s all water off a duck’s back for us … but it won’t always be for Finn as he grows.  “Finn is surrounded by more love than could ever be measured.”  He added that he will be protecting the privacy of his baby’s birth mother, who will be a “huge part of our lives forever” and “chose us just as much as we chose her”.  Herbert pointed out to trolls who had attacked him choosing surrogacy, implying he had “purchased” his baby, that “commercial” surrogacy is illegal in New Zealand, therefore surrogates choose to carry the baby for altruistic reasons rather than being paid to do so.  Reading the replies and unsolicited DMs has reminded me how much hate there is in this world, and how there are people who don’t want us and baby Finn to succeed in this world.    Fear not, it’s all water off a ducks back for us.  But it won’t always be for Finn as he grows. 1/ pic.twitter.com/fRimsBNeg9 — Matthew Herbert (@m_herbert) May 15, 2023  In the UK, recommendations have been made for “major changes” to surrogacy law to make things easier for intended parents.  In a review commissioned by the government, the Law Commission of England and Wales and the Scottish Law Commission proposed a new pathway to legal parenthood that would mean intended parents have parental rights from birth.  Currently, intended parents must wait to obtain a court order in order to gain parental rights, which should take six weeks, but in reality can be much longer.  Under the proposals, intended parents would have those rights from birth – though the surrogate would be able to withdraw their consent and assert parental rights until six weeks after birth.  Father and surrogacy advocate Michael Johnson-Ellis “welcomed” the reforms, describing them as a “big win”.  “What it is doing is certainly providing equitable access to parenthood from birth, and that was something that obviously never existed previously,” Johnson-Ellis told PinkNews in March.  “The full report definitely shows more balance with between LGBTQ+ and heterosexual intended parents.”  Just as in New Zealand, paid-for surrogacy is illegal in the UK."

Mikaela and Matt Bennett were pregnant with twins. Mikalea was born with a rare disease that she did not know about, as symptoms did not show until she was pregnant. When she began to get nose bleeds and her legs swelled, they went to the hospital.  On Dec. 21, 2022, she was admitted to the hospital at 24 weeks pregnant with a rare condition known as HHT with AVMs. HHT causes some blood vessels to not develop properly, including the possibility of some not forming with capillaries. AVM stands for arteriovenous malformation, where an abnormal connection is formed between the arteries and the veins. This is usually present in the brain and the spine and present at birth. If AVMs rupture it can cause bleeding in the brain and spinal cords.  “In December the hospital detected it in her own body,” Matt Bennett’s aunt Karin McAdoo said. “It went undetected until she was pregnant with the twins. They also detected an embolism in her lungs which was bleeding, and a lot of other complications.”  After seeing many different types of specialists and baby doctors, McAdoo said Mikaela had an emergency C-Section at 30 weeks pregnant. She gave birth to a boy and a girl — Madalynn and Myles on Feb. 1. McAdoo said Mikaela was not able to see or hold them and they had to be immediately transferred to a different hospital, as they both had AVMs detected as well. The baby girl passed away four days later, but Myles Bennett is still here. McAdoo said Madalynn passed away at a different hospital than the one Mikaela was at, and that Mikaela never got to hold her daughter while she was alive.  “During the C-Section Mikaela coded, but was brought back,” McAdoo said. “Myles has AVMs on his brain. He may end up needing a liver transplant, which is scary for a baby. That’s not something they can do until he is six months old. He is only three months old now.”  The Bennetts have come home since the birth, but have had to travel back and forth to the hospital in Pittsburgh for appointments. McAdoo said at least three different hospitals have been involved in this situation. Matt Bennett did not work from Dec. 21 when they went to the hospital to April 12 when they were released. He had to ask his job to be able to come back, and the only income during that time was donations from people.  The spaghetti dinner — put on by the organization Brother’s By Choice — will be held on Sunday, May 21 from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. at the Celoron Legion, Herman Kent Post 777, 23 Jackson Ave., Jamestown. The price for the dinner is $10, and children five and under are free. Besides the dinner there will be a DJ, bake sale, and basket giveaway.  “We’ve had some amazing donations,” McAdoo said. “We’ve had a queen mattress set donated from Jamestown Mattress. There’s the bake sale, and a lot of other donations, including a grill. There’s a lot of nice stuff.”  Gift certificates and baskets will also be available.  A Go Fund Me for the Bennett family can be found at https://www.gofundme.com/f/cxb357-the-bennett-family.  McAdoo said while there is a long road ahead, the family has been staying strong during this hard time.  “They are an amazing family,” McAdoo said. “They are strong. Their faith has kept them going.”"

Fundal height measures the distance between the top of the uterus and the pelvic bone in a pregnant person. It determines if your baby is growing as expected and confirms gestational age (how far along you are in pregnancy). It can also assess where the baby is in the uterus.    This article discusses fundal height, including what it is, when it's used, and what the measurements mean during pregnancy.  BSIP / Getty Images  Fundal Height Defined  Fundal height is a simple screening tool your healthcare provider uses to monitor your baby’s growth and development. It is measured in centimeters and is often first taken at prenatal appointments starting at 20 weeks of pregnancy. The fundal height measurement in centimeters should be close to the fetus’s gestational age in weeks. For example, if you are 27 weeks pregnant, your fundal height should be about 27 centimeters (give or take 2 centimeters).  A fundal height that is too small or too large could indicate a pregnancy complication. If your fundal height is out of the norm, your healthcare provider will recommend an ultrasound. People with high-risk pregnancies often require more ultrasounds as well.  Fundal height is an imprecise measurement, and some factors can affect it. For instance, fundal height may be more challenging to measure in pregnant people who have a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher. Having a history of uterine fibroids may also affect the accuracy of fundal height.  What Is Average Fundal Height? Average fundal height in centimeters usually is the same numeral as the fetus's gestational age in weeks. For example, if you are 32 weeks pregnant, your fundal height will likely be 32 centimeters.    How Fundal Height Measurements Work  Fundal height can be measured quickly and easily. Your healthcare provider will ask you to lie down face up on the exam table, similar to when you have an ultrasound or pelvic exam.  Your provider will then run a soft tape measure from the area of your belly where the top of your uterus would be down to your pubic bone.  After 20 weeks of pregnancy, your fundal height will likely be measured at each appointment. Before 20 weeks, an ultrasound exam estimates your baby’s gestational age. If your fundal height measurement is higher or lower than expected, your provider will likely remeasure you and then refer you for an ultrasound.    What Are Fundal Height Measurements Used For?  Measuring fundal height is used to monitor fetal growth and development. Several factors can affect how a fetus develops during pregnancy. Fundal height is a simple way to detect potential growth issues or complications.  If your fundal height is low, your baby may not be growing as expected. If your fundal height is high, your baby may grow faster than expected. When your fundal height measurement is below or above average, your healthcare provider will recommend an ultrasound to confirm the finding and determine the cause.  Genetics, nutrition, infection, environmental exposures, and the pregnant person’s overall health influence fetal size and growth.  Small for Gestational Age  ""Small for gestational age"" is a term that refers to a fetus that is smaller or less developed than usual. This is also referred to as intrauterine growth restriction. Babies with a birth weight below the 10th percentile are considered small for gestational age.  If your fundal height is smaller than expected, your baby may be small for gestational age. It is also possible that you are not as far along in pregnancy as previously estimated.  Possible causes of being small for gestational age include:  Genetic conditions  Metabolic diseases (medical conditions caused by a genetic defect)  Chromosome anomalies (a change in a baby's DNA that alters development before birth)  Multiple pregnancy (twins, triplets, etc.)  Infants who are small for gestational age are at higher risk of experiencing:  High red blood cell count  Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)  Low body temperature  Meconium aspiration (when a newborn breathes meconium or stool and amniotic fluid into the lungs)  (when a newborn breathes meconium or stool and amniotic fluid into the lungs) Neurological injury    Large for Gestational Age  ""Large for gestational age"" is a term referring to a fetus larger or more developed than average. Babies with a birth weight above the 90th percentile are considered large for gestational age.  If your fundal height exceeds the average, your baby may be large for gestational age. You may also be further along in pregnancy than previously estimated.  Possible causes of large gestational age include:  Gestational diabetes  Maternal obesity  Excessive pregnancy weight gain  Babies who are born large for gestational age are at a higher risk of experiencing:  An injury during childbirth  Shoulder dystocia (when a baby's shoulders get stuck during delivery)  Low blood sugar after delivery  Neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission  Risks and Warnings  A fundal height measurement is a noninvasive tool. There is no risk associated with this exam. It is important to note that fundal height is not always accurate and may vary depending on the healthcare provider’s technique, the pregnant person’s weight gain, and other factors.  For this reason, it is important to verify any abnormal findings with an ultrasound immediately. Research estimates that 75% to 90% of fetal growth abnormalities go undiagnosed until birth.  Summary  Fundal height is a measurement taken during pregnancy to monitor fetal growth. Fundal height measures the distance between the pelvic bone and the top of the uterus in a pregnant person. It determines if your baby is growing as expected.  Fundal height is measured in centimeters and is usually started around 20 weeks of pregnancy. It may be used to assess your baby for small or gestational age (SGA) or large for gestational age (LGA). If your measurement is abnormal, your provider will recommend an ultrasound exam.  "

A BBC Newsnight investigation has found scammers are using Facebook to find willing participants and claim to have “helped” thousands of women with the move, which helps the child to get UK citizenship and the mother a residency route.  Facebook told the BBC such content was banned by its rules.  A BBC researcher went undercover, posing as a pregnant woman who was in the UK illegally, and spoke to people offering the services.  One agent, who went by the name Thai, told her he had a number of British men who could act as fake fathers and offered a “full package” for £11,000.  He introduced the undercover researcher to a British man called Andrew, who he said would pose as a father and would be paid £8,000 from the total fee, the BBC reports.  A child is automatically British by birth if a migrant woman is in the UK illegally but gives birth to a child fathered by a British citizen or a man with indefinite leave to remain.  The mother can then apply for a family visa, which will give her the right to remain in the UK and apply for citizenship in due course.  Last year, 4,860 family visas were granted to “other dependants”, a category that includes those applying to stay in the UK as parents of British children.  Deliberately giving false details on a birth certificate is a criminal offence.  The Home Office told the BBC it had measures in place to prevent and detect immigration fraud using false birth certificates.  The BBC was told that the practice occurred in many different migrant communities including those from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nigeria and Sri Lanka, and had been happening for many years.  The investigation found that the illegal practice was advertised widely on some Vietnamese Facebook groups for jobseekers.  Meta, the company that owns Facebook, told the BBC it did not allow “the solicitation of adoptions or birth certificate fraud on Facebook”. It said it would continue to remove content that violated its policies."

Citing preliminary data from its Vital Statistics Report, the PSA said births last year totaled 1.25 million, declining by 8.2% from 1.36 million tallied in 2021.  The Calabarzon (Cavite-Laguna-Batangas-Rizal-Quezon) Region had the highest registration of birth, accounting for 15.6% or 195,795 of all births nationwide.  This was followed by Central Luzon with a 12% share (149,939) and capital region Metro Manila’s 10.1% (126,471).  However, Calabarzon’s birth tally last year was lower by 4.2% annually compared with 204,333 in 2021. Registered births in the National Capital Region (NCR) also contracted by 21.4%.  Preliminary vital statistics data from the PSA showed deaths from January to December reached 622,509, falling by 29.2% from 879,429 in 2021.  Calabarzon also accounted for the highest registered deaths with 15.1% of the total deaths last year at 94,084. This was lower by 32% from 138,298 recorded in 2021.  It was followed by Central Luzon with a 12.1% share at 75,397, and NCR with 11.4% at 70,801.  Meanwhile, registered marriages climbed by 12.5% year on year to 401,388 last year from 356,839 in 2021.  Calabarzon had the highest share of registered marriages at 15.2% with 60,831, followed by Central Luzon, 11.8% share or 47,273 and NCR’s 11.8% or 47,245.  The information in the vital statistics report was compiled from tallies generated by city or municipal Civil Registrars during the period, consolidated by the PSA’s Provincial Statistical Offices and then submitted to the Office of the Civil Registrar General as of Feb. 28.  CAUSES OF DEATH  In a separate report, the PSA said that ischemic heart diseases were the leading cause of deaths in the country with 114,557 cases in 2022. This is equivalent to 18.4% of the 622,509 total deaths listed in the January to December period.  Neoplasms diseases were the second-highest cause of death with 63,377 (10.2% share), followed by cerebrovascular diseases with 63,281 (10.2% share).  Meanwhile, deaths due to COVID-19 totaled 17,011 in 2022, declining by 84.9% from the 112,772 deaths registered in 2021.  Deaths associated with COVID-19 are classified into those with the virus identified and not identified at the time of death.  COVID-19 with virus identified accounted for 12,085 or 1.9% of total deaths. Taken by itself, this category would be the 11th leading cause of death during the period.  Some 4,926 deaths due to COVID-19 fell into the “virus not identified” category, accounting for 0.8% of total deaths, or 23rd overall.  According to the PSA, data on COVID-19 deaths were based on death certificates received and certified by health officers of local government units. — Lourdes O. Pilar"

I’m Kaitlyn, and I’m one of the new members of the Gorilla Care Team. While I’m one of the newest humans on the team, I am not the newest addition in the gorilla building. I’m so excited to be sharing about the newest member of our gorilla family, Willie B. III, and how his family is responding to his arrival.  We welcomed the first baby of parents Shalia and Willie B., Jr., on April 24, and I can certainly say there is no better way to begin a new job. The Gorilla Care Team was pleasantly surprised by his arrival, as we were expecting him to make his debut in May. Shalia made childbirth look like a walk in the park! She was not only calm, cool, and collected all morning preceding his birth, but also remained that way throughout the day and gave birth with no complications, surrounded by her troop. As a new mom myself, I was in awe at her resilience and natural ability. Gorillas really are some of the most amazing animals.  Shalia isn’t new at motherhood, as this is her second baby, but for the rest of her troop, these are uncharted waters. New father Willie B., Jr. has remained cautiously interested in the small bundle that never leaves Shalia’s arms – something many new fathers can relate to. At first, the new dad was hesitant to be in the same space as the infant and would observe only at a distance. Recently, however, we have noticed him observing from much closer and even appearing to lean in and gaze directly at the baby. This of course has caused many happy tears and squeaks of joy from the humans on the team. It’s momentous to experience Willie B., Jr.’s journey into fatherhood, not only because he’s a favorite of most of his care team, but also because of the legacy the birth of his son continues.  You may be wondering how “aunties” Kambera and Amari are reacting. This birth is important for many reasons, but one of them is the opportunity for the other girls to experience infant rearing. Motherhood is hard enough without having to learn on the job, so for gorilla troops, it’s important for females to be able to gain experience from watching their mothers and troop members raise babies. We are hoping that Kambera especially shows interest in Willie B., III, so she can learn from supermom Shalia and will be ready to care for her own infant when the time comes. Amari was immediately interested in the baby and began following Shalia around on day one. She can often be found peering over Shalia’s shoulder and watching as the baby sleeps or nurses. Mom is very tolerant of Amari’s interest, but will gently redirect her if Amari comes too close. Kambera didn’t show much interest to begin with, but she has recently began sitting closer to Shalia and sneaking peeks at the baby when she thinks no one is watching her. She can pretend not to think Willie B., III is the cutest thing she’s ever seen, but we all know you love him too, Kambera!  Keep an eye out for more updates on our newest family group as we continue to watch them all adjust to this new life. Stop by Gorilla Habitat 4 on your next visit and you’ll be sure to spot proud mom Shalia cradling her bundle of joy.  Kaitlyn K.  Keeper II, Primates"

Thank you for turning to WORLD Radio to help start your day. Good morning. I’m Mary Reichard.  NICK EICHER, HOST: And I’m Nick Eicher. Coming next on The World and Everything in It: adoption law and ethics.  Today, we launched Episode 5 of Effective Compassion. It tells the story of adoption from a legal perspective, circumstances where a child is removed from a home because of abuse or neglect and permanently placed with another family. That’s when a judge gets involved to help decide what’s best for the child.  REICHARD: But what about adoption by choice? When birth parents voluntarily place a child for adoption? The courts don’t typically get involved in those situations. But lawyers do. Today, WORLD reporter Jenny Rough talks with an adoption attorney who has dedicated her life to walking families through the process.  JENNY ROUGH, REPORTER: In 1883, a Christian businessman from New York opened the first Florence Crittenton home. He wanted to provide shelter for unwed pregnant women, and share the gospel with them. In the decades that followed, Crittenton homes spread to major cities across the country.  BARBARA JONES: You know, back in those days, they would whisk the girls away from school or wherever. It was kind of shameful if she was pregnant before she was married.    Barbara Jones lives in Clifton, Virginia. Her home is located on a former Crittenton farm. The pregnant women lived in a dormer home on the back of the property.  JONES: And they planted in the garden, and they actually worked on the farm. And then, after the babies were born, they went back to their life.    The babies were adopted. It’s fitting that Jones lives there now. She works as an adoption attorney.  JONES: It is a boutique specialty. I gravitated into it very quickly after I obtained my law license and just fell in love with it because it’s family oriented.    In the greeting area of her office, every wall is covered with photos.  ROUGH: Are these all the babies?    JONES: No, they’re some of them. The reason is now people do digital pictures.  Depending on the case, Jones works with birth parents and adoptive parents.  JONES: Representing a birth parent is painful, because there’s sorrow in separating from her baby, probably the hardest thing she’ll ever do. Representing adoptive parents, high anxiety, but great joy when they’re placed.    A stack of old newspapers sits on her conference table. Thirty-five years ago, when Jones first started practicing adoption law, matches were made through the classifieds 1-800 numbers.  JONES: Here’s a classified ad. Virginian-Pilot. Come to adoption. Sam and Sue wish to adopt healthy newborn child. Will pay legal, uninsured medical.    Now, those who hope to adopt advertise online. Either directly through word-of-mouth networking, or through an agency.  Adoption lawyers like Jones advise birth mothers of the law and help them think through what they want.  JONES: She can complete a hospital plan. A nursery consent, stating who could come into the nursery and hold and feed her baby. Who she wants in the delivery room. Does she want pictures?    She also helps birth moms fill out forms for medical history, family history, social history. Authorization releases and oaths that affirm the information is true.  One of Jones’ most important duties: helping the birth mom obtain the consent of the birth father. This can be harder than it sounds.  JONES: “I was drunk at a party,” we hear way too much. Sometimes there are girls prostituting or sex trafficking.    Jones has encountered many cases where the birth father is unknown.  JONES: And if a mother says, “I don’t know who he was. He said his name was Dave or Tripp,” You know how many Daves there are in Virginia?    State laws vary. But today, over 35 states, including Virginia, have a system in place to help track down fathers.  JONES: We implemented the birth father registry so we didn’t have to chase men in dark alleys at night, and we could say, “Hey, we’re representing Susie Smith. Step up now.” We want to protect fathers if they want to parent, but they need to step up in the window of time.    Adoptive parents also have a lot of paperwork. Most notably, a home study. An intensive process that involves everything from a criminal records check to biographical history.  So that’s the law of adoption. But what about ethics? Adoption scams are becoming more common. Historically, it was considered ethical for hopeful adoptive parents to cover some expenses for the birth mom—medical and pregnancy-related expenses, like maternity clothes. But in some states, it’s now the norm for adoptive parents to cover living expenses for the birth mom. Thousands of dollars a month.  JONES: Often I'll get a call from some of the states in the west and they'll say, well, what is your birth mom's budget? If she comes in here and it’s all about money.    Jones’ antenna goes up! The practice can be coercive on both ends. The pregnant woman might feel coerced to give up her child, even if she wants to legitimately change her mind, if the adoptive parents have been sending money. And adoptive parents may feel coerced to keep paying lest the birth mom go off and find someone else. Some states have implemented laws to guard against that.  JONES: Virginia is very restrictive. You can pay living expenses for the birth mom, but only if her doctor writes a note and says she cannot work due to medical complications or reasons of the pregnancy.    Finally, Jones draws up post-adoption contracts. An agreement between the parties to stay in touch through letters, pictures, and visits.  JONES: Oftentimes the birth parents like that. They know they picked a good family, they like them, but they’re just so afraid they’ll separate and that family will forget them. We will type it up, and we put the terms that the parties have agreed. They might do two visits a year. Birth parents may send gifts. The adoptive parents will send videos and pictures, whatever they agree upon.    Birth mothers do have time to change their minds. How long again, varies by state. Maryland is one the longest at 30 days.  JONES: And then in Virginia she has 7 days to revoke.  ROUGH: Okay.  JONES: No matter what. It’s a very small percentage that change their mind after the mom goes home and the baby goes out the door with the agency or the family.    When the time period to revoke passes, the child is adopted, welcomed into a new family, with the family’s full name, identity, and rights.  To this day, Jones tries to carry on the history of her property as a safe haven.  JONES: There’s peace in this place, and I know there was much prayer that went on here. And sometimes my clients will come in and say, “This place is so peaceful.” And I just feel like the Lord was here ahead of time.  Reporting for WORLD, I’m Jenny Rough in Clifton, Virginia.

What You Need To Know Clearwater residents Kaitlyn and Tim McCallum began to notice a shell-like growth on back of their newborn son, James    A pediatric dermatologist in Orlando diagnosed James with giant congenital melanocytic nevus    Doctors have completed the removal process and now they’ve started a series of procedures to replace the bad skin with good skin      View photos of James' journey below  Kaitlyn delivered James in August, 2021. When he came out, there was a scabby growth on his back.  “(It was) terrifying, to say the least,” Kaitlyn said. “Right when he was born, it was pretty flat. There was a bump by his neck, there was a lump.”  “That’s kind of concerning, when you have medical professionals and they’re telling you they’ve never seen this before,” said Tim, who said doctors were initially puzzled.  As the McCallum parents searched for answers, struggling with the uncertainty, the growth increased in size, becoming lumpier and fattier. The spots grew darker, the texture became fleshier and the exterior grew hairier.  The growth began to resemble a turtle shell, with Kaitlyn and Tim adopting the nickname of “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle” for their toddler.  “We try to give him any superhero nickname, because that’s what he is to us,” Kaitlyn said.  Unfortunately, the shell-like growth also began to hinder James’ life. He couldn’t sleep on his back, which is a safe sleep practice for babies, and his head and neck movement became more and more restricted.  Finally, a pediatric dermatologist in Orlando offered a diagnosis: A giant congenital melanocytic nevus.  It’s a large patch of skin, often described as a mole or a birthmark, which presents at birth or develops in a baby’s first year. It is usually not harmful, though it can develop into cancer or become dangerous if it reaches the brain or spine. Thankfully, in James’ case, it was cumbersome, but harmless.  “Getting that diagnosis of ‘Okay, here is what It is, here’s who you can go to, here’s how we’re going to fix it,’ that was the moment of, ‘Okay, we can do this,’” Kaitlyn said.  Doctors began the removal process when James was six months old, starting with the lump by his neck and then moving down his back to remove the bulk of the shell. Now, they’ve started a series of procedures to remove the bad skin and replace it with good skin. A specialist at the University of Chicago is spearheading that work.  When it’s all over, doctors hope James will be left with nothing more than a scar. His parents know their turtle-shell hero will have a story to tell and they’ll look back on the strength it took for all of them to endure this birth surprise.  “I’ve learned how strong you can be and how much a mother can do for a kid,” Kaitlyn said. “Just keep staying strong. There’s an end to this and we’re almost there.”"

Thurza Blagg, from Nottingham, was rushed to hospital when she began bleeding whilst on holiday on the Greek island.  The 32-year-old, who is 28 weeks pregnant, is desperate to return home where she feels she can give birth safely. However, Ms Blagg says her insurance company AXA missed a chance to repatriate her, resulting instead in an urgent transfer to Alexandra hospital in Athens.  She said due to the language barrier and receiving little support, she does not understand what is happening with her baby. ""I don't feel very safe, I don't feel like I've got a clear birth plan,"" she said.  The UK government said it was supporting Ms Blagg and is in contact with local authorities. AXA has stated it was crucial to ensure any decision made was the right one and, after carefully reviewing her case, it is providing her with the medical assistance she needs.  On May 6, Ms Blagg went to Rhodes with her mum Kim, who was celebrating her 60th birthday.  Ms Blagg said it was an attempt to ""get away from it all"" after her partner - and dad to her unborn baby - Paul Ahad took his own life in January. ""This baby that I'm carrying now is really important because it's the only piece of my partner I've got left,"" she said.  She received a fit-to-fly letter ahead of her trip, but on May 12, just two days before she was due to return, she began bleeding. After being rushed to Rhodes General Hospital, Ms Blagg was told her waters had broke. She was given medication to delay the birth and contacted AXA so she could arrange a flight home.  Due to it being the weekend the insurance company were unable to acquire the necessary information from her GP. Instead, in a letter seen by Nottinghamshire Live, it said Ms Blagg could sign a medical disclaimer saying she would be liable for payment if she did not ""fall within the terms of your policy"".  However, after sending the signed documentation, Ms Blagg said AXA failed to organise her flight before the decision was made to move her to Athens. ""I should've been sent home but they basically ignored that,"" she said.  ""They left me in a hospital for 12 hours without neonatal facilities. Time was running out and a decision had to be made.  ""There was an opportunity for me to return home to receive the appropriate care. I did everything they asked, it isn't about money, I want my baby to be alive, healthy and safe. I'm scared and I want to go home and understand what's happening to my baby.  ""It's not like the UK here, it's hard to understand what my condition is. There is a massive language barrier, when they're saying medical terms and I'm carrying my first full term pregnancy, it's hard to understand what's going on.  ""I don't feel very safe, I don't feel like I've got a clear birth plan. They're changing my sheets today for the first time, I haven't been offered any food or water, my mum has to buy it all.""  She added that she was assessed in plain view of other patients and their visitors. ""People's boyfriends could be there and staff will rip off my pants to have a look at me, there's no curtain or privacy. I feel highly vulnerable.""  Ms Blagg is still in contact with AXA and the British Embassy, who she hopes will help her return to the UK. ""It's mine and Paul's baby, it's all I've got left of Paul,"" she said. ""I feel pressurised and I don't feel safe.""  Her mum, Kim, who has remained by her side throughout, said: ""It's been disgusting, shocking and frightening. It's been an awful ordeal and because of there being limited visiting hours I've had to fight to stay in the room with her. We've had no support whatsoever, the insurance company has been terrible.""  A spokesperson for the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said: “We are supporting a British woman hospitalised in Greece and are in contact with the local authorities.”  An AXA Partners spokesperson said:“We are very sorry to hear about Ms Blagg’s circumstances and we sympathise with her situation. Due to the complex nature of her condition, we have a duty of care to ensure any decision we take is in her best interest.  ""Therefore, it was essential for our medical team to obtain and review Ms Blagg’s full medical history in order to determine the appropriate next steps to ensure she receives the right level of care. Following a review of this information, we will provide her with the medical assistance she requires.”"

Christina Ricci and her husband Mark Hampton tend to keep their family life pretty private, but occasionally share rare glimpses into their roles as parents.  The Casper actress shares son Freddie with ex-husband James Heerdegen. The then-couple welcomed son Freddie in 2014, nearly a year after tying the knot. Ricci filed for divorce from the dolly grip in July 2020; in January 2021, Us Weekly confirmed that a judge ordered Heerdegen to stay 100 yards away from the actress after she accused him of domestic violence. Heerdegen was also stripped of his visitation rights with their son.  Following the duo’s split, Ricci moved on with Hampton in July 2021. In August 2021, the twosome shared that they were expecting a little one together. After tying the knot two months after announcing the exciting news, the pair welcomed daughter Cleopatra in December 2021.  “My heart has exploded,” the hairdresser said alongside a photo of the newborn. “@riccigrams and baby Cleo are doing fantastic. We’re all resting after such an eventful morning.. Welcome to the world baby Cleopatra Ricci Hampton.”  A month after Cleo’s birth, Ricci revealed that Hampton had actually chosen their daughter’s full name.  “We were gonna call her Cleo and then right before they were preparing me for the C-section, they started talking about how we had to fill out birth certificate stuff, [and] my husband was like, ‘We’ve got to give her a full name, right? And then the nickname is Cleo,’” Ricci recalled during a January 2022 appearance on the Ellen DeGeneres Show. “I was sort of like, ‘Whatever, we can talk about this later.’ Then he got so excited that he put it on Instagram.”  In a November 2022 interview with The Sunday Times, the Wednesday actress opened up about how giving birth to her first-born changed her in a lot of ways.  “My son’s birth really broke my nihilism and it was a pretty surprising change,” Ricci explained to the outlet. “I thought I would really love him and feel a lot of emotions towards him. I didn’t realize that it is all or nothing.”  The Sleepy Hollow star also took to social media to gush over her husband as a father and stepdad.  “Happy Valentine’s Day to the kindest, most fun, generous, most imaginative and brilliant man I have ever known,” Ricci gushed in February 2022. “You are of the best examples of your species and frankly, a unicorn 🦄(No wonder our little girl is crazy for them) 🦄You take care of us and love us in a way I never thought possible.

I would beg my husband not to leave me alone with our colicky baby girl. I felt like I’d made a terrible mistake. I wasn’t cut out to be a mother.  What I didn’t realize was that this wasn’t motherhood: this was postpartum anxiety and OCD, and I was paralyzed by my symptoms. One night my husband persuaded me to attend a local support group for moms. I was skeptical. How could these moms help? But I got there and I saw, well, just a bunch of moms. They looked normal. They weren’t “crazy,” and some of them were even getting better. And it wasn’t like a light switch turned on, but slowly I found some hope, felt less alone, and got on medication because these other mothers normalized taking medication as a tool for recovery. I am positive that the group saved my life.  Once I recovered, I became a volunteer for Moms Supporting Moms (MSM), a local organization, then the program coordinator for MSM, and now I am the Support Groups Manager for Postpartum Support International, an international non-profit. I’ve focused on supporting pregnant and postpartum parents for the last eight years, and I’d like to share some of the resources that I have learned about along the way.  The Triangle area has a wealth of resources to support moms, birthing people, and new families during one of life’s biggest transitions: having a baby.  mental health challenge is the #1 complication from childbirth and that 15-20% of moms experience anxiety and/or depression during pregnancy and/or postpartum (the perinatal period). While these challenges are common, they are also very difficult. In honor of Maternal Mental Health Awareness Month, I want to highlight the resources we have for expectant and postpartum parents. We know that experiencing aand that(the perinatal period). While these challenges are common, they are also very difficult.  In the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill area, there are so many organizations, businesses, and providers who are ready to help and trained in perinatal mental health. The three main tools for supporting pregnant and postpartum moms who are experiencing anxiety and/or depression are medication, therapy and peer support. All of those tools are available in our area:  The UNC’s Center for Women’s Mood Clinic in Chapel Hill has an inpatient psychiatry unit dedicated to pregnant and postpartum people. North Carolina is home to 1 of 3 units like this in the entire country. At the UNC Women’s Mood Clinic, pregnant and postpartum moms in a mental health crisis can find expert, inpatient care, which is a rarity in our nation. Anchor Perinatal is an outpatient intensive program focused solely on perinatal clients. Moms (or parents) can receive therapy and support group sessions from therapists trained in perinatal mental health and then go home to their families each day. Anchor also has a free, walk-in clinic for screening for perinatal mood challenges. The founding therapists are all extensively trained in perinatal mental health. This is an amazing resource! Moms Supporting Moms (MSM) is the longest running, free peer support group for pregnant and postpartum moms in the Triangle. Moms Supporting Moms meets every Thursday evening (virtually), so that moms can join together and know they are not alone. MSM also provides free, volunteer mentors to new moms. An experienced mom volunteers to guide a new mom through the first-year of her baby’s life. Support groups and mentors help fight against the stigma of perinatal mental health challenges, and the connection MSM provides is a wonderful tool to help moms get on the road to recovery. Equity Before Birth (EBB) serves Black families by providing financial support for pregnancy-related services and needs. EBB pays birth workers and educators to support pregnant black birthing people. We know that this type of support can save lives and can help decrease physical and mental health complications. Triangle Area Parenting Support (TAPS) provides a 10-week session (virtual) with other new parents in each area of the Triangle, so parents connect with those in their city. The sessions focus on information but also support and connection. These groups can help decrease isolation and increase parent confidence with new skills and education. Sessions are in English and Spanish. Family Connects Durham is a free nurse home visiting program for all parents of newborns, regardless of financial need. Registered nurses support all families in Durham County by providing no-cost postpartum home visits. Nurses can help identify a perinatal mood challenge and connect parents with resources to help them cope and decrease feelings of isolation. Emerald Doulas provides birth and postpartum doula care, support groups and classes. Emerald Doulas have support groups for pregnant parents, new moms, LGBTQ+ parents, and moms of color. HER Health Collective is a supportive community for all moms, with in-person and virtual events to help moms connect. HER also provides women’s health information from experts via their events and podcasts. You can check out my interview on their podcast if you want even more information on perinatal support in the Triangle area. Rosenberg Perinatal & Waypoint Counseling are two group practices focused on perinatal mental health in the Triangle. Rosenberg Perinatal is a group of mental health clinicians supporting the emotional wellbeing of pregnant and postpartum parents, individuals experiencing fertility challenges and adoptive parents. Many of their clinicians also speak Spanish! Waypoint Counseling is a team of mental health professionals with a special focus on postpartum anxiety and depression, birth trauma, NICU parenting, and much more. Waypoint can also help with medication management. MAAME (Mobilizing African American Mothers through Empowerment) empowers Black, Indigenous, and other People of Color during pregnancy and postpartum. MAAME can help to navigate systems, offer resources, services, and support. MAAME also has a maternal mental health program for parents of 0-5 year old children. In this program, mothers or birthing people can find a support group, individual peer support, and therapy sessions."

What You Need To Know Clearwater residents Kaitlyn and Tim McCallum began to notice a shell-like growth on back of their newborn son, James    A pediatric dermatologist in Orlando diagnosed James with giant congenital melanocytic nevus    Doctors have completed the removal process and now they’ve started a series of procedures to replace the bad skin with good skin      View photos of James' journey below  Kaitlyn delivered James in August, 2021. When he came out, there was a scabby growth on his back.  “(It was) terrifying, to say the least,” Kaitlyn said. “Right when he was born, it was pretty flat. There was a bump by his neck, there was a lump.”  “That’s kind of concerning, when you have medical professionals and they’re telling you they’ve never seen this before,” said Tim, who said doctors were initially puzzled.  As the McCallum parents searched for answers, struggling with the uncertainty, the growth increased in size, becoming lumpier and fattier. The spots grew darker, the texture became fleshier and the exterior grew hairier.  The growth began to resemble a turtle shell, with Kaitlyn and Tim adopting the nickname of “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle” for their toddler.  “We try to give him any superhero nickname, because that’s what he is to us,” Kaitlyn said.  Unfortunately, the shell-like growth also began to hinder James’ life. He couldn’t sleep on his back, which is a safe sleep practice for babies, and his head and neck movement became more and more restricted.  Finally, a pediatric dermatologist in Orlando offered a diagnosis: A giant congenital melanocytic nevus.  It’s a large patch of skin, often described as a mole or a birthmark, which presents at birth or develops in a baby’s first year. It is usually not harmful, though it can develop into cancer or become dangerous if it reaches the brain or spine. Thankfully, in James’ case, it was cumbersome, but harmless.  “Getting that diagnosis of ‘Okay, here is what It is, here’s who you can go to, here’s how we’re going to fix it,’ that was the moment of, ‘Okay, we can do this,’” Kaitlyn said.  Doctors began the removal process when James was six months old, starting with the lump by his neck and then moving down his back to remove the bulk of the shell. Now, they’ve started a series of procedures to remove the bad skin and replace it with good skin. A specialist at the University of Chicago is spearheading that work.  When it’s all over, doctors hope James will be left with nothing more than a scar. His parents know their turtle-shell hero will have a story to tell and they’ll look back on the strength it took for all of them to endure this birth surprise.  “I’ve learned how strong you can be and how much a mother can do for a kid,” Kaitlyn said. “Just keep staying strong. There’s an end to this and we’re almost there.”"

Of the five delivered by Siddhi on May 4 three have died and two are still alive. As per Akansha Mahajan, the Director of Delhi Zoo, Siddhi last gave birth on January 16, 2005.  Sharing details with the media, Mahajan said that while Siddhi was born in the wild and brought from Nagpur’s Gorewada Zoo, the father of the cubs, Karan was from Mysore Zoo and born in a zoo. The father is 10 years old and the mother is six.  Siddhi is attending to the two cubs and the zoo authorities are constantly monitoring their condition.  At present NZP has four adult Royal Bengal Tigers and their names are Karan, Siddhi, Aditi and Barkha. Aditi like Siddhi is of wild origin and was acquired from Gorewada.  Last year in August, three white tiger cubs were born at NZP after a gap of seven years. In December one of them died and the other two – Avani and Vyom – were released into an enclosure for public viewing last month.  Besides the six golden Royal Bengal tigers including the cubs, the Delhi Zoo houses five white tigers, taking the total number of tigers at NZP to 11.  NZP has been housing tigers since the inauguration on November 1, 1959. From then on Delhi Zoo is maintaining its population for conservation, education and display. Tigers have bred well in Delhi Zoo and also given in exchange to many zoos of the country and abroad.  The Zoo is part of the planned conservation breeding programme being run by Central Zoo Authority since 2010."

Today is the International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia, and Transphobia, and the Slovak government needs to be aware that the world is watching and will not be silent if the country violates people’s human rights. Rado Sloboda, Director of Amnesty International Slovakia  “Today is the International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia, and Transphobia, and the Slovak government needs to be aware that the world is watching and will not be silent if the country violates people’s human rights.  “This law will gravely impact the rights of transgender people, forcing them to reveal their gender assigned at birth in everyday circumstances, such as signing for parcels. It will increase the risk of bullying, discrimination, or violence, and impact the right to privacy. This bill should not pass.”  Background  The National Assembly of the Slovak Republic is due to vote on Bill No. 301/1995, also known as the Birth Number Act which, if adopted, would force transgender people to prove they have the ‘correct’ set of chromosomes to have their legal gender affirmed. The act regulates birth numbers, the personal 10 digit identifier given to everyone in Slovakia on the day they are born. It includes information about the date of birth, and numbers for two genders – women are given the number 5, and men the numeral 0. The birth number must be changed to have your gender legally affirmed, but the law would effectively make this impossible, as most transgender people don’t have chromosomes matching their gender identity."

Share this page on Facebook Share this page on Twitter Share this page on LinkedIn Email this page to a friend Print this page  When John Somers arrived to compete at the PGA Professional Championship in late April, he had more than golf on his mind. In fact, just days before, Somers did not know if he would even be able to play.  Somers, who played at Elon from 2009 to 2014, became a father for the first time two days before flying to New Mexico to play in the tournament. John and wife Catherine, another Elon alumna, welcomed daughter Colbie on April 25, just five days before the event was scheduled to begin.  The due date for Colbie’s birth was May 17 but Somers said the early birth was a “blessing in disguise” as it meant he would no longer have to worry about missing her birth while competing at a tournament. After spending some time in the neonatal intensive care unit, Colbie was able to come home with no health issues, which gave Somers the peace of mind he needed to compete at the PGA Professional Championship.  “I wasn’t even expecting to play,” Somers said. “It had always been on my mind, am I going to miss the birth of my baby? It worked out where the baby came and I got to be there with my wife and then welcome my little girl knowing that my wife and the baby are healthy and she’s got a huge family support system, which made me very comfortable and know that I can go out there and play golf and not have to worry about anything.”  Somers works as the head PGA professional at the Southern Hills Plantation Club in Brooksville, Fla. Among his duties include golf shop and staff oversight and running tournaments hosted by the club.  The PGA Professional Championship is a tournament for golf club professionals and teachers who are members of the Professional Golfers’ Association of America. This year, over 300 players competed, with the top 20 finishers earning spots at the PGA Championship, one of the four major tournaments in men’s golf.  During one of his practice rounds in the leadup to the tournament, Somers wrote Colbie’s name on a golf ball to honor his first daughter. However, he quickly had to alter his tribute upon teeing off.  “I lost it on that same hole and I felt so guilty and so bad about it,” Somers said. “I was like, maybe a golf ball’s not a thing to do. So, I started writing it on my glove right below my thumb so that way I can always see it. It’s just a really great tribute for her and hopefully, I can make her proud.”  After shooting a 68 in both the second and third rounds, Somers shared the 54-hole lead. Although he did not win the tournament after a final-round 73, Somers easily secured a spot in this week’s PGA Championship by tying for fourth.  Somers said he did not have a chance to reflect on qualifying for the PGA Championship following the round due to his media obligations and thinking about seeing his family.  “I was just so focused on getting back home and being with my daughter and my wife. It wasn’t really until probably Saturday or Sunday when I started getting all the emails and I’m looking at flights and hotels,” Somers said. “That’s when it kind of hit me like, oh man, I’m actually doing this. I’m playing a major.”  A graduate of Bartlett Yancey High School, located just over 30 minutes from Elon, Somers had a prolific college career with the Phoenix. He was named the team’s most valuable player in both 2013 and 2014 and won the 2014 Coca-Cola Wofford Invitational. He credited his time at Elon for helping him develop as a player.  “College golf is always special because it’s really your last time for a lot of people to experience a team atmosphere,” Somers said. “I made lifelong friends. We played some great golf courses. I had two great coaches with Bill Morningstar and Don Hill. It definitely shaped me into the player I am today.”  Somers has played tournaments on the PGA Latinoamerica and the Korn Ferry Tour, the direct feeder tour for the PGA Tour, but this will be his first appearance at a major championship. The event will be held at Oak Hill Country Club in Rochester, New York, on May 18-21. The course has hosted six major championships, including three PGA Championships, most recently in 2013.  To prepare for the event, Somers said he has spent time watching highlights from the 2013 PGA Championship and other videos overviewing the course. Despite this being his first appearance in a major, Somers said he has high expectations for the week.  “I’d love to win it,” Somers said.”That’s the thing I always tell myself – don’t enter a tournament unless you want to win it.”  Somers will play with Christiaan Bezuidenhout and Chez Reavie, who have combined to win six tournaments on the PGA and DP World Tours, in the first two days. They will tee off in the opening round on Thursday, May 18, at 1:14 p.m. and on Friday, May 19, at 7:49 a.m. The tournament will air on ESPN, ESPN+ and CBS throughout the week."

In 1928, Nazrul’s trainer at the Gramophone Co was Dhiren Das . Over the years, their bond strengthened so much that Nazrul felt an urge to write a four-page-long poem on their relationship.The poem’s original manuscript has not come in the public domain before. Das’ son Arabinda had donated the manuscript for preservation at the Jiban Smriti Archive. On Nazrul’s birth anniversary that will be celebrated on May 26 this year, the manuscript will be on display for the public.Founder of the archive Arindam Saha Sardar said, “Das, who was an accomplished singer, was also actor Anup Kumar’s father. This year, Das family gifted this manuscript to us. I am immensely grateful to Arabinda Das for trusting us with the preservation job. This is not just a personal document but a national treasure. It has Kazi Nazrul’s own handwriting.”Das had joined as a trainer at the Gramaphone Co. in 1924. Later, the likes of Bimal Dasgupta and Tulsi Lahiri joined the music company too. “In 1928, K Mullick gained popularity by singing ‘Bagichae bulbuli tui’. When asked about the identity of the songwriter, he mentioned Kazi Nazrul Islam. One day, Mullick chanced upon Nazrul somewhere near Rajabazar and introduced the Gramophone Co. officials to him,” said Das’ son, Arabinda.On persuasion. Nazrul agreed to sign a contract with the Gramaphone Co. According to this contracts, Das’ responsibility was to learn the songs from him and then teach them to others. This process continued for long and soon the duo became great friends. What endeared Nazrul to Das further was the latter’s ability to memorize a song quickly. “He used to address Baba as ‘shrutidhor’. Kazi Jyathamoshai , as we referred him, would say: ‘If Dinu Thakur is Tagore’s ‘kandari’, Dhiren is my ‘gaandhari’ because he can retain my gaan (songs) in his memory. Baba was the first outsider to set Nazrul’s songs to his tunes.

Baba got him an accommodation next to our house on Hari Ghosh Street,” Arabinda added.It was very natural for Nazrul to want posterity to know about this friendship. That’s why both decided that Nazrul would write a 14-stanza-long poem on their relationship and Das would set it to tune. But the poem never turned into a song. The untitled poem has Nazrul’s signature."

(Caters)  A mum has revealed how doctors called her pregnancy ‘one in 50 million’ after she conceived twin boys in two separate uteruses.  Madeline Kaklikos, 24, was diagnosed with a rare condition called uterus didelphys after she and her husband Jon, 27, spent a year trying to have a baby naturally.  Uterus didelphys – where a woman is born with two uteruses – affects just 0.3% of the population. This meant that Kaklikos had both two uteruses and two cervixes.  Read more: Mum-to-be suffered burst brain tumour which forced her to give birth while in a coma  Kaklikos began IVF at the end of 2021, and after nine unsuccessful rounds with one uterus, doctors tried using her other uterus instead, which was successful.  “When I was ten weeks pregnant, we went back for another scan to check on how our miracle baby was doing,” Kaklikos explains.  During this scan, to their astonishment, the doctor told Kakliko and her husband that there was another baby showing, but that this baby was in her other uterus.  Kaklikos gave birth to twins Nate and Cole in February this year. (Caters)  “I thought she must have been joking with us,” Kaklikos recalls. “The second baby was measuring smaller than the first, so it's suspected that we conceived another baby spontaneously the week after our transfer.  “Medics told me that this was a one in 50 million pregnancy because Nate was in one uterus and Cole was in the other, and they had also been conceived in different ways and at different times. Nate was conceived through IVF and Cole was a spontaneous pregnancy.”  Kaklikos says that she and her husband were in such shock after they were told they were having two babies, they both sat in silence for 20 minutes.

He revealed on ""Foley Is Pod"" that his wife was having a difficult pregnancy with his daughter, Noelle, and that was something that took precedence for him. Despite being the ""Hardcore Legend,"" Foley is well-known for being a family man and someone who cares for others, which he has often been praised for over the years.  ""She had to spend most of the day resting, and so I asked Eric if I could have the time off.

""He granted me the time off.""  The break was something that Foley appreciated as he made it clear that telling the story was a thank you to WCW. Being able to have a break at the time of his daughter's birth is something that a lot of professional wrestlers aren't able to have.  ""When I came back we were able to do some pretty good business,"" he said. ""And I was able to be there when Noelle was born.""

Alayna Holt, 71st Comptroller Squadron commander, was the first at Vance Air Force Base to use the expanded military parental-leave program for Airmen and Guardians.  Following the birth of her daughter in early December 2022, Holt, and her husband, Maj. Zachary Jarvis, 71st Security Forces Squadron commander, were grateful to be a part of a team that fully supported their caregiver leave.  Although Holt and Jarvis became parents before the new policy became effective, Dec. 27, 2022, senior leadership at Vance Air Force Base approved caregiver leave in the spirit of the new policy.  The updated policy authorizes birth parents 12 weeks of caregiver leave following a health-provider recommended period of convalescent leave.  “It’s such a special time to bond with your new child and figure out how to be a first-time parent,” said Holt. “I’m thankful that I took that time.”  Under the previous policy, birth parents received six weeks of caregiver leave following their convalescent leave. But if caregiver leave was not taken immediately after the birth of a child it would be lost.  Non-birth parents received only 21 days of caregiver leave compared to the new policy which authorizes non-birth parents 12 weeks of caregiver leave following the birth of their child.  As a male caregiver, it’s a positive step forward from only 21 days of caregiver leave, said Jarvis.  “The policy is well written in that the leave can be taken in segments of seven days at a time,” said Jarvis. If mission requirements prevent taking the full 12 weeks at once, it can be spread out after the birth of the child.  “Leadership at Vance was supportive of taking ordinary leave in conjunction with my wife’s caregiver leave,” said Jarvis. “We were able to go back home and introduce our daughter to the family. The extra time gave us the opportunity to secure childcare once we returned to work.”  “The bond between a child and a parent is special and those first few months are critical to the formation of a bond that will last a lifetime,” said Col Jay Johnson, 71st Flying Training Wing commander. “I think the new policy is a step in the right direction and will have a positive impact on recruitment and retention.”  “Find what works best for your situation,” said Holt. “If that is not taking all 12 weeks at the same time, that’s okay. But take advantage of the great benefits we have.”  Holt was initially skeptical about being able to take off so much time from work, especially as a squadron commander. But she realized the importance of setting a precedent.  “I reached out to a fellow squadron commander at a different base who had a child a couple of weeks after I did,” said Holt. “She was in the same boat as me, unsure about taking so much time off.”  Both Holt and Jarvis felt it was important to demonstrate the value of what the Air Force was offering parents. “If I’m taking my caregiver leave, I’m showing my folks that it is important,” said Jarvis. “And I expect them to take caregiver leave when that time comes for them.”  Holt and Jarvis are optimistic that their Airmen will see that if their commanders can utilize the new policy, so can they.  “The right thing to do is to take this time to be with your family, because at the end of the day, at the end of the year, at the end of your career, your family is still going to be by your side,” said Holt. “However long you choose to serve, at the end of that time, you want your family there.”  “Major Holt and Major Jarvis are setting a fantastic example for Team Vance Airman to follow,” said Johnson. “They’ve proven that we’ll continue to do what we’ve always done, rally around each other to balance the demands of service to our country and obligations to care for our families.”  “I think the new policy shows we are committed to Airmen,” said Jarvis. “We recruit Airmen but we retain families.”"

The young cat was struggling with her labour - a stillborn kitten was stuck in her birth canal - and she needed to undergo a caesarean section.  Under surgery she was able to give birth to four of her kittens, although another was also stillborn.  RSPCA animal rescue officer Melanie Froude says the cat, who has been named Lily, looked to have been well cared for before her surgery and while she is not microchipped the officer is appealing for her owner to get in touch or for anyone who may know of her background.  “It was very fortunate that someone noticed this poor cat struggling by the side of the road. The lady realised she was in difficulty and took her back to her home in nearby Dodleston before calling us,” said the animal rescue officer.  “We were able to give Lily the care she needed and she gave birth to four kittens, who are doing well.  “On the basis of her appearance she doesn’t look like she is a stray. I made door-to-door enquiries at properties near to where she was found and I put up a few posters as well.  ""So far no-one has come forward, but maybe someone is worried about the whereabouts of their cat? Or someone might know who the owners of this lovely, friendly cat are, and I would urge them to get in touch.”  After recovering from her surgery at a private boarding cattery, Lily is due to go into the care of RSPCA Bryn-y-Maen Animal Centre in Colwyn Bay. She will be rehomed if an owner does not come forward.  Anyone with information is asked to call the RSPCA appeals line number on 0300 123 8018."

She stated that nurses are present in every community, large or small, urban or rural, providing competent care from birth to death, emphasizing that ""nurses' responsibilities span from direct patient care and case management to implementing quality assurance procedures and overseeing complex nursing care systems.""  Ms. Enchill's remarks came during the weekly ""Your Health! Our Collective Responsibility,"" a Ghana News Agency Tema Regional Office initiative aimed at promoting health-related communication and providing a platform for health information dissemination in order to influence personal health choices through improved health literacy.  The Ghana News Agency's Tema Regional Office established the public health advocacy platform ""Your Health! Our Collective Responsibility"" to investigate the elements of four health communication approaches: informing, instructing, persuading, and promoting.  Ms. Enchill stated that as part of commemorating the 2023 International Nurses Day, nurses care for injuries, dispense drugs, conduct frequent medical checks, and record thorough medical histories.  She believes that nurses are the cornerstone of the health professionals since they monitor heart rate and blood pressure, do diagnostic tests, operate medical equipment, draw blood, and admit and discharge patients depending on physician orders.  She did, however, underline that, despite their role, nurses' efforts are not always recognized by patients and their families inside the health sector, and she pushed for a paradigm shift.  ""Without the contribution and active work of a nurse, no other professional in the health sector can operate; we are the engine in general health delivery, and we must be accorded the due recognition and appreciation,"" said the IMaH Registered General Nurse.  Mr. Samuel Adu Ntiamoah, also a Registered General Nurse at IMaH, contributed to the conversation by underlining the significance of nurses in the healthcare profession.  He argues they are the first point of contact for a patient at the hospital and the last person they see before leaving.  The nurse, according to Mr. Ntiamoah, directs the patient ""to see the doctor and attend the laboratory,"" making them the hospital's heart.  Speaking about patient rights, Mr. Francis Ameyibor, Tema Regional Manager, Ghana News Agency, remarked that a patient has the right to privacy regarding his or her medical condition.  He discovered that communication and compassion foster trust between patients and caretakers, increasing their overall satisfaction.  ""Patients are also more likely to adhere to their treatment recommendations when they are given more information and respect,"" he continues.  Mr. Ameyibor pushed for concerted efforts to educate the people on how to care for and conserve the environment, respect the rights of other patients and health providers, and use and not abuse the health care system responsibly.  He praised nurses for their crucial role in people's total well-being from birth to death, as well as their work in some of the most difficult environments in the country.  —CDA Consult II Contributor"

Recently, astronomers utilised this telescope's cutting-edge technology to observe a distant star-forming galaxy, delving into its intricate structure with unprecedented detail.  Discovery of the Galaxy  Harnessing the capabilities of NASA's billion-dollar observatory, the James Webb Space Telescope's Orbiter Spacecraft has unveiled the stellar composition of GN20, one of the earliest-known galaxies in the universe. Situated a staggering 12 billion light years away, this captivating discovery represents a luminous and dust-laden star-forming galaxy of extraordinary brilliance.  Significance of the Galaxy  What makes GN20 particularly intriguing is its relatively recent formation, occurring a mere 1.5 billion years after the cataclysmic event known as the Big Bang. Positioned within a region of space referred to as a protocluster or galaxy overdensity, this area holds astronomers' fascination due to its eventual culmination in the formation of colossal galactic clusters.  Insights into the Galaxy's Structure  The captivating image captured by the James Webb Space Telescope allows us to peer back in time when the universe was a mere 1.5 billion years old, as it stands at approximately 13.5 million years presently. Astonishingly, this ancient galaxy boasts a star formation rate approximately 1,860 times greater than the mass of our Sun each year. Astronomers, under the guidance of Luis Colina from the Spanish Astrobiology Centre, employed the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) to examine GN20's structural properties during November 23-24, 2022.  Findings of the Study  Analysis of the MIRI images unveiled a clumpy molecular gas surrounding the galaxy, forming a colossal disk spanning about 46,000 light-years in diameter. Furthermore, the measurements indicated that the galaxy comprises a diffuse gas envelope encompassing a densely packed nucleus of shimmering stars. Remarkably, the nucleus spans a mere 2,600 light-years across, while the gaseous envelope extends approximately 23,000 light-years.  About the James Webb Space Telescope  James Webb Space Telescope stands as NASA's most prominent and powerful space science observatory. Boasting a large infrared telescope with a primary mirror of around 6.5 metres, this state-of-the-art instrument represents a monumental leap forward in our quest to understand the cosmos. It has been positioned a million miles out into space. It orbits the Sun and not the Earth."

The star asked fans last month whether he should change his name on social media. He tweeted ""ABEL formally known as The Weeknd?"".

Now the leading cause of death of children under 5, prematurity is an urgent public health issue. Every year, an estimated 13.4 million babies are born preterm (before 37 weeks of pregnancy) while an even higher number - over 20 million babies - have a low birthweight (under 2.5 kg at birth). For these babies, KMC is a proven, effective intervention for saving lives and improving their health and development.  “Kangaroo mother care is one of the most critical, lifesaving measures to improve the survival prospects and wellbeing of babies born early or small,” said Dr Anshu Banerjee, Director for Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health at WHO. “Ensuring mothers and babies everywhere can stay together and practice kangaroo mother care immediately after birth will require a radical rethink of how maternal and newborn care is organized - these new publications aim to support this process.”  The two publications - a global position paper and implementation strategy - seek to enable the expansion of KMC within health facilities and at home, globally. They follow the release of landmark new guidelines published last year, which recommend KMC as the essential standard of care for all preterm and low birthweight babies, starting right after birth. The new documents highlight that it should be available both for babies that are well and sick - for at least eight hours a day – including in intensive care.  “For most health facilities, achieving the widespread adoption of kangaroo mother care for all preterm or low birthweight babies will require fundamental changes in newborn care provision, especially neonatal intensive care,” said Dr Shuchita Gupta, Medical Officer at WHO who coordinated the development of the new documents. “This includes changes to the physical layout of care facilities, that enable the mother to stay with her small and sick baby inside the newborn care unit on a 24/7 basis. It also means changing the way healthcare is provided so that obstetricians, midwives, paediatricians, and nurses work together in harmony to care for mothers and babies in one place, as a unit.”  KMC has been shown to significantly improve survival and health outcomes for preterm and low birthweight babies, compared to clinical stabilization in a more ‘high-tech’ incubator or warmer. In fact, data shows it can increase preterm survival rates by as much as a third, reduce infections, prevent hypothermia, and improve feeding and growth. It is also empowering and reassuring for mothers and families who take a leading role in providing care for their infants.  Despite these benefits, only around a third of countries are estimated to have an updated policy or guideline on KMC, meaning millions of preterm and low birthweight babies are likely to be missing out on this lifesaving technique.  The new documents outline some key actions that should be taken to enable the wider adoption and implementation of KMC:  Governments should recognize and include KMC as essential care for all preterm or small babies, ensuring it is financed and monitored – including the necessary infrastructure changes within hospitals - as part of national programmes. Additional parental leave and entitlements can help address the special needs of caregivers of preterm or low birthweight infants so that they can provide the requisite care.  Facilities and healthcare providers should help ensure small and preterm babies can benefit from skin-to-skin contact with their mother for the recommended 8-24 hours a day, starting immediately after birth. Critically, both mother and newborn should receive respectful care, together, as a unit - even when the infant is sick and requires care inside the newborn care unit. Parents and caregivers should be involved in routine care and all aspects of decision-making around care for their newborns. They should be supported – with coaching, emotional and practical assistance - to provide KMC for their small and preterm babies.  Partners and family members can help in providing KMC, providing relief for the mother, stepping in if she is unwell, and helping meet her needs while she is caring for her baby.  Developed in collaboration with a multi-country, multi-stakeholder working group, these resources are directed to governments, programme partners, policy makers and the broader public health community, to help countries expand KMC for babies born early or small. Around the world, WHO is providing ongoing assistance in implementing and scaling up KMC as the foundation of small and/or sick newborn care within national maternal, newborn and child health programmes.  Editor’s note:  The Working Group that developed these documents is comprised of various scientific experts, Ministries of Health and representatives from UN agencies (UNICEF, the World Bank, WHO), bilateral agencies (USAID, Japan International Cooperation Agency -JICA, Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation-NORAD, the Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office of the United Kingdom- UK-FCDO), donor organizations (Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF), Laerdal Foundation), parents groups (European Foundation for the Care of Newborn Infants, FUNDAPREMA, Preemie Connect), professional associations (the American Academy of Pediatrics,, Council of International Neonatal Nurses (COINN), the International Confederation of Midwives, the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO), the International Pediatric Association), and non-governmental organizations (Kangaroo Foundation, Médecins sans Frontières, Save the Children) and specialized partnerships like the Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health."

The child, born May 13, 2022, is named RZA Athelston Mayers, according to a copy of a birth certificate obtained by the Daily Mail and People.  RZA (pronounced rizz-uh) is also the performing name of Robert Fitzgerald Diggs, the main and founding member of legendary Staten Island hip-hop group Wu Tang Clan. Neither Rihanna or the baby’s father, rapper ASAP Rocky, have commented publicly on their child’s name.  ASAP Rocky, whose real name is Rakim Athelaston Mayers, was also named after hip-hop royalty. He and his sister Erika were named after the Long Island hip-hop duo Eric B. & Rakim, according to 2011 profiles from Pitchfork and Complex.  ASAP Rocky, who grew up in Harlem, has recalled being raised around hip-hop in multiple interviews. Along with other major acts of the 1980s and 1990s, he regularly names the Wu-Tang Clan as among his musical influences.  “I grew up listening to Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, DMX, UGK, Three 6 Mafia, Wu-Tang Clan, everybody,” he told Complex in 2011. “My mum and dad, they came to an agreement and they both named me after Rakim. Honestly, I can’t even meet that guy, man. That would be so crazy.  “I was thinking about naming my child Kanye,” he added with a laugh. ASAP Rocky has collaborated with Kanye West, who now goes by Ye, throughout his career.  Rihanna first revealed she was pregnant with RZA in January 2022 with an Instagram shot of her midsection and ASAP Rocky’s hand resting on her arm. Since giving birth that May, the Grammy-winning singer and business magnate has mostly kept the child from the public eye, sparingly sharing videos of RZA to social media.  She first introduced her son in a TikTok in December and posted a second video in April.  Before posting publicly about her child, with his name still under wraps, Rihanna was asked about her privacy in a November interview with the Associated Press.  “We just didn’t get around to it yet, really,” she said. “We’ve just been living. But I guess there’s a certain freedom that comes with kind of just like getting it out there.”  As rumours swirled of a second child, Rihanna revealed she was pregnant shortly after performing at the Super Bowl LVII halftime show in February.  The Lift Me Up performer and ASAP Rocky are not the first set of famous people to name their child after other famous people.  Fergie and Josh Duhamel, who have since divorced, reportedly named their son, Axl Jack Duhamel, 9, after Guns N’ Roses frontman Axl Rose.  Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon, who have also divorced, named one of their 11-year-old twins, Monroe Cannon, after the late actor Marilyn Monroe, one of Carey’s inspirations, according to ABC News.  David and Victoria Beckham took a more literary route, naming their child, Harper Seven Beckham, after To Kill A Mockingbird author Harper Lee, according to the Guardian. – Los Angeles Times/Tribune News Service"

The Derry City and Strabane District Council candidate said she’s “delighted” to announce the birth of baby Bennett in recent days as she thanked the “amazing Community Ante-natal Team” in Strabane.  ""I will still be contesting the election in two days’ time, and hope to get back to my campaign soon,” she added.  ""The fact that I have given birth so close to the election will make for a great story for Bennett when he's older.”  Aontú leader Peadar Tóibín TD welcomed the “most fantastic news” for all involved in this campaign.  ""With politics there is always a lot of negativity, especially so close to the finish line, but this brilliant news reaching us, of the birth of baby Bennett, has put a smile on all Aontú faces across the island, and given us all a fantastic boost of happiness.  ""In congratulating Leza and her family, I want to pay tribute to her hard work in this campaign. Leza Houston is a working student, currently studying Law in Ulster University.  ""She lives in West Tyrone with her young family. Leza’s passion for human rights motivated her to get involved in politics.

Aontú selected Leza Houston to contest the Derg DEA, West Tyrone in the upcoming local election.  She is a working student, currently studying law in Ulster University.

Ms Houston said Aontú is a movement that is dedicated to the Human Right to life of everyone, the unity of Ireland and economic justice for all in society.  Speaking at the time she was selected, she added: “I believe in the traditional Republican vision that all the children of the nation should be cherished equally.”  Mrs Houston continued: ""I am especially frustrated with what’s happening to my county of Tyrone. The cost of living crisis is hurting so many families.  ""That people are going without food and heat while the political establishment are sitting on their hands in Stormont is not good enough.  ""We are calling on MLAs to lose their salaries if they won't do their job. It would not be tolerated in any other walk of life.  ""We are also calling for the end to the system where any one party can crash the Assembly over and over again or block the Assembly from functioning and we want to devolve economic power from London to Belfast so Stormont can actually help people here."""

The Director, Vital Registration, Mathew Sunday, disclosed this to our correspondent on Tuesday.  It would be recalled that the United Nations Children’s Fund, on Friday said only 33 per cent of children in Nigeria have birth certificates.  UNICEF’s Chief of Kano Field Office, Rahama Farah, stated this during a stakeholders’ meeting on birth registration organised by UNICEF in collaboration with the NPC in Kano.  Farah, represented by the Senior Education Specialist, Michael Banda, said, “The Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey MICS 2021 shows that about one in every four births of Nigerian children aged under five years are not registered. According to MICS 2021, only 33 per cent of these registered children have a birth certificate.”  Giving updates on the efforts thus far by the NPC in ensuring that children in Nigeria get registered at birth, Sunday said, “We are collaborating with the health sector, especially the Primary Health Care. We are going to have a meeting very soon with all the stakeholders in the health sector. We are going digital.  “We are automating the processes of childbirth registration to ensure that there will be no double registration and for the purpose of probability. We are working with other sister agencies such as the Federal Ministry of Health and the National Bureau of Statistics because sharing data on the analogue platform is very difficult.  “A lot of children are born outside medical facilities, especially in rural areas. One measure that we have adopted is that we have found out that these children are immunised, irrespective of where they are born.  “We have been collaborating with the health sector for years but it is not enough. We are now moving into integrating birth registration into the health sector activities. For instance, on the immunisation card of a child, one will see a column if a child is registered and if not, the health personnel will advise the parents to go register the child.”"

Toiréasa had been feeling some pains throughout the night on Tuesday so, when Barry came down ready for work, she told him to stay off so he could be close in case anything happened.  Toiréasa said: “I phoned the hospital in the morning but I was told to keep an eye on things for the meantime. We decided to go for a walk and lunch in the Sandwich Company at 1pm.

""Total creativity involves a certain degree of rebellion. To be completely creative, I tend to do things that are a little bit forbidden,"" said Eaves, who has fully controlled the distillation, aging and bottling of Forbidden from grain to glass. ""While creating Forbidden, I have had the freedom to cross deep into uncharted territory by using nontraditional ingredients and techniques. The resulting bourbon, on my palate, is perfection.""  Photos are available to download photos here.  The first release of Forbidden is a small batch, hand-blended 5-year-old bourbon bottled at 95.2 proof. This bold and elegant expression is beautifully balanced and complex. Forbidden's unique blend of cuisine-quality white corn, white winter wheat and malted barley give it a sweet and smooth profile. Darker notes balance Forbidden and originate from both charred barrels and fruity, floral yeast. Aroma leads with vanilla bean and crème brûlée, dried fruit, hazelnut, light sweet citrus notes and gentle layered spice. The palate: caramel, citrus oil and delicate floral along with baking spices, oak sugar, soft chewy sweet with a hint of grain. The finish lingers creamy sweetness with oak and spice.  ""With Forbidden, we've taken our time to create something completely original in Kentucky bourbon,"" said Daniel Rickenmann, who is one of the new brand's four South Carolina-based partners along with Eaves in Kentucky. ""Forbidden is a bourbon you finish and say, 'This is my first drink and my last drink of the evening.' It's a symphony of flavor, complexity and warmth.""  Story continues  Rickenmann adds about Eaves, ""Marianne's preoccupation with achieving such a high level of work means she doesn't follow the usual script. For nearly two decades, Marianne has steadily stepped outside of the norm in her career and with her work to create Forbidden, she defies every expectation.""  Distilled, aged and bottled at Bardstown Bourbon Company by Marianne Eaves, Forbidden will be available initially in these states: Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia and South Carolina and online at an SRP of $129. The first release will include a highly allocated number of hand-blended bottles along with three single barrel cask strength expressions.

While Moakler has reportedly not had the best relationship with her youngest child, she has made multiple attempts to find and build a connection between them. In a recent effort, the reality star uploaded a throwback image that she used to announce Alabama’s arrival into the world in 2005. She shares the teen with her ex-husband and musician Travis Barker.  Shanna Moakler Threw It Back To The Day She Announced The Arrival Of Her Baby Girl  It is not throwback Thursday yet, but December 24, 2005, will always hold a special place in Moakler’s as it was the third time she would become a mother. Even though the Miss Teen USA 1992 rep had welcomed two other kids — Atiana De La Hoya and Landon Barker, she was still ecstatic to hold the adorable chub in her arms.  To announce the big news, the doting mom created a Hollywood-inspired poster featuring the newborn sporting a serious look in the middle. Alabama was donned in a long-sleeved outfit, a blanket, and a head warmer.  Above her were numerous statements expressing joy, such as “2 thumbs way up!” “The cutest baby ever!” “She’ll laugh, she’ll cry, she’ll mess up her diaper!” and “Put her on your “must see” list for 2005/2006.”  The announcement banner also included a five-star rating for the tot, along with her full name, date and location of her birth, her weight at birth, and the doctor in charge of the labor. “She had the coolest birth announcement ever lol,” the enamored Moakler wrote under the pic, which she shared via her Instagram Story.  The Rhode Island native had most recently tried to work on her and Alabama’s tumultuous bond by trying to get her hooked on one of her favorite pastimes, gaming. Per The Blast, the mother-of-three had taken time from her busy schedule to play video games with the 17-year-old.  She shared evidence of their excellent time through an image that showed the teenager lying on a couch with headphones on her head. The Internet personality wore a pink and white striped two-piece set that could pass for pajamas for the occasion.  She finished her pose by throwing the peace sign at the camera, concealing her mouth and nose from view. However, the bits that could be seen showcased her slightly made-up face, consisting of a barely noticeable winged eyeliner.  Alabama’s hair was also styled perfectly, tucked under what appeared to be a multicolored bonnet. Tagging her, her mother penned, “I’m making a gamer out of her 😂😂😘,” across the image.  The ‘Search Party’ Celebrity Contestant Slammed Travis Barker’s New Wife On Her Birthday  Anybody who has recently followed the news is well aware of the tension between Moakler and Travis’ current wife, Kourtney Kardashian. However, in case you are unaware, the former Playboy Playmate of the Month has never shied away from airing her dislike for the Poosh founder publicly, and she did so again during the latter’s 44th birthday festivities.  The moment occurred after she uploaded a photo of herself wearing makeup following the premiere of her ex-husband and Kardashian’s wedding special, “Til Death Do Us Part,” in April.  “I hope that you get a huge apology some day for what was said on that exploitative, money grabbing, circus,” one fan had commented under the post, earning a like from the “Pacific Blue” series regular.  A second person had then chimed in, “Also kourtney wrote on twitter she’s now a mom of 6,” referring to the three children the D-A-S-H co-owner shares with ex-partner Scott Disick — Mason, Penelope, and Reign — in addition to her husband and Moakler’s three kids.  The “Friends ‘Til the End” star promptly responded, “she post more of my kids then [sic] her own lol.” She had previously taken a swipe at another Kardashian, when a fan mistook her for Khloe.  At the time, the netizen had written, “Literally thought that was Khloe Kardashian!” under another Instagram post. Moakler did not hesitate before dropping, “khloe doesn’t even look like khloe what are you people smoking lol.”  Judging by the amount of likes the reply received; it is clear that people shared the same sentiment and were glad to see it finally said."

Emma Taylor, 33, from Chelmsford, was around seven months pregnant when she was rushed to hospital after collapsing one evening in October 2022.  Emma was taken straight into A&E where doctors examined her and said Emma needed to deliver her baby immediately. But soon after the birth, doctors found Emma had a bleed on the brain, and she was airlifted to Queen's Hospital in Romford, where they discovered she had a huge tumour at the base of her skull.  Emma's partner Scott Weeks, 47, spoke to EssexLive, saying that October 13 began as a normal day, but soon descended into chaos. While out buying some bits and pieces for the baby, Emma was suddenly hit by a severe headache and told Scott she was going to have to go to bed to sleep it off.  Read more: Essex woman, 22, with 34H breasts denied NHS reduction surgery due to BMI  But at around 7pm that evening, Scott heard a thump: ""She was sprawled out on the floor, she literally looked like she'd fallen out of bed."" Emma was slurring and said she couldn't move her left side. Scott said: ""That sent alarm bells ringing as I thought, oh my god, this is much more serious than I thought.""  He and a neighbour eventually drove Emma to Broomfield Hospital, as Scott was told an ambulance would take four hours to arrive. She was soon examined by doctors, who told Scott Emma was going to have to deliver her baby immediately.  (Image: Scott Weeks)  Emma and Scott's daughter Ophelia was born at 9.08pm on October 13, and while she was a little small and had a slight breathing problem initially, she was healthy. Scott said: ""I was thinking, this is not quite what we'd planned. Our visions of us leaving hospital together in the usual romantic way with the baby seat and whatnot, suddenly that dream was decimated.""  The doctors came back and said Emma had a bleed on the brain. Scott said: ""That's never a pleasant thing. I remember just sitting there thinking, what the hell is happening. I have never felt so parched in my life.""  Scott continued: ""I felt sorrow for the fact that Emma was not only missing the events but she was potentially in a place that was going to take her out of her daughter's life for a fair while."" Broomfield Hospital isn't equipped for the specialist neurological treatment Emma needed, so she was airlifted to Queen's Hospital in Romford.  Scott said: ""She had another scan and it wasn't a pretty sight."" Emma had a tumour around 60mm long that had grown around the base of her skull and was wrapped around the spinal column underneath her brain.  Scott said: ""It was really kind of 50-50 whether she was going to make it through the night because they said the bleed could be so brutal they potentially couldn't do anything with her."" But by the next morning, Emma had stabilised and they were able to operate the next day.  (Image: Scott Weeks)  On Tuesday, November 1, Emma had surgery and two-thirds of the tumour was removed. The surgeon said Emma had not sustained any brain damage and the tumour was found to be non-cancerous.  Scott said: ""The surgeon predicted a sound recovery. With dedicated physiotherapy he saw that she should be able to live a relatively normal life with some impairment to her left side ability.""  After a few weeks, Emma started breathing by herself again and was moved off the ICU ward and back to Broomfield Hospital. It was while Emma was back at Broomfield that Scott remembers bringing Ophelia in for a dietitian appointment, and Emma had regained consciousness.  Scott said: ""It was an absolute miracle as the surgeon had said that consciousness would be her biggest hurdle because of the damage."" He explained that the right-hand brainstem, which had been damaged by the tumour, was like the brain's 'starter motor'.  Scott continued: ""So without that she could have been unconscious for the rest of her life, and that would have been it."" Emma was moved to Northwick Park hospital in north London, where she started a three-month rehabilitation programme funded by the NHS.  Emma has already made some progress in the months of rehab she's had. Emma was mostly paralysed from the neck down, but she's slowly started to regain some dexterity again, moving her thumb and fingers, then her toes.  Scott said: ""It's a very slow process. The frustrating thing is they say the rehabilitation for this kind of injury can be two years. Three months is not really enough to get someone back on their feet.""  (Image: Scott Weeks)  Emma has now been moved to a 'soft rehab', which is far less intense in supporting her recovery. Scott said: ""My problem with that is yes, eventually she should make the recovery we hope for, but it's just delaying the amount of time she's missing with her daughter. And I just didn't feel like that was a fair trade off.""  Scott says these first six months of bringing Ophelia up without Emma has been tough. He tries to involve Emma as much as he can with Ophelia, from letting her choose Ophelia's clothes to where their daughter should go to nursery.  But due to visiting times, Emma can only see Ophelia for a couple of hours a week, so Scott tries to keep Emma up to date by showing her lots of photos and videos. Scott says: ""Emma's very aware of what's going on and what she's missing. She does cry, we have some tears.""  At the moment, Emma still is unable to speak, but communicates through nodding and shaking her head, and can put her thumb up or down in agreement or disagreement. Scott said: ""She wants to be given the best shot of speeding up the process [of recovery].""  Scott has started a fundraiser to pay for Emma to continue more intensive physiotherapy privately, so she can come home in less than 12 months, he hopes. There has been a huge amount of local support, partly because Emma was so well-loved by everyone in Chelmsford, Scott said.  He said: ""She was a dedicated local dental hygienist and she'd been serving in Essex for over 10 years. I guess I'm just looking to get her the same kind of treatment she's given her patients over time.  ""I've had hundreds of them come to me and say she's amazing and donated, and that's really what I think she deserves."" Scott added: ""It's amazing that in times like this, when we put our heads together, we can achieve amazing things.  And not a lot of money from a lot of people can make a huge difference to this girl's life and her daughter's."" The fundraiser has only been running for a couple of weeks, but Scott has already raised more than £55,000 for Emma's rehab.  Emma is a very calm and caring person, Scott said, and always thoughtful and considerate of everyone around her. Scott said: ""She's a very well-liked person, and missed by everybody.""  A spokesperson for the London North West University Healthcare NHS Trust, which runs Northwick Park hospital, said: “Hyperacute rehabilitation units (HRUs) are highly specialised and patients are moved on once their medical condition is stabilised. Their ongoing treatment is not determined by resources and the handful of hospitals trusts hosting HRUs work closely with their local continuing healthcare teams to ensure their on- going rehabilitation in accordance with their needs.”  You can donate to the fundraiser here.

Edited Getty Image Edited Getty Image loading...  Wait, What Happened?  A woman who attempted to hide more than three pounds of cocaine under a fake pregnant belly has been apprehended by law enforcement officers. In the process of evading the authorities, the contraband fell out of the rubber belly that was allegedly attached to her.  So in a way, she gave birth to over 1,500 grams of cocaine.

Anderson County Sheriff's Office SC A woman was apprehended carrying a substantial amount of cocaine that was taped behind a rubber pregnancy belly.  Anderson County Sheriff's Office SC loading...  During The Traffic Stop  During a proactive patrol on April 12th, officers from the Anderson County Sheriff's Office pulled over Anthony Miller and Cemeka Mitchem, residents of Charlotte, while traveling along Interstate 85. The reason for the stop was attributed to Miller's erratic driving behavior, as he drove haphazardly, crossing lanes of traffic and nearly colliding with a semi-truck.  Public Information Officer, Shale Remien, told ABC News that Miller and Mitchem appeared apprehensive during the stop and went out of their way to inform officers that Mitchem was pregnant. Nevertheless, conflicting information regarding her due date, as well as differing details about their intended destination, alerted officers to the possibility of criminal activity.  ""The first red flag began when the two gave conflicting information about her 'due date,'"" the release from the office said.  According to police, Mitchem fled from the officers as they grew increasingly suspicious of the ""conflicting story"" offered by the couple, and in the process, drugs fell out of a rubber stomach she had been carrying.  ""Mitchem immediately took off running and very quickly drugs fell from the fake rubber stomach,"" the release noted.

Even if you focused on one mom, you probably assumed she was confident and knew how to handle her baby. After all, she's the mom and she knows what the baby wants and needs.  Then you gave birth, and you found that motherhood came with some uncertainty, fear and confusion. Sometimes, you feel that you don't always know what your little baby wants and how to satisfy their needs.  Now you know that behind every mom with a stroller or a baby carrier were long minutes of necessary organization, many things that they're not allowed to forget, and maybe even a wish that this short trip will pass without hysterical crying, diaper surprises or any stressful comments from unknown passersby.  Now a week, two weeks, or a month after giving birth you may be ready to go out with your newborn child. It can be to the baby development clinic, to the post office, for a scheduled activity or just to get fresh air. Regardless of where it is you’re going, every outing requires you to be organized physically and mentally. In order to have a great time with your baby, look at this guide.  Equip yourself with what you need, but don't overload  You won't be out for long, so don't take the entire house with you. Yet, there are some basic things that are important to have in your stroller bag, even for half an hour of walking around:  Woman walking with stroller (illustrative). (credit: Wikimedia Commons)  A few diapers, two disposable diaper pads, cream, wipes and plastic trash bags.  Clothing: dress the baby in clothes suitable for the weather and always remember to take a change of clothes with you because there will be times the baby manages to poop all over his body. It will happen, albeit hopefully not too often.  Clean blanket  Feeding: Make sure to have a blanket you can wear when nursing, a bottle of water and a can of formula with a measuring scoop. Always take extra; you might be delayed in your return home.  Two pacifiers and some small toys for them to hold while you change them.  A carrier to store in the bottom of the baby carriage or pushchair. An activity mat or blanket suitable to use outdoors.  Don't forget to look out for yourself  And it's true that the baby requires most of the things you’ll be taking with you, but don’t forget that you need a few things too.  Take with you:  A charged phone, wallet, keys and water bottle  Snacks if you don’t want to sit in a cafe  Hand sanitizer  Take into account that the baby will cry  All babies cry. Obviously, it's great if a baby sleeps or is in a good mood, but it’s entirely possible that something will upset them, and you’ll need to respond.  First- breathe deeply. Even if you don't manage to quickly calm down the baby, no one's looking at you. Block out background noise and concentrate only on you and the baby.  Plan a route but be open to changes  In order to remain calm, the first time you take the baby out, choose a route you know. Don't walk on narrow streets or those filled with pedestrians, or go places you know are too steep.  For a first walk go to a park, or quiet streets near your home. You can deviate from the planned route and walk more but remember, however far you walk, you’ll also have to walk back with the baby.  Track the weather  Winter? Make sure it isn't too cold or rainy. Summer? Don't go out if it's really hot and humid. Stay in if it's hazy or very windy.  Don't be afraid to breastfeed outside  At first, nursing in public seems impossible but you'll get used to it. Still, take a blanket to cover you and don't worry if anyone sees you nursing.  Good luck with going out with your baby, especially the first few times. You're a champion mom and everything will be fine!  This article was written in cooperation with the JAMA parenting app."

It seeks to understand how these cosmic events can influence a person’s life based on their birth date and time.  The concept of assigning different symbols for each month dates back centuries, with many ancient cultures believing that certain stones, flowers, or colors have special meanings and powers. This tradition has been passed down through generations and continues to be embraced by people around the world today.  For example, each birth month is associated with a specific flower that represents qualities that are believed to reflect the personality traits of individuals born during that month. These flowers vary from delicate lilies for those born in May to passionate roses for those born in June. Each birth flower blooms in the corresponding month, so be sure to pick a bouquet for yourself during your birth month.  Only The Top 1% Can Ace our Animal Quizzes Think You Can?

January — Carnation and Snowdrop  Carnations are one of two flowers for January. ©Diamant Studios/Shutterstock.com  As we delve into the world of birth month flowers, let us take a closer look at the carnation and snowdrop — two beautiful blooms that represent individuals born in January.  The carnation is known for its delicate beauty and subtle fragrance. This flower can come in a wide range of colors, including pink, red, white, yellow, and even purple. The petals are fringed with a unique texture that adds to their charm.  In ancient times, this flower was believed to have healing properties and was used as a remedy for various ailments such as fever or inflammation. It is also associated with love and admiration; hence it makes an ideal gift for someone you hold dear.  On the other hand, snowdrops symbolize hope and purity. These small yet elegant blossoms bloom during late winter when everything else seems dull and lifeless. They usually appear as drooping white bells accompanied by slender green leaves.  Their sweet scent has been described as having hints of honey or vanilla, which add to their allure. The snowdrop’s arrival signifies the end of winter’s harshness, giving way to new beginnings, thus making them perfect adornments for weddings or christenings.  So if you’re looking for something special to gift someone born in January or just want some lovely flowers around your home during these colder months- carnations or snowdrops may be just what you need!  February — Violet and Primrose  Primroses are beautiful flowers that symbolize new beginnings. © K.Jagielski/Shutterstock.com  For those born in February, the birth month flowers are violet and primrose. These two flowers not only offer a beautiful display of colors but also have significant meanings attached to them.  The violet is a small, delicate flower that blooms in shades of purple, blue, and white. Its petals fan out from its center, creating an intricate design that has captured the hearts of many for centuries. The plant itself grows low to the ground with heart-shaped leaves, making it perfect for borders or filler plants in garden beds. Violets are known for their sweet scent, which can range from mild to strong depending on their variety.  Primroses, on the other hand, come in various shapes and sizes but typically bloom as clusters of small flowers ranging from pale pink to deep reds and purples. They often grow taller than violets, with larger leaves resembling rosettes at times. Like violets, primroses are fragrant with scents ranging from sweet floral notes to subtle fruity undertones.  To someone born in February, the violet signifies faithfulness, loyalty, and devotion, while the primrose represents young love or new beginnings. Both qualities fit perfectly into this month’s theme, celebrating romance and renewal.  As far as blooming seasons go, violets tend to bloom early spring through late summer while primroses prefer cooler weather conditions like early spring or fall, where temperatures do not exceed 70 degrees Fahrenheit.  In conclusion: If you’re looking for a meaningful gift for your loved one born in February, consider a bouquet of violets and primroses.  March — Daffodil  New cultivars of daffodils have sweet scents. ©Tony Baggett/Shutterstock.com  Daffodils are beautiful and vibrant flowers that typically bloom in the early spring months. With their bright yellow petals and delicate trumpet-shaped centers, they are truly a sight to behold. The daffodil is known for symbolizing new beginnings, rebirth, and fresh starts — all fitting themes for those born in March who celebrate their birthday during this time of year.  In terms of fragrance, daffodils do not have a particularly strong scent, although newer cultivars are sweetly scented. However, some people describe them as having a subtle yet sweet aroma that can be quite pleasant when encountered up close.  When it comes to blooming times, daffodils typically start appearing in gardens and fields around mid-March through April, depending on the climate zone. They thrive best in moist soil conditions with plenty of sunlight exposure.  Overall, if you’re looking for a cheerful and iconic flower to represent your birth month or simply enjoy admiring nature’s beauty during the springtime season, then look no further than the lovely daffodil!  April — Sweet Pea and Daisy  Daisies are one of two flowers for the month of April. ©M9K/Shutterstock.com  As we move into April, the birth month flowers are sweet peas and daisies. Sweet peas are known for their delicate appearance and sweet fragrance. These flowers have a romantic feel to them, with their ruffled petals in shades of pink, purple, white, or red. They grow on long stems that can reach up to six feet tall and bloom from late spring to early summer.  Daisies, on the other hand, have a more simplistic look with their bright yellow center surrounded by white petals. However, they also come in different colors, such as pink or red depending on the species. daisies are often associated with innocence and purity but can also symbolize new beginnings or loyalty.  For those born in April who share these flowers as their birth month symbols, there is significant meaning behind each one. The sweet pea represents blissful pleasure, while the daisy signifies purity and innocence of heart – both traits commonly found among people born under this zodiac sign.  As for fragrance, sweet peas exude a beautiful scent that has been described as honey-like with subtle hints of fruitiness, while daisies typically do not have any scent at all.  In terms of when they bloom, sweet peas usually start blooming around late spring through early summer, whereas daisies tend to flower throughout most seasons except winter.  Overall if you’re looking for some unique yet meaningful gifts for someone special in your life born during this time period, then sweet pea and daisy bouquets may be perfect options!  May — Hawthorn and Lily of the Valley  Lily of the Valley flowers smells like honey. ©Agnes Kantaruk/Shutterstock.com  May babies have two birth month flowers to choose from — the hawthorn and lily of the valley. These stunning blooms are not only beautiful but also hold special meanings for those born in May.  The hawthorn is a small tree or shrub that produces delicate white or pink flowers in late spring. Its branches are spiny, and its leaves are lobed, creating an overall striking appearance. In terms of symbolism, the hawthorn represents hope and happiness as well as protection against evil spirits.  On the other hand, the lily of the valley is a fragrant woodland plant with bell-shaped white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. This flower symbolizes humility, sweetness, and purity. It has been used throughout history for medicinal purposes such as treating heart conditions but should be handled with care as all parts of it are poisonous if ingested.  Both these birth month flowers emit exquisite scents that can fill up any room they’re placed in! The sweet aroma of lily-of-the-valley has hints of honey, while hawthorns have notes of citrusy freshness mixed with floral undertones.  When do these blooms grace us with their presence? While both flower during May (as per tradition), hawthorns tend to begin blooming mid-May onwards, whereas lilies typically bloom towards the beginning half of this month.  In summary, May-born individuals can take pride in having two beautiful birth month flowers to represent them. The elegant hawthorn exudes optimism and protection, whilst the breathtakingly fragrant lily stands for purity and new beginnings.  June — Rose and Honeysuckle  Roses come in single or double-flowering varieties. ©Isabelle OHara/Shutterstock.com  If you’re a person born in June, your birth month flowers are the rose and honeysuckle. These two flowers have unique characteristics that make them stand out among other blooms. The rose is a classic flower that has been used for centuries to symbolize love, admiration, and beauty. It comes in various colors, such as red, pink, yellow, white, or even black.  The appearance of the rose varies depending on its species. Some roses bloom with large petals, while others have smaller ones. They also come in different shapes, like single blooms or clusters of buds. One thing they all share, though, is their sweet fragrance which can range from light to strong.  On the other hand, honeysuckles are known for their delicate tubular shape and bright colors ranging from pale yellows to deep oranges and pinks. Their sweet aroma attracts hummingbirds and bees, who help pollinate them so they can produce more flowers.  For those born in June, these two flowers hold special meanings that reflect their character traits. Roses represent love and passion, while honeysuckles signify sweetness and devotion towards family members or loved ones.  Roses typically bloom during late spring through early summer but may vary depending on where you live – some species may be available throughout the year too! Meanwhile, honeysuckles tend to blossom between the May-June period when conditions are optimal for growth.  July — Water Lily and Larkspur  Water lilies are the flower of July. ©Papp Szabolcs/Shutterstock.com  Water lilies and larkspur are the two birth month flowers for July. These flowers have unique appearances that make them stand out from other plants. Water lilies are aquatic plants with large, showy blooms that float on the surface of still or slow-moving water. They come in a range of colors, including white, pink, yellow, and red, with some varieties exhibiting delicate patterns on their petals. On the other hand, larkspur is tall and slender with spikes of small flowers ranging from blue to purple to pinkish-red.  For individuals born in July, these flowers hold special meaning. The water lily symbolizes purity of heart, while the larkspur represents strong bonds of love and affection which makes it an ideal gift for weddings or anniversaries. Both flowers exude a sweet fragrance; however, there is no definitive scent as different species may produce different aromas.  Water lilies usually bloom between June to September when temperatures are warmer, while larkspurs typically blossom in early summer through fall, depending on the climate conditions where they grow best.  August — Gladiolus and Poppy  Poppies are a symbol of everlasting life. ©MierCat Photography/Shutterstock.com  If you were born in August, the gladiolus and poppy flowers are your birth month flowers. Both of these vibrant blooms have their own unique characteristics that make them stand out amongst other flowers.  The gladiolus flower is characterized by its tall and slender stem with multiple blooms arranged in rows. This elegant flower comes in a variety of colors, including pink, red, yellow, orange, white, and purple. The meaning behind the gladiolus varies depending on the color it bears – for example, pink represents love and infatuation, while white signifies purity and innocence. Typically blooming from the late summer to early fall months (July-October), this hardy plant requires full sun exposure to thrive.  On the other hand, poppies boast their delicate petals, which come in shades of bright reds or oranges with black centers that look like buttons. Symbolizing imagination’s power over death or remembrance during wartime when remembering fallen heroes, poppies’ significance can vary based on culture as well as their location around the world, but they remain one of nature’s most beautiful offerings for those who adore them! They bloom throughout midsummer to early fall (usually June-August), providing an array of colorful hues to gardens around North America.  When it comes to scent, both flowers don’t usually emit any strong fragrance though some varieties may give off a subtle sweet aroma that attracts pollinators such as bees or butterflies towards them.  September — Morning Glory and Aster  Morning glories love to climb up fences and trellises. ©iStock.com/Wakhron  September is a special month for those born during this time as they have not just one but two beautiful birth flowers to celebrate their entry into the world. The morning glory and aster are both stunning blooms that hold unique meanings and significance.  The morning glory has an enchanting appearance with its trumpet-shaped petals that come in shades of blue, purple, pink, white, and red. This flower is known for its delicate beauty and symbolizes love, affection, mortality, rejuvenation, and rebirth. It’s also believed to represent unrequited love or even past memories.  On the other hand, asters are small daisy-like flowers with long stems that come in vibrant colors such as pink, lavender, or white. These blossoms commonly bloom from late summer through early fall, when most other plants start to fade away. Asters are associated with wisdom, faith, patience, good luck, valor, and admiration – all great qualities that September babies tend to embody themselves!  While morning glories don’t have much fragrance on their own (unless you get close enough!), some hybrids have been bred specifically for scent purposes. So if it matters enough to you, then seek out these options at your local nursery! On the other hand, asters carry a light floral aroma similar to chamomile tea which is soothing and calming.  Both flowers typically reach full bloom around mid-September, allowing them plenty of time throughout the rest of the autumn season before winter arrives. So whether you choose one type over another – or opt for both together, they are sure to brighten any fall day.  October — Marigold  Marigolds are long-blooming flowers, lasting clear until October in some areas. ©FunFamilyRu/Shutterstock.com  Marigold flowers belong to the genus Tagetes, which includes about 56 species of plants native to the Americas. These bright and cheerful flowers are known for their vibrant color and unique fragrance, which varies depending on the species.  Marigolds typically bloom in late spring or early summer, although some varieties can flower throughout the year. They are characterized by their daisy-like appearance with brightly colored petals ranging from yellow, orange, and red to maroon. The leaves of marigold plants are usually dark green and slightly hairy.  For people born in October, marigolds hold a special significance as they represent love and passion. In many cultures around the world, these flowers are also associated with celebration and joyous occasions such as weddings and festivals.  Apart from their symbolic meaning, marigolds have several practical uses as well. Their pungent aroma helps repel insects like mosquitoes and other pests that could harm garden crops. Extracts from certain types of marigold plants have also been used for medicinal purposes due to their anti-inflammatory properties.  In conclusion, marigolds are not only beautiful but versatile too – they serve both ornamental purposes in gardens while being functional at keeping pests away!  November — Chrysanthemum  Chrysanthemum blossoms are a lovely sight in the late fall. ©Volodymyr Yakovyna/Shutterstock.com  Chrysanthemums are beautiful flowers that come in a variety of colors, ranging from white and yellow to red and purple. They have a unique appearance, with many small petals clustered together in a circular shape.  For those born in November, the chrysanthemum holds special significance as it is their birth month flower. The meaning behind this flower varies depending on culture and context but typically represents optimism, joy, longevity, and good luck.  When it comes to scent, chrysanthemums do not have an overwhelming fragrance, but they do emit a subtle sweet aroma that can be enjoyed up close.  These flowers typically bloom during late summer through fall, which makes them perfect for autumn arrangements or decorations. However, certain varieties, like the Korean chrysanthemum, can bloom even into winter months.  In summary, chrysanthemums are stunning flowers known for their unique appearance and subtle sweetness. Their inclusion as November’s birth month flower adds special meaning for those with birthdays during this time of year.  December — Holly  Holly flowers and berries last throughout winter. ©EveTravels/Shutterstock.com  As we explore the birth month flowers, December brings us the beautiful holly flower. The holly plant is typically characterized by its deep green leaves and vibrant red berries that are often associated with the holiday season. Its appearance exudes a sense of festivity and joy, making it a popular decorative choice during Christmas time.  For those born in December, the holly flower holds significant meaning as it symbolizes strength and protection. This may be attributed to the plant’s ability to thrive even in harsh winter conditions, serving as a reminder for individuals born in this month to remain unyielding amidst adversity.  While not known for their fragrance, holly plants do produce small white flowers that bloom between May and June before maturing into bright red berries later in the year. These berries are not only visually stunning but also serve as an important food source for birds during wintertime when other sources of sustenance may be scarce.  Overall, the holly flower represents resilience and hopefulness — qualities that can inspire those born under its symbolic significance to persevere through challenges while maintaining a positive outlook on life.

We imagine women who come to the United States from other nations — particularly a great many in Latin America, Europe or Africa — asking some version of that question upon learning the pills are not available here for sale over the counter, as they are in 100 other countries around the globe.  Thankfully, this could soon be changing.  An advisory panel of the Food and Drug Administration has recommended that OTC sales of a particular birth control pill be allowed. Though this is only the next step in the process, with the full FDA still needing to sign off, the agency seldom bucks an advisory group’s recommendation.  Sales without a prescription are likely coming soon and that is a good development.  After the Supreme Court last year overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that made abortion legal in all 50 states, the need for women to be able to secure birth control pills as easily as possible became more pressing than ever.  But for far too many women, obtaining pills is anything but straightforward.  The FDA advisory panel has recommended that Opill, a daily contraceptive made by HRA Pharma, be made available for sale over the counter. Though this move involves just one pill, another company that manufactures another birth control pill has also applied for sales over the counter. For the sake of all women, this should be only the start, with other companies offering their own pills following suit, and FDA approval becoming increasingly routine.  This is an issue for all women, but it is of particular importance for those who lack significant financial resources and for women of color. If poorer Black and Hispanic women cannot gain access to birth control pills, while more well-to-do white women can, that’s patently unjust.  Every woman — white, Black, Hispanic, native American, rich, poor, you name it — needs to have access to birth control pills. Without a prescription.  This ought not be controversial."

Giving birth to my third child, I agreed to let five students — in addition to a midwife, my husband, and my parents on Facetime — observe me in this very vulnerable moment, something I couldn't have imagined years before.  8 Kimberly Gladden-Eversley let nine people watch her give birth to her third child Credit: Courtesy Kimberly Gladden-Eversley  8 She admitted she wasn't always so comfortable with her body, but she realized: 'Body positivity starts with me' Credit: Courtesy Kimberly Gladden-Eversley  The body positivity movement has garnered the attention of women around the globe who desperately want acceptance — and yes, I was one of them.  From trendy diets, hour-long Tik Tok-worthy skincare routines, and waist trainers that will suck the life out of you — if you have seen it, I’ve probably tried it.  Despite the efforts of this movement, filtered photos, carefully angled poses, and edited bodies continue to take over our social media newsfeeds — and I admit, I've done it plenty of times.  I was body-shamed for not having note-worthy curves like Beyonce or the voluptuous genes that led to our obsession with plastic surgery.  So here I was, in my early 20s, forcibly poking out what my mama never gave me, hoping to generate likes and approval from an audience who would forget my existence by their next newsfeed scroll.  It wasn’t until seven years ago, when I was in labor during my third pregnancy, that I realized body positivity starts with me.  As I felt like I was splitting in half while I naturally fought through each contraction, my midwife asked if she could invite her med students into my delivery room.  Impressed by my laboring skills, she looked at me and said: “Kimberly, you are doing amazing. Would it be ok if I invite my med students in the room?”  You probably think I would never spread it wide for the world to see and told her: ""No way!""  Well, yes way, and without hesitation, I agreed.  After two back-to-back natural deliveries prior to this one, I felt like a purple-heart medal-wearing veteran ready for battle.  At this point, I could take on anything because fear had officially left the building, and my body had already proven how powerful it was before.  Within minutes, my quiet delivery room turned into a classroom with at least five students staring at my bare body.  Each student walked into the room wearing a permanent smile, exuding nervous excitement while anxiously preparing to witness their first live childbirth.  8 When her midwife asked if several students could come in and watch her give birth, she agreed Credit: Courtesy Kimberly Gladden-Eversley  In between contractions, we’d make eye contact that was complemented by reassuring words of encouragement: “You got this,” “You were so made for this,” “Wow, she is amazing.”  Eagerly standing in my room, we represented beauty in its natural form without an ounce of makeup, fake eyelashes, or selfie-worthy attire.  As I took off each layer of clothing, preparing to bring life into the world, I could feel the insecurities about my appearance quickly slip away.  I didn’t worry about the harsh judgment I’d receive or their thoughts about my body.  I wasn’t as concerned about my disproportionate curves or my nose, which had recently doubled in size as much as I was just a week ago.  I didn’t care about the pregnancy acne I’d cover up before posting with too much lighting and overly saturated filters.  I wasn’t concerned if anyone would pick me apart until nothing was left.  8 'Admittedly, the intensity of the pain increased my disconnection from the world around me,' she said Credit: Courtesy Kimberly Gladden-Eversley  I was too focused on the mission and massively in tune with the present moment, carefully monitoring each stage of labor as it rapidly progressed.  Admittedly, the intensity of the pain increased my disconnection from the world around me.  I probably wouldn’t have cared if Oprah decided to show up with a team of cameras for a feature on The Masterclass.  You probably think I would never spread it wide for the world to see and told her: ""No way!"" Well, yes way, and without hesitation, I agreed.  I felt powerful, called, liberated, and, most importantly, free.  The girl who was called “too skinny” suddenly had hips wide enough to deliver a baby safely and naturally for the third time.  The girl with acne-prone skin that required good lighting and concealer suddenly had skin strong enough to carry a full-term baby.  The girl, whose legs were called sticks, could stand tall, completely nude, while pushing with the help of gravity.  If you're wondering, yes, I gave birth while standing.  8 She sat in a birthing pool with her husband before standing up to deliver her daughter Credit: Courtesy Kimberly Gladden-Eversley  After sitting in a birthing pool for about thirty minutes, supported by my adoring husband, I could feel my contractions getting stronger.  My baby girl’s head was finally making its way further down the birth canal, and after months of research, I decided that gravity would offer me the best assistance.  As I got up, I could sense the hesitancy in the room, wondering if I’d finally gone mad or if my calm demeanor was a temporary act.  I saw random tremoring hands reaching out, ready to assist me from the birthing pool to the bed.  Without giving careful instruction, after I made my way to the bed, which felt like the longest walk ever, I crouched over, using the mattress as my support, and bore down, ready to push.  My midwife got on her knees, ready to catch my baby, and within minutes, her sweet cries filled the room, totaling my delivery time to over an hour and thirty minutes.  Shocked by my speedy delivery, my midwife jokingly informed her students that their short hour in the delivery room was not a typical day for a midwife.  8 'Who knew giving birth to my daughter would also deliver radiating confidence I never thought was possible?' she said Credit: Courtesy Kimberly Gladden-Eversley  The students, who were still speechless from the entire ordeal, managed to thank me for allowing them to bear witness to one of the most vulnerable moments of my life.  Honestly, I wanted to thank them for being there because I needed them more than they’d ever know.  Years of shouting body-positivity affirmations while staring at myself in the mirror, hoping no one would catch me seemingly talking to myself.  Or the times my friends and I would blast songs about women empowerment while singing like an audition for America’s Got Talent.  I probably wouldn’t have cared if Oprah decided to show up with a team of cameras for a feature on The Masterclass  None of it overpowered the hurling insults we’d hear about our bodies that “missed the mark.”  Overall, my level of comfort in my skin took a lot of emotional work and, apparently, physical pain during hours of labor in a crowded room.  Who knew giving birth to my daughter would also deliver radiating confidence I never thought was possible after years of listening to self-help audiobooks on laundry days?  I began to realize I was enough; in fact, I was more than enough to carry life for nine months, to nourish another body, and shockingly, my small breasts were enough to feed my baby for her entire first year of life.  8 Five students, Kimberly's husband, and her parents all watched her delivery Credit: Courtesy Kimberly Gladden-Eversley  Since then, I’ve embodied a sense of unfathomable bravery and was proud of my body from all angles.  I spent less time editing photos, less time working on my pose, and retired my filter button, vowing never to look back.  Let’s face it — after three children, who has time for that anyway?  All the work we put into achieving the picture-perfect body feels like a full-time job that doesn’t pay much.  So, I quit and didn’t give a two-week notice or write a resignation letter.  I proudly shifted jobs for a fulfilling life as a wife, mother, content creator, and gateway for future generations.  Some may falsely assume that my sudden transformation was due to the intensity of birthing pain that can naturally lead to psychological disassociation.  But something happened that day, changing my life forever, which gave birth to my daughter and a version of me that I’ve always aspired to be.  8 Now she's expecting baby number five and said: 'I’ve decided to extend an invitation to my labor and delivery room once again' Credit: Courtesy Kimberly Gladden-Eversley  I was able to experience life beyond fear while remaining present and comfortable in my skin.  My past insecurities were let go with the clothing on the floor that once hid my false perception of beauty.  Fast forward to today, as I prepare for the birth of baby number five, I’ve decided to extend an invitation to my labor and delivery room once again.  Making a conscious decision without pain or requests from my current midwife.  Sure, I’m 30 pounds heavier than I was seven years ago, I’ve accumulated more stretch marks than I could count, and my breasts look like they’ve seen better days.  Nevertheless, I am in love with the body I was given; I’m mesmerized by all the things it can do, and you should too.  As we witness our modern-day sex icons melt away their plastic surgery and Botox, it’s time for us to melt away our debilitating insecurities.  So, in the words of Taylor Swift, shake it off, and let’s redefine beauty together.  I want nothing more than to share my newfound courage and hope it continues to spread like wildfire."

Every 40 seconds, one of those babies dies. In the last decade, preterm birth rates have not changed in any region of the world. Coverage is highly inequitable and challenges disproportionately affect those most vulnerable. For example, nearly 1 in 10 preterm babies are born in the 10 most fragile countries affected by humanitarian crises where accessing care is particularly challenging.  A new report – Born Too Soon: Decade of Action on preterm birth – has highlighted that while encouraging progress has been made to prevent and protect preterm birth, much more concerted action is needed. Published at the International Maternal Newborn Health Conference (IMNHC) in Cape Town, South Africa, Born too soon sounds the alarm on the silent emergency of preterm birth, long under-recognised in its scale and severity, which is impeding progress in improving children’s health and survival.  The report has been produced by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) together with PMNCH – the world’s largest alliance for women, children and adolescents.  A pledge from leaders in women’s health and rights  As a member of the PMNCH Health-Care Professional Associations (HCPA) constituency, FIGO has come together with the Council of International Neonatal Nurses (COINN), International Confederation of Midwives (ICM), International Council of Nurses (ICN) and International Paediatric Association (IPA) have issued a joint statement to wholeheartedly commit to work together to take bold action to reduce the burden of preterm birth in the coming decade.  On the urgent need for collaborative action, Director of FIGO’s Division of Maternal and Newborn Health Professor Bo Jacobsson, said:  The inequities in coverage and quality of health services for women around the world are hindering progress towards the prevention of preterm births and stillbirths. Health care professionals have a key role to play as part of multi-stakeholder efforts to scale-up proven tools and resources aimed at the prevention of preterm birth, and to ensure women and families receive high quality, respectful and person-centred care.  FIGO and our partners re-affirm our commitment that all women and families receive respectful, person-centred care, and that women’s and adolescents’ voices are respected. Through the joint statement, we call upon our governments to support us in this critical work and invest in strengthening the health workforce so that skilled health care providers are comprehensively available to be able to ensure respectful high quality care reaches every mother and family  Partnership and people power  A decade on from the 2012 Born Too Soon report, more than 70 organisations have come together to develop an updated report. The report has been developed by more than 140 individuals from 46 countries, spanning national governments, civil society, including parents’ groups, health-care professional associations, young people, academic and research organisations, multilateral organisations, donors and foundations, and the private sector. Parents and families have shared their deeply personal experiences of preterm birth; a moving reminder that behind every statistic is a story of a family and a community deeply impacted, often for a lifetime.  The 2023 report is a testament to the power of partnership. Together, we are united in our call for a healthier and more equitable future for millions of babies, women and families.  Ensuring quality care for these tiniest, most vulnerable babies and their families is absolutely imperative for improving child health and survival. Progress is also needed to help prevent preterm births – this means every woman must be able to access quality health services before and during pregnancy to identify and manage risks. – Dr Anshu Banerjee, Director for Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health and Ageing, WHO  To make progress on maternal and newborn health, we must address preterm birth. Please share the report widely with your networks, partners, colleagues and friends. Together, we have all the ingredients for success.  More about the report  The report includes updated estimates from WHO and UNICEF, prepared with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, on the prevalence of preterm births. Overall, it finds that preterm birth rates have not changed in any region in the world in the past decade, with 152 million vulnerable babies born too soon from 2010 to 2020.  Image  Preterm birth is now the leading cause of child deaths, accounting for more than 1 in 5 of all deaths of children occurring before their 5th birthday. Preterm survivors can face lifelong health consequences, with an increased likelihood of disability and developmental delays.  The report notes that only 1 in 10 extremely preterm babies (<28 weeks) survive in low-income countries, compared to more than 9 in 10 in high-income countries. Gaping inequalities related to race, ethnicity, income, and access to quality care determine the likelihood of preterm birth, death, and disability, even in high-income countries.  Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa have the highest rates of preterm birth, and preterm babies in these regions face the highest mortality risk. Together, these two regions account for more than 65% of preterm births globally. The report also highlights that the impacts of conflict, climate change and environmental damage, COVID-19, and rising living costs are increasing risks for women and babies everywhere. For example, air pollution is estimated to contribute to 6 million preterm births each year. Nearly 1 in 10 preterm babies are born in the 10 most fragile countries affected by humanitarian crises, according to a new analysis in the report.  Maternal health risks, such as adolescent pregnancy and pre-eclampsia, are closely linked to preterm births. This underlines the need to ensure access to sexual and reproductive health services, including effective family planning, with high-quality care in pregnancy and around the time of birth."

Hello Abel Tesfaye.  The ""Can't Feel My Face"" singer may soon start going by his birth name, he told W magazine in a story published on May 8.  “I’m going through a cathartic path right now,” the 33-year-old singer said.  “It’s getting to a place and a time where I’m getting ready to close The Weeknd chapter,"" he explained. ""I’ll still make music, maybe as Abel, maybe as The Weeknd. But I still want to kill The Weeknd. And I will, eventually. I’m definitely trying to shed that skin and be reborn.”  Get Connecticut local news, weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox. Sign up for NBC Connecticut newsletters.  The Canadian singer said he came to the decision while working on his new show, ""The Idol,"" a drama series he co-created and stars in. The series, which co-stars Lily-Rose Depp as a pop star named Jocelyn, premieres on HBO on June 4.  While bringing his character Tedros to life for a scene filmed at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles last fall, the ""Die For You"" singer said he had trouble oscillating between himself and the role. Tedros is described in a synopsis as ""a self-help guru and leader of a modern day cult.""  “I had to take off The Weeknd outfit, put on Tedros’ wig, shoot with Jocelyn, then go back to being The Weeknd,” he recalled to W. “It was tough to go from one head to another.""  The singer said the peak of how jarring the experience was for him was when he lost his voice after filming the scene, which was shot during an actual Weeknd concert.  ""Then, after the concert, I lost my voice,"" he said. ""No voice came out at all. That’s never happened before.""  ""My theory is that I forgot how to sing because I was playing Tedros, a character who doesn’t know how to sing,"" he said. ""I may be looking too deeply into this, but it was terrifying.""  He said the experience prompted deep introspection. In September, The Weeknd cancelled the second show of a two-night run in Los Angeles after he lost his voice, NBC News reported at the time.  ""As The Weeknd, I’ve never skipped a concert,"" he said. ""I’ve performed with the flu. I’ll die on that stage.

What ever happened to teaching our children abstinence and responsibility, instead of the “feel good society” we live in today? God’s law commands, “Do Not Commit Adultery”. Period. Married couples can seek a “Natural Family Planning” program by consulting their church and a doctor. God’s reproductive rights, given to married men and women is a beautiful gift.  The birth control pill, in many cases, prevents the fertilized egg from attaching to it’s home, the uterus, and thus flushes it out of the mother’s body. It is just another form of murdering our babies.  It has been said the our country needs more people, therefore the immigrants should be welcomed into our country. If we would “not” have allowed “abortion” to murder 64 million of our babies (legal citizens) in the past 50 years, we would have 64 million more productive people in our USA today!  As we celebrate “Mother’s Day”, we acknowledge the disastrous leadership of Gov.

Governments in the region are spending hundreds of billions of dollars trying to reverse the trend. Will it work?  Japan began introducing policies to encourage couples to have more children in the 1990s. South Korea started doing the same in the 2000s, while Singapore's first fertility policy dates back to 1987.  China, which has seen its population fall for the first time on 60 years, recently joined the growing club.  While it is difficult to quantify exactly how much these policies have cost, South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol recently said his country had spent more than $200bn (£160bn) over the past 16 years on trying to boost the population.  Yet last year South Korea broke its own record for the world's lowest fertility rate, with the average number of babies expected per woman falling to 0.78.  In neighbouring Japan, which had record low births of fewer than 800,000 last year, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has pledged to double the budget for child-related policies from 10tn yen ($74.7bn; £59.2bn), which is just over 2% of the country's gross domestic product.  Globally, while there are more countries that are trying to lower birth rates, the number of countries wanting to increase fertility has more than tripled since 1976, according to the most recent report by the United Nations.  China ditched its one-child policy in 2016  So why do these governments want to grow their populations?  Simply put, having a bigger population who can work and produce more goods and services leads to higher economic growth. And while a larger population can mean higher costs for governments, it can also result in bigger tax revenues.  Also, many Asian countries are ageing rapidly. Japan leads the pack with nearly 30% of its population now over the age of 65 and some other nations in the region are not far behind.  Compare that with India, which has just overtaken China as the world's most populous nation. More than a quarter of its people are between the age of 10 and 20, which gives its economy huge potential for growth.  Story continues  And when the share of the working age population gets smaller, the cost and burden of looking after the non-working population grow.  ""Negative population growth has an impact on the economy, and combined that with an ageing population, they won't be able to afford to support the elderly,"" said Xiujian Peng of Victoria University.  Graphic showing China's birthrate per 1,000 people, from 1978 to 2022. There has been a steady decline in recent years. The figure in 1978 was 18.25, while it was 6.77 in 2022.  Most of the measures across the region to increase birth rates have been similar: payments for new parents, subsidised or free education, extra nurseries, tax incentives and expanded parental leave.  But do these measures work?  Data for last few decades from Japan, South Korea and Singapore shows that attempts to boost their populations have had very little impact. Japan's finance ministry has published a study which said the policies were a failure.  It is a view echoed by the United Nations.  ""We know from history that the types of policies which we call demographic engineering where they try to incentivise women to have more babies, they just don't work,"" Alanna Armitage of United Nations Population Fund told the BBC.  ""We need to understand the underlying determinants of why women are not having children, and that is often the inability of women to be able to combine their work life with their family life,"" she added.  But in Scandinavian countries, fertility policies have worked better than they did in Asia, according to Ms Peng.  ""The main reason is because they have a good welfare system and the cost of raising children is cheaper. Their gender equality is also much more balanced than in Asian countries.""  Asian countries have ranked lower in comparison in the global gender gap report by the World Economic Forum.  Japan has the highest debt in the G7  There are also major questions over how these expensive measures should be funded, especially in Japan, which is the world's most indebted developed economy.  Options under consideration in Japan include selling more government bonds, which means increasing its debt, raising its sales tax or increasing social insurance premiums.  The first option adds financial burden to the future generations, while the other two would hit already struggling workers, which could convince them to have fewer children.  But Antonio Fatás, professor of economics at INSEAD says regardless of whether these policies work, they have to invest in them.  ""Fertility rates have not increased but what if there was less support? Maybe they would be even lower,"" he said.  Governments are also investing in other areas to prepare their economies for shrinking populations.  ""China has been investing in technologies and innovations to make up for the declining labour force in order to mitigate the negative impact of the shrinking population,"" said Ms Peng.  Also, while it remains unpopular in countries like Japan and South Korea, lawmakers are discussing changing their immigration rules to try to entice younger workers from overseas.  ""Globally, the fertility rate is falling so it'll be a race to attract young people to come and work in your country,"" Ms Peng added.  Whether the money is well spent on fertility policies, these governments appear to have no other choice."

The critically endangered pups were born on April 28, 2023, and are the offspring of four-year-old Gloria and three-year-old Oak, both first-time parents.  The nine pups – eight females and one male – are all healthy and doing well. The Nature Center’s veterinary care team carefully monitors the newborns during these critical first weeks. At just two weeks old, these pups are still wholly dependent on their parents, but Gloria and Oak have been seen moving them around the habitat, so guests may sporadically see them. The pups may begin venturing out of the den box around the end of May, and guests may begin to see the pups in the red wolf habitat in June. The WNC Nature Center’s social media channels will share updates on the progress of the pups.  Background:  Parents Gloria and Oak were paired in January 2023 based on a breeding recommendation from the Red Wolf SAFE (Saving Animals From Extinction) program of the Association of Zoos & Aquariums. SAFE is a collaborative effort between zoos and other conservation organizations to protect and recover the red wolf population through habitat restoration, genetically diverse breeding, and reintroducing red wolves into their natural habitat. Gloria was born in April 2019 at the Endangered Wolf Center in Missouri and Oak was born at the NC Zoo in Asheboro in April 2020.  By participating in this program, the WNC Nature Center is making a significant contribution to the conservation of this critically endangered species. “The WNC Nature Center is honored to be a part of the American red wolf conservation effort,” said WNC Nature Center Director Chris Gentile, “and we are so proud of Gloria and Oak for playing such an essential role in helping their species recover.”  American red wolves are native to North America and are one of the most endangered canine species in the world. In April 2023, the US Fish & Wildlife Service estimated that there are only 15 to 17 red wolves living in the wild in Eastern North Carolina. Red wolves in the SAFE program under human care numbered 235. The WNC Nature Center has been part of the American Red Wolf Recovery Program since 1990. Between 1996 and 2014, 13 pups were born at the Nature Center. This year’s litter brings that total to 22.  Community support:  Community members and supporters of red wolf conservation also have a role to play. With a pack of 11 red wolves at the WNC Nature Center, the community can help support a local effort to save these critically endangered animals. Donations can be made online at www.wildwnc.org/donate or mailed to Friends of the WNC Nature Center, PO Box 19151, Asheville, NC, 28815.  The WNC Nature Center connects people of all ages with the plants and animals of the Southern Appalachian Mountains. Asheville’s wildlife park is located on 42 acres at 75 Gashes Creek Road and is home to more than 60 species of animals, including red pandas, river otters, black bears, and red and gray wolves.

Grady gave birth to five daughters. The first two were born in a hospital, but then she had a change of heart.  “There had been no trauma at the hospital births, and I have no idea where this thought originated, but I wanted to have the next baby at my friend’s home,” said Grady and laughed. “I had to look up 'Midwives' in the Yellow Pages.

It was transformative and stirred a passion in me.”  Download the Napa Valley Register's free news app Easily access the very latest local news that matters in an app built for you. Read, see, and hear exclusive commentary, stunning photography,…  All California midwives must be licensed with the California Medical Board to practice. Grady got her education at the National Midwifery Institute and is a Licensed Midwife (LM) with a national certification as a Certified Professional Midwife (CPM).  Grady runs the facility alongside the center’s executive director, husband Darren Grady. Also on the team is colleague Deborah (Fawn) Studebaker, LM, CPM. The center partners with midwife assistants and students, a lactation consultant, pregnancy and childbirth educators and consultant OB/GYN doctors.  The Napa center is located at 525 Lincoln Ave. and the Santa Rosa center (formerly Thrive Center for Birth and Family Wellness) is at 4859 Old Redwood Highway (themidwives.com). Should the need arise, they also work with nearby hospitals.  Natural childbirth is a vaginal birth involving no medical interventions such as forceps, vacuums, or epidurals. Medically trained professionals such as licensed midwives and doulas are available to assist with natural childbirth, whether the birth itself takes place in a hospital, stand-alone birthing center, or at home.  The American Association of Birth Centers describes birth centers as “a safe, alternative, choice 'in-between' home and hospital; a facility designed to support natural labor and delivery, supported by highly trained midwives and skilled staff, offering a family-centered, relaxed, calm, non-institutional experience.”  The Napa Valley and Sonoma Valley Birth Centers offer pre-natal care and childbirth attendance, along with emergency equipment and supplies if needed, and postpartum visits. The birth centers can also assist with home births, water births and doulas.  “There is a difference between midwives and doulas,” said Paula Grady. “A doula provides emotional and physical care, and postpartum support for the mother. As licensed midwives, we can provide medical care, order lab work such as ultrasound, and make medical decisions. Doulas don't provide medical care.”  Grady said that during natural birth, 99% of the mothers opt for using a birth tub, at least for part of the process. “I’d say that 75- 80% experience water births.” The birth centers have tubs available.  According to the Peterson-Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) Health System Tracker, hospital childbirth costs an average of $18,865 nationwide, which includes pregnancy, delivery and postpartum care. The International Federation of Health Plans says our state is higher, “California is particularly expensive… with hospitals there charging an average of $26,380 for mothers to give birth to their child.”  The cost for the Midwives Childbirth Services is $7,500, with discount options and payment plans. Most insurance PPO plans cover at least part of birth center childbirths, HMOs may not.  The midwives said that the best candidates for a natural birth are “normal, healthy moms with normal, healthy babies.”  “Mothers feel safe and comfortable with us,” said Paula Grady. “They know the birth team will take good care of them. It’s an emotional, mental event and a big transformation.”  Studebaker added that natural childbirth is an excellent option for first-time mothers. “I’d say it’s better for first-time moms; in fact, it’s vital.”  Prior to the opening of the Sonoma Valley Birth Center, Rhiannon Sanders of Guerneville had her first child in February. She chose Paula and the Napa Valley Birth Center for the delivery.  “Early in my pregnancy, I didn’t know what the experience would be like,” said Sanders. “I went to an OB/GYN thinking they’d give me an education; information about what I should be eating and so on. I got none of that. As soon as I met Paula, though, she gave me a large booklet on what I could expect week by week. By then, I was far along at 35 weeks.”  “Originally, I thought I’d give birth at home, but when I saw the Napa Valley Birth Center, it looked as pleasant and comfortable as my own home. Since I live over an hour and a half away, I was concerned about the drive while in labor. Paula said I could come during early labor and just hang out. That reassured me. I think for first-time moms, the birth center is a happy medium between a hospital and home birth. It’s great to have all the resources right there.”  Darren Grady summed up what was important for people who want to have a natural birth. “With the recent closing of several hospital Labor and Delivery departments, North Bay mamas do have alternatives to a hospital birth,” he said in an email. “A stand-alone birth center is becoming even more viable as a safe, supportive setting for pregnancy and childbirth. Paula and the midwives can provide midwifery care and a natural birth experience at the Napa Valley Birth Center in Napa or the Sonoma Valley Birth Center in Santa Rosa.”  Photos: Take a look inside the Napa Valley Birth Center"

HE HAS AN UPDATE TODAY ON HER SON AND HOW THAT FATEFUL DAY HAS COME FULL CIRCLE A DECADE LATER. LOOKING BACK TEN YEARS LATER, SHAYLA TAYLOR SAYS STORMS, ESPECIALLY TORNADOES, WERE THE LAST THING ON HER MIND AS SHE STARTED HER DAY ON MAY 20TH, 2013. THAT’S BECAUSE TAYLOR WAS SCHEDULED TO BE INDUCED TO GIVE BIRTH TO HER SECOND SON. THAT AFTERNOON. SEVERE WEATHER, TORNADOES, NOTHING LIKE THAT WAS ON MY MIND AT ALL, WAS GO IN, HAVE A BABY, GO HOME. AND THAT’S THE END OF IT. AS IT TURNED OUT, HER DELIVERY WAS ANYTHING BUT THAT SIMPLE. AS SHE GOT TO MOORE MEDICAL CENTER, HER DOCTORS AND NURSES KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ON THE WEATHER FORECASTS. AS IT WAS PREDICTED, STRONG STORMS COULD BE FORMING THAT AFTERNOON WHEN I GOT THERE, THE DOCTOR TOLD ME THAT SHE WAS GOING TO CHECK THE WEATHER AND SEE IF I WAS ACTUALLY IN ACTIVE LABOR OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE THERE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE BAD WEATHER THAT DAY. WHATEVER THE WEATHER, THE BABY WAS WELL ON ITS WAY. AND TAYLOR WAS GIVEN AN EPIDURAL, WHICH MEANS THAT SHE CAN NO LONGER MOVE HERSELF FREELY. SHORTLY AFTER, THAT’S WHEN THINGS OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL TOOK A TURN FOR THE WORST. A TORNADO EMERGENCY WAS ISSUED AROUND MAYBE TWO OR SO. THEY COME IN AND SAY THAT WE’RE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE COVER AND MY FAMILY IS GOING TO HAVE TO GO DOWNSTAIRS TO THE CAFETERIA. I CAN’T GO ANYWHERE BECAUSE, LIKE I SAID, I CAN’T GET OUT OF BED. A RARE F5 TORNADO WAS HEADING RIGHT TOWARDS MOORE MEDICAL CENTER. DOCTORS AND NURSES RUSHING TO GET TAYLOR TO A SAFE SPOT. THEY DECIDE THEY’RE GOING TO HAVE TO MOVE ME TO THE PLACE WHERE THERE’S NO WINDOWS AS CLOSE AWAY FROM THE OUTSIDE OF THE BUILDING AS THEY CAN, WHICH ENDED UP BEING THE OR JUST MINUTES LATER, THAT MASSIVE TORNADO HIT THE HOSPITAL HEAD ON, DESTROYING THE BUILDING AROUND HER. A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THAT, YOU HEAR LIKE A SILENCE OR LIKE A TRAIN OR WHATEVER WHEN TORNADOES COME THROUGH. BUT IT WAS MORE OF A SILENT THING, LIKE YOU DIDN’T REALLY HEAR ANYTHING. YOU JUST SAW EVERYTHING KIND OF FALLING AROUND YOU. THIS IS A PHOTO OF WHAT WAS LEFT OF THE O.R. WHERE TAYLOR WAS HUNKERED DOWN. YOU CAN SEE THE DEBRIS AND DESTRUCTION ALL AROUND WHEN IT WAS ACTUALLY HITTING WAS WHEN I WAS THE MOST SCARED. TAYLOR AND HER FAMILY SURVIVED. BUT EVEN WITH THE DESTRUCTION AROUND THEM, THAT DIDN’T CHANGE THE FACT THAT SHE WAS GOING TO GIVE BIRTH VERY SOON. SHE NEEDED TO GET TO SAFETY. THAT WAS A TASK IN ITSELF BECAUSE I’M UPSTAIRS AND I SAID ALL THE HALLWAYS ARE DARK. EVEN WHEN THEY CARRIED ME DOWN ON THE BACKBOARD, IT WAS DARK GOING DOWN THE STAIRS. YOU KNOW, YOU’RE JUST KIND OF LOOKING AROUND. YOU CAN’T REALLY SEE MUCH OF ANYTHING. SO THE FIRST LIGHT I ACTUALLY SAW WAS ONCE WE GOT OUTSIDE OF THE HOSPITAL, ONCE SHE WAS OUTSIDE, TAYLOR SAYS, SHE STARTED TO REALIZE THE TRUE MAGNITUDE OF THE STORM. IT WAS MUDDY. THERE WAS THERE WERE TREES AND DEBRIS EVERYWHERE. THERE WERE CARS AND STUFF KIND OF EVERYWHERE. SO I KNEW THAT IT WAS PRETTY BAD. SHE WAS THEN RUSHED TO NORMAN REGIONAL HOSPITAL, WHERE SHE SUCCESSFULLY GAVE BIRTH AT 7:30 P.M. TO HER SECOND SON, BRADEN. HE WILL BE TEN AND HE HE’S DOING GOOD. HE’S IN FOURTH GRADE NOW. HE KNOWS A LOT ABOUT THE DAY HE WAS BORN. SO WE TALK ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME. A DECADE LATER. AND TAYLOR SAYS IT’S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT SO MUCH TIME HAS ALREADY PASSED. COMING UP ON TEN YEARS FEELS A LITTLE SURREAL, LIKE IT DOESN’T FEEL LIKE IT’S BEEN TEN YEARS SINCE THE TORNADO HAPPENED. OF COURSE, MY DAILY REMINDER IS MY CHILD, TAYLOR, USING HER UNIQUE DELIVERY EXPERIENCE TO HELP OTHERS SOON TO BE MOMS. TODAY, SHE’S NOW A NURSE AT THE VERY HOSPITAL WHERE SHE GAVE BIRTH AT NORMAN REGIONAL HOSPITAL. IT’S DEFINITELY COME FULL CIRCLE. I WORK IN LABOR AND DELIVERY, WHICH I ABSOLUTELY LOVE. IN FACT, SHE EVEN WORKS WITH THAT SAME DOCTOR WHO DELIVERED BRADEN. SHE DIDN’T REALIZE WHO I WAS FOR A WHILE BECAUSE I NEVER TOLD HER. AND THEN ONE DAY SHE JUST WALKS UP TO ME AND SHE’S LIKE, YOU’RE SHAYLA, AREN’T YOU? AND I WAS LIKE, YEAH. AND SO SHE STARTS SHOWING ME PICTURES THAT SHE HAD FROM THE HOSPITAL AND STUFF. AND SO WE JUST KIND OF SHARED OUR PICTURES AND I TOLD HER THANK YOU, EVEN THOUGH SO MANY PEOPLE LOST SO MUCH ON MAY 20TH, 2013, A GLIMMER OF HOPE AND A MIRACLE ALSO TOOK PLACE THAT DAY, SOMETHING TAYLOR SAYS SHE WILL NEVER TAKE FOR GRANTED. I THINK ABOUT ALL THE LIVES THAT WERE LOST THAT DAY. AND OF COURSE, I’M BLESSED TO HAVE A MIRACLE OUT OF THE SITUATION.

I hate to use “Lynchian,” a term frequently — and slovenly — invoked for films with a merely surrealist bent. But Schaefer’s film, also steeped in a distinctly American nostalgia, more than deserves the description.  In this uncanny indie, we’re plunged into an American no-place, where a suburban father, Daryl (Paul Sparks), plans to open a diner despite not having any money; and where a former actress named Monica (Constance Shulman, channeling Norma Desmond in “Sunset Boulevard”) prepares for a big interview that will never happen. Opposite these tragic figures is Daryl’s wife, Diane (Annie Parisse), and Monica’s daughter Marlene (Gus Birney) — two women worn down by the follies of their loved ones."

Then she asks if any of the students has ever seen a woman give birth. Most have not.  Curious about how cultural attitudes and expectations affect the physical experience of childbirth and its outcomes, Dr. Thayer began a study to assess the prevalence of tokophobia, the medical term for a pathological fear of childbirth.  Though tokophobia has been well studied in Scandinavian countries, some of which screen pregnant women and offer treatment for it, little research has been done in the United States. Dr. Thayer’s online survey of nearly 1,800 American women found that in the early days of the pandemic, tokophobia may have affected the majority of American women: 62 percent of pregnant respondents reported high levels of fear and worry about childbirth.  The results were published last month in the journal Evolution, Medicine, and Public Health.  Other scientists who study childbirth said the levels of fear in the United States were higher than those reported in Europe and Australia, which are lower than 20 percent. But they noted that birthing conditions in the United States are different and that pandemic circumstances may have exacerbated fears."

In addition to these findings, the reports recorded a net-gain in population to rural parts of the commonwealth through in-migration.  The reports, released by the Center for Rural Pennsylvania, a state legislative agency for rural policy, use data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Health, to better understand the commonwealth’s rural areas, including who is moving into — and out of — them.  In-Migration/Out-Migration  Data from the U.S. Census Bureau shows that in 2021, more than 144,900 people moved into rural Pennsylvania and approximately 123,300 moved out. This movement resulted in a net gain of approximately 21,600 new residents, down from 21,800 in 2019.  The report found that the majority of people (52%) moving to rural Pennsylvania, were from out-of-state.  In fact, more than 54% of the people moving to rural Pennsylvania came from neighboring states New York, New Jersey and Maryland.  Another 41% of the people who moved to rural areas of the commonwealth came from its urban areas, compared to 2019 when 38% came from urban Pennsylvania.  Lastly, 7% of the people who moved to rural Pennsylvania came from outside of the United States.  Of those who left rural Pennsylvania, 53% went to other states, compared to 61% in 2019.  Fifty-one percent of those moved to one of the following five states: Florida, New York, Maryland, North Carolina and South Carolina.  Additionally, 47% of those who moved out of rural Pennsylvania relocated to urban areas in 2021.  The report identified working adults and college students as the two largest demographic groups driving in-migration to rural areas of the commonwealth.  Working adults between the ages of 18 and 64 made up 40% of the people who moved out of rural Pennsylvania and 37% of those who moved into rural areas.  College students made up 22% of those who moved into rural Pennsylvania and 18% of those who moved out, according to the report.  Birth & Death Rates  From 2010 to 2020, deaths outnumbered births in rural Pennsylvania, accounting for the loss of nearly 85,000 residents.  Nationally, the birth rate from 2010 to 2020 was 12.13 per 1,000 residents, according to census data.  At 10.87 births per 1,000 residents, Pennsylvania had one of the nation’s lowest birth rates over the same time period with only eight states having lower birth rates.  In rural Pennsylvania, the birth rate was lower than the statewide rate at 9.17 births per 1,000 residents.  The report found that Wayne, Centre, Sullivan, Pike and Forest counties had the lowest birth rates with each having rates below 8 births per 1,000 residents.  ——  Pennsylvania Capital-Star is part of States Newsroom, a network of news bureaus supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

Law enforcement noticed the children appeared nervous and ultimately discovered the birth certificates were for other people.  Aguilar admitted the minors were not relatives, but undocumented aliens, and expected to be paid $4,700 to smuggle the minors into the United States.

This is according to a study presented at the International Maternal Newborn Health Conference held in Cape Town last week. The research was also published in The New England Journal of Medicine.

However, the implications of this advice are yet to be fully understood, as current research presents a somewhat murky picture of marijuana’s impact on prenatal development.  In an attempt to shed light on this issue, a team of researchers embarked on a study to explore how the timing of cannabis exposure during pregnancy affects fetal development.  According to the findings, even marijuana use restricted to the first trimester of pregnancy resulted in a noteworthy decrease in birth weight – over 150 grams on average.

Around half of respondents born in 1981 and 1984 reported witnessing gun violence, while those who had been shot hovered around 7 percent.  As crime rates declined, subsequent birth cohorts faced less exposure to firearms.

She snapped a mirror selfie of herself in a bathroom, and she arched her back dramatically while wearing a lovely pale pink cardigan.  But under the sweater she had a breast pump running, and the tube could be seen running out from her shirt to the device on the bathroom counter.  The Age Of Adaline actress wasn't afraid to be silly with the photo, and she added dual spurts of milk emanating from her chest.  However, it wasn't just her recent pregnancy that kept her from the Met Gala, as she and Ryan were also traveling for business.

Kunal Sen believed his father would have adapted to the technological advancements to make low-budget films.    From ‘Mrigayaa’, ‘Calcutta 71’, ‘Kharij’, ‘Ek Din Pratidin’, to ‘Bhuvan Shome’, Sen, who gave birth to a new cinema movement in India, highlighted the middle-class lives in the city through most of his films.  However, as Anjan Dutt rightly pointed out, Sen’s films threw questions at the audience, actors and even himself. However, he never sought solutions.  Kolkata is celebrating the birth centenary of the master filmmaker. On Monday, an eight-day birth centenary celebration, titled ‘Sentenary’ kicked off at Gorky Sadan. Beginning Monday, (May 15), the celebrations which comprise exhibitions, talk shows and film screenings, will continue till May 22.  Madhabi Mukherjee, who stole our hearts forever with her performance in ‘Baishe Srabon’, Bangladesh filmmaker Tanvir Mokammel, Goutam Ghose, Mamata Shankar, Ashoke Viswanathan and Kunal were present at the inauguration at Gorky Sadan.  An exhibition of his photographs, posters, journals, books on and by Sen, letters and mementoes is on at Gorky Sadan for all film buffs from 3.30 pm to 5.30 pm, except May 17 and May 21.  The inauguration ceremony was followed by the screening of the documentary titled ‘With Mrinal Sen’ directed by Sanjay and Subrata Bhattacharya. For the next five days, his cult films like ‘Baishe Srabon’, ‘Matira Manisha’, ‘Oka Oori Katha’ and ‘Genesis’ would be screened along with adda sessions on the maestro.  “My father always made low-budget films. Today, technology has made huge advancements and I am sure, Bondhu (as he would call his father) would have adapted to this changing technology and made films within a restricted budget,” said Kunal, who has written a book, ‘Bondhu — My Father, My Friend?’ on the master filmmaker."

On Monday, the Canadian artist's Twitter and Instagram accounts had updated to display his birth name rather than his artistic name.  And the change is part of a wider plan to ""kill The Weeknd,"" Tesfaye told W Magazine in an interview published May 8.  ""I'm going through a cathartic path right now,"" he said.  🏜️ ? — Abel Tesfaye (@theweeknd) April 11, 2023  ""It's getting to a place and a time where I'm getting ready to close the Weeknd chapter. I'll still make music, maybe as Abel, maybe as The Weeknd. But I still want to kill The Weeknd. And I will. Eventually. I'm definitely trying to shed that skin and be reborn.""  And Tesfaye revealed that his upcoming album might well be The Weeknd's swansong.  ""The album I'm working on now is probably my last hurrah as The Weeknd,"" he told W Magazine.  ""This is something that I have to do. As The Weeknd, I've said everything I can say.""  In March, Guinness World Records (GWR) announced that the singer-songwriter is statistically the most popular musician on the planet.  The 33-year-old took two new Guinness World Record titles. He had the most monthly listeners on Spotify, with 111.4 million as of March 20, and also became the first artist to reach 100 million monthly listeners.  A surge in listens was fueled in part by the fact that a remix of ""Die for You,"" featuring Ariana Grande, went viral on TikTok, according to GWR.  The track went to number one on the Billboard Hot 100 -- The Weeknd's seventh time at the top spot. The original ""Die for You"" was released in 2016 on his album ""Starboy."""

Ashlee Wilson, 34, from Banksia Grove, in Perth's north-east, was home alone last week when she rang triple zero complaining of severe stomach pains.  Little did she know, she was pregnant with her daughter Marley-Rae, who was born just six minutes after paramedics arrived.  'I said to (the paramedic), ''No I'm not (pregnant)'', and she said, ''Yes you are'',' Ms Wilson told Sunrise.  Ms Wilson could be heard wailing in agony in audio of the phone call she made to emergency services.  'The pain is coming right now, ugh!' she was heard crying out.  'Oh my God! I'm just sitting on the toilet because it feels like something's trying to come out but there's nothing there and it hurts!'  There was no time to rush to the hospital once paramedics arrived and Ms Wilson ended up giving birth to little Marley-Rae in her living room.  'I was in complete denial, I did not want to believe (the paramedic) at all,' she said.  'I was scared about what was happening to my body at the time and I was just in big denial.'  The 34-year-old had gone to her doctor complaining of a bloating issue but was bizarrely told just to drink more water and eat peanuts.  'Visually it was really hard to see, a lot of my family have been going through photos and saying ''even there you don't look pregnant'',' she said.  Ms Wilson admitted that because she had no idea she was pregnant, she was 'kind of in party mode'.  Ashlee Wilson, 34, from Banksia Grove, in Perth's north-east, was home alone last week when she rang triple zero complaining of severe stomach pains  'Of course there were things I was doing that I shouldn't have been doing that now I look back and think, ''Oh my God I'm so sorry if anything happens to you because of that'',' she added.  Both Ms Wilson and Marley-Rae are doing well one week on, with the mother saying the birth of her little girl is one of the best things that has ever happened to her.  'Here I was thinking I wanted to be an interstate truck driver a week-and-a-half-ago, now I want to give her the world and take it over with her,' she said.  St John Ambulance paramedic Melissa Gardiner said she felt lucky she was called out to the house.  'I feel like I was literally made for meeting Ashlee and Marley-Rae helping her into the world,' she said.  'Everything that I've done in my career has pretty much I think led me to Saturday morning.'"
