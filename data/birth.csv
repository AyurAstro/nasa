These centres will offer training in various trades to help these individuals in becoming self-reliant. Additionally, “Sehat committees” will be formed for area-wise monitoring of drug abuse and to combat the issue.

At present, the number of adult cheetahs stands at 17 and cubs at 3  A cheetah cub born at Kuno National Park (KNP) about two months ago, died on Tuesday, May 23, 2023. The cub was part of a four-cub litter that was born to three-year-old female Jwala.  The latest fatality took the death toll of cheetahs in KNP to four in the last 2 months, including three adult cheetahs translocated to India in September 2022 and February 2023.  Forest officials said the cause of the cub’s death is yet to be ascertained. At present, the number of adult cheetahs stands at 17 and cubs at 3.  According to Wildlife Warden JS Chauhan, Jwala was found with her dead cub around 7 am on May 23. Video footage showed that three of her cubs walked with her while the fourth continued to lie on the ground. Chauhan added that the monitoring team took a close look and found that the cub had tried to raise its head.  “A team of veterinarians were rushed to the spot. But the cub died during the course of treatment. Prima facie it appears that the cub was in a weak health condition. It was the smallest, least active and most lethargic compared to the other three,” Chauhan said.  The official statement that followed stated: “The death of the cub should be perceived with the lens of ‘survival of the fittest’. In Africa, the survival rate of newborn cheetahs is very less. Experts estimate that only 10 per cent of cubs survive. This means that in a natural environment, only one of every 10 cubs born will survive. Compared with other cat species, the cheetah has the highest birth rates.”  According to officials, the cub was also found to have consumed less milk compared to the others and its survival had been a cause of increasing concern among officials.  In March, Namibian cheetah Sasha was reported dead following renal failure while on April 24, Uday died of cardiac failure. Earlier this month, a female cheetah, Daksha, was found dead by officials while mating with two male cheetahs on May 9.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kb3dudG9lYXJ0aC5vcmcuaW4vdmlkZW8vd2lsZGxpZmUtYW5kLWJpb2RpdmVyc2l0eS9wcm9qZWN0LWNoZWV0YWgtbm93LWN1Yi1kaWVzLWluLWt1bm8td2l0aGluLTItbW9udGhzLW9mLWJpcnRoLTg5NTUw0gGCAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRvd250b2VhcnRoLm9yZy5pbi92aWRlby93aWxkbGlmZS1iaW9kaXZlcnNpdHkvYW1wL3Byb2plY3QtY2hlZXRhaC1ub3ctY3ViLWRpZXMtaW4ta3Vuby13aXRoaW4tMi1tb250aHMtb2YtYmlydGgtODk1NTA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"birth","2017-10-03","Not Discerned","{""Hartford"", ""Connecticut"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-24T23:50:03","A wide-ranging bill that permits the sale of non-prescription drugs in vending machines, including emergency contraception, and allows pharmacists to prescribe hormonal birth control passed the House Wednesday with broad support.  The measure would enable greater access to over-the-counter medications by making them available in special temperature-controlled vending machines throughout the state. Drug packages in the machines cannot exceed a five-day supply, and machines must be registered with the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection.  “I don’t want to be accused of hiding the ball … there is an emergency contraceptive [allowed],” said Rep. Mike D’Agostino, D-Hamden. “One type that is approved as a non-prescription drug that, just like aspirin, someone can walk in right now today to a pharmacy, pull that emergency contraceptive out, buy it at a kiosk and walk out, no age restrictions. So just like these other … non-prescription drugs, [which] you can buy now at an automated kiosk, you could buy them in these vending machines.”  The medication in question is commonly known as Plan B One-Step, or the morning after pill, he said.  The proposal also lets pharmacists prescribe hormonal contraception. Pharmacists who are morally or ethically opposed to prescribing birth control must provide patients who request it with a list of the nearest pharmacies that may prescribe the drug.  Additionally, the bill requires pharmacists to give patients a list of pharmacies that dispense abortion pills if their own location does not have a supply on hand or if the pharmacist objects to providing it for moral or ethical reasons.  “In this state and even across the country, we can see there are areas where we don’t have access to health care for women. And having access to health care be a barrier to get oral contraception for women is a non-starter,” said Rep. Tracy Marra, R-Darien. “So I’m really happy to see that allowing pharmacists to prescribe oral contraception is in this bill.”  The measure also allows providers to certify a patient’s use of medical marijuana via a telehealth appointment and to offer follow-up care through telehealth, and it permits pharmacists to work with law enforcement officials, school board members, community health organizations and others to expand access to opioid antagonists such as Narcan by making them available in vending machines and needle exchange machines.  “I know a lot of members here have been concerned about what can we do to get Narcan, the opioid antagonist that treats opioid overdose, into the hands of the people who treat those suffering from opioid use disorder — first responders, schools, police departments, health care agencies,” D’Agostino said. “So there’s a provision in this bill that’ll allow pharmacists to partner with those types of agencies to make sure that Narcan is available. And the pharmacists have trained the people at those agencies on how to administer Narcan immediately. The pharmacist doesn’t have to be there to administer the Narcan.”  The proposal is the second significant bill greenlighted by the House recently dealing with reproductive rights. A measure passed last week by the chamber offers additional protections to abortion providers who face sanctions in other states for performing abortions.  The contraception bill cleared the House Wednesday by a vote of 125 to 21. It now heads to the Senate for final passage.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vY3RtaXJyb3Iub3JnLzIwMjMvMDUvMjQvY3QtaG91c2UtZXhwYW5kLWFjY2Vzcy1wbGFuLWItbmFyY2FuLWJpcnRoLWNvbnRyb2wv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Medical experts gave the warning in Umuahia during this year’s event to mark the war against Obstetric Fistula disease in women and girls.  The obstetricians advised pregnant women to only patronize government-recognized and well-equipped hospitals to deliver their babies.  Addressing pregnant women, Mrs Ndubusi Onyenaturuchi and Dr Bena-Angela Arisaobi, warned them to always seek medical advice from certified and qualified doctors, nurses and midwives to avoid the risks of developing Obstetric Fistula disease.  They also blamed the lack of antenatal care and the failure of pregnant women to access or keep antenatal appointments with their Doctors as other factors contributing to Obstetric complications.  The experts described Obstetric Fistula as one of the biggest medical problems facing women in developing countries like Nigeria, adding that women in rural areas where poverty and illiteracy rates are high, remain more at risk of developing it.  The medical problem, they said, develops during a prolonged or difficult labour, especially where the woman may not access a timely or high-quality medical treatment, noting that it can also happen when childbirth injuries are not managed properly.  “It is one of the most tragic childbirth injuries. It is a hole between the birth canal or bladder and rectum.  It is caused by prolonged or obstructed labour without access to timely, high-quality medical treatment.  “Patients can suffer smelly discharge, purse or blood when they go to the toilet,” Dr Arisaobi said.  She advised pregnant women to maintain their antenatal dates with qualified medical doctors and government equipped healthcare centres throughout their pregnancy period and to avoid the services of quack birth attendants.  Dr Arisaobi further advised any woman with symptoms of the disease to seek treatment in a specialist hospital and avoid self-medication, as doing so could worsen the problem.  The speakers commended the efforts of the federal and State governments and also commended various international bodies for sustaining the war against Obstetric Fistula.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHlwb3N0Lm5nLzIwMjMvMDUvMjQvZXhwZXJ0cy1ibGFtZS1xdWFjay1iaXJ0aC1hdHRlbmRhbnRzLXBvb3ItYW50ZW5hdGFsLWNhcmUtZm9yLW9ic3RldHJpYy1maXN0dWxhLWRpc2Vhc2Uv0gF9aHR0cHM6Ly9kYWlseXBvc3QubmcvMjAyMy8wNS8yNC9leHBlcnRzLWJsYW1lLXF1YWNrLWJpcnRoLWF0dGVuZGFudHMtcG9vci1hbnRlbmF0YWwtY2FyZS1mb3Itb2JzdGV0cmljLWZpc3R1bGEtZGlzZWFzZS8_YW1wPTE?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"birth","2023-07-10","Not Discerned","{""Northampton"", ""Northamptonshire"", ""UnitedKingdom""}","2023-05-24T10:25:40","The prenatal development stage is a significant one for both mother and baby. By the 8th week of pregnancy, the embryonic period leads into the fetal period. The fetus starts to develop more defining features and the main organs continue to form.  As the baby continues to grow and nears birth at around 40 weeks, opportunities to carry out prenatal screening become available. These tests can be non-invasive or invasive depending on what is being tested for. Many parents prefer to keep the prenatal and birthing process as natural as possible. Below we explore what this means and highlight the benefits for mother and baby.  What is non-invasive prenatal screening and what are the benefits?  Prenatal screening aims to identify any potential health complications for the mother or fetus during the pregnancy.The results can give parents more options around further testing and treatment.  Non-invasive testing is usually done with ultrasound scans and blood tests, which carry little to no risk for mother and baby. These can identify conditions such as spina bifida, sickle cell anaemia and hepatitis B.  A combination of non-invasive methods can also indicate whether a baby may have Down’s syndrome or other genetic conditions. This can’t be confirmed without diagnostic testing, which is more risky and invasive.  Diagnostic testing, including amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CSV), is invasive because cells from the placenta are extracted and analysed. This can increase the risk of a miscarriage and preterm birth. Some parents prefer to avoid any testing during the pregnancy.  What is a natural birth and what are the benefits?  A natural birth is one where the baby is delivered through the vagina without medical intervention or pain relief. This is in contrast to deliveries using c-section techniques or epidural administration.  Mothers that opt for a natural birth often find it a more wholesome and rewarding experience. The ability to move around and change positions may help to ease the process of labour. Recovery times can be faster where no intervention or medical assistance has been required, hopefully helping mother and baby to full health as soon as possible.  Natural births should be less risky, but complications can arise at any point during labour, whether it’s a natural or assisted birth. For example, asphyxia occurs when the baby doesn’t get enough oxygen to the brain before, during or after birth – potentially leading to brain damage and conditions such as cerebral palsy.  If a baby suffers life-changing injuries from the negligence of medical staff, parents are within their rights to file a brain injury claim against the healthcare organisation. This can result in compensation which can help to boost their quality of life as they grow older.  It’s ultimately the choice of the mother if they want screening to take place and the type of birth they want to experience. Whatever is best for the mother and baby should be prioritised.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzc2V4bWFnYXppbmUuY28udWsvMjAyMy8wNS90aGUtYmVuZWZpdHMtb2Ytbm9uLWludmFzaXZlLXByZW5hdGFsLXNjcmVlbmluZy1hbmQtbmF0dXJhbC1iaXJ0aC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The celebrated comedienne revealed that despite also being a musician herself, she is demotivated by the returns on investment in the music business and hence why she does not give it much of her attention.  Kansiime noted that musicians are hard workers who reap very little due to the failed systems and the failed implementation of the copyright law among other policies that would have enabled them to earn from their sweat.

"birth","2023-05-22","10:00:00","{""NewDelhi"", ""Delhi"", ""India""}","2023-05-25T06:06:13","Union Home Minister Amit Shah announced on Monday that the central government is planning to introduce a bill in Parliament to link birth and death records with electoral registers and the overall development process in India.  Read on to find out all the details about this new update.  Government Planning to Link Birth And Death Records With Electoral Registers  During the inauguration of the ‘Janganana Bhawan,’ the headquarters of the Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India, Shah emphasized the importance of the census in laying the foundation for future development plans. He highlighted the advantages of having precise and comprehensive digital census data, stating that it can facilitate targeted development for the most marginalized sections of society.  Shah proposed that the effective planning of development activities can be achieved by appropriately preserving birth and death certificate data. The proposed bill aims to automatically include the names of individuals in the electoral rolls when they turn 18, and to remove names from the voters’ list when a person passes away.  Government officials have stated that amending the Registration of Birth and Death Act 1969 will not only simplify the process of obtaining a driver’s license and passport but also enable individuals to access various government welfare programs and receive other benefits.  Need For Accurate and Accessible Data  Shah emphasized the need for accurate and accessible data to ensure proper planning of development works. He mentioned that in the past, the developmental process was carried out in a fragmented manner due to the lack of sufficient data. Shah cited examples of initiatives such as providing electricity, housing, clean drinking water, healthcare, and toilets to all households, which faced challenges due to the absence of accurate and accessible census data.  He acknowledged that the development process in the country has been demand-based and fragmented, leading to duplication and increased costs. By integrating birth and death records with electoral registers and the development process, Shah believes that better coordination and more efficient utilization of resources can be achieved.  The proposed bill, once introduced and passed in Parliament, aims to establish a stronger connection between demographic data, electoral processes, and development planning in India.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vdHJhay5pbi9zdG9yaWVzL2dvdnQtaXMtdHJ5aW5nLXRvLWxpbmstYmlydGgtZGVhdGgtaW5mb3JtYXRpb24tZGlyZWN0bHktd2l0aC12b3RlcnMtZGF0YWJhc2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"birth","2023-05-17","Not Discerned","{""Manchester"", ""NewHampshire"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-25T02:42:15","Pep Guardiola praised his Manchester City players for shrugging off their hangovers after clinching the Premier League title with a 1-1 draw at Brighton on Wednesday to stretch an unbeaten run to 25 matches. A point was also enough for the Seagulls to guarantee they will finish sixth in the table and secure a place in the Europa League next season. Phil Foden fired the English champions in front, but Brighton were well worthy of the point given to them by Julio Enciso's stunning long-range strike.  ""Only 48 hours before they drank all the alcohol in Manchester,"" said Guardiola. ""Today they showed why they are the champions.  ""We were humble and run a lot. That is why we are the champions for many years, these players showed something special.""  Guardiola heaped praise on Brighton boss Roberto De Zerbi pre-match, hailing the Italian as one of the most influential managers of the last 20 years.  The City coach showed his respect by restoring a number of star names to his side that missed Sunday's 1-0 win over Chelsea to toast a fourth league title in five years.  Advertisement  Erling Haaland returned among six changes and could have had a seventh hat-trick of the season inside half an hour.  The towering Norwegian headed over Foden's inviting cross on five minutes.  Haaland then had a poor touch to blame for not beating Jason Steele when clean through on goal.  At the third time of asking he took no chances as Haaland unselfishly squared with just Steele to beat for Foden to convert his 15th goal of the season.  Advertisement  But after a slow start, Brighton soon began to live up to Guardiola's billing as the champions were rocked back on their heels.  ""In every situation, even when the situation was difficult, we didn't lose our style,"" said De Zerbi.  Danny Welbeck's free-kick came crashing off the bar and Facundo Buonanotte should have done better with his finish after sauntering through the City defence.  Kaoru Mitoma also saw an equaliser ruled out for handball.  But there was no stopping Enciso's leveller when it did come as the Paraguayan picked up Levi Colwill's pass and smashed an effort into the top corner for his first goal at the Amex.  Brighton had the ball in the net for a third time in the first 45 minutes moments later only for Welbeck to be flagged offside from Mitoma's pass.  The second period was less filled with goalmouth action despite the electric pace of the game.  Haaland thought he finally had his 53rd goal of the season when he headed home Cole Palmer's cross 15 minutes from time.  But a VAR review caught out City's prolific number nine as he had pulled Colwill's shirt to create the space for a free header.  Tempers briefly flared on the touchline after that decision with Guardiola shown a yellow card by the referee.  There were also minor injury concerns for City ahead of the FA Cup and Champions League finals next month as Phil Foden, John Stones and Bernardo Silva were not moving freely as they were replaced in the second half.  ""We have to be careful for the players to arrive to the finals as best as possible,"" added Guardiola.  But it was all smiles at the end as Guardiola and De Zerbi shared a warm embrace of mutual admiration after the full-time whistle.

McGovern Medical School at UTHealth Houston is the only institution in Texas to receive the prestigious designation for both maternal-fetal medicine and neonatal health. Researchers will focus on decreasing preterm birth and improving maternal and neonatal outcomes.  “We are very proud to receive this new award, which highlights the superb effort of our previous principal investigator Dr. Suneet P. Chauhan, and our current chair Dr. Sean Blackwell,” said Hector Mendez-Figueroa, MD, associate professor in the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Sciences with McGovern Medical School and principal investigator of the NICHD MFMU award of more than $2 million over seven years. “Both have been instrumental in highlighting the value of research and the importance of incorporating it into clinical care as we use evidence-based medicine for the best outcomes for moms and their babies.”  Through the NICHD MFMU, researchers with UTHealth Houston were part of the ARRIVE trial, which evaluated the benefit of elective induction at 39 weeks among first-time moms. Mendez-Figueroa said the study findings showed a benefit to newborns when following this strategy. “We also recently collaborated in the ALPS trial, which demonstrated the benefit of antenatal corticosteroids administered after 34 weeks, a novel approach previously not implemented,” he said.  Currently, researchers are assessing the benefits of treating obstructive sleep apnea early in pregnancy in an attempt to decrease the risk of preeclampsia; and evaluating strategies to decrease the risk of preterm birth among twins by using vaginal progesterone or pessary.  “In the next few months as part of the network, we hope to initiate a research protocol evaluating the ideal timing for initiating treatment for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Additionally, we will assess the use of prophylactic antibiotics to decrease infectious morbidity for patients undergoing elective cesarean sections,” Mendez-Figueroa said.  UTHealth Houston has been a part of the NICHD NRN since 1998, and at the end of this seven-year grant cycle, researchers will have completed more than 30 years of continuous participation. Funding for this cycle totals more than $2 million.  “The neonatology team at McGovern Medical School has expertise in comparative effectiveness research to compare clinical practices to improve care,” said Matthew A. Rysavy, MD, PhD, assistant professor in the Department of Pediatrics in the Division of Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine, director of Neonatal Research, and co-principal investigator on the grant.  Through the NICHD NRN, UTHealth Houston researchers led by Jon Tyson, MD, MPH, have been part of landmark studies including therapy to reduce death and disability in babies born with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (birth asphyxia), which have saved countless lives around the world; studies comparing different strategies of respiratory support and oxygen therapy, which have reduced death and morbidity in extremely preterm babies; and development of resources describing the outcomes of extremely preterm babies, which are used by tens of thousands of people each year. Tyson is a professor of pediatrics, obstetrics, and internal medicine and the Michelle Bain Distinguished Professor in Medicine and Public Health with McGovern Medical School.  “This new award reflects positively on the efforts of Dr. Rysavy and the entire research team, along with the tremendous clinical program led by Dr. Amir Khan,” said Mary Aitken, MD, MPH, professor and chair in the Department of Pediatrics and Dan L Duncan Distinguished University Chair in Pediatrics with McGovern Medical School. “We are proud that the Department of Pediatrics at UTHealth Houston will continue its collaborative tradition to improve the health and outcomes of critically ill and preterm newborns.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnV0cGh5c2ljaWFucy5jb20vdXRoZWFsdGgtaG91c3Rvbi1yZWNlaXZlcy10d28tYXdhcmRzLWZvci1jb250aW51aW5nLXJlc2VhcmNoLWluLW5lb25hdGFsLWNhcmUtYW5kLXdvbWVucy1oZWFsdGjSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"birth","2023-05-24","Not Discerned","{""Bamberg"", ""Bavaria"", ""Germany""}","2023-05-24T15:19:32","BAMBERG, S.C. — Years before the Bamberg County Hospital closed in 2012, and the next-closest hospital in neighboring Barnwell shut its doors in 2016, those facilities had stopped delivering babies.  These days, there’s not even an ultrasound machine in this rural county 60 miles south of Columbia, much less an obstetrician. Pregnant women here are left with few options for care.  Federally qualified health centers offer prenatal services in nearby Fairfax and Barnwell, but only when a pregnancy is uncomplicated and only through about 34 weeks of gestation.  During the final weeks of pregnancy, women must transfer their care to the nearest obstetrician, often in Orangeburg, which can be 20 miles away or more, depending on where they live in Bamberg County. Some women travel farther to hospitals in Aiken or Beaufort, where health outcomes are better.  “Most of our women are driving an hour or more from their homes to an OB provider,” said Tracy Golden, a doula and senior program manager for the South Carolina Office of Rural Health.  Although the regional hospital in the city of Orangeburg delivers babies, the birth outcomes in the county are awful by any standard. In 2021, nearly 3% of all Black infants in Orangeburg County died before their 1st birthday.  Nationally, the average is about 1% for Black infants and less than 0.5% for white infants.  Meanwhile, Orangeburg County’s infant mortality rate for babies of all races is the highest in South Carolina, according to the latest data published by the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control.  By 2030, the federal government wants infant mortality to fall to 5 or fewer deaths per 1,000 live births. According to annual data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 16 states have already met or surpassed that goal, including Nevada, New York, and California. But none of those states are in the South, where infant mortality is by far the highest in the country, with Mississippi’s rate of 8.12 deaths per 1,000 live births ranking worst.  Even in those few Southern states where infant mortality rates are inching closer to the national average, the gap between death rates of Black and white babies is vast. In Florida and North Carolina, for example, the Black infant mortality rate is more than twice as high as it is for white babies. A new study published in JAMA found that over two decades Black people in the U.S. experienced more than 1.6 million excess deaths and 80 million years of life lost because of increased mortality risk relative to white Americans. The study also found that infants and older Black Americans bear the brunt of excess deaths and years lost.  That makes Black infant mortality in the South a complex regional crisis that should alarm everyone, not just future parents, said Georgina Dukes-Harris, senior director for social care at Unite Us, a national technology company focused on societal needs. Birth outcomes for mothers and infants are a leading indicator of population well-being and they run much deeper than health care: They reflect politics. They’re a direct product of generational poverty and racism. They reveal our priorities, Dukes-Harris said.  Often, babies die under circumstances that states, communities, and parents can help control, like making sure infants don’t suffocate in beds or in unsafe cribs, or extending health coverage so that young women can afford to see a doctor before they become pregnant. In many of these respects, the South is failing.  “This is something that has to change,” Dukes-Harris said.  ‘An Urgent Problem’ With No Easy Solution  Public health officials are still trying to parse the long-term impact of the covid-19 pandemic, but infant death rates in South Carolina were higher than the national average long before the health care landscape changed in 2020. And a report published by the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control in April shows the rate for non-Hispanic Black babies — who died at a rate nearly 2½ times that of non-Hispanic white infants in South Carolina in 2021 — is growing worse. The death rate among infants born to Black mothers in the state increased by nearly 40% from 2017 to 2021.  “That’s just not acceptable,” said Edward Simmer, director of the South Carolina health department. “It’s absolutely an urgent problem to me.”  It’s a problem, though, without an apparent solution. Multimillion-dollar programs to improve South Carolina’s numbers over the past decade have failed to move the needle. To make things more complicated, separate state agencies have reached different conclusions about the leading cause of infant death.  The state Department of Health and Human Services — which administers Medicaid, the health coverage program for low-income residents, and pays for more than half of all births in South Carolina — claims accidental deaths were the No. 1 reason babies covered by Medicaid died from 2016 to 2020, according to Medicaid spokesperson Jeff Leieritz.  But the state health department, where all infant death data is housed, reported birth defects as the top cause for the past several years. Accidental deaths ranked fifth among all causes in 2021, according to the 2021 health department report. All but one of those accidental infant deaths were attributed to suffocation or strangulation in bed.  Meanwhile, infant mortality is a topic that continues to get little, if any, attention, especially in the South.  A group called the South Carolina Birth Outcomes Initiative meets regularly to talk strategy, but this consortium of the state’s top doctors, nurses, health insurers, and hospital leaders can’t solve fundamental problems, like teaching parents safe sleep habits or connecting all pregnant women to basic prenatal care. According to the Medicaid agency, nearly half of Medicaid-enrolled babies who died before their 1st birthday in 2021 were born to mothers who received no prenatal care.  “There’s good work going on. It’s just in little patches. It’s just not spread out enough to change our overall numbers,” said Rick Foster, a retired physician and former chairman of one of the Birth Outcomes Initiative’s working groups.  Expanding Access to Maternal Care  South Carolina and several other states recently extended postpartum Medicaid coverage for women who give birth, which means their coverage remains in place for one year after delivery. Historically, Medicaid coverage was cut off 60 days after having a baby.  Some experts believe expanding Medicaid coverage to single, working adults who aren’t pregnant and don’t have children — something most Southern states have failed to do — would also help curtail infant deaths. A woman who is healthy when heading into pregnancy is more likely to give birth to a healthy baby because the health of the mother correlates to the health of the infant. But many women don’t qualify for Medicaid coverage until they become pregnant.  Even when they become pregnant and are newly eligible for Medicaid, it isn’t unusual for women in South Carolina to put off seeing a doctor until the third trimester, physicians told KFF Health News. These women can’t afford to take time off work, can’t find child care, or don’t have a car, among other reasons.  Telehealth could improve access if the state’s broadband network were better, said Simmer, the state health department director. The department could also invest in a fleet of mobile vans that provide prenatal care. Each costs just under $1 million, he said. Ultimately, South Carolina needs more doctors willing to practice in rural areas. Fourteen of its 46 counties lack a single OB-GYN, Simmer said.  “We don’t have providers where we need them,” he said. To that end, he added, the state might consider using student loan forgiveness programs as an incentive for new medical school graduates to practice in rural areas of the state, where obstetricians are scarce. Meanwhile, two programs aimed at improving infant mortality in South Carolina, which were backed by millions of dollars in public and private funding over the past decade, were unsuccessful in hitting the goal.  The Nurse-Family Partnership, for example, which pairs expectant South Carolina mothers with nurses for at-home visits, didn’t have a statistically significant effect on birth outcomes, according to an analysis of the multiyear project, published by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.  CenteringPregnancy, a separate program that offers small-group prenatal education to pregnant women, also failed to improve birth outcomes, said Amy Crockett, a maternal-fetal specialist in Greenville and one of the lead investigators for the state initiative.  Crockett said she recently returned about $300,000 in grant funding to the Duke Endowment, a nonprofit that funds health, faith, and education initiatives in the Carolinas, because the evidence to support ongoing CenteringPregnancy projects simply wasn’t there.  “It’s not the silver bullet we thought it would be,” Crockett said. “It’s time to move on.”  Birth outcomes experts agreed that racism and poverty lie at the heart of this difficult problem, which disproportionately threatens Black infants and mothers in the rural South. Research shows that white doctors are often prejudiced against Black patients and minimize their concerns and pain.  In South Carolina, the maternal mortality rate increased by nearly 10% from 2018 to 2019, according to the latest data, which found that the risk of pregnancy-related death for Black mothers was 67% higher than for white mothers. Upon review, the state health department determined 80% of those pregnancy-related deaths were preventable.  Disparities related to both infant and maternal deaths deserve urgent attention from both the federal and state governments, said Scott Sullivan, division chief of maternal-fetal medicine at Inova Health System in Northern Virginia. Hospitals also bear a huge responsibility as doctors and health care providers must learn how to fairly and adequately take care of Black women and children.  “The idea that we’re going to solve 400 years of racism in an hour’s worth of bias training is a cruel joke. Systems have to remodel their approach,” Sullivan said. “It’s going to take funding, and it’s going to take a sustained effort.”  This story comes to GPB through a reporting partnership with KFF Health News.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdwYi5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDIzLzA1LzI0L3N0cmlraW5nLWdhcC1iZXR3ZWVuLWRlYXRocy1vZi1ibGFjay1hbmQtd2hpdGUtYmFiaWVzLXBsYWd1ZXMtdGhlLXNvdXRo0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"birth","2023-05-24","Not Discerned","{""Central"", ""Louisiana"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-25T01:00:00","The following contains all of the spoilers for the series finale of The Flash, which aired May 24 on The CW.  The Flash‘s nine-season run may be over, but there will still be speedsters, plural, watching over Central City.  The DC comics-inspired expansion of the Flash Family was but one of the bigger moments from the Arrowverse series’ very final hour, which saw Barry & Co. square off against a legion of sinister speedsters, featured the birth of Barry and Iris’ first child, and brought back a dearly departed (if not duly mourned) Team Flash member.  All told, what did you think of The Flash‘s swan song? Review our list of the more noteworthy moments, then grade the finale (and the final season) below.  SINISTER SPEEDSTERS. ASSEMBLE! Image Credit: The CW Picking up where “A New World, Part 3” left off — with Eddie succumbing to the power of the blue crystal, “inside” of which he saw Godspeed, Zoom, Savitar and Reverse-Flash — “Part 4” opened with the quartet of past sinister speedsters convening at the Negative Speed Force version of the West home. Friendly, verbal fire was exchanged — lotsa clumsy, exposition-y smack-talking, plus Eobard winningly mocking Hunter Zolomon/Zoom for stealing his shtick as the “friend of Team Flash turned foe.” Eddie then appeared, eliciting taunts from his descendant Eobard for being “the dumbest branch on the family tree.” Until….  COBALT BLUE SUITS UP Image Credit: The CW screenshot Eddie presented the blue crystal the sinister speedsters before him, and transformed into a suited-up Cobalt Blue. The five-pack of foes were then united in a mission to use their combined might to kill The Flash once and for all, and in doing so change history.  TEAM FLASH VS. A LEGION Image Credit: The CW screenshot Just as Barry reappeared in the present to check in on an in-labor Iris at the hospital — as well as loop her in on Eddie being the NSF’s new avatar — Eddie Cobalt Blue materialized to taunt the man who stole his wife/life. When Bluey vowed to kill Barry and end his bloodline, and in doing so shut down the Speed Force and create a new timeline in which Eddie is the hero, Iris said those three little words: “Run, Barry. Run!” And Barry ran, taking the fight to an esplanade facing STAR Labs, where Chillblaine and Khione, The Flash, Nora/XS, Allegra/Wavelength and Cecile/Virtue squared off against, respectively, Zoom, Cobalt Blue, Savitar, Eobard and Godspeed….  'DELTA MANEUVERS, NOW!' Image Credit: The CW screenshot As Barry bellowed the words above, everyone split off for their individual, pretty randomly assigned fight cards. I mean, who wasn’t thrilled to see Godspeed throw down with his mortal enemy… Virtue? And Eobard, bless him, tried to give his clash with Allegra some gravitas by gloating that he will kill her while “wearing the face” of her mentor, Nash. [Groan] Anywho… Savitar shish kabob’d XS just as he did her Mom some years ago, but she managed to “vibe” through the wound, grab his talon and then use it to stab him in the back…. Virtue and her vaguely defined “blasts” made quick work of Godspeed and his clones…. Wavelength, upon arriving at STAR Labs to find Chester dead-ish at Eobard’s hand, let loose with a pulse that KO’d the man in the yellow suit…. And I’m not quite sure how Zoom was bested, in that tunnel.  CHESTER ALMOST DIES, BECOMES A C.H.U.N.K. Image Credit: The CW screenshot After taking out Eobard, Allegra raced to lifeless Chester’s side, bawling. Begging him to come to. And sure enough, lest you think the series finale would have any good-guy casualty, Chester popped back to life. He and Allegra then shared a kiss that, if my math is correct, lasted longer than all nine seasons of #WestAllen kisses combined. Afterward, Mark reported that Chester survived Eobard’s attack because, after his years-ago brush with black hole energy, he now is blessed with a “consciousness-honed, universally neutralized Kerr-anomaly.” Meaning, he now is a C.H.U.N.K. (which is a comic book nod).  JAY (BRIEFLY) SAVES THE DAY! Image Credit: The CW screenshot As for The Flash vs. Cobalt Blue — a brawl which wrecked poor Jitters one final, umpteenth time — Jay Garrick (played by John Wesley Shipp) showed up out of nowhere to suck the blue crystal power out of Cobalt, using a “trick I learned from my Earth-90 doppelgänger.” So Cobalt was down, but not out….  COBALT BLUE SUPERSPEEDS UP! Image Credit: The CW screenshot Cobalt had one last trick up his sleeve, remotely absorbing the superspeed of Savitar, Zoom, Reverse-Flash and Godspeed, all of which left each baddie’s body and floated through the sky into the new villain. After Cobalt left, Barry, Jay and Mark debated what to do next, since Eddie — a good guy, at heart — is now doomed to die, due to the OD of superspeed. Khione, a goddess, noted that she has the power to get Barry into the Negative Speed Force. But once there, what he will need to do is change Eddie’s point of view, if he is to avoid catastrophe and a full-on fracture of the timeline.  BARRY NEGOTIATES SPEED FORCE PEACE Image Credit: The CW screenshot Barry arrived at an NSF version of the loft, where Cobalt Blue kicked his ass six ways to Sunday, wrecking a lot of nice furniture along the way. Barry took the beating and didn’t fight back with might. Instead he used his words to convince Eddie that the two of them, as avatars of the two speed forces, can align with each other, end the cycle of killing and create a better world. Eddie agreed to the truce and shook Bar’s hand, while promising they won’t always “see eye to eye.” But even in such times, Barry suggested, they will work together to find a way.  AT LONG LAST, NORA IS BORN! Image Credit: The CW screenshot With the Speed Force truce negotiated and the threat neutralized, Barry was free to be at the hospital in time for Nora’s joyous birth — so many years in the making. (Get scoop on the filming of that scene in the exclusive video above.)  JOE SINGS US A TUNE.... Image Credit: The CW screenshot Later, we even got a “live” performance from original cast member and Tony Award winner Jesse L. Martin, who sang an original lullaby that he wrote a few years ago for an Arrowverse friend’s daughter. (Get details on Martin’s original song, “Little Gregory Girl” — and Candice Patton’s thoughts on the scene)  KHIONE ASCENDS... AND CAITLIN RETURNS! Image Credit: The CW screenshot With the Negative Speed Force neutralized, Khione’s current purpose on Earth (as “the natural order’s protector of all things”) was fulfilled, and as some cosmic version of Wells had reminded her earlier at the hospital, she must now ascend. But as Khione’s essence/soul/whatever ascended, she left behind the corporeal form that she (sorta kinda but not exactly?) had inhabited all these months. (Chester had a schmiencey explanation for it.) Whatever the case, welcome back, Dr. Caitlin Snow!  A PARTY... AND A PROPOSAL Image Credit: The CW screenshot At a loft celebration for baby Nora, Barry apologized to Caitlin for the harsh words they had exchanged shortly before she died… grown-up Nora played with her newborn self (which seems like playing with time-travel anomalies, but whatevs!)… and Joe clinked his glass before launching into a celebration of Cecile, after which he asked her to marry him. And while you may have cringed that she’d at some point in her reaction remark, “Finally!,” she did say it, and it was justified. (Who here forgot they were never actually married…?)  BARRY CREATES NEW SPEEDSTERS! Image Credit: The CW screenshot In the course of soothing a fussy newborn Nora with a version of his “impossible” story (that echoed the Flash pilot’s opening seconds), Barry spoke of how their family has been blessed with these “amazing gifts.” Bar recalled how his friend Oliver once said that that lightning “chose” Barry — but now, he is going to do the choosing!

They said such an act attracts huge penalties and improvement upon conviction.  While appearing on NBS SpotlightUG panel discussion on civil registration with a focus on birth and death registration, the Manager Legal Advisory Services at NIRA, Brenda Kezaabu Agaba said there is a penalty for failure to register death and birth.  ""There's a penalty for failure to register a death and falsifying information regarding death,"" she said, adding that the same applies for someone who fails to register for the birth certificate.  Death registration is the official recording of the events of the death of a citizen. Officials said it is very important to register a death, especially for the next of kin.  Agaba also warned the public against giving false information regarding the registration of death or birth, saying it can attract penalties.  ""The public should be aware that if you falsify information you are liable to a fine and up to six months imprisonment .So you don't need to be caught on the wrong side of the law .Those penalties exist,"" warned Agaba.  Arafha Akurut, the Senior Registration Officer at NIRA said for the death that has occurred in the community it also has three steps like that of birth registration . These include notification step, registration step and certification step.  A death certificate comes at a fee of Shs 5000 for nationals and $40 for non-nationals equivalent to Shs 148000 although these are not issued with a NIN. Refugees get these services free of charge if they prove their status.  Akurut noted that registration of death currently is demand driven, adding that as a country people have not yet embraced the exercise the way it is supposed to be.  ""Most of the deaths that we register are demand driven (those who want) to process letters of administration and that is when (one) comes to NIRA to process a death certificate and yet every event of death that occurs in this country should be captured. We capture this for the purposes of updating the register,"" she said.  Akurut asked the public to have these events (death and birth) notified within the prescribed time.

Jie Zheng is accused of misrepresenting the level of antenatal and/or perinatal care and expertise her Richmond “birthing house” would be giving the wife and child of claimant Peng Chen.  The Richmond News reported last year how Chen, who flew in from China with his wife in 2018 so their child could be born in Canada, filed a lawsuit on behalf of his infant son, Stephen.  Chen claimed his son was born at Richmond Hospital with complications and alleged that two doctors — Brenda Tan and Balbinder Gill — as well as Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH), were negligent in the provision of medical care to Stephen and his mother, Rang Heng.  He further alleged that Zheng — who operated or worked at ABC, a birthing house on Ash Street in Richmond — took advantage of the fact that he had “little or no knowledge of the health-care system in Canada” and that he was “particularly vulnerable” to the alleged misrepresentations from Zheng.  However, Zheng, who had not filed a response in the allotted time, recently applied to the BC Supreme Court asking for an opportunity to respond, claiming that she and her family were living in China when the lawsuit was filed in 2020.  Defendant claims mail was not being forwarded to her in China  While out of the country, Zheng claimed the four tenants renting her property were instructed to forward her mail, but had failed to do so.  It wasn’t until January of this year that a new tenant forwarded her correspondence with regard to the court proceedings.  Zheng further claims to have no knowledge of the aforementioned ABC business, had nothing to do with assisting Chinese citizens give birth in Canada and that the only service she offered was room and board and not any medical care.  Chen’s lawsuit makes references to complications at the time of his son’s birth, resulting in his child being in the intensive care unit for several days afterwards.  Chen, a resident of China, claims that, as a result of the doctors and hospital’s negligence, his son suffered brain damage, seizures, delayed growth and development, cerebral palsy and cognitive impairment.  All of the allegations in the lawsuit are denied by the parties involved.  So-called “birth tourism” refers to the legal, tried and trusted practice of expectant mothers arriving in Canada to purposely give birth here, due to children being born in Canada automatically receiving citizenship.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJpY2htb25kLW5ld3MuY29tL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvcmljaG1vbmQtYmlydGgtdG91cmlzbS1sYXdzdWl0LWRlZmVuZGFudC1kZW5pZXMtb2ZmZXJpbmctbWVkaWNhbC1jYXJlLTcwNDY4OTDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"birth","2023-05-24","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-24T08:03:37","Many people think that when you are born in the boundary of Uganda, you automatically become a citizen but this might not be the case according to the National Identification Registration Authority (NIRA).  Manager Legal Advisory Services at NIRA Brenda Kezaabu Agaba explained that all births that occur in the country regardless whether it is a citizen or a foreigner must be registered as long as the event took place within the boundary of Uganda.  ""Many people think that if you are born in Uganda, you automatically become a citizen but that is not what the law says. Our laws is different .We tittle it citizenship by birth but it is citizenship by descent,"" she said.  Agaba made the remarks while appearing on NBS SpotlightUG panel discussion on civil registration with a focus on birth and death registration.  According to the Constitution, a citizen must be born in Uganda or have one or both parents or grandparents a member of any of the indigenous communities existing and residing within the borders of the country by February 1926.  Although born outside Uganda, one can become a citizen if their parents or grandparents were at the time of that person's birth a citizen of Uganda by birth. But if a child of not more than five years of age is found in Uganda and his parents are unknown, that child is then presumed to be Ugandan.  This is just like any child under 18 years, who is born of non-Ugandan parents but is adopted by a Ugandan, becomes a citizen upon registration.  The only other alternative for one to assume Ugandan citizenship is through applying to authorities and getting naturalised.  Edwin Tukamuhebwa, the Manager Registration, and Operations, Field Support at NIRA highlighted the importance for the parents to register the birth of their child before he or she celebrates his or her first birthday.  This registration gives the child the first proof of legal identity. It is also at this point that the most accurate information is got, according to the officials.  ""Most people don't know the benefits of birth registration but they are quite many. The number of births that happen in the community that are registered is still low. If you register a child's birth early, they won't miss benefiting from a number of programmes. We have seen schools now asking for birth certificates and NINs of children,"" said Tukamuhebwa.  The Senior Registration Officer at NIRA, Arafha Akurut urged the public to register the events of birth at the most appropriate time as per the Constitution.  Birth registration has three steps including the notification step, registration step and certification step.  A birth certificate comes at a fee of Shs 5000 for nationals and $40 for non-nationals equivalent to Shs 148000, although these are not issued with a NIN. Refugees get these services free of charge if they prove their status.  NIRA started the birth and death certificates in 2016. The documents issued before then are valid legal documents according to the officials.  Around 1.4 million babies are born every year in Uganda; they have the right to be registered at birth, according to UNICEF data 2017.  The birth registration rates for children under 5 rose from 30% in 2011 to an estimated 69% at the end of 2016 and there was a big challenge to capture it.

There was a problem processing your submission. Please try again later.  However, the automated registration system has managed to solve this problem.  The Mobile Vital Record System (Mobile VRS) captures and transmits a child's information by mobile phone from the community and by a web-based application from hospitals.  It is then uploaded directly into a central government server in real time.  This information is accessible to the respective registration officers of a given registration area, who verify it for completeness and consistency, before a birth notification is printed, signed and issued to the registered child.  Mobile VRS is ensuring that children are not left without an official identity and legal protection.

"birth","2023-05-31","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-24T09:52:49","A higher proportion of kids under age three in Massachusetts receive early support services relative to other states, according to a new report about early childhood special education services from a national research institute.  About 10% of kids in Massachusetts from birth to age three received what's known as ""early intervention"" programming in the 2020-2021 school year, compared with the national average of 3%, according to a new study out Wednesday from the National Institute for Early Education Research.  Massachusetts is one of just six states that provides services to more than 5% of infants and toddlers. Depending on a child's disability, these services can include speech and language training to services focused on developing social skills.  The report's authors believe Massachusetts provides a higher rate of support for this age range due to broad qualification factors. An infant up to age three need only be considered ""at risk"" for a developmental delay, which could include not reaching ""age appropriate"" milestones in language, social skills or motor skills.  However, most states only offer these early interventions services to kids who have a medical diagnosis or have more concrete risk factors like low birth weight or premature birth.  The study's authors noted in a media briefing Tuesday that it's hard to track exactly how great the need for such services is because each state defines risk factors and qualifying conditions differently. There are also varying levels of access to health care among kids that young.  Tiffany Gundler, of North Adams, was born with severe bilateral hearing loss. Speaking at the briefing, she said early intervention helped to ensure she didn't experience significant development delays from language deprivation.  ""The [early intervention] program not only helped me develop but it also helped educate my parents and my brother on the best way to communicate with me and live with my disability,"" Gundler said. ""I really believe it set me and my family up for a successful life.""  Gundler now works as a design and development engineer at a knee and hip replacement manufacturer.  The NIEER report also showed that, nationally, fewer kids under age 5 enrolled in special education programs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Such programs saw a roughly 15% drop in enrollment during the 2020-2021 school year.  The report said it's hard to pinpoint exactly what led to the decrease, but it was likely due to a number of factors including child health concerns, teacher shortages and challenges related to public health guidance such as social distancing.  There were also differences in the decrease in enrollment across racial groups. There was a 23% decrease in special education participation among Black 3- and 4-year-olds compared to an 18% drop among white 3- to 4-year-olds and 3% drop among and Latino and Asian kids of the same age.  ""The pandemic made the differential access by race worse,"" said Steven Barnett, senior co-director and founder of the National Institute for Early Education Research. ""And it's important that that not be normalized going forward.""  To address some of the variations by location and race, the report authors recommend that the federal government increase the amount of base funding provided to states for special education services in early childhood. The organization is also pushing for the formation of a national consortium of early childhood special education providers.  ""If the states could come together and share their solutions, we could find a way forward,"" Barnett said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndidXIub3JnL25ld3MvMjAyMy8wNS8yNC9yZXBvcnQtbWFzc2FjaHVzZXR0cy1zcGVjaWFsLWVkdWNhdGlvbi1zZXJ2aWNlc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

On that day, the world will stand still for the installation of the kingmaker as king. Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu will be sworn-in as the 16th president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the most populous black nation in the world.  Millions of Nigerians who believe in what Tinubu stands for are already jubilating across the length and breadth of the country clinking glasses of wine and rolling out the drums in special attires specially manufactured for the ceremonies where, according to the organizers of the event, over 200 presidents, heads of state and government functionaries will be in attendance.  Suffice to say here that the new Sheriff in town passed through the valley of the shadow of death on his journey to the Aso Rock Villa. His road to the presidency was rough and laced with thorns, pebbles and landmines. Even, some of the ‘boys’ he turned into men and empowered, betrayed him.  During the build up to the primary of the All Progressives Congress, APC, and the election proper, landmines were erected on his way by the so-called cabal or better still, conspirators within his party. But the man did not look back as he continued to put his hands on the plough. He didn’t lose focus for a second; rather he kept his eyes on the ball.  He held on to the popular saying: “No one who puts his hand to the plough and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God.” Not also fit for a seat in Nigeria’s house of power.  Some of his party’s bigwigs, including serving ministers went underground to support rival party, yet the man with a date with destiny surmounted all the banana peels.  As if that was not enough, some opposition parties mounted propaganda machine with the loudest voice to destroy his personality with all manners of fake news and frivolous cases filed against him in court to truncate his ambition, but this maverick politician and great builder of men and women didn’t blink an eye..  But, this is the time to move on and support this political enigma of our time who through his dexterity turned Lagos to an enviable position in Nigeria and beyond. It’s time to allow this man with his magic wand to put the country on the right trajectory for the benefit of all because expectations are so mountainous, especially with the beautifully crafted Renewed Hope ideology, envisioned by the grand master himself.  Tinubu is a destiny child, specially spewed out from the brightest side of hope and optimism at this critical time in the history of Nigeria to be the turnaround manager. According to Works Minister, Babatunde Raji Fashola, SAN, Tinubu is on a mission to liberate Nigeria from the iron grip of oppressors. Fashola in an interview, recently, said that Tinubu is like Manchester City’s Pep Guardiola, the best manager in modern football coaching. Fashola said that Tinubu knows his players too well. He gives his players all the football tactics but will always parade the touchlines to ensure there will be no mistakes.  In other words, Tinubu entrusts his team with assignments and still supervises the execution, unlike some leaders who give their team instructions and go to sleep. Not Tinubu!  President Muhammadu Buhari also has sweet words as tribute to his successor while giving testimony to Asiwaju Tinubu’s forthrightness, diligence and doggedness. Buhari said it was the same qualities that endeared him to the electorate and gave him all-round success as a private sector worker, a businessman and two-term governor of Lagos State.  Buhari said: “As one of the pillars of the APC, I commend the visionary leadership style of the Asiwaju of Lagos, who is also the Jagaban of the Borgu Kingdom in Niger State, for creating a formidable opposition party in Nigeria that worked vigorously within a short period to oust a party that had been in power for 16 years.  “Tinubu’s patriotism and commitment to democracy and good governance, and his generous spirit will always be remembered and appreciated by generations of Nigerians.  “I pray that the Almighty God will grant the Asiwaju long life, good health, wisdom and prosperity as he steadfastly supports efforts to promote the development of Nigeria.”  In addition, this is the first time Nigeria will have a leading light of democratic struggles as the president of this country. Tinubu is a democrat par excellence and a staunch believer in the rule of law – an apostle of progressive politics and sound advocate of government of inclusion. He believes in wealth creation through entrepreneurship.  No need consulting the crystal ball to know that this chess master in charge of the affairs of this country will lower the temperature of insurgency through appropriate policy of inclusion and drive excellence with multi-dimensional strategies by making our youths to embrace skills acquisition to become business owners rather than job seekers. That’s where the National Orientation Agency comes in to arrest the social drift of youths to Europe in the name of ‘Japa syndrome. As Tinubu is being handed the presidential mantle, let’s rejoice and celebrate the birth of a new nation, full of renewed hope.  Otunba Olatunji, an APC stalwart writes from Lagos.

Six different contraceptives, including IUDs (intrauterine devices), hormone injections and the morning-after pill, were first made freely available at the beginning of April.  ""April 1 was a weekend and when we returned on Monday, there were 350 telephone calls and requests from physicians for referrals for IUD insertion. So it was a big jump for us,"" Dr. Renee Hall, medical co-director of Willow Clinic in Vancouver, told CTV's Your Morning on Wednesday.  Hall says the surge in demand means backlogs of up to two months for an IUD appointment. Willow Clinic also inserts contraceptive implants like Nexplanon and provides medicated abortions.  ""When you've chosen birth control, that is the method that fits your lifestyle and you're not able to get it, you're using something that isn't ideal for you,"" Hall said. ""So your risk for unintended pregnancy is higher during that period of time, which is why we've always tried to keep the waitlist down below two weeks.""  With a decrease in the number of physicians inserting IUDs also adding to wait times, Hall said a remuneration fee could incentivize more physicians and clinics to provide the service. Additional government support could also help, she said.  ""Some of our specialty clinics (that) insert IUDs all day long, need to have some government subsidy. It's very expensive,"" Hall said.  Birth control care is a specialized practice within medicine, meaning not all clinics provide related services.  ""It's not something that everyone wants to do, just like maternity care, there's always going to be a group who loves doing it,"" Hall said, warning that backlogs won’t disappear without changes.  ""Until there are some changes with regard to the way that IUDs are remunerated or these specialty clinics are subsidized, it's going to continue,"" she said. ""There isn't an end in sight.""

A discussion will also be held there with the VC in the chair.  Kazi Nazrul Islam was born on the 11th Joishtha in Bengali calendar year 1306 in Churulia, near Asansol in the Burdwan district of West Bengal.  He was famous for his fiery poem Bidrohi (The Rebel) and his many melodious songs. He was a poet, lyricist, musician, revolutionary and philosopher.  The nation got inspirations from Nazrul’s poems and songs during the great Liberation War and all democratic movements and struggles.  There are 2,400 Nazrul songs, and together, they are known as Nazrul-Geeti or Nazrul Sangeet. He composed the songs, which he liked to tune himself.  Considering his impressive talent, Rabindranath Tagore dubbed him as Saraswati’s bor-putra (the gifted son of the Goddess of learning).  Kazi Nazrul Islam was the poet of rebellion against injustice and taboos. His nickname was Dhukhu Miah (Mr Sorrow). True to his name, Nazrul suffered a lot in his life.  His father died in 1910 while he was still at school and he became the breadwinner of the family working for a bakery company, Wahid’s, the most well known in north Bengal at that time.  Later, he resumed studies at Darirampur, Trishal, Mymensingh. But he left his studies to join the British Indian Army as a non-commissioned officer and was posted to Karachi. He left the army and settled in Kolkata, where he started publishing a fortnightly, Dhumketu (The Comet).  The magazine had a fiery tone and was critical of the British rule in India. He soon found himself in prison for publishing a poem written by him, ‘Anandomoir Agomone’ (Advent of Goddess Durga-the Goddess of destruction of all evil).  In prison, he did not stop writing. He wrote, ‘Rajbandir Jabanbandi’ (Deposition of a political prisoner).  After a prolonged hunger strike, Nazrul was released from the prison. But throughout the 1920s, he found most of his work banned. After the death of his second son – Kazi Bulbul – the poet was sad. He wrote, ‘My nightingale sleeps forever’.  Although known for his rabid criticism of imperialism, social and religious taboos, Nazrul also explored the themes of love, romance and devotion.  He also introduced a robust style that was very bold and innovative. His use of Persian and Arabic words in Bengali poetry also opened up new literary horizons. In the 1930s, the leading gramophone company of India, HMV, as a lyricist, employed him full-time.  Later, All-India Broadcasting Authority employed him. But his luck once again ran out and in 1942, he developed a rare neurological disorder that led to the loss of his voice and memory. Doctors in Vienna diagnosed it as Pick’s disease.  After independence, Nazrul was declared the national poet and he was brought to Dhaka from Kolkata by Bangladesh’s founding president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and given a house at Dhanmondi. He died in 1976 and was buried beside the central mosque of Dhaka University.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld2FnZWJkLm5ldC9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjQ3MC9rYXppLW5henJ1bC0xMjR0aC1iaXJ0aC1hbm5pdi10b2RhedIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

They told reporters that the recently-appointed secretaries of village and neighbourhood chairmen asked them Rs300 each for those certificates against the official rate of Rs100.  The applicants said local body secretaries received 60-90 applications for death, birth and marriage certificates daily but they didn’t maintain any record of the excess amount collected from them.  They added that only Rs100 was deposited for a certificate in the account of the local government department.  Village and neighbourhood council chairmen Haji Sher Afridi, Haji Khan Shinwari and Yad Wazir confirmed the assertion and insisted that relevant officials were also involved in the irregularity.  They said the elected council chairman had no legal authority to stop their secretaries from the unlawful practice or seek details of the collected amount.  The council chairmen said under the rules of business, the heads and secretaries of local bodies were supposed to open joint bank accounts for depositing collected amounts, but the newly-appointed council secretaries didn’t do so.  They claimed that money could be withdrawn from those bank accounts only after the formal consent of account holders.  A village and neighbourhood council secretary told Dawn that the people were charged Rs300 for urgent death, birth and marriage certificates each.  He said that out of the Rs150 charged for any certificate, Rs75 was deposited in the Nadra account under the rules, part of it in the local government’s account and the rest for daily expenditure of their offices.  Officials of the local government department at Khyber House promised an investigation into the matter and said that if any irregularity was detected, punitive action would be taken against the culpable people.

The Significance of Birth Time  In the realm of astrology, the precise time of your birth holds great significance, as it plays a pivotal role in shaping your astrological profile. Understanding the impact of birth time allows for a more nuanced interpretation of your zodiac sign and offers valuable insights into various aspects of your life.  Zodiac Sign Determination  Your birth time determines your zodiac sign, which reflects your core identity and character traits. The zodiac is divided into twelve distinct signs, each associated with specific qualities and symbolized by a constellation.

Frank Lloyd, from Ellesmere Port, was whisked off for tests after the medic noticed he wasn't breathing as he should have been. He had appeared healthy when he was born at Arrowe Park Hospital on January 28 but then the doctor flagged up concerns for the tot.  And tests revealed Frank had been born with a genetic condition called Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Type One, which makes the muscles weaker causing movement problems. Frank's parents Frazer Lloyd and Leah Statham have had their ""ups and downs"" since their son's diagnosis, according to family friend Joe Fearnyough, but Frank has been an ""inspiration to everyone"", reports the Liverpool Echo.

(Image: Joe Fearnyough)  ""They got lucky really, when they had the baby he looked fine and when you see him you would not think he has anything wrong with him. A doctor came in to check on him and noticed straight away that his breathing was not right. If that doctor had not come in, baby Frank would not be here now.""  Frank has SMA Type One which develops in babies less than six months old and is the most severe type. It is a genetic condition that makes the muscles weaker and causes problems with movement.  In the past, babies with type one rarely survived beyond the first few years of life. But in recent years outcomes have improved with early diagnosis and treatment. However, it is one of the most expensive treatments on the NHS.  (Image: Joe Fearnyough)  Joe, from Ellesmere Port, said: ""Frank is so inspirational and is honestly the most amazing boy that I have ever met in my life. Nothing gets in his way and he just deals with everything that has happened to him.  ""Doctors said he might never be able to move his arms and now he can, they said he won't be able to talk and he already has a little voice. He inspires me and I wanted to do something for him.""

"birth","2023-05-10","Not Discerned","{""Washington"", ""DistrictOfColumbia"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-24T15:53:17","For the first time in 16 years, the Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute (NZCBI) in Washington, D.C., is celebrating the birth of three meerkats. Keepers in the Small Mammal House reported for duty the morning of May 10 and observed that 5-year-old Sadie had given birth overnight. NZCBI had received a recommendation from the Association of Zoos and Aquariums’ Species Survival Plan (SSP) to breed Sadie and the pups’ 6-year-old father Frankie. These pups are the first offspring for Sadie; Frankie sired offspring previously at his former zoo. Meerkats live in groups called mobs that can include as many as 30 individuals, although the average mob size is around 10 to 15 individuals. Visitors can view NZCBI’s meerkat mob—which also includes Sadie’s sister, Stella—at the Small Mammal House.  In the wild, meerkat pups typically remain in an underground burrow for about three weeks. To encourage the meerkats to exhibit their natural burrowing behavior, a system of tubing—concealed within rockwork—runs along the outskirts of their habitat in the Small Mammal House. At the end of the tunnel, a nest box offers visitors a view of the meerkats’ underground sleeping chamber. The day Sadie gave birth, she surprised keepers by bringing her pups into the main exhibit space.  Animal care staff are leaving the mob to bond with and care for the pups without interference. They are closely monitoring the family and have observed Sadie nursing her offspring, which appear to be healthy and strong. Because keepers and veterinarians are not handling the pups, it may be some time before they can determine their sexes. Now 14 days old, the pups are starting to open their eyes and explore their habitat.  The SSP scientists determine which animals to breed by considering their genetic makeup, health and temperament, among other factors. Sisters Sadie and Stella came from the Brevard Zoo in Florida, and Frankie came from the Los Angeles Zoo in California. All three arrived at NZCBI in November 2022. Keepers describe all three meerkats as sociable, energetic and inquisitive. Frankie is laid-back and will take food gently from keepers’ hands. Sadie and Stella are quite bold and readily approach keepers. Initial “howdy” introductions among the three adults last winter went well, and they bred soon after meeting.  Native to southern Africa, meerkats live in the dry open plains, savannas and grasslands in Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and South Africa. Adults rotate sentinel duty throughout the day, looking out for predators. The International Union for Conservation of Nature considers meerkats as least concern.  # # #  SI-179-2023","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmVkdS9uZXdzZGVzay9yZWxlYXNlcy9tZWVya2F0cy1hcmUtYm9ybi1zbWl0aHNvbmlhbnMtbmF0aW9uYWwtem9vLWFuZC1jb25zZXJ2YXRpb24tYmlvbG9neS1pbnN0aXR1dGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

It is believed that the same biological mechanisms allow wounds to heal more rapidly than usual.  In the 2018 film 'Mard Ko Dard Nahi Hota', the protagonist Surya (played Abhimanyu Dassani) feels no pain due to a rare disorder named Congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP).  He suffers serious injuries, breaks several bones but doesn’t wince even for a second.  While the reel representation remains in the realm of fiction, a 75-year-old woman from the UK is the living embodiment of the rare condition.  Jo Cameron doesn't actually feel any pain in her body due to a rare genetic mutation.  Scientists have now uncovered how the rare condition allows her to live her life almost pain-free.

The new mother who once suffered a miscarriage has been on cloud nine since the onset of her pregnancy, and on Friday, May 19, she proudly announced the birth of her first child.  About ten days following childbirth, she tells the world about her baby’s physical features while keeping him a secret.  Jessie J Hints At Her Newborn Son’s Impressive Physical Features  The English songwriter has some exciting news about her newborn, and she took to her Instagram Story to share them, revealing the little one had already outgrown his clothes.  She shared a photo of several onesies flatly laid atop each other, including a red and white one with heart patterns and a black and white piece. Jessie then attached a note touching on her child’s speedy growth and needing new clothes less than ten days after she birthed him.  “Not even ten days old, and I am already doing a wardrobe clear out,” she wrote. “My boy came out LONG. I LOVE these, @fredandnoah.”  The 34-year-old added that although her son grew, his limbs developed faster, and he chose the day not to fit into any of his clothes. “His arms and legs and feet said NOT TODAY, Mum. Pass me Dad’s shoes – I’m going for a walk,” she jokingly concluded.  Fans may recall that over the weekend, “The Voice UK” judge spread the fantastic news of her son’s safe delivery one week after it happened. She wrote in an Instagram Story statement,  “A week ago, my whole life changed. My son entered this world, and my heart grew twice the size. The feeling is indescribable. I am flying in love.”  She added a few more words of endearment for the tot, calling him “magic” and “all my dreams come true.” The “Nobody’s Perfect” singer further expressed, “He is my whole [world]. He and I are both doing great. I am soaking up every second and still can’t believe he is real, here and mine. I am so grateful. Phew.”  She then rounded up with an appreciation for everyone who had been with her, loved, and supported her throughout her pregnancy journey. Jessie revealed her pregnancy to her followers for the first time in January with a heartwarming clip and noted conveying her happiness and terror to “finally” drop the news.  She pleaded with social media users to “please be gentle with” her before writing, “Honestly, ya girl just wants to ugly cry in public in a catsuit, eating a chocolate-covered pickle with no questions asked.”  Alongside the sweet message, she uploaded a video montage of her positive pregnancy test, images showing off her baby bump, and a video of her ultrasound appointment. In no time, she received so much support from many worldwide, including celebrity mothers like Kehlani and Gabrielle Union, who congratulated her.  In Kehlani’s words, “All that patience, you did it,” while Union exclaimed, “Yessssssss!!!! I’m so happy for youuuuuuu!” A remark from pop icon Katy Perry was also seen in the comments section, and it read, “I’m so happy for you, sending you all the momma love.”  The ‘Do It Like a Dude’ Singer Revealed Her Baby Daddy Prepared For Fatherhood By Reading  Several days before giving birth to a bouncing baby boy, Jessie flaunted how her baby daddy, Chanan Safir Colman, geared up for fatherhood.  As The Blast reported, she posted a picture of a book guide Colman seemed to have been reading, which was titled “THE EXPECTANT DAD SURVIVAL GUIDE. EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW.”  Reading up on details and guidelines about fatherhood was not the only way he showed support for his partner, as he was also captured being hands-on in an ensuing Story post.

"birth","2023-03-14","Not Discerned","{""MountainView"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-24T21:26:00","Advocates of stronger regulation of artificial intelligence have a long list of concerns and possible dangers backing up their argument, from short-term threats such as spreading believable misinformation to more existential far-off risks of superintelligent A.I. taking over humanity (or “going Terminator,” in Elon Musk’s words). A more medium-term fear is that A.I. will be one of the biggest job disrupters in recent history, with Goldman Sachs calculating in March the technology could soon replace the equivalent of 300 million jobs in the U.S. and Europe. But the peril of losing our jobs to A.I. could be undermined by another existential risk afflicting society, says former Google CEO and executive chairman Eric Schmidt: the developed world’s rapidly declining birth rate.  “Here are the facts. We are not having enough children, and we have not been having enough children for long enough that there is a demographic crisis where people who are my age are going to be taken care of by younger generations,” Schmidt said at the Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council Summit in London Wednesday.  Schmidt pushed back against the “narrative” that new technologies are inevitably going to cause disruption and lead to widespread job loss, saying that when it comes to A.I., the net benefit will likely be positive because of enhanced efficiency and the technology’s ability to replace professions that are already getting harder to fill in a shrinking labor market.  In the U.S., a historically tight labor market could become even tighter in the coming decades as a result of fewer children being born. Aside from a pandemic-induced “baby bump” in 2021, U.S. fertility rates—the number of children each woman would be expected to have in her lifetime—has been on a mostly steady decline since the mid-2000s, including a record-breaking 4% drop in 2020.  Couples’ concerns about their finances, crushing student loan and credit card debt, and a greater focus on career are some of the reasons Americans are having fewer kids (another is that in more developed countries, the birth rate seems to be lower just out of choice alone). Similar shifts are happening in developed economies in Europe and East Asia, but the trend might have serious economic consequences in the years ahead. With baby boomers retiring in higher numbers every year, the dearth of young people to replace an aging workforce could lead to a demographic and labor crisis within the next few decades.  “In aggregate, all the demographics say there’s going to be a shortage of humans for jobs. Literally too many jobs and not enough people for at least the next 30 years,” Schmidt said.  Countries have proposed a number of policies to stave off the worst effects of a demographic crisis. China recently announced sweeping measures and incentives to reverse its population decline, including enhancing maternal health care services, granting 30 days of paid marriage leave in some provinces, and even discouraging abortions. Many countries are also looking overseas for workers, such as Japan—historically opposed to mixing up its labor force with too many foreign staff—which has in recent years loosened its entry requirements.  In the U.S., the population grew last year after almost flatlining in 2021, largely because of increased immigration. Several business leaders—including Google and Alphabet’s current CEO, India-born Sundar Pichai—have long argued that the U.S. should welcome more migrants to fill out its labor ranks.  A.I. might also have a crucial part to play in the country’s labor force struggles, especially for jobs that workers were already walking away from during the early pandemic’s Great Resignation owing to burnout and unsafe working conditions. History shows that technology tends to automatically fill the gaps created by worker shortages. A 2021 MIT study found that aging accounted for 35% of the adoption of robots and automation in different countries. The authors also argued that fast-aging countries that also invested heavily in their robotics industries such as Germany, South Korea, and Japan were seeing better labor market outcomes than the U.S.  Companies started tapping A.I. and automation technology years ago for jobs like truck driving and bartending, professions that many workers willingly walked away from during the pandemic. However, the recent pace of A.I. growth threatens to be far more immediate and pervasive, as a March study by ChatGPT creator OpenAI found that 80% of U.S. workers could have at least 10% of their jobs impacted by A.I. The risk A.I. poses to jobs was one of the reasons OpenAI CEO Sam Altman urged Congress to regulate A.I. during his testimony earlier this month.  Schmidt argued that A.I. would eventually become a tool for efficiency in the workforce, but while it may end up as a net-positive for the labor force, job losses in the near term might be inevitable.  “What really happens is that people like yourselves, in the business community and so forth, you’re about efficiency. Ultimately there will be lots of job conflagration, right? Some jobs are created, some jobs are lost.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8yNC9hcnRpZmljaWFsLWludGVsbGlnZW5jZS1haS1lcmljLXNjaG1pZHQtZGVtb2dyYXBoaWMtY3Jpc2lzLWJhYmllcy1sYWJvci1zaG9ydGFnZS_SAXRodHRwczovL2ZvcnR1bmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMjQvYXJ0aWZpY2lhbC1pbnRlbGxpZ2VuY2UtYWktZXJpYy1zY2htaWR0LWRlbW9ncmFwaGljLWNyaXNpcy1iYWJpZXMtbGFib3Itc2hvcnRhZ2UvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"birth","1889-04-20","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-25T01:06:00","The house in Austria where Nazi leader Adolf Hitler was born will be converted into a human rights training center for police officers, Austria’s Interior Ministry announced Wednesday, according to CNN.  The building in the northwestern town of Braunau am Inn will accommodate the facility along with a police station, for which the Austrian government disclosed plans in 2019.  The decision was made based on the recommendations of an interdisciplinary expert commission concerned with depriving the property of its “mythical appeal to extremist circles,” the ministry said in a statement quoted by CNN.  The conversion – which will cost an estimated 20 million euros – is expected to be completed in 2025, with the police moving in the following year.  Hitler was born in an apartment in the building on April 20, 1889 and lived there until his family left when he was three years old.  The government took control of the building in December of 2016, after MPs approved an expropriation law specifically aimed at the property.  The move came after years of wrangling with the owner of the home, Gerlinde Pommer, who had been renting the house to the interior ministry since the 1970s and refused to sell it or carry out essential renovation works.  Pommer later campaigned to be compensated in full for the loss of her property. A court subsequently ordered the Austrian government to pay Pommer 1.5 million euros.  Hitler's birth home has attracted neo-Nazis and other extremists for years, with extremists making the trip to take a picture in front of the building. Glorifying the Nazi era is a crime in Austria.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlzcmFlbG5hdGlvbmFsbmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy8zNzE5MjDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"birth","2023-05-24","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-24T15:00:04","This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:  After birth, GLA activates RXR in the postnatal cardiomyocytes. This results in the activation of genetic programs that ensure that the cardiomyocyte mitochondria mature and use lipids as the energy source for the generation of ATP. This metabolic adaptation makes sure that the myocardium is provided with enough energy to sustain the heartbeat outside the womb, thus ensuring postnatal survival. Credit: CNIC  A study conducted in mice and led by researchers at the Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC) has revealed that maternal milk provides an essential signal that triggers the maturation of heart metabolism after birth, allowing the neonatal heart to function correctly and ensuring postnatal survival.  The study shows that the fatty acid gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), present in breast milk, binds to the retinoid X receptor (RXR) protein found in heart cells. RXR acts as a nutritional sensor of lipids and vitamin A derivatives, altering gene expression and influencing biological functions such as immunity, cell differentiation, and metabolism. Once activated by maternal GLA, RXR initiates genetic programs that equip mitochondria, the energy centers of the cell, with the enzymes and other proteins they need to to start consuming lipids, the primary source of energy in the mature heart.  The results, published May 24, 2023 in Nature, could have significant therapeutic implications for cardiovascular disorders involving mitochondrial and metabolic dysfunction, as well as diseases related to alterations in postnatal developmental processes, explained study leader Dr. Mercedes Ricote, who heads the Nuclear Receptor Signaling group at the CNIC.  In a mouse model, the research team found that the absence of RXR in the heart or the lack of GLA in maternal milk prevented mitochondria in the hearts of newborn mice from producing energy correctly, leading to severe heart failure and death 24 to 48 hours after birth.  The heart of a newborn mammal must quickly produce energy to sustain cardiac contraction outside of the womb. To achieve this, cardiomyocytes, the contracting cells of the myocardium (the cardiac muscle), need to activate their mitochondria to use lipids as the energy source for the generation of ATP (adenosine triphosphate—the essential energy currency of the cell). Although this process is crucial for the survival of the organism, until now, little was known about the signals that trigger the physiological adaptation of the heart after birth.  ""The need to maintain a constant and uninterrupted beat places an immense energy demand on the heart,"" explained Dr. Ricote. ""To meet their energy needs, cardiomyocytes maintain a tight control over the cellular pathways that produce energy. Any imbalance in these bioenergetic mechanisms can lead to the development of serious cardiovascular pathologies.""  For Dr. Ricote, part of the study's novelty ""lies in demonstrating that RXR plays a critical role in cardiac muscle, contrary to what was previously thought. This is an important conceptual advance in the field of nuclear receptors.""  According to first author Dr. Ana Paredes, the study presents a new framework for understanding the postnatal adaptations that occur in newborn mammals to meet the requirements of the extrauterine environment. ""Birth is a physiological challenge for the newborn,"" Dr. Paredes explained. ""With this study, we show that maternal milk, besides its nutritional function, plays a signaling role by instructing cardiomyocytes that they need to activate their metabolism because they are no longer supported by maternal physiology.""  In conclusion, the study shows that the fatty acid GLA, found in breast milk, is the key signal that ensures correct cardiac function after birth. GLA activates the cell protein RXR, which then directs coordinated gene expression changes to ensure that cardiomyocyte mitochondria mature so that they can produce energy in the extrauterine environment.  The results open the way to treatments to modulate RXR activity in cardiomyocytes with specific drugs, including some that already have approval from the US Federal Drug Administration for cancer treatments. ""Our study proposes RXR as a possible therapeutic target for neonatal heart disorders and systemic diseases triggered by metabolic errors,"" concluded Dr. Ricote.  The research involved multidisciplinary approaches and advanced sequencing techniques, including key contributions from the CNIC teams led by Dr. José Antonio Enríquez, Dr. Fátima Sánchez-Cabo, and Dr. Jesús Vázquez.

"birth","1972-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Faridpur"", ""Faridpur"", ""Bangladesh""}","2023-05-24T11:45:02","On 14th May we commemorated the birth centenary of film maker Mrinal Sen. Mrinal Sen was the last surviving member of the famed trio of Bengali directors, Ray-Sen-Ghatak (Ritwik Ghatak), seen as the founders of India’s ‘New Wave Cinema’. Sen, like Ghatak, may not have achieved the level of fame Ray did, but his work was equally admired the world over. Together they enriched the international reputation for the country which no other filmmakers had been able to.  Mrinal Sen was neither versatile like Satyajit Ray nor were his films painted with the pathos of our partition like the cinema of Ritwik Ghatak. Yet the maestro had his own benchmarks in comparison to his illustrious competitors. He devised a style of film making never seen before, making path breaking experiments.  A socialist by ideology, Mrinal Sen tapped into Bengal’s political psyche and created celluloid images of a reality in realms many would not dare to project.  The manner he dissected scenes, integrated characters or constructed dialogues had touches of genius.  In the manner of Bertolt Brecht, he made an audience detached, think for themselves, and not get swept away by emotion.  In a most subtle manner he manifested class antagonism and how social conditions shaped people’s lives.  In chronicling political dissent he hardly had an equal.  An avid reader of Karl Marx, Frederick Angeles, Rabindranath Tagore and Munshi Premchand, Mrinal Sen was always donned the qualities of a down-to-earth and affectionate person .  Mrinal Sen resented the authority of the Communist party or orthodox party structure.  Sen’s greatest attribute was his courage to question himself at the very root, which is a rare phenomenon amongst great artists.  Mrinal Sen was shaken to the ground with the collapse of USSR and East European countries, making him turn inwards.  Paying a tribute to Mrinal Sen on his birth centenary year, national award-winning director Kaushik Ganguly, in his next venture ‘Palan’, is recreating the characters of the master filmmaker’s critically acclaimed ‘Kharij’.  Background and Early Life  Born into a middle-class family from Faridpur (now in Bangladesh) in undivided India, he witnessed the freedom struggle and the communist movement from close quarters, and even courted arrest.  Sen upheld communist ideology throughout his life (according to him, he was a private Marxist). A Marxist, Mrinal Sen was closely associated with the Indian People’s Theatre Association (IPTA) between 1943-47, though never a member of the Communist Party. He made films that most vividly or lucidly illustrated Indian society – in diverse Indian languages. He made films in Bengali, Hindi, Oriya, and Telugu.  His interest in films was cultivated late and only after he began reading about them. According to an interview of his in the American film magazine Cineaste, occasionally he would get a few copies of foreign cinema journals where he first discovered the Italian neorealist movement. During this time, he did a variety of odd jobs. He worked at a print shop, became a medical representative, an instructor at a private institution, and an audio technician in a Calcutta film studio.  Film Career  It was not a smooth riding for Mrinal Sen in his film career. His directorial debut, Raat Bhor starring Uttam Kumar was rejected. Though Neel Akasher Niche and Baishe Sraban earned him popularity, he became an international legend with Bhuvan Some.  Goutam Ghose says that Mrinal Sen was compelled to write scripts for directors like Ajay Kar’s Kanch Kata Heera. He also wrote Jora Dighir Chowdhuryr Paribar to enable him to earn a decent living till he became famous with his Calcutta Trilogy and then there was no looking back for him.  His film Neel Akasher Neechey (1959) – set in the 1930s and exploring both anti-colonial nationalism and the class divide in Indian society – was the first film ever to be banned in independent India. The film shook India’s first Government because it illustrated the absolute apathy of India’s elites towards its poor and disadvantaged people, even though both inhabited the same soil. The ban was lifted after three months – but was an early sign of the Indian State’s intolerance to dissent.  Govind Nihalani was enamoured with the use of freeze and zoom shots in Mrinal Sen’s Akash Kusum.(1965) t is the story of the dreams of a middle class executive to gain greater stature and greater social acceptability. The young man attempting to secure a footing in the corporate world disguises himself till his deception turns disastrous for him, and ruins their relationship.  He made his first flash in Hindi cinema with Bhuvan Shome (1969).The legendary Uttpal Dutt portrayed the role of a westernized railway officer who unravels there is a life beyond the boundaries of bureaucracy during his duck hunting trip to Gujarat. Suhasini Mulay as a young tribal woman helps Dutt to untap the ordinary joys of life. The negativity of a feudal society that begins stagnating is brilliantly synthesised in Bhavan Some.  He brilliantly delved into the themes of 1970s India in many films. Sen’s Interview, Calcutta 71 (1971) and Padatik (1973) delved in exploring the social and political upheavals in the city during the turbulent naxalbari uprising, and are thematic portrayals of the politics of The Naxalite Movement. In a most subtle manner he illustrated the impact of the naxalite movement in shaping the lives of people  Interview (1971) follows a young man who is disqualified from a job because he lacks a suit to wear. A pathbreaking film. Although based on the colonial hangover, it reflected a wide range of issues like anti-establishment, middle class cowardice, and unemployment.  Calcutta 71 (1972) reveals the dehumanising aspects of deprivation and poverty on the one hand, and hypocrisy of affluence on the other, culminating with a young Naxalite being killed in cold blood by the police. It narrates the violence and corruption throughout the course of history. Scene dissection simply outstanding. A most lucid and illustrative study of the political turmoil of the seventies, documenting the agony of the common people taking intensity to heights rarely reached in Indian cinema. Here restlessness was captured at it’s absolute pitch.  The jump cuts of Calcutta 71 entangled with mime acting in certain scenes was a model in direction.  Padatik (1973) examined the contradictions or dichtonomy between middle class values and a young Naxalite revolutionary with the narrative conveyed with cinematic artistry in realms untouched. In ‘Padatik’ we witness the scenario of Kolkata as in the early 1970s; a place brimming with chaos.. Mrinal Sen portrays the burning issues within the scenario of political turmoil, with great sensitivity. The narrative follows a young political activist (Dhritiman Chatterjee) who escapes a prison van and takes shelter in a posh apartment owned by a sensitive young woman (Simi Garewal).Dialogues and scenes carved touching reality at the very rock bottom, with no element of melodrama, giving a viewer a great insight into the political scenario and how its shaped people’s lives.  Mrigayaa (1976) is set in the background of the Santhal rebellion and colonial rule which unfolded the double standards of the colonial state, which rewarded ‘hunting down’ revolutionaries and wild animals – but punished the killing of oppressors. Those features of the colonial state are ressurected by the Indian State today – and that is what makes the film relevant even in today’s India. Mrigaaya’ featured Mithun Chakraborty as a tribal man who is reputed to be one of the best hunters around, even by the British rulers. Yet t he was hanged after being found guilty of murdering the moneylender who kidnapped his wife. His trial and death later spark rebellion among the tribal people.  Ek Din Pratidin (1979) superbly manifests middle class patriarchy in India which circumscribes women’s autonomy even as it needs women to earn. This was reflected in a family’s response when their young daughter who is also the main breadwinner fails to return home one night – and then returns the next morning. It ridicules conventional morality.  Akaler Sandhane (1982), with untold mastery , captures how a film unit in a village is trying to capture the pulse of the Bengal famine of 1943 & finds no difference between then and now; or between reel life and real life, The film unravels s the convivial life among the film crew and the hurdles of filmmaking on location. It bridges the link between 1943 and 1980, in the manner of past meeting the present.  Khandhar (1984) written by Premendra Mitra, penetrates the flurry of emotions within the human mind when it is faced with a choice between the revolutionary and difficult, and the ordinary but comfortable. Subash (Naseeruddin Shah), an eager but not-so-well established photographer visits a cast-off village which is in ruins along with his two friends. On the first night of his venture, he notices a girl. The following day, he gets to know that the girl, Jamini (Shabana Azmi), continued to live in the ruins with her dying mother after the village was abandoned by the Zamindars due to a malaria epidemic many decades ago. Scene dissection and direction epitomising artistry at it’s very best.  Jamini represents a conventional Indian maiden on the surface, yet aspires for her circumstances to change. She is an insecure, dutiful daughter who sometimes expresses her indignation of being alone and betrayed by her mother but recognizes her ‘fault’ the very next moment and rapidly returns to abiding to the task of of a caring but mournful daughter. Subash gets drawn to this sensitive and civilized girl, which crystallises the theme. One is left in suspense if history will repeat itself for Subash and Jamini.  Mahaprithivi’ (1991) begins with the sequence of suicide of a mother one of whose sons, at the helm of the Naxalite movement two decades earlier, was shot dead by the police. It examines the reasons behind her taking this step and whether with communism collapsing in country after country, her son’s sacrifice would be dumped into the dustbin of history.  Mrinal Sen won awards at Cannes and also served as a jury member in the Mecca of film festivals. He termed Cannes his second home. During his lifetime he cherished recollected his interactions with Akira Kurasawa, Richard Attenborough and Jean Luc Goddard. He attributed how Goddard shaped his filmmaking style.  He won special jury prizes for Akaler Shandhaney (In Search of Famine, 1981) at Berlin and Kharij (The Case Is Closed, 1982) at Cannes.  Characteristics of Mrinal Sen’s films  First, he had the courage to make films which were staunchly political. His ‘Calcutta Trilogy’ and ‘Chorus’, for instance, were landmarks. Renowned critic Derek Malcolm wrote, “… but against tremendous odds, he has traced the social and political ferment of India with greater resilience and audacity than any other contemporary Indian director…”  Second, Sen refrained from being stereotyped. Two of his popular films — ‘Neel Akasher Niche’ (1958), and the influential ‘Bhuvan Shome’ pioneered the Indian new wave and Sen illustrated untold mastery over the narrative format. However, instead of continuing that way, he altered his conventional format through bolder films that followed.  Third, he not only explored the middle and lower-middle class realities but was brave enough to question himself too. He quoted physicist Niels Bohr: “Confidence comes from not being always right, but from not fearing to be wrong.” This attitude, of never afraid of making a mistake, sparkled his creativity and sustained his spirit.  Flaws  It is regretful that Mrinal Sen ventured into personalised films after being disillusioned with the fall of Communism, from the 1990’s. In later periods, he did not embark on the task of documenting films s confronting the anti-Communist propaganda or the tormentation of people with the advent of globalisation.

What can God do in your life with one Bible verse a day? Subscribe to Aleteia's new service and bring Scripture into your morning:  Just one verse each day. Click to bring God's word to your inbox  Pope Francis was in attendance for the recent “General States of Natality,” an Italian conference that seeks to address the ongoing crisis of low birth rates, often described as a “demographic winter.” The Pope noted a variety of social and economic factors that have contributed to the declining Italian birth rates, stating, “The family is not part of the problem, but is part of its solution.”  At a 2021 Angelus address, the Pontiff lamented that, in Italy, “It seems that many couples prefer not to have children or to have only one child.”  A report from CNN, however, is suggesting that the desire to have many children exists in Italian parents, but there are several hurdles that make it difficult.  Aleteia has previously reported on the dwindling birth rates of Italy:  According to The World Factbook, with only 1.24 births per woman, Italy has the worst fertility rate in Europe and the 6th worst globally. The 2023 birth rate in the country was 7 births per 1,000 people, and Italian women tend to have children on average at around 31 years old. There were 392,598 births in 2022, 7,651 fewer than in 2021 (-1.9%).  The Italian birth rate has been consistently falling since the 2008 economic crisis and the continuing trend is largely being blamed on the economic instability that persists in a large portion of the population. CNN took a look at the economy in relation to the falling birth rates to explain the fall of Italian fertility.  Examining monthly income of prospective parents, CNN found that the average monthly earnings in Italy stands at €2,475 a month, according to figures from ISTAT. With the average cost of a 100-square-meter (1,000-square-foot) apartment being €1,212, the report quickly identified the housing market as a prime factor of financial struggles. Prospective parents who are spending half their monthly pay just to keep a roof over their heads may take pause when considering adding another member to the family.  Monthly savings were also found to have fallen drastically since the 2020 pandemic. Whereas Italy was once considered a nation of “savers,” with the average family putting aside 20% of their monthly income, now this figure has fallen to just over 5% as of 2023. The report notes that the Italian government offers incentives for parents to have more children, including a monthly grant of €175 per child, but CNN pointed towards similar tactics that have not borne fruit in Germany or France.  CNN spoke with a young married couple – Claudia Giagheddu Saitta, 27, and Gabriele De Luca, 31 – who have been hesitant to start their family in the current economic climate. Claudia said that monthly grants and tax cuts on baby products are not enough to put them at ease:  “The government thinks €10,000 ($10,800) is enough to have a child. But the incentives are temporary. A child lasts forever,” Giagheddu Saitta says. She says the idea of having more than one child, if she has one at all, feels impossible.  De Luca went on to blame the government for not doing enough to support an incoming younger generation. He said that the government was voted in by those in their 50s to 70s, who place their own interests before those of the next generation. Furthermore, he suggested that Italy may need to take some risks in displeasing this voter base if it wishes to spur a baby boom.  While the largest voter base in Italy continues to be those at or approaching retirement age, the lackluster fertility rates should be of concern to them as well. Italy’s pension system is described as “pay-as-you-go,” in which the current workforce pays into the pension program to support those who have retired. This fund, however, is placed in jeopardy by low levels of new workers entering the workforce. It is thought that by 2030, 2 million workers will have entered retirement with no new members of the workforce to pay their pensions.

As early as 2018, the British Reproduction and Embryology Authority (HFEA) approved the first in vitro fertilization trials using this technique. It is a process which, while not treating the disease from which the mother is suffering, is not without risk for the child either.  Mitochondria are micro-organelles present in almost all human cells and which generate most of a cell's energy. They are mainly provided by the oocyte during fertilization and are therefore essentially of maternal origin.  Sometimes mitochondria have genetic abnormalities that cause serious and incurable medical conditions. To prevent a mother whose mitochondria are failing from transmitting this anomaly to her child, the mother's mitochondria are replaced with mitochondria from a donor.  Until now, women with defective mitochondria could appeal for egg donation. With the donation of mitochondria, the embryos carry the DNA of the biological father, the DNA of the biological mother and the mitochondrial DNA of the donor (which represents approximately 37 genes).  To date, there is no guarantee that the child thus conceived is actually free from the disease of which its mother is a carrier. Interviewed by The Guardian, genetics professor Dagan Wells of the University of Oxford admits that, while clinical experiences of the mitochondrial transfer technique are encouraging, the number of cases remains too low to be sure of the safety and the effectiveness of the technique.  Mitochondria can indeed remain attached to the nucleus of the egg at the time of nuclear transfer, multiply or even take over compared to healthy mitochondria. This involves selecting in vitro the embryo that will have a rate of abnormal mitochondria of less than 10%, but also verifying the absence of a “turnaround” during pregnancy by means of prenatal tests.  This technique presents two moral transgressions at two different levels. The first is that of in vitro fertilization in general, which is reprehensible for many reasons: the immoral obtaining of male gametes in the first place, and second, all the consequences such as the multiple destruction of embryos which mark the history of this technique.  The second transgression is specific to this technique: from in vitro fertilization to prenatal testing, without forgetting embryonic selection, the technique of mitochondrial transfer is punctuated by manipulations that are currently still uncertain and which question ethics from the point of view of dignity, of the genetic heritage and the health of these children who are the subjects of experimentation.  There are now many works on epigenetics which have shown that the various manipulations that accompany and surround in vitro fertilization are responsible for various genetic diseases. The full list is still being compiled.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vZnNzcHgubmV3cy9lbi9uZXdzLWV2ZW50cy9uZXdzL3VuaXRlZC1raW5nZG9tLWJpcnRoLWJhYnktZG5hLXRocmVlLXBhcmVudHMtODI3NDXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Charleigh Chatterton, 27, of Harwich, gave birth to her daughter Alessia on April 22 with no initial complications.  Six days later, however, she was overcome with a huge rash across her abdomen which eventually developed into necrotising fasciitis, a flesh-eating disease with a mortality rate between 11 and 22 per cent.  Charleigh said: “We left the rash for a day as it looked normal at first but it got a lot worse on Sunday.  “My fiancé Liam called the midwives on Sunday and they recommended I went in to be checked.  “With multiple tests carried out in Colchester Hospital, I was getting clear results but my health was rapidly declining and I was struggling to remain conscious.  “They sent me down for a CT scan and very quickly after this I was given the news of a possible flesh eating bacteria, necrotising fasciitis, and I needed surgery immediately.”  Charleigh was rushed down on May 1 for an operation and she then had another surgery the next day.  She was kept sedated until Wednesday when doctors were able to wake her up but Charleigh still had two large open wounds on her abdomen.  As a result, a significant amount of dead tissue had to be removed to stop the continuously growing flesh-eating bacteria.  The wounds were left open until May 8 when she then had medical vacuum pumps fitted around her body.  Once they were fitted Charleigh had a further week of physiotherapy treatment before heading home.  Charleigh described how she was feeling during this potentially fatal ordeal.  She added: “I was so frightened, I didn’t think I’d ever be able to see my daughter.  “Liam’s biggest fear was losing me or my daughter and knowing that it was potentially going to be me made me feel quite guilty.  “I always told him that would never happen and receiving potentially fatal news made me feel guilty.”  Charleigh thanked doctors and nurses for being ‘fantastic’ with their treatment of her and keeping her comfortable.

"birth","2023-05-19","Not Discerned","{""Jiddah"", ""Mecca"", ""SaudiArabia""}","2023-05-24T14:28:00","In his opening remarks at the Arab League Summit in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on Friday, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman welcomed Arab leaders, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, and then Syrian President Bashar al-Assad who was readmitted into the organization after 12 years of estrangement.  While Russia’s client was readmitted into the ranks of the Arab League, Putin’s adversary was given a platform to make his case in front of the Arab world. Welcome to the new Middle East.  Syria’s return to the Arab League during the summit in Jeddah has been criticized as a Saudi-led push to “rehabilitate” Syrian President Bashar al Assad, the leader of a fractured Syria who oversaw the slaughter of half a million of his countrymen and the displacement of 11 million under Russian air cover and the guidance and tactical command of Iranian Revolutionary Guards commanders and militias on the ground.  Those critics fail to appreciate the reality of the order that is being born in the region, absent the sheltering American security umbrella that friends and foes had accepted as a fact of nature for the past half-century. Whether America’s leaders and the wise men of Davos are right or wrong to bet on the impending disappearance of fossil fuels as a strategic resource, the region has received the message loud and clear: Elvis has left the building.  Since countries can’t be moved as easily as oil tankers and warships, regional leaders are left with no choice but to try and build a modus vivendi -- even if that means eating dinner together with war criminals.  Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy during the Arab League summit, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, May 19, 2023. (credit: Ukrainian Presidential Press Service/Handout via REUTERS)  Through brute force, and the unwavering support of his patrons, Russia and China, Bashar al Assad has managed to prevail in his war against his own people, delivering a strategic victory to the Russia-Iran axis that will allow him to preside indefinitely over a tattered and fractured Syria.  Giving Syria a place at the table is a recognition of a reality that the Syrian dictator has forged out of steel and blood. It is also a victory for his patrons who facilitated his murderous behavior. It is reasonable to expect that future would-be Arab strongmen are paying close attention to these ugly lessons.  President Zelensky is also in Jeddah. The presence of a staunch Russian adversary and symbol of democracy in the Kingdom for the Arab League summit at the same time as Bashar al-Assad illustrates the other side of a new Middle East. While initiatives led by US allies focused in the past on maintaining the US security order, this Arab League summit brings together a region that can no longer be easily divided into well-marked camps policed by superpower patrons. The most notable feature of this new landscape is a competition for influence, power and resources that is open to all players.  While open competition is not in itself a bad thing, the prospect of a regional free-for-all carries considerable risks – both to American interests and to regional stability. Without clear alliances and rules, the threat of armed conflict can only increase.  Lack of US strategy leaves power vacuum  Meanwhile, the United States lacks a coherent strategy to manage its own remaining, quite large interests in the region. Even if the long-term American goal is simply to erase the region from the maps of US military and economic planners, departing in a haphazard and piecemeal way is a recipe for increasing chaos that will negatively impact American interests while damaging the region in ways with likely global effects, and not simply local.  Beijing has capitalized on the power vacuum left by the United States, most recently by brokering an agreement in Beijing between Riyadh and Tehran. The enmity between those two capitals is based mostly on Iran’s perception of Saudi Arabia being an agent of the American order in the Middle East.  Absent that order, why should there be enmity? While the Iranians have reneged on agreements many times in the past, Chinese guarantees introduced a new level of confidence for the Saudis. At the same time, the Chinese clearly lack the American ability to back up their commitments with force.  Saudi Arabia’s reestablishment of diplomatic ties with Syria does not mean the Kingdom condones the crimes committed in that country, any more than it is now aligning itself with either Teheran or with Beijing. Instead, Saudi Arabia realizes that absent a coherent US-backed security architecture in the region, senselessly making pariahs of regional actors – whoever they are – makes little strategic sense.  US allies are not pivoting away from America. Instead, they are pursuing their own national interests. Nothing illustrates the new realities of the Middle East better than the Saudi Kingdom hosting both Vladimir Zelensky and Bashar al-Assad in the same room in Jeddah. Both the opportunities and the dangers of a region that is being left to manage its own problems and rivalries, without superpower guarantees and guidance, could not be more clear.

Jade Mead, 35, credits her fitness regime - which included deep squats and side lunges - for helping her during a speedy labour.  The mum-of-two did the exercises throughout her last pregnancy in the hopes that the birth would be as quick and easy as possible.  And it turned out that her second labour happened so quickly she wasn't even able to make it to the hospital in time - her husband, Ryan, 40, a digital marketer, had to pull his car over and deliver her baby on the roadside.  Baby, Lottie, now four weeks old, came out in just four pushes in April 26, 2023 weighing 7lbs 2oz.  Mum and baby were taken to hospital to be checked over but are now home and healthy.  Jade, Ryan and Lottie Mead (Picture: SWNS)  Jade, a fitness coach from Perth, Australia, said: 'I had to give birth in the middle of a roadside.  'There were no lights, I had no pain relief, and I was screaming with every push.  'It all happened so quickly!'  Jade had experienced a similar situation with her first daughter, Mali, three.  Mali was born three weeks early - which meant Jade was unable to continue her birthing prep exercises to full-term.  On December 27, 2019, Jade gave birth to Mali in just five hours - and again she credits her fitness routine.  She said: 'I focused a lot on hip-opening exercises to prepare for each birth. A lot of them focused on yoga and stretching.  'So I was swearing by deep squats, child's pose, cat-cow pose, deep lunge stretches and side-lunge stretches.  'I also drank a lot of raspberry leaf tea, and did a lot of curb walking - where you walk with one foot on the curb, one foot in the road.'  She practiced the exact same regime in the last three weeks of her second pregnancy, after her midwife suggested her labour experiences would be similar.  Jade and Lottie (Picture: SWNS)  Jade's contractions began 'very slowly' so she thought her birth would be very different - which is why they didn't go straight to the hospital.  Jade said: 'Labour didn't progress for a very long time - until it did, and it all happened within the last hour!  'At 6:30pm, Ryan and I put Mali to bed and left her with my mum. We wanted to put her to bed and bath her ourselves just to know she was safe and sorted.  'But because we did that, we ended up leaving too late. At 7pm, we got in the car, and my entire body was shivering and shaking.  'Straight away, my contractions became really intense.'  She had no pain relief so was looking for things to distract herself with.  The birth happened so quickly, she knew she had to push even though the couple were still in the car.  Jade then went to hospital (Picture: SWNS)  Baby Lottie (Picture: SWNS)  Jade said: 'As [Ryan] felt around, I screamed and pushed - his hand flew out - and so did the baby's head.'  On the sideroad, Jade's midwife and the emergency service operator were trying to get her to stay calm, while Ryan had to deliver the baby.  She said: 'I had my eyes closed the whole time - I was in so much pain.  'After the first two big pushes - I decided to take my shorts off. Within two more pushes, Lottie came out at 7:28pm.  'It was such a blur. I was exhausted. The midwife told Ryan to pop her on my chest and rub her back. It was a miracle, she was crying and red-faced straight away. Just a really healthy baby.'  Ryan wrapped Jade and Lottie up in blankets while they waited for the paramedics to arrive.  She said: 'We're both doing completely fine now - both Lottie and Mali are happy and healthy.  'Ryan keeps joking to our friends that he fancies himself as a midwife now - he's got once-in-a-lifetime practical training!'  Do you have a story to share?

Eugenie's mother Sarah Ferguson recently told Samara García Mendez from ¡HOLA! TV about the new royal baby: ""Well, we don’t know what it is yet. But the baby is due by the end of May, I think. So it’s any minute now.""  The birth and first few months of Eugenie and Jack's second baby are set to be quite different from the arrival of little August back in 2021, and they are bound to be thrilled at the change.  WATCH: Princess Eugenie's son August dances around in adorable clip  August Brooksbank was born on 9 February 2021 at London's private Portland Hospital.  An announcement by Buckingham Palace at the time said: ""Her Royal Highness Princess Eugenie was safely delivered of a son today, 9th February 2021, at 0855hrs at The Portland Hospital. Jack Brooksbank was present. The baby weighs 8lbs 1oz.""

From 5 January 2021, the COVID Alert Level was at the highest level of five. Socialising was limited to people in your household or support bubble and the two-metre contact rule was back in place.  Schools were closed once again, as well as non-essential shops, and exercise outside your house was limited to once a day in the local area. People were allowed to exercise with one person outside their household. It was March before children returned to school and restrictions were lifted.  © Photo: Instagram Baby August with parents Eugenie and Jack  So while Eugenie, 33, welcomed baby August in hospital with her husband Jack there for support, it's unlikely that she was permitted other visitors, and during her son's first month of life, the royal would have been largely housebound with just her household and support bubble meeting August.  Eugenie with little August at the late Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations  Eugenie's pregnancy was similar, with much of her nine months expecting spent in lockdown unable to do the normal things an expectant mum usually does. Antenatal classes, baby showers, and pregnancy scans with family members all had restrictions upon them.  During the final weeks of her pregnancy, Eugenie and Jack stayed at Frogmore Cottage in the Windsor estate, close to her parents and the late Queen Elizabeth.  © Getty Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank  Fast forward to May 2023, and life is back to normal post-pandemic.  As Eugenie approaches her due date, she is surely over the moon at the freedom accompanying her second birth. Should she wish, other family members can visit her in hospital – if she opts for a similar birth setting this time around.  Then when the royal mother takes baby number two home, she is free to welcome any visitors she chooses. Eugenie will also be able to take her baby to shops, restaurants and baby groups – something she missed out on with baby August.  © Chris Jackson Sarah Ferguson's daughter Princess Eugenie  On Monday, the princess hinted she has begun her maternity leave.  The royal shared photographs and videos of her older sister, Princess Beatrice and Beatrice's husband, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, visiting one of the gardens linked to one of Eugenie's patronages at the Chelsea Flower Show.  Eugenie wrote on Instagram Stories: ""@horatiosgarden at @the_rhs Chelsea this year, a garden specially designed for those who are patients in spinal centres.  ""I'm such a proud patron of this charity and my sister loved visiting yesterday.""

Now, those siblings are high school graduates.  The Horton family welcomed five children into the world in difficult circumstances as the father was severely wounded in Iraq shortly before they were born.  Coira, Portter, Lachlan, Addyson and Caitlynn Horton weighed less than two pounds each at birth and were initially hospitalized in critical condition.  18 years later, they're now graduates of Sky View High School in Smithfield and they're ready to take on a new challenge: adulthood.  ""I was just thinking the other day, in the moment with them, time has gone by so slow,"" reflected their mother, Taunacy Horton. ""Then at the same time, it's gone by so fast.""  Sadly, Addyson died just 19 days after she was born but her memory lives on in the lives of each of her siblings.  ""I'm a mother of quintuplets, I had five babies at one time,"" Taunacy said. ""Even though people see four of them, in our home, there's always five.""  At birthdays, there were five cakes and at major life milestones, they took the time to remember and honor Addyson. High school graduation was no different.  To honor their sister, Coira, Portter, Lachlan and Caitlynn all donned a Gerber daisy with an ""A"" on their graduation gowns.  FOX 13 News A Gerber Daisy placed on the gown of each of the quintuplets remembers Addyson Horton, who died at 19 days old.  ""They're very aware of her and I know that they wanted her to be here today and she is,"" Taunacy said. ""Wherever they go in life, she'll be there with them and that's always brought me peace.""  All four siblings said they wanted to do something special for their sister and wish she was there to collect her own diploma.  ""It's kind of special because I really want to do achievements for her,"" Caitlynn reflected. ""So this is one big one that I can do for her.""  ""In a way, [it's] a little sad but also exciting because it's like she's walking with us on the stage,"" Coira added.  Though the quintuplets may look similar, they all have very different interests and they're now headed in separate directions for the first time in their lives.  Coira is the oldest and will stay close to home at Utah State University, where she's planning to study wildlife and ecology. Her long-term goal is to become a park ranger.  ""I am the oldest by one minute...I make sure they all know that,"" she laughed. ""It's exciting, I don't know what to think about it, don't know how to feel about it yet.""  FOX 13 News Coira Horton, the oldest quintuplet, plans to attend Utah State University  Next is Portter, who is still determining what's next for him. He's grateful for the unique opportunity he's had as a quintuplet and knows one thing for sure; he loves to sing.  ""Choir's been a blast,"" he said ahead of his graduation performance of the song ""This Little Light of Mine."" ""I'll be singing tonight in the choir.""  FOX 13 News Portter Horton is still determining what's next for him but has loved his experience in choir  Lachlan plans to head back to his birthplace of Illinois to be with his father and pursue community college.  ""Ever since kind of an early age...I've always been interested in history,"" he explained. ""So, I'm going to go into history and maybe teaching.""  FOX 13 News Lachlan Horton will head back to his birthplace in Illinois, where he wants to study history  The youngest of the group, Caitlynn, wore a space suit under her graduation gown and has her sights set on being an astronaut.

FOX 13 News Caitlynn Horton wears a space suit under her gown, hinting at her dream to become an astronaut  It's a bittersweet day for the Horton family as one door closes and four individual doors open in the lives of each of the quints.

Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse, alongside 26 other senators, reintroduced the Affordability is Access Act Wednesday to ensure women across the country have access to over-the-counter birth control without a prescription.  “At a time when Republicans are making it harder for women to access health care, including contraception, this critical legislation would ensure that women are able to access affordable, FDA-approved birth control, whether by prescription or over-the-counter,” Reed said. “Contraception is health care and every woman deserves to make their own private medical decisions.”  The bill would ensure coverage for all FDA-approved birth control medications by all private insurers, as well as maintain the FDA’s role to approve these drugs and ensure that retailers provide them without a prescription.  “These extremists have made clear that their attack on women’s rights won’t stop with abortion care, and they’ve already set their sights on curbing contraception access,” Whitehouse said. “If the FDA decides to make birth control more accessible to women by offering it over the counter, Congress should make sure it can still be covered by insurance.”  The legislation is led by Sens. Patty Murray of Washington, Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, alongside 23 other lawmakers. There is companion legislation in the House of Representatives led by Reps.

Georgina O’Shea, who is in her 30s, had her first child, Leon, when she was just a teen.  But every time she tried to get pregnant after Leon, she was forced to go through the trauma of losing the baby.  Ms O'Shea turned to the US for help, seeking out a specialist who put her on trial drugs in the hopes it would help bring the baby to full term.  Four years ago, she told a local radio host in her hometown of Cork, Ireland, that every time she fell pregnant she was racked with ""fear and anxiety"" rather than feelings of happiness and hopefulness.  “No matter how much you try to think it (miscarriage) is not going to happen it does. I don’t envy anybody that falls pregnant or had a child. I would never begrudge anybody having a child.  Image: Georgina O’Shea) Georgina O’Shea)  ""I am still standing. I can still get on with life,"" she told the Neil Prendeville Show on Cork's Red FM.  ""Comments can hurt more than going through the physical miscarriage. But I just think what is meant for you won’t pass you by.”  After resigning herself to the fact that she may never have a second child, Georgina found herself pregnant last September. She and her husband Ken welcomed a daughter, Reilly, six days ago at CUMH, reports the Irish Daily Mirror.  Georgina contacted the radio show with her good news. She told Neil Prendeville that Reilly was her “little miracle”.  “She was given to us unexpectedly. We weren’t planning or we weren’t even hopeful I suppose,"" she said. ""We randomly did a test and it was positive and it took off from there.  ""We had an ectopic pregnancy since the last time I spoke to the show so they have removed one of my tubes and they told me that the other tube was so badly scarred that the chances of me even carrying a pregnancy again were very slim.  ""We gave up hope. We started moving on with life. And then we found out we were pregnant and there was a whirlwind of emotions not knowing what to expect. We found out with the doctor (Professor Keelin O’Donoghue) who has been with us for our whole journey.  ""She then booked us in for every second week to keep a very close eye on it. In one sense (miscarriages) became normal. It was always expected. So you build up a barrier against yourself to protect your own mental health.  ""So every time I fell pregnant I felt sorrow and not joy. Kind of a ‘I know where this is going'. The last pregnancy before baby Reilly that ended in an ectopic was the only pregnancy we had hope for because everything was going as it should have went but it ended in disaster.  ""When things were going right with this pregnancy I just thought ‘it is meant to be.’ There was a little glimmer of hope with this pregnancy.”  Georgina said every scan she went to found her pregnancy progressing to a place she hadn’t been since she gave birth to her son Leon who is now 19.  “Even though we were seeing progression I always had the barrier in the back of my head that it was going to be taken away from me. I had a sense of detachment until 23 weeks when I knew it was a viable pregnancy. From 23 weeks I started to accept I was pregnant.  ""Ken had as many nerves as I had. Leon my son was just as positive. Fear hit me at thirty weeks because we were so close but so far. It was mentally tough. The weeks flew in and flew by.  ""The birth was extremely emotional. I remember looking at Ken when she was born and his face was soaked with tears. He was crying before she was even out. The birth was 45 minutes long. Leon, my son always wanted another sibling but to wait nineteen years for one.  ""The staff brought Leon in to the labour room after she was born to allow him to meet her.

Stevenson said making oral contraceptives more widely accessible has so many positive impacts on health, economic well-being and more. Her research has shown access to birth control can boost both high school and college graduation rates, and she said she’s finalizing evidence that increased access to contraceptives reduces women’s chances of living in poverty.  “Pregnancy is a very intense physical experience, so if you can plan when you experience that or you can terminate a pregnancy at a time that’s not good for your body or your life, then that has impacts for your health and it also has impacts for the rest of your life,” Stevenson said.  Jennifer Hendricks is a professor of law and co-director of the Juvenile and Family Law Program at the University of Colorado Law School. She said the recommendation is a good thing that women, health advocates and doctors have wanted for some time.  “Anything we can do to increase women’s ability to control their bodies is urgently needed,” Hendricks said.  However, she said there are some concerns from the FDA about the approval of an over the counter birth control pill, including women not being able to have a doctor to go over health risks and instructions with them.  “I understand those concerns, and it would be great if we had a health care system where everyone had that kind of attentive medical care and could easily get an appointment,” Hendricks said.  “But in a world where health care is low quality, expensive, very hard for many people to access and women are risking all kinds of physical harms … just for the possibility of becoming pregnant, anything that increases women’s ability to control their own lives is important.”  Stevenson said having access to birth control is important because having babies is important, and it allows people greater control of when or if they have a baby.  She said it’s easy for people who have private health insurance and a regular source of medical care to underestimate the challenges of someone who is uninsured, underinsured or without a regular source of care.  “A lot of evidence by me and other scholars has found that there are substantial barriers to getting contraception and to getting the method of contraception that you want in this country,” Stevenson said.  “And so, when policies make it easier for people to get the methods of contraception that they want, that makes it easier for people to plan their lives, and planning your life makes your life better.”  If approved, the vote would apply only to Opill, a progestin-only pill.  “It’s really just the beginning of what will hopefully be an expansion of the provision of oral contraception over the counter more broadly,” Stevenson said. “I’m very hopeful that this is just the first step.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5Y2FtZXJhLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzI0L2N1LWJvdWxkZXItcHJvZmVzc29ycy1leWUtZmRhLXByZXNjcmlwdGlvbi1mcmVlLWJpcnRoLWNvbnRyb2wtcGlsbC1kZWNpc2lvbtIBd2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5Y2FtZXJhLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzI0L2N1LWJvdWxkZXItcHJvZmVzc29ycy1leWUtZmRhLXByZXNjcmlwdGlvbi1mcmVlLWJpcnRoLWNvbnRyb2wtcGlsbC1kZWNpc2lvbi9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"birth","1966-05-04","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-24T09:46:56","The birth control pill traces its origins to an unexpected place: an infertility clinic.  It all started in the 1950s with an odd scientific couple, two Massachusetts men known for their expertise in reproduction — not the opposite.  John Rock was a devout Catholic who ran a renowned clinic in Brookline for patients who were having difficulty getting pregnant. Gregory Pincus was a biologist who gained notoriety after performing in vitro fertilization in a rabbit. At the time, the idea of using outside intervention to create a new life was highly contentious.  By 1960, Rock and Pincus would become famous for creating the first oral contraceptives. But first, they had to develop and test this innovation, which has since been used by hundreds of millions of women around the world.  Drug regulators are currently considering whether to make a birth control pill available over the counter in the U.S. This milestone has prompted some historians and advocates to revisit the pill's quirky and controversial beginnings.  Discovery in Massachusetts  Women came from around the world to see Rock, a Harvard-trained gynecologist and obstetrician, at his clinic.  “It was the baby boom and they wanted desperately to be pregnant,” said Margaret Marsh, a historian of reproductive medicine at Rutgers University.  John Rock, who died in 1984. Rock was one of the developers of the birth control pill and founder of an infertility clinic. (Pictorial Parade/Getty Images)  Rock had a theory that his patients were struggling to conceive because of what he called an “underdeveloped” reproductive system. He planned to give them hormones theorizing the treatment would let their systems rest and then restart.  Back then, there was little in the way of research ethics and patients often had no idea they were part of an experiment. But Rock did things differently for the 80 women he enlisted in his trial.  “He was a real unicorn,” said Marsh. “He never asked women to be part of a research study unless he explained to them everything that was going on.”  Not far away, Pincus was conducting his own research out of a converted carriage house in Shrewsbury. His work on in vitro fertilization was a scientific breakthrough, but it was so contentious that many historians believe it helped cost him tenure at Harvard.  As he rebuilt his career, he received support from prominent feminists, including Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood, and philanthropist Katharine Dexter McCormick. Their directive: develop an oral contraceptive.  Pincus hired doctors to experiment on women — and men, too — at a state mental hospital. Using methods that were common at the time, he didn’t tell the patients what he was doing, although he did get consent from their families.  Pincus and Rock differed in how they approached patients, but they were working with the same hormones, and before long, they decided to team up. Looking at uterine tissue from Rock’s patients, they realized none of the women were ovulating. They concluded that the hormones could act as birth control.  There was just one problem, Marsh explained: “In Massachusetts during this time, birth control was prohibited. It was against the law.”  Controversy in Puerto Rico  Pincus and Rock scrambled to figure out where to conduct a bigger trial. In letters between the researchers and their patrons, they considered Japan and Hawaii. But, the men ended up heading south to Puerto Rico, which was already a U.S. territory.  A key factor in selecting Puerto Rico was the fact that birth control was legal there, and had been since the late 1930s, said Marsh. Plus, the researchers had medical colleagues on the island, and many of the doctors there had been trained in the U.S.  Although birth control was legal, the trial was immediately contentious.  “Before anybody swallowed the pill, there was controversy,” said Marsh.  The Catholic Church was a vocal opponent, remembered Edris Rice-Wray, the doctor in Puerto Rico who ran Pincus and Rock’s trial.  Biologist Gregory Pincus, in London, on May 4, 1966. He was a professor at the Foundation for Experimental Biology in Shrewsbury. (Keystone-France/Gamma-Keystone via Getty Images)  “The priest would denounce the method we were using in the pulpit, and then the women would run in the next day and say, ‘What is it the priest said we couldn’t have?’ ” said Rice-Wray in an oral history recorded before her death, which is now part of Smith College's special collections.  “We couldn't get enough pills because, as soon as we got started, everybody wanted to get on it,” Rice-Wray remembered.  About 800 women signed up to take the pills. Many of them lived in a nearby housing project.  It is not clear whether these women were told this new medication was still experimental. What is known is that three women died, although no investigations of their deaths were conducted.  The dose the women were given was many times higher than birth control pills today. That caused many of the women to experience severe side effects, including nausea, dizziness and headaches. But Pincus dismissed their symptoms.  “They even said that many of the effects were psychological because we Puerto Rican women are hyperactive emotionally,” said Lourdes Lugo-Ortiz, a professor at the University of Puerto Rico.  Pincus was dismissive because he didn’t want anything to stand in the way of the drug’s success, according to Lugo-Ortiz. And he appeared convinced the drug was safe, explained Marsh.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndidXIub3JnL25ld3MvMjAyMy8wNS8yNC9vcmFsLWNvbnRyYWNlcHRpdmVzLWhpc3RvcnktcHVlcnRvLXJpY28tdGVzdGluZy1tYXNzYWNodXNldHRzLWV0aGljc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

There are rumors going around that Kailyn is ""pregnant with twins"" and is leaving clues to fans on social media.  The Teen Mom star recently shared a videoon her Instagram story of her youngest son, Creed, two, whom she shares with her ex-Chris Lopez.  4 Teen Mom fans believe they've spotted another clue that Kailyn was ""pregnant with twins"" Credit: Instagram/kaillowry  4 Fans spotted a bouncer in the back of a new video she posted on her Instagram Story Credit: Instagram/kaillowry  The tot was all geared up to play baseball with a mitt and helmet on.  Kailyn then asked him if he was going to a baseball game with them and if he was going to play in the game — to which the child responded: ""Yeah.""  However, fans took note of what was behind the tot — which is believed to be a baby bouncer.  FANS REACT  One fan took a screenshot and shared it to a popular Teen Mom internet forum.  The original Reddit poster captioned the post: ""Here's my contribution to babygate 2022/2023.""  ""At this point is it really a conspiracy theory anymore? I think it’s pretty much confirmed now,"" one fan said.  Another mentioned, ""It bothers me how it’s right in front of the TV.""  ""I just don’t understand how or why she would keep things like that out,"" a third pointed out.  A fourth joked, ""You guys should work for the fbi lol I love it.""  ""Conveniently takes the pic where her kid isn’t even in the center of it..she knows what she’s doing,"" said a fifth.  Another wrote, ""Yes! I came here to post this same picture! Definitely baby stuff.""  'MOM OF SEVEN'  Earlier this week, fans shared a new theory she is pregnant with twins in a video.  The MTV star stunned fans with a clue that she is pregnant with twins shared on her social media.  The reality star took to her Instagram Stories on Monday night to promote Hiya Health vitamins.  The TV personality addressed the camera as she spoke about the benefits of the product to her followers.  ""If you guys have not tried the Hiya Health vitamins for your kids you're missing out.  ""First of all, Lux made this little jar with his stickers, he's obsessed,"" she explained, showing off a small yellow container with the tiny tot's name written out with stickers.  She continued: ""He only has a couple left in here but no sweat because our next order came.  ""Hiya is truly reimagining children's health and I love them because you know exactly what is in the vitamins.  ""I feel like people don't actually know what's in those gummy vitamins and I'm guilty of that too, I had no idea,"" she admitted.  Kailyn then began unpacking a box of vitamins, showing off the sticker decorations that come with the product.  The Teen Mom alum tasted one of the little gummies on camera, gushing over their flavor.  Throughout the entire video, the young mom flashed a colorful bracelet on her left wrist.  Eagle-eyed fans zoomed in on the beaded jewelry noticing that it said: ""Mom of seven.""  KAIL'S SLIP-UP  Kailyn recently revealed that she has a newborn baby at home in a shocking comment on her podcast — making this baby number five.  The TV personality might have finally confirmed that she welcomed her fifth child after months of silence on the matter.  The busy mom seemingly let it slip that she had another little one during Thursday's episode of Coffee Convos.  It happened while the reality star discussed the challenges of vacationing with young children with her co-host Lindsie Chrisley, 33.  While Lindsie favored traveling with youngsters, Kailyn wasn't keen on the idea, despite taking her four children on numerous getaways over the years.  ""Creed is about to be three this summer, and I would say only now is it, I feel like fun to watch them interact on a vacation,"" the TV star admitted, mentioning her fourth-born son.  ""I've taken all my kids on vacations as small children, and now that I'm older, I'm like, first of all, they're not gonna remember.""  As Kailyn's explanation continued, she appeared to reveal that she had another child younger than Creed when she referenced a six-month-old.  ""Second of all, I don't want to get up early to essentially just do the same things I'm gonna do at home with a six-month-old in a tropical location. Or a cabin location or whatever the case may be.  ""If that's important to you, and you want to do that, and you don't mind, then do it. I think it really depends on how you feel, but for me, I've done it, and I just don't think for me, it's just not a fun time,"" the Teen Mom 2 alum concluded.  BABY MAMA  In February, The U.S. Sun broke the news that Kailyn gave birth to her fifth child with her fourth baby daddy, Elijah Scott, 24, in November.  However, the young mom has remained tight-lipped on the subject, despite fans believing they found multiple clues that she gave birth.  In addition to her sons Creed, and Lux, with Chris, Kailyn is also a mom to a 13-year-old son, Isaac, with her ex Jo Rivera, and a nine-year-old son, Lincoln, with her ex-husband, Javi Marroquin.  4 Kailyn recently revealed that she has a newborn baby at home on her podcast Credit: Instagram/kaillowry","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvODIwMzc4OC90ZWVuLW1vbS1rYWlseW4tbG93cnktZmFucy1zcG90LWZpZnRoLWJhYnktY2x1ZS_SAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGUtc3VuLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50LzgyMDM3ODgvdGVlbi1tb20ta2FpbHluLWxvd3J5LWZhbnMtc3BvdC1maWZ0aC1iYWJ5LWNsdWUvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Our team could not be prouder of how attentive Leia has been with her firstborn,"" Giraffe zookeepers Kristi Myers, Jason Balder, Mary Wilson and Kelly Davis said in a statement.Giraffe calves are typically five to 6 feet tall and 150-200 pounds when born. This calf appears to be within those healthy parameters. Giraffes are pregnant for a long 14 to 15 months.Giraffes are the tallest land animals. Female giraffes are up to 14 feet tall and weigh up to 1,500 pounds. Meanwhile, males are up to 18 feet tall and can weigh 3,000 pounds. At this height, a giraffe can look into a second-story window. Male and female giraffes can live to about 25 years in the wild and even longer under human care.Fun fact: No two giraffes have the same coat pattern, like human fingerprints.Giraffes are native to sub-Saharan Africa and are very social animals, traveling in large towers (herds) of all ages and sexes.They are listed as a ""vulnerable"" species according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and approximately 68,000 are found in the wild, with numbers decreasing because of habitat loss, poaching (illegal hunting), and disease threatening their distribution throughout Africa. The zoo’s giraffe tower now numbers five – males Jack, Turbo, and calf, and females Leia and Amelia.

"birth","2009-07-24","Not Discerned","{""Alexandria"", ""Virginia"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-24T20:36:00","As much as I hate to give any of my precious attention to Lauren Boebert because she is truly an awful specimen, sometimes, however, she says something so stupid I have to stop my day just so I can figuratively point and laugh at her. Today, friends, is an example of that. Join me, won’t you?  See, Boebert recently said—in her official capacity as a sitting member of Congress—that having a child was cheaper than filling a prescription for birth control. I’m not kidding, watch for yourself:  And then she voted against the right to contraception so she could double this problem and give it to the next person https://t.co/NkNWzH3Jqt — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) May 23, 2023  Her quote from that clip, in full:  I left a prescription at a pharmacy once. I went to get birth control, and I was there at the counter and went to pay for it and the price was very, very high. I said, ‘Wow, is this a three, six month prescription?’ ‘No ma’am, this is one month.’ And I said, ‘It’s cheaper to have a kid.’ And I left it there, and now I have my third son, Kaydon Boebert so it actually turned out to be a really great thing.  Since this is a fascist MAGA we’re talking about, obviously Boebert has tried her damndest in Congress to restrict access to birth control. As her colleague Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was quick to point out, Boebert voted against the Right to Contraception Act last summer, which increased access to affordable birth control. It never ends does it?  Boebert had her third child in 2009 (whom she gave birth to in a pickup truck—an act she has since tried to spin with bizarre logic as justification for denying people parental leave), right before the Affordable Care Act took effect in March of 2010, which rendered birth control effectively free if you have health insurance. Even back in the dark ages of no Obamacare (may we never go back to those times) there were ways to get birth control relatively cheaply, I say from experience. In 2007/2008—approximately the time Boebert was supposedly choosing not to fill her birth control prescription—I enrolled in a birth control pill club that cost me $19.99 per year when I was uninsured and paid $30 per month for my prescription. That’s still way more than anyone should have to pay for birth control but I promise you, even a broke early-20-something me knew that $30 a month was infinitely cheaper than getting pregnant, carrying that pregnancy to term, and having a child. When have facts ever mattered though? It’s much easier to make bonkers claims and speak them confidently as facts from the floor of the House of Representatives instead of showing any sort of responsibility for the truth. Especially when you’re Lauren Boebert.  So here are some fun facts: the average cost to raise a single child up to age 17 in America is $310,605 if they were born in 2015, according to Investopedia. Now, look, I am an English major and Boebert’s third child was born in 2009, so if you want to know the monetary approximation for that child specifically, you gotta crunch the numbers yourself. Although according to the same article, subsequent children cost less, because of the “economies of scale” which means, you get to make the kids share a room, the younger sibling gets the older’s hand-me-down, and you can buy food in bulk saving money in the long run. So take that into account, but I think the real takeaway here is that raising a child in America is f-ing expensive and you could almost buy a home outright in cash for the same cost. (The average home price in America being $348K in 2022)  As a woman in America who has been on birth control in some form or other for the past 23 years, I can guarantee you that my expenditure over that time is nowhere near $300k even if you take into account my insurance premiums (again, thank you Obamacare!) Also, since we’re on the subject, and I absolutely love false dichotomies—Boebert does understand that condoms cost approximately $1 each, right? Like, she had other options here beyond the binary of filling her birth control prescription or just having a child. As a teen during the Bush years, I seem to recall a heavy push in high school toward abstinence-only sex education. While a crappy option, it still exists and was one Boebert’s party pushed for a very long time—one that, coincidentally, the Obama Administration got rid of fully in 2017 by eliminating all federal funding for it. Gee, another thing we have to be grateful to him, for.  So as a reminder, Boebert remains a liar, and we should all be grateful to Obama and the Democrats for sacrificing the House and getting the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, which ensures virtually all birth control costs are free under a health care exchange plan.

Van de Pijl looked at the experiences of over 11,000 women who answered an online survey about medical intervention while giving birth to fine out if they had been asked permission in advance.  In total, nearly 42% of the women who had undergone an episiotomy said they had not been asked for permission while 43 said they had been cut open, despite refusing to allow it.  In addition, 47% of women said they were given a drug to speed up the placenta being expelled without being asked and 41 were given oxytocin despite saying no.  Not all the women regarded the lack of permission as a problem but most did. “Each patient is different but it is important that a woman knows what is happening to her and her baby during the birth process,” Van der Pijl told broadcaster NOS. “Good communication is essential.”  An episiotomy involved cutting into the perineum to give a baby more room to emerge. The aim is to prevent more serious tearing and allow a baby to be born more quickly if it is in trouble.  Healthcare workers are required by law to ask patients for permission for each medical treatment, a process known as “informed consent”.  “We know that healthcare workers do their best and we cannot conclude why things so often go wrong from this research,” Van der Pijl told NOS.  Some 20% of the women in the survey gave birth at home and 65% had no pain relief.  Have you had a baby in the Netherlands? We’d like to hear about your experiences for an article.

Super fertility cases have recently shocked the world, such as a 30-year-old woman conceiving her second baby just four weeks after getting pregnant with the first.According to various sources, the first known case of quintuplets was the ‘Dionne quintuplets’ born in 1934 in Canada . They were the first documented set of 5 identical children to have survived their infancy.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFodHRwczovL20udGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmNvbS9ldGltZXMvdHJlbmRpbmcvYS13b21hbi1mcm9tLXJhbmNoaS1oYXMtZ2l2ZW4tYmlydGgtdG8tcXVpbnR1cGxldHMtd2l0aGluLXNldmVuLW1vbnRocy1hbmQtaGVyZS1pcy1ob3ctaXQtaGFwcGVuZWQvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvMTAwNDcwNDcxLmNtc9IBqwFodHRwczovL20udGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmNvbS9ldGltZXMvdHJlbmRpbmcvYS13b21hbi1mcm9tLXJhbmNoaS1oYXMtZ2l2ZW4tYmlydGgtdG8tcXVpbnR1cGxldHMtd2l0aGluLXNldmVuLW1vbnRocy1hbmQtaGVyZS1pcy1ob3ctaXQtaGFwcGVuZWQvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93LzEwMDQ3MDQ3MS5jbXM?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"birth","2023-01-25","Not Discerned","{""ChapelHill"", ""NorthCarolina"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-24T11:30:00","I started talking to my doctor about sterilization in the second trimester of my second pregnancy. I’d recently found out I’d need a C-section, thanks to a placental abnormality that made it unsafe for me to go into labor. I was mourning the birth experience I thought I’d get to have, and I felt, on some level, like a failure. Not having to worry about birth control anymore felt like a way to get something positive out of a situation I hadn’t chosen.  My husband and I also knew that, after our second son was born, we didn’t want more children. We only had the space — in our apartment, and also in our minds and lives — for two. I vaguely remembered that older relatives had gotten their “tubes tied” after a C-section, so I asked my obstetrician if that was still an option. She told me the preferred procedure these days is to remove the tubes entirely, an operation called a salpingectomy.  I didn’t know it then, but this brief surgery — it adds about five minutes to a cesarean delivery — was about to have a big moment. In January, the Ovarian Cancer Research Alliance (OCRA) issued a statement recommending that all women consider salpingectomy if they’re having another abdominal surgery and don’t want to have future children. That’s because, in addition to providing permanent birth control, a salpingectomy also reduces the risk of ovarian cancer by up to 50 percent. “This is a very powerful opportunity for cancer prevention,” said Sarah DeFeo, the research alliance’s chief program officer.  Permanent, non-reversible contraception definitely isn’t for everyone. Sterilization in America retains a certain stigma, and doctors are sometimes unwilling to perform it, especially if a patient is young or doesn’t already have kids. The procedure also brings up equity issues, from the long history of American doctors forcibly sterilizing Black women and women with disabilities to the tendency to place the responsibility for birth control solely on women and their bodies.  In the wake of the Dobbs decision, however, interest in all forms of birth control is on the rise. And experts say everyone with fallopian tubes should have the opportunity to consider a salpingectomy, even if they never take it.  Tubal ligation as a method of permanent birth control has been around since the 1880s. The expression “getting your tubes tied” is a misnomer; doctors don’t “tie” patients’ fallopian tubes, says Kavita Arora, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and chair of the ethics committee of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Instead, each tube can be closed off with a clip, band, or ring; it can be cauterized; or it can be cut. The goal is to interrupt the egg’s progress down a fallopian tube so that it can’t encounter sperm and be fertilized.  In a salpingectomy, rather than cutting or obstructing the tubes, doctors simply remove them. The procedure is about as old as tubal ligation, and has long been used as a treatment when a fallopian tube ruptures as a result of an ectopic pregnancy. Over the last decade, however, researchers have come to believe that many ovarian cancers start out in the fallopian tubes. Ovarian cancer is relatively uncommon, with 19,710 women diagnosed in the US every year — for comparison, 264,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer annually — but it is very deadly, accounting for more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive organs. Screening and early detection, unfortunately, do not appear to help patients live longer. That fact has led researchers to look for ways of stopping the disease before it starts.  Salpingectomy looks promising. One 2022 study found that removing the fallopian tubes was associated with significantly lower risk of ovarian cancer: Among 25,889 people who underwent a salpingectomy, none developed the disease during the nine-year study period. Since the procedure leaves the ovaries intact, it doesn’t cause menopause or change a patient’s menstrual cycle. Though the long-term effects are still being studied, “it’s generally considered to have very little impact on quality of life,” DeFeo said. While tubal ligations can sometimes be reversed, removal of the tubes is not reversible. Patients can still become parents, however, by IVF, surrogacy, or adoption.  If it’s done on its own, salpingectomy can have a recovery period of about two weeks. When done as part of another abdominal surgery, like a C-section, hysterectomy, or fibroid removal, the procedure adds very little, if any, to the recovery time. That’s one reason the Ovarian Cancer Research Alliance recommended that patients consider an “opportunistic salpingectomy,” or getting the procedure done when they’re already on the operating table for something else.  I had never heard of a salpingectomy until my doctor mentioned it to me, even though I’ve been reporting on reproductive health for nearly 15 years. At first I was nervous: The idea of permanent birth control appealed to me, but I wasn’t sure if I wanted to lose parts of my body. I was worried that, on some level, I’d miss them, or that I would come out of the procedure feeling somehow different or lesser. I tried to find personal stories of people who’d already been through the procedure, but because salpingectomies for birth control are relatively new, I didn’t find much.  For years, “women were really relying on their clinicians to recommend this, but didn’t have knowledge of it on their own,” DeFeo said. While doctors in major urban centers were often aware of the potential benefits of the procedure, that awareness didn’t always extend across the country, said OCRA CEO Audra Moran, or to other specialties outside of gynecology.  It wasn’t until 2013 that the Society of Gynecologic Oncology recommended that doctors discuss the procedure with patients, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists did the same in 2019. Today, most people who request a tubal ligation will probably be offered a salpingectomy, said Erin Medlin, a gynecologic oncologist at Colorado Permanente Medical Group. The health benefits are thought to be greater, though more conventional tubal ligation may also reduce ovarian cancer risk. In cases where scar tissue or another problem makes the procedure difficult, a more conventional ligation can still be done instead, Medlin said, but generally, doctors today are more likely to perform salpingectomies.  But most people still don’t know the procedure exists. In many ways, my generation of birthing people is the first to be offered opportunistic salpingectomy as an option. “Most women going into this surgery know what their mother had, which was some type of clip placed on their tube, or something of the like,” Medlin said. For people considering the surgery, there simply isn’t a wealth of generational experience to fall back on.  In addition to a lack of knowledge, patients can face another obstacle: doctors’ preconceptions around permanent methods of birth control. Patients have reported being denied sterilization procedures if a doctor perceives them as too young, or if they have not yet had children. “Some of it is very paternalistic,” Arora said.  On the other hand, some patients have historically been pressured or forced into sterilization. Between 1929 and 1974, for example, the state of North Carolina forcibly sterilized more than 7,600 people deemed to be “mentally defective;” the program specifically targeted Black residents. More than 30 states had compulsory sterilization laws on the books in the 20th century, and while many have been repealed, the practice isn’t necessarily a thing of the past. A 2013 investigation found that more than 100 incarcerated women in California had been sterilized without proper approval, and some reported being coerced.  “The history of sterilization is intertwined with the history of eugenics,” said Krystale Littlejohn, a sociology professor at the University of Oregon who studies race, gender, and reproduction. Doctors shouldn’t talk to patients about salpingectomies or any sterilization procedure without being mindful of that history and the danger of repeating that coercion, even unintentionally, experts say. “It’s really important to think about the context in which people are encouraged to use particular methods or to pursue particular surgical options and to think about the deeper meanings that those options have for them,” Littlejohn said.  Getting a salpingectomy or any form of permanent birth control can also be difficult because a certain aura of shame still surrounds the idea. “There are so many parts of women’s health care that are stigmatized, that we don’t talk enough about, whether that’s cesarean deliveries or miscarriages or sterilization or Pap smears,” Medlin said. Even within the realm of reproductive health, sterilization can be tricky to bring up because it’s associated with not wanting children, an attitude that’s still viewed as suspect by many Americans, even as more and more people are choosing to remain child-free. In my own life, I had a much easier time finding information and perspectives about reversible forms of contraception, like the pill or ring, than about a procedure that would be permanent. Even talking about the possibility felt a little taboo; I wondered if I should be embarrassed.  Insurance can also be a hurdle. As a form of birth control, salpingectomy is covered by the contraceptive mandate in the Affordable Care Act, which requires employer-provided health plans to cover birth control without a copay. However, that mandate was significantly weakened by the Trump administration and has never covered people without employer-provided insurance. As of 2021, 10.2 percent of Americans had no health insurance at all; without insurance, a salpingectomy can cost thousands of dollars.  Moreover, conversations around birth control in America, including sterilization, have typically placed the onus on women and people who can become pregnant. “There’s just this expectation that women should be responsible for preventing pregnancy,” Littlejohn said. That inequity often extends to sterilization. By the time they consider such a procedure, many women have already been shouldering for decades the responsibility of birth control. So “it can seem like a natural step for some of them” to be the one to undergo sterilization. Tubal sterilization procedures are more common than vasectomies, even though the latter is often less invasive.  Sterilization in general has been getting more attention since the Dobbs decision last summer resulted in abortion bans in many states. Procedures such as salpingectomy, however, will never be a substitute for abortion rights, Littlejohn said.  “People need bodily autonomy,” she said. “Dobbs is an assault on their bodily and reproductive autonomy, and to suggest that they just get sterilized because they no longer have the option of getting an abortion is also encroaching on their reproductive autonomy.”  At the same time, “clinicians should not impose paternalistic thresholds on whom they will and will not perform permanent contraception on,” Arora said. “The patient is the expert in their own lives.”  When I started discussing sterilization with my doctor, I didn’t necessarily feel like an expert. What helped me decide and feel confident in my decision was talking to other people in my life. My husband and I talked about the pros and cons, but it was clear to both of us that the final vote should be mine; I had already been through a lot to build our family, and if I was going to undergo another medical procedure to finish building it, the decision would have to be mine alone. I also talked to my best friend, who helped me run through a list of all possible scenarios in which I might regret the decision. As we spoke, I began to lose my anxiety and feel, instead, a sense of self-determination.  Ultimately, I decided to get the surgery mostly because of its potential to reduce my cancer risk. There are other methods of birth control, but the idea of a surgery that could protect my future health, and that would be over in a few minutes with minimal side effects, was appealing to me. When the time came, I barely noticed the salpingectomy was happening — I was so focused on the baby who had just been lifted, wailing, from my body.  He’s about 8 months old now, and I’m glad I got the surgery when he was born. If it prevents me from getting ovarian cancer, I’ll never know it — that’s the nature of prevention. But it’s a choice the Ovarian Cancer Research Alliance wants more patients to have. “We’re not advocating for every single woman in America to have an opportunistic salpingectomy,” Moran said, “but just to talk about it and ask the questions.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZveC5jb20vZXZlbi1iZXR0ZXIvMjM3MzAwNzgvYmlydGgtY29udHJvbC1jb250cmFjZXB0aW9uLW92YXJpYW4tY2FuY2VyLXNhbHBpbmdlY3RvbXktc3RlcmlsaXphdGlvbtIBfGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZveC5jb20vcGxhdGZvcm0vYW1wL2V2ZW4tYmV0dGVyLzIzNzMwMDc4L2JpcnRoLWNvbnRyb2wtY29udHJhY2VwdGlvbi1vdmFyaWFuLWNhbmNlci1zYWxwaW5nZWN0b215LXN0ZXJpbGl6YXRpb24?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

House Bill 457, sponsored by Rep. Raymond Crews, R-Bossier City, encourages doctors to tell people who lost pregnancies at 20 weeks or earlier that they are entitled to a government-issued certificate commemorating the event.    Like a government-issued birth certificate, this miscarriage certificate would be required to list the name and gender of the lost fetus if that information is known.    If no name is given, the state vital records staff would be required to list Baby, Baby Boy or Baby Girl in the first-name slot on the certificate. The last name of the person who lost the pregnancy would also be automatically assigned to the fetus and included on the document.    The miscarriage certificate would have a disclaimer that it is not “proof of a live birth,” and the state would be prohibited from using these documents to calculate live birth statistics.    But people who experience a miscarriage might not be able to stop a doctor or medical professional from broaching the subject of a commemorative certificate, even if they don’t believe a lost fetus is the equivalent of a baby.    The legislation leaves the decision about whether a commemorative certificate is discussed after a miscarriage up to the doctor, midwife or medical facility that treats the patient — not the person who lost the pregnancy.    An earlier version of the bill went even farther. Initially, Crews wanted to require all doctors, midwives and others who treat people for miscarriages to offer the miscarriage certificate to their patients.  But Crews pulled back on that mandate early in the legislative process, changing his bill’s language to allow doctors and other medical professionals to choose whether they talk about the certificates with their patients.    The bill has already gotten approval from the Louisiana House and the Senate Committee on Health and Welfare. It now awaits a vote from the full Senate and consideration from Gov. John Bel Edwards.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vbGFpbGx1bWluYXRvci5jb20vYnJpZWZzL21pc2NhcnJpYWdlLWNlcnRpZmljYXRlcy1zaW1pbGFyLXRvLWJpcnRoLWNlcnRpZmljYXRlcy1jb3VsZC1zb29uLWJlLWlzc3VlZC1pbi1sb3Vpc2lhbmEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Anastasia Tsirtsakis 25/05/2023 3:10:22 PM New Australian research into elective induction of labour at 39 weeks gestation has revealed good news for mothers and their health outcomes.  Researchers say the findings can be used to inform shared decision making between pregnant patients and their health care providers.  When it comes to giving birth, intervention is on the rise.    In 2020, around one in three (35%) of all labouring mothers and 46% of first-time mothers in Australia had an induced labour. That is up from around 26% of first-time mothers in 2010.    If an induction is being planned, evidence indicates that if there are no medical or obstetric reasons for an earlier birth, then waiting until at least 39 weeks is best for the baby, with the last few weeks of pregnancy important for brain and lung development.    But what is best for mothers?    A new study has provided further reassurance for those electing to be induced at 39 weeks gestation, as it is found to be associated with better health outcomes for women.    Researchers from the University of Melbourne Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology analysed data from 14 studies, including the experiences of more than 1.6 million women, to examine the impact of an elective induction at 39 weeks.    They found that inducing labour at that gestation is associated with a 37% decreased risk of perineal injury.    Study co-lead Dr Roxanne Hastie told newsGP it is the first metanalysis of this size to confirm that inducing labour protects labouring mothers, as well as being safe for their babies.    ‘Our findings reported that there is almost a 40% reduction in perineal injury for mothers, so third- or fourth-degree tears, which are a consequence for a lot of women,’ she said.    In Australia, severe perineal injury affects up to one in 20 women who have a vaginal birth. These injuries often require surgery and can take many months to heal.    As a result, Dr Hastie said that perineal injury is ‘definitely a concern for a lot of women’.    She said the findings are ‘reassuring’ and that they can now be used by clinicians, including GPs in a shared care arrangement, to assist pregnant patients when creating a suitable birth plan.    ‘It’s important that women do have this information so that they can make informed decisions with their healthcare providers when they are deciding how and when to birth their babies,’ Dr Hastie said.    Meanwhile, the study also found that the benefits for women electing to be induced at 39 weeks extend beyond avoiding serious perineal injury.    ‘We also found a reduction in emergency caesarean sections and also the need for assisted births – so vacuum or forceps,’ Dr Hastie said.    This is contrary to what the Australian Institute and Welfare states on its website. Drawing on research from 2012, it claims that while most women who have induced labour do well, as do their babies, that induction of labour ‘does increase the risk of emergency caesarean section’ compared to spontaneous labour.    However, Dr Hastie says this is a misconception from inaccurate research conducted in the 1970s that persisted until the 2000s.    ‘They compared women having an induction of labour to those who gave birth spontaneously at the same gestation. But it’s not the appropriate group given you can’t really determine who is going to have a spontaneous birth,’ she said.    ‘The ARRIVE Trial in 2018 really solidified that; it was a very well-designed clinical trial that showed quite clearly that induction of labour was not associated with an emergency caesarean section.’    In the decade since 2010, the rate of spontaneous labour fell from 56% to 41%, corresponding with increases in the rates of induced labour and no labour. In 2020, the main reasons for inducing labour were diabetes (15%), prolonged pregnancy (12%) and pre-labour rupture of membranes (11%).    While the study did find that labour at 39 weeks was associated with improved maternal labour-related and neonatal outcomes, among nulliparous women, induction was associated with shoulder dystocia, with the authors noting that this potential risk ‘should be discussed’ with the relevant patient cohort.    Though Dr Hastie says she is a proponent of evidence as power, she notes that elective induction will not be suitable for all women who have yet to go into spontaneous labour at 39 weeks.    ‘We’re not saying that all women should have an induction, but that this is the evidence so that people can feel informed when they make decisions around birthing,’ she said.

Celis, 29, said she was enjoying the largest electronic dance music festival in North America, as she’s done for five years.  “Every year as soon as tickets go out, I purchase them and you know already kind of started planning,” she said.  The Santa Clarita, California native was not worried about being between 31-32 weeks pregnant and traveling out of state last Thursday to attend the festival.  “Literally had a doctor's appointment that morning I came (to Las Vegas) so everything was still good.""  However, she realized something was not right while enjoying Zedd’s performance a few days later.  “Vibing to the music, listening and then I just get like this random weird feeling,” Celis said. “So, I decided to go to first aid to get assessed. Then they transferred me to the main first aid tent.”  She said after speaking with medical staff at the rave, she was transferred to University Medical Center in an ambulance early Sunday morning.  “Then like 15-20 minutes later, Izzabella was born,” Celis said. ""It was crazy, wasn't expecting it at all. ""  Coming weeks before her due date and weighing 3 lbs 1 oz. Celis and her 30-year-old boyfriend, Jonny Garcia, decided to name her Izzabella Daisy Garcia.  “We added the extra “Z” in honor for Zedd because that's technically where she went into labor,” Garcia said. “We put Daisy for the Electric Daisy Carnival, so that's why we put Daisy as her middle name.""

"birth","2017-09-21","Not Discerned","{""Stanford"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-24T22:55:44","NEW YORK – An international team led by investigators at Stanford University School of Medicine has unearthed maternal features associated with preterm birth in several low- and middle-income countries using a combination of multiomics and machine learning.  The work builds on previous research highlighting a range of epidemiological factors — ranging from body mass index (BMI), socioeconomic status, or environmental exposures to short intervals between pregnancies, previous delivery by cesarean section, or a history of adverse pregnancy outcomes — that can influence an individual's preterm birth risk.  ""Preterm birth is the single largest cause of death in children under 5, both in low- and high-income countries,"" co-senior and corresponding author Nima Aghaeepour, a researcher at Stanford and vice chair of research in data science, said in an email.  ""[U]sing machine learning and multiomics analysis, we have demonstrated that … epidemiologic factors don't belong in the same 'bucket,'"" Aghaeepour explained. ""They each impact biology differently, and likely have their own specific influence on the biology for prematurity.""  As they reported in Science Advances on Wednesday, the researchers brought together maternal data for more than 13,800 samples from pregnant participants at five sites in Bangladesh, Zambia, Pakistan, and Tanzania. They turned to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry for untargeted metabolomic and targeted lipidomic analyses on mid-pregnancy blood plasma samples for a subset of 231 individuals. Multiplex proteomic profiling on nearly 1,200 proteins in the blood samples was performed at Olink Proteomics.  Together with clinical profiles for the maternal participants, and machine learning-based preterm birth prediction models based on various clinical and epidemiological features, the multiomic profiles provided a biological perspective on the epidemiological risk factors linked to preterm birth in this and previous studies.  The results suggested that fetal and placental proteins such as placental alkaline phosphatase (ALPP), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), and placental growth factor (PGF) tend to coincide with time-to-delivery and the presence of certain pregnancy-related steroid hormones, for example.  Time-to-delivery also tracked with certain immune proteins such as the programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), C-C motif chemokine ligand 28 (CCL28), and the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR), but was negatively correlated with levels of a metabolite called cortolone glucuronide.  The team found that increasing maternal age was linked to lower-than-usual levels of the type IX collagen protein COL9A1, on the other hand. Meanwhile, levels of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and the inflammatory chemokine CXCL13 tracked with gravidity, or the number of pregnancies an individual has had.  Leptin, structural protein fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), lipid-associated perilipin 1 (PLIN1), and certain metabolic pathway contributors appeared to be positively associated with maternal BMI, the researchers reported, while other compounds had negative ties to BMI. In the current analysis, preterm birth tended to be more common in individuals with lower-than-usual BMI.  ""Our study provides an integrated view of how previously identified epidemiological associations such as parity [number of previous births], BMI, and age are etiologically connected to an underlying biology evidenced by various 'omic correlates,"" the authors reported. ""This integrated view was possible by leveraging a large, multinational cohort together with multiomic profiling in a subcohort to simultaneously explore the population-level correlates of [preterm birth] and how these associate with individual women's biology.""  Consequently, the authors suggested that the study may help in improving the performance of preterm birth prediction models, which are typically based on population-level data that can be difficult to apply to individuals, thus improving the likelihood that related interventions may be more broadly beneficial.  ""This is a first step towards precision medicine for these patients,"" Aghaeepour said.  ""Neither biology nor epidemiology is going to address this disease in isolation,"" he suggested. ""We need to bring these two fields together, and machine learning is the perfect channel for enabling these two otherwise separate fields to communicate with each other.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdlbm9tZXdlYi5jb20vcmVwcm9kdWN0aXZlLWhlYWx0aC9wcmV0ZXJtLWJpcnRoLWJpb2xvZ3ktdW5yYXZlbGVkLW11bHRpb21pY3MtbWFjaGluZS1sZWFybmluZ9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

When it comes to rising stars, there is the bright new light: Marsai Martin. As one of the newest “It” girls in Hollywood, she has already begun to build a legacy before the age of 18.  Best known for her role in the ABC sitcom “Black-ish” alongside megastar Anthony Anderson, in 2014 Martin broke records and was recognized by the Guinness World Records for being the youngest person to serve as an executive producer on a major Hollywood film for her work in front of and behind the scenes on “Little.”  She continued to raise the bar for her peers, making waves as a producer, actress and voiceover artist in films “Spirit Untamed” and “PAW Patrol: The Movie.” Then in 2019 she was bestowed with the honor of landing a coveted spot on the “Time 100 Next” list.  So what has catapulted her to super stardom? Did she get a lucky break or is there something more cosmic at work here? Will she go on to define a generation or end up going in a whole new direction down the line?  Join me as we dive into her stars because I’m a pop culture astrologer and I can see it all.  Marsai Martin has a fiery Leo Sun. Getty Images for BET  Marsai Martin’s birth chart shows she’s a manifestor  Marsai Martin was born on August 14, 2004. This makes her a fiery Leo Sun with a passionate Leo Moon. Her birth time hasn’t been confirmed online or with me directly, so instead, we’ll focus on what we do, in fact, know.  When looking at her elemental energy, we can see that she has a strong emphasis on Earth, followed by Fire and Water. This shows that while she does utilize her heart and emotions to propel her toward her goals, she is ultimately a doer and a manifester of her own destiny, eager to reshape the world around her in very tangible and physical means.  Upon reviewing the key themes within her birth chart, this is seen built into her very cosmic-DNA. Many astrological aspects repeat this pattern, showing that she is someone who was chosen by the great powers above and granted the energy to craft the world.  First, her Sun, which ties to her life force, is perfectly linked to Pluto, the planet of transformation and power. This brings her a mighty and willful personality with a laser focus on being admired, respected and recognized. Her desires and motivations are strong and she has an incredible intensity to her that instantly impacts others around her.  Marsai Martin has a charismatic Leo Moon. Getty Images,  She has no fear expressing her thoughts and beliefs and will champion for them relentlessly until they are built.  Her Jupiter, the planet of miracles and luck, is also gorgeously dancing with her Saturn, the planet of longevity and permanence.  They are exactly aligned in one of the most beautiful ways, which in a sense, reveals that she was chosen to be a leader.  She has always been immensely ambitious and has the integrity and drive to achieve success, which ultimately impresses all who she meets.  She has the bright optimism to inspire, but also the practical nature and judgment to get things done.  She isn’t afraid of putting in the work on her own—but she is also just as happy to delegate to those around her. This determination is further revealed by how her Jupiter also links with Pluto, too.  Marsai Martin’s birth chart reveals that she is a manifestor. Getty Images for Essence  Yet, she also possesses the trailblazing independence to be original and innovative, which can be found within the many other links playing out within her birth chart.  Her Venus, the planet of art, spins with Uranus, the planet of freedom, which empowers her to be unconventional and go against the mold. She craves to be authentic and unique, not only in who she is, but in the professional realm that she exhibits.  Her Mercury, the planet of the mind and communication, embraces Mars, the planet of drive, bringing her incredible mental capacity and assertiveness.  Both of these planets stand opposite Uranus, which brings her the constant desire to break the cage, think outside of the box and make things happen. But she won’t follow the leader. She’ll always crave to do it her own way.  Marsai Martin has exciting years ahead of her, written in the stars. ©Universal/courtesy Everett / E  What are predictions for Marsai Martin?

Muhammad-Mera, gave the advice at the agenda for the state- level kick – off operational plans for birth registration, 2023 in Birnin Kebbi on Monday.  He said,” With increase in population and demands for adequate and proportionate planning for all sectors of human development, it is imperative that in this presentation Birth Registration is not a new program.  “It has been an instrument used by leaders from time in memorial as a foundation for planning and development.  “This calls for the engagement of a structure that’s respected, trusted, recognized and embedded in all targeted communities. In Nigeria only the traditional and religious leaders institutions personifies this descriptions.”  According to him, the traditional and religious institutions are the oldest institutions anywhere in the world.  He said that traditional rulers knew their boundaries and who to report to, adding that the arrangement was centuries old and still respected despite modern political boundaries.  “The Traditional and Religious Leaders in this structure are always present on the seventh day when a child is named.  “Because of the spread and impact of this institution and its historical role in this activity it is only natural to make it the first point of call for Birth Registration.  Muhammad-Mera recommended that the NPC and all stakeholders should try to use the structure of traditional rulers and their personnel for the collection of first basic information such as Name, Date of Birth, Place of Birth and Name of Parents of a new born child .  “All these can be collated at district level (Political Ward) and submitted monthly to Local Government relevant office for submission to State NPC office,” the emir said.  Earlier, the representative of the NPC, Dr Ahmad Muhammad, said the civil registration and vital statistics (eCRVS) held immense significance in the rapidly changing world where information was key and accurate data was the foundation of progress.  “They not only serve as the cornerstone for individual legal identity and the protection of human rights but also play a pivotal role in shaping national policies, decision-making processes, and development strategies.

Muhammad said that the aim of the meeting was not only to familiarize them with the system but also to foster a comprehensive understanding of how it would enhance their capabilities and positively impact our society.  “As we embark on this transformative journey, let us keep in mind the broader purpose of the eCRVS system—to improve the accuracy, accessibility, and efficiency of civil registration and vital statistics.  “By implementing this digital solution, we are not only embracing technological advancement but also laying the foundation for a more inclusive, transparent, and data-driven society,” he said.  Muhammad also commended UNICEF their support in conducting birth registration and certification of 400,000 under five Children in the state, using digital Civil Registration and Vital Statistics.

"birth","2023-11-05","15:24:00","{""Birmingham"", ""Alabama"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T15:38:00","BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) — Angelica Lyons knew it was dangerous for Black women to give birth in America.  As a public health instructor, she taught college students about racial health disparities, including the fact that Black women in the U.S. are nearly three times more likely to die during pregnancy or delivery than any other race. Her home state of Alabama has the third-highest maternal mortality rate in the nation.  Then, in 2019, it nearly happened to her.  What should have been a joyous first pregnancy quickly turned into a nightmare when she began to suffer debilitating stomach pain.  Her pleas for help were shrugged off, she said, and she was repeatedly sent home from the hospital. Doctors and nurses told her she was suffering from normal contractions, she said, even as her abdominal pain worsened and she began to vomit bile. Angelica said she wasn’t taken seriously until a searing pain rocketed throughout her body and her baby’s heart rate plummeted.  Rushed into the operating room for an emergency cesarean section, months before her due date, she nearly died of an undiagnosed case of sepsis.  Even more disheartening: Angelica worked at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, the university affiliated with the hospital that treated her.  WARNING: Some footage may be disturbing. Viewer discretion advised.  WARNING: Some footage may be disturbing - Black women are nearly three times more likely to die during pregnancy or delivery. AP, Angelica Lyons, Ansonia Lyons  Her experience is a reflection of the medical racism, bias and inattentive care that Black Americans endure. Black women have the highest maternal mortality rate in the United States — 69.9 per 100,000 live births for 2021, almost three times the rate for white women, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Black babies are more likely to die, and also far more likely to be born prematurely, setting the stage for health issues that could follow them through their lives.  “Race plays a huge part, especially in the South, in terms of how you’re treated,” Angelica said, and the effects are catastrophic. “People are dying.”  To be Black anywhere in America is to experience higher rates of chronic ailments like asthma, diabetes, high blood pressure, Alzheimer’s and, most recently, COVID-19. Black Americans have less access to adequate medical care; their life expectancy is shorter.  From birth to death, regardless of wealth or social standing, they are far more likely to get sick and die from common ailments.  Black Americans’ health issues have long been ascribed to genetics or behavior, when in actuality, an array of circumstances linked to racism — among them, restrictions on where people could live and historical lack of access to care — play major roles.  Discrimination and bias in hospital settings have been disastrous.  The nation’s health disparities have had a tragic impact: Over the past two decades, the higher mortality rate among Black Americans resulted in 1.6 million excess deaths compared to white Americans. That higher mortality rate resulted in a cumulative loss of more than 80 million years of life due to people dying young and billions of dollars in health care and lost opportunity.  A yearlong Associated Press project found that the health challenges Black Americans endure often begin before their first breath.  The AP conducted dozens of interviews with doctors, medical professionals, advocates, historians and researchers who detailed how a history of racism that began during the foundational years of America led to the disparities seen today.  ___  Angelica Lyons’ pregnancy troubles began during her first trimester, with nausea and severe acid reflux. She was prescribed medication that helped alleviate her symptoms but it also caused severe constipation.  In the last week of October 2019, while she was giving her students a test, her stomach started to hurt badly.  “I remember talking to a couple of my students and they said, ‘You don’t look good, Ms. Lyons,’” Angelica recalled.  She called the University of Alabama-Birmingham Hospital’s labor and delivery unit to tell them she was having a hard time using the bathroom and her stomach was hurting. A woman who answered the phone told her it was a common pregnancy issue, Angelica said, and that she shouldn’t worry too much.  “She made me feel like my concern wasn’t important, and because this was my first pregnancy, I decided not to go because I wasn’t sure and thought maybe I was overreacting,” Angelica said.  The pain persisted. She went to the hospital a few days later and was admitted.  She had an enema — a procedure where fluids are used to cleanse or stimulate the emptying of bowels — to alleviate her constipation, but Angelica continued to plead with them that she was in pain.  “They were like, ‘Oh, it’s nothing, it’s just the Braxton Hicks contractions,’” she said. “They just ignored me.”  She was sent home but her stomach continued to ache, so she went back to the hospital a day later. Several tests, including MRIs, couldn’t find the source of the issue.  Angelica was eventually moved to the labor and delivery floor of the hospital so they could monitor her son’s heartbeat, which had dropped slightly. There, they performed another enema that finally helped with the pain. She also was diagnosed with preeclampsia, a dangerous condition that can cause severe pregnancy complications or death.  Then she began to vomit what appeared to be bile.  “I got worse and worse with the pain and I kept telling them, ‘Hey, I’m in pain,’” Angelica said. “They’d say, ‘Oh, you want some Tylenol?’ But it wasn’t helping.”  She struggled to eat dinner that night. When she stood up to go to the bathroom, she felt a sharp pain ricochet throughout her body.  “I started hollering because I had no idea what was going on,” she said. “I told my sister I was in so much pain and to please call the nurse.”  What happened next remains a blur. Angelica recalls the chaos of hospital staff rushing her to labor and delivery, putting up a blue sheet to prepare her for an emergency C-section as her family and ex-husband tried to understand what went wrong.  She later learned that she nearly died.  “I was on life support,” recalled Angelica, 34. “I coded.”  She woke up three days later, unable to talk because of a ventilator in her mouth. She remembers gesturing wildly to her mother, asking where her son, Malik, was.  He was OK. But Angelica felt so much had been taken from her. She never got to experience those first moments of joy of having her newborn placed on her chest. She didn’t even know what her son looked like.  Maternal sepsis is a leading cause of maternal mortality in America. Black women are twice as likely to develop severe maternal sepsis, as compared to their white counterparts. Common symptoms can include fever or pain in the area of infection. Sepsis can develop quickly, so a timely response is crucial.  Sepsis in its early stages can mirror common pregnancy symptoms, so it can be hard to diagnose. Due to a lack of training, some medical providers don’t know what to look for. But slow or missed diagnoses are also the result of bias, structural racism in medicine and inattentive care that leads to patients, particularly Black women, not being heard.  “The way structural racism can play out in this particular disease is not being taken seriously,” said Dr. Laura Riley, chief of obstetrics and gynecology at Weill Cornell Medicine and New York-Presbyterian Hospital. “We know that delay in diagnosis is what leads to these really bad outcomes.”  In the days and weeks that followed, Angelica demanded explanations from the medical staff of what happened. But she felt the answers she received on how it occurred were sparse and confusing.  A spokesperson for the University of Alabama at Birmingham said in a statement to The Associated Press that they couldn’t talk about Angelica’s case because of patient privacy laws. They pointed to a recent internal survey done by its Obstetrics and Gynecology department that showed that most of its patients are satisfied with their care and “are largely feeling respected,” and said the university and hospital “maintain intentional, proactive efforts in addressing health disparities and maternal mortality.”  Angelica’s son, Malik, was born eight weeks early, weighing under 5 pounds. He spent a month in intensive care. He received home visits through the first year of life to monitor his growth.  While he’s now a curious and vivacious 3-year-old who loves to explore the world around him, Angelica recalls those days in the ICU, and she feels guilty because she could not be with him.  “It’s scary to know I could have died, that we could have died,” Lyons said, wiping away tears. ___  For decades, frustrated birth advocates and medical professionals have tried to sound an alarm about the ways medicine has failed Black women. Historians trace that maltreatment to racist medical practices that Black people endured amid and after slavery.  To fully understand maternal mortality and infant mortality crises for Black women and babies, the nation must first reckon with the dark history of how gynecology began, said Deirdre Cooper Owens, a historian and author.  “The history of this particular medical branch … it begins on a slave farm in Alabama,” Owens said. “The advancement of obstetrics and gynecology had such an intimate relationship with slavery, and was literally built on the wounds of Black women.”  Reproductive surgeries that were experimental at the time, like cesarean sections, were commonly performed on enslaved Black women.  Physicians like the once-heralded J. Marion Sims, an Alabama doctor many call the “father of gynecology,” performed torturous surgical experiments on enslaved Black women in the 1840s without anesthesia.  And well after the abolition of slavery, hospitals performed unnecessary hysterectomies on Black women, and eugenics programs sterilized them.  Health care segregation also played a major role in the racial health gap still experienced today.  Until Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Black families were mostly barred from well-funded white hospitals and often received limited, poor or inhumane medical treatment. Black-led clinics and doctors worked to fill in the gaps, but even after the new protections, hospitals once reserved for Black families remained under-resourced, and Black women didn’t get the same support regularly available for white women.  That history of abuse and neglect led to deep-rooted distrust of health care institutions among communities of color.  “We have to recognize that it’s not about just some racist people or a few bad actors,” said Rana A. Hogarth, an associate professor of History at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. “People need to stop thinking about things like slavery and racism as just these features that happened that are part of the contours of history and maybe think of them more as foundational and institutions that have been with us every step of the way.”  Some health care providers still hold false beliefs about biological differences between Black and white people, such as Black people having “less sensitive nerve endings, thicker skin, and stronger bones.” Those beliefs have caused medical providers today to rate Black patients’ pain lower, and recommend less relief.  The differences exist regardless of education or income level. Black women who have a college education or higher have a pregnancy-related mortality rate that is more than five times higher than that of white women. Notably, the pregnancy-related mortality rate for Black women with a college education is 1.6. times higher than that of white women with less than a high school degree.  In Angelica Lyons’ home state of Alabama, about 40 mothers die within one year after delivery. The toll on Black mothers is disproportionate.  The state’s infant mortality rate for 2021 was 7.6 deaths per 1,000 live births. The disparities between Black and white babies is stark: The infant mortality rate in 2021 for white mothers was 5.8, while the infant mortality rate for Black mothers was 12.1, an increase from 10.9 from the prior year.  Black babies account for just 29% of births in Alabama, yet nearly 47% of infant deaths.  A 2020 report by the Alabama Maternal Mortality Review Committee found that more than 55% of 80 pregnancy-related deaths that they reviewed in 2016 and 2017 could have been prevented.  Alabama launched its Maternal Mortality Review Committee in 2018 to investigate maternal deaths. But Dr. Scott Harris, Alabama’s Department of Public Health State Health Officer, said work remains to collect a fuller picture of why the disparities exist.  “We certainly know that from national numbers as well that Black women have worse maternal outcomes at every income level, which is pretty startling,” said Dr. Harris. “Age matters and just overall ZIP code matters. Unfortunately, where people live, where these children are born, is strongly associated with infant mortality. I think we’ll see something similar for maternal outcomes.”  And concerns about access and barriers to care remain.  In Alabama, 37% of counties are maternity care deserts — more than 240,000 women live in counties with no or little care. About 39% of counties don’t have a single obstetric provider.  Alabama is not alone in this. More than 2.2 million American women of childbearing age live in maternity care deserts, and another 4.8 million such women reside in counties with limited access to maternity care.  Angelica Lyons said she wanted to seek maternal care at another hospital but the University of Alabama was the only one near her home equipped to handle her high-risk pregnancy, which included high blood pressure near the beginning.  Dr. Harris acknowledged the lack of access to care is a barrier for Black women who live in the state’s rural areas. Much of the state’s public health efforts are targeted along the rural Black Belt, which gets its name from the rich soil but it was also a region where many plantations were clustered.  Centuries later, the Black Belt continues to be a high-poverty region with a large Black population. More than half of the nation’s Black population lives in the South.  “We’ve talked a lot about structural racism and the impact of that on African American women and how it has no place in society,” Harris said. “I think we have to publicly call it what it is.”  ___  Angelica Lyons’ traumatic birth experience was not the only one in her family. After two miscarriages, her younger sister, Ansonia, became pregnant in 2020, and it was difficult.  Doctors told her she was suffering from regular morning sickness, though she was vomiting blood.  She was eventually diagnosed with an excessive vomiting disorder, hyperemesis gravidarum, and was extremely dehydrated. Ansonia spent months in and out of the same hospital where her sister had been treated.  “They said, ‘Welcome to the pregnancy, sweetheart. This is what pregnancy is,’” Ansonia, 30, recalled. “I told her, ‘No, this is not normal for me to be throwing up 10 to 20 times a day.’ My own primary care wasn’t listening to me.”  Ansonia said throughout her pregnancy she encountered hospital staff that made stereotypical jokes, calling her child’s father her “baby daddy,” a trope often lobbed at Black parents.  “She said, ‘So, your baby daddy, where does he work?’” Ansonia recalled. “I said, ‘I don’t know what a baby daddy is but the father of my child is at work.’ She asked where he worked and I told her he had two businesses and she acted like she was surprised.”  Ansonia said staff assumed she didn’t have any health insurance, when she had insurance through her employer.  Ansonia has Type 2 diabetes and had issues with her blood pressure and heart throughout the pregnancy. She started to see a cardiologist and by the time she was 21 weeks pregnant, she was diagnosed with congestive heart failure. She was placed on a medley of medications, and her doctors decided to deliver the baby early via C-section.  Ansonia was scared, given everything she witnessed her sister go through nearly two years prior.  “There were several times I told my boyfriend that I thought that I was going to die,” she said.  The C-section went well. Ansonia’s son, Adrien, was due in July 2021 but he was born at the end of May.  He spent his first five days in the intensive care unit, then was hospitalized for another two weeks for some early breathing problems.  Cesarean delivery rates are higher for Black women than white women, 36.8% and 31%, respectively, in 2021.  Problems continued for Ansonia after the delivery. She ended up needing a blood transfusion and was unable to see her son for his first few days of life.  A few months postpartum, she was still vomiting and having fainting spells that led to her being admitted to the hospital off and on. Her arms suffered from bruising from needles used to treat her throughout the pregnancy. She had always been slow to heal from any bruising, a common problem for diabetics.  Yet a doctor who had been involved throughout her entire pregnancy questioned why she had bruises on her arms and asked if she “smoked weed” or took any other recreational drugs. The hospital declined to comment, citing patient privacy laws.  “I said, ‘This is from me being stuck so many times and having to be in the hospital.’ I told him I don’t do any drugs,” she said.  He still sent her blood work off to be tested. The tests came back negative.  “That just made me not trust them, it made me not want to go back,” she said.  ___  There are indications that the sufferings of Black mothers and their babies are being recognized, however late.  In 2019, U.S. Rep. Lauren Underwood, an Illinois Democrat, and Rep. Alma Adams, a North Carolina Democrat, launched the Black Maternal Health Caucus. It is now one of the largest bipartisan congressional caucuses. The caucus introduced the Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act in 2019 and again in 2021, proposing sweeping changes that would increase funding and strengthen oversight. Key parts of the legislation have been adopted but the bill itself has yet to be approved.  President Joe Biden’s budget for fiscal year 2024 includes $471 million in funding to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity rates, expand maternal health initiatives in rural communities, and implicit bias training and other initiatives. It also requires states to provide continuous Medicaid coverage for 12 months postpartum, to eliminate gaps in health insurance. It also includes $1.9 billion in funding for women and child health programs.  U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra told The Associated Press more must be done at all levels of government to root out racism and bias within health care.  “We know that if we provide access to care for mother and baby for a full year, that we probably help produce not just good health results, but a promising future for mom and baby moving forward,” he said.  ___  Shelonda Lyons always taught both her daughters the bitter truth of racism, hoping it would prepare them to navigate life growing up in Birmingham, the Deep South city known for its place in civil rights history.  “When we were young, she was showing us those images of all the Black people being hung, being burned on the trees,” Angelica said, pointing to a book that remains on the family’s coffee table. “She wanted us to understand it, to know where we lived and that racism was something that we might have to deal with.”  But Shelonda never could have prepared for the treatment her daughters endured during their pregnancies. She remembers feeling helpless and angry.  “It’s like a slap in the face to me because at what point do you realize that you’re dealing with human beings? That it doesn’t matter what color they are,” she said, adding that now she worries any time they or her grandsons need to go to the doctor. “I don’t have a lot of trust.”  Angelica underwent two surgeries in the weeks that followed her C-section to repair internal damage and address her infection. She had to wear a colostomy bag for several months until she healed.  More than three years later, her stomach remains disfigured.  “I love my child, I love him all the same but this isn’t the body I was born with,” she said. “This is the body that they caused from them not paying attention to me, not listening to me.”  ___  Kat Stafford, based in Detroit, is a national investigative race writer for the AP’s Race and Ethnicity team.

Rhino gestation is one of the animal kingdom’s longest at around 16 months. A birth is expected around December 2023, with a potential birth window extending into February 2024. The pregnancy was confirmed by the Animal Care and Veterinary Teams using fecal hormone samples in spring 2023.  The calf will be the first southern white rhinoceros ever born at Zoo Atlanta. Only one other rhino calf, an eastern black rhinoceros born in 2013, has been born at the Zoo in the organization’s 134-year history. This will be the first offspring for 12-year-old father Mumbles, who first met Kiazi in early 2022 following her late 2021 arrival from another Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) accredited organization. The calf will not be the first for Kiazi, who gave birth to three previous offspring, one of them stillborn, at other accredited organizations.  “We are thrilled to announce Kiazi’s pregnancy and to be able to look forward to sharing the joy of watching a rhino calf grow with our Members and guests,” said Raymond B. King, President and CEO. “We also hope that the connections our visitors make with this youngster will also inspire conservation action and awareness of the urgent threats facing rhinos in the wild.”  Kiazi, whose name is Swahili for “potato,” was recommended to breed with Mumbles by the AZA White Rhino Species Survival Plan® (SSP), which seeks to maintain healthy, genetically diverse populations of southern white rhinos in accredited zoos.  White rhinos, which are the largest of the five rhino species, are not actually white, despite their name. The moniker is believed to have originated with the Afrikaans word wyd, meaning “wide” – a reference to the shape of white rhinos’ upper lips.  Southern white rhinos are classified as Near Threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). While poaching for their horns is a serious issue for all rhinos and has already resulted in the extinctions and near-extinctions of some species, southern white rhinos are especially vulnerable because they often travel in herds in the wild, a behavior that makes it easier for poachers to locate them. Powdered rhino horn is believed by some cultures to possess medical properties, although rhino horns are made of keratin – the same substance found in human hair and fingernails – and have no known medicinal value.

There is currently no formal midwifery training program in Atlantic Canada. In Nova Scotia, the province funds 16 positions, but it hasn't been able to fill two temporary positions. The president for the Association of Nova Scotia Midwives told the standing committee on community services it's because all the midwives in Nova Scotia are employed.  ""There's around 2,000 midwives working across Canada, so there's not necessarily a lack of midwives in the country,"" Jessica MacDonald told the committee on Tuesday. ""Obviously we'd love to see that number grow, but really it's the Atlantic region that's suffering because we don't have education opportunities here.""  Midwives provide primary care to families throughout pregnancy, labour, birth and the postpartum and newborn period. In 2021, MacDonald said only five per cent of births in Nova Scotia were midwife-led, ""which is significantly lower than other jurisdictions across Canada."" MacDonald said midwives attend 20 to 25 per cent of births in B.C. and Ontario.  MacDonald said the top reason for admission to hospital in Nova Scotia is birth. She said an economic evaluation of midwifery in Nova Scotia in 2018 concluded the field ""represents value for money when compared to maternity-related services provided by family physicians.""  Despite the overwhelming demand for care, approximately half of individuals who request midwife care do not have access due to the lack of government investment in the profession, MacDonald said.  Lindsay Peach, the executive director of Tajikeimɨk, an organization that helps Mi'kmaw communities create and deliver their own health and wellness programs, urged the province to set up a school to train midwives in Nova Scotia.  Reviving Mi'kmaw birth practices  Peach said anyone who currently wants to be a midwife must leave the province to train.  ""As a result, there are only two Mi'kmaw midwives, neither of them are currently practising midwifery in Nova Scotia,"" Peach said. ""Providing women and babies with Indigenous midwives is an act of reconciliation. We need to revive Mi'kmaw birth practices now or they could be lost by future generations.""  Tanya Penney, the senior executive director of Nova Scotia's Department of Health and Wellness, told the committee that in October 2022, Nova Scotia signed on with the other Atlantic provinces to conduct a feasibility study for a ""midwifery educational institution in the Maritimes.""  Penney said she hopes ""that work will be done relatively soon. Newfoundland is leading the work and Nova Scotia, P.E.I. and New Brunswick are supporting it.""

This was not a decision that my husband and I had discussed beforehand, and I was caught completely off guard. I did not want her there.  To make matters worse, my husband did not stick up for me when I expressed my discomfort and asked for his mother to leave the room. He simply brushed off my concerns and said that his mother was excited to be a part of the experience.

Further, you need to establish with him boundaries around how others, including his mother, can enter your space.  Yes, that may seem extreme, but it is true. It is challenging and amazing to be a new mom and to learn so many things about caring for your baby. You need the people closest to you to be in alignment with your needs and desires.

He is a proud man, but he is also an aging man. I want to help him with this necessary chore. How can I do so without hurting his pride?  — Empty the Trash  DEAR EMPTY THE TRASH: You can go to him directly and offer to handle his trash for him weekly.  Tell him you have noticed that sometimes the cans aren’t secure. Ask him if you can help make sure everything is set and safe for your cans — and his.

The investigators then assessed the primary outcomes of necrotizing enterocolitis, in-hospital mortality, and sepsis, which was defined as a bacterial or fungal infection occurring after 3 days of birth.  Investigators compared the changes in outcomes for infants with very low birth weight at NICUs before and after hospital-level adoption of probiotics to NICUs that did not adopt probiotic use. An additional analysis was used for the proportion of neonates that were treated with probiotics in each birth year and NICU.  The study data included 307,905 neonates with very low birth weight at 807 hospitals within the United States. In NICUs that adopted hospital-level probiotic use, the rate of probiotic treatment increased from 4.1% in 2012 to 12.6% in 2019.  Investigators found that the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis declined by approximately 18% at adopting NICUs compared to the trends at nonadopting hospitals.  Additionally, only 16.5% of NICUs adopted probiotics by 2019, with 76.3% receiving probiotics in 2019 at NICUs. Investigators reported that probiotic adoption rates were higher in the West region and lower in the Northeast. For newly adopting NICUs, there was a mean of 3.6 pre-period years and 4.1 post-period years. For those that did not adopt it, there was a mean of 7.8 years.  However, investigators found that probiotic use was not associated with a significant reduction in sepsis or mortality. They also found similar results when excluding NICUs that had already achieved 20% adoption of probiotics by 2012.  The results were also confirmed with an analysis of NICUs that had a 10% probiotic use threshold to define adoption. Additionally, the benefits were smaller than originally predicted by the totality of randomized controlled trial evidence but were consistent with a meta-analysis of studies with a low risk of bias.  Investigators cited limitations with the study, such as it being an observational study. They also noted that a difference-in-differences approach does not rely on comparison at an individual level for those who were treated and untreated in the same NICU during the same year.  Furthermore, investigators were not able to identify a reason for a gap between efficacy of probiotics in clinical trials compared with probiotics in practice in this setting.

While lots of expectant parents enjoy thicker, fuller tresses, people who’ve recently given birth often find their locks start shedding.  Scroll to continue with content Ad ADVERTISEMENT  This can cause some to feel insecure and unsure of how to return their hair to its former glory.  So, when hair health specialists at Harklinikken explained exactly why this happens and what new mums can do about it, you’d best believe my ears pricked up. Here’s what I learned.  Why does postpartum hair loss happen?  Postpartum hair loss is typically caused by hormonal changes.  “During pregnancy, oestrogen levels are much higher. This hormone keeps hair in its anagen, or growth, phase for longer, and fewer hairs reach the telogen phase, which is when shedding occurs,” the hair experts explain.  They add that “around three months after the baby is born, or after you stop  breastfeeding, the sudden hormone drop initiates the hair shedding that didn’t occur during pregnancy, and you can lose around four times as many hairs each day”.  In other words, your scalp is essentially hoarding your hair during your pregnancy – only to release the excess strands in one go after birth. Oh great.  Of course, “stress is another signiﬁcant factor”, say experts – and there’s plenty of that after the birth of a baby.  “From diﬃcult deliveries to sleep deprivation, a new baby can take its toll – and that stress can aﬀect your hair.”  What can I do about it?  First of all, you might not need to do anything. Postpartum hair loss should ease over time. The American Academy of Dermatology Association says that by their child’s first birthday, most women regain their normal hair growth.  But if you want to prevent and speed up the process, Harklinikken recommends taking the following steps:  1. Eat well  It might seem obvious, but your diet has a huge impact on your hair. So, say hair care experts, “eating foods rich in protein will ensure your hair stays strong and healthy”.  They recommend incorporating foods like chicken, beef, ﬁsh, green vegetables, eggs, walnuts, beans and sweet potatoes into your diet.  2. Stay hydrated  It feels like everyone is telling us to drink more water lately, but Harklinikken reckons the hyper-hydrated influencers of the world are onto something.  “When you don’t drink enough, your body will use the water you do drink for more important functions than your hair, causing it to become dry and brittle, and can slow or even stop hair growth,” they say.  3. Give the Trunchbull bun a rest  I have a fringe, a sweaty forehead, and more strays and flyaways than I know what to do with, so I understand the urge to slick your hair back in a tight bun.  However, experts advises against achieving that scraped-back chic look while you’re suffering from postpartum hair loss.  “Hairstyles that are too tight are strenuous on your hair and can increase hair loss, so be gentle when styling your hair and avoid putting in a tight ponytail,” they say.  4. Don’t skimp on the shampoo  Ah, finally – my usually inexcusable £10 shampoo habit has been justified. The hair care brand advises that a pricier product is sometimes worth the splurge, especially if it adds volume.  Story continues  And they state that cheaper options can “contain drying chemicals, like alcohol denat, ethanol, and benzyl alcohol”.  If you’re struggling with hair loss, you might want to give the heat stylers a break too, they say, as these “can cause breakage and further hair loss”.  5. Indulge your scalp  Need some ‘you’ time after birth? So does your scalp, apparently.  “A scalp massage can help stimulate blood ﬂow and encourage new hair growth,” say the hair health pros.  They suggest “apply(ing) ﬁrm but gentle pressure in circular motions when washing your hair, and brushing the scalp every night with a natural bristle brush” to “increase the blood circulation”.  Well, if they insist...  6. If you’re worried about long-standing hair loss, see a doctor  While postpartum hair loss is normal, it might be worth reaching out to your doctor if the symptoms continue. After all, there are many reasons why hair loss can occur.  “If the hair loss is severe, with hair coming out in clumps, or you’ve been losing hair for longer than six months, it might be a good idea to consult your doctor,” says Harklinikken.  They add that “some thyroid conditions are linked to pregnancy, and an overactive thyroid could be causing your hair loss – or it could be an iron deﬁciency”.  If you’re panicking about regular postpartum hair loss, though, you can relax.  “Postpartum hair loss is very common,” says Harklinikken – so, eat and drink well, treat your scalp like a princess, and wait a little while. Your hair woes should end soon.

But if you’re pregnant, it’s wise to question what is safe. While many allergy medications and certain pain medications are safe during pregnancy, some should be avoided.  If you’ve dealt with allergies before, your medicine cabinet may be full of options. But while pregnant, your obstetrician is your best health advisor. Keep the discussion open and ask for their advice before taking new medications.  Do allergies affect pregnancy or get worse when pregnant?  Besides being uncomfortable, allergies don’t affect pregnancy in worrisome ways. However, allergies may get slightly worse when pregnant.  “Most of the increase in symptoms is actually due to inflammation of the mucus membranes, like in the nasal passageways,” says Nebraska Medicine obstetrician Karen Carlson, MD. “Many women will also mouth breathe during pregnancy, which can cause dryness that can increase symptoms of allergies.  Allergy medications in the first trimester  Try to avoid any medications that are not necessary during the first trimester. While some antihistamines are OK, avoid decongestants for at least the first trimester.  “One of the medications we particularly like to avoid is pseudoephedrine (Sudafed®), which is a decongestant,” adds Dr. Carlson. “It has been possibly related to some birth defects when used in the first trimester. Additionally, it can cause an increase in blood pressure, so it is not my favorite medication for use during pregnancy.”  Allergies and pregnancy, what can I take?  Many over-the-counter allergy medications are safe during pregnancy, but there are some to avoid. Certain antihistamines may also contain decongestants (see above). Be sure to read the product labels. Look for the letter “D” at the end of the brand name to spot those containing decongestants, or you might notice words like “congestion relief” on the package.  Consider trying a nonmedication solution first to see if it works for you.  Nonmedication remedies:  Avoid triggers by limiting your exposure to them  Saline nasal drops or spray  Warm salt water gargle  Nasal sinus rinse (like a neti pot). Use bottled water that has been distilled or sterilized  Shower after coming in from outside. A warm shower can also help to open up your airways  Avoid opening windows if the allergen counts are high  Exercise may help reduce nasal inflammation  Nasal strips or elevating the head of your bed (30 to 45 degrees)  A humidifier can help moisten the air and may soothe nasal passages  Safe OTC medications:  Diphenhydramine (Benadryl®)  Loratidine (Claritin®)  Cetirizine (Zyrtec®)  Nasal steroid (Flonase®)  Guaifenesin (plain Mucinex®)  Mentholated cream (Vicks Vapor Rub®)  Afrin® may be used, but only for a short time (three days or less)  Be advised: Do not take the sustained action (SA) or the multi-symptom form of these drugs.  Talk with your doctor if OTC medications don’t help. A course of oral steroids may be considered if absolutely necessary.  What about new allergies or allergy shots during pregnancy?  New allergies can be treated with the above-mentioned medications, but allergy shots may be another matter to discuss with your doctor. “It is not recommended to start a new program of allergy shots for desensitization during pregnancy,” advises Dr. Carlson. “If a patient is already doing them, they can be continued, but usually without increasing the dose of allergens given until after pregnancy.”  You can take comfort in knowing your allergies won’t affect a healthy pregnancy, but how you treat the symptoms matter – team up with your doctor to choose what is best for your health and situation.

He was one of the key organisers of the Ghadar Mutiny and founded the First Indian National Army during World War 2 based on the militarization policy of Vinayak Damodar Savarkar.  He founded the Japanese branch of the Hindu Mahasabha in 1938 under the inspiration of Vinayak Damodar Savarkar who was the president of Hindu Mahasabha, India.  The Indian National Army (INA) was formed in 1942 under Rash Behari Bose which he later handed over as the Indian National Army to Subhas Chandra Bose. Rash Behari Bose remained the Supreme Advisor of INA led by Subhash Chandra Bose.  About Rash Behari Bose, his early life and revolutionary career  Rash Behari Bose was born on 25 May 1886 in a Bengali Kayastha family. He was born in his native village named Subaldaha situated in Purba Bardhaman district, West Bengal, India.  Revolutionary leader Rash Behari Bose played a key role in India’s struggle for Independence.  He died on 21 January 1945 in Tokyo, Japan of tuberculosis.  He was interested in revolutionary activities from early on in his life, he left Bengal to shun the Alipore bomb case trials in (1908). At Dehradun, he worked as a head clerk at the Forest Research Institute.  He secretly got involved with the revolutionaries of Bengal and came across eminent revolutionary members of the Arya Samaj in the United Provinces (currently Uttar Pradesh) and Punjab.  Bose played a key role in the Delhi Conspiracy Case (attempted assassination of the British Viceroy, Lord Hardinge), the Banaras Conspiracy Case and the Ghadr Conspiracy at Lahore.  On December 23, 1912, a bomb was thrown at Lord Hardinge during a ceremonial procession of transferring the capital from Calcutta to New Delhi. Bose was the mastermind behind the attack.

While some Austrians advocate for the demolition of the house to prevent it from becoming a gathering place for neo-Nazis, critics argue that such an action would amount to denying Austria's past. Alternatives proposed by various groups include using the house as a site of reconciliation or as the headquarters for a charitable organisation.  Construction work to transform the house is anticipated to commence in the autumn, with the completion of the project expected by 2025. According to Austrian broadcaster ORF, the police force is set to occupy the renovated premises by the following year.  During the Nazi regime, the house was turned into a shrine dedicated to Hitler, attracting numerous tourists to the town. However, as the Nazis began losing control in 1944, the building was boarded up. To discourage far-right tourism, the Austrian government had rented the house from its previous owner, Gerlinde Pommer, who had operated it as a daycare centre for individuals with special needs. However, future renovations were halted when Pommer objected.  In 2016, the government enacted a law that allowed for the seizure of property from Pommer in exchange for compensation amounting to over €800,000 (£694,000). Three years later, the interior ministry announced its plans to repurpose the 17th-century house into a police station and training facility.  Austria, which was annexed by Nazi Germany in 1938, had long portrayed itself as a victim of the regime. However, the country has increasingly acknowledged its complicity in Nazi crimes, prompting discussions about its complex history. The decision to repurpose Hitler's birth house reflects Austria's commitment to confronting its past while utilising the site to educate law enforcement officials on the importance of human rights.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdlby50di9sYXRlc3QvNDg5MDExLWhpdGxlci1iaXJ0aC1ob3VzZS1pbi1hdXN0cmlhLXRyYW5zZm9ybWVkLWludG8taHVtYW4tcmlnaHRzLXRyYWluaW5nLWNlbnRlci1mb3ItcG9saWNl0gF0aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2VvLnR2L2FtcC80ODkwMTEtaGl0bGVyLWJpcnRoLWhvdXNlLWluLWF1c3RyaWEtdHJhbnNmb3JtZWQtaW50by1odW1hbi1yaWdodHMtdHJhaW5pbmctY2VudGVyLWZvci1wb2xpY2U?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

By Sophie Hirsh May 23 2023, Published 1:24 p.m. ET Source: iStock  Being pregnant and giving birth are some of the most incredible human experiences — but they are also known for being pretty painful, both physically and emotionally. So, in pursuit of easing stress and providing support during pregnancy and birth, many parents-to-be hire doulas.  Article continues below advertisement  If you are considering hiring a doula, the pressure of choosing the right one for you can be overwhelming. So, we spoke with a few incredible birthing professionals to learn about some questions to ask a doula during the interview process, as well as their recommendations on how to find a local (and affordable) doula near you, red flags to look out for, and the benefits of using a doula.  Source: iStock  Article continues below advertisement  These questions to ask a doula can help during the interview process.  Stacey Blackwell is a birth and postpartum doula and documentary photographer. She provides her services through her Los Angeles-based company Modern LA Doula.  Via email, Blackwell shares with Green Matters the top three questions she recommends asking a prospective doula: What is your “why,” your mission — aka, what fuels your work and passion? How do you handle creating an alliance with the birth team? (Home or hospital birth applicable.) How would you best describe your doula style?  Article continues below advertisement  Rachel André is a Brooklyn-based certified birth and postpartum doula, as well as an integrative lactation and feeding specialist. She has a variety of certifications, and through her company, she offers her services to people all across the New York City area.  Article continues below advertisement  The three questions André recommends asking doulas during interviews are: What brought you to their work and what is your philosophy on supporting parents? What is your ideal client? How long have you been doing this work and what training have you received? And, see if they use inclusive language.

The New Orleans-based agency trains people all across the U.S. (as well as in several international countries), and is one of the largest online Black doula training agencies. Sista Midwife Productions also runs the online Black Doula Directory in partnership with Baby Dove.  Deggins shares the three questions she thinks expecting parents should ask a potential doula: What is your philosophy around pregnancy, labor, and birth? This is helpful to ensure they are aligned with your personal outlook and are willing to be in lockstep with you throughout the birthing process. What other specialties or experience do you have? Most families should get background insights on what the potential doula specializes in and the level of their previous experience. How will they help in creating an empowering birth experience? This is a good question to help better understand the doula’s approach to centering the family, their needs, and allowing them to ultimately have autonomy over their experience.  Article continues below advertisement  Source: Sista Midwife Productions Nicole Deggins, founder of Sista Midwife Productions  To avoid hiring a bad doula, look out for these red flags.  Like with pretty much anything on Earth, doulas can provide either a positive or a negative experience for their client — so it’s important to be aware of potential red flags.  Article continues below advertisement  According to Blackwell, these are important red flags to look out for when speaking with potential doulas: Someone who lacks conversation skills. Someone with very few boundaries and/or a disorganized business. Someone with a lack of passion for this work. “Burnout is real in birth work, so the work should come from a huge calling within first and foremost, not just a ‘job.’”  André adds these red flags: Someone who doesn’t ask questions back or find a way to involve your partner (if applicable). Saying yes to everything you want without followup. Someone who gives you a bad gut feeling after the interview. “Your gut and intuition can tell you a lot about the person and it's important to listen to and trust those feelings.”  Article continues below advertisement  And Deggins shares these warning signs to look out for: Someone who presents themselves as the only necessary provider for your pregnancy or birth. “Your doula should be seen as one part of your birth team. Your birth team will also include a midwife or physician.” Someone who is giving actual medical advice, diagnosing, or prescribing medication. “Doulas are not medical providers.” Someone who is not in alignment with your personal birth preferences. Someone who gives you a bad gut feeling. “As with all things pregnancy and birth, if something feels ‘off’ you should listen to your intuition and seek out another doula.”  Source: Midwives of New Jersey Rachel André assists in a birth.  Article continues below advertisement  Here’s how to find a doula near you.  When looking for a doula near you, there are many directories online that can help you get started.  Deggins recommends Sista Midwife Productions and Baby Dove’s Black Doula Directory, and Blackwell recommends the websites Pregnancy Pathways and DoulaMatch. Meanwhile, André recommends asking friends, family, and even people in Facebook parenting groups for personal doula recommendations.  Article continues below advertisement  Source: Sista Midwife Productions Nicole Deggins presents the Black Doula Directory.  Here’s how to find affordable doulas near you.  Blackwell notes that many doulas take clients at a sliding scale upon request, as well as a few pro-bono clients each year — so, she recommends reaching out to that “dream doula you've been following for years.” She also advises starting a Doula Fund on Babylist, so friends and family can contribute funds to help you hire a doula, perhaps instead of a baby gift registry.  Article continues below advertisement  If you are open to hiring a doula-in-training (they are typically more affordable), André advises checking out the websites CAPPA and DONA. She adds that finding a doula independently of an agency is typically more affordable, and more likely to offer a sliding scale rate.  You might be able to use your HSA/FSA to pay your doula; furthermore, most states cover doulas for people with Medicaid, André notes. So make sure to check if your insurance covers doula services; if not, your insurance may cover “maternity care bundles” that include doulas, as per Wildwood Birth Collective — so make sure to do your research.  Article continues below advertisement  Source: iStock  There are so many reasons to hire a doula.  Unsurprisingly, the three experts can all easily wax poetic about the benefits of hiring a doula. “We know doulas are important and beneficial,” says Deggins. “Research shows us they improve birth outcomes for moms and babies, they decrease the use of unnecessary interventions, decrease cesarean section rates, and families who use doulas report more satisfaction with their birth when compared to those who don’t use doulas.”  Article continues below advertisement  Additionally, “doulas create a safe space for moms and families to feel seen, supported, and heard,” Deggins adds. “They are often the advocate for the mothers while everyone else is focused on the baby. They are an unbiased listening ear.” Blackwell explains that hiring a doula can provide “continuity of care through the full journey,” as well as “evidence-based advice,” and “unbiased important conversations.”  She also notes that doulas can help encourage partners on the best ways “to support and show up” for their birthing partner. Additionally, doulas can help build community with local pregnant people and new parents, by connecting like-minded families.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyZWVubWF0dGVycy5jb20vcGFyZW50aW5nL3F1ZXN0aW9ucy10by1hc2stYS1kb3VsYdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Rafa's Roland Garros journey started on this day in 2005, with an 18-year-old playing his first match in Paris against Lars Burgsmuller. It was Nadal's first encounter as a top-5 player, and he made it memorable. The young Spaniard beat the German 6-1, 7-6, 6-1 in an hour and 45 minutes in rainy conditions.  Rafa was among the favorites after winning Monte Carlo, Barcelona and Rome. A teenager played well in his first match, dropping 16 points in 14 service games and never facing a break point. The pressure was on Burgsmuller, and he dealt with it only in the second set.  Rafael Nadal scored his first Roland Garros victory over Lars Burgsmuller in 2005.  World no. 96 could not match the rival's pace behind the initial shot. Lars stayed in touch in set number two but got broken four times in sets one and three to propel the youngster over the finish line.  Rafa completed his first Roland Garros game with a forehand crosscourt winner and earned a break in game four to forge the advantage. Nadal cemented it with an ace down the T line in the next one for 4-1, settling into a fine rhythm.  Burgsmuller suffered another break in game six and allowed Nadal to clinch the opener with a service winner a few minutes later after 31 minutes. The German found his shots in set number two, playing aggressive tennis and keeping his service games safe until the tie break.  The Spaniard stayed calm and claimed it 7-4 to extend his lead and gather an even more significant boost ahead of set number three. Rafa forced Lars' error in the second game thanks to a deep return. The Spaniard landed a backhand down the line winner to move 3-0 up and closer to the finish line.  The German sprayed another backhand error in the fourth game to give serve away, drawing further away from the positive score. Rafa served for the victory at 5-1, eager to finish the job before a possible rain delay. Nadal fired three winners in the seventh game to emerge at the top, introducing himself to the Parisian crowd and starting a journey toward his first Roland Garros crown.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50ZW5uaXN3b3JsZHVzYS5vcmcvdGVubmlzL25ld3MvUmFmYWVsX05hZGFsLzEzMzAyNS90aGUtYmlydGgtb2YtYS1jaGFtcGlvbi1yYWZhZWwtbmFkYWwtcy1pY29uaWMtZGVidXQtYXQtcm9sYW5kLWdhcnJvcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"birth","0540-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Ottawa"", ""Ontario"", ""Canada""}","2023-05-24T01:29:00","A new study suggests nearly twice as many pregnant women are being hospitalized due to cannabis use since pot was legalized in Canada. Though numbers are low, it's still raising concerns.  Researchers behind a new study suggesting an increase in hospital visits by pregnant people related to cannabis use say they're concerned about the potential risks, including premature births and low birth weights.  The research paper, published Monday in the Canadian Medical Association Journal , tracked data from close to one million pregnancies in Ontario between January 2015 and July 2021.  A new study shows a small increase in emergency room visits and hospitalizations related to cannabis use by pregnant people. (Serhii Bobyk/Shutterstock)  Of those, a small fraction — 540 pregnant people — visited an emergency room or were hospitalized for cannabis use, according to health administrative data compiled by the researchers. Most of those cases, 390, were emergency room visits.  But the rate of acute care hospital visits rose after cannabis was legalized for recreational use in October 2018, from 11 out of every 100,000 pregnancies to 20 per 100,000, the study says.  The lead author, family physician and public health researcher Dr. Daniel Myran, said that while these incidents are rare, they are also serious, and the rising rate is particularly worrying.  ""The concern that I have is, these are very severe presentations, and does the increase in these severe presentations represent a much larger increase in general cannabis use during pregnancy?"" he told CBC News.  The study notes the most common reason for needing emergency care related to cannabis was harmful substance use, according to the codes used by hospital staff. That was followed by cannabis dependence or withdrawal, and acute intoxication.  Myran, a fellow at the Bruyère Research Institute and The Ottawa Hospital, said the babies born to these patients were more likely to have lower birth weights, premature births or require admission to a neonatal intensive care unit.  ""Given the unknown risks of cannabis at this time, the safest course of action is to not use cannabis during pregnancy,"" he said.  'We don't have the answers yet'  But other researchers caution that more evidence is needed before making any broad recommendations.  The study suggests the biggest risk factor for cannabis use during pregnancy was severe morning sickness, and Myran said women might be self-medicating to relieve their nausea.  Marlena Fejzo, a researcher at the University of Southern California, pointed out that severe forms of nausea and vomiting can also lead to low birth weights and premature births, making it unclear whether cannabis use or an underlying health condition is responsible for the negative outcomes in the Ontario study.  Fejzo is also the science advisor of the Hyperemesis Education and Research Foundation, a non-profit that focuses on a condition of extreme nausea and persistent vomiting called hyperemesis gravidarum, experienced in about one per cent of pregnancies.  ""We don't have the answers yet as to whether it's safer to take cannabis than to leave your hyperemesis untreated in pregnancy,"" she said.  The most common risk factor for pregnant people who used cannabis was severe morning sickness, according to a new study. (David Donnelly/CBC)  She experienced the debilitating condition during pregnancy, and said she was so sick she was unable to eat or drink.  Her research, conducted in the U.S., shows that many pregnant people have reported using cannabis because other treatments aren't effective for their nausea and vomiting. They say cannabis is the only thing that allows them to eat.  ""People are taking cannabis, so you can't just ignore that fact,"" Fejzo said. ""They deserve answers as to the safety of cannabis use in pregnancy.""  'Left in the lurch'  Dr. Dominique Morisano, an adjunct professor in public health at the University of Toronto, added that people dealing with mental health concerns during pregnancy may also turn to cannabis to self-medicate.  ""A lot of women are left in the lurch during and after pregnancy in terms of their mental health care,"" she said.  Hormonal swings and the major life changes that can come with a baby can bring new psychological challenges, meanwhile some — but not all — pharmaceutical drugs are off limits during pregnancy and therapy is expensive, Morisano pointed out.  ""We should be doing better for pregnant women and postpartum care in our society,"" she said.  ""If we don't, people are going to look for their own ways to take care of themselves.""  According to Health Canada , the safest option is to stop using cannabis during pregnancy. The federal agency recommends that medicinal cannabis users speak to their doctors about safer alternatives.  The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada says there is strong evidence that cannabis use during pregnancy poses risk of lifelong harm to a developing fetus related to memory function, hyperactive behaviour, anxiety and depression.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL2hlYWx0aC9jYW5uYWJpcy1wcmVnbmFuY3ktc3R1ZHktMS42ODUxOTg1P2NtcD1yc3PSASBodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYmMuY2EvYW1wLzEuNjg1MTk4NQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"birth","2023-02-07","Not Discerned","{""Washington"", ""DistrictOfColumbia"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T11:25:59","Hristio Boytchev The BMJ  Whether Pfizer’s maternal respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine candidate increases the risk of preterm birth dominated discussions at a meeting last week of the committee advising the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).1 While all members of the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) voted positively on efficacy, four out of 14 voted that the data were not adequate to support safety.  As The BMJ revealed earlier this month,2 Pfizer’s clinical trials showed increased levels of preterm births among vaccinated women, and GSK, which was working on a similar vaccine, halted vaccination in its phase 3 trials after observing an increase in neonatal deaths and preterm births.34  Paul Offit, professor of paediatrics at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and VRBPAC member who voted “no” on safety, said at the meeting that he had “no problem” with efficacy. On safety, however, “the GSK experience” troubled him.5 “If preterm births are in any way a consequence of this vaccine it would be tragic.”  In Pfizer’s phase 2 trial, there were three preterm births (2.6%) in the placebo group v six (5.3%) in the vaccine group. In the phase 3 trial, which studied preterm births as an “adverse event of special interest,” 5.7% of babies were born preterm among vaccinated women v 4.7% in the placebo group. There was also an imbalance in babies with low birth weight (5.1% in the vaccine group v 4.4% in the placebo group).6 None of the differences were statistically significant.  The discussion around efficacy was largely positive. In the phase 3 trial, six infants of mothers in the vaccine group (0.2%) developed severe RSV associated lower respiratory tract disease within 90 days after birth compared with 33 (0.9%) in the placebo group, resulting in an estimated 81.8% efficacy.  Limitations discussed included reduced protection after six months and the finding that vaccinations did not significantly lower respiratory tract disease overall, which Pfizer said was because RSV was not the dominant respiratory disease during the pandemic. RSV is normally considered the leading cause of infant hospital admissions in the US.  According to Pfizer, the increase in preterm births was most pronounced in trial sites from upper middle income countries, particularly South Africa,7 a result similar to GSK, which observed an imbalance in lower and middle income countries. Stephen Evans, emeritus professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told The BMJ, “I’d like to understand what’s happening in South Africa.”  Evans said ahead of the meeting that he was disappointed in the FDA analysis of the data showing precise continuous measures such as mean gestational age and birth weight of the infants born in the trial, citing the agency’s unique opportunity to demand data. After a committee request, Pfizer displayed a chart showing no difference in mean birth weights between the vaccine and placebo groups,8 a “definite reassurance,” according to Evans.  Other reassuring aspects mentioned by experts were the finding that preterm births did not immediately follow vaccination and that most were late preterm births.  On the other hand, committee members raised concerns about data from non-pregnant people indicating that when given together, the RSV vaccine reduced the immunogenicity of influenza and the tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (Tdap) vaccine, which are recommended for pregnant women.9  Overall, there was unease regarding safety, with demands for more complete data and an FDA enforced post-marketing requirement to conduct “aggressive” surveillance following approval.  “We should be raising the bar higher,” said Amanda Cohn, director of the Division of Birth Defects and Infant Disorders at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who voted “yes” on safety. She noted that much larger vaccine studies had been conducted to root out safety problems and these should have been done for a vaccine involving pregnant women to provide them with the information they need to decide on vaccination.  Hana El Sahly, professor of virology at Baylor College of Medicine and committee chairwoman, voted “no” on safety. “The signal is significant in phase 2, in phase 3, and in a very similar product,” she said. Failing to design the phase 3 study to deliver clarity on the matter was a “big missed opportunity,” said El Sahly, adding, “It’s unfair that we kick the can down the road to the larger public.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiKWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJtai5jb20vY29udGVudC8zODEvYm1qLnAxMTg30gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

You can read the original story here.  Years before the Bamberg County Hospital closed in 2012, and the next-closest hospital in neighboring Barnwell shut its doors in 2016, those facilities had stopped delivering babies.  These days, there’s not even an ultrasound machine in this rural county 60 miles south of Columbia, much less an obstetrician. Pregnant women here are left with few options for care.  Federally qualified health centers offer prenatal services in nearby Fairfax and Barnwell, but only when a pregnancy is uncomplicated and only through about 34 weeks of gestation.  During the final weeks of pregnancy, women must transfer their care to the nearest obstetrician, often in Orangeburg, which can be 20 miles away or more, depending on where they live in Bamberg County. Some women travel farther to hospitals in Aiken or Beaufort, where health outcomes are better.  “Most of our women are driving an hour or more from their homes to an OB provider,” said Tracy Golden, a doula and senior program manager for the South Carolina Office of Rural Health.  Although the regional hospital in the city of Orangeburg delivers babies, the birth outcomes in the county are awful by any standard. In 2021, nearly 3% of all Black infants in Orangeburg County died before their 1st birthday.  Nationally, the average is about 1% for Black infants and less than 0.5% for white infants.  Meanwhile, Orangeburg County’s infant mortality rate for babies of all races is the highest in South Carolina, according to the latest data published by the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control.  By 2030, the federal government wants infant mortality to fall to 5 or fewer deaths per 1,000 live births. According to annual data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 16 states have already met or surpassed that goal, including Nevada, New York, and California. But none of those states are in the South, where infant mortality is by far the highest in the country, with Mississippi’s rate of 8.12 deaths per 1,000 live births ranking worst.  Even in those few Southern states where infant mortality rates are inching closer to the national average, the gap between death rates of Black and white babies is vast. In Florida and North Carolina, for example, the Black infant mortality rate is more than twice as high as it is for white babies. A new study published in JAMA found that over two decades Black people in the U.S. experienced more than 1.6 million excess deaths and 80 million years of life lost because of increased mortality risk relative to white Americans. The study also found that infants and older Black Americans bear the brunt of excess deaths and years lost.  That makes Black infant mortality in the South a complex regional crisis that should alarm everyone, not just future parents, said Georgina Dukes-Harris, senior director for social care at Unite Us, a national technology company focused on societal needs. Birth outcomes for mothers and infants are a leading indicator of population well-being and they run much deeper than health care: They reflect politics. They’re a direct product of generational poverty and racism. They reveal our priorities, Dukes-Harris said.  Often, babies die under circumstances that states, communities, and parents can help control, like making sure infants don’t suffocate in beds or in unsafe cribs, or extending health coverage so that young women can afford to see a doctor before they become pregnant. In many of these respects, the South is failing.  “This is something that has to change,” Dukes-Harris said.  ‘An Urgent Problem’ With No Easy Solution  Public health officials are still trying to parse the long-term impact of the covid-19 pandemic, but infant death rates in South Carolina were higher than the national average long before the health care landscape changed in 2020. And a report published by the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control in April shows the rate for non-Hispanic Black babies — who died at a rate nearly 2½ times that of non-Hispanic white infants in South Carolina in 2021 — is growing worse. The death rate among infants born to Black mothers in the state increased by nearly 40% from 2017 to 2021.  “That’s just not acceptable,” said Edward Simmer, director of the South Carolina health department. “It’s absolutely an urgent problem to me.”  It’s a problem, though, without an apparent solution. Multimillion-dollar programs to improve South Carolina’s numbers over the past decade have failed to move the needle. To make things more complicated, separate state agencies have reached different conclusions about the leading cause of infant death.  The state Department of Health and Human Services — which administers Medicaid, the health coverage program for low-income residents, and pays for more than half of all births in South Carolina — claims accidental deaths were the No. 1 reason babies covered by Medicaid died from 2016 to 2020, according to Medicaid spokesperson Jeff Leieritz.  But the state health department, where all infant death data is housed, reported birth defects as the top cause for the past several years. Accidental deaths ranked fifth among all causes in 2021, according to the 2021 health department report. All but one of those accidental infant deaths were attributed to suffocation or strangulation in bed.  Meanwhile, infant mortality is a topic that continues to get little, if any, attention, especially in the South.  A group called the South Carolina Birth Outcomes Initiative meets regularly to talk strategy, but this consortium of the state’s top doctors, nurses, health insurers, and hospital leaders can’t solve fundamental problems, like teaching parents safe sleep habits or connecting all pregnant women to basic prenatal care. According to the Medicaid agency, nearly half of Medicaid-enrolled babies who died before their 1st birthday in 2021 were born to mothers who received no prenatal care.  “There’s good work going on. It’s just in little patches. It’s just not spread out enough to change our overall numbers,” said Rick Foster, a retired physician and former chairman of one of the Birth Outcomes Initiative’s working groups.  Expanding Access to Maternal Care  South Carolina and several other states recently extended postpartum Medicaid coverage for women who give birth, which means their coverage remains in place for one year after delivery. Historically, Medicaid coverage was cut off 60 days after having a baby.  Some experts believe expanding Medicaid coverage to single, working adults who aren’t pregnant and don’t have children — something most Southern states have failed to do — would also help curtail infant deaths. A woman who is healthy when heading into pregnancy is more likely to give birth to a healthy baby because the health of the mother correlates to the health of the infant. But many women don’t qualify for Medicaid coverage until they become pregnant.  Even when they become pregnant and are newly eligible for Medicaid, it isn’t unusual for women in South Carolina to put off seeing a doctor until the third trimester, physicians told KFF Health News. These women can’t afford to take time off work, can’t find child care, or don’t have a car, among other reasons.  Telehealth could improve access if the state’s broadband network were better, said Simmer, the state health department director. The department could also invest in a fleet of mobile vans that provide prenatal care. Each costs just under $1 million, he said. Ultimately, South Carolina needs more doctors willing to practice in rural areas. Fourteen of its 46 counties lack a single OB-GYN, Simmer said.  “We don’t have providers where we need them,” he said. To that end, he added, the state might consider using student loan forgiveness programs as an incentive for new medical school graduates to practice in rural areas of the state, where obstetricians are scarce. Meanwhile, two programs aimed at improving infant mortality in South Carolina, which were backed by millions of dollars in public and private funding over the past decade, were unsuccessful in hitting the goal.  The Nurse-Family Partnership, for example, which pairs expectant South Carolina mothers with nurses for at-home visits, didn’t have a statistically significant effect on birth outcomes, according to an analysis of the multiyear project, published by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.  CenteringPregnancy, a separate program that offers small-group prenatal education to pregnant women, also failed to improve birth outcomes, said Amy Crockett, a maternal-fetal specialist in Greenville and one of the lead investigators for the state initiative.  Crockett said she recently returned about $300,000 in grant funding to the Duke Endowment, a nonprofit that funds health, faith, and education initiatives in the Carolinas, because the evidence to support ongoing CenteringPregnancy projects simply wasn’t there.  “It’s not the silver bullet we thought it would be,” Crockett said. “It’s time to move on.”  Birth outcomes experts agreed that racism and poverty lie at the heart of this difficult problem, which disproportionately threatens Black infants and mothers in the rural South. Research shows that white doctors are often prejudiced against Black patients and minimize their concerns and pain.  In South Carolina, the maternal mortality rate increased by nearly 10% from 2018 to 2019, according to the latest data, which found that the risk of pregnancy-related death for Black mothers was 67% higher than for white mothers. Upon review, the state health department determined 80% of those pregnancy-related deaths were preventable.  Disparities related to both infant and maternal deaths deserve urgent attention from both the federal and state governments, said Scott Sullivan, division chief of maternal-fetal medicine at Inova Health System in Northern Virginia. Hospitals also bear a huge responsibility as doctors and health care providers must learn how to fairly and adequately take care of Black women and children.  “The idea that we’re going to solve 400 years of racism in an hour’s worth of bias training is a cruel joke. Systems have to remodel their approach,” Sullivan said. “It’s going to take funding, and it’s going to take a sustained effort.”  KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF—an independent source of health policy research, polling, and journalism.

She recognized the unwelcome emotions she had experienced during her first pregnancy and in the months after the child's birth. She said she felt like she was drowning.  ""With my first, my mental health was really stretched, to put it lightly,"" she said. ""I had severe anxiety and OCD, which started when I was pregnant with [my eldest son], about halfway through the pregnancy. Even after he was born, it persisted. It kind of closed my world.""  Wanting to get ahead of the problem this time, she asked her husband, Matt Winter, to find a postpartum doula — a trained professional to support her before, during and after the birth. The very next day, Greer Sargeant, who owns Postmodern Doula, was sitting in Mueller's bedroom in Shelburne, a place Mueller fondly described as her ""nest"" in those early newborn days.  ""Seeing her come in was instant relief,"" Mueller said. ""I'm someone who finds it hard to ask for help, partly because I'm an introvert and partly because sometimes we feel we need to push through.""  For the next two months, Sargeant helped with dishes; laundry; feeding the family cats; playing with the baby's big brother, Aidan; and holding newborn Idris so Mueller could shower or nap. Sargeant fit Mueller with a baby carrier that wouldn't exacerbate her back problems and helped to institute a nap routine for Idris.  Five months after Idris' birth, Sargeant sat in Mueller's living room and told her that the best part of being her doula was helping to affirm all the things that Mueller was doing right by saying such supportive words as, ""You're so sweet to your baby, and you talk so kind to him. Even just the way you would change him — you would chat with him and look into his eyes. There's a reason he's such a happy baby.""  Becoming a doula was Sargeant's teenage dream. She pinpointed the career for herself at 16 after watching a documentary that showed raw footage of birth, with women ""standing in their own power"" instead of the usual ""medicalized, emergency baby stories on TLC.""  Sargeant, now 27, launched her business, Postmodern Doula, in 2019. She was a recent graduate of the University of Vermont, where she had taken classes about disparities in medical care and the impact of bias and racism on the health outcomes of people of color and queer families.  Black women are three times more likely to die from a pregnancy-related cause than white women, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Multiple factors contribute to that disparity, including ""variation in quality healthcare, underlying chronic conditions, structural racism, and implicit bias."" The CDC also reported that mental health is the leading underlying cause of all pregnancy-related deaths.  Sargeant, who's Black, learned that when doulas were a part of births for these folks, the patients had better outcomes.  ""And I was like, that's where I'm meant to be. That is exactly it,"" she recalled.  There aren't any statistics tracking how many doulas are working in Vermont, but Sargeant said she's one of just a few Black doulas in the entire state.  ""I definitely work with a lot of queer families, a lot of families of color, single parents by choice, families that have different histories, whether that be mood disorders or maybe they have a disability. Folks that historically feel underrepresented or less seen, I tend to find a compatibility with being their doula,"" Sargeant said. She also frequently works with people who want to have a vaginal delivery after having had a child delivered by cesarean.  Her services are customized to each family and can include birth doula support, daytime postpartum care and childbirth education. She offers low-cost childbirth education for Black families. She helps families navigate their own parenting styles, from how they feed their children ­— by breast, chest or bottle —to what name they want their children to call them, be it papa, mama, apa or mapa.  ""I don't have a prescribed idea of what's going to work for each family, and I'm very eager to hear the language that fits for them and make them feel comfortable in their home and then adopt that and use that myself,"" she said.  Sargeant always uses the neutral language ""pregnant person,"" rather than ""woman"" or ""mother.""  ""Not every pregnant person is going to be a mother. Some people are pregnant because they're a surrogate,"" she said. ""Some people are on all different spectrums of the gender expression, so that language doesn't fit for them.""  Sargeant said that when language doesn't reflect an individual's gender identity, it can make them feel unsafe, unheard and more likely to feel traumatized by giving birth.  ""I think that I became aware that these things were happening somewhat through my own experience. Particularly my experience of being a queer woman of color and being in places where people would make assumptions about me based on the color of my skin,"" Sargeant said.  click to enlarge Cat Cutillo  Sargeant with Aisha Mueller and her baby Idris Winter  Sargeant has worked with more than 150 families; this year more than 50 percent of her clients are returning families she assisted with an earlier birth. When Sargeant works as a birth doula, she offers education to prepare a family for the arrival of a newborn. She wants to learn specifically what their dream birth experience would be. She's present during the entire birth day or days, at home with a midwife or at the hospital. During the birth, she gives comfort that could range from a massage to repositioning to help facilitate labor. If a partner is there, she offers comfort to them, too. She'll help family members ask questions and glean information from doctors, nurses and midwives.  ""My goal is always to try and slow things down, where it's safe, and give the voice back to the family,"" she said. ""My goal is to measure what a good outcome is, based on what each individual family is hoping for in their birth journey.""  The Maschmeier family has leaned on Sargeant as a birth and postpartum doula for both of their babies. Their youngest child, Maggie, was born a few months ago in the living room of their South Burlington home.  ""As the laboring person, I felt like she was able to read my mind and know what I needed without me being able to even put that into words. That was really helpful,"" Morgan Maschmeier said. ""Every birth has surprises, without a doubt. She has her doula bag — it's like a little Mary Poppins bag — with answers for all the surprises.""  Maschmeier recalled the contents of Sargeant's bag: a small fan for hot flashes, ginger for nausea, honey packets if she needed sugar, as well as the essentials for Sargeant herself, who spent 18 hours at their house for their first child's birth.  ""For us, starting off our parenthood journey with confidence, knowing that we had the birth we wanted, we felt empowered to make decisions for our children going forward ... She's a friend of ours. She feels like family. She's the best,"" said Maschmeier, who works as a pediatric nurse.  Maschmeier was so struck by the role Sargeant played that she decided to go into doula training herself and also signed up to be part of the volunteer doula program at the University of Vermont Medical Center, where she works.  ""I've gotten to give back a little bit what she gave to us, which makes me feel really good. She was the inspiration for that,"" Maschmeier said.  Sargeant takes on no more than two pregnancy cases with babies due in the same two-week period. Once a client reaches 37 weeks, Sargeant is ready for a call at any hour — she sets a special ringtone for each and alerts her backup, doula Jessilyn Dolan, who trained Sargeant. She prepares to spring out of bed at a moment's notice in the middle of a snowstorm. In fact, she said, falling barometric pressure means that babies are more likely to be born during a storm.  ""I have great snow tires on the car, a high-sitting SUV, so that I can make it no matter what. I think I'm probably just as good at 3 a.m. as I am at 3 p.m. ... It's definitely not a nine-to-five life. 'Business-hours doula' is not really a thing,"" she laughed. ""But that's totally OK with me. I love the unpredictability of my life.""  Starting this summer, Sargeant will be teaching childbirth education classes at Lakeside Pediatrics in Burlington and will offer a reduced rate for Black families.

However, target shooters needed a grip that would move less under recoil. Several changes were made to the standard Flat-Top Target to accomplish this. The area of the grip frame behind the triggerguard was raised higher to allow the grip to sit deeper in the hand while the backstrap was raised much higher to prevent the entire sixgun from rocking backward under recoil. The hammer profile was changed to a wide target-style and lowered for easier reach while the trigger was widened to afford the feel of a lighter trigger pull.  The Bisley Model, as this version became known, was named after the English town of Bisley where international target matches were held. It may have been designed as a target pistol, but enough shooters wanted a standard version that Colt brought out the Bisley Model with the same hog wallow trough rear sight in the top of the mainframe and the standard front sight found on the Single Action Army. Less than 1,000 Bisley Flat-Top Target Model guns were produced while more than 44,000 standard model Bisleys came forth.  By 1912 sales of the Colt Single Action Army in general were on the decline, and the Bisley was dropped from the Colt catalog. For the next several years, Bisleys would still be produced from inventory parts on-hand.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vZ3Vuc21hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS9ndW5zL2JpcnRoLW9mLXRoZS1iaXNsZXkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Just two months later, she got her first period - the surgery had an effect!  Now Tamara just had to get pregnant – it finally succeeded last September. She had previously endured multiple failed embryo transfers and an abortion.  However, the pregnancy was not a consistently positive time for Franco. She suffered from preeclampsia.

The cub was born to three-year-old female Jwala who had arrived in India in September 2022.  Forest officials at KNP confirmed the news in a press release, saying the cause of the death of the cub is yet to be ascertained. This is the fourth death of a cheetah reported from the national park in Madhya Pradesh in the past two months.  At present, the number of adult cheetahs stands at 17 and cubs at three.  Wildlife warden JS Chauhan said Jwala was found with her dead cub around 7 am on May 23. “It was seen through video footage that three of her cubs walked with her while the fourth continued to lie on the ground,” he said.  Chauhan added that the monitoring team took a close look and found that the cub had tried to raise its head. “A team of veterinarians was rushed to the spot. But the cub died during the course of treatment. Prima facie it appears that the cub was found in a weak health condition. It was the smallest, least active and most lethargic compared to the other three,” he explained.  The statement said the cub was also found to have consumed less milk compared to the others and its survival had been a cause of increasing concern among officials.  “The death of the cub should be perceived with the lens of ‘survival of the fittest’. In Africa, the survival rate of newborn cheetahs is very less. Experts estimate that only 10 per cent of cubs survive. This means that in a natural environment, only one of every 10 cubs born will survive. Compared with other cat species, the cheetah has the highest birth rates,” the statement said.  In March, Namibian cheetah Sasha was reported dead following renal failure while on April 24, Uday died of cardiac failure. Earlier this month, a female cheetah, Daksha, was found dead by officials while mating with two male cheetahs on May 9.

The Untitled Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Project takes place on the night that Gracie proved Brazilian Jiu-jitsu as the most effective fighting style, one that would ultimately become a major component of today’s UFC mixed martial arts. It more specifically chronicles Gracie’s debut in UFC 1 on November 12, 1993, when the fighter achieved the unthinkable during the organization’s inaugural competition. This night that had him besting three competitors is considered to be that on which the UFC was born.  Derived from Japanese jiu-jitsu, which is rooted in samurai traditions, Gracie Jiu-jitsu formed in Brazil in the 1920s when Japanese fighter Mitsuyo Maeda moved from Japan to Brazil and began training Royce’s uncle, Carlos Gracie. It was Carlos — along with his younger brother Hélio, who fathered Royce — that carried on the tradition across their family and propelled the sport to international fame.  Tucker Tooley (We’re The Millers, Den of Thieves) will produce the new film, with Gracie, Gudegast and Frederico Lapenda to serve as executive producers.  Said Gracie of the fight night the project will examine, “I remember every detail of that night, the intensity of it was palpable but even then I did not appreciate the incredible impact that it would have and the significance that it would carry for years to come, not just for me but for the world of martial arts. Everything I am is because of jiu-jitsu and I’m excited for the world to hear my story.”  “Before Royce Gracie fought in the first UFC, the established fighting world was completely centered on boxing. As the world watched him defeat three fighting champions in one night using his family’s Gracie Jiu-Jitsu method, the UFC was born,” noted Tooley. “The significance of the moment was to the fight world what N.W.A releasing Straight Outta Compton was to the hip hop world – a seismic shift that gave birth to a new and profound genre.”  Remarked Gudegast, who has a black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, “I have thought about telling this story for 25 years after witnessing UFC1 and being in awe of it, and at the same time having had the honor of training Brazilian jiu-jitsu and Vale Tudo with Royce’s family ever since. I believe what Royce accomplished that night is one of the most extraordinary athletic achievements of all time. He and his family are endlessly fascinating, as they embody a true samurai spirit that is from another time. I have nothing but absolute maximum respect for Royce as a man and warrior, and for all the Gracies as the Godfathers of martial arts.”  Gudegast made his directorial debut with the action thriller Den of Thieves, starring Gerard Butler and O’Shea Jackson, Jr., and is currently in the Canary Islands filming the sequel. He was also a writer on Butler’s London Has Fallen and exec produce Lionsgate’s recent action thriller Plane, starring Butler and Mike Colter, which grossed over $52M upon its January release.  Founded by former Relativity President Tooley and Greg Renker, Tucker Tooley Entertainment’s films have thus far grossed more than $2.5B at the worldwide box office. In addition to Den of Thieves 2: Pantera, the company’s recent projects include Lee Daniels’ forthcoming Netflix horror thriller The Deliverance, starring Andra Day; the upcoming Arthur the King starring Mark Wahlberg; Concrete Cowboy for Netflix starring Idris Elba; and Daniels’ The United States vs. Billie Holiday for Hulu, which brought Day her first Academy Award nomination.  Tooley is a Member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, as well as the Producers Guild of America. Among his other best known individual producing credits over the last decade are such titles as Shot Caller, CBS’s Limitless and the film that preceded it, Jane Got a Gun, Beyond the Lights, Out of the Furnace, Oculus, We’re the Millers, 21 & Over and Don Jon.

Grace Chan, MD, MPH, PhD, found this unacceptable. (Photo: Michael Goderre, Boston Children's Hospital)  First in an ongoing series profiling researchers at Boston Children’s Hospital.  Globally, five million children die annually before the age of 5. Forty percent of these deaths are in the first month — and many are preventable.  Grace Chan, MD, MPH, PhD, finds these numbers unacceptable. They contrast starkly with U.S. medicine, including at Boston Children’s Hospital, where she works in the Division of Medical Critical Care. For the last 20 years, she has been asking: How can we improve infants’ chance at life when resources are limited?  Building partnerships to improve maternal-child health  The question has taken her around the world, and most recently to Ethiopia, which accounts for a large share of early childhood mortality. Mothers and babies receive little health care support outside the hospital. Many mothers give birth at home, with minimal prenatal and postnatal care. In rural areas, homes often lack electricity and running water.  Grace Chan and colleagues on a field visit to Angolela Tera, Ethiopia. (Photo courtesy Beza Hunegnaw)  Seeking to improve maternal–child health, Chan partnered with Ethiopia’s Ministry of Health, local leaders, and clinicians at St. Paul’s Hospital Millennium Medical College, Ethiopia’s largest tertiary care hospital. She co-founded HaSET (“happiness” in Amharic), a research program with field sites encompassing 16 villages. Her team visits families’ homes every three months, gathering information and enrolling pregnant women in studies.  “Through partnerships, we grow solutions from the ground up and address concerns raised by the community,” says Chan. “Our work is only possible with great collaborators.”  Chan hopes their research, published in more than 40 articles, will help distribute resources more equitably and lead to sustainable, scalable interventions. Their research has already influenced policies at the Ministry of Health and World Health Organization.  Finding risks, developing interventions  The team set out to understand the risks babies and their mothers face. In low- and middle-income countries, those risks are high. Chan’s team found high rates of preterm birth, low birth weight, stillbirth, or death during the newborn period, as well as substantial rates of sepsis, a life-threatening bloodstream infection.  The team then looks for risk factors and possible ways to address them. For example, they found that encouraging effective “kangaroo mother care” — early breastfeeding and skin-to-skin contact between mother and baby — increases survival in low-birth-weight infants. Chan has since led successful efforts to scale up kangaroo mother care, taking into account the local context.  Mother and child during a household visit by data collectors. (Photo courtesy Beza Hunegnaw)  That meant understanding the barriers mothers face. “It’s hard to do skin-to-skin when moms are out doing field work,” explains Chan. “There is also stigma around low-birth-weight babies. Mothers may be reluctant to show the baby to others, and fathers need to be on board.”  Maternal-child health: Lessons across cultures  At Boston Children’s, Chan cares for children with severe, acute illness in the Intermediate Care Program. She takes some lessons back to Ethiopia, like protocols for tracking drug-resistant infections and choosing antibiotics based on the data.  “Antimicrobial resistance is a growing global crisis further exacerbated by climate change,” Chan says. “In newborns with sepsis at St. Paul’s Hospital and hospitals in other low- and middle-income countries, we found 90 percent rates of resistance to first-line antibiotics.”  Ethiopia also has much to teach about efficiency, resiliency, and functioning with limited resources. This knowledge helped ground Chan during the “tripledemic” of COVID-19, influenza, and RSV, when Boston Children’s was inundated with critically ill children. There are also valuable lessons about empowering families to help with care when hospital staff are overwhelmed.  “No matter where you are, a mom will do anything they can for their child,” Chan says. “That love is the same everywhere.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vYW5zd2Vycy5jaGlsZHJlbnNob3NwaXRhbC5vcmcvbWF0ZXJuYWwtY2hpbGQtaGVhbHRoLWdyYWNlLWNoYW4v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Shah, while speaking at the inauguration of the new Census building in Delhi, said that registration of births and deaths is important for updating citizens’ register, electoral rolls and list of people who avail beneficiary schemes, the Hindu reported.  “If the birth and death certificate data are preserved in a special way, development works can be planned properly. A Bill to link the death and birth register with electoral rolls will be introduced in Parliament. Under this process, when a person turns 18, his or her name will automatically be included in the electoral rolls. Similarly, when a person dies, that information automatically will go to the EC, which will start the process of deleting the name from the voters’ list. Earlier, the development process took place in fragments, because adequate data for development was not available,” he said, according to the Indian Express.  He also said that digital, complete and accurate Census figures will have multidimensional benefits, and planning based on Census data can ensure development of the poorest of the poor, the Indian Express reported.  Meanwhile, the 2021 Census that was initially postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic has been indefinitely postponed. The government has not given any specific reason to postpone the exercise which was last done in 2011, the Hindu report said.  Shah also released a publication at the inauguration of the newly built Janganana Bhawan and said, “Today, history of all Census since 1981 has been compiled and published in the form of a book. The accountability can only be expected when responsibilities are fixed, and with the launch of upgraded SRS mobile application with geofencing today, employees at even the lowest level will become more responsible.”  Sample Registration System (SRS) is a large-scale demographic survey conducted every year by the Registrar General of India (RGI) to estimate the birth rate, death rate, as well as other fertility and mortality indicators.  Talking about the geofencing upgrade, Shah said according to the Hindu, “If a person tries to conduct the survey from somewhere else, it will be known that the person is not present at the block. Even the smallest of errors can have a cumulative effect on the entire data. If any official commits fraud, the system will send alerts at national and state levels.”  While talking about the previous Census, Shah said that they were not accurate and the government will now conduct the Census electronically so that the data can be audited and verified, the Hindu reported.  The minister also said that the data required for framing development schemes was missing in the earlier censuses, the Hindu report said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vdGhld2lyZS5pbi9nb3Zlcm5tZW50L25ldy1iaWxsLXRvLWxpbmstYmlydGgtYW5kLWRlYXRoLXJlZ2lzdGVyLXdpdGgtZWxlY3RvcmFsLXJvbGxzLWFtaXQtc2hhaNIBdGh0dHBzOi8vbS50aGV3aXJlLmluL2FydGljbGUvZ292ZXJubWVudC9uZXctYmlsbC10by1saW5rLWJpcnRoLWFuZC1kZWF0aC1yZWdpc3Rlci13aXRoLWVsZWN0b3JhbC1yb2xscy1hbWl0LXNoYWgvYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Welcome to our series, The Motherhood Diaries – a safe space for you to share your experiences, advice, hopes and heartbreaks. We’ll be hearing from industry experts giving practical advice alongside Capsule readers (You!) sharing your firsthand experiences. We’re looking at everything from fertility, trying to conceive, pregnancy, the fourth trimester, newborns, toddlers, children’s mental health and teenagers, fertility issues and everything in between!  Psychological birth trauma is only recently gaining understanding and air time. In this piece, Kate Hicks, Founder of Birth Trauma Aotearoa, shares her own experience and what led her to create the My Birth Story support website and, more recently, a charitable trust working on behalf of Aotearoa’s birth trauma community.  I remember some things about my first birth experience – I remember hurriedly packing a hospital bag for a hasty exit from home to the hospital.  I remember the specific cream colour of the walls and curtains of the maternity consulting room. I remember falling asleep in the birthing pool, in between contractions – contractions that were off the CTG chart strong and had no breaks for 16 hours.  Sharon McCutcheon/Unsplash Birth trauma was a concept Kate Hicks only learnt about four months post-partum. (file photo)  I remember team in the operating theatre taking turns to introduce themselves to each other and then, once everyone had finished, I said: “And I’m Kate, the Mum” followed by much laughter among the staff.  I remember vomiting and shaking uncontrollably as seven layers of my body were stitched back together after an emergency C section.  There’s a lot I remember about my first birth experience; there’s more I’d like to forget. But I never will, so instead I take power from this experience to drive me to help others.  I don’t tend to share too much detail about my own story – though, having worked in the birth trauma space for the last seven years, I know how powerful sharing a story can be.  Birth trauma was a concept I only learnt about four months post-partum. My (amazing) midwife mentioned it when I expressed to her that I still felt really ‘wobbly’ about my daughter’s birth but couldn’t work out why I felt this way.  I knew it wasn’t post-natal depression. I was anxious, but I didn’t think this was post-natal anxiety either.  What was birth trauma any way?  Trauma is our body and our brain’s way of protecting us from real, or perceived, danger. Birth trauma is trauma that is related to pregnancy, labour, birth and early post-partum.  When we experience danger, our brain immediately sends us into “fight or flight mode”, in order to protect ourselves or our loved ones. This is a very, very normal thing that our brain, and our body, does for us – it’s about survival and it’s totally natural.  When it gets tricky, though, is when the danger passes but we struggle to move past the fight or flight state.When we’ve experienced birth trauma we can experience difficulties in bonding with baby, breastfeeding challenges, relationship issues, confusion and grief, mistrust of medical professionals, anxiety, depression and even post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  UNSPLASH It’s not only mothers and birthing parents – fathers, partners, support people and medical staff can all experience birth-related trauma too.  Birth trauma research is sparse but the little research that exists suggests that one in three birthing people report their birth as traumatic – in Aotearoa, that equates to around 50 people a day emotionally broken from the birth of their child.  And it’s not only mothers and birthing parents – fathers, partners, support people and medical staff can all experience birth-related trauma too.  One of the trickiest things about birth trauma is that it’s subjective – what seems traumatic to one person may not be to another and vice versa. Often, when expressing distress about their birth, people are met with the dismissive attitudes of “at least baby is okay”, or, “what do you expect, it’s birth?!”.  It’s always up to the person to decide whether they’ve had a traumatic experience or not and everyone is deserving of support regardless of what happened – it’s about how we feel about the birth that matters going forward.  The experience of trauma can come from anywhere, but some of the most common causes are a birth experience totally different to the one planned, fearing for one’s own, or baby’s life, procedures done without consent, systemic failures, poor pain management or care from staff, baby needing intensive care (NICU) or baby loss, and the triggering of previous abuse.  But no matter the cause of the trauma, we need to be gentle with ourselves and remember that our response to these threats is very normal and we deserve support to work through the experience.  So where, in Aotearoa, is that support?  Following my own experience I looked high and low for resources to help me understand what I’d just gone through, to remind me that I did nothing wrong and that I wasn’t “making a mountain out of a molehill”. But I came up with very little, and next to nothing that was based here in Aotearoa.  Surely I couldn’t be the only one thinking about this stuff?  Surely I wasn’t the only one coming out of this life-changing experience feeling like this?  And I was right – after talking to many people and maternity sector staff about the idea of an Aoteaora-focused support resource, the resounding reply was: “Yes! We need this!”  The next two years were filled with conversations, meetings and learning as I pulled together the My Birth Story website  Joice Kelly/Unsplash Kate Hicks knew it wasn’t post-natal depression. She was anxious, but she didn’t think this was post-natal anxiety either (file photo).  Fuelled by the need I had first-hand experience of, and with the help of some other generous volunteers, My Birth Story was launched in 2018, right before my own, second baby was born.  My Birth Story offers comfort, validation, and support options for anyone who has had a negative or traumatic birth experience. Since going live, the site has a constant stream of visitors from New Zealand and across the globe.  People need to know that their experience matters, that how they’re feeling matters, and they need to know where to find support. A website is an ideal option as it can be accessed from anywhere, at any time, and completely anonymously.  Since launching My Birth Story my work in the space evolved to include education and advocacy. As I continued this work I could see, very clearly, where the work needed to happen if we are to see any real drop in birth trauma prevalence and support following it.  So, I spent another two years establishing an organisation whose purpose was to work towards that change.  Isabela Drasovean/Unsplash Birth Trauma Aotearoa aims to safe harbours for people so they can thrive in new parenthood instead of just survive it.  Birth Trauma Aotearoa has only been around for a short time but, in that time, we’ve managed to advocate for parents and whānau at various policy meetings, on campaigns, at parliamentary hui, and support service planning.  Our work involves education, advocacy, research and support – and though we’re a new, small organisation, made up of entirely volunteers, we’re fierce advocates for women, birthing people and their whānau. We know our communities deserve trauma-free birth, and when birth trauma does inevitably occur, we deserve excellent support.  Birth Trauma Aotearoa holds equity at the heart of what we do. People experience inequity in care due to various factors – racism and colonisation, ableism, lack of services for rural families etc. – we only need to look at the statistics to find unacceptable examples.  One of the jobs of Birth Trauma Aotearoa is to work at removing these equity barriers so that everyone has equitable access to safe maternity care. Everyone deserves health care that is supportive, well resourced, based on best-practice, and consumer-centred, and never more so is this necessary than when we are welcoming children in to the world.  As Birth Trauma Aotearoa moves forward, our work will continue to advocate for improved and equitable resourcing of the maternity sector, we’ll continue to educate so that people consider the experience of birthing as just as important as what physically happens, we’ll facilitate robust research so we have a comprehensive understanding of birth trauma here in Aotearoa, we’ll campaign for consumer-centred care, and we’ll build empathetic support networks that help people heal.  I had incredible support from my partner, family, midwife, kai awhina and the medical professionals involved in my daughters birth yet still I know what it is like to have a baby and then feel like you’re floating alone at sea alone not knowing where to go or what to do next.  Birth Trauma Aotearoa aims to safe harbours for people so they can thrive in new parenthood instead of just survive it. We feel honoured to do this work.

I-Connect007 chatted with Rex recently about how he became involved with circuit board inventor Dr. Paul Eisler.  Barry Matties: Let’s start at the beginning, Rex. My understanding is you were there when circuit boards were first being manufactured.  Rex Rozario: You're correct. Fortunately for me, when I left university, my first job was with a company called The Telegraph Condenser Company; they had just acquired the first license from Paul Eisler. He developed the printed circuit in a shed in London, circa 1940; they were single-sided boards. He had the patents in 1948 and issued five licenses. We (The Telegraph Condenser Company) were the first to get a license.  Eisler later joined Technograph and worked there for some time. Eventually, Technograph and Telegraph merged.  Matties: Would you say you were the first company to produce a licensed printed circuit board?  Rozario: Technically, we were the first company in the UK to manufacture PCBs. Eisler sold one license to the UK and four others to the U.S. We could appoint other people as well, if they wanted to manufacture under our license.  Matties: So, how did you get involved?  Rozario: Whilst studying for my degree at university, I was lucky to obtain a work/study job in my spare time in a development lab with Daly Condensers Ltd. (UK) where I learned all about manufacturing electrical condensers. This gave me the opportunity, after obtaining my university degree, to apply to the UK's largest condenser manufacturer, The Telegraph Condenser Co., which employed me as a development technician. Three weeks into my new job, I took a pre-arranged vacation for two weeks. When I returned, I was met by a senior director and was marched into the office of the managing director who was already addressing five men. The managing director informed us that Telegraph had just obtained the first license in the world from the inventor Dr. Paul Eisler, who was also engaged by Telegraph as a consultant. I was invited to join the five specialists which Telegraph had tapped to form this new team with Dr. Eisler. We were given 5,000 square feet of a surplus building to further develop and introduce printed circuits to replace manual wiring. This period was circa 1953.  In the beginning, we had to shop around for everything, from the base laminate to the copper foil. We did all that within our team, and then suddenly the printed circuit developed in the UK went from a single- to a double-sided board. For the double sided, we used eyelets until through-hole [electroless copper plating] came along.  Matties: You were along for the journey the whole way.  Rozario: I was just lucky to be there.

The number of newborn babies was 21,138 in March, down 8.1 percent from the same month of last year, according to Statistics Korea. It marked the lowest March figure since relevant data began to be compiled in 1981.  The newborns have been on the decline since December 2015 as more young people delayed or gave up on having children due to economic difficulties such as high housing prices and education costs.  The low birth rate fueled worry about the demographic cliff, which refers to a sharp fall in the heads of households eventually leading to a consumption cliff.  The number of marriages advanced 18.8 percent from a year earlier to 18,192 in March due to the lifting of measures against the COVID-19 pandemic.  The number of divorces gained 4.7 percent to 8,255 in the cited month.  The number of deaths tumbled 35.2 percent to 28,922 due to the weakened pandemic effect.

Of course, things have changed since the bike was launched back in 1999 and not only has production technology progressed, but so has camera tech as well.  So here’s a modern look at the modern incarnation of the Hayabusa, brought to us by Kondor Cars, and ready for you to enjoy.  Before the Hayabusa can even try and touch 200 miles per hour, it all starts at Suzuki’s Hamamatsu Factory in Japan, otherwise known as the birthplace of the Suzuki GSX1300R.  Launched before the turn of the millennium in 1999, as the story went, Suzuki unveiled the GSX1300R Hayabusa, claiming the throne as the fastest production bike in the world with a top speed of 194 miles per hour. The Hayabusa faced some stiff competition back then while all Japanese manufacturers were all duking it out for the title of the “fastest production motorcycle in the world.” After dethroning the Honda Black Bird, and successfully defending the title from Kawasaki’s ZX-12R’s six-mile-per-hour-less-than-the-Hayabusa’s-top-speed before the year 2000 rolled over, the legend was cemented, and Suzuki held the crown for nine straight years until Kawasaki came back with a vengeance.  Gallery: The Suzuki Hayabusa Rolls Into 2023 With New Colorways  3 Photos  Now, Kawasaki’s Ninja ZX-14R continues to hold the record, now 11 years in the making, but the Hayabusa was a cultural hit back then and until now. The name became so widespread and in the minds of old and new enthusiasts alike that Suzuki decided to give it a remake for the 2021 model year.  Now, here’s a deep dive into Suzuki’s Hamamatsu plant, one of the very names that shook up the industry. It’s interesting to see how much has changed with motorcycle manufacturing. Computers are so much better, materials have gotten more advanced. Engines have gotten more powerful, and certainly, cameras are much clearer than before.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJpZGVhcGFydC5jb20vbmV3cy82Njg1Nzgvd2F0Y2gtc3V6dWtpLWhheWFidXNhLWRldmVsb3BtZW50LXByb2R1Y3Rpb24v0gFXaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmlkZWFwYXJ0LmNvbS9uZXdzLzY2ODU3OC93YXRjaC1zdXp1a2ktaGF5YWJ1c2EtZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The unidentified girl was due to appear in court for arraignment at 10.30am on Tuesday and is facing nine charges, including murder, child endangerment, tampering with evidence and gross abuse of a corpse.  The arrest was made after the girl's mother called the Cleveland Division of Police to notify them her daughter had recently given birth and 'threw the babies in the garbage'.  According to police incident report reviewed by WKYC, the caller claimed she did not even know her daughter was pregnant and that she found the babies in the garbage.  Neighbors told the outlet they could hear crying but thought the sound was coming from inside the house.  A unidentified 16-year-old girl has been arrested after two newborn babies were found dead in a garbage can outside a Cleveland home on Saturday  The incident happened on Ludlow Road in east Cleveland last Thursday. The teen was arrested on Saturday  A neighbor, Nicole Shefton (pictured), said she could hear crying on the evening of May 18 but assumed the sound was coming from inside the house  The teen was then discovered in hospital receiving treatment and later arrested by the Cleveland Division of Police.  Residents on Ludlow Road in east Cleveland told the station they could hear babies crying on the evening of May 18, the day on which the twins were allegedly born.  Nicole Shefton lives next door to the teen and said that at around 5.30pm she heard babies crying but thought the sound was coming from inside the house.  'It was muffled but it didn't dawn on us, we thought they were in the house,' she said.  'I wish she would have just set them on my porch, but we don't know her story. We don't know if she panicked, we don't know anything. We cant just assume she dumped them because she didn't want them,' Shefton added.  When Bedford Police Department eventually located the teen she was receiving treatment at University Hospitals Ahuja Medical Center. She was later transferred to its main campus and was monitored by Cleveland officers.  According to a police incident report the teenager's mother called the police to notify them the newborns had been 'thrown in the garbage'  Mike Norman of Cleveland Fire Department wanted to alert Cleveland residents that under state law they have legal ways to deal with newborns if they feel they cannot raise them.  He told WKYC: 'We are here for people on the worst day of their lives. That order explains how to receive the baby, how to arrange for the transport to a medical facility care for the mother.'  Under Ohio law, if parents feel they can't take care of a newborn they can drop an them off at a local 'safe haven' without penalty so long as it's done within 30 days of the child's birth.  The cause and manner of the deaths has not been released but autopsies were carried out.

The fraudulent scheme was scuppered after staff at Cardiff Register Office became suspicious when the baby's name was spelled incorrectly on the application.  Antonian Psota, 24, agreed to put the name of Anderson Gjuta, 23, on his child's birth certificate after he was offered payment. Mr Gjuta had come to the UK illegally and believed he would have more chance of securing a visa to remain in the country if he was registered as the child's father.  A sentencing hearing at Cardiff Crown Court on Tuesday heard the defendants and the child's mother travelled from the West Midlands to Cardiff on March 21. The mother spoke to a registrar while the two men waited outside.

The baby's name was also spelled incorrectly and the date of birth was missing. The registration was refused and the mother later told police she was being forced to sign the documents against her will.  Both of the defendants were arrested at the register office on suspicion of perjury and were taken to Cardiff Bay police station. The men initially denied any wrongdoing and Gjuta maintained he was the child's father.  But Psota and Gjuta, both of Forrester Street, Walsall, later pleaded guilty to making a false statement with intent to have it inserted in a register of birth. The court heard Psota had one previous conviction for possession of a bladed article and Gjuta was of previous good character.  In mitigation Psota was described as ""naive and immature"" for embarking on the fraud but had done so in order to ""establish a home"" for his family. Gjuta was said to have pleaded guilty at the first opportunity and was not successful in having his name placed on the birth certificate.  Sentencing, Recorder Carl Harrison said: ""You were willing to allow your child to have false details on their birth certificate – a document that would be used for the rest of that person's life... This was a deliberate attempt to manipulate public records to circumvent immigration rules for financial gain.""  Psota was sentenced to a total of 36 weeks imprisonment. Gjuta was sentenced to a total of 28 weeks imprisonment.

So I’m going to get out here early tomorrow and get some work in before I leave,” Harris said on Tuesday.  However, the timing does work out well for the veteran quarterback who noted his first two sons were born during the off-season and the pandemic so he has not had to miss any crucial time on the field.  This time around, he shared the Riders told him he was not going to suit up for this weekend’s pre-season matchup against the BC Lions anyway.  “It’s a tough time to leave but at the same time, the team has done a great job telling me they weren’t going to let me miss this. It’s tough leaving camp at this point but obviously if you missed the birth of your child for a game they told me I wasn’t going to play in anyway, it would be a tough one to live with the wife with after, right?” Harris joked.  Harris is headed back to his home state of Ohio for the special occasion.  “My wife goes into the hospital tomorrow in the early evening. So I’m not even getting to go home. I’m going to sleep in the hospital chair for two nights and take the kid home then I’ll be back the next day. But I’m excited that I get to go home and see such a beautiful moment and be there for my best friend in the world, who is my wife. I’ll be watching from afar and know what’s going on,” he added.  Now the Riders are tasked with showcasing their backup quarterbacks in Saturday’s game and head coach Craig Dickenson is still not sure how the team plans to break up the quarterback play between Jake Dolegala, Mason Fine, Shea Patterson, and Noah Pelletier.  “Trevor won’t be there so it’ll be the other three, we’re going to try and give them equal reps,” Dickenson said.  Harris will get one more pre-season opportunity when Saskatchewan takes on Winnipeg next weekend on the road.  “It’s one of those things that obviously I would like to play all four quarters in the first and second game but, you know, it’s not my call, and they told me what to do and I play for them,” said Harris.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vcmVnaW5hLmN0dm5ld3MuY2EvaS1tLWV4Y2l0ZWQtcmlkZXJzLWhhcnJpcy10by1taXNzLXByZS1zZWFzb24tZ2FtZS1mb3ItYmlydGgtb2Ytc29uLTEuNjQxMDAxMtIBQWh0dHBzOi8vYmV0YS5jdHZuZXdzLmNhL2xvY2FsL3JlZ2luYS8yMDIzLzUvMjMvMV82NDEwMDEyLmFtcC5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Thirty-one-year-old Andrea Serrano was arrested and charged with sexual assault on a child by one in a position of trust and sexual assault.  After accepting a plea deal, Serrano’s charges were reduced to incest, according to a KRDO report. The deal avoided her from having to serve 10 years to life as a sex offender.  But despite the plea deal, an El Paso County judge sentenced her to 90 days, according to the Gazette.  The mother of the boy had requested that Serrano be placed behind bars for sexually assaulting her son.  “It sets a bad example for the community…There are no consequences,” she told the judge. “This isn’t right…She needs to go to jail.”  Serrano has since apologized for her behavior.  “I just want to say I’m sorry,” Serrano said.  According to Fountain Police, investigators began looking into the case after receiving a report of “sexual assault on a 13-year-old child.”  “Through further investigation, detectives learned 31-year-old Andrea Serrano was having a sexual relationship with a 13-year-old juvenile male,” the police department wrote in a press release.  She was later arrested “after confirming the relationship” with the teenager.  According to the US Department of Justice, “an estimated 91% of victims of rape & sexual assault are female and 9% are male. Nearly 99% of perpetrators are male,” adding that “around the world, at least 1 woman in every 3 has been beaten, coerced into sex, or otherwise abused in her lifetime. Most often the abuser is a member of her own family or is her partner” and “only 2% of rapists are convicted and imprisoned.”  If you or someone you know is or has been a victim of molestation or any form of sexual abuse, text “STRENGTH” to the Crisis Text Line at 741-741.

In an Instagram post called “my newborn rules”, Nikki Jurcutz – who runs the popular Instagram account Tiny Hearts – shared a list of the things she will be telling visitors before their baby’s arrival next month.  Scroll to continue with content Ad ADVERTISEMENT  Some of the points on the list included “no kissing baby please” and “if you’re sick, stay away”. Anyone who hasn’t had a whooping cough vaccine isn’t allowed to see the baby before she turns six weeks.  There are a number of reasons why people are advised against kissing young babies – from the risk of passing on infections like RSV to triggering allergic reactions or even transferring cold sores (which can prove fatal in some cases).  In the reel, which has over 14,000 likes, Jurcutz – an expert in baby and child first aid – also urged relatives and friends to not show up unannounced and, if visiting, to wash their hands before holding her baby.  Other rules included “give me my baby back if she’s crying” and “please don’t post pics without asking”.  Visitors are also encouraged to not wear perfume or strong smelling scents, to always ask before changing the baby’s nappy, and to hold back on the opinions.  She acknowledged that having these conversations can be “really uncomfortable” once the baby has arrived, which is why she sends the text message before the birth.  And while she received a lot of support from fellow mums, there were also a few who were outraged by the 10-point list.  One person wrote: “Whilst I might agree with some of those comments, I’d tell you exactly where to go if you sent that dictatorial text to me. Good luck with how that one gets received...”  Another said: “Enough with this nonsense already. Kids need a village around them. Mum needs support and [to] not be isolated. We have more rules now but in fact have more problems and illnesses then ever.  “I would be horrified reading these if I were your family members. I can guarantee you will need your family/friends one day.”  But there were also plenty of people who agreed such boundaries were needed and were grateful for the list.  “What a great list! I assumed all this would be common knowledge but I found out with my first born that it wasn’t!” wrote one mum.  Another said: “As someone who’s due within the month, I love lists like this and knowing we aren’t being ‘overprotective’. Keeping our little one safe is high priority and our wishes are important!”  “Family really shat on us for having boundaries, our number one goal was to protect our children and they treated us so disrespectfully because it didn’t align with their ego,” revealed one parent.  Unfortunately, there was a general consensus that while parents wanted to keep their little ones safe, family members would often ignore their wishes.  One parent recalled: “I told every one these things, but sadly I assumed people would get the whooping cough vaccination, but they didn’t and failed to tell me, so make sure you follow up.”  Another added: “I remember requesting no hospital visits the first three days and that was completely ignored.”  Story continues  You can watch the reel and view the full list here.

An estimated 134 lakh babies were born prematurely in 2020, of which 30 lakh or 22 per cent were from India. Pakistan, Nigeria, China, and Ethiopia followed India in the list, according to a World Health Organisation report titled “Born Too Soon”.  advertisement  WHAT IS PRETERM BIRTH  Preterm births are babies born before 37 weeks of pregnancy. Based on gestational age, there are sub-categories of preterm birth:  extremely preterm (less than 28 weeks)  very preterm (between 28 and 32 weeks)  moderate to late preterm (between 32 and 37 weeks)  ""Nearly 50 per cent of all births I witness are premature, among which, 10-20 per cent are severely premature,” Dr Bhabesh Kant Chowdhry, the Chief of Neonatology at AIIMS Patna, told India Today. “The newborn survival rate is unalarming if superior nursing care is given and the staff is competent; else the survival rate drastically falls to nearly 50 per cent.”  Four neurological risks — Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), and intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) — are most difficult to deal with in case of preterm births, Dr Chowdhry added.  ALSO READ Kolkata: Woman gives birth in toilet, throws newborn outside window  WHY DOES PRETERM BIRTH HAPPEN  Most preterm births happen spontaneously, but some are due to medical reasons such as infections, or other pregnancy complications that require early induction of labour or caesarean birth. Experts believe smoking, alcohol consumption, infections, in vitro fertilisation, chronic heart diseases, diabetes etc are some of the other factors leading to preterm births.  Globally, prematurity is the leading cause of death in children under the age of five. At all ages, preterm birth remains the fourth leading cause of loss of human capital worldwide after ischaemic heart disease, pneumonia, and diarrhoeal disease. Deaths due to preterm birth differ widely across regions. More than 90 per cent of extremely preterm babies born in low-income countries die within the first few days of life. The situation in India is not too bright.

Their study was based on data from 980,398 pregnancies in Ontario among 691,242 people between January 2015 and July 2021. Of those, 540 individuals visited an ER or were hospitalized for cannabis use.  The rate of ER and hospital visits related to cannabis use during pregnancy increased to 20 per 100,000 pregnancies, up from 11 per 100,000 since legalization. The study found some patients were intoxicated or “very high” when they sought care, the lead researcher said.  Dr. Daniel Myran, a family physician and addiction specialist, said while the absolute increase in ER visits and hospitalizations was low, many more people may be using cannabis during pregnancy and not ending up in hospital.  Story continues below advertisement  “If that’s the case, I think it has important implications for the health of children who will be born from these pregnancies,” said Myran, a fellow at the Bruyere Research Institute and The Ottawa Hospital.  2:18 Has cannabis consumption increased in Quebec since legalization?  Some of the patients had a cannabis use disorder and were unable to stop using, while about 22 per cent experienced withdrawal, he said.  “This is not someone who used cannabis once or twice during pregnancy,” said Myran, also a post-doctoral trainee at ICES, formerly known as the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences.  The study, which also involved Unity Health Toronto, was published Tuesday in the Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ).  The study suggested some may have used cannabis to relieve symptoms of morning sickness.  Story continues below advertisement  Montreal resident Jordana Zabitsky said that when she was expecting her second child, she knew exactly how to quell the morning sickness that made her miserable _ by smoking more cannabis than during her first pregnancy.  Zabitsky started using cannabis for depression, anxiety and PTSD about two years before the birth of her son in 2016, when she ditched prescription drugs because of their side-effects.  During her first pregnancy, she limited her cannabis use because she worried about whether it could affect her baby.  “I would take about four puffs of a joint once or twice a week,” Zabitsky said.  Her son weighed seven pounds, six ounces when bornat full term and reached all of his milestones, so she decided to use cannabis regularly during her second pregnancy.  “I used it as needed. I didn’t track how much I was using. I just woke up and I would use it because it would prevent me from throwing up in the morning. It helped give me an appetite.”  4:05 Perinatal mood and anxiety disorders  Her daughter was born in 2017 weighing six pounds, 13 ounces and her obstetrician was aware of her cannabis use, said Zabitsky, who co-founded a group called Mothers Mary to support others wanting to try the substance during pregnancy.  Story continues below advertisement  During both pregnancies, she said cannabis also helped ease pelvic pain that made it difficult for her to walk.  “It’s not like we’re sitting around being like, ‘Oh, let’s smoke a joint to get high. You’re sitting there thinking, I really want to get better. I don’t want to feel depressed anymore.”  Dr. Darine El-Chaar, a maternal fetal medicine specialist at The Ottawa Hospital and another study co-author, said some of her patients believe the legalization of recreational cannabis means it’s not so risky during pregnancy _ but that’s not the case.  Multiple studies have shown cannabis use during pregnancy is associated with increased risk of early delivery, low birth weight,along with autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), El-Chaar said.  The study considered low birth weight for babies born at full term to be less than 5.5 pounds.  2:14 Toronto’s Sinai Health managing COVID-19 pregnancies, more complications  Pregnant people, especially those with a history of substance use, mental health conditions and severe morning sickness, would benefit from regular screening by an obstetrician without stigma, she said.  Story continues below advertisement  “We show that the patients who presented with acute care for cannabis had a higher rate of (morning sickness). But we don’t know for sure if that’s pregnancy related or related to cannabis use.”  She said common prescription drugs for morning sickness have been well studied over time and anyone experiencing nauseaor other symptoms during pregnancy should see a health-care provider before considering cannabis.  “I hear all the time from patients that ‘I did it with my other pregnancy. it’s a natural substance. And I often say that it’s not all pregnancies where (babies) are exposed to alcohol, cigarettes or cannabis that they’re going to have negative outcomes. But the proportion of negative outcomes is higher compared to non-use.”  The data did not show a rise in acute care visits for use of other substances, including alcohol and opioids, El-Chaar noted.  The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada says there is strong evidence that cannabis use during pregnancy poses risk of lifelong harm to a developing fetus related to memory function, hyperactive behaviour, anxiety and depression.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZ2xvYmFsbmV3cy5jYS9uZXdzLzk3MTY0OTAvY2FubmFiaXMtdXNlLXByZWduYW5jeS1ob3NwaXRhbC12aXNpdHMtc3R1ZHkv0gFUaHR0cHM6Ly9nbG9iYWxuZXdzLmNhL25ld3MvOTcxNjQ5MC9jYW5uYWJpcy11c2UtcHJlZ25hbmN5LWhvc3BpdGFsLXZpc2l0cy1zdHVkeS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

A Texas woman reunited with her family 51 years after she was kidnapped as a baby, and then raised by another family, legally restored her birth name in court last week.  Now 53 years old, Melissa Highsmith grew up as Melanie Miyoko after she was taken from her parents' home in Fort Worth in August of 1971 by a woman posing as a babysitter. Last November, a family DNA match on 23 & Me finally reunited Melissa with her birth family, who never stopped searching for their lost child.  RELATED: DNA Test Confirms Texas Woman Is 1971 Kidnapping Victim Melissa Highsmith  The woman formerly known as Melanie Walden stood before a judge in Fort Worth and changed her first and last names last Wednesday. As seen in footage shared on Twitter by an NBC-DFW reporter, the entire courtroom stood for a thunderous standing ovation.  Jeffrie Highsmith, Melissa's father, could be heard telling the judge, ""Thank you, your honor."" Then, the judge stood up and joined in the courtroom's applause before posing with the Highsmith family for a photo.  An aged progressed image of Melissa Highsmith and an image of her as a baby Photo: NCMEC  John Brown, Melissa's husband, posted about the emotional proceeding on Facebook.

We want to thank the Lord for this great work that he has done by reuniting Melissa Highsmith back to the Highsmith family.""  In an interview with People last November, before police confirmed the family's private DNA test results this month, Highsmith said she was raised just 10 minutes away from where she was kidnapped by someone who posed as a babysitter.  ""The whole time I was there, it was a bad childhood,"" Highsmith said of life with her captor.  ""I wasn't allowed to go outside and play, and she always sheltered me,"" she recalled. ""And she said the reason she sheltered me was because I was born at home and that I had brain damage ... I used to wonder, 'Why did she even have me if she didn't want me?'""  RELATED: ‘My Heart Right Now Is Just Full’: Missing Melissa Highsmith Is Reunited With Her Family 51 Years After She Was Kidnapped  Highsmith ran away from the woman who raised her at just 15 years old, according to ABC 7.  ""It was abusive, and I ran away at 15 years old. I went to the streets,"" Melissa told ABC. ""I did what I had to do to get by. What does that mean? I worked the streets.""  Highsmith's biological mother, Alta Apantenco, posted a newspaper ad for a babysitter shortly before her daughter was kidnapped. A woman responded to the ad, agreeing to meet then-21-year-old Alta at the diner where she worked, but never showed, according to the Star-Telegram.  The prospective babysitter called later, telling Apantenco that she really wanted the position and had previously babysat other children in her large backyard. Without meeting in person, Apantenco hired the woman over the phone out of desperation, having recently separated from Jeffrie Highsmith.  On August 23, 1971, a well-dressed woman wearing white gloves showed up to her Seminary Road apartment. While Apantenco was asleep, the woman told Apantenco's roommate that she had ""come to pick up the baby"" and took away Melissa, who was last seen wearing a pink dress and white sandals, according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.  Related  Two weeks after Melissa was taken, Apantenco published a plea to her kidnapper on the front page of the Star-Telegram. ""I beg of you to call me,"" Alta wrote. ""I've been going out of my mind.""  After years of searching, now 73-year-old Apantenco told People that she had nearly given up hope. But the family continued to keep their missing relative in their hearts, throwing birthday parties for her each year after her disappearance.  ""My family believed that she was still alive and I wanted to believe it, but I had been disappointed so many times that I just told them, 'Leave me out of it,'"" Apantenco told People. ""I said, 'You go ahead, you try to find Melissa, but please leave me out of it because I don't want to get involved.' I wanted to lay it to rest, but they didn't want to.""  The Highsmith family hopes to press charges against the woman who kidnapped their daughter. However, due to the expired statute of limitations, it may not be possible to press criminal charges.  But in a statement to CBS last November, the Fort Worth Police Department said that ""even though the criminal statue of limitations expired 20 years after Melissa's 18th birthday,"" they are ""committed to completing this investigation to uncover all of the available information concerning Melissa's abduction.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm94eWdlbi5jb20vY3JpbWUtbmV3cy9raWRuYXBwZWQtbWVsaXNzYS1oaWdoc21pdGgtbGVnYWxseS10YWtlcy1vbi1iaXJ0aC1uYW1l0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub3h5Z2VuLmNvbS9jcmltZS1uZXdzL2tpZG5hcHBlZC1tZWxpc3NhLWhpZ2hzbWl0aC1sZWdhbGx5LXRha2VzLW9uLWJpcnRoLW5hbWU_YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

A “super fertile” woman remarkably got pregnant twice within just 28 days and even gave birth to the children on the same day.  Woman Gets Pregnant Twice Within 28 Days, Gives Birth To Two Daughters On The Same Day  Kennedy News & Media  Sophie Small did not realise that she had actually conceived twice in a month's time, even after she gave birth to daughters she had thought were twin sisters. The 30-year-old gave birth to Holly and Darcy in August 2020. The mother initially believed that the two girls who were born on the same day were twins, like every other mom who gives birth to two babies at once.  However, after she had given birth to her two little daughters, the midwives were shockingly alarmed by the difference in size between the infants. While Darcy tipped the scales at 4 pounds, 2 ounces, Holly, who came second into this world, weighed much heavier than Darcy at 6 pounds, 1 ounce.  Later, doctors concluded, after pondering what could have happened to the two children for them to be so different in size, that the babies were conceived about a month apart due to superfetation. For those wondering what superfetation is, it is simply a phenomenon where a second pregnancy occurs shortly after the first one.  The Phenomenon Is So Rare That It Only Has 10 Confirmed Cases Yet  Kennedy News & Media  As per the Cleveland Clinic, ""superfetation is so rare in humans that there are only about 10 confirmed cases. They’re so unique that when they happen, they often make headlines,"" the clinic’s info page states. ""The chance that you’ll be affected by superfetation is close to zero.""  The clinic further claims that a pregnant woman’s body undergoes ""hormonal changes that make it nearly impossible to become pregnant while a fertilised egg (embryo) is already growing inside the uterus.  Sophie, one of the only women who have experienced such a phenomenon, told Kennedy News that her pregnancy was ""horrific."" The mom shared, ""I was carrying two babies who were growing at different stages, but we didn’t know that. They couldn’t figure out why I was so sick. I was expecting twins, but one was bigger than the other.""  She explained, ""They had their own sacs and placentas, so they could feed when they wanted to. She added, ""But they [doctors] couldn’t work out why one twin was bigger than the other.""  It was only after the girls were born that the significance of their size difference prompted doctors to run tests and come to the conclusion that it was a superfetation.

In a rare case, a woman in Jharkhand gave birth to five children at the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) in Ranchi on Monday. All five babies and the mother are said to be in healthy condition. The babies are underweight and have been kept in the Neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for observation.  After the successful delivery, RIMS Ranchi shared the happy news and posted a photo of the newborns on its Twitter handle. Notably, it is the first time in the hospital's history that quintuplets have been delivered.  The tweet read, ""A woman from Chatar has given birth to five children at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at RIMS. The babies are under the supervision of doctors in the NICU. A successful delivery was conducted under the leadership of Dr. Shashi Bala Singh.""  Five children born at once are known as quintuplets, and the odds of conceiving them are 1 in 55,000,000 births. Most quintuplets are a combination of boys and girls, all-male or all-female quintuples are rare.  Though rare, multiple births have become more common in recent years because more people are using fertility drugs and procedures, such as IVF, to help conceive a baby. There are two main ways that a multiple pregnancy can happen, as per the Cleveland Clinic . The first is when one fertilized egg splits before it implants in the uterine lining. The second is when two or more separate eggs are fertilized by different sperm at the same time.  In February this year, Polish-British parents of seven also welcomed quintuplets. The babies were delivered by cesarean section at 29 weeks and still require respiratory support.  The most famous set of quintuplets is the Dionne quintuplets born in Canada in 1934.

"birth","2023-04-24","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-23T16:33:21","Erin Fleurant, MD, and Melissa Simon, MD, MPH, are ob/gyns with subspecialty training in Complex Family Planning  Many of the studies and organizations quoted reference women or females for the intended population of contraceptives. We understand that all persons with a uterus, regardless of gender identity and expression, are pregnancy capable and may desire contraception. Language used in this op-ed reflects original study terminology and is not meant to be exclusive.  Earlier this month, an FDA advisory committee unanimously endorsed what could become the first birth-control pill in the U.S. without a prescription. FDA approval is pending. With the leading cause of unintended pregnancy often cited as lack of contraceptive use (or inconsistent use), it is especially crucial to improve access to over the counter (OTC) contraceptive pills. This is only more important as other aspects of reproductive healthcare have been drastically restricted: abortion procedures have been limited or banned in numerous states; ongoing legislative efforts are aimed at curtailing access even further with restrictions on medication abortion; and additional restrictions on access to contraception may be yet to come.  Beyond the importance of approving birth control OTC, in order to truly ensure broader access, it's also essential to assure the medication is affordable out-of-pocket and to dispel safety misinformation that could stop people from using this form of contraception.  The OTC Cost Dilemma  Approximately one third of adult U.S. women who have ever tried to obtain prescription contraception report barriers to obtaining this prescription, often citing the clinician visit requirement, challenges arriving at the visit, as well as not having a primary clinician. Eliminating the physician requirement with OTC access will most certainly reduce such barriers.  Worldwide, the U.S. is far behind in contraceptive access. Although more than half of U.S. states had legalized pharmacist dispensing of hormonal birth control prior to any recent FDA action for OTC access, this is still lacking compared to other parts of the world. More than 100 countries have had access to OTC oral contraceptive pills without a prescription for over a decade.  National organizations and the public have demonstrated interest in OTC contraceptives during this time frame, with one study reporting over half of U.S. women (62%) interested in OTC birth control pills. However, a concern for costs -- more specifically the cost burden shifting from healthcare systems to the individual as an out-of-pocket expense -- is correlated with this interest. Nearly all surveyed users would be interested in OTC contraception if costs were to remain at $10 or less per monthly pill pack. That drops down to less than 50% of users once monthly costs increase above $20. Affordable pricing of the medication by pharmaceutical companies will be essential for equal access.  Countering the Safety Critics  Critics of OTC hormonal contraception often quote concerns about safety in their argument about restriction access. These critiques over safety come at a time where several OTC medications -- whose approval process was not as onerous or controversial -- can cause severe bodily harm and even death if inappropriately consumed. For example, acetaminophen (Tylenol) is consumed by more than 60 million Americans on a weekly basis, and is often used in combination with many other medication formulations, including opioid medication. Acetaminophen toxicity is the most common inciting factor for liver transplantation in the U.S.  Meanwhile, the safety profile of hormonal contraception has been studied consistently for years. When safety concerns are present, the majority of these are related to only one hormone within contraception (estrogen) not progestin. Norgestrel (Opill) -- the specific birth control pill the FDA advisory committee supports making available OTC -- does not contain any estrogen, and is made up of just norgestrel, a type of progestin.  Norgestrel has been an FDA approved medication -- with a prescription -- for 50 years, with first approval in 1973. Numerous studies have demonstrated the safety of progesterone contraceptive pills and low prevalence of any contraindications to progesterone. In fact, the only CDC absolute contraindication to progesterone only oral contraceptive pills is active breast cancer, with recent studies demonstrating just 0.57% prevalence of breast cancer in persons seeking preventive and contraceptive services. In that same population, if relative contraindications to the progesterone-only pill are also included -- such as history of restrictive bariatric surgery, current anticonvulsive medication, lupus, liver disease/tumors -- the prevalence is still only 2.29%, demonstrating that the vast majority of the intended population will not have any contraindications to initiation of progesterone-only contraceptive pills such as Norgestrel. Additionally, numerous studies have demonstrated the ability of individuals interested in contraception to self-screen for any contraindications with over 90% accuracy, some with over 98% concordance compared to providers.  A Step in the Right Direction  Progress towards an FDA approved OTC hormonal contraceptive pill is a long overdue step in the right direction, especially in today's political and legal climate with unjust restrictions on reproductive rights. As outlined above, the Norgestrel progestin contraception is safe -- especially in comparison to pregnancy and other commonly used over-the-counter medication -- and potential users have continued to demonstrate knowledge of their own health and potential contraindications to medication. While this decision is a promising step in the right direction, we urge the administration and pharmaceutical companies to carefully review individual costs associated with such a landmark approval. An individual using contraception may use the pill method for months to years, and thus consideration of the long-term monetary investment -- and potential to worsen existing disparities in healthcare -- cannot be overlooked. It's time to provide individuals with their bodily autonomy and the ability to make their own reproductive health decisions.

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }}  A Texas mother who was forced to give birth to her stillborn son in Texas has joined a lawsuit against the state with seven other women who were denied abortions while facing severe pregnancy complications.  Kiersten Hogan, from the Dallas-Forth Worth area, shared her personal experience of being denied reproductive healthcare in Texas while facing severe pregnancy complications with The Center for Reproductive Rights.  “I was made to feel less than human,” Ms Hogan said. “Texas law caused me to be detained against my will for five days and treated like a criminal, all during the most traumatic and heartbreaking experience of my life.”  Ms Hogan found out she was pregnant in June 2021 while living in Oklahoma with her boyfriend. According to her testimony, she was surprised by the news as she had a history of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and miscarriages but she was excited.  Shortly after finding out, Ms Hogan said she was forced to leave her boyfriend because he became violent and insisted she get an abortion. She moved to Texas to seek a new life.  In the first few months of pregnancy, Ms Hogan went to the emergency room multiple times with cramping and bleeding. Doctors insisted everything was okay, she said. But at 19 weeks pregnant in September 2021, Ms Hogan’s water broke and she experienced cervical insufficiency.  However, Ms Hogan was unable to obtain an abortion due to Texas law Senate Bill 8 which outlawed abortions after roughly six weeks of pregnancy in all cases unless the mother’s life is at risk.  SB 8 went into effect on 1 September 2021.  Ms Hogan was forced to stay in the hospital until she went into labour or her condition worsened to the point where hospital staff could give her an abortion.  Hospital staff told Ms Hogan if she tried to leave it could be used as evidence that she was trying to kill her baby and criminal charges could be brought against her.  For four days, Ms Hogan said she felt “trapped” and “terrified” inside the hospital as she waited until she gave birth to her stillborn son.  Now, Ms Hogan is joining the lawsuit Zurawski v State of Texas, filed by the Center for Reproductive Rights on behalf of women denied abortions since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade.  Ms Hogan said, “I’m joining this case because women deserve better.”  The lawsuit, initially filed in March 2023 on behalf of five Texas women, is demanding the state of Texas “clarify the scope of the state’s ‘medial emergency’ exception under its extreme abortion bans,” according to the Center for Reproductive Rights.  Since its filing, eight more women have joined and three have shared their stories of experiencing a lack of healthcare during a terrifying time in their life – including Ms Hogan.  Molly Duane, Senior Staff Attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights said in a statement, “The Texas government must answer for their laws that have nearly killed these women and that put more lives at risk every day.”  “It is clearer than ever that abortion is a vital part of maternal health care, and health care decisions should be left to doctors and patients, not politicians. The court must act now to protect pregnant Texas.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvLnVrL25ld3Mvd29ybGQvYW1lcmljYXMvdGV4YXMtbW90aGVyLWFib3J0aW9uLWxhd3N1aXQtYjIzNDQzOTcuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Canedo’s newest parents – Luca Truddaiu, 25, and Elisa Nervetti, 36, who gave birth to Marghelisa earlier this month – have become local heroes.  “The community reacted with astonishment, with extreme happiness,” Mr Truddaiu, who works as an estate agent in the nearby town of Stradella, told i . “The mayor has called to give us his congratulations.”  Located in the hills of northern Italy’s Oltrepò territory that is famed for its fizzy red wines, Canedo is administered by the slightly larger village of Romagnese, which has 560 inhabitants.  The birth has offered rare good news as Italy battles against chronic depopulation, said Manuel Achille, the 31-year-old Mayor of Romagnese.  “Every day we fight to keep this place alive,” the mayor said of the village. “There are people who give birth here and choose to live here – this is a good sign.”  Italy’s population fell to 59 million last year, down by 1.5 million from five years earlier, as births plummeted to a historic low of 393,000 compared with 713,000 deaths, according to Istat, the Italian national institute of statistics.  Experts predict the country’s population will fall by another five million by 2050, jeopardising its ability to pay its pensions bill. Italy will top the EU for population decline in 2100, Eurostat forecasts.  Giorgia Meloni, the Prime Minister, and Pope Francis appeared side by side this month at a general assembly on Italy’s declining birth rate.  The Pope blamed poor job prospects, prohibitively expensive houses and rents, and low wages, before complaining that animals are replacing children in some households.  Remote villages have been hit especially hard as their youngest residents are lured by job prospects in bigger cities.  Romagnese’s population dropped from 901 in 2002 to 580 in 2021, according to Istat. The current number is closer to 560, Mr Achille said.  While the village’s full range of services – including a post office, a bank, schools and a historic pharmacy – may help draw newcomers, keeping these facilities open is “not at all easy”, Mr Achille admitted.  The tiny residential settlement of Canedo, in northern Italy’s Oltrepò region, is home to just nine people (Photo: Manuel Achille)  Romagnese has tried to attract nature lovers by opening over 100km of woodland walking paths that wind past numerous waterfalls.  Mr Truddaiu and Ms Nervetti abandoned Stradella four years ago for more peaceful lives in Canedo, where they live in a property owned by Ms Nervetti’s parents, Mr Truddaiu said.  While Canedo is “not the first place a 22-year-old would usually dream of moving to”, Mr Truddaiu said, the “peace and quiet you enjoy after a long day at work” is one of its many plusses.  The couple are thrilled to be bringing up a child in such a friendly environment immersed in nature.  “Every few weeks the residents organise a barbecue for the entire community in different locations, depending on where the sun is shining,” Mr Truddaiu added. “We have so much space at our disposal.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vaW5ld3MuY28udWsvbmV3cy93b3JsZC9pdGFsaWFuLXZpbGxhZ2UtcmVzaWRlbnRzLWJpcnRoLWZpcnN0LWJhYnkteWVhcnMtMjM1ODYzM9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

And it’s not ‘cultural Marxism’, 18 May). Ms Toynbee is surely right to point to the withdrawal of practical state support and nurturing for young families as an important issue. But why doesn’t she mention the general atmosphere of foreboding and anxiety about the future (equally an outcome of years of Tory neglect and misrule) as an even more powerful influence?  As an older person who has been involved during the past four years in an organisation campaigning for urgent action on the climate crisis, I have been frequently startled (and dismayed) by the statements of young people from the UK and other countries, who say that they are reluctant or afraid to have babies when future prospects look so uncertain and daunting.  The conception of a child is surely first and foremost an expression of hope. Many young people simply don’t have enough confidence that the world is a safe enough place to bring a child into.

"birth","2019-01-24","Not Discerned","{""Washington"", ""DistrictOfColumbia"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T08:58:00","(Washington, DC) – U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and U.S. Senator Maggie Hassan (D-NH), a member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pension (HELP) Committee, joined U.S. Senators Mazie Hirono (D-HI) and Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) to reintroduce their bicameral Affordability is Access Act. The legislation would ensure that once the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) determines an over-the-counter birth control option to be safe, insurers fully cover over-the-counter birth control without any fees or out-of-pocket costs. Companion legislation was also introduced in the House of Representatives. The introduction comes after the FDA Advisory Committee’s unanimous vote recommending that the FDA move forward to approve the first-ever application for over-the-counter birth control.  Recent polling has found that nearly 8 in 10 voters have a favorable view of birth control pills and more than 7 in 10 support making the pill available over-the-counter. The Affordability is Access Act addresses the reality that for many—especially those with the tightest budgets—true access requires affordability.  “As women’s comprehensive access to reproductive health care services are rolled back, curtailed or cut off by extreme GOP-controlled state legislatures, every effort must be made to keep this essential care within reach. That’s why it’s paramount that Congress is proactive to put measures in place that will keep over-the-counter birth control affordable for all Americans, pending the FDA’s final determination,” said Shaheen. “I urge the FDA to move swiftly and follow in the footsteps of the Advisory Committee to make birth control available to women over-the-counter, and for Senate leadership to act in tandem so we can ensure it’s accessible to anyone who seeks it.”  “The ability to access and afford birth control can be a central part of a woman’s reproductive freedom,” said Hassan. “While anti-choice extremists are focused on stripping away a woman’s fundamental rights, it’s more important than ever that we take steps to protect a woman’s freedom. Our bill ensures that if the FDA makes birth control available over the counter, women who want it can afford to get it. I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this commonsense legislation.”  Under the Affordable Care Act, all private health insurance plans are required to fully cover — without copays or out-of-pocket costs — all U.S. FDA-approved, granted, or cleared methods of contraception. The Affordability is Access Act would ensure that this also applies to over-the-counter birth control. The Affordability is Access Act would also maintain the FDA’s sole authority to determine the safety and efficacy of drugs and make them available over the counter without a prescription, and ensure retailers provide contraception without a prescription. The legislation states that any retailer that stocks contraception that the FDA has approved, granted, or cleared without a prescription may not interfere with a consumer’s access to or purchase of such contraception.  The bill is co-sponsored by U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Jack Reed (D-RI), Brian Schatz (D-HI), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Tom Carper (D-DE), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Peter Welch (D-VT), Tina Smith (D-MN), John Fetterman (D-PA), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Martin Heinrich (D-NM) and Chris Van Hollen (D-MD).  The bill is endorsed by: Contraceptive Access Initiative (CAI), National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association (NFPRHA), National Health Law Program, Upstream USA, Reproductive Health Access Project, American Humanist Association, Physicians for Reproductive Health, National Partnership for Women & Families, Healthy Teen Network, Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice, Jacobs Institute of Women's Health, The National Organization for Women, NARAL Pro-Choice America, The American College of Nurse-Midwives, Coalition to Expand Contraceptive Access (CECA), The Guttmacher Institute, Power to Decide, Planned Parenthood Federation of America, The National Association of Nurse Practitioners in Women’s Health (NPWH), National Coalition of STD Directors, Ibis Reproductive Health, Population Connection Action Fund, The Center for Biological Diversity, National Council of Jewish Women, Collaborative, Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, National Women’s Law Center, American Public Health Association, National Latina Institute for Reproductive Justice, Advocates for Youth, The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, The Association of Maternal & Child Health Programs, Catholics for Choice, and In Our Own Voice: National Black Women’s Reproductive Justice Agenda.  Read the full text of the Affordability is Access Act here.  Shaheen and Hassan are steadfast defenders of women’s reproductive freedom. In recent weeks, Shaheen has led two initiatives to specifically protect servicewomen’s access to comprehensive reproductive health services, which include bringing costs for contraceptives for those who rely on TRICARE in line with what civilians pay, as well as providing paid leave for abortion and other reproductive care needs. For years, Shaheen has fought to expand coverage of women’s reproductive health and successfully pushed an effort through Congress that was signed into law to ensure servicewomen have access to abortions in cases of rape or incest. Shaheen and Hassan recently helped reintroduce the Equal Access to Abortion Coverage in Healthcare (EACH) Act, a bicameral bill that would help guarantee abortion coverage—without restrictions—for millions of Americans. Senators Shaheen and Hassan are also leaders in the fight to protect Title X family planning centers.  ###","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oYXNzYW4uc2VuYXRlLmdvdi9uZXdzL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL3NoYWhlZW4tYW5kLWhhc3Nhbi1wdXNoLWZvci1vdmVyLXRoZS1jb3VudGVyLWJpcnRoLWNvbnRyb2wtaGVscC1yZWludHJvZHVjZS1hZmZvcmRhYmlsaXR5LWlzLWFjY2Vzcy1hY3TSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

""It was not the original plan to be that close to graduation ... but Bodie had other plans,” she said.  Bailiff eventually gave birth to Bodie on May 3, at 3:08 p.m. without complications and stayed overnight at the hospital before being discharged the following day — the day of her graduation, which had been scheduled for 3 p.m.  ""I was still debating on whether I was going or not, because I didn't want to be, like, a bad mom and just up and leave him right when I got home,"" Bailiff told GMA.

It has been edited for length and clarity.  I loved being pregnant. And pregnancy loved me back. It was one of the reasons I gave birth to five sets of twins within the space of eight years.  The main reason was that I wanted to help other people. I was a surrogate mother to the last three sets of twins. I loved being able to give the gift of children to two couples with fertility issues.  It all started with the birth of my identical sons, Jackson and Joel, in 2008. They were born 2 ½ after my husband, Jon, and I got married.  I got back to my original weight quickly after each of the 5 pregnancies  At first, it was a bit of a shock that we were expecting twins. I threw up about once a week throughout the pregnancy, but I didn't mind. My doctor said that it was a textbook pregnancy otherwise. He called it ""uneventful.""  I loved eating whatever I wanted during those nine months. I gained 30 pounds — the same amount I gained during my subsequent pregnancies. Each time, I got back to my original weight soon after I gave birth.  The boys were born vaginally at 38 weeks and five days. I labored as normal. In my home state of Iowa, if you're having multiples, you have to give birth in the operating room in case something goes wrong. But everything went fine, and the boys were born three minutes apart.  Waters shows off each of her bumps with her biological twins when she was 36 weeks into her the pregnancies. Left, her first pregnancy, with identical boys. Right, her second pregnancy, with fraternal twin girls. Jennifer Waters  We found out we were pregnant again in 2010. I was dying to know whether it was just one or two because I had almost 2-year-olds at the time. I needed to know what we were going into. When I had my first ultrasound, before the tech had time to say anything, I saw two heads. ""Oh, my gosh, it's twins again,"" I said.  ""You better play the lottery now you've got two sets of twins,"" my doctor said jokingly.  ""We can't afford to play the lottery,"" I replied.  They were fraternal girl twins. It's very, very rare to have two sets of twins, especially when they're conceived spontaneously, rather than via in vitro fertilization.  My pregnancy was great. I kept very active because I had toddlers. I worked as a paralegal, and the boys were in day care. I was induced at 36 weeks in May 2011 because I had some hypertension. But Julianne and Jocelyn were born vaginally and healthy.  I was approached by a couple who wanted to hire me as a surrogate mom  It was hard having four kids under 3, though we had a lot of help from grandparents who lived nearby.  Partly because I enjoyed being pregnant so much, I thought about being a surrogate mother. My mom had once intended to be a surrogate for a friend. But she wound up needing an emergency hysterectomy, so she couldn't. I'd always thought it was wonderful that she'd wanted to help other people.  I started blogging about my experiences as a mom of two sets of twins. Then, through a friend, I was approached by a couple, Megan and Mike Andre. They asked whether I'd be interested in being their surrogate.  Waters with Megan and Mike Andre, left, and with Heidi and Spencer Goettsch, right, when she was pregnant with their respective twins. Jennifer Waters  We had a lot of chemistry. I knew I wanted to help them start a family.  ""We were blessed twice with two sets of twins,"" Jon told me. ""If you can help somebody else, let's do it.""  We didn't go through an agency. Our attorneys drew up a contract and the payment plan, which I've always kept private. I got pregnant after the first transfer of the embryos that the Andres had created through IVF.  They were delighted when they found out they were expecting boy-girl twins. I sent them belly pictures every week, and we talked on the phone every other day. They were very involved.  Dax and Ivy were born in December 2013. I had a C-section for them. I'll never forget the look on Mike and Megan's faces when they held their babies for the first time. I felt privileged to bring them such joy.  My doctor joked that I had a 'uterus of steel' because of my successful twin pregnancies  My doctor helped arrange my second surrogacy. He introduced me to his patients Heidi and Spencer Goettsch, who'd been unable to have more kids after their son, Grady, was born. We hit it off, and they hired me. Both embryos took.  After that, my friends said that I'd be walking around and my uterus would fall out. ""No,"" I laughed. ""The doctor says that I have a uterus of steel. It's not going anywhere.""  I gave birth to girl-boy twins, Reece and Quinton, in February 2015. I had my second C-section. When I handed them to Heidi and Spencer, I joked, ""Please go and enjoy these beautiful children — and good luck!""  All 17 members of the Waters, Andre, and Goettsch families at their recent reunion. Jennifer Waters  The next year, Mike and Megan asked whether I'd be their surrogate one more time. They wanted to expand their family. It was a no-brainer.  ""Get them into the miracle uterus,"" the IVF doctor said during the embryo transfer. Gage and Violet, boy-girl twins, were born in October 2016. I had a vaginal birth after cesarean. I'm 40 now and done having kids — whether it's for Jon and me or any other would-be parents.  The twins made little cards for me to say thank-you  The Andre and the Goettsch families have kept in close contact with us. I'm an amateur photographer, and we reunited for a photo shoot in January. Everybody got on fine. It was really cute because Dax and Ivy, Reece and Quinton, and Gage and Violet made little cards for me. They thanked me for helping give them life.  My heart was full of pride.  Do you have a powerful story to share with Insider?

Should she be successful, Mississippi would join neighboring states such as Tennessee, Louisiana, Arkansas and Florida in providing an alternative to giving birth in a hospital setting for pregnant women who are low-risk. The birth center would also be a place for women to receive prenatal care from certified nurse midwives as well as postpartum support.  But after nearly a year working to secure funding for her nonprofit Sisters in Birth to open the center, she’s come up short – and she blames what she calls an unfair and unclear federal funding process funneled through the state’s members of Congress.  Israel applied for federal funds through a lesser-known program called Community Project Funding in which constituents can request their senator or representative recommend their projects for funding to the U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations. Only nonprofits are eligible for the funds, and lawmakers must also certify that they and their immediate family members do not have a financial interest in the organization.  She said despite providing ample evidence of the benefits of birth centers and midwife care to mothers and babies, plus a letter of support from State Health Officer Dr. Dan Edney, Republican U.S. Sens. Roger Wicker and Cindy Hyde-Smith – whom she refers to as “so-called pro-life” – and Democratic 2nd District U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson did not refer her project for funding.  However, they did request funding for projects for nonprofits with millions in net assets and hired lobbyists – a point with which Israel, whose organization reported around $5,000 in negative net assets on its most recently available tax form, took issue.

I identified 13 large, wealthy organizations, which primarily receive the bulk of this recommended funding for fiscal years 2023 and 2024 – they have total net assets of tens of millions of dollars,” she said. “Several of these organizations aren’t in Mississippi.”  She said small nonprofits in Mississippi desperately need funding but may not be aware of how to get it, much less successfully get on any congress member’s recommended funding list.  “There are thousands of nonprofit organizations in Mississippi; the majority are small and struggling to provide crucial services to Mississippians. These organizations likely have never heard of these federal earmark programs because our congressional members fail to promote it,” she said. “Consequently, only corporations with relationships to legislators or their staff will know to apply.”  Information about Community Project Funding is on each Congress member’s website, along with a page dedicated to information about applying for federal grants. General guidance for applying for Community Project Funding is online.  Neither Wicker nor Hyde-Smith responded to questions for this story. In an emailed statement, Thompson said no favoritism is given to particular applications but declined to answer specific questions.  “Each application stands on its own,” the statement said. “The federal government considers supporting a variety of federal programs. However, this application wasn’t selected through the (Community Project Funding).”  Wicker’s office requested $1.5 million for a D.C.-based group called Reading is Fundamental Inc. to implement a childhood literacy program in Mississippi. His office also recommended sending $997,000 to a group called Save the Children, also located in D.C., for a project that would provide learning resources to children and families in rural communities in the state.  Wicker is not the only Mississippian to steer funding to Save the Children – the well-regarded humanitarian organization also received TANF money from the Mississippi Department of Human Services in 2017. In 2021, Gov. Tate Reeves awarded the organization $460,000 in pandemic relief funds, and the organization also receives funding from the Mississippi Department of Education for literacy, nutrition and fitness programming in the schools.  Hyde-Smith’s requested projects for fiscal year 2024 included everything from $7 million for a road project in a wealthy area of Madison County to millions for training programs at universities and community colleges to $4 million for water supply improvements for the city of Byram.  In fiscal year 2023 – the year for which Israel first applied for funds through Thompson’s office – his office requested hundreds of thousands each to cultural projects like the Community Museums of African American History and Culture Project in Belzoni and the Catfish Row Museum in Vicksburg. Also on the list was $2 million for the construction of a new clinic in Greenville.  A 2018 evaluation of a federal study of health and cost outcomes for mothers and babies on Medicaid showed women who received care in birth centers had better outcomes – including lower rates of preterm birth, low birthweight and fewer C-sections compared to other Medicaid participants with similar characteristics. Those in the study who received midwife-directed care at a birth center also cost an average of $2,010 less than their Medicaid counterparts.  Israel believes such a clinic would improve maternal and infant health outcomes by minimizing medical interventions and reducing Mississippi’s first-in-the-nation C-section rates. Midwives’ holistic approach, she said, could also have a positive impact on the state’s high rates of preterm and low birthweight babies.  There are currently about 400 birth centers open and providing care in the U.S., according to the American Association of Birth Centers. Mississippi is one of only eight states that does not have a birth center.  Jill Alliman, a certified nurse midwife who is on the board of directors of the American Association of Birth Centers, said birth centers are especially equipped to handle pregnant women with social risk factors such as mental health challenges, lower education levels or a history of domestic violence – common challenges in a community like Jackson.  Alliman said the presence of a birth center and the midwife-centered care that comes along with it could be “life changing.”  “I think that in states like Mississippi that have so many challenges with maternal and infant health, there needs to be a big effort to increase access to the midwifery model of care and to offer options for birth center care because it’s part of the solution,” she said. “We can see that doing what we’ve been doing for so long is not working.”  Mississippi’s maternal mortality rate is worsening, the latest data shows. The rate increased from 33.2 deaths per 100,000 live births in the time span of 2013 to 2016 to 36.0 deaths per live births from 2017 to 2019.  The worsening rate disproportionately impacts Black women, who had a rate of 65.1 deaths per 100,000 live births – more than four times the ratio for white women.  “The (maternal and infant health) outcomes are deplorable in Mississippi. Over the last 50 years, those numbers just seem to get worse,” Israel said. “ … Midwives put an intervention in place. She’s looking at the whole person and treating the whole person.”  State Health Officer Dr. Daniel Edney echoed Israel in a letter of support he wrote for Israel’s birth center, calling it “change that cannot wait” in Mississippi.  “As you know, many women in Mississippi are unable to access prenatal care and adequate labor and delivery options that are safe for both mothers and babies,” he said. “… The use of birthing centers, with affiliations with critical access hospitals, is one of those evidence-based options that has demonstrated success in improving health outcomes for mothers and babies.”  Officials with the Mississippi State Medical Association declined to respond when asked for the organization’s position on birth centers.  Israel has shifted her approach: she is now reaching out to private organizations for fundraising. She has also produced a documentary about birth disparities in Mississippi that she is promoting nationwide to raise awareness about the issues facing Mississippi and to let people know they can help by donating money to build a birth center.  She said she’s found an ideal location in the medical district in Jackson and plans to purchase it.  However, In the meantime, women are driving to Memphis and Baton Rouge for birth centers, she said.  “I’m done looking inside the state of Mississippi. I’ve knocked on many doors – corporations, foundations, city and local governments … There’s no (financial) support in Mississippi, but I know women want this. I’m not driven by these so-called leaders. I’m driven by what women want.”  Clarification 5/24/23: This story has been updated to attribute a statement to U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson.

"birth","2019-10-29","Not Discerned","{""Birmingham"", ""Alabama"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T20:10:26","Angelica Lyons knew it was dangerous for Black women to give birth in America.  As a public health instructor, she taught college students about racial health disparities, including the fact that Black women in the U.S. are nearly three times more likely to die during pregnancy or delivery than any other race. Her home state of Alabama has the third-highest maternal mortality rate in the nation.  Then, in 2019, it nearly happened to her.  What should have been a joyous first pregnancy quickly turned into a nightmare when she began to suffer debilitating stomach pain.  Her pleas for help were shrugged off, she said, and she was repeatedly sent home from the hospital. Doctors and nurses told her she was suffering from normal contractions, she said, even as her abdominal pain worsened and she began to vomit bile. Angelica said she wasn’t taken seriously until a searing pain rocketed throughout her body and her baby’s heart rate plummeted.  Rushed into the operating room for an emergency cesarean section, months before her due date, she nearly died of an undiagnosed case of sepsis.  Even more disheartening: Angelica worked at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, the university affiliated with the hospital that treated her.  Her experience is a reflection of the medical racism, bias and inattentive care that Black Americans endure. Black women have the highest maternal mortality rate in the United States — 69.9 per 100,000 live births for 2021, almost three times the rate for white women, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Black babies are more likely to die, and also far more likely to be born prematurely, setting the stage for health issues that could follow them through their lives.  “Race plays a huge part, especially in the South, in terms of how you’re treated,” Angelica said, and the effects are catastrophic. “People are dying.”  To be Black anywhere in America is to experience higher rates of chronic ailments like asthma, diabetes, high blood pressure, Alzheimer’s and, most recently, COVID-19. Black Americans have less access to adequate medical care; their life expectancy is shorter.  From birth to death, regardless of wealth or social standing, they are far more likely to get sick and die from common ailments.  Black Americans’ health issues have long been ascribed to genetics or behavior, when in actuality, an array of circumstances linked to racism — among them, restrictions on where people could live and historical lack of access to care — play major roles.  Discrimination and bias in hospital settings have been disastrous.  The nation’s health disparities have had a tragic impact: Over the past two decades, the higher mortality rate among Black Americans resulted in 1.6 million excess deaths compared to white Americans. That higher mortality rate resulted in a cumulative loss of more than 80 million years of life due to people dying young and billions of dollars in health care and lost opportunity.  A yearlong Associated Press project found that the health challenges Black Americans endure often begin before their first breath.  The AP conducted dozens of interviews with doctors, medical professionals, advocates, historians, and researchers who detailed how a history of racism that began during the foundational years of America led to the disparities seen today.  Angelica Lyons’ pregnancy troubles began during her first trimester, with nausea and severe acid reflux. She was prescribed medication that helped alleviate her symptoms but it also caused severe constipation.  In the last week of October 2019, while she was giving her students a test, her stomach started to hurt badly.  “I remember talking to a couple of my students and they said, ‘You don’t look good, Ms. Lyons,'” Angelica recalled.  She called the University of Alabama-Birmingham Hospital’s labor and delivery unit to tell them she was having a hard time using the bathroom and her stomach was hurting. A woman who answered the phone told her it was a common pregnancy issue, Angelica said, and that she shouldn’t worry too much.  “She made me feel like my concern wasn’t important, and because this was my first pregnancy, I decided not to go because I wasn’t sure and thought maybe I was overreacting,” Angelica said.  The pain persisted. She went to the hospital a few days later and was admitted.  She had an enema — a procedure where fluids are used to cleanse or stimulate the emptying of bowels — to alleviate her constipation, but Angelica continued to plead with them that she was in pain.  “They were like, ‘Oh, it’s nothing, it’s just the Braxton Hicks contractions,'” she said. “They just ignored me.”  She was sent home but her stomach continued to ache, so she went back to the hospital a day later. Several tests, including MRIs, couldn’t find the source of the issue.  Angelica was eventually moved to the labor and delivery floor of the hospital so they could monitor her son’s heartbeat, which had dropped slightly. There, they performed another enema that finally helped with the pain. She also was diagnosed with preeclampsia, a dangerous condition that can cause severe pregnancy complications or death.  Then she began to vomit what appeared to be bile.  “I got worse and worse with the pain and I kept telling them, ‘Hey, I’m in pain,’” Angelica said. “They’d say, ‘Oh, you want some Tylenol?’ But it wasn’t helping.”  She struggled to eat dinner that night. When she stood up to go to the bathroom, she felt a sharp pain ricochet throughout her body.  “I started hollering because I had no idea what was going on,” she said. “I told my sister I was in so much pain and to please call the nurse.”  What happened next remains a blur. Angelica recalls the chaos of hospital staff rushing her to labor and delivery, putting up a blue sheet to prepare her for an emergency C-section as her family and ex-husband tried to understand what went wrong.  She later learned that she nearly died.  “I was on life support,” recalled Angelica, 34. “I coded.”  She woke up three days later, unable to talk because of a ventilator in her mouth. She remembers gesturing wildly to her mother, asking where her son, Malik, was.  He was OK. But Angelica felt so much had been taken from her. She never got to experience those first moments of joy of having her newborn placed on her chest. She didn’t even know what her son looked like.  Maternal sepsis is a leading cause of maternal mortality in America. Black women are twice as likely to develop severe maternal sepsis, as compared to their white counterparts. Common symptoms can include fever or pain in the area of infection. Sepsis can develop quickly, so a timely response is crucial.  Sepsis in its early stages can mirror common pregnancy symptoms, so it can be hard to diagnose. Due to a lack of training, some medical providers don’t know what to look for. But slow or missed diagnoses are also the result of bias, structural racism in medicine, and inattentive care that leads to patients, particularly Black women, not being heard.  “The way structural racism can play out in this particular disease is not being taken seriously,” said Dr. Laura Riley, chief of obstetrics and gynecology at Weill Cornell Medicine and New York-Presbyterian Hospital. “We know that delay in diagnosis is what leads to these really bad outcomes.”  In the days and weeks that followed, Angelica demanded explanations from the medical staff of what happened. But she felt the answers she received on how it occurred were sparse and confusing.  A spokesperson for the University of Alabama at Birmingham said in a statement to The Associated Press that they couldn’t talk about Angelica’s case because of patient privacy laws. They pointed to a recent internal survey done by its Obstetrics and Gynecology department that showed that most of its patients are satisfied with their care and “are largely feeling respected,” and said the university and hospital “maintain intentional, proactive efforts in addressing health disparities and maternal mortality.”  Angelica’s son, Malik, was born eight weeks early, weighing under 5 pounds. He spent a month in intensive care. He received home visits through the first year of life to monitor his growth.  While he’s now a curious and vivacious 3-year-old who loves to explore the world around him, Angelica recalls those days in the ICU, and she feels guilty because she could not be with him.  “It’s scary to know I could have died, that we could have died,” Lyons said, wiping away tears. ___  For decades, frustrated birth advocates and medical professionals have tried to sound an alarm about the ways medicine has failed Black women. Historians trace that maltreatment to racist medical practices that Black people endured amid and after slavery.  To fully understand maternal mortality and infant mortality crises for Black women and babies, the nation must first reckon with the dark history of how gynecology began, said Deirdre Cooper Owens, a historian and author.  “The history of this particular medical branch … it begins on a slave farm in Alabama,” Owens said. “The advancement of obstetrics and gynecology had such an intimate relationship with slavery, and was literally built on the wounds of Black women.”  Reproductive surgeries that were experimental at the time, like cesarean sections, were commonly performed on enslaved Black women.  Physicians like the once-heralded J. Marion Sims, an Alabama doctor many call the “father of gynecology,” performed torturous surgical experiments on enslaved Black women in the 1840s without anesthesia.  And well after the abolition of slavery, hospitals performed unnecessary hysterectomies on Black women, and eugenics programs sterilized them.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd2h5eS5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZXMvYmxhY2stbWF0ZXJuYWwtaGVhbHRoLXByZWduYW5jeS1pbmVxdWFsaXR5L9IBSWh0dHBzOi8vd2h5eS5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZXMvYmxhY2stbWF0ZXJuYWwtaGVhbHRoLXByZWduYW5jeS1pbmVxdWFsaXR5L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The panel’s 14 advisers unanimously deemed the vaccine effective, while 10 out of 14 said the vaccine was safe. A study by Pfizer indicated that premature delivery was reported in 5.6% of pregnancies in the treatment group compared with 4.7% in the placebo group.  FDA officials said the difference was not statistically significant, but Pfizer said if the drug gets approved it would track health records for cases of preterm birth and other potential health issues. However, advisers expressed doubt about a plan to use health care billing records data to monitor safety.  CDC estimates that up to 80,000 children younger than age 5 years are hospitalized with RSV each year, and up to 300 die from RSV. The vaccine was tested in approximately 7,300 pregnant people after the 24th week of pregnancy, with about one-half receiving the vaccine and one-half receiving a placebo.  A recent study in NEJM found that during the first 90 days after birth, six infants in the vaccination group contracted a severe case of RSV compared with 33 in the placebo group, indicating an efficacy of almost 82%. For 6 months after birth, the vaccine was found to be 69% effective. During that time, there were 19 babies who became seriously ill in the treatment group compared with 62 in the placebo group.

(PTI Photo)  Digital, complete and accurate Census figures will have multidimensional benefits, and planning based on Census data ensures development reaches the poorest of the poor, he said.  “If the birth and death certificate data are preserved in a special way, development works can be planned properly. A Bill to link the death and birth register with electoral rolls will be introduced in Parliament. Under this process, when a person turns 18, his or her name will automatically be included in the electoral rolls. Similarly, when a person dies, that information automatically will go to the EC, which will start the process of deleting the name from the voters’ list. Earlier, the development process took place in fragments, because adequate data for development was not available,” he said.  “The registration of birth and death is very important for any country and it helps in making development plans between two Censuses.

"birth","2023-09-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T15:58:54","Rabbits are known for their rapid breeding cycles that result in many offspring each year. The phrase “breeding like rabbits” has become a common reference to people that have several babies in a short amount of time. Since they’re known for their reproductive prowess, it’s only fair to ask: when do rabbits have babies? Learn about the time of year when these mammals are most likely to give birth to their offspring.  What is the Gestation Period of Rabbits?  An eastern cottontail rabbit typically has a gestation period of 25 to 35 days. ©Rabbitti/Shutterstock.com  The gestation period of rabbits can vary depending on the species. Since the eastern cottontail is one of the most common species of rabbits in North America, we’ll focus on their gestation period.  Only The Top 1% Can Ace our Animal Quizzes Think You Can? Take Our Brand New A-Z-Animals Rabbit Quiz  Rabbits become sexually mature at a young age. Females become ready to breed between 6 and 8 months, but some may start breeding even younger. Male rabbits start breeding between 3 and 6 months of age. That’s one reason why people who own pet rabbits begin separating them based on sex while they’re young.  The average eastern cottontail rabbit’s gestation period is between 25 and 35 days. That allows the rabbits to reproduce very quickly. Female rabbits can become pregnant within hours of giving birth. By the time the new litter is born, the original litter would have become largely self-sufficient.  How Many Rabbits Are Born at a Time?  The number of rabbits born at a single time varies. Each litter will produce between 4 and 8 baby rabbits on average. However, each litter can include more offspring, upwards of 12. After the babies are born, they will open their eyes within 10 days and then leave the nest the mother has made between 3 and 5 weeks later.  The fast maturation of the baby rabbits has a benefit — the process allows the mother to make way for the next litter! These animals breed quickly, but they rarely overrun any given area. The sad fact is that only about 15% of the offspring live through their first year.  They are relentlessly hunted by other animals such as snakes, hawks, eagles, and coyotes. Sometimes, humans strike their nests with lawnmowers or strike them with vehicles on the road.  Even if they do live through their first year, the overall lifespan of an eastern cottontail rabbit is only about 15 months. That means the species benefits from producing many animals. Theoretically, many offspring means that a higher number of rabbits will be available to breed in the future.  On average, a breeding eastern cottontail rabbit will have between three and four litters per year. Given that each litter has 4 to 8 offspring, the average rabbit can have 12 to 32 babies! That’s a tremendous amount of breeding that exceeds most mammals.  What Time of Year Do Rabbits Have Babies?  Rabbits have babies throughout the spring, summer, and early autumn months.  Rabbits are typically born between March and September, with breeding sometimes starting in February leading to the first litter being born about a month later. Rabbits are like other animals that do not breed in the winter.  The energy expenditure required for breeding and caring for their young makes raising babies in winter impractical. After all, rabbit food sources are scarcer during the winter months, making it harder for the mother to feed the babies while staying fed.  During that time of year, some species of rabbits usually move into underground burrows to stay safe from the cold. However, eastern cottontails do not dig their burrows. Instead, they inhabit other animals’ burrows or find natural hollows in which to spend the winter.  Rabbits do not hibernate like bears, though. They are rather resistant to cold, so they can freely find whatever food is available in winter. Yet, they’re usually more concerned with staying concealed. After all, with less vegetation to hide in, they could become an easier target for some of their predators.  Where Do Rabbits Give Birth?  Eastern cottontail rabbits give birth in nests. ©Jerry Morse/Shutterstock.com  Rabbits tend to give birth in nests. Sometimes, the doe, the female rabbit, waits until the last week to start looking for a proper nesting site. Remember, eastern cottontails do not burrow into the ground. However, they will seek a low-lying area in which they can build a safe nest for their babies.  Usually, the nests are made from various soft grasses. The mother also lines the nest with her fur to insulate the area. After the mother has built the nest, the process of kindling will begin. Kindling is the rabbit’s birthing process, and it can take as few as 15 minutes!  Oftentimes, the rabbit will hold off on giving birth until nighttime or early morning. That is the time when the rabbits feel safest from predators. Once the baby rabbits, called kits, are born, the mother may cover them with more of her fur.  Many rabbits only nurse their babies for about 5 to 10 minutes per day. That’s all the time the babies need to get the milk required to help them grow. A few weeks later, the rabbits will be ready to take on the world on their own.  So, when do rabbits have babies? As often as they can between March and September even though breeding starts in February for some of the mammals. Rabbits give birth to a lot of babies in hopes that they make it to adulthood. Unfortunately, many of them do not. However, people can help baby rabbits flourish by keeping an eye out for nests in their yards and watching for them on the road.

"birth","2023-07-15","Not Discerned","{""Philadelphia"", ""Pennsylvania"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T09:30:00","A nonprofit collaborating with state agencies and lawmakers is trying to expand doula services. The goal is to reduce the state’s maternal mortality rate, especially in communities of color, where that rate tends to be higher.  Doulas, who are non-medical professionals who provide emotional, physical and educational support to patients during pregnancy, are not part of the state Medicaid network, which is the health insurance plan that many low-income people rely on.  The Pennsylvania Doula Commission, founded in 2021, wants to prepare doulas to eventually join the state Medicaid system. It is offering a scholarship to pay the $50 application fee for perinatal doula certifications.  While a perinatal doula certification is not required to practice as a doula, it sets a pathway to get Medicaid reimbursement, said Gerria Coffee, president of PADC. Certification could help create a standard for the state Department of Human Services to recognize doulas as providers.  “Very few organizations or doulas throughout Pennsylvania are actually working with managed care organizations,” Coffee said. “There are a few, but very few and not all doulas have received the education necessary or the support necessary to be able to fill out claims for reimbursement.”  Because of not being able to get reimbursements, doulas often do not make enough money to live off that profession, regardless of how many hours they spend with their patients. Doulas often pay for their own gas and supplies, so, in the end, their take-home pay is reduced. That is why some doulas approach the job as a “side hustle,” Coffee said.  Pennsylvania ranks 37th out of 50 in the United States for doula salaries, according to ZipRecruiter.  Sharee Lynn Livingston, an OB-GYN physician and co-founder of Diversifying Doulas in Lancaster County, said doula state certification could improve doula interaction with hospitals and doctors  “As long as we’re centering the doula, then it’s a win-win,” Livingston said. “I know that you can provide excellent doula care, without certification, without these name badges, if you will.”  But there are other ways of integrating doulas in the healthcare system. For example, a “fee-for- service” system.  “If there’s a patient that comes in who I think would benefit from a doula, then I know in the chart that this patient would benefit from doula care, and the insurance then pays a fee for service for that doula,” Livingston said.  PADC’s stipends come from the Jewish Healthcare Foundation, which is acting as a fiscal agent for federal Coronavirus State Fiscal Recovery Funds provided through the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services.  Earlier in the year, Democratic state House lawmakers pledged to address the state’s maternal mortality crisis. A 2022 report from the Pennsylvania Maternal Mortality Review Committee found the state has a pregnancy-associated mortality ratio (PAMR) of 82 deaths per 100,000 live births. Black women in the United States are three times more likely to die in childbirth, according to the CDC.  State Sen. Judy Schwank, D-Berks State and Rep. Morgan Cephas, D-Philadelphia re-introduced companions bills to extend Medicaid coverage to doulas.  Increased access to doulas is seen as one of the solutions for improving birth outcomes in the state. Multiple studies have shown that having a doula reduces the risk of maternal death. Patients who give birth with a doula are more likely to have a shorter labor, according to a report from the National Institutes of Health. Doula-assisted mothers were also less likely to have a baby born with a low birth rate.  Doulas also help patients with language barriers. The Pennsylvania Doula Commission will have an equity commission in July that will target bilingual doulas.  “Having someone, especially when you’re in a situation where you may not have that much family around, that’s speaking to you in your native tongue and that understands your needs culturally and is there with a mindset of providing and protecting you – that lowers stress levels and improves health outcomes, not just for the mother or birthing parent, but also for the baby,” Coffee said.

"birth","2022-05-08","17:00:00","{""RoyalOak"", ""Michigan"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T15:16:33","ROYAL OAK, Mich. – It’s been more than a year since a baby wallaby went missing from the Detroit Zoo, saddening the community that just celebrated its birth.  The Detroit Zoo announced the birth of a baby wallaby, known simply as “joey,” on May 6, 2022. It was 5 months old then.  Just hours later, zoo staff would see the baby joey for the last time.  On the morning of May 8, 2022, officials announced that the small wallaby was missing from the Australian Outback Adventure habitat at the Royal Oak-based zoo. Animal care staff reportedly last saw the joey at 5 p.m. the day before.  Zoo officials said staff worked to find the missing wallaby, exhausting all options available to find the baby.  As the days passed, concern grew due to the joey’s age: Baby wallabies crawl into their mother’s pouch immediately after birth, where they continue to develop. Because the 5-month-old was still nursing and spending time in its mother’s pouch, zoo officials said it was unlikely that the joey could “survive an extended amount of time away from the mother.”  After days of searching and investigating, the zoo called off the search on May 13, 2022. Officials found that the joey couldn’t have escaped from its enclosure, and that it was unlikely it was taken by a visitor.  It was believed that a hawk or an owl may have taken the baby wallaby from its enclosure, since those natural predators live near the zoo, officials said. At that point, the joey was not believed to be alive.  But on May 20, a small glimmer of hope stretched across Metro Detroit, after a viewer sent in a photo of what they thought could be the missing wallaby. The details weren’t entirely promising -- the viewer was from Washington Township, and the animal looked more like a squirrel than anything else -- but we reached out to the zoo, just in case.  Photo of animal on roof in Washington Township from viewer Margaret S. (Margaret S)  We quickly heard back from a zoo spokesperson, who had also received and examined the viewer’s photo. The spokesperson told us that the zoo’s life sciences team did, indeed, identify the animal in the photo as a gray squirrel -- not a wallaby.  Why the squirrel was missing fur and looked unwell is a mystery, but it could have been affected by something like mange.  Unfortunately, that glimmer of hope lasted only for a moment.  Squirrel vs. wallaby. (WDIV)  After the photo was submitted, there weren’t any other leads in the case of the missing wallaby. It is still believed that the joey was taken by a flying predator and did not survive.  The joey was so young when it went missing that its gender had yet to be determined. With “heavy hearts,” the zoo called off the search and closed the case after exhausting “every resource” at its disposal.  “It is with heavy hearts that we announce we are ceasing our search for the wallaby joey who was discovered missing on Sunday, May 8. “We have exhausted every resource at our disposal, spent dozens of hours reviewing all trail cam and security footage, and thoroughly searched the Zoo and surrounding areas. We are heartbroken that nothing has revealed to us the location of this wallaby. At this point, after so many days away from the mother, we do not believe this joey could still be alive. “The Detroit Zoo is a leader in animal welfare, widely known for spacious, naturalistic habitats that mimic what an animal might see in the wild. However, when tragedies like this occur, we must review and revisit our policies and procedures to ensure we are doing everything possible to preserve the life and welfare of the animals in our care. Our leadership team is currently undergoing this process. “All of us at the Detroit Zoo mourn the loss of this joey, but we take solace in knowing that the mother wallaby, 4-year-old Sprocket, appears to be healthy and doing well. Animal care staff continues to provide her — and every animal at the Zoo — with the highest level of care. “Thank you to everyone who followed the search for this joey and offered support. We are devastated this story did not have a happy ending.” The Detroit Zoo via Facebook  Wallaby and joey at Detroit Zoo.

Out of 3,664,292 U.S. births in 2021, the number of women who perished during pregnancy or within 42 days of giving birth reached 1,205. That was 40% higher than the 2020 rate.  For every 100,000 live births in 2021, America lost 32.9 mothers, compared to 23.8 mothers in 2020, based on data from the National Vital Statistics System.    With some states curbing access to abortions, even for potentially lethal pregnancy complications, death rates may rise even more soon. Other concerns include an increasing number of shuttered rural maternity wards and any potential limits to Medicaid, upon which some pregnant women depend for healthcare costs.  America's 2021 rate was more than 10 times the 2020 maternal mortality death rates in Australia, Austria, Israel, Spain and Japan. In those countries, from 2 to 3 mothers out of every 100,000 died in childbirth, according to the World Health Organization.  The death rate was higher among all countries deemed high-income, with 12 deaths per 100,000 live births, WHO says. But that rate was still less than half of the 32.9 deaths per 100,000 in the U.S.  Of all American maternal deaths in 2021, 84%were preventable, the CDC says.  One cause was the choice of some soon-to-be moms to refuse to get vaccinated against COVID-19, despite research clearly showing that they were among the most at risk of dying.  But COVID-19 wasn't the sole factor in 2021 for maternal mortality during pregnancy, during childbirth or shortly after childbirth. Racial background also was highly associated, as CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics shows.    For every 100,000 live births in 2021, there were 69.9 maternal deaths for Black women, compared with 28 among Latino women and 26.6 for White women.  Other risk factors include obesity, type 2 diabetes and preeclampsia.  Once babies are born, women may suffer post-birth bleeding, postpartum depression, substance abuse or, for new black mothers, a climb in cardiac deaths, the CDC says.  With some states curbing access to abortions, even for potentially lethal pregnancy complications, death rates may rise even more soon.

Advertisement Montana governor signs law to define 'sex' as only male or female Opponents say such laws would block transgender residents from changing the sex on their birth certificates or driver's licenses to match their identity. Share Copy Link Copy  Republican Governor Greg Gianforte has signed a bill defining the word ""sex"" in state law as only male or female — joining Kansas and Tennessee, which have similar laws that LGBTQ+ advocates argue will deny legal recognition to nonbinary and transgender people.Video above: Restricting transgender rights now a focal point in GOP politicsMedical professionals say the laws also ignore that some people are born as intersex — a term that encompasses about 60 conditions in which a person is born with genitalia, reproductive organs, chromosomes and/or hormone levels that don't fit typical definitions of male or female.The sponsor of the bill said the change is needed to clarify from a legal standpoint that ""sex"" and ""gender"" don't mean the same thing.The Montana bill ""is an attempt to erase trans, nonbinary and two-spirit people from the code, thereby removing the rights, privileges and considerations that trans, nonbinary and Two Spirit people would have under the law,"" said SK Rossi last month, testifying against the legislation on behalf of the Human Rights Campaign.""Two-spirit"" is a Native American term for people with both male and female spirits.The bill, which Gianforte signed on Friday, was approved during a legislative session that also passed a ban on gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors and saw transgender lawmaker Democratic Rep. Zooey Zephyr expelled from the House floor, following a protest against Republican lawmakers who had silenced her.Other states have or are considering adopting similar legislation to Montana's, to define ""sex,"" which would block residents from changing the identifying labels on their birth certificates and driver's licenses. Laws in Kansas and Tennessee are scheduled to take effect on July 1, while Montana's would take effect on Oct. 1.Transgender people opt to change the sex on their birth certificates and driver's licenses so their documentation matches their identity.Lauren Wilson, president of the Montana chapter of the American Academy of Pediatricians, said the bill's assertion that there are exactly two sexes isn't true from a medical standpoint.The bill defines female as having XX chromosomes, and a reproductive and endocrine system that produces or would produce ova, or eggs. Male is defined as having XY chromosomes and a biological system that produces or would produce sperm.The bill was amended to say that anyone who would fall under the definition of either male or female, ""but for a biological or genetic condition,"" would fall under the initial determination of male or female.""The amendment added to address intersex people actually makes the bill more inaccurate as well,"" Wilson said.A bill before the Texas legislature was amended to allow a delay in reporting the biological sex of a child if it could not be determined at birth.The Montana bill ""has no basis in science and seeks to reduce every single one of our existences to our reproductive capacity,"" argued Keegan Medrano, the policy director for the ACLU of Montana.The bill's sponsor, Republican Sen. Carl Glimm, said the legislation was necessary after a 2022 court ruling in which a state judge said transgender residents could change the gender markers on their birth certificates. That ruling — which conflated sex with gender — blocked a bill sponsored by Glimm the previous year that would have only allowed a birth certificate change if the person had undergone a gender-affirming surgical procedure.Montana's health department later passed a rule saying that no changes could be made to the listed sex on a resident's birth certificate unless it was incorrectly recorded due to a transcription error.A person's biological sex cannot be changed, Glimm argued, in presenting his bill to the House Judiciary Committee last month.""You may claim to be able to change your gender or express your gender in a different way, but you can never change your biological sex,"" he said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhcHQuY29tL2FydGljbGUvbW9udGFuYS1sYXctdG8tZGVmaW5lLXNleC1hcy1vbmx5LW1hbGUtZmVtYWxlLzQzOTY4NzI40gFXaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FwdC5jb20vYW1wL2FydGljbGUvbW9udGFuYS1sYXctdG8tZGVmaW5lLXNleC1hcy1vbmx5LW1hbGUtZmVtYWxlLzQzOTY4NzI4?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Daily transactions have rocketed to an all-time high of 682,000 this month, according to data from Glassnode, almost 40% higher than the previous peak in 2017. Bitcoin's dominance, or its share of the overall $1.16 trillion cryptocurrency market, has swelled to 44% from 38% at the start of the year.  What's going on?  Enter BRC-20, the first class of crypto tokens to be built on the bitcoin blockchain, besides bitcoin itself. Nearly 25,000 of the experimental coins have already been minted this year, sending transactions through the roof.  ""BRC-20 tokens are a phenomenon we haven't seen before,"" said Gordon Grant, co-head of trading at Genesis trading.  Primarily due to the creation of these tokens, the average daily transactions over seven days stands at more than 531,000, nearly twice as high as a month ago, according to Blockchain.com data.  This new class of crypto has no specific use beyond speculation, akin to memecoins. Yet its nascent popularity points to interest in bitcoin not just as a store of value or payments method, but as the foundation for developing new coins and applications - previously considered the domain of more modern blockchains such as Ethereum and Solana.  Some investors and developers view bitcoin's blockchain as a safer long-term basis for creating tokens and applications in the wake of the crypto carnage that followed the collapse of high-profile firms like FTX and a general flight from riskier assets, according to market players.  ""People have seen what is possible with other blockchains and they want it on bitcoin, as the oldest network, bitcoin has a track record that people can trust,"" said Alex Miller, CEO at bitcoin developer network Hiro.  Still, the BRC-20 frenzy has been volatile.  The total value of these tokens - which are typically traded in secondary markets, particularly decentralized exchanges - exceeded $1 billion in early May, but has since fallen back to $446 million, according to tracker BRC-20.io.  INSCRIBED ON SATOSHI  As bitcoin's blockchain wasn't originally developed to support a crypto ecosystem, unlike Ethereum and Solana, BRC-20 tokens are created using ordinals theory, which allows data to be inscribed on each satoshi - the smallest denomination of bitcoin, or one hundred millionth.  ""There isn't much utility when it comes to BRC-20 tokens and Ordinals,"" said CJ Reim, contributor at blockchain firm CoreDAO, though he sees the trend as ""promising"" in terms of interest in building products on the bitcoin blockchain.  The race to create these new coins hasn't had a significant impact on the price of bitcoin, which has been trading under $30,000 since mid-April.  The rapid creation of BRC-20 tokens hasn't been without contention, with detractors saying the issuance of these tokens has made it more difficult for users who want to use bitcoin for its originally intended purposes.  ""Gas"" fees, or transactions costs on the bitcoin blockchain have soared over the past month, with the total dollar-denominated fees paid per day touching near a new all-time-high of $17.8 million per day, according to Glassnode data.  The median transaction fee spiked as high as $30.91 versus a range of 90 cents and $4.23 between January and May 1, Blockchain.com data showed.  The network has also slowed considerably. The congestion was so acute, that the world's largest crypto exchange Binance had to briefly pause bitcoin withdrawals on May 7.

"birth","2023-04-15","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T13:52:30","I was one of five children — not seen as a particularly big family in Newfoundland at the time — and there was one year when we allegedly beat Guatemala to have the highest birth rate in the world. (That’s probably not true, but people were proud of it anyway.) Then we joined Canada in 1949, and got access to what Newfoundlanders called the “Baby Bonus.”  The “family allowance,” as Canadians called it, was a serious amount of untaxed cash on the table for a great many families, for Newfoundland was then probably the poorest place north of Mexico. In fact, many believe the Baby Bonus was the main reason Newfoundland voted to join Canada.  You would have expected the birth rate to go even higher after that, because children meant cash. But instead the birth rate started to fall, slowly at first, and then faster.  Girls got better educations, women had more choices, and people moved to the bigger towns and the one large city. By now the average woman in Newfoundland has only 1.36 children in a lifetime, and the population is falling steadily.  So I wouldn’t hold out much hope for China, Japan and most European countries to stop the steep fall in their populations with cash bribes either. It doesn’t work that way.  Leading the way are South Korea, Japan, Spain and Italy, all of which will see their populations fall by more than half in this century. China is just getting started, with a fall of almost one million in its population announced in January, but it will also end up dropping by half by the end of the century: from 1.41 billion now to only 732 million in 2100.  The pro-natality strategies are now far more sophisticated than just a flat-rate Baby Bonus. They include big lump-sum payments for new parents, free education, subsidized daycare programmes for working mothers, tax incentives and expanded parental leave — but nothing works.  In February, Japan declared it will double the country’s child-rearing subsidies to four per cent of GDP —$150 billion a year — but even that’s unlikely to get the birth rate up. The only way to keep the population stable or even growing in a developed country is mass immigration — which means you have to be attractive and welcoming to potential immigrants.  The English-speaking countries do that best. Canada, with 40 million people, is the world leader in proportional terms, bringing in another half-million a year. Australia is doing almost as well, and the United Kingdom, New Zealand and the United States are all managing around half that rate.  The great benefit they get from doing this is that they keep the ratio of younger people in the workforce to dependent older people high enough to afford a state that takes care of all its people. So why don’t all the other industrialized countries, including China, Korea and Japan, do the same?  They will probably have to, in the end, but they have no long experience of multi-ethnic cultures and they’re anxious about losing their “identity.” It’s nonsense: second-generation immigrants almost invariably adopt the language and culture of the country they were born in. But don’t expect the average Chinese, Norwegian or Turk to believe that yet.  Where will the mass immigration come from? Mostly from Africa, the one continent whose population will go on growing rapidly until the 2060s — by which time Africans will probably account for about a third of the world’s population.  That high population growth rate will keep a great many Africans poor, but they will be in high demand elsewhere as potential immigrants. Even the East Asian countries will have to swallow their racism and open their doors, or their economies will wither for lack of people to fill the jobs and care for the elderly.

"birth","2023-03-29","Not Discerned","{""Washington"", ""DistrictOfColumbia"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T13:03:52","When people have access to comprehensive, inclusive, and high-quality contraceptive care and family planning services, they have more individual, social, political, and economic power. Birth control is a vital and essential public health service. Access to contraception and high-quality contraceptive care has wide-ranging and far-reaching implications for women’s rights and advancement as well as the potential to improve women’s quality of life. A plethora of research demonstrates that, with improved access to contraception, women have greater educational attainment, increased workforce participation, and higher incomes. In fact, after all women gained the constitutional right to birth control in 1972 under the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Eisenstadt v. Baird, there was a massive shift and surge in women’s professional workforce and social participation. This is, in part, because birth control afforded women more reproductive autonomy and supported their ability to make decisions about their own bodies. Furthermore, research demonstrates that access to contraception and family planning services improves maternal and childhood outcomes for those who do decide to have children.  This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.  Unfortunately, however, many systemic barriers stand in the way of better contraceptive care. Although policymakers and advocates have been pushing for changes that reflect the evolving needs of women and people of all genders, the United States is still behind many other countries in terms of quality contraceptive care and access to birth control. Furthermore, the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade spurred a renewed sense of urgency and an imperative for states to ensure equitable access to contraception in the absence of federal protections for abortion. Below are six guiding principles that state lawmakers should consider when developing policies and measures to support access to birth control and improve contraceptive care and family planning services. While this list is not exhaustive, these principles can create the foundation for advancing contraceptive care and guide support for people’s family planning goals, wants, and needs. On March 29, 2023, the Women’s Initiative of the Center for American Progress hosted a panel discussion on equitable access to contraception. This discussion informed the development of these six principles, and the author includes in this article quotes from the experts who participated.  Watch the event Toward a Collective Vision for Improving Contraceptive Access Past Event Mar 29 Toward a Collective Vision for Improving Contraceptive Access Online only  2:00 - 3:00 PM EDT  1. Contraceptive care should be nondiscriminatory, equity-driven, and coercion-free First and foremost, access to high-quality contraceptive care should not be dependent on a person’s social identities or characteristics, including but not limited to their race, gender, age, sexual identity, geographic location, disability status, nationality, income, or wealth. It should be nondiscriminatory and equity-driven. Often, however, the most marginalized communities are systemically excluded from accessing the sexual and reproductive health services, supports, and resources they need. This exclusion is compounded by the United States’ complex and racist history of unethical practices against women of color. During the eugenics movement of the 1900s, many women of color, especially Black, Latina, and Indigenous women, were forcibly and coercively sterilized. The attacks on the reproductive freedoms of these women attempted to reduce the populations of their communities; over the course of the 20th century, nearly 70,000 people were forcibly sterilized. Evidence of this medical racism also exists in the decades of biomedical and pharmacological clinical trials and experimentation conducted on people of color, most of whom were low-income patients. Event panelist Kim Diaz Scott, who serves as the vice president of policy and communications at the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association, discussed the importance of making contraception available to everyone without the threat of coercion: Equitable access for contraception is affordability, coverage, and also accessibility, which means the consideration for the ability to educate and counsel on the full range of contraceptive methods, not just what is hand-picked and chosen by the government. It means considerations for streamlining the process to access birth control … and how can we make birth control accessible to all communities. [I] also want to recognize it also means accessing contraception free of coercion. Our country has a long history of reproductive coercion, and so the right to make personal decisions about contraceptive use [that are] free of coercion is important for all, especially for those that are historically marginalized groups.  Our country has a long history of reproductive coercion, and so the right to make personal decisions about contraceptive use [that are] free of coercion is important for all. – Kim Diaz Scott, vice president of policy and communications, National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association  A health care system that does not support and center the most marginalized individuals is failing at and falling short of its core mission. Any proposed policy reforms and initiatives geared at improving access to contraception—as well as research into new methods—must confront this history while centering the communities who are most harmed and affected. Policies must also work to dismantle ongoing disparities in and threats to women’s health and uplift equitable changes in care. Amy Fan, co-founder, president, and chief product officer of Twentyeight Health, spoke at the CAP event about some of the barriers that must be dismantled: The average wait time for a primary care physician to see a new patient is over four weeks, and that’s even longer for an OB-GYN. So what we see is that, at every step of the process, there are barriers across the board for all women in the U.S. that are even higher for underserved communities. And then when we think beyond that, of how do you physically get to the clinic, what we often see is that for low-income patients, they most often cite that the lack of affordable transportation and inability to take time off of school or work as significant barriers to actually getting to that doctor’s office.  The average wait time for a primary care physician to see a new patient is over four weeks, and that’s even longer for an OB-GYN. – Amy Fan, co-founder, president, and chief product officer, Twentyeight Health  2. Contraceptive care should empower and affirm women in their family planning journeys Women’s decision to use birth control is often driven by their desire to prevent pregnancy—and research demonstrates that women want to prevent pregnancy for a variety of reasons: concerns about the physical stress or emotional toll; challenges to personal finances; concerns about education and employment; and strain on intimate and personal relationships as well as, generally, for reasons related to personal well-being. No matter the reason for seeking contraceptive care, health care providers should work with patients to empower and affirm their reproductive decision-making and provide the resources and tools they need to succeed. Providers should advise patients of the full range of Food and Drug Administration-approved, -cleared, and -granted birth control methods in a nonjudgmental, noncoercive way that affirms their autonomy and reproductive decision-making power, as well as prioritize patients’ preferences and unique needs.  Learn more about person-centered contraceptive care  3. Contraceptive care should emphasize and ensure quality Quality is a particularly important factor of sexual and reproductive health care that has long-lasting and wide-ranging influence on people’s health outcomes. High-quality care is associated with increases in continued contraceptive use and decreases in unplanned pregnancies. Quality of care is a multipronged issue, and a number of factors, taken together, can make the difference between poor or high-quality care. These include the quality and accuracy of contraceptive information; the availability of effective counseling on the range of options available, such as on dual-method contraceptive use; providers’ abilities to meet patients where they are and meet their needs; the availability of technology and supplies; and whether there is mutual respect between patients and providers. Additionally, it is necessary for researchers and medical professionals to maintain the momentum toward improving and increasing the contraceptive options available. 4. Contraceptive care must include safeguards for privacy and confidentiality A core tenet of care should be protecting patients’ privacy and confidentiality at every stage. According to the American Medical Association, privacy encompasses personal space, personal data, personal decision-making and choices, and personal relationships. In general, health care providers have a professional and ethical obligation to protect patients’ sensitive and intimate health information through the HIPAA privacy rule and other institutional rules. Although consideration for patient privacy and confidentiality is not new, the current political climate has brought heightened attention to the issue, as many states punish and criminalize abortion providers and others who provide reproductive health care. Moreover, technological advancements such as telehealth during the past few years have shone a new spotlight and refocused efforts on patient privacy. Telehealth providers in particular must be forthcoming about how patient data are stored and can be accessed. 5. Contraceptive care must prioritize safety and efficacy in concert with patient needs It is important that contraceptive care is evidence-based and medically accurate. Providers must receive ongoing training and adequate support so that they are able to offer comprehensive, complete, informed, and inclusive information to their patients, and they must keep up to date on the safety and efficacy of the full range of contraceptive methods. To respect and honor individuals’ autonomy and reproductive freedom, any discussion of safety and efficacy must also value choice. Many people seeking contraception rank “safety and efficacy” high on their lists of priorities, but they rank other sexual-related priorities high as well. Thus, it is imperative that conversations of safety and efficacy are informed by the context of people’s personal lives, experiences, and preferences. 6. Contraceptive care should be easily accessible and available Finally, an essential part of advancing and improving contraceptive care is ensuring that contraception is easily accessible and available to all. As Tara Mancini, director of public policy at Power to Decide, noted at the CAP event: There’s 19 million women living in contraceptive deserts, and we know that the greatest barriers fall disproportionately on LGBTQIA populations, people in rural areas, women of color, and young people, of course, as well. … Don’t provide recommendations without consulting the people who are most impacted.  Don’t provide recommendations without consulting the people who are most impacted. – Tara Mancini, director of public policy, Power to Decide","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtZXJpY2FucHJvZ3Jlc3Mub3JnL2FydGljbGUvNi1wcmluY2lwbGVzLXRvLXN1cHBvcnQtY29tcHJlaGVuc2l2ZS1jb250cmFjZXB0aXZlLWNhcmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Texas lawmakers are pushing to reduce those challenges with a new law that would expand Medicaid coverage for up to 12 months for new moms.  Under current state law, new moms on Medicaid receive two months of post-partum health care.  ""Often times that recovery period for a mom is going to be a little longer. Eight weeks out from the birth of a child, they're still considering if they are experiencing any post-partum depression, or if they're experiencing any other physical health concerns,"" Deputy Director of The Purple Door Kellie Addison said.  Addison dedicates her time to helping women who suffer from abuse, including those who have just given birth. She says an extra ten months of coverage makes a difference.  ""They can be okay now, but what happens after the third, fourth, and sixth months out after the birth of a child? There's so much that the mom is learning about herself, like how her body is responding after birth and the other stress that comes after having a child.""If we can make sure mom is healthy, then there will be an opportunity for the baby to be healthy,"" Addison said.  Initially, the Texas House voted on a bill that would start the extended coverage on the last day of the Medicaid recipient's pregnancy.  However, when the bill reached the Senate, senate lawmakers added a last-minute change. That change stated that women who terminated their pregnancy would not be eligible for extended medical coverage.  The new proposal is heading back to the House for a vote soon.

(Thom Bridge/Independent Record via AP, File)  HELENA, Mont. (AP) — Republican Governor Greg Gianforte has signed a bill defining the word “sex” in state law as only male or female — joining Kansas and Tennessee, which have similar laws that LGBTQ+ advocates argue will deny legal recognition to nonbinary and transgender people.  Medical professionals say the laws also ignore that some people are born as intersex — a term that encompasses about 60 conditions in which a person is born with genitalia, reproductive organs, chromosomes and/or hormone levels that don’t fit typical definitions of male or female.  The sponsor of the bill said the change is needed to clarify from a legal standpoint that “sex” and “gender” don’t mean the same thing.  The Montana bill “is an attempt to erase trans, nonbinary and two-spirit people from the code, thereby removing the rights, privileges and considerations that trans, nonbinary and Two Spirit people would have under the law,” said SK Rossi last month, testifying against the legislation on behalf of the Human Rights Campaign.  “Two-spirit” is a Native American term for people with both male and female spirits.  The bill, which Gianforte signed on Friday, was approved during a legislative session that also passed a ban on gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors and saw transgender lawmaker Democratic Rep. Zooey Zephyr expelled from the House floor , following a protest against Republican lawmakers who had silenced her.  Other states have or are considering adopting similar legislation to Montana’s, to define “sex ,” which would block residents from changing the identifying labels on their birth certificates and driver’s licenses. Laws in Kansas and Tennessee are scheduled to take effect on July 1, while Montana’s would take effect on Oct. 1.  Transgender people opt to change the sex on their birth certificates and driver’s licenses so their documentation matches their identity.  Lauren Wilson, president of the Montana chapter of the American Academy of Pediatricians, said the bill’s assertion that there are exactly two sexes isn’t true from a medical standpoint.  The bill defines female as having XX chromosomes, and a reproductive and endocrine system that produces or would produce ova, or eggs. Male is defined as having XY chromosomes and a biological system that produces or would produce sperm.  The bill was amended to say that anyone who would fall under the definition of either male or female, “but for a biological or genetic condition,” would fall under the initial determination of male or female.  “The amendment added to address intersex people actually makes the bill more inaccurate as well,” Wilson said.  A bill before the Texas legislature was amended to allow a delay in reporting the biological sex of a child if it could not be determined at birth.  The Montana bill “has no basis in science and seeks to reduce every single one of our existences to our reproductive capacity,” argued Keegan Medrano, the policy director for the ACLU of Montana.  The bill’s sponsor, Republican Sen. Carl Glimm, said the legislation was necessary after a 2022 court ruling in which a state judge said transgender residents could change the gender markers on their birth certificates . That ruling — which conflated sex with gender — blocked a bill sponsored by Glimm the previous year that would have only allowed a birth certificate change if the person had undergone a gender-affirming surgical procedure.  Montana’s health department later passed a rule saying that no changes could be made to the listed sex on a resident’s birth certificate unless it was incorrectly recorded due to a transcription error.  A person’s biological sex cannot be changed, Glimm argued, in presenting his bill to the House Judiciary Committee last month.  “You may claim to be able to change your gender or express your gender in a different way, but you can never change your biological sex,” he said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3RyYW5zZ2VuZGVyLWJpcnRoLWNlcnRpZmljYXRlLWRlZmluZS1zZXgtbWFsZS1mZW1hbGUtZTE3ZTVlYWUzNjk5MWY4Y2ExZDE5N2RkZWJhZDBiNzLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

These days, there’s not even an ultrasound machine in this rural county 60 miles south of Columbia, much less an obstetrician. Pregnant women here are left with few options for care.  Federally qualified health centers offer prenatal services in nearby Fairfax and Barnwell, but only when a pregnancy is uncomplicated and only through about 34 weeks of gestation.  During the final weeks of pregnancy, women must transfer their care to the nearest obstetrician, often in Orangeburg, which can be 20 miles away or more, depending on where they live in Bamberg County. Some women travel farther to hospitals in Aiken or Beaufort, where health outcomes are better.  “Most of our women are driving an hour or more from their homes to an OB provider,” said Tracy Golden, a doula and senior program manager for the South Carolina Office of Rural Health.  Although the regional hospital in the city of Orangeburg delivers babies, the birth outcomes in the county are awful by any standard. In 2021, nearly 3% of all Black infants in Orangeburg County died before their 1st birthday.  Nationally, the average is about 1% for Black infants and less than 0.5% for white infants.  Meanwhile, Orangeburg County’s infant mortality rate for babies of all races is the highest in South Carolina, according to the latest data published by the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control.  By 2030, the federal government wants infant mortality to fall to 5 or fewer deaths per 1,000 live births. According to annual data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 16 states have already met or surpassed that goal, including Nevada, New York, and California. But none of those states are in the South, where infant mortality is by far the highest in the country, with Mississippi’s rate of 8.12 deaths per 1,000 live births ranking worst.  Even in those few Southern states where infant mortality rates are inching closer to the national average, the gap between death rates of Black and white babies is vast. In Florida and North Carolina, for example, the Black infant mortality rate is more than twice as high as it is for white babies. A new study published in JAMA found that over two decades Black people in the U.S. experienced more than 1.6 million excess deaths and 80 million years of life lost because of increased mortality risk relative to white Americans. The study also found that infants and older Black Americans bear the brunt of excess deaths and years lost.  That makes Black infant mortality in the South a complex regional crisis that should alarm everyone, not just future parents, said Georgina Dukes-Harris, senior director for social care at Unite Us, a national technology company focused on societal needs. Birth outcomes for mothers and infants are a leading indicator of population well-being and they run much deeper than health care: They reflect politics. They’re a direct product of generational poverty and racism. They reveal our priorities, Dukes-Harris said.  Often, babies die under circumstances that states, communities, and parents can help control, like making sure infants don’t suffocate in beds or in unsafe cribs, or extending health coverage so that young women can afford to see a doctor before they become pregnant. In many of these respects, the South is failing.  “This is something that has to change,” Dukes-Harris said.  ‘An Urgent Problem’ With No Easy Solution  Public health officials are still trying to parse the long-term impact of the covid-19 pandemic, but infant death rates in South Carolina were higher than the national average long before the health care landscape changed in 2020. And a report published by the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control in April shows the rate for non-Hispanic Black babies — who died at a rate nearly 2½ times that of non-Hispanic white infants in South Carolina in 2021 — is growing worse. The death rate among infants born to Black mothers in the state increased by nearly 40% from 2017 to 2021.  “That’s just not acceptable,” said Edward Simmer, director of the South Carolina health department. “It’s absolutely an urgent problem to me.”  It’s a problem, though, without an apparent solution. Multimillion-dollar programs to improve South Carolina’s numbers over the past decade have failed to move the needle. To make things more complicated, separate state agencies have reached different conclusions about the leading cause of infant death.  The state Department of Health and Human Services — which administers Medicaid, the health coverage program for low-income residents, and pays for more than half of all births in South Carolina — claims accidental deaths were the No. 1 reason babies covered by Medicaid died from 2016 to 2021, according to Medicaid spokesperson Jeff Leieritz.  But the state health department, where all infant death data is housed, reported birth defects as the top cause for the past several years. Accidental deaths ranked fifth among all causes in 2021, according to the 2021 health department report. All but one of those accidental infant deaths were attributed to suffocation or strangulation in bed.  Meanwhile, infant mortality is a topic that continues to get little, if any, attention, especially in the South.  A group called the South Carolina Birth Outcomes Initiative meets regularly to talk strategy, but this consortium of the state’s top doctors, nurses, health insurers, and hospital leaders can’t solve fundamental problems, like teaching parents safe sleep habits or connecting all pregnant women to basic prenatal care. According to the Medicaid agency, nearly half of Medicaid-enrolled babies who died before their 1st birthday in 2021 were born to mothers who received no prenatal care.  “There’s good work going on. It’s just in little patches. It’s just not spread out enough to change our overall numbers,” said Rick Foster, a retired physician and former chairman of one of the Birth Outcomes Initiative’s working groups.  Expanding Access to Maternal Care  South Carolina and several other states recently extended postpartum Medicaid coverage for women who give birth, which means their coverage remains in place for one year after delivery. Historically, Medicaid coverage was cut off 60 days after having a baby.  Some experts believe expanding Medicaid coverage to single, working adults who aren’t pregnant and don’t have children — something most Southern states have failed to do — would also help curtail infant deaths. A woman who is healthy when heading into pregnancy is more likely to give birth to a healthy baby because the health of the mother correlates to the health of the infant. But many women don’t qualify for Medicaid coverage until they become pregnant.  Even when they become pregnant and are newly eligible for Medicaid, it isn’t unusual for women in South Carolina to put off seeing a doctor until the third trimester, physicians told KFF Health News. These women can’t afford to take time off work, can’t find child care, or don’t have a car, among other reasons.  Telehealth could improve access if the state’s broadband network were better, said Simmer, the state health department director. The department could also invest in a fleet of mobile vans that provide prenatal care. Each costs just under $1 million, he said. Ultimately, South Carolina needs more doctors willing to practice in rural areas. Fourteen of its 46 counties lack a single OB-GYN, Simmer said.  “We don’t have providers where we need them,” he said. To that end, he added, the state might consider using student loan forgiveness programs as an incentive for new medical school graduates to practice in rural areas of the state, where obstetricians are scarce. Meanwhile, two programs aimed at improving infant mortality in South Carolina, which were backed by millions of dollars in public and private funding over the past decade, were unsuccessful in hitting the goal.  The Nurse-Family Partnership, for example, which pairs expectant South Carolina mothers with nurses for at-home visits, didn’t have a statistically significant effect on birth outcomes, according to an analysis of the multiyear project, published by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.  CenteringPregnancy, a separate program that offers small-group prenatal education to pregnant women, also failed to improve birth outcomes, said Amy Crockett, a maternal-fetal specialist in Greenville and one of the lead investigators for the state initiative.  Crockett said she recently returned about $300,000 in grant funding to the Duke Endowment, a nonprofit that funds health, faith, and education initiatives in the Carolinas, because the evidence to support ongoing CenteringPregnancy projects simply wasn’t there.  “It’s not the silver bullet we thought it would be,” Crockett said. “It’s time to move on.”  Birth outcomes experts agreed that racism and poverty lie at the heart of this difficult problem, which disproportionately threatens Black infants and mothers in the rural South. Research shows that white doctors are often prejudiced against Black patients and minimize their concerns and pain.  In South Carolina, the maternal mortality rate increased by nearly 10% from 2018 to 2019, according to the latest data, which found that the risk of pregnancy-related death for Black mothers was 67% higher than for white mothers. Upon review, the state health department determined 80% of those pregnancy-related deaths were preventable.  Disparities related to both infant and maternal deaths deserve urgent attention from both the federal and state governments, said Scott Sullivan, division chief of maternal-fetal medicine at Inova Health System in Northern Virginia. Hospitals also bear a huge responsibility as doctors and health care providers must learn how to fairly and adequately take care of Black women and children.  “The idea that we’re going to solve 400 years of racism in an hour’s worth of bias training is a cruel joke. Systems have to remodel their approach,” Sullivan said. “It’s going to take funding, and it’s going to take a sustained effort.”  KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF—an independent source of health policy research, polling, and journalism.

"birth","2023-10-12","Not Discerned","{""Minneapolis"", ""Minnesota"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T00:40:08","Minnesota passed a paid leave program earlier today. This is the thirteenth time Democrats have passed one of these programs on the state level, and every single one of them is designed specifically to exclude from eligibility a large minority of new mothers, especially the poor. Minnesota had a chance to break from this mold, but the same advocates who delivered the other garbage programs delivered yet another one.  In other countries, parental leave programs are commonly designed such that all new parents receive a cash benefit equal to some percentage of their prior earnings or some minimum amount, whichever is greater in their case. But Minnesota’s plan has no minimum benefit and entirely excludes all new parents who did not earn $3,500 in the twelve months leading up to birth.  According to the latest American Community Survey data, 22 percent of Minnesota women between the ages of eighteen and forty-five do not satisfy this work-history requirement. Individuals who are not likely to satisfy the requirement include students, disabled people, and those facing an unluckily timed spell of unemployment.  Here is how the Minnesota work-history requirement stacks up against other states with similar programs.  State Work History Needed in Prior Year CA Earn $300 CO Earn $2,500 CT Earn $2,325 in Highest Quarter DE Work 1,250 Hours MA Earn $6,000 MN Earn $3,500 MD Work 680 Hours NJ Earn $12,000 or Work 20 Weeks & Earn $4,800 NY Work 26 Weeks at 20 Hours Per Week or Work 175 Days OR Work 25 Hours Per Week for 180 Days RI Work 52 Weeks at 30 Hours Per Week WA Work 820 Hours  It would be trivially easy to fix this problem. Adding a single paragraph to the statute that said that any new parent who is not otherwise eligible for the earnings-related benefit will instead be eligible for a minimum benefit would get the job done. But paid-leave advocates flatly do not care about these exclusions. I know this because I have talked to many of them over the years, asking them about this problem, asking them if they’d help to resolve it, especially in states that are on the cusp of passing legislation, and the answer, after some hemming and hawing, is always no.  In a way, there is something to admire in the naked class politics of it all. Professional-class advocates are securing benefits for themselves and could not care less if other kinds of people are left out.  But others really should care about the parents and kids left out in the cold by these regimes. They need money to help keep them afloat while they care for their newborns just as much as professional class parents do. In fact, in most cases, they need it more.  There is also something a little bit perverse about a nominally contributory social insurance scheme that excludes from eligibility many of those who contribute to the scheme. Just because someone did not earn $3,500 in the twelve months immediately preceding a birth does not mean that they never contribute taxes into the program. A young parent who gives birth prior to joining the workforce will be denied benefits when they are caring for their newborn and then charged 1.1 percent of everything they earn for the rest of their life to finance a program that was not there for them when they needed it.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vamFjb2Jpbi5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS9taW5uZXNvdGEtcGFpZC1wYXJlbnRhbC1sZWF2ZS1pbmNvbWUtYmVuZWZpdC1leGNsdXNpb27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Paniers lifted the skirt away from the body at the hips, she explained.  1 / 1 Rita Brown has a great knowledge of fashion through the ages, and shared a brief history of underwear at the Tec-We-Gwill Women’s Institute hall on Monday evening. Paniers lifted the skirt away from the body at the hips, she explained.  A tantalizing topic attracted a full house to the Tec-We-Gwill Women’s Hall in Newton Robinson.  Guest speaker Rita Brown's talk this past week was titled 'Exposed — A Brief History of Underwear.'  Because the topic is often taboo, the straight talk on women’s undergarments got some laughs. It also got some gasps of disbelief when she discussed the restrictive and sometimes deforming effect they had.  Brown spent 43 years at the Shaw Festival Theatre in Niagara-on-the-Lake as 'senior cutter' for women’s costumes, and head of wardrobe from 1981 to 1990, and again for the 2009-10 season.  The study of period costumes and their underpinnings help create authentic costumes for the stage. As senior cutter, she made patterns from the show designer’s drawings. She took measurements of the actors and then created a pattern to their form.  Brown said it was important to the overall look on stage for the under structure to be right, especially in period dress.  “And then, of course, the shape of dress that goes over it fits beautifully and shows what is meant to show and hides what it is meant to hide,"" she explained.  Different periods emphasized different areas; sometimes it was the front, sometimes the rear.  Her presentation began with the fashion of the ancient worlds of Crete, Egypt, Greece, and Rome.  “Each dealt with breasts in their own way, either making them more prominent and exposing them, or trying to deny them,"" Brown said.  She took the audience members through the ages, mainly focusing on European fashion and that influenced by the royal courts, showing slides to provide examples.  She explained how those of high status wore undergarments that were not worn by the masses. She talked about busks, stays, corsets, paniers, crinolines, and the more comparatively modern girdles, underpants and bras.  Underwear are the “intimate, mysterious pieces of clothing that have always been part of the feminine allure,"" she said.  “The birth of modesty no doubt contributed to the invention of underclothing, as did the love of seduction; both hiding and revealing what one wanted to show. It is our second skin and plays a secret role in our lives, but also a very public one,"" Brown described.  Brown showed busks used in the 18th century that were inserted down the front of a dress from the chest to about the belly button. This was meant to keep the body straight, and certainly would have prevented bending at the waist.  She also talked of corsets that bound the upper body so tightly that it could break ribs and deform the back.  “Women's breasts have lived through many incarnations — compressed, uplifted, or left au naturel,"" she explained. ""After centuries of corsets that sheaved our bodies in armour, all to make them more desirable, women finally jettisoned this instrument of torture at the beginning of the 20th century and replaced it with something that was just as complicated but much less restricted — the brassiere.”  Brown has written a book about female riding wear, that will be published soon. She has specialized in the restoration of 18th-, 19th- and 20th-century dresses and textiles for dress historian and private collector, Martin Kamer.  She collaborated with Belgian artist Isabelle de Borchgrave on an exhibit called 'Papier a la Mode,' which was a collection of full-scale period dresses, from the 16th to the 20th centuries, based on private and museum collections, constructed entirely of paper. Over the period 1996 to 2008, 'Papier a la Mode' was exhibited in Brussels, Istanbul, London, New York, Paris, Sao Paulo, Tokyo, Toronto, and Venice.  The Women's Institute and the Tecumseth and West Gwillimbury Historical Society co-hosted the informative evening.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhcnJpZXRvZGF5LmNvbS9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL2JpcnRoLW9mLW1vZGVzdHktZW5tZXNoZWQtaW4taGlzdG9yeS1vZi13b21lbnMtdW5kZXJ3ZWFyLTcwMzIwMzDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

A male foal called Luujin and an as yet unnamed female were born to a herd of rare Przewalski's horses at the zoo this spring. The births are a boost to the zoo's international breeding program which backs up the endangered Przewalski's population in the wild. ""These guys form basically an insurance population, so that we can continue to bolster those populations out in the wild,"" says Danielle Hearne, the keeper at ZSL Whipsnade Zoo who cares for the horses. ""So, it's really important that they breed and we keep that population going."" READ MORE Brexit hampering animal transfer and breeding UK's endangered hedgehogs seek friendly hosts Rare hares threatened by rising temperatures Native to Asia, the Przewalski's horse is untamed – even here at Whipsnade, where it roams unhindered on a large expanse of open grassland. It is officially the only truly wild horse on earth, with two extra chromosomes that differentiate it from a domestic horse. It looks distinctive too, short, slightly stocky light brown in colour and with a short, tufted mane. In the past the species was hunted and forced off land by human development, driven to the point of extinction. An international breeding program in captivity saved a handful of horses and in the early 1990s descendants of these zoo horses were successfully reintroduced from zoos to reserves in Mongolia and China.  Endangered Przewalski's foal with mum Shargahan. /Whipsnade Zoo Endangered Przewalski's foal with mum Shargahan. /Whipsnade Zoo  There are now hundreds of Przewalski's horses living in their original habitat, where they are celebrated with pride. But although the species has made a remarkable comeback from extinction, it is still classed as endangered. Chinese researchers work alongside international zoos to monitor the Przewalski's horses' progress. ""They're not extinct, but they're extinct in the wild because they only survive in captivity with human help. So that's the stage we're at,"" says Jiang Zhigang, a professor from the Chinese Academy of Sciences who has conducted extensive research on the Przewalski's horse. ""The only problem is they still receive supplemental feeding in winter. In winter, the wild horse will face competition from domestic animals, so there's a problem."" Despite ever increasing numbers of Przewalski's horses in Mongolia and China, there are still challenges ahead as they re-establish themselves in the wild. ZSL has a partner program in Mongolia, helping to protect the species and its native habitat. Country Director Tungaa Ulambayar says the horses suffer from more extreme weather linked to climate change. ""These zoo animals are trying to kind of re-adapt back to their original native habitat, but because we have extreme drought, we have very heavy winters with very low temperatures,"" she says.  The foals are doing encouragingly well. /Whipsnade Zoo The foals are doing encouragingly well. /Whipsnade Zoo  The horses are also vulnerable to disease, parasites, predators like wolves and are affected by habitat loss, meaning protective breeding in zoos is still vital. ""We actually still need to support that population because not all those problems are straightaway solved,"" keeper Hearne explains. ""Their habitat is still being made much smaller by the expansion of human agriculture than it was previously, for them to have those resources to be able to survive."" Genetic diversity is also key for pure wild herds to continue to grow and thrive, making the birth of new foals at Whipsnade even more welcome news. The female in particular has the potential to help breed more lines worldwide in the future. ""She will go on to breed and have her own foals and carry on that lineage. So, for us it's really great that we have got that. Obviously, boys are important, but the females being able to have foals and breed with a number of stallions is really, really key for us. ""The chances in the future of bringing their status up is at the minute looking really positive. These animals are breeding in the wild. It's not just the reintroduced animals that are out there. And that's really important that the generations are breeding themselves.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c2V1LmNndG4uY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMy0wNS0yMy9VSy16b28td2VsY29tZXMtYmlydGgtb2YtZW5kYW5nZXJlZC1Nb25nb2xpYW4td2lsZC1ob3JzZXMtMWsxOENjNVQ3SHkvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The study led by a team from Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, US, showed that rising rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, preterm birth and low birthweight, over the past 10 years are largely attributable to the health status of a person before they get pregnant, rather than age.  The study found that the average age of pregnant individuals rose from 27.9 years in 2011 to 29.1 years in 2019, yet age accounted for only a small portion of the marked increase in adverse pregnancy outcomes seen during the same period.  Most striking, the rate of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (high blood pressure with or without preeclampsia or eclampsia) rose by over 50 per cent during the decade, yet the shift in age distribution of those giving birth accounted for less than two per cent of that change.  ""Although mothers are getting older at the time they deliver, that is not what's causing these adverse birth outcomes,"" said lead author Zachary Hughes, an internal medicine physician at Northwestern Memorial Hospital.  ""What's really driving it is pre-pregnancy health issues like diabetes and hypertension. That's important to know because these are factors we could potentially modify."" Using data from the National Center for Health Statistics Natality Files, researchers compared rates of preeclampsia and eclampsia, preterm birth and low birthweight among 3.9 million births in 2011 and 3.7 million births in 2019.  The results showed moderate increases in preterm birth and low birthweight (which rose by about two per cent and four per cent, respectively) and larger increases in hypertensive disorders (a 52 per cent increase).  Using statistical methods to analyse the role of age in these changes, researchers found the shift in age distribution accounted for only a small portion of the increase across all outcomes assessed.  Adverse pregnancy outcomes have important health consequences, including an increased risk of heart disease both at the time of pregnancy and later in life -- not only for the person giving birth but also for the baby.  Researchers said preventing these adverse outcomes could help reduce cardiovascular risk throughout each lifespan.  Across all age groups, people giving birth in their late teens to early thirties saw the steepest increases in adverse pregnancy outcomes.  Further research is needed to determine which specific health issues -- such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension or other factors -- are driving these pregnancy complications in younger people, researchers said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyaWJ1bmVpbmRpYS5jb20vbmV3cy9oZWFsdGgvbW90aGVycy1wb29yLWhlYWx0aC1pcy1tYWtpbmctcHJlZ25hbmN5LXJpc2tpZXItbm90LWFnZS1zdHVkeS01MTAyNjHSAWtodHRwczovL20udHJpYnVuZWluZGlhLmNvbS9uZXdzL2hlYWx0aC9tb3RoZXJzLXBvb3ItaGVhbHRoLWlzLW1ha2luZy1wcmVnbmFuY3ktcmlza2llci1ub3QtYWdlLXN0dWR5LTUxMDI2MQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

But important new research at Haifa’s Rambam Health Care Campus, Shaare Zedek Medical Center’s Sports Medicine Center and the IDF now encourages women in the months before and after delivery to do 150 minutes of medium-intensity aerobic exercise spread over at least three days combined with anaerobic resistance training, even if they had been inactive before pregnancy.  Physical activity is important and essential in pregnant women without contraindications, wrote Prof. Naama Constantini of Shaare Zedek (SZMC), obstetrician Dr. Ido Solt of Rambam and Amit Elbaz Braun of the IDF in the latest issue of Harefuah, the Israel Medical Association journal.  Why should pregnant women exercise?  A major American study quoted in the article showed that fewer than 15% of pregnant women exercise regularly.  Lack of physical activity during pregnancy can lead to excessive weight gain and pregnancy complications, they wrote. The nine months are also a chance to advance a healthful way of life and adopt new habits. Only a woman whose doctor advises her not to exercise because of her individual case needs to avoid such physical activity.  Fitness Class (credit: Wikimedia Commons)  Exercise during pregnancy reduces the risk of pre-eclampsia – a serious condition that can occur after the 20th week or after giving birth that pushes up blood pressure and can cause kidneys and the liver to stop functioning normally. Pre-eclampsia occurs in five to eight percent of pregnancies and in most cases leads to preterm birth.  Such physical exercise – both aerobics that gets the heart pumping and anaerobics that involves short bursts of intense energy and strengthens the muscles, like jumping rope, yoga and Pilates – has been proven not to cause miscarriage, infant hypoglycemia, early breaking of the waters, low birth weight or congenital defects, they wrote. If a pregnant woman exercises regularly, she can recover from delivery faster, reduce the risk of back pain, gestational diabetes and even post-natal depression.  The authors advise pregnant women, however, not to exercise outdoors in hot, very humid weather; riding on an outdoor bicycle or a horse; skiing; playing hockey; diving; or doing gymnastics – especially during the first trimester. They also shouldn’t participate in competitive sports unless permitted by their obstetrician. They should drink plenty of water and eat healthful foods and rest at regular intervals. And, of course, they must not smoke, drink alcohol or take drugs.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpwb3N0LmNvbS9oZWFsdGgtYW5kLXdlbGxuZXNzL3ByZWduYW5jeS1hbmQtYmlydGgvYXJ0aWNsZS03NDM4NDTSAU5odHRwczovL20uanBvc3QuY29tL2hlYWx0aC1hbmQtd2VsbG5lc3MvcHJlZ25hbmN5LWFuZC1iaXJ0aC9hcnRpY2xlLTc0Mzg0NC9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Muhammad, who has only been receiving tuition all this while, was all smiles when he received the document from NRD director-general Zamri Misman at his grandparents’ home here on Tuesday (May 23).  His 66-year-old grandmother Sabariah Ahmad expressed her gratitude to the department for issuing Muhammad with an identification document.  ""I have been worried for him because he has not been attending school and should have been in Year Two this year.  ""With this document, we can now get him enrolled,"" she said, adding that Muhammad was also unable to get treatment at a government health facility or travel as he did not have any identification document.  Sabariah said her son had failed to register his marriage to Muhammad's mother as the ceremony was conducted in a village.  ""Whenever I asked if he had registered Muhammad's birth, he would tell me that the imam who conducted the nikah ceremony did not have the proper credentials and that it would be a difficult process,"" she said.  Sabariah said Muhammad's mother died last year due to renal failure and his father suffered a fatal heart attack during the recent fasting month.  A worried Sabariah then started looking for any document she could to register Muhammad's birth.  ""While going through my son's belongings one day, I found some documents which I thought were helpful and immediately submitted an application,"" she said, adding that she was surprised that the NRD had processed and approved the application in such a short period.  Zamri when met later said the NRD had interviewed Muhammad's family members and other witnesses before issuing the document.  ""We discovered that Muhammad was delivered at home and raised in Puchong and we then decided to interview his family members, neighbours and other witnesses.  ""After going through the entire process, we decided to issue the birth certificate,"" he said, adding that Muhammad was a non-citizen as his mother was an Indonesian.  He said Muhammad's guardians must now go through the adoption process and then apply for his citizenship.  Zamri advised parents to register the birth of their child within 60 days as delays could cause unnecessary problems.  ""Whether your marriage is registered or otherwise, please register the birth of your child within the stipulated time failing which the process will be delayed,"" he said, adding that parents had no reason to delay this as there were 212 NRD offices nationwide.  He said from January last year till April this year, the NRD had approved 10,245 of the 14,557 applications for late birth registration.

With the might of Rome on one side and the naval supremacy of Carthage on the other, the war was an epic struggle that would shape the destiny of the Mediterranean world for centuries to come. From the towering warships of the Carthaginian fleet to the unstoppable Roman legions, this was a war that tested both heavyweight powers to their limits. At its end, Sicily became the first foreign Roman province and Carthage stepped back to lick its wounds, ready for the Second Punic War. This is the fascinating story of the First Punic War, a tale of heroism, sacrifice, and unimaginable cruelty that still resonates to this day.  The First Punic War Pre-War Warmup  In the centuries and decades running up to the First Punic War, the relationship between Rome and Carthage had been a cautiously peaceful if not completely friendly one. Each of the two powers had been well aware of how dangerous the other was, and signed peace treaties in 509, 348, 306, and 279 BC.  In these treaties, the two powers laid out their exact territories and spheres of influence and agreed not to step on each other's toes. Things began to go wrong when Rome began to renege on its side of the deal.  Carthage became concerned when it noticed Rome setting its sights on Magna Graecia , the name given by the Romans to the coast of Southern Italy. At the center of this territory lay Sicily, a strategically important island that the Carthaginians and Greek city-states had been fighting over for decades. Carthage could not allow it to fall into Roman hands.  Carthage’s concerns were confirmed when Rome took Rhegium (a Greek town on the strait that separates Italy and Sicily) and Agesil (another strategically important harbor town) allied itself with Rome against Carthage and Hieron II of Syracuse.  Hieron II of Syracuse, tyrant of ancient Greece. (Sailko/ CC BY 3.0 )  It was the loss of Messana that really upset the Carthaginians and made it clear Rome was not to be trusted. The town had been taken over by a group of untrustworthy mercenaries known as the Mamertines, who hailed from Italy, in 288 BC.  In 265 BC these mercenaries lost a battle to Hieron II of Syracuse and realized they needed outside help. At first, they approached the Carthaginians, who, keen to keep a foothold in the region, agreed to build a garrison in Messana.  Unfortunately, these mercenaries were not to be trusted and decided that Rome would make a better ally shortly afterward. From there things escalated quickly. The Mamertines removed the Carthaginian garrison and expelled its commander from the city.  Carthage responded by crucifying the unfortunate commander and forming an alliance with Acragas, a town in southern Sicily, and the Mamertine's enemies, Syracuse. At the same time, Rome sent one of its consuls, Appius Claudius Caudex, and two of its finest legions to Sicily.  The Carthaginians beat the Romans to Messana and with the help of Hieron II took back control of Messana. The Romans hadn’t been expecting such a strong response from Carthage. As they approached the town, they were greeted by the might of the Carthaginian fleet, led by Commander Hanno. They were essentially told to go home; Carthage wasn’t messing around.  Claudius Caudex responded by offering a peace deal, but Hanno was confident in his naval supremacy and rejected it. It proved to be a mistake.  Rome was not to be trifled with, and on its second attempt, the Roman ships backed by 16,000 troops managed to land at Messana and break the siege, defeating the Carthaginian and Syracuse occupying forces.  Roman legions during the First Punic War. ( Public Domain )  The Romans then went on the offensive. Led by a new commander, Manius Valerius Maximus Messalla, they took the fight to Syracuse. The Carthaginian fleet was too slow in aiding their ally and before they could help, Hieron II had not only surrendered but agreed to ally himself with Rome.  This was the spark that ignited the first Punic War. Undeterred by the loss of an important ally, Carthage sent a second army to Sicily in 262 BC. The fighting had only just begun.  Round 1 - Rome Starts Strong  In the war's beginning engagements, it looked like Carthage had bitten off more than it could chew. The Romans sent four legions, led by consuls L. Postumius Megellus and Q. Mamilius Vitulus, to Acragas (Agrigentum) in 262 BC. The Carthaginians rushed to their ally’s aid but were defeated.  Looking to make a point, the Romans sacked the city, showing the other city-states of Sicily what would happen to those who allied with Carthage. Segesta, another important ally of Carthage, got the message and joined the Romans a few months later in 261 BC.  Sicily became the first Roman province in the First Punic War. ( romas_ph /Adobe Stock)  The next two years saw a spate of minor engagements with no definitive victors. Acragas got the brunt of it, during this period it was sacked for a second time and much of its population was enslaved by Rome.  By 261 BC it had become clear that Rome dominated on land but Carthage’s domination on the sea was stopping Rome from landing a knockout blow. Rome needed a navy that was capable of preventing the constant enemy reinforcements if it wanted to control Sicily in its entirety.  Luckily for Rome, it had the people and the resources to build such a navy. In just 60 days Rome managed to build 20 triremes (high-speed galleys with three banks of oars) and 100 quinqueremes (powerful warships). By the spring of 260 BC Rome had its navy.  How did the Romans, who traditionally had little naval experience, manage this? By learning from their enemies. It’s likely the designs for the Roman ships were copied from captured Carthaginian ships.  But the Romans weren’t content to just copy their enemies. As was so often the case, they improved existing designs with their own technology. They added the Corvus, a rotating platform, to the ships. This 11-meter (36 ft) bridge was a boarding device that could be lowered onto enemy ships to allow a heavy infantry unit of around 100 men to board them.  The Corvus, the Roman ship boarding device. (Chewie/ CC BY-SA 2.5 )  The thinking was inspired. The Romans knew that their lack of experience meant the Carthaginians had the advantage at sea. The corvus made sea battles more like land battles, where the Romans held most of the cards.  The tactic was a major success. It was first used at the battle of Mylae, during which Rome's 145 ships, led by Duilius, defeated the Carthaginian fleet of 130 ships.  Despite this success, the next two years saw a continuous stalemate between the two powers. Rome’s next big naval win came at the battle of Sulcis in 258 BC. The defeat was so bad that the Carthaginians crucified their commander.  Another two years went by before the next major Roman victory. A large Roman fleet (said to be 330 ships strong) beat the Carthaginians at the Battle of Economus. It was abundantly clear that the Carthaginians, initially overconfident in their naval supremacy, hadn't come up with a countermeasure to the fearsome corvus.  The battle ended with consul Marcus Regulus Atilius landing four legions at Clupea in what is today Tunisia. The fighting had moved from Sicily to the Carthaginians’ front door.  Round 2 - Carthage Punches Back  This last major victory led to some classic Roman overconfidence. Shortly after landing in Tunisia, Rome recalled half of its army and fleet, leaving 15,000 infantry and 500 cavalry units to continue the war effort on enemy soil. As it turned out, this was more than enough to give Carthage a bloody nose.  Led once again by Regulus, the Roman army thrashed Carthage south of Tunis, where, despite their home advantage, rocky terrain meant Carthage couldn’t use their super-weapon, the elephant. The battle resulted in Regulus occupying the city. In 255 BC both sides attempted peace talks but these quickly ended thanks to Rome’s demands, which included Carthage abandoning Sicily altogether.  The war elephant gave Carthage a high advantage over its opponent. ( Public Domain )  Just as the Romans had learned to rework their navy, Carthage realized they needed to mix things up. They used Xanthippus, a legendary Spartan mercenary, to reorganize their army, and with 12,000 men and 4,000 cavalry units now at their disposal, decided to start landing counterblows.  It was almost a knockout for the Romans. Xanthippus combined his massive cavalry with 100 war elephants to completely decimate his enemy. In the resulting battle, the Carthaginians lost just 800 units compared to Rome’s 12,000. They even managed to capture the Roman commander. If only Rome hadn’t sent half of its forces home.  What was left of the Roman army, around 2000 men, fled and managed to unite with a freshly dispatched Roman fleet. This is where mother nature decided to stick the boot in. Most of this fleet was destroyed in a massive storm that, according to the historian Polybius, drowned up to 100,000 men.  Round Three - Back to Sicily  Having been knocked to the mat in Africa, Rome decided in 254 BC it was best to return its focus to Sicily. They started things off by capturing Panormus (Sicily’s capital today). The Romans made its 70,000-strong population a deal. If they could pay Rome 200 drachmas each, they would be spared. Anyone who couldn’t pay would be enslaved.  This initial success was once again dampened by mother nature. Shortly afterward, a Roman fleet led by C. Sempronius Blaesus was returning from an attack on North Africa when it was hit by another massive storm.  The Romans lost 150 ships and thousands of men. It’s believed the corvus, which added extra weight, may have been to blame since the tool was never mentioned again after this tragedy.  Over the next three years, things calmed down a little in Sicily as Carthage was forced to focus on problems closer to home, the war was dragging on and Carthage was struggling to maintain control of its African territories.  By 251 BC Carthage was ready to take the fight back to Sicily and the empire sent another expedition to the island. It didn’t go well. The Carthaginian army, led by Hasdrubal, was defeated by two Roman legions just outside of Panormus in June 250 BC. To add salt to the wound, the Romans captured many of Carthage’s elephants and shipped them back to Rome. The Romans then focused on sieging the various Carthaginian fortress cities.  Running Out of Stamina  The war had become an irritating stalemate of the Romans winning on land and the Carthaginians at sea. In 249 BC the Carthaginian fleet defeated the Roman fleet at Drepana. They managed to capture 93 of Rome’s 120 ships. Before the Romans could bounce back a fleet of 800 Roman supply ships was sunk by yet another storm.  Both sides were beginning to buckle under the weight of war. The war was pretty much put on hiatus until 247 BC, by which time both sides had managed to fund more armies. During this time Carthage had even been reduced to approaching Egypt’s ruler, Ptolemy II, for money, which he refused.  The Carthaginian army recommenced its war effort under a new commander, Hamilcar Barca (the father of the infamous Hannibal). Hamilcar proved to be just what they needed. He led blazing-fast raids along the Italian coast in 247 BC, looking for money to pay his mercenaries.  Carthaginian coin, likely depicting Hamilcar. On its reverse is a war elephant (Unknown Author / Public Domain )  He soon landed in Sicily where he attacked the Roman rear while Carthage's enemy was busy attacking Drepana and Lilybaeum, the last of Carthage’s strongholds in Sicily. Hamilcar was an expert in guerilla tactics and despite the fact that Carthage could no longer field a large army, managed to capture Eryx in 244 BC.  It was beginning to look like Carthage was no longer on the ropes. While Hamilcar was busy fighting in Sicily, another leader, Hanno the Great, was expanding Carthage’s African territories, securing much-needed tax revenue for the war effort.  Going Out with a Whimper  Ultimately, the First Punic War ended with a whimper. By 242 BC the Romans had built a new fleet of 200 ships, paid for by loans from private citizens. This was a desperate measure, and the Romans knew they needed to end the war for good.  Led by Gaius Lutatius Catulus, Rome's new fleet laid siege on Drepana. The following year on 10th March 241 BC, the Romans defeated Hanno’s Carthaginian fleet.  The Romans sank 50 ships and captured 70, taking 10,000 prisoners. In the grand scheme of things, it wasn’t a massive loss, but Carthage had run out of money. With no other choice, Carthage chose to seek peace terms.  Territory ceded to Rome by Carthage under the peace treaty is shown in pink. ( CC BY-SA 3.0 )  The agreement was simple. Carthage had to leave Sicily for good and pay 3,200 talents of silver to Rome over the next ten years. Rome also took Sicily as its first foreign province with Corsica and Sardinia following soon after.  Conclusion  The First Punic War was both a pivotal moment in the history of the ancient world and a complete waste. On the one hand, it handed Rome a major victory over one of its biggest competitors and ushered in a new era of Roman expansion in the region.  But on the other hand, it took both empires a long time to fully recover. Carthage spent the next few decades dealing with rebellions and wars in its own lands while Rome largely ignored Sicily after fighting so hard to take it in the first place.  A generation later and the two old enemies were back at it with the Second Punic War of 218-201 BC. The Punic Wars were a time of triumph and tragedy, heroism and sacrifice that will always be remembered as one of the defining moments of human history. They are also a reminder of the utter futility of war.  Top image: Roman ship ramming a Carthaginian ship. Naval battles were key in the First Punic War.

"birth","2023-05-18","Not Discerned","{""Jackson"", ""Mississippi"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T09:00:00","If there was ever a time for Republicans to back efforts to expand birth control access, U.S. Sen. Patty Murray of Washington thinks this should be it.  ""Women in many states today, because of the decision by the Supreme Court, are really worried about their access to be able to have birth control pills as a way of making sure they don't become pregnant, because in their states, they won't have access to abortion care,"" Murray, a Democrat, said in an interview with NPR.  ""I disagree wholeheartedly with the Supreme Court decision,"" she said, referring to last summer's Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization ruling that overturned decades of abortion-rights precedent. ""But at the same time, we need to make sure that over-the-counter birth control is available.""  Murray re-introduced legislation on Thursday that would require insurance companies to cover over-the-counter birth control pills as soon as they become available without a prescription, as recently recommended unanimously by a Food and Drug Administration panel. More than 100 countries already allow oral contraceptives to be dispensed this way.  Murray's bill would build on a requirement in the Affordable Care Act that most health insurance companies provide contraceptive coverage without a co-pay.  ""Now that we are seeing that it may become available over the counter, we want to make sure that insurers still pay for it because it is costly,"" Murray says. ""This is a great step if FDA approves this and women can go to the drugstore and purchase it without having to have a doctor's appointment ... but it will only be available for some women if it is not covered by insurance.""  A push for Republican support  In the wake of the Dobbs decision, Murray says she hopes Republicans will join her — which would be essential in a closely-divided Congress for her legislation to advance.  Murray notes that some Republicans who oppose abortion rights have said they do not intend to limit access to birth control. Leaders of the Congressional Pro-Life Caucus, among others, have made such claims.  ""I say to them, this is your opportunity to show people that you are living the words that you're speaking and co-sign the legislation,"" Murray says. ""Work with us. Let's get this passed.""  So far, she has no Republican co-sponsors. But some Congressional Republicans have a history of supporting legislation meant to ease access to contraceptives. Last year, just weeks after the Dobbs decision, a group of Iowa Republicans including Senators Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley and Congresswomen Mariannette Miller-Meeks and Ashley Hinson proposed legislation designed to expedite efforts to make certain contraceptives available over the counter to patients 18 and older.  Groups opposed to abortion rights have generally avoided taking positions explicitly opposing contraception, although some support legislation that reproductive rights advocates warn could threaten access to some birth control methods.  In a statement, Students for Life of America described the move toward over-the-counter birth control as ""reckless"" and suggested that easier distribution of birth control pills is unwise given rising rates of some types of sexually transmitted infections, which the organization described as an ""epidemic of sexually transmitted disease.""  A separate fight - over abortion pills  Murray's bill focuses on improving access to birth control pills, which prevent pregnancy. But the proposal comes amidst other battles over access to reproductive health care, including ongoing litigation in the federal courts over the abortion pill, mifepristone. That drug is widely used in combination with another medication to terminate mostly first-trimester pregnancies, and to treat patients experiencing miscarriages.  A lawsuit filed by a coalition of anti-abortion rights groups challenges the FDA's approval of the pill in 2000 and several subsequent rule changes that have eased access to the drug, including allowing the pills to be distributed by mail. It seeks to remove mifepristone from the market altogether.  In the latest development in that case, a federal appeals court heard arguments last week during a hearing in New Orleans.  As NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin reported, a panel of conservative-leaning federal judges posed questions to lawyers on both sides. Judge Cory Wilson asked Deputy Assistant Attorney General Sarah Harrington, who was representing the FDA, what happens to patients who receive pills in the mail, if the drugs do not successfully terminate a pregnancy within two weeks. Harrington told Wilson that in a small percentage of cases, patients may need to contact their healthcare providers for follow-up care.  Abortion rights advocates say medication abortion is a preferred option for many patients for a variety of reasons, including for people who live in rural areas without access to abortion clinics, those who want to avoid a surgical procedure to terminate an unwanted pregnancy or help ease a miscarriage already underway, or who prefer to complete the process at home.  In an interview with NPR's Becky Sullivan, a woman named Rebecca, who asked that we use only her first name, said that having the option to terminate her pregnancy at home in 2020 during the pandemic was a ""godsend,"" particularly given the fact that she believed some of her family members would not have supported her decision.  ""Being able to do it in the privacy of my home and not having to explain anything to anyone is the biggest part of it,"" she said.

"birth","2022-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T10:10:18","Thalassemia is a genetic blood disorder that affects millions of people worldwide, including a significant number in India. It is a chronic and lifelong disease that requires continuous medical care, management, and treatment, making it a huge financial burden on families. The best solution to tackle thalassemia is to prevent the birth of affected children. Screening of pregnant women before birth is crucial to identify thalassemia carriers, who can then be counseled about their options and make informed decisions.  Thalassemia is inherited from both parents, and carriers have a 25% chance of passing on the disease to their children. When two carriers of thalassemia genes have a child, there is a 50% chance that the child will inherit two mutated copies of the gene, leading to thalassemia major. The only feasible way to prevent the birth of a thalassemic child is to identify carrier parents through screening before birth. If both parents are found to be carriers, they can opt for prenatal testing to determine if the fetus has the disease. If the test is positive, the parents can choose to terminate the pregnancy and prevent the birth of a child with thalassemia.  The burden of thalassemia is significant, not only for patients but also for their families and society. Treatment for thalassemia major is expensive and involves regular blood transfusions, medication, and frequent hospital visits. Without treatment, the disease can cause severe anemia and organ damage. Patients with thalassemia require lifelong medical care, making it a significant financial burden on families. Moreover, finding a matching stem cell donor is rare and difficult, making it difficult for patients to undergo stem cell transplantation, which is the only cure for thalassemia.  The government and society’s impetus should be on prevention rather than cure, given the financial and emotional burden of thalassemia on families. Awareness programs and campaigns to educate people about the importance of screening before birth can help prevent the birth of thalassemic children. Several thalassemia societies in India are working towards this goal, connecting patients with local blood banks and government medical colleges to help them get free blood transfusions.  Mothers are often blamed for their child’s health problems, including thalassemia. This is because of a lack of awareness about how thalassemia is genetically inherited. It is crucial to educate people that both parents need to be carriers or patients of thalassemia for their child to inherit the disease. Blaming mothers for thalassemia is a result of ignorance and social prejudices, especially in smaller cities and towns.  India has the largest number of children with thalassemia major globally, and approximately 10,000-15,000 children with thalassemia major are born every year in the country. Prevention of thalassemia through screening before birth is the most effective way to reduce the burden of the disease on families and society.  In conclusion, screening of pregnant women before birth is essential to prevent the birth of thalassemic children. The burden of thalassemia is significant and can be avoided by identifying carrier parents through screening before birth. The government, healthcare providers, and society should work together to create awareness about thalassemia, its inheritance, and the importance of screening before birth. Only through prevention can we tackle this chronic and lifelong disease and improve the quality of life of thalassemia patients and their families.

Sophie Small, 30, gave birth to daughters Holly and Darcy in August 2020, initially believing the girls were twins.  However, midwives were left baffled by the babies’ different sizes, with Darcy tipping the scales at 4 pounds, 2 ounces and Holly — who was born second — weighing a much heavier 6 pounds, 1 ounce.  Doctors later determined that the girls were actually conceived a month apart due to superfetation — a phenomenon whereby a second pregnancy occurs shortly after the first one.  According to the Cleveland Clinic, “Superfetation is so rare in humans that there are only about 10 confirmed cases.”  “They’re so unique that when they happen, they often make headlines” the clinic’s info page states. “The chance that you’ll be affected by superfetation is close to zero.”  The clinic claims that a pregnant woman’s body goes through “hormonal changes that make it nearly impossible to become pregnant while a fertilized egg (embryo) is already growing inside the uterus.”  Sophie Small, 30, gave birth to daughters Holly and Darcy in August 2020, initially believing the girls were twins. Kennedy News & Media  However, midwives were left baffled by the babies’ different sizes, with Darcy tipping the scales at 4 pounds, 2 ounces and Holly — who was born second— weighing a much heavier 6 pounds, 1 ounce. Kennedy News & Media  Small’s husband, Jonathan, is pictured with the girls. Kennedy News & Media  Small — who is one of the handful of women to have experienced the phenomenon — told Kennedy News that her pregnancy was “horrific.”  She suffered extreme morning sickness and was hospitalized eight times in seven weeks.  “I was carrying two babies who were growing at different stages, but we didn’t know that,” the mom stated. “They couldn’t work out why I was so sick. I was expecting twins but one was bigger than the other.”  “They had their own sacs and placentas, so they could feed when they wanted to,” she further explained. “But they [doctors] couldn’t work out why one twin was bigger than the other.”  It was only after the girls were born at such significantly different sizes that medics carried out tests and determined that the babies were not twins at all.  “Darcy was a 32-week baby and Holly was a 36-week baby,” Small declared.  It was only after the girls were born at such significantly different sizes that medics carried out tests and determined that the babies were not twins at all. Kennedy News & Media  Small says others don’t even believe the girls are related due to their different appearances and personalities. Kennedy News & Media  The Britain-based swimming instructor — who is also a mom to 6-year-old son Oscar — says skeptics simply don’t believe her when she tells them the incredible story.  “People think I’m a nutter [crazy] when I explain,” she declared. “They ask how many minutes apart they are, and I say, ‘Darcy is two minutes older and four weeks younger, while Holly was born two minutes after but is four weeks older.’ “  Meanwhile, Small says others don’t even believe the girls are related due to their different appearances and personalities.  “Holly has blond hair, big beautiful blue eyes and wants to be a princess or a jockey,” the mom explained. “Darcy’s hair is a mousey brown hair, she’s a tomboy and wants to be a train driver when she’s older.”  Small says she knew she was ‘”very fertile” because of how quickly she conceived Oscar and believes she ovulated again when she was already pregnant with Holly.  “People think I’m a nutter [crazy] when I explain,” she declared. “They ask how many minutes apart they are, and I say, ‘Darcy is two minutes older and four weeks younger, while Holly was born two minutes after but is four weeks older.’ “ Kennedy News & Media  Holly was born with cerebral palsy, which affects the right side of her body, and it’s unclear whether the condition is a result of the superfetation.  Meanwhile, Darcy’s stomach lining hadn’t developed properly at the time of her arrival, given that she born prematurely at 32 weeks.  Small told Kennedy News Service that she spent the first few months of her daughters’ lives in and out of the hospitals, but declared that they are now thriving.  While Holly remains 6 pounds heavier than sister Darcy, the pair are taking on the world.  “They’re very mischievous, fun-loving little girls,” the proud mom declared. “They’re absolutely thriving. They’ve started nursery, and they’re very confident.”  The girls are pictured with their big brother, Oliver. Kennedy News & Media  “I had no idea what the future would hold for them when they were born,” she added. “It was so difficult, but we’re so happy and blessed to have them.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzIyL2ktZ290LXByZWduYW50LXR3aWNlLWluLTI4LWRheXMtYW5kLWhhZC1ib3RoLWJhYmllcy1vbi10aGUtc2FtZS1kYXkv0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly9ueXBvc3QuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMjIvaS1nb3QtcHJlZ25hbnQtdHdpY2UtaW4tMjgtZGF5cy1hbmQtaGFkLWJvdGgtYmFiaWVzLW9uLXRoZS1zYW1lLWRheS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"birth","2023-07-25","Not Discerned","{""Detroit"", ""Michigan"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T13:48:25","The third roundtable of the New Jersey First Lady Tammy Murphy’s Initiative on maternal and infant health took place in Detroit, Michigan, presided by New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer.  The roundtable identified the barriers for mothers and families seeking care and surfaced opportunities for states and health systems to mitigate challenges, ensuring better access to high quality care for moms and babies. This discussion brought to light issues related to maternity care quality improvement initiatives in states, work to further grow and diversify the perinatal workforce to create the access to the types of care that families are seeking, and the importance of access to wholistic maternity care that includes mental health, physical health, and the social determinants of health. This is the third in the series of four roundtables occurring over the first half of 2023.  The roundtable discussion on Expanding Access and Quality of Care raised eight key themes:  Quality Care Includes Addressing Obstetric Racism  Black women are three times more likely to die from a pregnancy-related cause than White women. Multiple factors contribute to these disparities, including structural racism and implicit bias. Accountability for BIPOC deaths has spurred new approaches. One new, validated measurement tool that has been developed to counter obstetric racism is called The PREM-OB Scale™. The PREM-OB Scale examines obstetric racism, as defined for, by, and with Black mothers and Black birthing people, during hospitalization for labor, birth, and postpartum in six theorized patient identified quality of care domains: Safety, Autonomy, Communication, Racism, Empathy, and Dignity = SACRED. Nineteen hospitals across ten states are currently registered as partners in implementing this innovative approach which was only validated in 2022.  Culturally Reverent Workforce Pipelines and Access to Capital  As states begin to cover the costs for doulas and community support workers, reimbursement for midwives, and licensure for birth centers, states need to consider the birth workforce pipeline. These policies help create the potential for a more diverse and layered workforce, but the reimbursement policy changes alone will not create the pipeline of workers to fill these roles. States can support the expansion of midwifery schools, scholarships for doula and peer support training programs, mentoring and recruitment outreach, and also access to capital to build more accredited birthing centers. The roundtable attendees discussed the possibility of Historically Black Colleges and Universities creating programs for these birth workforce models. Certified nurse midwives, substance use disorder workforce, and midwives in rural health care are all eligible categories for the federal HRSA student loan repayment programs.  Midwifery and Free-Standing Birth Centers  States are starting to reimburse two distinct types of midwifery care for births* and are starting to allow the establishment of free-standing birth centers. The freestanding birth center is defined as a facility where birth is planned to take place away from the hospital and away from the person’s residence, where care is provided in the midwifery and wellness model, with birth center care integrated into the healthcare system. Over the past 40 years, the number of birth centers in the United States has grown to more than 400 as of 2021. The number of births in birth centers has doubled over the past 10 years and was almost 20,000 in 2019. This represents only .5% of annual births in the United States.  * Certified Nurse-Midwives (CNM) and Certified Midwives (CM) are trained in both nursing and midwifery. The training is hospital-based, and the vast majority of CNMs practice in clinics and hospitals. Although their training occurs in medical settings, the CNM/CM scope of practice allows them to provide care in any birth setting. Certified Midwives (CM), sometimes referred to as Direct Entry Midwives, are individuals who have or receive a background in a health-related field other than nursing, then graduate from a masters level midwifery education program. They have similar training to CNMs, conform to the same standards as CNMs, but are not required to have the nursing component.  Reducing Cesarean Rates  Cesarean births, births via surgical intervention, have increased in countries around the world, now accounting for more than 1 in 5 of all childbirths. On average, in the United States in 2021, 32.1% of live births were cesarean deliveries; Utah has one of the lowest cesarean rates at 23.4% of all births, Alabama has the highest at 35.1%. Eliminating the overuse of cesarean births and promoting, protecting, and supporting vaginal births is an important goal around maternal mortality and morbidity. Since most people are healthy enough when becoming pregnant, the system incentives need to be changed to eliminate overuse of cesarean births and promote, protect, and support vaginal births.  Blending Traditional and Western Medicine  According to a National Indian Health Board (NIHB) report, indigeneity is the number one social determinant of health. There are some Indigenous regions that are creating a hybrid of the best western medicine has to offer alongside traditional medicine, including allowing traditional healers to practice alongside doctors with permissions from the hospitals. For example, in Detroit, Michigan, The American Indian Health and Family Services clinic is adopting this type of model.  Earlier Postpartum Care  Current practice typically creates a gap in care between delivery and a postpartum obstetric visit of six weeks. This is a vulnerable time and one where perinatal mood and anxiety disorders can quickly take hold along with physical health complications. Universal home visits conducted by pregnancy and postpartum doulas bridge this critical gap in care. NJ is one of several states implementing a universal home visiting program.  Paid Family Leave  States should support the evidence behind paid family leave policies. The Prenatal-3 Policy Center notes that state paid family leave programs can improve the economic security of the family and keep parents engaged in the workforce. The programs help new parents have more time to bond with their babies, develop positive caregiving skills, and build the foundation for healthy attachment. Further, parents may be better able to seek timely and preventative health care for themselves and their children.  Perinatal Mood and Anxiety Disorders  This roundtable emphasized the importance of addressing perinatal mood and anxiety disorders and perinatal substance misuse. According to 2022 CDC data, the leading underlying causes of pregnancy-related death include:  Mental health conditions (including deaths to suicide and overdose/poisoning related to substance use disorder) (23%)  Excessive bleeding (hemorrhage) (14%)  Cardiac and coronary conditions (relating to the heart) (13%)  Perinatal mental health and substance use disorders are the most common complication in pregnancy, affecting one in five women, and one that carries significant, long-term impact. Mathematica research published in 2019 and led by Dr. Kara Zivin who presented at the roundtable, estimated that the total societal cost of untreated PMADs in the U.S. is $14.2 billion for just the total births in 2017 (one year) when following the mother-child pair from pregnancy through five years postpartum. It is important to require screening and build a continuum of care to treat both perinatal mood and anxiety disorders and substance use disorders. Currently, only 11 states require maternal depression screening through Medicaid. Screening is only the beginning to ensure that perinatal behavioral health concerns are monitored and more fully explored. The continuum of care to support treatment to remission for women with mild to severe symptoms as well as providing prevention needs more attention. One success is the number of states that are starting tele-psychiatry consultation programs in this space to give front-line providers real-time access to the most highly trained reproductive psychiatrists in the state. These programs are typically started with funding from HRSA and then sustained through a mix of state funding and fee-based structures. The original program and model for most states is called McPAP for Moms in Massachusetts.  A Note on Language: This report uses the phrase “maternal and infant health” to refer to the health of individuals with the capacity to become pregnant, regardless of gender identity, and their biological infants. We do not assume that all individuals giving birth will care for that child, so the report refers to caregivers, partners, and spouses.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5nYS5vcmcvbmV3cy9jb21tZW50YXJ5L21hdGVybmFsLWFuZC1pbmZhbnQtaGVhbHRoLWV4cGFuZGluZy1hY2Nlc3MtYW5kLXF1YWxpdHktb2YtY2FyZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"birth","2023-05-22","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-23T06:00:00","Amy Childs had to face a challenging labour last month when giving birth to her twins – son Billy and daughter Amelia (known as Millie).  The ex-TOWIE favourite, 32, had to undergo an emergency C-section when her newborn son suffered a prolapsed umbilical cord after Amy’s waters broke.  “Billy had wires all around him,” the mum of four recalls. “It was so sad. We are giving him all the cuddles in the world.”  But just over a month on, with her babies in the clear, she’s finally adjusting to life at home as a family of six.  And in true reality TV fashion, Amy caught the entire jaw-dropping, tear-jerking experience on camera, so fans can soon catch up with all the drama for themselves on her brand new ITVBe series, Amy Childs: The Twin Life.  The show will see Amy and partner Billy Delbosq, 40 – as well as her two children Polly, five, and Ritchie, four, from previous relationships – relive the trauma of her double labour and attempt to navigate the haphazard sleeping and feeding schedules that come with twin tots.  Here, Amy gives OK! a glimpse into what they can expect…  Hi Amy. We’re sorry to hear about your emergency C-section, how are you doing now?  Obviously, I had a birth plan – but they don’t always go to plan. Two days after we came back home, Bill said, “That was traumatic.” They were definitely five days we are never going to forget. But we documented it all for the show and I really can’t wait for everyone to see it. It is an eye-opener. I was looking at Bill thinking, ‘Oh, my God, what have we been through?!’ Being a first-time dad he was not expecting this.  What happened during labour?  Billy had a prolapsed cord. It’s really rare. The midwife was amazing, she knew the cord was there. Afterwards, he was in the neonatal unit, so my Bill put me in a wheelchair to go down to the other ward to feed him – he had all wires around him. I fed him in the night and went back to the ward.  I didn’t want to leave him. Millie was with us. I said to Bill, “I’ve got Millie so you go and sit with him for an hour.” We took it in turns to go and see him. It was really sad. I didn’t want him to miss out on anything. Two days later, he was back with us. We are giving him all the cuddles in the world. It wasn’t plain sailing – it’s a bit of a blur! But they are here now and they are fine. I am very much a positive person.  How are you adjusting to life as a mum of baby twins?  Touch wood, they are really good babies! Billy is a bit needy – like his dad – he likes a cuddle. He would happily sleep in my bed but I am regimented. They are in their snooze pods. Millie is more content. It is so mad – they are six weeks old but they are so different. And they look completely different – they don’t look anything alike.  Have your families been there to lend a helping hand during the more difficult days?  Definitely. My mum stays over sometimes, which is lovely. We are so happy because me and Bill are like, “Oh my God we can get eight hours sleep tonight,” whenever she is doing the overnights! We have got cribs downstairs – I get everything sorted out for her. But I know for a fact, at two o’clock in the morning, I will hear the babies cry and be downstairs. But at least I know I can go back upstairs and have another three hours sleep. We get very excited when we get more than four hours!  And now you and Bill are engaged! Were you expecting a proposal?  It was a complete shock, even though we have spoken about an engagement before. It is so lovely we have it on camera, but again, it’s a little bit of a blur!  How did he pop the question?  We were having a newborn shoot for the show. The pictures looked beautiful. Bill said, “Let’s put a nice outfit on them.” I didn’t think anything of it. As I came out of the changing room, Bill was on one knee, and the babies had on sleepsuits that said, “Mummy, will you marry my daddy?” on them. It was so beautiful. I was very emotional – I was crying!  How are the wedding plans coming along?  Everyone has been like, “When are you going to get married?” but I do just want to enjoy being engaged for a while and have the twins for a couple of months. Then we will start looking at places. Maybe we will start to plan next year to have the wedding the year after… We have just finished filming and I have a few jobs on. I am in work mode!  Could you see yourselves welcoming another child together in the future?  I don’t think I’m going to have any more. Although I do change my mind like the wind! When I had the twins, I was like, “Definitely not.” But now, I think, “Will I have one more?” I don’t know! At this moment in time, no. But in the future? We’ll have to think about it…  AMY CHILDS: THE TWIN LIFE PREMIERES TUESDAY 23RD MAY AT 9PM, ON ITVBE AND ITVX.

"birth","1954-01-22","Not Discerned","{""NewYork"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T13:00:00","Opinion: Modern birth control and its discriminative history continue to control women’s bodies.  ----------  Use of birth control across the U.S. has increased with the rise of reproductive rights in the past few decades. People with uteruses have various options, such as the pill, IUD, implant and patch. Yet its racist history shines through and creates a modern method of controlling women’s bodies.  Since the earliest times, humanity has tried to control and prevent pregnancy. Childbirth has been dangerous, especially before modern medicine. It wasn’t until the 20th century that birth control started to progress.  In 1907, Indiana passed the first eugenics law in the world, legalizing forced sterilization. Thirty-two other states eventually followed suit. Indiana’s law allowed anyone in state custody to be sterilized if deemed “unfit” to reproduce. Unsurprisingly, this targeted Black and Native American women and poor and disabled people. This form of birth control sterilized an estimated amount of 60,000 people.  The push for greater access to birth control started in 1921. After visiting poor neighborhoods in New York City, Margaret Sanger established the American Birth Control League. She too wanted to prevent “undesirable women” from reproducing.  The organization was eventually transitioned into what we know as Planned Parenthood. Today, it acknowledges its discriminative roots. Merle McGee, the former chief equity and engagement officer for Planned Parenthood of Greater New York, spoke about Planned Parenthood’s history with the Washington Post in 2020.  “The Sanger legacy unchecked or unmet with a reckoning has been weaponized against women of color and has effectively hampered our ability to be in a right relationship with women of color,” McGee said.  Scientists John Rock and Gregory Pincus announced the first birth control pill in the mid-1950s. But before the contraception became available to the public, it had to be tested. Two hundred poor Puerto Rican women signed up, not knowing they were a part of a clinical trial.  The scientists were easily able to exploit the women due to their lack of access. The pill had high levels of the hormone progesterone, leading to extreme side effects, sterilization and in rare cases, death.  Physicians Pamela Verma Liao and Janet Dollin addressed the Puerto Rican sterilization in their historical review of the pill.  “Despite the substantial positive effect of the pill, its history is marked by a lack of consent, a lack of full disclosure, a lack of true informed choice, and a lack of clinically relevant research regarding risk,” Liao and Dollin said.  Modern birth control is widely used and no longer engages in targeted sterilization. However, its control on women’s bodies and health persists.  Six years ago, I started taking the pill. I was only 15. But because I got into my first serious relationship, it was considered “mandatory.” The pill immediately threw my hormones off balance. Weight gain, mood swings, suppressed sex drive, nausea, PH balance, change in appetite—you name it.  All birth control methods come with an information sheet listing the possible side effects. Yet it wasn’t until I went off the pill that I fully realized its effect on my body. Everything that I thought was normal wasn’t. I finally began to feel like myself.  After a few months, I started a new pill. Not because I wanted to, but because I felt like I needed birth control to engage in sexual activity.  Students for Choice, a reproductive rights group at the University of Oregon, promotes education and activism on campus.  Society pressures women into thinking they can’t be sexual beings without birth control. That there is no other option. So when women choose to stay off, they are often judged within society, said member Renate Prazak.  Avery Cassler, a member of S4C, said, “There’s an expectation that biologically female bodies need to be regulated. We’re regulated since birth, and birth control is just an extension of that.”  Let me be clear in saying that access to and use of birth control are still important. Each individual has their own experience with birth control, good or bad. Instead of promoting birth control as the only option, there needs to be better sex education.  “Birth control is for everyone. It’s important to educate people about the safety of vasectomies and that they’re reversible,” Sydnee Warren from S4C said. “Expanding abortion access and sex education” are key to advocating reproductive rights.  Historical and modern birth control share a common purpose of regulating women’s bodies. Ultimately, reproductive rights aren’t about preventing pregnancy, but rather empowering women to finally take control of their bodies.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseWVtZXJhbGQuY29tL29waW5pb24vaG9iYnMtYmlydGgtY29udHJvbHMtY2hva2Vob2xkLW9uLXdvbWVucy1ib2RpZXMvYXJ0aWNsZV9iZDI2ODA0Mi1mNjczLTExZWQtYmYzMi02ZjAxMGJkZDQ5NzQuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Minister said that registration of births and deaths is important for updating citizens’ register, electoral rolls and list of people who avail beneficiary schemes. Mr. Shah was speaking at the inauguration of the new Census building in Delhi.  The decennial Census that was to be completed in 2021 has been indefinitely postponed, initially due to COVID-19 pandemic. The government has not given any specific reason to postpone the exercise which was last done in 2011.  While speaking at the event, Mr. Shah did not mention when the next Census will be conducted but said that registration of births and deaths helps in making development plans in the intermittent period between the two Censuses.  The Hindu reported on October 28, 2021 that the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) proposes to amend the Registration of Birth and Death Act, 1969 and maintain the database at the national level that will be available with the Registrar General of India (RGI) to update the Population Register, the Electoral Register, and the Aadhar, ration card, passport and driving licence databases.  Mr. Shah said, “The government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is going to make such arrangements that as soon as a person turns 18, the Election Commission will intimate him and make his voter card. In case of someone’s death, the Census registrar will send a notice to the family that they have received information about the person’s death and the family has 15 days to object, following which the Election Commission will remove his name from the voter list.”  He said geofencing of blocks to be covered under the Sample Registration System (SRS) is being done so that the enumerator cannot fudge the data and responsibility is fixed.  Mr. Shah also launched an upgraded SRS mobile application system. SRS is a large-scale demographic survey conducted every year by the RGI office to estimate the birth rate, death rate, as well as other fertility and mortality indicators.  “If any official commits fraud, the system will send alerts at national and State levels. If a person tries to conduct the survey from somewhere else, it will be known that the person is not present at the block. Even smallest of errors can have cumulative effect on the entire data,” Mr. Shah said.  He said earlier the census was not accurate. “The government will now conduct the Census electronically where every person will have the right to fill the data which will be verified and audited. This will include more than 35 parameters of socio-economic status.”  He said that data which could be used for framing development schemes were not present in the earlier Censuses, nor was there a system for such data analysis.  He further said basic amenities such as water, electricity, house, and health could not be provided to people for 70 years after Independence because no one knew the budget such schemes would entail. He added that a target for providing houses to all couldn’t be fixed because of lack of required data. He said that such usage of Census was not possible earlier due to lack of access, accuracy, online unavailability of Census and bridge between planning and Census.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVoaW5kdS5jb20vbmV3cy9uYXRpb25hbC9iaWxsLXRvLWxpbmstZGVhdGgtYW5kLWJpcnRoLXJlZ2lzdGVyLXdpdGgtZWxlY3RvcmFsLXJvbGxzLWluLW5leHQtc2Vzc2lvbi1vZi1wYXJsaWFtZW50LWFtaXQtc2hhaC9hcnRpY2xlNjY4ODIwMzguZWNl0gGiAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhpbmR1LmNvbS9uZXdzL25hdGlvbmFsL2JpbGwtdG8tbGluay1kZWF0aC1hbmQtYmlydGgtcmVnaXN0ZXItd2l0aC1lbGVjdG9yYWwtcm9sbHMtaW4tbmV4dC1zZXNzaW9uLW9mLXBhcmxpYW1lbnQtYW1pdC1zaGFoL2FydGljbGU2Njg4MjAzOC5lY2UvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

In a report by TODAY, Michael and Hannah Carmack shared that the quadruplets were born out of their decision to have a second child after their eight-year-old daughter named Emily. But it was to their great surprise when Hannah examined her first pregnancy scan and saw two sacs on the screen.  Recalling his wife's interaction with the ultrasound technician, Michael said, ""She was like, 'Twins?' But the ultrasound tech didn’t respond. Then Hannah goes, 'Is it three?' Then the ultrasound tech put her hand on Hannah’s knee and said, 'Sweetie, it’s four.' I started laughing.""  Michael then shared that his wife started to cry upon hearing the news—but they were not tears of joy.  ""I always wanted a big family, but that wasn’t Hannah’s dream,"" he said.  Because of this big responsibility that had been unexpectedly put on their shoulders, the couple decided to speak with a pastor to help them understand the right path to take. They sat with him for more than an hour and discussed how they were feeling about growing their family from three to seven.  ""What I think Hannah came to realize is, 'This is not normal. We had been chosen for something by God,'"" Michael said.  After a heart-to-heart talk, the couple felt stronger than ever.  Hannah welcomed their two sets of identical twins in March: girls, Evelyn and Adeline, and boys, David and Daniel.  The babies were born at 27 weeks gestation and the birthing process had been done via cesarean section. Adeline was the smallest of them all, weighing one pound, 10.5 ounces while Evelyn was the largest, weighing two pounds, 9 ounces.  At two months old, Michael shared that they are now starting to see glimpses of their personalities, with Evelyn being the ""sweet, smiley one"" while Daniel and Adeline are slowly building up a close sibling relationship with their adorable interactions.  While the babies are now breathing on their own and ""doing great,"" they still need assistance with eating, so they are being cared for in the hospital until their technical due date in June. Michael and Hannah, meanwhile, have their hands full in remodeling their 1200-square-foot home to suit their big family.  According to the Journal of Family and Reproductive Health, spontaneous quadruplet pregnancies can only happen somewhere between one in 512,000 to one in 677,000 births. Having two sets of identical twins is an even more exceptional case as both embryos would have had to split after fertilization.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vcGhpbHN0YXJsaWZlLmNvbS9uZXdzLWFuZC12aWV3cy80MzM4MDAtbW9tLWdpdmVzLWJpcnRoLXR3by1zZXRzLWlkZW50aWNhbC10d2luc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"birth","2023-07-14","Not Discerned","{""Fairfield"", ""Connecticut"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T03:34:00","It’s often said that our family is our first classroom, where we learn how to navigate the world around us. An intriguing aspect of this dynamic is the effect of birth order on our personality development. Researchers have long been interested in how being the firstborn, a middle child, or the youngest can shape our character traits and behavior.  This article delves into the profound influence of birth order on personality, providing insight into why siblings may differ dramatically from one another.  Birth Order Theory: The Groundwork  The idea that birth order impacts personality dates back to the early 20th century when the renowned psychiatrist Alfred Adler first proposed this theory. He suggested that the order in which a child is born into a family significantly influences their feelings, behaviors, and ways of relating to the world.  Firstborns: The Responsible Leaders  Firstborns often shoulder the responsibility of being the ‘first’ in many things within a family unit. Parents, especially new ones, tend to be more cautious, strict, and demanding with their first child. As a result, firstborns are often characterized as responsible, reliable, and ambitious. They’re known to be high achievers and natural leaders but may also lean towards perfectionism.  Middle Children: The Diplomatic Peacekeepers  Middle children can often feel squeezed between the pioneering firstborn and the ‘baby’ of the family. They might not receive the undivided attention that the firstborn or youngest gets. This can lead to them becoming incredibly resourceful and independent. Known for their excellent negotiation skills, they’re often good at compromise and are usually peacemakers within the family. However, they might struggle with feelings of not belonging or being overlooked.  Youngest Children: The Charismatic Free Spirits  The youngest children, often labeled the ‘baby’ of the family, typically enjoy more freedom and less responsibility. Parents may be more relaxed in their parenting by the time the last child comes along. Youngest children are often outgoing, charming, and creative, embracing the role of entertainers within their families. However, they can also be perceived as spoiled or overly dependent.  Only Children: The Hybrid  Only children often exhibit traits seen in firstborns, including leadership skills and maturity, given that they are the sole focus of their parents’ attention. However, without siblings, they also might miss out on learning essential negotiating and sharing skills early in life.  Variables and Exceptions  It’s crucial to remember that while birth order provides intriguing trends, it isn’t a definitive blueprint for determining personality. Many other factors come into play, including temperament, gender, age gaps between siblings, family size, cultural background, and parental attitudes. A ten-year age gap between siblings might reset the birth order effect, and the death of a sibling can also change dynamics dramatically.  A Piece of the Personality Puzzle  Birth order is an intriguing lens through which to examine personality development. While it’s not the sole determinant of personality, it can offer valuable insights into why we are the way we are, particularly within our family dynamics. It’s an intricate piece of the vast puzzle that makes up human behavior, continually reminding us of the multifaceted nature of personality development.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcmFnZW5ld3MuY29tL2ZpcnN0Ym9ybi1taWRkbGUtbGFzdC1ob3ctYmlydGgtb3JkZXItMTAxMDUxMS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"birth","2023-10-06","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T23:47:36","Attorneys for the State of Montana have argued that the state should not be held in contempt next week in Yellowstone County District court because lawyers with the state’s Attorney’s General Office believed a unanimous Supreme Court decision handed them, not the American Civil Liberties Union of Montana, “a win.”  In a case that stretches back several years, the 2021 Legislature changed state laws regarding how gender on birth certificates could be changed. Instead of a one-page document that allowed residents to change it, the Department of Public Health and Human Services, under newly-elected Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte, rewrote the rules to require a more onerous process, which included requirement of surgery and a judge’s order.  Two plaintiffs, represented in part by the American Civil Liberties Union of Montana, filed suit and Judge Michael G. Moses stopped the law from going into effect and also ruled that the state must reinstate the 2017 practice adopted during Steve Bullock administration. Bullock was a Democrat.  However, the state argued that Moses’ injunction left Montana without any policy or procedure for changing a birth certificate, so the Department of Public Health and Human Services created a new procedure for changing a birth certificate.  That kicked off another series of court filings in which Moses ordered the department to revert back to the 2017 rule — the last uncontested process before the new law was passed.  Yet attorneys for the state also said that because the 2021 law and the order commanding the department to reinstitute the 2017 procedure were entirely stopped by the court action that it had no other choice but to issue more rules in 2022. Furthermore, state attorneys also argue that Moses’ order and a subsequent appeal to the Montana Supreme Court didn’t address the 2022 rule, and therefore, they were free to adopt a new policy. Attorneys with the state say the department shouldn’t be slapped with contempt.  “The department believed in good faith that it had the authority under its general rulemaking power to promulgate a new rule to fill the void left by the injunction,” said Kathleen Smithgall, Deputy Solicitor General for the State of Montana. “The department viewed the order (by the Supreme Court) as a win for the department’s rulemaking authority.  “Not until plaintiffs’ counsel reached out, demanding to know why the department was not complying with the 2017 rule did the department become aware that plaintiffs had interpreted the Supreme Court’s order differently.”  Instead, it says that since the ACLU did not challenge the 2022 rule-making process that the state continues to have “an obligation to enforce all of its rules.”  In the Montana Supreme Court decision, which was authored by Chief Justice Mike McGrath on behalf of a five-justice panel in January, it said that the original 2017 rule remains in effect for as long as the preliminary injunction remains valid. The preliminary injunction is still in effect.  “The district court found that it had no jurisdiction over the 2022 Rule. However, it further concluded that the 2022 Rule was issued in violation of the Preliminary Injunction Order, which required DPHHS ‘to return to the status quo and therefore . . . to the 2017 DPHHS regulations.’ Nonetheless, the court did not hold DPHHS in contempt,” the Supreme Court decision said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL2RhaWx5bW9udGFuYW4uY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMjIvd2UtdGhvdWdodC13ZS13b24tc3RhdGUtYXJndWVzLWl0LXNob3VsZG50LWJlLWhlbGQtaW4tY29udGVtcHQtZm9yLWJpcnRoLWNlcnRpZmljYXRlLXJ1bGVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Save  Birth weight influences lung function, airway responsiveness  Key takeaways:  The group with low birth weight had reduced expiratory airflow at low lung volume at age 1 month.  The group with high birth weight had increased airway responsiveness at age 12 months.  WASHINGTON — Birth weight influences lung function and airway responsiveness beyond changes in lung size, according to data presented at the American Thoracic Society International Conference.  “Meta-analysis demonstrates a strong inverse association between birth weight and restrictive lung impairment and a weaker association with airflow obstruction,” Kimberley Wang, PhD, senior research fellow, School of Human Sciences, The University of Western Australia, told Healio.  Infants with low birth weight had lower expiratory airflow at low lung volume than those with normal birth weight at 1 month.  “In animals, growth restriction leads to airway wall abnormalities and changes in airway responsiveness,” she continued. “This study, therefore, aims to examine the relationship between birth weight, lung function and airway responsiveness in the Perth Infant Asthma Follow-up (PIAF) Birth Cohort.”  Kimberley Wang  The longitudinal PIAF Birth Cohort comprised 253 infants recruited between 1987 and 1989 from a general antenatal clinic in Perth. There was no preselection for family history of asthma or atopy.  Infants were born at term, defined as 37 weeks or more of gestational age. The researchers categorized low birth weight as less than 2.5 kg, normal birth weight as 2.5 to 4 kg and high birth weight as more than 4 kg.  The researchers also assessed V’maxFRC, which is a measure of expiratory airflow at low lung volume, at age 1, 6 and 12 months with adjustments for body length and airway responsiveness to histamine.  Infants with low birth weight had lower V’maxFRC than those with normal birth weight (P = .034) at 1 month. Infants with high birth weight had increased airway responsiveness compared with the normal birth weight group (P = .012) at 12 months.  At age 6, 11, 18 and 24 years, the researchers assessed airway responsiveness and lung function based on FEV 1 and forced vital capacity (FVC) z scores.  There were positive correlations between birth weight and FEV 1 (P = .017) and FVC (P = .02) at age 11 years. However, the researchers did not find any other relationship between birth weight, lung function and airway responsiveness at any other time point. A doctor diagnosis of asthma was independent of birth weight as well.  “Findings reveal a birth weight effect that extends beyond changes in lung size,” Wang said. “Therefore, airway dysfunction should be considered a precursor rather than a consequence of disease processes.”  Wang encouraged doctors “to follow up with the respiratory health of infants born with either low or high birth weight at least through childhood.”  Next, Wang said, the researchers will work “to understand why and what are the different underlying mechanisms in low vs. high birth weight that contribute to airway dysfunction.”  For more information:  Kimberley Wang, PhD, can be reached at kimberley.wang@uwa.edu.au.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlYWxpby5jb20vbmV3cy9hbGxlcmd5LWFzdGhtYS8yMDIzMDUyMi9iaXJ0aC13ZWlnaHQtaW5mbHVlbmNlcy1sdW5nLWZ1bmN0aW9uLWFpcndheS1yZXNwb25zaXZlbmVzc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Whatever’s taking place down below the carving stations and espresso bars inside the soundproofed Paddock Club at the Jeddah Corniche Circuit, down on a floodlit straightaway of asphalt so eerily pristine that it seems impossible a car has ever touched it, remains an auto-racing-themed abstraction even during a potential outbreak of real excitement. When defending world champion Max Verstappen’s engine failed mid-lap on qualifying night this past March, sending him to the back of the starting grid for the next evening’s grand prix, the image of his stalled race car on an overhead TV screen barely distracted the club level’s courtiers, VIPs, and professional schmoozers from their wagyu steak.  In contrast, cheers sometimes erupted from the opposite grandstand, where a more modest, more sports-focused, and seemingly unrelated event was taking place. That event could be visited by forsaking the wonders of the club lounge and stepping outside. Every few seconds an aeronautical sound-wave would suction the still desert air and a jet engine enclosed in insect skin, piloted by an international sporting celebrity whose face was impossible to see, zoomed by just long enough to hold a flickering perception of the vehicle’s brief physical presence. The brain-pinching whoosh entered through the right ear long before its origin appeared; by the time the whoosh exited the left ear its source was already deep into the unknowable frontier that lay beyond Turn 1. The smell of perfume overwhelmed whatever faint suggestion of combusting organic matter accidentally floated up to the loggia. It was a specifically Saudi perfume, arboreal instead of florid, and like the race car exhaust it had the nose-flooding sweetness of something burning.  The men all wore the perfume, and they were dressed almost exactly the same, in ankle-length, button-up white robes and red-on-white checkerboard headdresses held in place by a scalp-hugging black ring. One of the men I met, I was told, controlled $6 billion in real estate and commercial assets. Another was the son of a very senior diplomat, a man responsible for cutting deals with various problematic neighboring states.  Thanks to one such agreement, a Chinese-negotiated thaw in relations with Iran announced just eight days earlier, there would be no repeat of the ugliness surrounding last year’s grand prix, when Iranian-backed militants launched missiles at Jeddah shortly before the race and nearly succeeded in canceling it. The peace dividend was right here at the Paddock Club—I was told Will Smith was somewhere nearby. A white man with a sweater tied around his neck looked especially lost. Most of the white people on hand, like the European wagyu-slicers and the pair of young blond hostesses speaking Russian to one another, were there to wait on the Saudis, who might have traveled to Sochi or Monaco for an event like this before the race premiered in 2021.  In another reversal of decades of national precedent, the Saudi women were dressed with far greater individuality than the men. Their hair was often worn in long black tresses that streamed below the shoulders of tastefully concealing gowns. In a not-so-distant past, a pricey handbag was a Saudi woman’s only means of flaunting any higher status in public, a realm she could only enter when covered head-to-toe in a black abaya. The abayas are optional now, as are the hijabs. “We’d never imagined we’d be here from five years ago,” said Tala al Jabri, a Riyadh-based and U.S.-educated investor in Saudi-based tech startups, who, like most of the other younger women on hand, looked like she was dressed for a cold day in Beverly Hills.  Among the identically costumed men there is still a Saudi vision of egalitarianism on display, one that obscures everyone’s role and wealth in order to maintain a hierarchical reality. In photos on display at the Murabba Palace museum in Riyadh, King Abdulaziz, also known as Ibn Saud, the founder of the modern Saudi state, is dressed in almost the same robes as his servants. Abdulaziz and his six successors are buried in graves that are nearly unmarked and barely ever visited, in accordance with Salafi practice.  2023 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, JeddahAndrea Bruce  Saudi-style equality—namely, the equality of shared subjecthood, applicable to royals and commoners alike—reigns in one other obvious way at the Paddock Club. No amount of money or power will buy you a single drop of alcohol. “The beer is coming,” an official assured me as we drank guava juice out of sleek glass stemware. “We need it for business, for tourists.” The possible introduction of alcohol into a conservative tribal monarchy of 35 million whose government is responsible for overseeing the two holiest sites in Islam seems a prospect with no easily predictable outcome. But my interlocutor, like the government he worked for, was confident in his read of the current national mentality. “Most Saudis are convinced the alcohol ban is not for a religious reason,” he claimed. “In some schools of Islam, under 5% [alcohol by volume] is acceptable.”  The question of just how much change the Saudi crown can declare without threatening the integrity of the system it built has been dramatically answered in recent years. Since 2016, the palace, under the leadership of 37-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, widely referred to as MBS, has embarked on a bold program of social and economic reform. As Syria and Libya burned, ISIS consolidated control of northern Iraq, and the Egyptian military crushed the country’s brief spell of elected Muslim Brotherhood rule, Saudi women saw the rapid disappearance of such mainstays of national policy as the driving ban, compulsory hijab, male guardianship laws, and employment prohibitions. A nationwide ban on cinemas was lifted in 2018. The once-ubiquitous religious police still technically exist, but they are almost never seen in public anymore and have lost all of their formal powers. Saudi Arabia no longer exports fundamentalist Wahhabi Islam, long its state ideology, and has largely ceased the promotion of Wahhabism even within its own borders. The country began offering tourist visas for the first time in 2019, reversing a long-standing official fear of the contaminations of the outside world.  The palace has courted even greater dangers in the economic realm. The government introduced a value-added tax, essentially the first tax regime in the country’s history, and then raised the rate from 3% to as much as 15% while slashing subsidies on energy and food. The government’s sovereign wealth fund has led a massive shift in state investments, pivoting the public sector away from its usual focus on extractive industries and into new realms like tourism, real estate development, entertainment, logistics, and hazily innovation-related projects involving things like cryptocurrency trading and the construction of a cube-shaped Sim City arcology in central Riyadh.  Old trading families and the once-influential import sector have lost much of their former prominence. “Economic power in the private sector is changing hands,” explained Mohamed Alyahya, a Saudi political commentator and fellow at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government.  The days of the palace using endless supplies of oil money and religious conservatism to drug Saudis into a mutually reinforcing culture of indolence and obedience are over. Share →︎ Twitter Facebook Email Print Link Copied link  MBS’s reforms, whose effects are plainly visible in every area of Saudi life, amount to a wholesale rewriting of the kingdom’s social contract. The days of the palace using endless supplies of oil money and religious conservatism to drug Saudis into a mutually reinforcing culture of indolence and obedience are over. In its place, the population is now meant to derive its sense of direction and meaning from a rebooted idea of Saudiness, while its wealth will now come from exciting new economic sectors. It will be possible for the government to create these sectors now that it has purged the kleptomania of the former order, mostly through the detainment of over 400 allegedly corrupt members of the royal family at the Riyadh Ritz-Carlton in late 2018.  With many of the old subsidies and handouts eliminated, the relationship between the state, the subject, and the market is no longer mediated through oil-financed social bribery: “It is a big mind-shift we’re trying to induce, of becoming productive citizens,” explained a young Saudi woman who worked on the reform package during her career as a private consultant, and is now studying for a graduate degree in the United States. “A productivity mindset, which is the essence of the vision, has been achieved,” she claimed.  The population has thus far accepted MBS’s changes with astounding equanimity—a possible result of having been trained for decades in obedience. There have been no tax riots or bread riots. There was no visible rearguard action by the old order, or at least none that inflamed or incited any divisions within society at large. Saudis went to work as shopkeepers and Uber drivers with little apparent complaint—not that public complaining is socially tolerated or even all that legal in Saudi Arabia—with some treating participation in the new economy as a kind of patriotic duty.  MBS is gambling that the fruits of openness and modernity can be reaped on Saudi terms, and that prosperity, stability, and a recharged, secularized sense of national purpose won’t shatter existing norms or generate dangerous civic appetites. The reforms have created a rising class of ambitious executives, entrepreneurs, and artists, and for now almost everyone seems to accept the idea of a national horizon defined by the wisdom and vision of a single family, and perhaps even a single man. His program has created an atmosphere muggy with floating potential, as the palace carries out an uncertain experiment on tens of millions of people. MBS’s subjects could be the engine and the beneficiaries of the only successful 21st-century governance project in any populous Middle Eastern state—or they could mark the disastrous limits of utopia declared from on high.  The young former consultant who worked on the reforms described them as “fast-paced social nudges, rather than shocks.” Some nudges are less subtle than others, and one of them comes in the form of a vast and mostly empty construction site surrounding an isolated gray slab south of the Jeddah race track. “Here they are building the world’s tallest tower,” a young government official told me, referring to the slab. “Here is the megaproject, downtown Jeddah. It is one of the five megaprojects.”  The word “megaproject” fails to fully capture the awesome scope of reform-era Saudi ambition. Saudi Arabia has become perhaps the only country on earth where the term “gigaproject” is employed without irony. Behind the future downtown was a glorious sunset, yellow fire turning palm trees into arching shadows, with the light breaking through a sky of soft neon blue. There were no human beings anywhere near the deserted base of the future tower, in the empty center of a city of nearly 4 million.  Who will live and work in this high-rising city-within-a-city an hour-and-a-half from Mecca and 10 minutes from the excitement and inconvenience of an annual Formula 1 grand prix? The answer, broadly speaking, is young Saudis, the roughly 40% of the country that’s under the age of 25. “This is going to have a very young population,” promised one official who showed off a model of Diriyah, a city-size planned sector of Riyadh built in traditional clay-colored crenelated north Arabian architecture. If completed, Diriyah will have 500 times the square footage of Manhattan’s Hudson Yards project.  Significant portions of Diriyah, including an attractive dining and retail district opposite the ruins of Turaif, the place where the Saud dynasty was launched in the 18th century, have already been built. The neighborhood-in-progress is where nationalism, development, and high-end consumption have already merged into a tangible whole. An Ivy League-educated Saudi financier in his mid-20s I met suspected that 10 years from now most of his social circle will have relocated to Neom, the futuristic megacity-by-decree planned for an empty stretch of Red Sea coastline 100 miles south of Eilat.  ‘In a not-so-distant past, a pricey handbag was a Saudi woman’s only means of flaunting any higher status in public, a realm she could only enter when covered head-to-toe in a black abaya’Andrea Bruce  There have also been policy “nudges”: For instance, the Saudi government has implemented a new requirement that any company whose largest regional client is the Saudi state must have its Middle East headquarters somewhere inside of Saudi Arabia itself, which is part of a broader attempt to force large corporate offices to relocate from the United Arab Emirates. Other nudges have come in the form of capital, much of it from the government’s $620 billion Public Investment Fund. In another bid to keep young people engaged and employed, the state has taken a marked interest in every manner of tech play, pouring money into online retail and ride-sharing. The Central Bank has started its own “fintech sandbox,” which will make it easier for nontraditional financial institutions to operate in the country, explained Tala al Jabri, the startup investor. “I would not be investing in startups if I didn’t think they had a culture to disrupt markets,” she said as we both ignored the action below us on the Corniche Circuit. “Startups believe the government has their back,” al Jabri continued. “They think they can succeed because they think the government wants them to succeed.”  Many of the big winners of the reforms are private companies working in sectors that the government now prioritizes. This includes defense manufacturing. When I met Hmoud Alshethre, the youthful and modest executive director of alliances at the Riyadh offices of Intra Defense Technologies, he was dressed in the standard-issue white robe, with a model of a handheld drone perched behind him. A succession of large, white South African men came in to briefly interrupt a generously long discussion held over dates, nuts, and an endless supply of lightly spiced Gulf-style coffee. Intra’s small unmanned aircraft can survey the country’s isolated desert frontiers and oil pipelines, which are often the targets of Iranian-backed sabotage.  “We have a very reasonable government here,” Alshethre explained. The ultimate proof of the government’s “reasonableness,” in Alshethre’s telling, was that it had sensed an incipient popular urge for a different kind of life: The reforms are working, he said, because “people are willing to change.” As evidence, he showed me a government smartphone app called Tawakalna, which aggregates every imaginable official document and service. Tawakalna lists your passport information, traffic violations, and vehicular paperwork; the ownership of a car can be transferred through the app, as can power of attorney and commercial registrations. It has copies of your birth certificate and your real estate deeds, your health information, your international travel record, and a digital kiblah for locating the direction of Mecca during prayer. This is a level of government power over the individual that few democratic citizens would tolerate, merged with a logic and seamlessness that few democratic governments seem capable of delivering these days.  But the most important thing about Tawakalna is that it proved Saudis could rapidly accept a digitally based and state-controlled civic existence. “The government could launch an app and assure that 80% of the population would use it,” Alshethre claimed.  Citizens in a democracy, including the elected leadership, must resign themselves to the wondrous and horrible reality that public space is basically unmanageable, and that the state probably can’t forcibly eliminate things one might think are unspeakably evil, like gun ownership or abortion or the fentanyl trade. The Saudi government takes the opposite approach: The state exerts a tight grip over the public realm while respecting its subjects’ traditional sovereignty over the home. Private spaces are still considered sacrosanct—the police don’t go hunting for alcohol or sexual deviancy beyond locked doors, and unless you’re a jihadist, there is no Mukhabarat that seeks to penetrate the inner spaces of your true self. “There are consequences for expression here,” as one Riyadh intellectual put it, “but not for thought. You can think whatever you want.”  Mohammed bin Salman doesn’t pretend to be a Jeffersonian democrat, and nobody pretends to have voted for him. Share →︎ Twitter Facebook Email Print Link Copied link  The system’s essential clarity explains why the Saudi leadership is so convinced that the population will continue to trust in its guidance and vision even as society becomes freer and more exposed to the outside world. There is mass deception at work in most autocracies, which retain the ceremonies of democratic procedure and other performances of civic openness in order to hide which section of the regime or the security services actually holds power—or to create the constant sense of terror that comes with living in a place where the rules are strategically obscured. There are no comparable lies at play in Saudi Arabia, according to Alyahya. “Mohammed bin Salman doesn’t pretend to be a Jeffersonian democrat, and nobody pretends to have voted for him,” he explained.  The system functions not only because of what it can provide, but because the expectations and lines of authority are so clear. They have only gotten clearer lately. I asked Tariq Alhomayed, the former editor of the Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper and a host on Saudi television, about what first made him think the reforms weren’t an illusion or a ploy. There was the consistency of the government’s messaging, Alhomayed replied, along with the speed of new development projects. “But the main thing was the Ritz,” he said.  In the fall of 2018, the new crown prince detained 400 of his relatives at the Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh and pressured nearly all of them to turn over billions of dollars that they had allegedly embezzled from the state. At the time, the Ritz gambit seemed like an arbitrary and maniacal power grab. But much was accomplished. MBS broke the old economic elite, allowing a new one to arise in its place. The Ritz was part of the crown’s indigenization push: The crackdown fell hardest on figures who had expatriated the people’s wealth, spending their money on yachts and fancy real estate far beyond the kingdom’s borders.  The Ritz gambit showed that the crown prince could act decisively against perceived enemies, including within his own family. Some of them had publicly aligned with U.S. intelligence agencies that saw the reforms as a threat to their own longstanding, quasi-corrupt relationships inside the kingdom. The Ritz also encapsulated the sensitivity to the public psyche that has made the reforms so risky and yet successful so far: MBS was announcing to his subjects that their own government had been stealing from them for decades with total impunity—and, by implication, with the blessing of the crown—while also assuring them that the problem was on its way to being solved.  The Ritz itself is an opulent and isolated megacomplex towering over the beige desert fringes of the downtown sprawl. It is built in a Louis XIV aesthetic, the look of late European monarchy, with filigrees and columns and porticos damming the invisible floodwaters. The interior is cladded in especially severe Islamic patterns, stark and eye-straining networks of latticed domes and interlocking geometries. Statues of four white horses on their hind legs rear over the junction between the lobby and the main dining room, proclaiming an innocent tribute to the Arabian stallion as well as the apocalypse.  A Saudi friend who took me to the hotel explained that it had originally been built as a royal guest house, to accompany the pineapple-domed conference center located one compound over. The palace that contained the actual Saudi royal court was nearby too, though it was far enough off the main highway to be unseeable to a casual visitor. In a more-than-symbolic demonstration that the crown didn’t consider itself exempt from the market-bound logic of the reform package, MBS ordered that the free VIP hotel instead be used as a for-profit facility, with the future operator paying a royalty to the government.  It was lunch inside the dining room, where armies of uniformed Filipino and Pakistani migrant laborers, almost all of them men, attended to a cornucopia of global cuisines arrayed across a vast mileage of bars and buffet tables, with the dull desert light pouring through the back windows of a space too massive to see all at once. A bass and guitar murmured while a woman without a hijab sang in French, every element of it a violation of Salafi injunctions regarding music, art, and gender roles. My friend pointed out a middle-aged couple, a woman in a black abaya across from a man whose headdress lacked the usual black ring. This omission symbolized humility before God and served as the local way of announcing yourself as a committed Islamic fundamentalist. A tall glass of a ruby-colored substance accompanied his expensive lunch.  For my friend, this surreal mix of the forbidden and the permitted at the site of MBS’s greatest administrative masterstroke summed up Saudi Arabia’s entire present situation. “The religious guy with fake sangria and a band playing,” he summarized, as he noticed me tapping away at my iPhone notes. “There’s your scene.”  Yet the Ritz turns out to be one of the least representative places in the entire city. Riyadh is the epicenter of the reform era’s goal of reorienting the Saudi economy around technology, services, and internal consumption. As a result, the young people moving back from Dubai or newly returned from Harvard actually have places to go and things to do now—hookah lounges, which offended the sensibilities of the religious conservatives who ran Riyadh for decades, were finally legalized in 2019. There is remarkably good arrabbiata and risotto on offer for $30 a plate, along with English speakers in their mid 20s to eat it with.  read more from tablet saudi arabia  “There’s so much more drama in American social circles than in Saudi social circles,” one lunch companion, a recent Ivy graduate now working in the newly sprouted forest of sky-high squiggles and cantilevers that forms Riyadh’s King Fahad Financial District, recalled of his time back in America. Dressed in the usual white robe, he blamed it all on American dating culture. We were joined by a woman in discrete Western-style dress and no hijab, who was also back from a fancy education stateside and working for an investment bank in Riyadh. “In America,” she said, “you have to watch what you say ... we have to give them tolerance, but there was no tolerance back to us.” Everyone in America, she said, “is super sensitive.” The young man agreed: Educated Americans were in fact so sensitive that they didn’t have the ability to debate anything except by indirection. “In American society you can never say something is bad: You say that it’s bad for children. In Saudi you’d appeal to religion, not to children’s welfare.” In another city we might have been drinking a white wine made for dry and sunny afternoons. At this restaurant our best option was a mysteriously ash-clouded lemonade infused with charcoal. I pointed out that New York City banned activated charcoal as an ingredient in foods and beverages in 2018.  Today, Riyadh is the second-largest city in the Arab Middle East by population, smaller than permanently dysfunctional Cairo and slightly larger than war-rattled Baghdad. After a brief 1960s flirtation with density and walkability overseen by a Greek urban planner, the infinite space of the desert was divided into giant kilometer-by-kilometer squares and the new oil economy ballooned the city into its current endlessness of shopping malls, walled villas, and eight-lane roads. The old downtown, the one place in Riyadh with lively street life, is now a bustling neighborhood of Filipino and Pakistani migrant workers. Everywhere the traffic design verges on the vindictive: The main arteries are split between a tangle of service lanes, protected turning lanes, underpasses, exits, and entries that dismay, flummox, and terrify people who are familiar with it all. Because these highwaylike streets lack any logical turnaround points, it is common to wind up on the wrong side of the road and have 20 minutes added to your journey.  Given the psychic stress of just getting around, it is a miracle, or perhaps a triumph of tribal-based desert social solidarity, that the people of Riyadh are so unfailingly easygoing and so lacking in any visible suspicion or aggressiveness once they’re off the roads. It is perhaps the only major Middle Eastern city where bargaining in the souks feels impolite.  In Riyadh the current lack of dedicated public space, along with Salafism’s hostility toward any shared public aesthetic experience, has displaced much of the artistic energy into interior design. Riyadh is glutted with sleekly decorated coffee shops that don’t open until the early afternoon, and sometimes not until the late afternoon, since the city is nocturnal even in the winter. There are a conspicuous number of kitchen supply stores; the souks offer elaborate jewelry that’s barely ever worn in public, along with oceans of perfume and incense. It is an economy set up around things a visitor will not see unless they’re invited into a private home.  The public Riyadh is a pale outer layer of the private city, which is an almost complete inversion of life in New York, or even in Cairo. The homes themselves are inscrutable from the outside, walled-off domains with servants, endless coffee services, and majlises, courtlike traditional living rooms where friends and family lounge for hours on elegant floor cushions. Among the Riyadhi elite, it is common to have an entire separate, villa-size majlis where nobody actually lives.  The visible security presence in Riyadh is light both by regional standards and any standard, although things like the total public absence of alcohol or the state-mandated calorie counts on every single restaurant menu confirms the authorities’ thoroughgoing control. There are plentiful signs of an enduring conservatism, like separate women’s entrances for banks (newly optional), curtained-off booths at restaurants, and a relative lack of mixed company even at the hipper and newer coffee houses. The reforms have not yet destroyed the existing social system. And yet, they are meant to turn Saudis into workers and taxpayers, and to change their attitudes toward everything from romance to art to foreign travel.  Perhaps MBS’s project goes even further than that. In JAX, a government-created arts warehouse district near Diriyah, there is an elaborate exhibition previewing Neom, the planned city under construction on the northwestern coast of the Red Sea. Most of its millions of projected inhabitants will live in The Line, a single 100-mile structure, 660-by-1,500 feet, extending into the desert. What will be contained within it is scarcely imaginable, even by teams of world-renowned architects. The concept models at the JAX exhibition are baffling entanglements of walkways, staircases, upside-down skyscrapers and parkland stretching toward an uncannily indoor vanishing point. “This is a cognitive city that will not only adapt to your needs but learn to anticipate them,” a soft and robotic female voice promised during an introductory video. It is “a portal connecting the digital and the physical, conceived by the visionary mind of his highness, Mohammed bin Salman.”  Charlie Puth and Swedish House Mafia concert, 2023 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix after-party, JeddahAndrea Bruce  There were no houses of worship depicted in The Line, no women in hijabs, no men in robes walking among the indoor rivers and hanging towers. Present-day Saudi Arabia is car country, but in Neom the whole city is on a single train line, and everything is meant to be walkable within 15 minutes. In The Line, your community would be defined by the people you lived near, not by your family or your origins.  “In essence, we are building a newly composed biome,” one video informed me. What, if anything, did this mean, and was it meant to mean anything? Would the cantilevered parks become a suicide hazard? There couldn’t be anything less Saudi than The Line, I thought, a place with no walled villas, a dream in the mind of an obscured, humanized God, the god of architects or urban planners, or maybe of especially grandiose kings. Even Diriyah, despite its traditional-style architecture, represents a stark rejection of spacious homes walled off from forbidding highways—the kinds of places where the children might stick around until they get married—in favor of denser blocks of apartments and single-family houses. Diriyah will be connected to downtown Riyadh by a thick greenbelt planted with 20 million trees, which will have a pedestrian and bicycle highway named after the crown prince. Six million of those trees have already been planted, I was told.  In my discussions with Saudi officials, they always emphasized the speed of the reforms: The idea is to fund a massive economic and social transition while oil is still in high demand, and then build an entirely new economy in time for the 40% of the population that’s now under 25-years-old to actually have something meaningful and productive to do with their lives. Part of the reason Saudi Arabia signed on to the recent Chinese-brokered diplomatic normalization with Iran was to pause the onslaught of Tehran-supported drone, missile, and cyber attacks against the kingdom, securing the peaceful conditions under which the crown’s development package could be implemented. Several officials pointed out to me that speed was important because it meant the changes could rapidly become tangible to ordinary Saudis. This marked another curious instance of the monarchy showing a kind of backhanded concern for what its subjects think: The government recognizes that its citizens will not automatically trust that the country is changing unless they can see the changes themselves.  In Riyadh, Saudis can experience the permanence and seriousness of the reforms at Boulevard World, an Epcot-like circuit of nationally themed zones circling an ameboid artificial lake. I walked around it gobsmacked for hours, listening to tabla players at the fake Taj Mahal, watching a costumed procession through fake Morocco, dangling in a cable car over the robin’s egg domes of fake Greece, and perusing the Naruto figurines in fake Japan. I considered eating at the Nathan’s Famous in fake America, beneath the Golden Gate Bridge. In Dubai, the malls and theme parks are pitched at tourists, but at Boulevard World I went long spells without seeing even one other Westerner. Entire large families were out together, the adults in robes and abayas. Any dating was so discreet as to be invisible.  At AREA15, an amusement park version of a warehouse rave located a few buildings over from a fake Mayan pyramid, women in abayas and their robe-clad husbands watched a hijab-less female DJ bop to a bass-heavy mix of an Arabic wedding song. Strobes and lasers flashed. The turntable podium helpfully read “AREA15 Riyadh,” perhaps so that Instagrammers might broadcast to their countrymen and to the rest of the world that yes, this really is happening—the changes are real, or else this wouldn’t be possible.  Like so much else in reform-era Saudi Arabia, Boulevard World is credited to the unique vision of some prince or another. It was built in a mere 81 days according to Ahmed Al Mehmadi, the chief marketing and communications officer for the Saudi Arabian government’s General Entertainment Authority. We met in the back of a hotel conference hall that had been converted into a vast office during Riyadh Season, an annual series of events focused on the capital during the milder winter months. There were “14 zones of activation” during Riyadh Season, Al Mehmadi explained. Behind him was row after row of young adults in a mix of Western and Middle Eastern business-casual dress whose age seemed to average out to 25 at most.  Al Mehmadi, raised partly in London and educated in Riyadh, wore a long white robe, and had a prayer rug and a small statuette of a white Arabian stallion on his desk. Boulevard World, he said, was home to the world’s largest statue of Grendizer, a character from a globally popular anime franchise that he’d loved as a child in Saudi Arabia in the ’90s.  I asked Al Mehmadi if there was some deeper message to Boulevard World. Maybe the place is telling Saudis not to fear other nations or cultures after a long spell of paranoiac conservative governance? It was much simpler than that, Al Mehmadi replied. “We’re telling people you can enjoy your life, you can enjoy being here.”  Saudis didn’t have to travel to Dubai to go to a theme park anymore. And no one had forced anyone to go to Boulevard World—this was something Saudis had apparently already wanted, and the government had now given it to them. By this point, “People are used to a certain way of living,” Al Mehmadi said of the reforms. “It can’t go back.”  For now, the Saudi system has brought newfound normalcy to 35 million people in a time when the Arab republics collapsed into mayhem and every regional democratization effort foundered, backslid, or failed. But even if the reforms stick, at some point, maybe 30 years from now—which is both a long time and also less time than it seems—the majority of Saudis will have no strong memory of how oppressive their country used to be. For the reforms to have really been successful, those future Saudis will have to believe in the monarchy for reasons other than the half-forgotten opening of an earlier generation. Something larger has to endure.  To that end, a multi-square-kilometer dust pit east of downtown Riyadh, now a construction site of terrifyingly Pharaonic scope, will be the location of King Salman Park. A futuristic collection of museums and cultural institutions called the Royal Arts Complex will run through the park’s central axis. The government has already launched two arts biennales, one held under the canopies of the former hajj terminal at the Jeddah airport, and one in the desert city of al-Ula, near a notable collection of ancient Nabatean ruins. A cultural ecosystem, along with a burgeoning local fine art market, has been decreed into existence. “If you’re developing an arts sector,” one government official pointed out, “a biennale is the end of the value chain.”  ‘People are used to a certain way of living. It can’t go back.’Andrea Bruce  Art existed in Saudi Arabia before the reforms, just as art has existed in every human context across all of time. As the internationally known Saudi artist Abdulnasser Gharem explained to me, a would-be artist in his country used to encounter the paradoxes of the state’s fundamentalist ideology even as a young child. “From the first day of elementary school, when they were teaching us to practice the execution of images in schoolbooks,” he recalled, “we had to draw a line across the necks of all creatures with a soul, and the heads of images of animals and people. The teachers said: To create an image is the job of Allah. If you leave it to exist, you are going to be punished and go to hell. I was only 6 years old. And I was wondering why I had to do this, because those images were there on the paper. The government had printed them.”  Gharem joined the military to “hide from being an artist,” he told me. He spent 25 years as an armory and supply specialist and retired as a lieutenant colonel. Then he became perhaps the leading conceptual artist in Saudi Arabia, someone who gained global renown while working within the strict limits of a system he intimately knew, and to which he remained loyal. A decade before the reforms, his ghostly photographs of the mushroom-topped, nonnative trees that were often planted along city streets became a comment on how unnatural, constructed, and imposed the national commons had become. In another photo from the early 2000s, a Quranic word meaning “path” repeatedly appeared on a bridge where villagers had died during a flash flood, sheltering there on the advice of a local sheikh. Obedience can either rescue you or kill you, the work suggested.  Gharem’s studio is in a high-ceilinged villa in a Riyadh neighborhood that had been trendy in the ’60s and ’70s, during the city’s initial period of rapid expansion. The house has a crystalline wall of high windows, a cactus garden, and that most essential of Riyadh amenities, a wall that blocks any view from the outside. In the studio there are intriguing mounds of found objects awaiting some artistic use. Why the pile of antique luggage? “I was in the military for 25 years,” was Gharem’s full explanation. A multivolume set of religious texts, the ones where the spines combine to spell out a Quranic phrase in Arabic, sat near books dedicated to the works of Richard Serra, Ai Weiwei, and James Turrell. Gharem himself had a wiry frame and bushy gray hair. He wore turquoise shoes and a florid button-up shirt, and smoked liberally.  “I belong to freedom of thought more than freedom of expression,” Gharem explained. “The freedom of thought is a human right, and a person’s free actions occur primarily in the mind and not in nature.  “As an artist,” he added, “you can’t fall back on where you belong.”  Thanks to the reforms, someone like Gharem, who believes that an artist can never become overly captive to their surroundings or to their own identity, is now in the strange position of having to be skeptical of something that’s directly helped him. “You can be an artist—not hiding like before,” he said of the changes he’s seen since 2016. “The government gives us infrastructure we never would have dreamed of when we were young.” In an earlier time, “You never would’ve told your neighbor you were taking your daughter to a private piano teacher.  “Today we are living a grand narrative: The enlightenment that we were waiting for has begun from within,” he continued. “Despite the fact that some perceive it as a harsh enlightenment, there is great progress.”  ‘The great majority of Saudis still didn’t know who Swedish House Mafia was, but there were relatively privileged teenagers on hand whose lives would probably never be the same again.’Andrea Bruce  Dubai, the Gulf’s reigning logistics and financial hub and one of the Middle East’s few real bastions of cosmopolitanism, is often seen as the value proposition for what a more liberal Saudi Arabia could be. But one important commonality between Dubai and whatever Saudi Arabia is becoming is that neither are democratic accomplishments. What disturbs an American visitor about Riyadh, and Dubai for that matter, is the possibility that for the time being, liberal idealism has little it can credibly add to the market-driven vision of order, harmony, and ambition that surrounds them. The enlightenment might be harsh. Did that mean it couldn’t also be real?  After the Formula 1 qualifier was over, there was an after-party where Charlie Puth performed in front of tens of thousands of teenagers cloaked in darkness. No, this wasn’t some different and less-famous person named Charlie, I realized shortly after arriving midset. One of the world’s biggest pop stars and TikTok icons seemed to really be enjoying himself up there, dressed in a red leather jacket with cream-colored sleeves. “Your food is the best food I’ve ever had in the entire world,” he gushed, with visible surprise at how nonmedieval his host country had proved to be. He read signs in the crowd between numbers: “‘Hii, with two i’s. Yes, hello!” He sang “Loser,” a song about dating and alcohol abuse, here in a dry country where quasi-arranged marriages are still common. “Thanks for being one of the most impressive crowds we’ve ever played for,” he beamed. Next up was Swedish House Mafia, who headlined Coachella last year. “I don’t know how they’re going to dance to Swedish House Mafia without any drinks,” wondered a Frenchman watching next to me on the VIP deck, before correctly predicting that Sergio Perez would win the next day’s grand prix.  The robe people, the well-connected types in their mid-30s, dominated the sedate and uncrowded club section, which loomed over a festival-sized pit. I set out for the lower shadows, curious as to which Saudis belonged in the less rarified strata of concertgoers. What I saw were thousands of young people practicing at being mirror images of American teens: The boys wore Death Row Records hoodies and fake Balenciaga, and I spotted dew rags, tight leather jackets, cornrows, and a shirt coated in black sequins. Travis Scott, popular in Saudi Arabia, was headlining the post-race show the next night.  The girls mostly wore jeans; exposed belly buttons were about as common as hijabs, which is to say the number of both was noticeably higher than zero. There was plentiful, unashamed mixed company, although I did see a couple jerk their heads away from each other mid-kiss, realizing they were now under the floodlights near the exit of the hulking amphitheater. What will happen in a few years when half the guys here are drunk? I wondered. Maybe half of them were already drunk and their cultural environment had made them adept at keeping it secret. It was awfully dark up front.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhYmxldG1hZy5jb20vc2VjdGlvbnMvaXNyYWVsLW1pZGRsZS1lYXN0L2FydGljbGVzL2JpcnRoLW9mLWEtbmF0aW9uLXNhdWRpLWFyYWJpYS1hcm1pbi1yb3NlbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Key Takeaways  Pregnant women who had a high level of insulin resistance according to their triglyceride and glucose (TyG) index prior to 20 weeks' gestation showed improved glucose metabolism, a reduced risk for gestational diabetes, and significantly fewer preterm births when treated daily with an oral fiber supplement for 5 weeks (gestational weeks 20-24) compared with untreated controls in a single-center, randomized study with 295 women.  The fiber supplement intervention did not affect lipid profiles or other maternal and neonatal outcomes.  Why This Matters  Women who develop gestational diabetes are at risk for maternal and perinatal complications and for type 2 diabetes later in life.  High TyG index in the first trimester is associated with gestational diabetes development.  Improving glucose metabolism in women with a high TyG index during pregnancy might help prevent gestational diabetes.  Study Design  The study randomly assigned 295 women with a TyG index ≥ 8.5 before 20 weeks' gestation seen at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Shanghai General Hospital during June 2021 to July 2022.  During gestational weeks 20-24, 97 women received a 12-g dose of oral dietary fiber powder twice daily, and 197 served as controls and received usual care without the fiber supplement. All participants received guidance on how to optimize diet and activity. Forty-six women either dropped out or were lost to follow-up prior to delivery.  Participants underwent a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test at 25-28 weeks' gestational age and also underwent additional testing.  Key Results  The incidence of gestational diabetes among women in the group who ingested the fiber supplement was 11.2%, significantly less than the 23.7% rate among women who served as controls.  The average 2-hour blood glucose levels during the oral glucose tolerance test was 6.45 mmol/L among the women using the fiber supplement and 6.69 mmol/L among the control group, a significant difference.  The researchers found no significant differences in levels of fasting blood glucose, 1-hour blood glucose, lipid profiles, or TyG index between the treatment groups.  Pre- and post-intervention weight and body mass index values showed no significant differences between the two treatment groups.  Mean gestational age at delivery among women who received the fiber supplement was 39.07 weeks, significantly greater than the 38.58-week average among the controls.  The incidence of preterm delivery at less than 37 weeks was 2.3% among women who used the fiber supplement, significantly less than the 9.4% rate among the controls.  Limitations  This was a single-center, pilot study that involved a relatively small number of women.  Intervention with supplemental dietary fiber was for only 5 weeks during pregnancy.  Disclosures  The study received no commercial funding.  None of the authors had disclosures.

"birth","2020-07-24","Not Discerned","{""Philadelphia"", ""Pennsylvania"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T14:37:03","The United States has experienced a rapid decline in its fertility rate, starting with the Great Recession and declining further since then. Since 2008, the U.S. fertility rate fell from 2.1—right at replacement rate—to a record low of 1.6 births in 2020.REF  Research at the University of Pennsylvania and McGill University suggests that two factors contributing to the falling birth rate are the decline in marriage and an increase in women’s educational attainment.REF Since 2006, marriage rates have declined by 15.9 percent among women ages 25 to 29.REF Married women are three percentage points more likely to have a child than their unmarried counterparts and are drastically less likely to have an abortion.REF Meanwhile, women’s bachelor’s degree attainment rose by 10 percent over the past decade and the total fertility rate of women with bachelor’s degrees was 37 percent lower than the fertility rate of women with high school degrees in 2019.REF The fact that fertility rates fall as women’s education and incomes rise suggests that opportunity costs—not a lack of income—is driving fertility declines, and that improved options for combining family and careers would increase family formation and raise the fertility rate.  Creating the conditions for family flourishing, including conditions that support increasing the married birth rate, require new approaches to early childhood education and care, advanced education, and workforce policies. Couples will be more likely to have the number of children they desire if they can be confident that they will have good and affordable educational options for those children. Current and prospective parents need confidence that they will have:  Flexible childcare and work arrangements;  Safe and effective K–12 options that align with their values;  Higher-education opportunities that provide multiple, cost-effective routes to climbing the ladder of upward economic mobility; and  A thriving economy that provides flexible work options for parents to maximize their ability to care and provide for their children.  Flexible Work Options  Work decisions affect marriage and children, and vice versa. Concerns that getting married and having children could disrupt career goals and that children are too expensive can cause some people to forgo or put off marriage and to decide not to have children or to have fewer than they would otherwise have. A 2018 poll by the Cato Institute found that workplace flexibility is parents’ top priority for balancing work and family life, with 58 percent of parents saying that flexible work schedules, remote work, and part-time work would be the best way to help them to balance work and family.REF  While “having it all”—successful careers for both parents and the perfect family situation all at the same time—may not always be realistic, increasingly family-friendly workplace policies and a surge in flexible work options have made it possible for people to have more of the work and family balance they desire. A recent economic analysis found that remote work increased family formation and fertility rates.REF Over the past five years, the number of workers with access to paid family leave increased by 67 percent. And a surge in independent work options—which include contracting, freelancing, gig work, and self-employment—have made it possible for more people to be their own bosses.REF This is especially valuable to parents who want and need more control over their schedules. Independent workers report greater work-life balance, less stress, and better health, with the same, or higher, incomes as traditional employment—all of which make it easier for people to have the families they desire.REF  Supporting Parents’ Preferences in Early Childhood Education and Care. Access to childcare that meets parents’ preferences and needs can increase the chances that would-be parents choose life over abortion and can help to enable couples to have the number of children they desire. Direct parental, spousal, or extended family care has always been parents’ top preference for childcare, and policies supporting those preferences should be prioritized. Indeed, the COVID-19 pandemic appears to have intensified the desire for family care over center-based childcare, which has become more possible through flexible work arrangements and remote work allowing some people to move closer to family.  According to a 2021 survey by the Institute for Family Studies that asked parents of small children up to age four about their ideal work and childcare arrangement, 31 percent of parents prefer that parents work flexible hours and share childcare duties; 28 percent prefer that one parent stays home full time to care for children; 14 percent prefer that a relative cares for children; 14 percent prefer that one parent stays home part-time while using part-time childcare; 11 percent prefer using full-time center-based childcare; and 4 percent prefer that a nanny cares for children.REF  Current childcare regulations drive up costs and limit the supply of childcare providers, which has especially hurt small in-home family providers that are far more affordable than center-based childcare. In addition to the costs of converting one’s home into a childcare facility and of keeping up with tedious regulations,REF a study of Illinois licensed in-home providers found that they spend 18 hours per week performing unpaid administrative work in addition to 51 hours per week providing paid childcare.REF Not surprisingly, the number of small in-home childcare providers plummeted by 52 percent between 2005 and 2017.REF  For lower-income earners, affordable childcare choices can reduce the financial strain that factors into decisions to have children. For higher-income and more educated workers who have lower fertility rates, the assurance of flexible childcare options can reduce concerns—particularly for mothers—that having children would force them to choose between disrupting their careers and placing their children in undesirable childcare.  Education Choice for All Families  Married couples may also delay having children over concerns about the quality of elementary and secondary schools that would be available to them. From academic concerns and anxiety about curricular content about race or “gender” to physical safety, families have a range of questions about whether district public schools align with their values and their children’s needs and well-being.  Young families, low-income families, and middle-income families may not be able to afford private school tuition as an alternative to public schools, especially when it means paying for school twice: once in property and other taxes as payment to the district school and a second time for private school tuition. Funding families directly through education choice options, such as education savings accounts (ESAs), tax credit scholarships, or vouchers can ensure that all children can attend schools that align with their parents’ values, that are safe, and that provide a solid education.  A growing number of states now have education choice options. As of May 2023, 14 states have ESAs or ESA-style accounts, 15 have vouchers, and 21 give families access to tax credit scholarships. (See Appendix Table 1 for a full list of programs by state.)  Parents who have access to such private school choice are more satisfied with their children’s educational experiences.REF Increased parental satisfaction is likely a function of the many benefits of school choice that have been demonstrated empirically. Those include improved academic achievement outcomes;REF increased graduation rates;REF positive effects on civic engagement;REF reduced crime;REF improved student safety;REF and positive impacts on character as seen in outcomes, such as increased charitable giving,REF positive effects on tolerance of others,REF increased political participation,REF and higher levels of voluntarism.REF School choice also has statistically significant positive effects on reductions in paternity suits,REF potentially signaling a decrease in out-of-wedlock births. School choice has an impact on family dynamics, enabling parents, as University of Arkansas professor Patrick Wolf has identified, “to move from the margins to the centers of their child’s educational experience.”REF Finally, and perhaps most important, research indicates that children attending private schools, especially religious schools, are more likely to get married as adults, and more likely to stay married.REF  The benefits of education choice accrue to some of the most important aspects of families’ lives and could increase the marital birth rate.  Teaching Students the Success Sequence in School  Access to values-based education can also reinforce the importance of family, marriage, and the “success sequence.” As Ron Haskins and Isabel Sawhill at the Brookings Institution have noted, the success sequence is the term for research demonstrating that graduating high school, getting a job, and getting married before having children significantly reduces the likelihood of an individual ending up in poverty. Following that sequence creates a substantial hedge against poverty, as evidenced by the fact that 97 percent of millennials who follow it were not poor when they reached adulthood.REF Children in private schools, particularly those that are faith-based, are more likely to hear about the benefits of marriage and the positive outcomes of the success sequence.  Schools have a role to play (both public and private) by presenting data about success sequence outcomes to students. A nationally representative survey of parents conducted by the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) in 2021 found that parents agree, with 76 percent supporting schools teaching the sequence. Notably, a full 70 percent of those respondents who had not followed the sequence themselves, as evidenced by the fact that they had not completed high school, were unemployed, or had children out of wedlock, also supported teaching the success sequence to students.REF Responses to the AEI survey closely mirrored those of a nationally representative survey of parents commissioned by The Heritage Foundation and conducted by Braun Research, also in 2021. Among parent respondents, 72 percent agreed that schools should explicitly teach the success sequence, as did 60 percent of school board members.REF  Public schools might simply present the data on success sequence outcomes to students, and all schools should be more intentional about preparing students for family life. Students need to know, in particular, the family facts of life: namely, that having and rearing children in marriage maximizes the economic, educational, and emotional welfare of men, women, and, especially, children.REF  There is a 13-percentage-point difference in students living in two-parent households between those who attend public versus private schools. Approximately 68 percent of children who attend public schools (averaging assigned and chosen public schools) live in two-parent households, compared to 81 percent of students who attend private schools.REF Although a causal connection cannot be made between the two, and selection bias certainly factors into those figures (married parent families are more likely to have the means to send their children to private school, for example), there is an association. As such, private schools may also be modeling a key component of the success sequence, something parents should consider when determining which types of school are more likely to foster both marriage and having children within marriage.  Using Markets—Not Taxpayer-Forced Loan Cancellation—to Reduce Student Loan Debt  Student loan debt is another frequently cited reason for delaying childbearing. In 2006, 30.6 percent of women over the age of 25 had a bachelor’s degree; by 2019, that figure had risen to 40.7 percent.REF Along with this increase has come an increase in student loan debt. Over that same period, outstanding student loan debt increased from approximately $545 billion to nearly $1.7 trillion.REF Media frequently relay stories of couples postponing childbearing due to student loan payments.  Although these aggregate figures are eye-popping, they are modest when considered at the individual level. The majority of college graduates exit with less than $20,000 in debt, and the median monthly student loan payment is $222.REF Nevertheless, some married couples may have considerable college debt that influences their decision to have children.  One can sympathize with borrowers who were given the impression by guidance counselors, the elite media, and government actors that their only way to climb the ladder of upward economic mobility was by attending a brick-and-mortar college to obtain a bachelor’s degree and to delay marriage until they fully establish themselves in the workforce. Part of the equation for increasing the married birth rate must solve for this problem; industry and policy alike must move away from the bachelor’s degree being the sole proxy for employability.  Congress must also eliminate open-ended federal subsidies (student loans and grants) that accrue largely to the benefit of institutions, which can raise tuition and capture additional spending, passing the cost along to student consumers. Reforms within the higher education sector should include eliminating federal PLUS loans, allowing colleges to cap borrowing, and requiring universities to have some “skin in the game” for a portion of the cost of student loan defaults. Coupled with changes to the ossified accreditation system, these reforms could dramatically reduce the cost of college and ultimately the debt loads of future borrowers, easing one perceived obstacle to increasing the married fertility rate.  At the same time, Congress should prevent future student debt cancellation. Forcing people without college degrees—who tend to have more children—to pay for the loans of individuals with degrees and with fewer or no children will only make it harder for lower-income and middle-income families to have and support the number of children they would like.REF  Lower-Cost, More Effective Education and Workforce Development  Education and experience help people to achieve stable work and rising incomes that can encourage and support marriage and children. Research shows that employment provides people—low-income fathers, in particular—with financial stability and responsibility that make them more attractive as partners and thus more likely to get married. Ample work options and rising incomes can help to enable couples to have and to provide for as many children as they want.  Massive federal subsidies for higher education have had the opposite of their intended effect, causing costs to riseREF and crowding out more effective and affordable education options like apprenticeships and employer-provided programs that can lead to successful careers.  A 2021 Brookings Institution report noted that the process for employers to establish apprenticeship programs is excessively onerous and concluded that “[a] robust apprenticeship system has the potential to increase earnings and reduce occupational segregation in the labor market.”REF Moreover, a 2017 Harvard study estimated that the number of occupations commonly filled through apprenticeships could nearly triple (from 27 to 74), that the number of job openings filled through apprenticeships could expand eight-fold (to 3.2 million), and that the occupations ripe for apprenticeship expansion could offer 20 percent higher wages than traditional apprenticeship occupations.REF Yet, government-monopolized Registered Apprenticeship Programs are concentrated in legacy trades—a problem compounded by the fact that the Biden Administration cancelled the flourishing new Industry-Recognized Apprenticeship Programs that were helping to fill in-demand jobs like nursing. These actions are preventing more students from having the opportunity to gain on-the-job education for a successful career while getting paid, instead of paying for costly tuition.  Moreover, federal job-training programs consistently fail to provide workers with education and experience that helps them to find and retain jobs.REF For example, only 32 percent of participants in the government’s program that is designed to train workers for in-demand jobs found occupations in their area of training and individuals receiving the full workforce training were less likely to obtain health insurance or pension benefits, their households earned several thousand dollars less, and they were more likely to be on food stamps than participants who received minimal services.REF And, at a taxpayer cost of $25,000 per participant, the Job Corps youth training program reduced students’ likelihood of earning a high school diploma, had no effect on college attendance or completion, and led to only $22 more per week in earnings.REF  By contrast, research shows that young men who have gone through career-based education, such as apprenticeship programs, are more likely to be earning and working more than their peers with similar backgrounds and are more likely to be married as younger adults.REF Evidence supports common intuition—young working men are simply more “marriageable.”  Recommendations for State and Federal Policymakers  To support married couples having more children, state policymakers should:  Teach the Success Sequence. Among young adults who follow the success sequence—finish high school, enter the workforce or attend college first, and get married prior to having children—97 percent are not in poverty.REF States should adopt laws adding the success sequence to their family life education standards, showcasing data illuminating the value of graduation, work, and marriage for young adults and their families.  Reduce Unnecessary Regulations on Childcare and Preschool Providers. Childcare licensing and regulations have set an increasingly high barrier to establishing and maintaining home-based childcare. Not surprisingly, the number of small in-home childcare providers—which tend to be more flexible and cost about 25 percent less than center-based childcare—plummeted by 52 percent between 2005 and 2017.REF To increase access to more flexible and affordable childcare, state policymakers should eliminate unnecessary regulations, such as unnecessary degree requirements, that do not significantly improve the quality of care.  Adopt Universal Education Savings Accounts (ESAs). States should follow the lead of Arizona, West Virginia, Iowa, Arkansas, and Utah and adopt universal education choice options for families. Arizona, in particular, established the model universal ESA program, which deposits a portion of the money that would have been spent on a child in public school into a parent-controlled account. Parents can then use those funds for any education-related purpose, including private school tuition, online learning, special education services and therapies, private tutors, home schooling, textbooks and curricula, and a host of other services. Unused funds can even be rolled over from year to year and can be rolled into a college savings account.  To support married couples having more children, Congress should:  Amend the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) to Enable More Employer-Provided Childcare. Under the FLSA, employers who provide any kind of onsite childcare or childcare subsidies must include the value of those benefits in employees’ “regular rate” of pay calculations.REF This complicates and increases employers’ costs because, instead of simply paying an hourly worker who is subject to overtime laws 1.5 times the wage for overtime, employers must calculate a different, higher wage rate that includes the hourly value of childcare benefits, and then multiply that amount by 1.5 for overtime hours. Since childcare subsidies are typically fixed and do not increase with overtime, they should not be included in the overtime wage calculation. Congress should amend the FLSA to treat childcare subsidies the same as other workplace benefits, such as retirement contributions and health and life insurance, which are excluded from workers’ “regular rate” of pay calculations.  Not Impede Businesses from Offering Flexibility and Remote-Work Options. The best thing that policymakers can do to enable more family-friendly workplaces and flexible work opportunities is to refrain from impeding innovation that makes flexible and remote work possible for workers. This flexibility is often key for parents looking for options that allow them to juggle work and family responsibilities. A pending Department of Labor regulation on independent contractor status threatens to take away flexible and remote options for tens of millions of workers. In California, entire professions of freelance workers have lost their livelihoods.REF And an expected regulation to raise the wage threshold for salaried employees would cause many employers to prohibit remote work for hourly workers.REF  Codify in Law a Bright-Line Test for Employee vs. Independent Contractor Status. Many workers—especially parents—desire independent contracting work that allows them to be their own bosses and work remotely and with flexible hours. But current ambiguity and conflicting definitions across federal statute—including a pending regulation to drastically restrict independent contracting—impede work opportunities that allow parents to better balance raising families and earning incomes. Congress should codify a single bright-line test for independent contractor status under federal lawsREF based on the “common law” control test.REF  Allow Low-Income Private-Sector Workers to Choose Between Paid Time Off and Overtime Pay. The Working Families Flexibility Act would allow private-sector employers to offer their hourly workers the choice between accumulating time-and-a-half paid time off and receiving time-and-a-half pay when they work overtime hours.REF This would particularly help lower-wage workers to accrue paid family leave.  Enable More Remote-Work Opportunities and Workplace Flexibility by Amending Overtime Regulations. Labor laws require that most hourly employees as well as salaried employees who make less than about $36,000 a year (about $28 an hour) are generally required to be paid 1.5 times their normal rate for any hours over 40 that they work in a given week. Employers are understandably reticent to allow workers who are subject to overtime rules to work remotely because they cannot easily monitor their work. For example, at least one employment law firm advised its clients to prohibit workers who make less than the overtime threshold from accessing company e-mail and computer systems remotely, meaning that everything must be done in person, and a sick child at home means that the individual does not have the option of earning income remotely.REF  Moreover, it can be prohibitively costly for employers to allow overtime-eligible workers the flexibility of shifting some of their hours from one week to another because that could cost the employer 50 percent more for the same work. The Department of Labor’s (DOL’s) Wage and Hour Division should abandon its plans to issue a higher overtime salary threshold in the spring of 2023. A higher threshold would force more workers to become subject to overtime laws and thus less likely to be able to work remotely or to have flexible hours. This would particularly hurt parents. The DOL should not raise the threshold and Congress should instead amend the FLSA to expand access to workplace flexibility by allowing employers to calculate overtime over two-week or four-week periods.  Allow Portability of Federal Head Start Funding. The research on Head Start is mixed at best when it comes to children’s cognitive, social-emotional, or health outcomes. Moreover, at a cost of about $12,500 per child, Head Start costs as much or more than most full-time childcare options and yet its limited hours fail to provide a childcare solution for most working parents. Given all this, Congress should allow eligible families to take their share of Head Start funding to an early-childhood education and childcare provider of choice by converting the money currently spent per pupil into family-controlled ESAs.REF  Provide School Choice for Families with Existing Federal Funding. Congress should also allow parents to take their share of existing federal education spending to education providers of their choice. Specifically, Congress should allow funding under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (for students in low-income school districts)REF and funding authorized under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act for students with special needs to follow children to schools and education providers of choice.REF At the same time, Congress should provide children of active-duty military families with ESAs to allow them to attend education options of choice, rather than being assigned to the public school nearest their parent’s assigned military base.REF Native American children attending Bureau of Indian Affairs schools (the worst-performing schools in the nation) should also be allowed to receive ESAs to attend a school of choice.REF Additionally, as Washington, DC, is under the jurisdiction of Congress, it should be converted to an all-choice district through the adoption of universal ESAs.REF  Enact Universal Savings Accounts (USAs). One of the things that prevents people—particularly lower-income workers—from saving in tax-free accounts is the fear that if they need the money to repair a broken-down car or to cover unusually high energy bills, it will be hard to access it and they will have to pay a penalty. USAs, which can be used for many key family expenses—paid family leave, children’s care and education, retirement, and unexpected events—have proven highly successful at increasing savings, especially among lower-income earners, in places like Canada, South Africa, and the U.K.REF Congress should enact USAs so that families can save in a single, simple account for all their child and family needs.  End Federal PLUS Loans. The PLUS Loan program allows parents of undergraduate students and graduate students (since 2008) to borrow from the federal government up to the full cost of attendance at a university. Evidence suggests that this virtually unrestricted access to federal student aid has been a key driver of college costs. David Lucca, Taylor Nadauld, and Karen Shen of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that credit expansion (increasing subsidized federal student loans) leads to a tuition increase of 60 cents for every additional dollar of subsidized federal loans.REF To bring down college costs and reduce student debt, Congress should eliminate the PLUS Loan program.  Require Colleges to Have Financial “Skin in the Game” for Student Loans. As a condition of participating in the federal student loan and grant programs (Title IV of the Higher Education Act), Congress should require colleges to pay for a portion of the defaulted student loans of their borrowers. As the Texas Public Policy Foundation’s Andrew Gillen explains, that essentially means “asking colleges to be co-signers for their students’ loans.”REF Colleges and universities should also be allowed to cap student borrowing.  Reform Accreditation to Provide More Post-Secondary Options for Americans. The Higher Education Reform and Opportunity (HERO) Act would decouple federal higher education financing (student loans and grants) from the federal accreditation process. States would be free to establish their own systems for determining who can accredit or credential individual courses, programs of study, or institutions. Federal student aid would then be available to follow students to institutions and individual courses that are credentialed under a state’s accreditation system, enabling a student to have a more customized higher education experience, more quickly enter the labor market, and reduce debt burdens.  Enable Lower-Cost Education Alternatives. The Apprenticeship Freedom ActREF and Training America’s Workforce ActREF would help to level the playing field so that apprenticeship programs could develop across more industries and provide more workers with the option of on-the-job, paid training and education ending in a successful career.  Conclusion  Pursuing new, commonsense approaches to education reform and work-family policies, from early education and care through higher education and workforce flexibility, will encourage the conditions for family flourishing and increase the married birth rate. Affordable childcare available through a variety of providers, including at-home options, access to high-quality K–12 education that families choose that reflects their values, a higher education landscape that provides numerous routes—beyond that of a standard bachelor’s degree—to climbing the ladder of upward mobility, and flexible work arrangements will give families confidence that they can have the number of children they desire. Public policy should support families as they form and grow and can do so through reducing government regulatory overreach, by directly funding students instead of institutions, and by removing barriers to a flexible workforce.

In an interview with the Los Angeles Times published Monday, the “Vanderpump Rules” star alleged that the film producer made the comment after she was administered an IV and passed out before giving birth.  She further alleged Emmett, 52, felt “so uncomfortable” that he opted to leave the delivery room, organizing for Kent’s mother, Lisa Burningham, to fly from Utah to Los Angeles to stand in for him.  The movie producer allegedly rented a hospital suite and had his assistant deliver Fireball, NyQuil and bedding, per the LA Times.  Per the outlet, on March 15, 2021, at 6:45 a.m., Emmett reportedly returned to the delivery room as Kent, 32, was ready to give birth.  In an interview with the LA Times, Kent and her mother alleged that Emmett was not present overnight while the “Vanderpump Rules” stat was in labor. Instaram/lalakent  Speaking to the outlet, Burningham claimed that Emmett arrived for the birth of Ocean but left the hospital “by 8 a.m.” He allegedly did not return until Kent was discharged on March 16, 2021.  Emmett denied these claims, telling Page Six and the LA Times, “The birth of Ocean was one of the most wonderful moments of my life and I was present for every second of it.”  However, he also claimed to Page Six exclusively, that he “flew Lala’s mother out so she could share the moment with us and be a part of the birth of her granddaughter.”  In a May 2021 episode of Kent’s podcast “Give them Lala,” the new parents spoke about the day, portraying a different tone of their experience.  However, Emmett claimed to Page Six that he was present for “every second” of their daughter Ocean’s birth. Roy Rochlin/Getty Images for Convergence Entertainment Group  As Kent began telling the story of how she passed out when the nurse tried to stick her with the IV, Emmett took over saying, “Lala really doesn’t have any place to tell this part. I want her to share every beautiful moment of being the mother and giving birth to our daughter [but] this one I’m going to tell.”  After detailing that Kent actually passed out multiple times, he joked, “I’m thinking, ‘OK, if she’s passing out, she’s in the bed. She’s not going anywhere.’ But there’s a difference between an exorcism and passing out.  “Because you see your best friend and your partner, eyes going back into their head, it’s horrifying. I’ve never seen anything like this and I’ve been with her five years.”  For more Page Six you love …  Kent spoke to the LA Times after the Hulu documentary — based on the outlet’s 2022 investigation of Emmett’s lawsuits and mounting debt — “The Randall Scandal: Love, Loathing and Vanderpump” was released on Monday.  Emmett slammed the doc ahead of its release, telling Page Six that he refused to participate because it was “just as biased” as the “highly biased and factually inaccurate hit piece” that the film was based on.  The former couple has been embroiled in a custody battle following their 2021 split. randallemmettfilms/Instagram  Kent and Emmett met in 2015 while he was still married to Ambyr Childers — who he shares daughters Rylee and London with.  The two are rumored to have been dating during the time that Emmett and Childers finalized their divorce in 2017, but they didn’t go public with their relationship until January 2018. Kent and Emmett then announced their engagement in September of that same year.  They then welcomed daughter Ocean in March 2021. However, they split in October after he allegedly cheated on her.

"birth","2019-11-01","Not Discerned","{""Qom"", ""Qom"", ""Iran""}","2023-05-22T19:10:00","Iran is facing declining birth rates. This has been an increasing issue in the last several years and one which the Iranian regime is keenly focused on.  A new report at Iran’s pro-regime Fars News says that the country is facing the prospect of large numbers of families who will only have one child, and the regime wants to warn the people about this population “black hole” that may lead to further demographic decline.  Last year, the Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei also warned officials against an aging population and demographic decline. At the time the statistics in Iran said that the fertility rate was 1.71 children per woman. This is considered below the replacement rate, meaning that for every two people today, there will be fewer in the future. It also means many families are choosing to have one child or perhaps no children.  In many Western societies and also in places like China, South Korea and Japan, this trend is already clear. However, for the Iranian regime, which is a theocratic regime, the issue of increasing the number of children is important.  The declining demographics could be seen as a vote by the people against the regime since they don’t care about the religious pro-natal policies and don’t want large families that would please the regime’s view of how the world should be ordered.  Members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) attend an IRGC ground forces military drill in the Aras area, East Azerbaijan province, Iran, October 17, 2022. (credit: IRGC/WANA/HANDOUT VIA REUTERS)  The report in Iran’s media was candid in its views. It said that Iran now faces a future of children who have no siblings and the article argues that this leads to demographic decline and also harms society.  Why does Iran need a higher birth rate?  Historically in the 20th century, the issue of the “battle of the births” was a key element of Mussolini’s fascist agenda in Italy because it was believed that more children leads to a younger society that can produce more young men for national expansion. For Iran’s regime, this certainly is an issue, because it frequently boasts about its influence in the Middle East and how it is confronting the US and Israel. But if the country has internal problems, such as protests and an aging population, it won’t be able to fulfill the regime’s desire for controlling the Middle East.  The article at Fars News says that the aging crisis in Iran leads to many types of harm across society “because the development and progress of any society requires young manpower.” No young manpower, no more fast boats, missiles, and drones, for instance. The article argues that “three-person families,” by which they mean two parents and one child, will splinter society and lead to a spiral of decline.  “When we look a little more closely at families of three; we realize the bitter and unfortunate truths. Facts like children who will be deprived of having uncles, aunts.” This is because a single child has no brothers and sisters so their children won’t have “aunts and uncles,” in this view of demographic futures. “According to population experts, if the birth process in the country continues in the same way…in the not so distant years, we will enter a population black hole that may be impossible to get out of.”  Therefore, Iran is pushing a multi-year plan to increase the number of births. Considering the fact that most societies that attempted plans like this have failed, Iran has little chance of success under the current regime. If a religious theocracy can’t get people to have kids already despite endless propaganda, it’s unclear how any society would succeed in its stead, without improving the quality of life or prospects of the people.  Iran believes that families who have one child will increase numerous problems in society, including “failure, rejection… they do not experience the conditions that require mental and emotional maturity. Many times, because the real world is not completely in accordance with the wishes and desires of these children and does not meet their expectations, they suffer from frustration and incompatibility.”  Iran’s regime believes the current trend will lead to isolation among these families, bad “attitude and behavior” and bad decision, “tendency to isolation, depression, weakness in communicating with peers, paying too much attention to computer and solitary games, fear or hatred of being in social groups are among the characteristics of being an only child.”  The article says that having siblings can increase social spirit and help people manage relationships. While ostensibly the regime is arguing that children with siblings will have more “compassion” and ease in communicating and social situations; the overall message links more to the regime’s future challenges.  The regime’s entire investment in this issue is related to its desire to have more young men for the Basij militias and the IRGC, so it can continue its influence in the region and expand its power.  Iran invests heavily in long-term goals based mostly on its ability to employ people throughout the region. What that means is that Iran needs more Qasem Soleimanis, the famed IRGC commander. It appears the regime knows that the generation of men such as Soleimani and IRGC Aerospace commander Amir Ali Hajizadeh are fading from the scene, either because they were hit by missiles like Soleimani or because they simply get older.  Iran may not have a new generation of the kind of men that led it in the 1980s-2000s. The birthrate issue is only one part of the larger battle and the regime is being very candid about its challenges.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpwb3N0LmNvbS9taWRkbGUtZWFzdC9pcmFuLW5ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS03NDM5MDTSATxodHRwczovL20uanBvc3QuY29tL21pZGRsZS1lYXN0L2lyYW4tbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlLTc0MzkwNC9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The F.D.A. will decide this summer whether to follow this recommendation‌; if it does, the United States will join over 100 other countries that have approved oral contraceptives for use without a prescription. ‌  This development, which health experts widely agree could greatly affect public health for a nation in which nearly half of pregnancies are unintended, comes three decades later than many people once expected.  At a 1992 conference on birth control, an official on the F.D.A.’s fertility and maternal health drugs advisory committee, Philip Corfman, noted that the birth control pill is safer than aspirin, which is available over the counter. The F.D.A. subsequently announced plans to convene a hearing to consider moving oral contraceptives to over-the-counter. It was believed that this would greatly expand access to birth control by bypassing doctors, to whom millions of Americans then — as now — had little access. But as the historian Heather Munro Prescott has recounted, the hearing was canceled at least partly because of criticism from what might seem a surprising cohort: the nation’s leading feminist patient advocacy organizations.  Dr. Prescott reported that the program director of the National Women’s Health Network at the time, Cindy Pearson, said that a “birth control prescription is the poor woman’s ticket to health care.” Advocates for women’s health were concerned that if birth control was made available over the counter, then insurance might stop paying for it and impose new financial barriers to access.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMjIvb3Bpbmlvbi9iaXJ0aC1jb250cm9sLW92ZXItdGhlLWNvdW50ZXItZmRhLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"birth","2021-06-21","Not Discerned","{""Austin"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T18:28:41","After multiple miscarriages, Kiersten Hogan thought she would never be able to carry a pregnancy to term. She’d nearly given up hope when in June 2021 she learned she was pregnant. But at just 19 weeks — days after Texas’ Senate Bill 8 went into effect — Hogan woke up at 5 a.m. in excruciating pain. She called 911 and was instructed to unlock her front door and lay on the ground until EMTs arrived. “It was the longest 5 minutes of my life,” Hogan recalled on Monday.  Her water had broken. By the time she arrived at the hospital, she had lost too much amniotic fluid for her son to survive — but hospital staff didn’t tell her that. “They didn’t tell me much about my son’s chances of survival. But the one thing they did make clear repeatedly was that I should not leave,” a tearful Hogan said Monday. “I was told that if I tried to discharge myself, or seek care elsewhere, that I could be arrested for trying to kill my child. So of course, I stayed.”  Hogan recounted a harrowing five days inside the hospital, where she says religious counselors repeatedly came to visit her, even though she had declined pastoral care. She recalled being terrified of even going to the bathroom — afraid she would go into premature labor, and be arrested.  “On the fifth day in the hospital, while using the bathroom, my son started to enter the birth canal,” Hogan said. “I was rushed to labor and delivery where I gave birth to him stillborn.”  The next morning she was discharged, and told she could return to work the next day, “as if nothing had happened,” Hogan said.  Hogan is one of eight new plaintiffs who joined a lawsuit against the state of Texas on Monday, seeking clarification about what qualifies as a medical emergency under Texas’ medieval abortion bans. Also on Monday, lawyers for the Center for Reproductive Rights, which filed the initial suit in March, asked a district court in Travis County for a temporary injunction blocking Texas’ abortion bans in cases of pregnancy complications as the case continues. Editor’s picks  The original suit was filed on behalf of five women who were denied abortion care and two obstetrician-gynecologists who work in the state. It challenges the state’s three, overlapping bans: a criminal ban that pre-dates Roe v. Wade, a trigger ban — now in effect — passed in anticipation of Roe being overturned, and S.B. 8, an de facto ban on abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy. All three bans ostensibly include exceptions for medical “emergencies,” but the laws’ vague language has contributed to widespread confusion over what qualifies — and stiff penalties that have made medical providers fearful of offering treatment that could put them in legal jeopardy. Doctors who are found guilty of providing an abortion in violation of the bans can face up to 99 years in prison, a minimum of $100,000 in fines, and the loss of their medical license.  Among the eight women who joined the lawsuit on Monday, some, like Hogan, were forced to give birth against their will to children who survived for vanishingly short periods of time.  Kylie Beaton learned her child had alobar holoprosencephaly, a condition that causes the head to grow at an abnormal speed. By the time she received the diagnosis at 20 weeks, her baby’s head was the size of a 24-week-old. She was past the cut-off for an abortion in neighboring New Mexico. By the time she was 28 weeks pregnant, her baby’s head was the size of a 39-week old fetus. She asked to be induced, but providers refused, citing the state’s abortion ban. At 35 weeks, Beaton was finally granted a cesarean section. Her son survived for four days.  Samantha Casiano learned her baby had anencephaly — a condition in which a fetus develops missing pieces of her brain and skull — at her 20-week scan. It is a fatal diagnosis. Casiano says she was told she would have to go through with the pregnancy, prescribed an antidepressant and sent home. She spent the remainder of her pregnancy accepting well-wishes from strangers, while planning a funeral for her daughter. Her daughter lived for four hours after birth.

Weller says she was first prescribed antibiotics to prevent infection, then told she could not obtain an abortion because as long as she was on antibiotics she would be too healthy to necessitate the procedure. Her infection ultimately worsened, spreading to the placenta and the amniotic fluid, and the hospital finally induced labor. Her daughter did not survive the birth.  “It breaks my heart that the state that I love is denying me and my neighbors lifesaving healthcare, prolonging our grief and mourning — and for what? Families like mine deserve better,” Weller said on Monday, “Life is fragile enough.

Patty Murray of Washington thinks this should be it.  ""Women in many states today, because of the decision by the Supreme Court, are really worried about their access to be able to have birth control pills as a way of making sure they don't become pregnant, because in their states, they won't have access to abortion care,"" Murray, a Democrat, said in an interview with NPR.  ""I disagree wholeheartedly with the Supreme Court decision,"" she said, referring to last summer's Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization ruling that overturned decades of abortion-rights precedent. ""But at the same time, we need to make sure that over-the-counter birth control is available.""  Murray re-introduced legislation on Thursday that would require insurance companies to cover over-the-counter birth control pills as soon as they become available without a prescription, as recently recommended unanimously by a Food and Drug Administration panel. More than 100 countries already allow oral contraceptives to be dispensed this way.  Murray's bill would build on a requirement in the Affordable Care Act that most health insurance companies provide contraceptive coverage without a co-pay.  ""Now that we are seeing that it may become available over the counter, we want to make sure that insurers still pay for it because it is costly,"" Murray says. ""This is a great step if FDA approves this and women can go to the drugstore and purchase it without having to have a doctor's appointment ... but it will only be available for some women if it is not covered by insurance.""  A push for Republican support  In the wake of the Dobbs decision, Murray says she hopes Republicans will join her — which would be essential in a closely-divided Congress for her legislation to advance.  Murray notes that some Republicans who oppose abortion rights have said they do not intend to limit access to birth control. Leaders of the Congressional Pro-Life Caucus, among others, have made such claims.  ""I say to them, this is your opportunity to show people that you are living the words that you're speaking and co-sign the legislation,"" Murray says. ""Work with us. Let's get this passed.""  So far, she has no Republican co-sponsors. But some Congressional Republicans have a history of supporting legislation meant to ease access to contraceptives. Last year, just weeks after the Dobbs decision, a group of Iowa Republicans including Senators Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley and Congresswomen Mariannette Miller-Meeks and Ashley Hinson proposed legislation designed to expedite efforts to make certain contraceptives available over the counter to patients 18 and older.  Groups opposed to abortion rights have generally avoided taking positions explicitly opposing contraception, although some support legislation that reproductive rights advocates warn could threaten access to some birth control methods.  In a statement, Students for Life of America described the move toward over-the-counter birth control as ""reckless"" and suggested that easier distribution of birth control pills is unwise given rising rates of some types of sexually transmitted infections, which the organization described as an ""epidemic of sexually transmitted disease.""  A separate fight - over abortion pills  Murray's bill focuses on improving access to birth control pills, which prevent pregnancy. But the proposal comes amidst other battles over access to reproductive health care, including ongoing litigation in the federal courts over the abortion pill, mifepristone. That drug is widely used in combination with another medication to terminate mostly first-trimester pregnancies, and to treat patients experiencing miscarriages.  A lawsuit filed by a coalition of anti-abortion rights groups challenges the FDA's approval of the pill in 2000 and several subsequent rule changes that have eased access to the drug, including allowing the pills to be distributed by mail. It seeks to remove mifepristone from the market altogether.  In the latest development in that case, a federal appeals court heard arguments last week during a hearing in New Orleans.  As NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin reported, a panel of conservative-leaning federal judges posed questions to lawyers on both sides. Judge Cory Wilson asked Deputy Assistant Attorney General Sarah Harrington, who was representing the FDA, what happens to patients who receive pills in the mail, if the drugs do not successfully terminate a pregnancy within two weeks. Harrington told Wilson that in a small percentage of cases, patients may need to contact their healthcare providers for follow-up care.  Abortion rights advocates say medication abortion is a preferred option for many patients for a variety of reasons, including for people who live in rural areas without access to abortion clinics, those who want to avoid a surgical procedure to terminate an unwanted pregnancy or help ease a miscarriage already underway, or who prefer to complete the process at home.  In an interview with NPR's Becky Sullivan, a woman named Rebecca, who asked that we use only her first name, said that having the option to terminate her pregnancy at home in 2020 during the pandemic was a ""godsend,"" particularly given the fact that she believed some of her family members would not have supported her decision.  ""Being able to do it in the privacy of my home and not having to explain anything to anyone is the biggest part of it,"" she said.

Rushed into the operating room for an emergency cesarean section, months before her due date, she nearly died of an undiagnosed case of sepsis. Even more disheartening: Angelica worked at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, the university affiliated with the hospital that treated her. Her experience is a reflection of the medical racism, bias and inattentive care that Black Americans endure. Black women have the highest maternal mortality rate in the United States — 69.9 per 100,000 live births for 2021, almost three times the rate for white women, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Black babies are more likely to die, and also far more likely to be born prematurely, setting the stage for health issues that could follow them through their lives.  false  “Race plays a huge part, especially in the South, in terms of how you’re treated,” Angelica said, and the effects are catastrophic. “People are dying.”  Angelica Lyons tears up while recalling her birthing experience during an interview in Birmingham, Ala., on Feb. 5, 2022.  To be Black anywhere in America is to experience higher rates of chronic ailments like asthma, diabetes, high blood pressure, Alzheimer's and, most recently, COVID-19. Black Americans have less access to adequate medical care; their life expectancy is shorter. From birth to death, regardless of wealth or social standing, they are far more likely to get sick and die from common ailments. Black Americans’ health issues have long been ascribed to genetics or behavior, when in actuality, an array of circumstances linked to racism — among them, restrictions on where people could live and historical lack of access to care — play major roles. Discrimination and bias in hospital settings have been disastrous. The nation’s health disparities have had a tragic impact: Over the past two decades, the higher mortality rate among Black Americans resulted in 1.6 million excess deaths compared to white Americans. That higher mortality rate resulted in a cumulative loss of more than 80 million years of life due to people dying young and billions of dollars in health care and lost opportunity. A yearlong Associated Press project found that the health challenges Black Americans endure often begin before their first breath. The AP conducted dozens of interviews with doctors, medical professionals, advocates, historians and researchers who detailed how a history of racism that began during the foundational years of America led to the disparities seen today.  Angelica Lyons carries her son while her younger sister, Ansonia Lyons, finishes her snack in the background.  Angelica Lyons’ pregnancy troubles began during her first trimester, with nausea and severe acid reflux. She was prescribed medication that helped alleviate her symptoms but it also caused severe constipation. In the last week of October 2019, while she was giving her students a test, her stomach started to hurt badly. “I remember talking to a couple of my students and they said, ‘You don’t look good, Ms. Lyons,'"" Angelica recalled. She called the University of Alabama-Birmingham Hospital’s labor and delivery unit to tell them she was having a hard time using the bathroom and her stomach was hurting. A woman who answered the phone told her it was a common pregnancy issue, Angelica said, and that she shouldn’t worry too much. “She made me feel like my concern wasn’t important, and because this was my first pregnancy, I decided not to go because I wasn’t sure and thought maybe I was overreacting,” Angelica said. The pain persisted. She went to the hospital a few days later and was admitted. She had an enema — a procedure where fluids are used to cleanse or stimulate the emptying of bowels — to alleviate her constipation, but Angelica continued to plead with them that she was in pain. “They were like, ‘Oh, it’s nothing, it’s just the Braxton Hicks contractions,'"" she said. “They just ignored me.” She was sent home but her stomach continued to ache, so she went back to the hospital a day later. Several tests, including MRIs, couldn’t find the source of the issue. Angelica was eventually moved to the labor and delivery floor of the hospital so they could monitor her son’s heartbeat, which had dropped slightly. There, they performed another enema that finally helped with the pain. She also was diagnosed with preeclampsia, a dangerous condition that can cause severe pregnancy complications or death. Then she began to vomit what appeared to be bile. “I got worse and worse with the pain and I kept telling them, ‘Hey, I’m in pain,’” Angelica said. “They’d say, ‘Oh, you want some Tylenol?’ But it wasn’t helping.” She struggled to eat dinner that night. When she stood up to go to the bathroom, she felt a sharp pain ricochet throughout her body. “I started hollering because I had no idea what was going on,"" she said. ""I told my sister I was in so much pain and to please call the nurse.” What happened next remains a blur. Angelica recalls the chaos of hospital staff rushing her to labor and delivery, putting up a blue sheet to prepare her for an emergency C-section as her family and ex-husband tried to understand what went wrong. She later learned that she nearly died. “I was on life support,” recalled Angelica, 34. “I coded.” She woke up three days later, unable to talk because of a ventilator in her mouth. She remembers gesturing wildly to her mother, asking where her son, Malik, was. He was OK. But Angelica felt so much had been taken from her. She never got to experience those first moments of joy of having her newborn placed on her chest. She didn’t even know what her son looked like.  Maternal sepsis is a leading cause of maternal mortality in America. Black women are twice as likely to develop severe maternal sepsis, as compared to their white counterparts. Common symptoms can include fever or pain in the area of infection. Sepsis can develop quickly, so a timely response is crucial. Sepsis in its early stages can mirror common pregnancy symptoms, so it can be hard to diagnose. Due to a lack of training, some medical providers don’t know what to look for. But slow or missed diagnoses are also the result of bias, structural racism in medicine and inattentive care that leads to patients, particularly Black women, not being heard. “The way structural racism can play out in this particular disease is not being taken seriously,” said Dr. Laura Riley, chief of obstetrics and gynecology at Weill Cornell Medicine and New York-Presbyterian Hospital. “We know that delay in diagnosis is what leads to these really bad outcomes.” In the days and weeks that followed, Angelica demanded explanations from the medical staff of what happened. But she felt the answers she received on how it occurred were sparse and confusing. A spokesperson for the University of Alabama at Birmingham said in a statement to The Associated Press that they couldn’t talk about Angelica’s case because of patient privacy laws. They pointed to a recent internal survey done by its Obstetrics and Gynecology department that showed that most of its patients are satisfied with their care and “are largely feeling respected,” and said the university and hospital “maintain intentional, proactive efforts in addressing health disparities and maternal mortality.” Angelica’s son, Malik, was born eight weeks early, weighing under 5 pounds. He spent a month in intensive care. He received home visits through the first year of life to monitor his growth. While he’s now a curious and vivacious 3-year-old who loves to explore the world around him, Angelica recalls those days in the ICU, and she feels guilty because she could not be with him. “It’s scary to know I could have died, that we could have died,” Lyons said, wiping away tears.

For decades, frustrated birth advocates and medical professionals have tried to sound an alarm about the ways medicine has failed Black women. Historians trace that maltreatment to racist medical practices that Black people endured amid and after slavery. To fully understand maternal mortality and infant mortality crises for Black women and babies, the nation must first reckon with the dark history of how gynecology began, said Deirdre Cooper Owens, a historian and author. “The history of this particular medical branch … it begins on a slave farm in Alabama,” Owens said. “The advancement of obstetrics and gynecology had such an intimate relationship with slavery, and was literally built on the wounds of Black women.” Reproductive surgeries that were experimental at the time, like cesarean sections, were commonly performed on enslaved Black women. Physicians like the once-heralded J. Marion Sims, an Alabama doctor many call the “father of gynecology,” performed torturous surgical experiments on enslaved Black women in the 1840s without anesthesia. And well after the abolition of slavery, hospitals performed unnecessary hysterectomies on Black women, and eugenics programs sterilized them. Health care segregation also played a major role in the racial health gap still experienced today. Until Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Black families were mostly barred from well-funded white hospitals and often received limited, poor or inhumane medical treatment. Black-led clinics and doctors worked hard to fill in the gaps, but even after the new protections, hospitals once reserved for Black families remained under-resourced, and Black women didn’t get the same support regularly available for white women. That history of abuse and neglect led to deep-rooted distrust of health care institutions among communities of color. “We have to recognize that it’s not about just some racist people or a few bad actors,” said Rana A. Hogarth, an associate professor of History at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. “People need to stop thinking about things like slavery and racism as just these features that happened that are part of the contours of history and maybe think of them more as foundational and institutions that have been with us every step of the way.” Some health care providers still hold false beliefs about biological differences between Black and white people, such as Black people having “less sensitive nerve endings, thicker skin, and stronger bones.” Those beliefs have caused medical providers today to rate Black patients’ pain lower, and recommend less relief. The differences exist regardless of education or income level. Black women who have a college education or higher have a pregnancy-related mortality rate that is more than five times higher than that of white women. Notably, the pregnancy-related mortality rate for Black women with a college education is 1.6. times higher than that of white women with less than a high school degree.  Ansonia Lyons bottle feeds her son, Adrien Lyons, in the television room of her parents' home.  In Angelica Lyons’ home state of Alabama, about 40 mothers die within one year after delivery. The toll on Black mothers is disproportionate. The state's infant mortality rate for 2021 was 7.6 deaths per 1,000 live births. The disparities between Black and white babies is stark: The infant mortality rate in 2021 for white mothers was 5.8, while the infant mortality rate for Black mothers was 12.1, an increase from 10.9 from the prior year. Black babies account for just 29% of births in Alabama, yet nearly 47% of infant deaths.  false  A 2020 report by the Alabama Maternal Mortality Review Committee found that more than 55% of 80 pregnancy-related deaths that they reviewed in 2016 and 2017 could have been prevented. Alabama launched its Maternal Mortality Review Committee in 2018 to investigate maternal deaths. But Dr. Scott Harris, Alabama’s Department of Public Health State Health Officer, said work remains to collect a fuller picture of why the disparities exist. “We certainly know that from national numbers as well that Black women have worse maternal outcomes at every income level, which is pretty startling,” said Dr. Harris. “Age matters and just overall ZIP code matters. Unfortunately, where people live, where these children are born, is strongly associated with infant mortality. I think we’ll see something similar for maternal outcomes.” And concerns about access and barriers to care remain. In Alabama, 37% of counties are maternity care deserts — more than 240,000 women live in counties with no or little care. About 39% of counties don’t have a single obstetric provider. Alabama is not alone in this. More than 2.2 million American women of childbearing age live in maternity care deserts, and another 4.8 million such women reside in counties with limited access to maternity care.  false  Angelica Lyons said she wanted to seek maternal care at another hospital but the University of Alabama was the only one near her home equipped to handle her high-risk pregnancy, which included high blood pressure near the beginning. Dr. Harris acknowledged the lack of access to care is a barrier for Black women who live in the state’s rural areas. Much of the state’s public health efforts are targeted along the rural Black Belt, which gets its name from the rich soil but it was also a region where many plantations were clustered. Centuries later, the Black Belt continues to be a high-poverty region with a large Black population. More than half of the nation’s Black population lives in the South. “We’ve talked a lot about structural racism and the impact of that on African American women and how it has no place in society,” Harris said. “I think we have to publicly call it what it is.”  Angelica Lyons’ traumatic birth experience was not the only one in her family. After two miscarriages, her younger sister, Ansonia, became pregnant in 2020, and it was difficult. Angelica Lyons and Ansonia Lyons pose for portraits.  Doctors told her she was suffering from regular morning sickness, though she was vomiting blood. She was eventually diagnosed with an excessive vomiting disorder, hyperemesis gravidarum, and was extremely dehydrated. Ansonia spent months in and out of the same hospital where her sister had been treated. “They said, ‘Welcome to the pregnancy, sweetheart. This is what pregnancy is,’” Ansonia, 30, recalled. “I told her, ‘No, this is not normal for me to be throwing up 10 to 20 times a day.’ My own primary care wasn’t listening to me.” Ansonia said throughout her pregnancy she encountered hospital staff that made stereotypical jokes, calling her child’s father her “baby daddy,” a trope often lobbed at Black parents. “She said, ‘So, your baby daddy, where does he work?’” Ansonia recalled. “I said, ‘I don’t know what a baby daddy is but the father of my child is at work.’ She asked where he worked and I told her he had two businesses and she acted like she was surprised.” Ansonia said staff assumed she didn’t have any health insurance, when she had insurance through her employer. Ansonia has Type 2 diabetes and had issues with her blood pressure and heart throughout the pregnancy. She started to see a cardiologist and by the time she was 21 weeks pregnant, she was diagnosed with congestive heart failure. She was placed on a medley of medications, and her doctors decided to deliver the baby early via C-section. Ansonia was scared, given everything she witnessed her sister go through nearly two years prior. “There were several times I told my boyfriend that I thought that I was going to die,” she said.  The C-section went well. Ansonia’s son, Adrien, was due in July 2021 but he was born at the end of May. He spent his first five days in the intensive care unit, then was hospitalized for some early breathing problems. Ansonia Lyons spends time with her son, Adrien Lyons.  Cesarean delivery rates are higher for Black women than white women, 36.8% and 31%, respectively, in 2021.  false  Problems continued for Ansonia after the delivery. She ended up needing a blood transfusion and was unable to see her son for his first few days of life. A few months postpartum, she was still vomiting and having fainting spells that led to her being admitted to the hospital off and on. Her arms suffered from bruising from needles used to treat her throughout the pregnancy. She had always been slow to heal from any bruising, a common problem for diabetics. Yet a doctor who had been involved throughout her entire pregnancy questioned why she had bruises on her arms and asked if she “smoked weed” or took any other recreational drugs. The hospital declined to comment, citing patient privacy laws. “I said, ‘This is from me being stuck so many times and having to be in the hospital.’ I told him I don’t do any drugs,” she said. He still sent her blood work off to be tested. The tests came back negative. “That just made me not trust them, it made me not want to go back,” she said.  Ansonia Lyons walks down the corridor of her parents' home with her son, Adrien Lyons.  There are indications that the sufferings of Black mothers and their babies are being recognized, however late. In 2019, U.S. Rep. Lauren Underwood, an Illinois Democrat, and Rep. Alma Adams, a North Carolina Democrat, launched the Black Maternal Health Caucus. It is now one of the largest bipartisan congressional caucuses. The caucus introduced the Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act in 2019 and again in 2021, proposing sweeping changes that would increase funding and strengthen oversight. Key parts of the legislation have been adopted but the bill itself has yet to be approved. Biden’s budget for fiscal year 2024 includes $471 million in funding to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity rates, expand maternal health initiatives in rural communities, and implicit bias training and other initiatives. It also requires states to provide continuous Medicaid coverage for 12 months postpartum, to eliminate gaps in health insurance. It also includes $1.9 billion in funding for women and child health programs. U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra told The Associated Press more must be done at all levels of government to root out racism and bias within health care. “We know that if we provide access to care for mother and baby for a full year, that we probably help produce not just good health results, but a promising future for mom and baby moving forward,” he said.  Ansonia Lyons looks at a photograph of her younger self, right in photo, posing with her sister Angelica Lyons, left in photo.  Shelonda Lyons always taught both her daughters the bitter truth of racism, hoping it would prepare them to navigate life growing up in Birmingham, the Deep South city known for its place in civil rights history. “When we were young, she was showing us those images of all the Black people being hung, being burned on the trees,” Angelica said, pointing to a book that remains on the family’s coffee table. “She wanted us to understand it, to know where we lived and that racism was something that we might have to deal with.” But Shelonda never could have prepared for the treatment her daughters endured during their pregnancies. She remembers feeling helpless and angry. “It’s like a slap in the face to me because at what point do you realize that you’re dealing with human beings? That it doesn’t matter what color they are,” she said, adding that now she worries any time they or her grandsons need to go to the doctor. “I don’t have a lot of trust.” Angelica underwent two surgeries in the weeks that followed her C-section to repair internal damage and address her infection. She had to wear a colostomy bag for several months until she healed. More than three years later, her stomach remains disfigured. “I love my child, I love him all the same but this isn’t the body I was born with,"" she said. “This is the body that they caused from them not paying attention to me, not listening to me.”  First: Angelica Lyons secures her son, Malik Lyons-Law, into his child car seat while her sister, Ansonia Lyons, prepares to ride with her after their breakfast outing to celebrate their father's birthday.

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:  Credit: Unsplash/CC0 Public Domain  People giving birth report more positive experiences when cared for by midwives in both hospitals and in community settings than by physicians, according to a new study published in the journal Reproductive Health. Additionally, those receiving midwifery care at home or at birth centers reported better experiences than those in hospital settings.  The majority of U.S. births (88%) are attended by physicians, while midwives attend 12% of births. Most births occur in the hospital, with less than 2% of all births occurring in community settings, including homes and freestanding birth centers. Most community births are attended by midwives.  Measures of quality around maternity care often focus on clinical markers such as complications or rates of C-sections, leaving the lived experience of childbearing people unmeasured and neglected.  ""In contrast to the standard obstetrical model, midwifery care is rooted in a philosophy that honors pregnancy and birth as a physiological, social and cultural process, not solely a clinical event,"" write the authors, including lead author Mimi Niles, Ph.D., MPH, CNM, assistant professor at NYU Rory Meyers College of Nursing. ""The care relationship between the client and the midwife serves as the primary vehicle through which values such as autonomy, respect, and informed decision-making are operationalized to preserve an overall satisfying experience of childbearing.""  To better understand people's experiences during childbirth, the researchers examined 1,771 responses to the national Giving Voice to Mothers survey assessing four domains of the childbirth experience: communication and decision-making autonomy, respect, mistreatment, and time spent during visits. The researchers then analyzed differences between provider type and birth settings, breaking responses down into those cared for by a midwife at a community birth, a midwife at a hospital birth, and a physician at hospital birth.  Compared to those cared for by physicians in hospitals, individuals cared for by midwives in community settings had more than five times the odds of experiencing higher autonomy and were five times more likely to report that their provider showed them high levels of respect. They also reported lower odds of mistreatment.  The researchers also found significant differences across birth settings: patients cared for by midwives at home or birth centers had significantly better experiences than those in the hospital settings across all four measures—autonomy, respect, mistreatment, and time spent. For instance, people cared for by midwives in the community were 14 times more likely to report having enough time in prenatal visits than those cared for by physicians, while people receiving midwifery care in hospital settings were nearly twice as likely to report having enough time during prenatal visits. Their findings generate more evidence that while the midwifery care model offers enhanced experiences of care, access to midwifery across all settings is needed to improve health outcomes for birthing people.  ""Our findings add to evidence showing the model itself seems to be strongly influenced by the setting in which care is given—with community settings (home and free- standing birth centers) offering greater likelihood of support and the hospital settings being limited by the constraints of a medical approach to care which deprioritizes experiential outcomes,"" Niles and her co-authors write.

"birth","1890-05-01","Not Discerned","{""Concord"", ""NewHampshire"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T10:30:00","Although she’s been dead for almost six decades, it looks like Elizabeth Gurley Flynn is still getting under the skin of right-wingers. Just two weeks after it was installed, a historical marker commemorating her birth in Concord, N.H., has been demolished on the order of Republican state officials.  The green and white cast iron plaque—the kind you see on the side of highways or in public places noting where significant events occurred or famous persons once lived—was erected on May Day in downtown Concord, where Flynn was born in 1890.  The sign was barely bolted into place before conservatives demanded its removal, embarrassed apparently that the state might recognize someone who devoted her life to fighting for workers’ rights, women’s right to vote, birth control, civil liberties, and economic equality. But it was Flynn’s leadership in the Communist Party USA that really boiled their blood.  “This is a devout communist,” complained Joseph Kenney, a Republican member of the Executive Council, the five-person body that approves state contracts, judicial nominees, and other positions.  How can we possibly promote her propaganda, which still exists now through this sign in downtown Concord?  But in a state with the motto “Live Free or Die,” is there really any better figure to represent that rebellious spirit than “The Rebel Girl” herself?  An agitator her entire life  Flynn earned her Rebel Girl nickname doing battle against the same kind of reactionary politics expressed by Kenney. She made her debut as an activist at the age of 15, giving her first public speech, “What Socialism Will Do for Women,” at the Harlem Socialist Club in New York.  Two years later, at just 17, she was already a full-time organizer for the Wobblies, the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), a revolutionary labor group that sought to organize all workers into “One Big Union.” She traveled from one end of the country to the other, organizing restaurant workers in New York, garment workers in Pennsylvania, weavers in New Jersey, miners in Minnesota, Montana, and Washington State.  She was immortalized in song for her exploits by famed songwriter Joe Hill, who penned “The Rebel Girl” in 1915, giving Flynn the moniker that would follow her for the rest of her life.  With bosses and their hired guns in local police departments determined to muzzle anyone demanding rights for workers, the IWW faced many free speech fights. City councils were pressured by employers to ban organizers from speaking in the streets.  During one such battle in Spokane, Wash., Flynn chained herself to a lamppost so the cops wouldn’t be able to drag her off to jail as easily. There, she gave a fiery speech demanding freedom for workers to organize and publish their views. She’d end up behind bars more than ten times during her years with the IWW.  With the first Red Scare in full swing following the Russian Revolution, constitutional freedoms like speech, press, and assembly were under attack across the United States. Workers and their organizations were the primary targets, and foreign-born immigrant workers faced mass deportations. This prompted Flynn and others to found the American Civil Liberties Union to defend democracy against right-wing reactionaries.  She also pushed the ACLU to take an active role in fighting for women’s rights, particularly access to birth control and the right to vote.  When Italian anarchists Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti were framed up on murder charges in 1920, Flynn became a leader in their defense campaign and helped turn their case into an international cause célèbre.  Though the two were eventually murdered by the state, the effort to save them helped launch the International Labor Defense, which fought to save the Scottsboro Nine, battled Ku Klux Klan terror, and defended workers in courtrooms anytime they were under attack. Flynn served as the organization’s chair for a number of years.  By the mid-’30s, amidst the suffering of the Great Depression, Flynn’s radicalism led her to join the Communist Party. Almost immediately, she began writing a column on women’s issues for the Daily Worker newspaper, predecessor of today’s People’s World. That column would run weekly for the next 26 years. In a short time, she was elected to the CPUSA’s National Committee.  During the global fight against Hitler fascism and Japanese imperialism during World War II, Flynn played a key role on the home front. She led struggles for equal pay for the women who replaced men on the assembly lines and agitated for day care centers for these working mothers.  In 1942, she ran for Congress in New York, making unity in the fight against fascism and the battle for equality at home the primary planks of her campaign. She earned 50,000 votes.  After the war, Red Scare repression returned. A dozen top leaders of the CPUSA were arrested in 1948 and accused of violating the Smith Act under the false charge of “conspiring to advocate the overthrow the government by force and violence.” The Rebel Girl was a central leader in the movement to defend not only the Communist leaders but also the First Amendment from those who wanted to see it destroyed.  When a second wave of anti-communist arrests was launched in 1951, Flynn was thrown in jail with 16 other party members. At the opening of her federal trial, she declared:  We are not a criminal conspiracy, but a working-class political party devoted to the immediate needs and aspirations of the American people, to the advancement of the workers, farmers, and the Negro people, to the preservation of democracy and culture, and to the advocacy of socialism.  Even if the jurors did not agree with the Communist Party’s politics, she urged them to remember that in a democratic society, the mere act of thinking should never be made a criminal offense.  “Let none of us forget, especially in this trial in dealing with new ideas and proposals for social change,” she said,  the wise words of Abraham Lincoln: ‘This country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it.’  Nine months later, the court handed down a guilty plea, and Flynn was sent to Alderson Prison in West Virginia for the next two years—along with Claudia Jones and Betty Gannett, two other women party leaders charged under the Smith Act.  As Prisoner #11710, Flynn set down on paper the details of life in a federal women’s correctional facility, published later as My Life as a Political Prisoner: The Alderson Story. She detailed not only the physical brutalities of incarceration but also its psychological toll:  The heavy shadow of prison fell upon us in those three days—the locked door and the night patrol. The turning of a key on the outside of the door is a weird sensation to which one never became accustomed. One felt like a trapped animal in a cage.  She also took the opportunity to expose the classist and racist nature of America’s prison-industrial complex. “No rich women were to be found in Alderson,” she wrote, highlighting how the prison system mostly consumed poor and working-class women, the majority Black and Spanish-speaking with past lives defined often by abuse, mental illness, or drug addiction.  Following her release from the penitentiary, Flynn didn’t hesitate to jump right back into leftist political work and Communist activism. She also ran for office again, putting her name forward for New York City Council in 1957.  In 1961, her long years of work were recognized by comrades, who elected her to become chairperson of the Communist Party, the first woman to ever hold the position. After winning back her passport from the government, Flynn traveled to the Soviet Union in 1964 to spend time working on her next book. While there, however, she became ill and passed away at the age of 74.  Over 25,000 people turned out for her state funeral in Moscow’s Red Square. Her remains were returned to the U.S., where they were buried in Chicago’s Waldheim Cemetery, near the Haymarket Martyrs and other labor heroes.  Flynn described herself as a “professional revolutionary, an agitator” against the injustices of capitalism, racism, and misogyny. As Prof. Mary Anne Trasciatti wrote:  It is no exaggeration to claim that Elizabeth Gurley Flynn was involved in almost every major campaign of the U.S. left in the first two-thirds of the twentieth century.  And it is that life lived in struggle which so irritates conservatives in New Hampshire; they simply can’t stand for the erection of a historical marker that might remind people of such a figure or prompt them to learn more about her, or, heaven forbid, follow in her footsteps.  Sununu shrinks  So, it is no surprise that Gov. Chris Sununu quickly acted on the demands of his fellow Republicans on the Executive Council who said the historical marker in Concord was “inappropriate, given Flynn’s communist involvement.” Since the marker was on state property, his office had power to order its destruction.  Sununu’s spokesperson, Ben Vihstadt, said on Monday,  All policies and guidelines were followed in removing this controversial marker.  Supporters of accurate history differ with Sununu. They accuse the state of violating its own rules for the markers, rules which say that markers can only be “retired” if they “contain errors of fact, are in a state of disrepair, or require refurbishment.” None of those apply in the Flynn case.  “We still say that under the department’s own guidelines, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn’s birthplace in Concord is a fitting location for a historical marker,” said Mary Lee Sargent, a former U.S. history teacher and labor and women’s rights activist.  The sign was approved last year by the Concord City Council after a recommendation from the state marker program, which is run by the N.H. Historical Resources Division and the Transportation Department.  A commissioner for the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources says the marker program is popular “because it’s initiated at the local level,” with no “top-down effort” to populate New Hampshire with historical markers of elected officials’ own political heroes nor to cleanse the state of their ideological foes.  With the intervention of Sununu and reactionaries at the highest levels of state government, that tradition is over. Anti-communism may have won out, but perhaps there is a silver lining.  Thanks to all the media coverage conservatives have generated with their contrived controversy, more people will probably learn about Elizabeth Gurley Flynn from articles like this one than would have ever read a plaque at the courthouse in downtown Concord.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vbXJvbmxpbmUub3JnLzIwMjMvMDUvMjIvNjAteWVhcnMtYWZ0ZXItZGVhdGgtZWxpemFiZXRoLWd1cmxleS1mbHlubi1zdGlsbC1zY2FyZXMtdGhlLXJpZ2h0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Even then, many will have to sit on the ground for an unknown amount of time before being seen. Responding to this crisis, Doctors Without Borders are tending to Cabo Delgado’s residents. Its presence in the region involves community-based services by providing mobile clinics, aiding local hospitals and improving access to health care for displaced people who are returning due to the violence.  Palma, a town in Cabo Delgado, has seen improvements in security. With the ongoing aid from Doctors Without Borders, multiple primary health care mobile clinics as well as the district hospital make Palma the only functional health facility within the district.  Philip Aruna, the Regional Support Team leader of Doctors Without Borders for Southern Africa said to AllAfrica “…today we are talking about people going back. I saw lots of people going back to Palma so meaning the situation, seems to be improving.”  Pregnant women and Children  As well as providing essential medical services, the humanitarian organization is also supporting pregnant women and young children. Since October 2021, its health promotion team in Mueda has collaborated with traditional birth attendants and community leaders in order to ensure that women experience a safe pregnancy. One of the team’s objectives is to have more women enter hospitals so they get support through a safe birth.  To achieve this, birth attendants organize regular talks with pregnant women to spread health promotion messages and inform them of the organization’s transportation services to the hospital. One transport method known as the chopela, is always available to transport people to the hospital. From the camp in Eduardo Mondlane in Mueda, the percentage of pregnant women who delivered their babies at a medical facility increased from 33% in January 2022 to 75% in April 2022.  Mental Health Activities  Due to the ongoing violence, hundreds of thousands suffer from its effects. Fear and displacement have also contributed to their distressed physical and mental health. Everyone in the region has experienced and continues to experience trauma. Many are from witnessing “violence or from losing loved ones and their homes.” With the crisis taking a toll on people’s mental health, Doctors Without Borders have provided almost 3,500 individual mental health consultations and arranged group mental health activities for more than 64,000 people in Cabo Delgado.  Its activity in 2021 includes the provision of mental health support to internally displaced people who fled the Palma attacks in March of the same year. The organization of mental health sessions in the Nangua camp aids those displaced by the armed conflict, encouraging them to talk about their experiences and receive PTSD support.  The ongoing efforts of Doctors Without Borders provide the necessary aid, support and hope for Cabo Delgado’s displaced people. In multiple districts, it is the only organization with a regular presence. Assistance is disproportional across Cabo Delgado, with aid being more frequent in the province’s south.  Regardless, its continuous work of providing access to mobile clinics, mental health aid, assisting hospitals and supporting safe pregnancies is one that dutifully serves those impacted by Cabo Delgado’s violent conflict.  – Grace Clay  Photo: Flickr","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvcmdlbm1hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS9jYWJvLWRlbGdhZG8v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Sting Ray Robb, a 21-year-old driver for Dale Coyne Racing, has Sting Ray on his birth certificate — and he’s not named after the fish, either. His parents, who are Chevrolet enthusiasts, named him after the sports car Chevrolet Corvette Stingray.  Ironically, the IndyCar rookie is driving the No. 51 Dallara-Honda for Dale Coyne Racing — straying from his Chevrolet roots. He is in Sunday's :Last Chance Qualifying for the Indianapolis 500, competing with three other drivers for the final three spots in the race.  But as Robb realizes his dream on the IndyCar circuit, his parents have been supportive.  “That's a tricky question,” Robb said of his parents’ love for Chevrolet. “Yeah, my parents are big Corvette fans, and I think that they ruled out criticizing me too badly because they know the dream is IndyCar. I'll be in a Honda car and I'm assuming it'll go pretty quick, so I'm okay with all of that.”  And he doesn’t need to change his name to NSX, another sports car with a Honda engine.  “My name is my name,” Robb said. “I don't need a rename. Thank you.”  How Robb joined Dale Coyne Racing:Sting Ray Robb assumed Linus Lundqvist had Coyne ride. Indy Lights champ still sidelined  After transitioning from the developmental Indy NXT league, Robb is in his first season as an IndyCar driver. He got into the No. 51 seat by chance, taking the offer after he found out Linus Lundqvist wasn’t going to take it.  “I think the driving style is fairly similar moving from Indy Next to IndyCar,” Robb said. “My first day in the car it felt very natural. It felt like it was an Indy Next car that did what I wanted it to do. I didn't have to wrestle it around as much. But at the same time, you had more tools at your disposal. Obviously more speed, more power, better handling, the tires are much grippier. I think the biggest thing for me to learn would be on the strategy side, pit stop side of things, because that's nothing what we've had to do before.”  Robb is one of two full-time Dale Coyne Racing drivers, joining 21-year-old David Malukas. Malukas qualified for the Indy 500 on Saturday, sitting in row 8 at 23rd in the field.

Although cervical cancer has received attention through nationwide screening program and the rollout of the human papillomavirus vaccine, endometrial and ovarian cancers have attracted less attention. The age-period-cohort analysis of constant-relative-variation method was used to estimate the mortality trends of cervical, endometrial, and ovarian cancers for population aged 30-84 years during 1981-2020 in Taiwan. The years of life lost was used to estimate the disease burden due to premature death from gynecological cancers. The age effect of endometrial cancer mortality was greater than those of cervical and ovarian cancers. The period effects decreased during 1996-2000 for cervical cancer and plateaued for endometrial and ovarian cancers during 2006-2020. The cohort effect decreased after the birth year 1911 for cervical cancer, increased after 1931 for endometrial cancer, and increased in all birth years for ovarian cancer. For both endometrial and ovarian cancers, the Spearman’s correlation coefficients revealed the strong negative correlations between the fertility and the cohort effects, and the strong positive correlations between the average age at first childbirth and the cohort effects. The burden of premature death from ovarian cancer was higher than those of cervical and endometrial cancers during 2016-2020.

"birth","1985-01-01","Not Discerned","{""NewYork"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T09:03:21","""The prevailing idea of adoption is tidy and neat,"" Angela Tucker writes in her new book You Should Be Grateful. ""It’s a simple recipe. A family with extra love and resources meets a child in need of both. What’s not to love about this?""  Tucker was born in 1985 in Chattanooga, Tenn., to an African-American mother who bore four other children and did not raise any of them. Her biological father did not know about her birth—he was a developmentally disabled man who lived on the streets and made money standing outside of bars selling flowers that were donated to him.  After a brief stint in foster care, Tucker was adopted by a white couple in Bellingham, Washington. By her own account, she had a wonderful childhood with loving siblings and parents. Despite being born partially deaf and with legs turned in such a way that doctors did not expect her to walk (both most likely the result of drug use by her mother), Tucker was a star athlete and musician. Over the years, people have told Tucker she should be ""grateful,"" and she is. But she worries that people don’t really understand that adoption is complicated, that she also wished the circumstances of her birth parents were different.  Her adoptive parents share this view. As she writes: ""They fearlessly understood and named the paradox that they were so happy I’d joined their family and also longed for a world in which Deborah could have kept me.""  So who thinks adoption is a ""simple recipe"" where we take a child away from their birth parents and just throw them into another family? Certainly no one who has been adopted or who has placed a child for adoption or who has adopted. Of course, there are people who haven’t given the concept of adoption much thought at all. For them, Tucker’s vivid description of the complex emotions that accompanied her on the journey to finding her birth family will be an education. And maybe it will stop them from saying insensitive things to Tucker and others in her position. But there is a point in all of our lives when we accept that strangers make ignorant comments, and it’s not really worth losing sleep over all of them.  When I was pregnant with my first child, a stranger came up to me at a wedding and asked how I felt knowing that this child (who would presumably have dark skin like my husband) would be ""totally alienated"" from me. At some point you just shake your head or throw your drink, but you have to move on.  There are complexities to growing up black in a white family in a white town in a white state. But the ones Tucker points to suggest a bizarre understanding of racial identity. For instance, she notes that she was always louder and dressed more colorfully than other members of her adoptive family or people in her town. Is that because she’s black? Another black adoptee tells her that her tastes in food differed from her adoptive parents. And another says she felt at home with her birth parents because they shared her sense of humor and sarcasm. No one doubts these adoptive children sometimes felt out of place in their families. But is this because of their race?  And no one doubts that adoptive children sometimes adapt ""people-pleasing behaviors"" in order to fit in. But there are a lot of non-adoptive children who share the same race as their parents who also feel they don’t fit in with their families. In fact, for the demographic of mostly teenagers that Tucker is mentoring, one might assume that such discomfort is actually the norm—even among children raised by their biological parents. But when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. When you view everything through the lens of adoption and race, then you lose sight of all the normal challenges young people face. Indeed, you lose sight of the fact that many people exist in this intersection of happiness and tragedy.  The parents who lose a child to cancer but then decide they want to have another one. The widower who finds love and marries again. There is not a day that these people don’t wish the world could be different, but then they also know that the joy they experience every day would not have been possible without the tragedy that preceded it.  Much of Tucker’s book is devoted to the ways she would fix the world so that Deborah could have kept her. And most of the problem in Tucker’s view is racism. Black people are held, she says, to a different standard than white people when it comes to their behavior, a white standard. She says that the nine children who integrated the elementary school in Little Rock were taught that ""acting white"" was essential to their success. This might have come as news to their parents and civil rights leaders at the time, who thought practicing nonviolence and acting respectfully was not the exclusive province of white people.  But you can tell where Tucker comes down on the civil rights movement when she describes Malcolm X as ""a proponent of nonviolence."" That picture of him with a rifle looking out his window is just an aberration?  The legacy of racism and ""ancient historical trauma"" have caused Deborah’s problems, she writes. When Tucker first approaches her birth mother and Deborah denies that Tucker is her daughter, she speculates that Deborah was experiencing ""unmetabolized trauma from the past."" This is a grown woman who travels with a doll that she talks about as if she were a real baby. There is no doubt that Deborah has experienced trauma—substance abuse, mental illness, perhaps even abuse and neglect when she was young—but one needn’t go back to ancient times to find it.  Though Tucker knows Deborah could not have raised her, she says she is angry at the child welfare system ""that assumes black children must be saved from the social ills of their culture, which is quick to believe glossy social media posts that depict wokeness."" She also blames the ""war on drugs."" Whether or not the war on drugs was a good thing generally has little to do with whether individual parents’ drug use made them incapable of caring for young children. Tucker knows that she was not removed from Deborah’s home because of black culture. She was removed because Deborah couldn’t care for her. One of Tucker’s sisters was initially left with Deborah but was actually raised by a grandmother briefly and then was just bouncing to different friends’ homes.  Much of the book describes her anger at not meeting her birth family sooner. She had what is called a ""closed adoption,"" where information wasn’t provided to her family about her birth mother and she could not access it. But very few adoptions are closed anymore. She believes that open adoptions ""end up looking closed"" because once an adoption is finalized, the adoptive parents can decide how much contact their child will have with their biological parents.  Tucker dismisses ""safety concerns"" cited by adoptive parents in limiting the contact with biological parents. But frankly there are real issues here and though lawmakers in New York recently proposed mandating visitation for birth parents even after adoptions are finalized, this would seriously infringe on adoptive parents’ rights to be real parents to their children. And it would probably discourage adoption generally.  You Should Be Grateful is ultimately a mishmash of Tucker’s own story, which is both moving and fascinating, with ""research"" she has picked up from progressive academics. For instance, she touts ""blind removals"" whereby agencies decide whether to put a child in foster care without revealing the race of the child to the people making the decision. She says this dramatically altered racial disparities in foster care. In fact, the agency that was doing it just changed the way they were counting kids and when it compared apples to apples, the percentage of black kids removed went up and down in no discernible pattern.  Tucker is right that adoption is not neat. And any policy solutions to the problems of our child welfare system will have to recognize the complexity of these issues. Unfortunately, when Tucker turns from the personal to the political, all her nuance seems to go out the window.

Karima Jiwani, 40, has been charged with criminal attempt to commit murder, aggravated assault, reckless abandonment, and cruelty to children in the first degree.  On the night of June 6, 2019, two teenagers got worried when they heard what they thought sounded like a baby crying in the woods near their home. Eventually they notified their father, who originally thought the sound was an animal, and the family started searching their property and the words nearby. Minutes later, they found a newborn baby, bloodied with her umbilical cord still attached, wrapped in a plastic bag.  “This child was tied up in a plastic bag and thrown into the woods like a bag of trash,” Forsyth County Sheriff Ron Freeman said in a press conference. “I can’t understand that.”  Without any identification, the baby was given the name “India” and was rushed to a local hospital. Baby India is now almost four years old, and is prospering, happy, and healthy, according to the sheriff.  Throughout the press conference, Sheriff Freeman only referred to Jiwani as India’s “biological parent” as he said he has trouble with saying the suspect is actually her mother.  “How a parent, and I happen to be one too, can do such a callous thing, is both incomprehensible to all of us, and is infuriating,” Sheriff Freeman said emotionally. “I’m dumbfounded by any reasoning that could be there, and how somebody could have the ability to leave their own child to die.”  The sheriff’s office worked with Othram Labs to identify India’s birth parents so detectives could ultimately investigate the case and make an arrest. Othram Labs “uniquely offers in-house processing of evidence, from DNA extraction, enrichment, and repair, to sequencing and genealogy.”  Forsyth County deputies said they were able to identify India’s father 10 months ago and have since been working intensive surveillance and background data collection to identify and link Jiwani to the crime.  The sheriff confirmed there is “zero evidence” that Baby India’s biological father had any idea about the pregnancy or abandonment of the little girl. Evidence from the crime scene also shows only one person was most likely there, investigators said.  Jiwani has a history of “hidden and concealed pregnancies,” detectives explained, stating after interviews with family and friends, she knew about India’s pregnancy and went to extremes to conceal it. The sheriff went on to say Jiwani had several “surprise births.”  At the time of her arrest, Jiwani was living with her own “additional children.” The sheriff said they are between “school aged to near adult.” The department of children and families has been notified about their care and this case, as Jiwani is now being held in jail without bond.  “No motive can justify this decision,” Sheriff Freeman said. “It it literally one of the saddest things I have ever seen.”  [callout-content]  More Law&Crime Coverage: Former ‘teacher of the year’ charged with sexually abusing teen boy, may have more victims: Deputies  The deputy who rescued India was one of the officers who arrested Jiwani.

However, being a nurse in a neonatal intensive care unit, especially if it’s only one in the area, can come with its own set of challenges.  The Ascension Sacred Heart Emerald Coast Family Birth Place is the only NICU in the Okaloosa and Walton County area. NICU nurses say they’re preparing to help as many families as possible as the panhandle population continues to grow.  These nurses care for ill and premature babies who need around-the-clock assistance. They say they’re responsible for checking babies’ vital signs, breathing habits, feeding schedules, and more. NewsChannel 7 was told the strong bond they create with the babies and their families is truly rewarding.  “We are there with them as they’re nervous and concerned if their baby’s going to be healthy,” RN Supervisor of the NICU Brandy Kirby said. “What’s this going to look like long-term for them? So, really, the most rewarding and probably important thing the nursing staff and the physicians in a Level II NICU do is support the Mom and Dad.”  Other doctors say they love seeing parents’ reactions to hearing when their baby can go home. Neonatologists say premature babies can stay at a hospital anywhere from a couple of days to even months depending on the severity.  “You know, when you look at Mom and Dad and tell them their baby’s ready to go home, and it’s coming, and it’s the day,” Dr. Ayman Khmour said. “The joy you see on their faces; it’s priceless. You cannot put a price tag on that. You know, it happens almost every day, but it’s different with every family. The way they interact with it, the way they react to it is precious.

"birth","2006-07-22","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T13:13:05","Courtesy of Iris Anderson The author at the Great Wall of China. “I felt so accomplished after hiking and loved every minute of it,” she writes.  The first time I was in China, I became one of her lost girls. As I was taken from my birth mother’s arms and placed at a nearby train station, I became a statistic ― another baby uprooted by the country’s one-child policy. At 11 months old, I was plucked from China’s embrace and placed into that of my parents. My roots began to grow in the soil of a different land.  When I was old enough to comprehend the gravity of my truth, my parents sat me down and told me that I had been adopted from China. This supposed revelation did not alter the trajectory of my life as my parents feared it might. It was fairly easy, even as a child, to recognise that I did not look like those around me, especially my parents. In fact, I found it quite awesome to be different ― to have come from a country so rich with history and culture.  Advertisement  However, the reality of living in a town with a predominantly white population is that many of its residents ostracise anyone who is different. I tried desperately to fit in with the other kids, but it became clear early on that despite my parents’ whiteness, my Chineseness would always make me an outsider.  Growing up, I listened as friends discussed which parent they resembled the most, and I grappled with the guilt that came with wishing I could participate in those discussions. I laughed along with others as they asked me to talk to them in “my language” and proceeded to speak gibberish in a way that was supposed to imitate Mandarin. For years, I didn’t know how to feel, or if my feelings were even valid. I didn’t realise that these seemingly small acts of aggression were racist and that they would grow into hatred in the future.  Courtesy of Iris Anderson The now-abandoned train station where the author was left as a baby.  The first time I returned to China with my parents, I was 9 years old and longing for a place filled with people who looked like me. I was completely in awe of the country that created me, and this is when I first realised that I needed to embrace being Chinese. This proved nearly impossible. It was obvious that I did not belong to those who lived in China. From the way I dressed to the language that I spoke ― or couldn’t speak ― to them, I was American through and through.  Advertisement  As the trip went on, I found myself becoming increasingly disconnected from China and Chinese culture. I felt like a foreigner in a country that I desperately believed should have felt like home. This was the revelation that changed the trajectory of my life: My identity as a transracial adoptee seemed to define me everywhere I went. I was too Chinese to be American in America, and I was too American to be Chinese in China.  As I grew older, it became more common for adults to ask me how lucky I felt to be adopted from China, and I became resentful at how their questions commodified me. If I did not respond with gratitude for being adopted, it was as if a switch flipped in their mind and they saw me as a selfish girl who owes her parents everything. I left an abundance of words unsaid. To these people, this topic seemed clearly black and white: I was adopted from China after being left at a train station and should be grateful for my parents’ generosity ― for the roof they put over my head and the food they put on my plate.  Obviously, I love my parents. They have given so much to me and I would not be where I am today without them. My epiphany occurred when I realised that I am allowed to simultaneously love my parents and grieve what I lost. While transracial adoptees may be placed into amazing, loving families, it does not change the fact that their culture was stolen from them.  I have always belonged to an in-between place: not quite Chinese, but definitely not white either. The spaces and resources available to transracial adoptees are few and far between despite how large our population is, especially in the United States. My parents never hid the fact that I was Chinese, and they did the best that they could to expose me to Chinese traditions, but their efforts had their limits. Still, I am lucky to have parents who wanted and pushed for me to be connected to the country in which I was born.  Courtesy of Iris Anderson The author with her parents in front of the Temple of Heaven in Beijing. “I remember that day being miserably hot, but I really enjoyed being there with my parents,” she writes.  Advertisement  When I came to them about wanting to feel more connected to China and Chinese culture, they searched for years to find someone who could teach me Chinese. Unfortunately this task proved immensely difficult, so instead I began teaching myself the basics. My parents promised to take me back to China as soon as possible, especially now that I was older and could understand the importance of the trip a little bit more. They could tell I was struggling to reconcile my identities and always made sure that I knew I could lean on them for support. Unlike others, my parents never held my emotions against me and were ― and still are ― pillars of support.  The second time I returned to China, I was 15 and felt more in touch with my emotions. I wanted to build connections with other adoptees and hear their stories. This trip, which catered to adoptees from the same agency, allowed me to spend time with others who had been taken into white families.  Together, we found and created a safe environment for each other where we could talk about our experiences and vent our emotions without fear of judgment. This visit was different for me. I felt seen and heard by others who experienced the same inner turmoil that I had. Together we laughed and cried and lamented what could have been. In another life, would we have been able to meet under different circumstances?  It didn’t matter, we answered. We realised that all that mattered was what we had now, a fragmented past blended with a found family, each other included. While we didn’t all have the same goals for our return to China, we did share one: to reconcile our guilt and our curiosity. For me, I held no anger toward my birth mom for giving me up, especially when I understood the state of China and the one-child policy. But the curiosity of knowing about where and who I came from was there, and probably always will be. By the end of the trip, I cannot say that this goal was completely achieved. But while it might sound cliche, we adoptees did find each other, and in some way that was worth more to us than our original goals.  When I returned to the United States, I finished high school with a different perspective than the one I entered with. I felt able to embrace my in-between identity and reconcile the parts of me that had always felt at odds. Still, I lean on those I have found on my journey and continue to search for others who help me feel whole.  Advertisement  Courtesy of Iris Anderson The author and the adoptee friends she made. “We were having so much fun at that point in our trip and were always asking our parents to take pictures of us together,” she writes.  All transracial adoptees deserve to have a place where they can release their emotions and feel a sense of community. While I know not all transracial adoptees will want or be able to return to their country of birth and connect with others who have shared experiences, I hope they can find another way to build a community, perhaps through local groups or online. Being able to share my thoughts, emotions and challenges ― which I worried only I was thinking, feeling and facing ― with people like me has changed my life for the better.  It has been a difficult adventure to reach a place where I feel comfortable with who I am ― Chinese, American and an adoptee ― but it has allowed me not only to deepen my roots, but also to make flowers bloom in my life today.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5odWZmaW5ndG9ucG9zdC5jby51ay9lbnRyeS9pLXdhcy1hZG9wdGVkLWZyb20tY2hpbmEtcGVvcGxlLWFzay1pZi1pLWZlZWwtbHVja3ktYW5kLW15LWFuc3dlci1pc250LXdoYXQtdGhleS1leHBlY3RfdWtfNjQ2YTE4OTZlNGIwMDA1YzYwNTllMjI40gGfAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmh1ZmZpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvLnVrL2FtcC9lbnRyeS9pLXdhcy1hZG9wdGVkLWZyb20tY2hpbmEtcGVvcGxlLWFzay1pZi1pLWZlZWwtbHVja3ktYW5kLW15LWFuc3dlci1pc250LXdoYXQtdGhleS1leHBlY3RfdWtfNjQ2YTE4OTZlNGIwMDA1YzYwNTllMjI4Lw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

PHOTO/Courtesy  English scientists have made an innovation that will in future save mothers from massive loss of blood after giving birth.  This latest development after trials were carried out are published in the New England Journal of Medicine that found E-Motive is capable of reducing heavy bleeding by 60 per cent.  Postpartum haemorrhage is the cumulative blood loss of 500 millilitres or more in a spontaneous vaginal delivery and approximately 1,000 millilitres or more for caesarean section birth and a leading cause of maternal mortality.  Each year, about 14 million women experience Post Partum Haemorhage (PPH) resulting in about 70,000 maternal deaths globally.  Even when women survive, they often need urgent surgical interventions to control the bleeding and may be left with life-long reproductive disability.  E-Motive has been termed as a major breakthrough in reducing deaths from childbirth-related bleeding.  The landmark study published recently by researchers from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the University of Birmingham defined PPH as the loss of more than 500 mililitres of blood within 24 hours after birth.  It is the leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide. It affects an estimated 14 million women each year and results in around 70,000 deaths — mostly in low and middle-income countries — equivalent to one death every six minutes.  Researcher Bethuel Kinuthia says in Kenya, postpartum haemorrhage accounts for 34 per cent of maternal deaths in Kenya.  The WHO guidelines on postpartum haemorrhage are not always followed despite being prominently promoted in hospitals, says Kinuthia.  In her study Doris Mumbi Muthoni recommends the need to train midwives on skills of PPH management to prevent postpartum hemorrhage. “Postpartum haemorrhage is scary, not always predictable, but absolutely treatable. Nonetheless, its impacts around the world are tragic,” said Dr Pascale Allotey, Director of Sexual and Reproductive Health and Research at WHO.  “Effective solutions to tackle postpartum bleeding need to be available and accessible so that all women can experience a safe birth and a healthy future with their families,” said Dr Allotey.  The study, which involved over 200,000 women in four countries, found that objectively measuring blood loss using a simple, low-cost collection device called a ‘drape’ and bundling together WHO-recommended treatments — rather than offering them sequentially — resulted in dramatic improvements in outcomes for women.  When severe bleeding — when a woman loses more than a litre of blood after birth — was reduced by 60 per cent, women were less likely to die.  There was also a substantial reduction in the rate of blood transfusions for bleeding, which is of particular importance in low-income countries where blood is a scarce and expensive resource.  “This new approach to treating postpartum haemorrhage could radically improve women’s chances of surviving childbirth globally, helping them get the treatment they need when they need it,” said Professor Arri Coomarasamy, who led the trial and is the Co-Director of the WHO Collaborating Centre on Global Women’s Health at the University of Birmingham.  “Time is of the essence when responding to postpartum bleeding, so interventions that eliminate delays in diagnosis or treatment should be gamechangers for maternal health.  “Currently, a major challenge in responding to PPH is that it is often detected too late to respond effectively,” he added.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBkLmNvLmtlL25ld3MvbmV3LWlubm92YXRpb24tdG8tY29udHJvbC1wb3N0cGFydHVtLWJsZWVkaW5nLTE4MTU3OS_SAVNodHRwczovL3d3dy5wZC5jby5rZS9uZXdzL25ldy1pbm5vdmF0aW9uLXRvLWNvbnRyb2wtcG9zdHBhcnR1bS1ibGVlZGluZy0xODE1NzkvP2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act was passed by Parliament in 2018 to secure the fundamental rights of transgender Pakistanis. It ensures their access to legal gender recognition, among other rights.  Many Pakistanis have entrenched beliefs on gender and sexuality and transgender people are often considered outcasts. Some are forced into begging, dancing and even prostitution to earn money. They also live in fear of attacks.  The Federal Shariat Court on Friday struck down several provisions of the landmark law, terming them “un-Islamic.”  It ruled that a person cannot change their gender on the basis of “innermost feeling” or “self-perceived identity” and must conform to the biological sex assigned to them at the time of birth.  The Shariah court has the constitutional mandate of examining and determining whether laws passed by Pakistan’s parliament comply with Islamic doctrine.  Around a dozen activists protested in the southern port city of Karachi on Saturday against the ruling.  Members of Pakistan's transgender community gesture plan to appeal an Islamic court’s ruling that guts a law aimed at protecting their rights. Fareed Khan / AP  Lawyer Sara Malkani, who was speaking at an event organized by the Gender Interactive Alliance, denied the legislation was un-Islamic. She said the existence of two genders did not limit the concept of gender identity and that Islamic texts, including the Quran, did not associate specific behavior to specific genders.  “We absolutely intend to appeal the court’s findings to the Supreme Court, and we will prevail,” said Nayyab Ali, executive director of Transgender Rights Consultants Pakistan, at a news conference Friday.  Ali said the transgender community was “mourning the decimation” of Pakistan’s first transgender rights protection legislation in response to the Islamic court’s finding.  However, clerics and representatives from religious parties say the law has the potential to promote homosexuality in this conservative country with a Muslim majority. They want the Islamic court to annul the law.  The Shariah court ruled that the term “transgender” as it is used in the law creates confusion. It covers several biological variations, including intersex, transgender men, transgender women and Khawaja Sira, a Pakistani term commonly used for those who were born male but identify as female.  It also rejected a clause in the law in which the country’s national database and registration authority permits the change of a person’s biological gender from the one they were assigned at birth in identification documents including drivers licenses and passports.  It said permitting any person to change their gender in accordance with his or her inner feeling or self-perceived identity will create “serious religious, legal and social problems.”  For example it will allow a transgender woman — a person who is biologically male — to access social and religious gatherings of females or women-only public places, and vice versa, it said.  “This law will pave the way for criminals in society to easily commit crimes like sexual molestation, sexual assault and even rape against females in the disguise of a transgender woman,” the court ruled.  However, the court said Islamic law recognizes the existence of intersex people and eunuchs and said they should be entitled to all the fundamental rights provided to Pakistanis in the constitution.  The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan expressed dismay over the “regressive ruling” and said the denial of transgender people’s rights to self-perceived gender identity seeks the “erasure of an entire demographic and its fundamental rights.” It said rolling back the transgender bill will lead to further marginalization and abuse of an already vulnerable community in Pakistan.  Amnesty International called on the government to stop any attempts to prevent transgender people from obtaining official documents reflecting their gender identity without complying with abusive and invasive requirements.  “This verdict is a blow to the rights of the already beleaguered group of transgender and gender-diverse people in Pakistan,” said Rehab Mahamoor, research assistant at Amnesty International, in a statement.  She said any steps to deny transgender and gender-diverse people the right to determine their own gender identity would violate international human rights law.  Sana, 40, a eunuch in Rawalpindi who asked to be identified by one name, told The Associated Press on Saturday that she favored the court’s ruling because a large number of gay men were being included in her “original and by-birth” eunuch community.  She alleged that those who become transgender men through surgical castration are “denying the rights” of her community by affecting their access to employment opportunities under the government’s job quota reserved for their community.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY25ld3MuY29tL25ld3Mvd29ybGQvcGFraXN0YW4tdHJhbnMtYWN0aXZpc3RzLWFwcGVhbC1zaGFyaWFoLWNvdXJ0LWxhdy1jaXZpbC1yaWdodHMtcmNuYTg1NDQ40gEqaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmJjbmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9hbXAvcmNuYTg1NDQ4?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"birth","2023-05-20","Not Discerned","{""Cannes"", ""ProvenceAlpesCoteDAzur"", ""France""}","2023-05-21T23:28:26","By JAKE COYLE (AP Film Writer)  CANNES, France (AP) — It was well into the process of making “Killers of the Flower Moon” that Martin Scorsese realized it wasn’t a detective story.  Scorsese, actor Leonardo DiCaprio and screenwriter Eric Roth had many potential avenues in adapting David Grann’s expansive nonfiction history, “Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI.” The film that Scorsese and company premiered Saturday at the Cannes Film Festival, however, wasn’t like the one they initially set out to make.  The film, which will open in theaters in October, chronicles the series of killings that took place throughout the Osage Nation in 1920s Oklahoma. The Osage were then enormously rich from oil on their land, and many white barons and gangsters alike sought to control and steal their money. Dozens of Osage Native Americans were killed before the FBI, in its infancy, began to investigate.  DiCaprio had originally been cast to star as FBI agent Tom White. But after mulling the project over, Scorsese decided to pivot.  “I said, ’I think the audience is ahead of us,” Scorsese told reporters in Cannes on Sunday. “They know it’s not a whodunit. It’s a who-didn’t-do-it.”  The shift, filmmakers said, was largely driven from collaboration with the Osage. Osage Nation Chief Standing Bear, who consulted on the film, praised the filmmakers for centering the story instead on Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and her husband Ernest Burkhart (DiCaprio), the tragic romance at the heart of Scorsese’s epic of insidious American ethnic exploitation.  “Early on, I asked Mr. Scorsese, ‘How are you going to approach the story? He said I’m going to tell a story about trust, trust between Mollie and Ernest, trust between the outside world and the Osage, and the betrayal of those trusts,” said Chief Standing Bear. “My people suffered greatly and to this very day those effects are with us. But I can say on behalf of the Osage, Marty Scorsese and his team have restored trust and we know that trust will not be betrayed.”  “Killers of the Flower Moon,” the most anticipated film to debut at this year’s Cannes, instead became about Ernest, who Scorsese called “the character the least is written about.”  DiCaprio, who ceded the character of White to Jesse Plemons, said “Killers of the Flower Moon” reverberates with other only recently widely discussed dark chapters of American history.  “This story, much like the Tulsa massacre, has been something that people have started to learn about and started to understand is part of culture, part of our history,” said DiCaprio. “After the screenplay, from almost an anthropological perspective — Marty was there everyday — we were talking to the community, trying to hear the real stories and trying to incorporate the truth.”  “Killers of the Flower Moon” premiered Saturday to largely rave reviews and thunderous applause nearly 50 years after Scorsese, as a young filmmaker, was a sensation at Cannes. His “Taxi Driver” won the Palme d’Or in 1976.  Among the most-praised performances has been that of Gladstone, the actor of Blackfeet and Nimíipuu heritage.  “These artistic souls on this stage here cared about telling a story that pierces the veil of what society tells us we’re supposed to care about and not,” said Gladstone, who singled out Scorsese. “Who else is going to challenge people to challenge their own complicity in white supremacy in such a platform except as this man here?”  “We’re speaking of the 1920s Osage community. We’re talking about Black Wall Street and Tulsa. We’re talking about a lot in our film,” she continued. “Why the hell does the world not know about these things? Our communities always have. It’s so central to everything about how we understand our place in the world.”  In the film, Robert De Niro plays a wealthy baron who’s particularly adept at plundering the Osage. Speaking on Sunday, De Niro was still mulling his character’s motivations.  “There’s a kind of feeling of entitlement,” said De Niro. “It’s the banality of evil. It’s the thing that we have to watch out for. We see it today, of course. We all know who I’m going to talk about but I won’t say the name. Because that guy is stupid.

Her labour was a ‘long and exhausting’ one, sources said, with her manager later telling Metro.co.uk she was now the mum of twins.  A close friend revealed: ‘Amy’s welcomed boy and girl twin babies. ‘She’s overjoyed, but exhausted after a long labour.’  In her upcoming ITVBe show, titled The Twin life, the TV personality details how baby Billy was hospitalised with fluid in his lungs shortly after his birth.  According to The Sun, cameras show Amy dealing with a traumatic birth which leads her to undergo an emergency C-section.  However, there was more drama after the birth, with Billy taken to the neo-natal unit for two days, before being allowed home.  Amy admitted she was ‘panicking’ over the twins’ birth after suffering from ‘belly ache’ and calling the hospital.  Despite having been through pregnancy and childbirth twice before, Amy previously wrote that she feels like she had gone ‘back to square one’ as she frets over the health of her babies.  Writing in her column for OK!, the reality star opened up about a recent incident in which she couldn’t get to sleep, and in the middle of the night her stomach began ‘cramping’.  Everybody, meet Millie and Billy! (Picture: Instagram)  ‘I’ve had it before, it’s not like it’s my first baby, but I said to Bill that something felt different,’ she said.  After first feeling the cramping at around 1am, the mum-of-two stuck it out until 3.30am, when she called the hospital and explained she had a ‘belly ache and bad belly pain’.  She added that she could feel her babies moving and being ‘really active’, and worried that she would go to the hospital only to be told she was having Braxton Hicks, or false labour pains.  ‘I’m a worrier, so if the babies weren’t moving I’d have definitely gone down to hospital,’ she added.  Metro.co.uk has reached out to Amy Childs’ reps for comment.  The Twin Life premieres on Tuesday May 23 on ITVBe.  Got a story?

Take the Maternity and Paternity Leave Bill, 2023, which applies to all public and private establishments under the federal government’s administrative control including companies, factories, autonomous and semi-autonomous organisations, etc, wherever they may be in the country. It allows women up to six months’ leave for the birth of their first child, and four and three months on the birth of the second and third child respectively — all on full pay.  This is a more generous allowance than what was so far available. New fathers will be entitled to a month’s fully paid leave upon the birth of their child, for up to three times during their term of service.  The Day Care Centres Act, 2023, mandates all government and private organisations within the Islamabad Capital Territory with at least 70 employees to set up a day care centre on their premises. Another bill passed by the NA makes educational institutions a more child-friendly space by requiring paramedical staff to be available on the premises of all such institutions in ICT.  Working women here are hampered by stereotyping and bias that imperil their employment, not to mention their aspirations for career advancement. The Global Gender Gap Index Report 2022 ranked Pakistan 145/156 for economic participation and opportunity.  According to the ILO, women account for around 22pc of the labour force, one of the lowest female labour force participation rates in South Asia. Among the many barriers are inadequate maternity leave provisions; while such legislation exists across all provinces, it varies considerably.  At 16 weeks, Sindh offers the longest leave on maternity grounds while the other provinces offer 14 and 12 weeks. Passing a law stipulating paid paternity leave is also a progressive move, which acknowledges that men too have a role to play in this life event.  The lack of day care facilities on the job further facilitates women’s employment, instead of compelling a choice between maternal duties and work. Pakistan cannot afford to lose out on women’s participation in its economic life.

Their babies are almost 2 times more likely to die in their first year, often because they were born too soon (preterm).  Changing this is a priority for closing the gap in First Nations health outcomes. Closing the Gap Target 2 is ‘Children are born healthy and strong’.  Success in Brisbane’s Birthing in Our Community service  Yvette led the Indigenous Birthing in an Urban Setting study (IBUS) to help close the gap in Brisbane. The exemplar Birthing in Our Community service reduced First Nations preterm births from 14.3% to 8.9%. There were other improvements:  more First Nations women were seen in early pregnancy  women needed less intervention during birthing  more mothers were breastfeeding  fewer babies were admitted to neonatal units.  ‘We saw all these amazing clinical outcomes that we have not seen before in Australia,’ Yvette says. ‘The Birthing in Our Community service also saw a cost saving of $4810 for every mother-baby pair to the health system, compared to standard care.’  Redesigning maternity services  ‘These outcomes were the result of redesigning maternity services,’ Yvette explains. ‘A mainstream service, Mater Hospital, partnered with two First Nations community-controlled health services. They were the Institute of Urban Indigenous Health and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Service Brisbane.  ‘The community-controlled services created a community hub to provide services outside the hospital. Feedback from the women about the hub was it “feels like home” and “feels like a black space”. This safety net for women was critical to the outcomes.’  Translating the study across Australia  With funding from the MRFF, Yvette is translating IBUS in the Birthing on Country project. Birthing on Country will transform maternity care for better outcomes for First Nations mothers and babies across Australia.  Yvette is working with multiple partners who want to redesign maternity care in their rural, remote and very remote settings. The partners include:  South Coast Women's Health and Wellbeing Aboriginal Corporation (Waminda), NSW.  Central Australian Aboriginal Congress Alukura Maternity Services, NT.  Yalu Aboriginal Corporation in Galiwin’ku and Miwatj Health Aboriginal Corporation, NT.  NT Health, NSW Health, Congress of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Nurses and Midwives, Australian Doula College, Care Flight, Australian Red Cross, My Midwives, and DK Legal.  First Nations values  The partners are using the RISE SAFELY implementation framework. ‘RISE SAFELY is underpinned by First Nations values, ways of seeing, doing, and being,’ Yvette says. Services are redesigned in 3 phases:  antenatal and postnatal programs are informed by First Nations knowledge. redesigned services incorporate continuity of midwifery care, modified for the remote context, and include a First Nations workforce. new services with 6 components operate from community-based hubs: multiagency partnerships and First Nations governance  continuity of midwifery care  First Nations workforce  cultural safety framework  holistic wrap around services  coordinated care integrating primary care with tertiary services.  ‘Each activity happens at a different pace, but we need to work on all activities to have sustainable outcomes,’ Yvette explains.  Birthing on Country gives mothers cultural safety  ‘Birthing on Country gives First Nations mothers and mothers carrying First Nations babies cultural safety where they give birth,’ Yvette says.  ‘If I’m in a remote community and I am at high risk, I might choose to fly out to a hospital at 36 weeks. But I want a safe place to land when I'm there. I want to be able to have an interpreter. I want to be able to stay in a place I feel safe. I want to eat food that I'm familiar with. I want to know my midwife.  ‘At the moment, the hospital biomedical model, what we call standard care, denies a lot of women those choices. But the evidence tells us the biomedical model is failing First Nations and non-First Nations women.’  There are still barriers to Birthing on Country  Implementing Birthing on Country faces barriers in each location. ‘Barriers include legislation that stops us from rolling out some of the approaches that we know work best,’ Yvette says.  ‘In some First Nations communities having small babies is almost normalised. We need to break through this by people understanding what the number story means. They need to know our babies are born too small or too early and their sickness is not normal.  ‘Providing an avenue for Indigenous knowledge makes that discussion richer and the solutions even more dynamic.’  Following in her mother’s footsteps  Yvette is following in her mother’s footsteps. ‘I had a mother who was a community midwife. All the families would birth each other's children,’ Yvette tells us.  ‘Birthing is our first ceremony where we've passed from mum into the world, so it's a very symbolic and powerful ceremony. It is unacceptable that our women and babies are dying prematurely. The system sometimes traumatizes them, hurts them and in an extreme case kills them. This is a human rights issue. I am passionate about it.’  The MRFF funded The Birthing on Country: RISE SAFELY in rural, remote and very remote Australia program with $5 million.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlYWx0aC5nb3YuYXUvbmV3cy9iaXJ0aGluZy1oZWFsdGh5LWFuZC1zdHJvbmctYmFiaWVzLW9uLWNvdW50cnnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

While there is a whole alphabet soup of chemicals that are harmful to human health, research has shown phthalates and BPA/BPF/BPS to be particularly dangerous. The former makes plastic soft, like the flimsy water bottle you get at the gas station, and the latter makes plastic hard, like a sturdy reusable water bottle that can go in the dishwasher.  These chemicals interfere with human hormones like estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone, which is why they are commonly referred to as endocrine disrupters. Many scientists and environmental experts have linked the rise of these endocrine disrupters in our environment to disturbances in reproductive function such as declines in fertility, higher rates of miscarriage, and changes to the number and quality of eggs in ovaries. From 1973 to 2011, the total sperm count of Western men dropped by 59%, which makes sense when you know that exposure to endocrine-​disrupting chemicals can reduce levels of testosterone in males.  Shanna Swan, Ph.D., a leading environmental and reproductive epidemiologist from Mount Sinai Medical Center, found that pregnant women who were exposed to endocrine disrupters were giving birth to male children with measurably smaller penises and anal-genital distance. In other words, the chemicals that the pregnant women were exposed to lowered the testosterone levels in their male fetuses enough to have physically measurable impacts. Scientists have been observing this exposure effect in male frogs, for instance, for decades, but to see it shown in humans is alarming, to say the least.

The recently released ‘Born Too Soon: Decade of Action on Preterm Birth’ report by WHO, UNICEF and Partnership for Maternal New Born and Child Health highlights myriad impacts of climate change both direct and indirect on pregnancy resulting in stillbirths, preterm birth and small for gestational age.  Climate change impacts pregnancy through heat exposure, storms, floods, drought, wildfires and air pollution besides in terms of food insecurity, water or food borne diseases, vector borne diseases, migration, conflict and health system resilience, according to experts.  The report suggested more investment is needed to specifically mitigate risks and to increase focus on women and babies in policies and programmes addressing the climate emergency.  Air pollution is estimated to contribute to six million preterm births each year.  “Vulnerability to climate change is a multi-dimensional, dynamic phenomenon shaped by intersecting historical and contemporary political, economic and cultural processes of marginalisation. Societies with high levels of inequity are less resilient to climate change,” said Dr Ana Bonell from Medical Research Unit at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM).  According to the report, climate change has a harmful impact during the perinatal period. It increases the risk of preterm birth by direct pathways, such as air pollution caused by burning fossil fuels which increases risk by 52 per cent in asthmatic mothers; extreme heat exposure which increases risk by 16 per cent and other extreme weather events, such as drought.  “Although the impacts of climate change are being felt in all areas of the world, the people most affected have contributed least to the crisis. For example, globally, 91 per cent of deaths of preterm babies related to air pollution occur in low and middle income countries, while high income countries make the greatest contribution to climate change,” the report said.  Recent estimates suggest that household air pollution was an attributable factor for 15.6 per cent of all low-birth-weight babies and 35.7 per cent of all preterm births, notably in low-income countries, it pointed out.  A study on 92 pregnant women in Gambia by LSHTM showed that every extra degree Celsius in extreme heat stress caused a 17 per cent increase in strain on the foetus, specifically by raising fetal heart rate and slowing blood flow through the umbilical cord.  Another study showed a macro-level association between climate change vulnerability and women and children’s health (WCH) at the district level in India, as districts that had high levels of climate change vulnerability also performed poorly in WCH.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbGxlbm5pdW1wb3N0LmluL25hdGlvbi85MS1kZWF0aHMtb2YtcHJldGVybS1iYWJpZXMtaW4tbG93LWFuZG1pZGRsZS1pbmNvbWUtbmF0aW9ucy1kdWUtdG8tYWlyLXBvbGx1dGlvbi01MTk0NTfSAYABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWlsbGVubml1bXBvc3QuaW4vYW1wL25hdGlvbi85MS1kZWF0aHMtb2YtcHJldGVybS1iYWJpZXMtaW4tbG93LWFuZG1pZGRsZS1pbmNvbWUtbmF0aW9ucy1kdWUtdG8tYWlyLXBvbGx1dGlvbi01MTk0NTc?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

""I did not want people to know that my body was changing [and that I was experiencing] female puberty,"" he says.  For Erik, making peace with his period took a while. He had his period in the third grade – earlier than most of his friends. It took Erik almost a decade to understand and appreciate his own body.  Erik said that it was in his university years that he finally accepted that his period was also a part of how his body operates.  ""There were days when I repressed my identity until I met the trans men community, where I learned that our reproductive system doesn't define our gender,"" Erik says.  For him, learning more about the concept of sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and sex characteristics (SOGIESC) finally helped him accept his body.  ""I learned from the studies of SOGIESC that sex and gender are two different things. I learned how my body functions, that having a uterus in my reproductive system doesn't make me a woman,"" he says.  Erik said the main reason he had difficulty dealing with his period was that society judges a person's gender based on their reproductive system and physical appearance.  ""Society tends to put you in a box. If you have a vagina and uterus, you must have a child and assign your gender role as a woman. If you don't follow the normative system, they may label you a sinner,"" he said.  ""I think it's important for trans men to learn more about the reproductive system. I feel that the trans men community is often marginalized and forgotten.""  Meanwhile, Santi, a non-binary individual from Tangerang who chose not to divulge their real name, shared that having periods had caused them to experience gender dysphoria and mental health issues. (Santi asked to use their/they/them pronouns).  Santi admitted that getting their first period left them feeling embarrassed and uncomfortable with their own body because they were aware that when they got their first period, their body would begin to go through puberty and gain more ""feminine"" characteristics, with larger breasts one of their insecurities growing up.  ""I prefer to have nothing down there,"" the 21-year-old said.  The second oldest of the four siblings shared that growing up in a strict household had made their situation even more challenging. Santi often confided about their period experience with their brother, also a transgender man.  Veron, a transmasculine and third-year political science student in the Netherlands, experienced health concerns because of an irregular menstrual cycle and was told by their doctor"" to grow and dress more femininely"" during a medical visit.  Hence, Veron felt that their worries were dismissed. They shared, ""I have an actual health problem, and they believed that the problem was from what I wore.""  ""The doctor said if my menstruation is irregular, it's simply because I have short hair and a 'tomboy' appearance. My identity as non-binary, transmasculine or agender may only be indirectly related,"" they add.  Difficult: Ayu R. Yolandasari says that the lack of safe spaces in public areas, such as public restrooms, also exacerbates dysphoria among transgender men and non-binary individuals regarding their periods (Courtesy of Ayu R. Yolandasari) (Archive/Courtesy of Ayu R. Yolandasari)  Ayu R. Yolandasari, a gender, sexuality and mental health specialist based in Jakarta, said there were three main reasons transgender men and non-binary individuals had a complex relationship with menstruation.  Ayu said that as a society, Indonesia tended to be heteronormative and had a binary view of gender.  In a heteronormative society, Ayu said, society often judged individuals by the gender they were assigned at birth. In this case, an individual is born with a vagina and uterus, thus they will be assigned female at birth for their sex category.  ""Society tends to view the individual as female or automatically assume the person's gender identity as a cisgender woman,"" Ayu affirmed. However, Ayu continued that the assumption from society was not always correct because people may identify themselves with different gender identities.  Moreover, Ayu added, in society, individuals often identify periods or menstruation as an experience identic with cisgender women or those assigned female at birth and who identified themselves as female later.  ""In a heteronormative society, people consider that only cisgender women experience menstruation. Although, menstruation is not an experience that exclusively happens to cisgender women, as it's a cycle for anyone born with a uterus or ovaries,"" she says.  It is common for menstruators to experience physiological and psychological discomfort during the period moreover, if they undergo premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), a depressive disorder linked to menstruation.  Transgender men and nonbinary individuals are often dismissed. Ayu explained that the experience of menstruation is one way that the identities of trans and nonbinary individuals are often devalued or invalidated by society.  ""The invalidation generated from society ultimately makes the trans and non-binary group experience their identity crisis and intensify their dysphoria,"" Ayu says.  In addition to facing discrimination from various groups, transgender friends have more difficulty getting their menstrual supplies because of the attached stigma.  ""A lack of access can be due to the dysphoria or extreme anxiety experienced by trans friends, resulting from the gap between the gender they perceive and the gender they were assigned at birth,"" Ayu explained.  As a minority group, Ayu added that the anxiety of the transgender men and non-binary community can be heightened when trans men have to use period-related products in gendered public restrooms.  Ayu noted that trans men may feel uneasy around other people in the men’s bathroom since the sound of the plastic wrap of pads was strongly associated with feminine things that could risk their safety if anybody notices their presence in the male-signed restroom.  ""That thing [menstrual product] also relates to their body and may remind them that their body has been made to validate their identity,"" they say.  The lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) communities are prone to stigma and discrimination from society. Research by the Legal Aid Institute (LBH) in 2017 showed that 973 people became victims of stigma, discrimination and violence due to their sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression by not conforming to heteronormative binary norms.  The survey showed that transgender individuals had the highest number of reported cases, with 715 incidents, gay individuals with 225 incidents and lesbians reporting 29 incidents.  More feasibility  Erik highlighted that there had always been communities welcoming trans men. ""Understanding SOGIESC creates a more coherent framework that enables the trans community to accept themselves more easily,"" he says.  Despite the unavailability of SOGIESC education to everyone, Ayu stressed the importance of educating society about SOGIESC. The heteronormative paradigm dominating our community inevitably exacerbates how marginalized groups like non-binary people and transgender men suffer.  ""Moreover, we must challenge the belief that the natural state of menstruation is a normal woman-specific experience. Even for cis-females, especially those with PMDD, a period may be an unpleasant experience leading to suicidal thoughts,"" Ayu adds.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWpha2FydGFwb3N0LmNvbS9jdWx0dXJlLzIwMjMvMDUvMjIvdHJhbnMtYW5kLW5vbi1iaW5hcnktaW5kaXZpZHVhbHMtdGFsay10aGUtcGFpbi1vZi1wZXJpb2RzLmh0bWzSAXRodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVqYWthcnRhcG9zdC5jb20vYW1wL2N1bHR1cmUvMjAyMy8wNS8yMi90cmFucy1hbmQtbm9uLWJpbmFyeS1pbmRpdmlkdWFscy10YWxrLXRoZS1wYWluLW9mLXBlcmlvZHMuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"birth","2023-05-16","14:00:00","{""Melbourne"", ""Victoria"", ""Australia""}","2023-05-21T15:00:00","When I describe myself as “trans” I often feel strangers’ eyes scan up and down, assessing my appearance for evidence, signifiers of how this silhouette was built. When people ask invasive questions about my hormonal or surgical journey, growling beneath their words is another implicit enquiry: are you the “before” or “after” picture of your gender transition? But my experience of being trans is not a future destination I will one day arrive at or a version of myself I have already departed from.  Perhaps this comes down to linguistic confusion: people often assume that “trans” is an abbreviation of “transitioning”. Yet the word “trans”, in this context – as opposed to the context of, say, a public transport service or an eminent Death Cab for Cutie album – is short for transgender, which the Oxford dictionary defines as “a person whose gender identity does not correspond with the sex registered for them at birth”. On most birth certificates, there is an M or F box ticked for newborn babies. So at the level of language, to be transgender means not aligning one’s own identity with that rigid box on an official document – and there was no non-binary option on mine.  Not every non-binary person labels themselves under the transgender umbrella – but some do. My transness is not about feeling uncomfortable in my body; it is about feeling uncomfortable with the gender that was allocated to this body. Although I was once assigned female at birth, on days when I wear winged eyeliner and a crop top that makes my boobs look great, I am still non-binary. Medically transitioning, sometimes involving hormone therapy or surgical procedures, can constitute an integral part of a person’s journey of gender affirmation – but pursuing this process is not a prerequisite of being trans or non-binary, and does not determine the validity of anyone’s gender identity. Imagining it as a checklist overlooks the barriers often encountered by trans people who want to medically transition – such as inaccessibility, costliness, wait times and stigma perpetuated by some practitioners. To suggest that being trans requires a specific type of transition is to enforce a hierarchy that is ultimately elitist.  ‘Rather than changing my body, I was changing the ways I inhabited my body.’ Photograph: Allen & Unwin  The assumption that every trans person wants to transition also reproduces stale discourse that all trans folk feel “born into the wrong body”: a stereotype that shouldn’t be uniformly applied. As poet Sam Rush writes, “I wasn’t born into the wrong body, I was born into the right lesson.” For some people, transitioning is literally lifesaving – but squeezing all trans narratives into a narrow trope erases individual experiences, minimises us into a caricature of ourselves, and is ultimately boring. Trans and non-binary folk inhabit more than one character description. Besides, just because someone pursues transition doesn’t mean they hate their body. Consider the moment when you change your outfit just before leaving the house; it’s not that you necessarily hated the initial fit, you just want to wear something that makes you feel more like yourself.  Gender euphoria is not only experienced by trans folk; it can be a community act, it can be wearing a new jumpsuit, it can be changing from the soprano to alto parts when you sing your favourite song on the freeway. My early journey towards non-binary joy involved eyeliner pencils, boxer briefs and crossing the road while holding hands with someone I loved. Many of these steps felt like dance moves; new, juicy ways I learned to move my body and twist my hips, to grind air and frolic in front of my own mirrors. Rather than changing my body, I was changing the ways I inhabited my body.  There is not a right or wrong way to be trans. My experience is not a universal narrative. Every trans person I know has a unique relationship with how their body moves through the world – as does every cisgender person I know. The labels we use are a personal choice, and the language we choose for ourselves deserves to be heard. As Nevo Zisin writes: “Pronoun use is not political correctness, it is suicide prevention.”  Considering the etymology of the word “trans” as “beyond”, to be transgender can be understood as existing “beyond gender”. Echoing this, recent books by gender-nonconforming trans authors Alok Vaid-Menon and Travis Alabanza both feature the word “beyond” in their titles. Fitting into neither of the pink-and-blue boxes offered on my birth certificate, my gender exists beyond; a box that is yet to be ticked, a colour that has no name. I do not believe I was born wrong. I love this trans body; freckled face, underarm hair, tattooed calves and the same hourglass figure as my mother. Although I was assigned female at birth, celebrating my body and my femininity doesn’t make me any less non-binary. Instead, it makes me happy.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vYm9va3MvMjAyMy9tYXkvMjIvaS1kb250LWZlZWwtbGlrZS1pLXdhcy1ib3JuLWludG8tdGhlLXdyb25nLWJvZHktdGhlcmVzLW5vdC1hLXJpZ2h0LW9yLXdyb25nLXdheS10by1iZS10cmFuc9IBiQFodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vYm9va3MvMjAyMy9tYXkvMjIvaS1kb250LWZlZWwtbGlrZS1pLXdhcy1ib3JuLWludG8tdGhlLXdyb25nLWJvZHktdGhlcmVzLW5vdC1hLXJpZ2h0LW9yLXdyb25nLXdheS10by1iZS10cmFucw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"birth","2022-07-26","Not Discerned","{""Washington"", ""DistrictOfColumbia"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T13:30:43","To reinforce that “breast is best” for babies and that formula feeding is inferior, in 2022, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) affirmed its decades-long stance in favor of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF), meaning nothing but breastmilk, arguing for this in the first six months and calling breastfeeding and human milk “normative” and “a public health imperative.” The policy stated that “medical contraindications”—reasons not to breastfeed—“are rare”; the only “true” ones, according to the organization, are infants with galactosemia (a metabolic disorder) or parents with HIV.  Looking back at my own experience, I’m convinced that the pressure to breastfeed contributed to my developing postpartum anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder. I later learned that this pressure could harm mental health in even more acute ways, including potentially increasing the risk of suicide. I was struggling but determined to breastfeed exclusively because I believed that it would reduce my child’s risk for several diseases and boost lifelong achievement. I was wrong, largely because I was misled. As a reproductive rights activist and journalist who has covered issues concerning kids and food since 2014, I agree with the growing opposition to the decree that exclusive breastfeeding is imperative. Barriers to breastfeeding are real and disproportionately affect marginalized people, many of whom return to work not long after childbirth. The fight for the right to breastfeed rages righteously, and I consider myself a fervent supporter. At the same time, adoptive and other parents who can’t provide human milk or choose not to feel shamed. No matter how cherished our right to breastfeed is, so is our right to feed our infants with or without our bodies.  Because we are told that science shows that “medical contraindications” to exclusive breastfeeding are rare, millions of parents wonder what’s wrong with us when it doesn’t work out. Though breastfeeding proponents suggest that true physiological issues that contribute to low milk supply are “rare,” this science is hardly conclusive. Some studies show that everything from breast surgery to polycystic ovarian syndrome to diabetes to chronic stress and far more can disrupt lactation, and, together, these conditions affect far more than one in 10 birthing folks. Christie Del Castillo-Hegyi, an emergency medicine physician, mom of three, and co-founder of the nonprofit Fed is Best Foundation (FIBF), says that the push for universal EBF makes it “difficult to understand the nuances, the exaggerations and the risks of such a recommendation.” The FIBF’s mission is to advocate for families who have encountered complications in attempting to adhere to EBF. The reliance on breastfeeding can also lead to a violation of children’s right to be satiated.  Proponents often say that breastfeeding is “free,” but it’s not. There’s the cost of our time, effort, pumping equipment and the pausing of pursuits. Those costs and benefits vary for different people. I didn’t realize that EBF would take so much out of me. As I recovered from a traumatic birth, my baby cried unless she was on my breast, which many EBF advocates say is normal, so I nursed constantly. When we were discharged from the hospital, she had lost 9 percent of her birth weight, which was within the 7–10 percent that’s considered normal in an EBF newborn in many birthing facilities. I was told to continue nursing “on demand” at home. On day four of her life, I was devastated to learn that she had lost over 12 percent of her weight. Our doctor recommended supplementing with formula, assuring us that it would be okay and that I could wean off formula in a few days. I felt anything but okay.  Fortunately, my newborn didn’t have to be readmitted to the hospital, or worse. It’s crucial to know the signs that a newborn isn’t getting enough milk, including crying all the time when not on the breast. Extreme dehydration can have severe immediate and long-term consequences. Rarely, it can be fatal. EBF advocates suggest that colostrum, or drops of the clear substance excreted before copious milk production, is plenty to feed a newborn in the first few days of life. But it’s not always enough. EBF is not Mother Nature’s design. Caregivers have fed infants substances in addition to or instead of their own birth parents’ milk and in many cultures for a slew of reasons, including milk supply taking a few days to “come in” and personal preference. These alternatives included milk from human wet nurses and animal milk.  Bottles of formula saved my baby and me. That weekend, following frequent breastfeeding sessions, my partner topped off our voracious newborn with formula while I spent another 20 minutes with an electric pump to further stimulate milk production. The three-day around-the-clock ordeal produced the desired effect. Soon, I was making enough milk, and we ditched formula. It didn’t occur to me that I had the choice to skip the strife and use formula from the get-go instead of avoiding it, using it with a sense of shame and then toiling to stop using it.  “The amount of emotional freight that's attached” to EBF “is grossly disproportionate to the benefit,” says Daniel Summers, a pediatrician and father of four who supports patients’ choice to use formula. The formula industry’s predatory historical and current practices don’t mean that formula is inherently bad or that human milk is “best.”  None of this is to say that it’s a lie that breastfed infants fare better than their formula-fed peers on a population level. Rather, it’s not the human milk conferring better outcomes. The bulk of infant feeding data are observational and come with confounders. In wealthier nations, people who breastfeed tend to be more financially secure, live near fewer hazards and have stable co-parenting relationships. Sibling studies account for these confounding factors because siblings are exposed to similar environments. In 2014, U.S. researchers looked at thousands of siblings born since the 1980s. Breastfed babies from different families had a lower incidence of asthma, hyperactivity, and more; they also showed higher reading and math comprehension than formula-fed babies. When they compared babies who were breastfed with siblings who received formula, almost all of those differences became insignificant.  The bottom line is, safe human milk, infant formula prepared correctly with safe water, or a combination of both are fine choices for full-term infants. Privilege and better outcomes go hand in hand. For meaningful interventions that lead to positive outcomes, Summers would like to see support around “the actual logistical needs” of disadvantaged families. An important note: human milk has been shown to protect premature newborns from a life-threatening bowel infection that can cause holes in intestinal walls. For full-term infants, even though breastmilk contains some remarkable substances, there isn’t evidence that it’s the mechanism behind superior short-term and long-term outcomes.  It’s easier to put the onus on parents to exclusively breastfeed than to solve systemic problems that impact kids’ well-being. All humans have the right to consider the pros and cons of using their bodies to feed their newborns and make their own informed choices, including the choice to use formula, whether the reason is a medical contraindication or straight-up not wanting to.

"birth","2023-06-25","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T22:54:18","Everyone born on June 25th has Cancer as their sun sign. In astrology, the sun sign is the most commonly talked about because it is the easiest to figure out. It is simply based on the date of your birth, while the other astrological aspects such as your Moon sign or rising sign are based on the exact time and place of your birth as well. Your full birth chart can give you a lot of information about your tendencies and personality. Several apps and websites can give you this information, or you can see a professional astrologer.  June 25 Zodiac Sign: Cancer  Cancer is represented by a crab symbol. ©Pike-28/Shutterstock.com  Cancer is the 4th sign in the zodiac, between Gemini and Leo. It is the first sign of the summer season in the northern hemisphere. The sign Cancer starts June 21 and ends July 22. Cancers are very home and family oriented. Their happiest place is at home, cooking or providing for their closest people. They are very sentimental and love to reminisce about the good times. On the flip side of that, they always remember who has wronged them. They may not forget but they can forgive.  While Cancers can be social, especially with their family or crew of best friends, they need their alone time to recharge. If they don’t get that, they can get moody or crabby. Cancers are emotional in general, and they can go through bouts of depression. They are also not the best at expressing their emotions. Their intuition is so good that they always seem to know what everyone else is thinking. So, they can get frustrated when other people can’t read their minds.  Cancers are tough on the outside and soft on the inside. So, if you feel like it is hard to get to know a Cancer, don’t worry, it’s not you, it’s just their nature!  The 4th House in Astrology  Everyone has 12 houses in their astrology chart. Each house is ruled by a different sign. Cancer rules the 4th house as the 4th sign. So, the 4th house is all about the home and family. The sign that you have for your 4th house in your personal chart influences how you feel about home and family.  The Decans of Cancer  June 25th falls into the first decan of Cancer. Decans are smaller sections of each sign. The first decan of Cancer is ruled by Venus and gives people born on June 25 a love of beauty, romance, and perhaps fertility. People born in the first decan, which goes from Jun 21 to July 1, may be excellent gardeners or have an interest in creating their own family.  June 25 Zodiac Ruling Planet: The Moon  Earth’s moon rules the zodiac sign Cancer. ©bhcvn/Shutterstock.com  Cancer is the only zodiac sign to be ruled by the Moon, which is our planet’s closest luminary. This gives Cancers a different relationship to their ruling object than other signs. Each month, the Moon moves through every single zodiac sign. It also changes its phase daily. The moon is connected to magic, the subconscious, and emotions. Because of Cancer’s special connection, their moods may be particularly affected by the Moon’s phases and movements.  The Moon is also part of what gives Cancer their amazing intuition, which can seem like a psychic power to those who are not Cancers.  June 25 Zodiac Element: Water  Water rules the zodiac sign of Cancer. ©Alexey Stiop/Shutterstock.com  The three water signs are Cancer, Pisces, and Scorpio. In general, water signs are emotional and intuitive, but Cancer may be the most intuitive of all three. Water signs also have artistic or creative tendencies. This may show up in unconventional ways. Creativity can be applied in many different environments.  All water signs love security so they can have the same job and the same partnership for a long time. They tend to have steady friendships and appreciate loyalty. However, these qualities have a more difficult side too. Water signs tend to get overly identified with their relationships. They can even hold onto relationships for too long because they highly value security. So, they may have a hard time leaving unhealthy relationships.  June 25 Zodiac: Cardinal  Cancer is a cardinal sign, like Libra, Capricorn, and Aries. These signs are the leaders of the zodiac. They come at the beginning of each season. Cancer might be the most low-key leader of all the cardinal signs, but they still have this quality. Because of their sensitive and intuitive nature, they are most likely to lead subtly, using their people skills to guide people along the way.  June 25 Numerology and Other Associations  For numerology, there are two ways we can look at the date June 25th.  2 + 5 = 7  6 (for the month of June) + 2 + 5 = 13 which simplifies to 4  People who relate to the number 7 may be more spiritual and can have more typically “feminine” hobbies and tastes. 7s are independent people who like to travel and may incorporate their love of long voyages into their work. Like Cancer, 7s take relationships very seriously and don’t like to date casually.  People with the number 4 in their life work really hard in life to get what they want. They are very professional people, even in their personal life. Number 4s prefer to be on time and always respond to messages, etc. They are very analytical and can be great in jobs that require logical thinking. However, they would rather let someone take credit for their work than be in the spotlight.  June 25 Birthstone  Cancers have three birthstone options to choose from, unlike other birth months which get one or maybe two choices. Pearl, moonstone, and alexandrite all relate to the sign of Cancer in different ways. Pearl and moonstone resemble the moon. Alexandrite relates to the mystical side of Cancer because it changes color in different lights.  June 25 Zodiac: Personality and Traits  Each zodiac sign has some stereotypical traits. However, they can show up differently in different people! You never know how someone’s astrology will affect them exactly. Plus, the sun sign is just one small part of the chart. There is a lot more information to be gained from a full chart reading. All that is to say, don’t judge someone based on their sun sign!  Deep Feelers  Cancers are emotional. They feel things quite deeply. To those who are on the outside, a Cancer person can even seem to try to manipulate people with their emotional reactions to things. However, their reactions to things are usually genuine. It’s simply that they wear their heart on their sleeve, especially with those who are closest to them.  Devoted  Cancers are deeply loyal to those who they care about. When they don’t know you, they can seem a bit standoffish. They love their crew and don’t have much room for others in their life. They also go off of vibes. If the vibe feels off they might just ghost you without an explanation because they are all about the emotional connection with their friends. Cancers are also very protective of their friends and likely won’t become friendly with anyone who has wronged someone they love. This loyalty can also lead to jealousy in friendships and romantic relationships.  Peace-Loving  Cancers love a peaceful, carefree environment. They want their home to be a quiet, safe, and comfortable place. This love of peace and quiet can have a more challenging side to it. It can cause Cancers to avoid confrontation. Part of this is that they expect people to know what they are thinking. The other part is that they would rather just avoid any kind of hard conversation. So, resentments can build up and then explode when it gets to be too much. Cancers can work on this by working with a coach or therapist or studying mindfulness to recognize their feelings.  Nurturing  Cancers are usually the “parent” friend of the group. If you go out for a night on the town, they are the one making sure everyone is well-hydrated and gets home safe. They love to spoil their loved ones with care packages and plan fun parties for everyone. However, Cancers can forget to nurture themselves. They burn out quickly unless they remember to pamper themselves once in a while too! Part of this nurturing identity comes from Cancer’s tendency to imagine the worst possible scenarios and prepare for them. The other part comes from their natural connection to home and family through their astrological positioning.  June 25 Zodiac: Career and Passions  Cancers can make great veterinarians! ©iStock.com/herraez  Each zodiac sign can do well in any career of their choosing. However, there are some jobs that Cancers may enjoy more than others. They are great at nurturing professions such as:  Nursing  Daycare provider  Teacher  Social worker  Therapist  Speech therapist  Nanny  Chef  Veterinarian or vet-tech  Cancers are also great with money. They love security so they tend to develop a passion for saving and planning. Because of this, Cancers can make great financial planners or financial coaches.  They can also put their intuitive nature to work. They make amazing office managers, HR associates, and marketing associates because of their unique insights into what people are thinking. This is also part of what makes them great therapists.  Cancers also love being at home, so they can do great at jobs that allow them to work from home, or that allow them to improve other people’s homes, like becoming an interior designer.  Because Cancers love stability, they may have the same job or career for a long time. They also usually prefer to work in typical employment situations rather than owning their own business or freelancing.  June 25 Zodiac in Relationships  Cancers do not usually do casual relationships. They are all about that loyalty and often want someone to meet them in a deep partnership. They love cozy dates at home, and they want to feel appreciated in their relationship. In return, they will lavish their partner with nurturing affection. They are quite romantic and love big gestures. They can plan things like candlelit dinners and special moments to treasure forever.  Cancers love hard and deep. This is a great thing when they find a partner who wants the same thing. However, their loyal nature can get them into trouble when it comes to this aspect. They can stick around in relationships even when there are red flags and stay in bad or even unsafe relationships for far too long because they value loyalty so highly. Plus, Cancers love being in relationships so much that it is easy for them to lose their identity or become codependent in their relationship. To avoid this, Cancers can stay in touch with friends and family, and make sure to keep some time for themselves outside of their relationships.  Compatibility for June 25 Zodiac  Cancers are most compatible with Taurus, Capricorn, and Scorpio. The two earth signs Taurus and Capricorn also love security. Taurus loves a comfy home and together a Cancer and Taurus may create an amazing home environment. Cancer and Capricorn are actually astrological opposites, but sometimes opposites attract.  Scorpio is a fellow water sign. With Cancer, the relationship will be deep and moody. If both people can support the other partner in their low moments, it can be a beautiful partnership!  Fire signs are not the best match for Cancers. Leo, Sagittarius, and Aries love to travel and are very confrontational. Their fiery nature can upset a Cancer’s non-confrontational preferences.  June 25 Zodiac Mythology  The crab that is the symbol of Cancer comes from an Ancient Greek legend. The crab was immortalized as a constellation after Hera, a Greek goddess, sent a crab beast to mess with Heracles while he was fighting another, even more intense beast: a nine-headed hydra. Heracles killed the crab easily and then went on to defeat the hydra too.  Cancer’s connection to the Moon also has roots in Greek mythology. Selene was the goddess of the moon. Like Cancer, she was very family oriented. She had more than 50 children. She was also a goddess that was associated with romance and mysticism.

Players will be selected from each birth year to participate in USA Hockey's Select 15, 16 or 17 Camp during the summer in Amherst, N.Y. I made my picks based on the numbers for each birth year, which are as follows:  2006: Nine forwards, five defensemen and one goalie  2007: Seven forwards, four defensemen and one goalie  2008: 10 forwards, five defensemen and two goalies  While I don't decide who goes, I thought it'd be a fun exercise to make my own selections to send to camp. The official picks are slated to come out early this week. When they're live, we'll have them here.  Let's dive in.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvY2tleWpvdXJuYWwuY29tL3ByZWRpY3Rpb25zLXdoby13aWxsLW1vdmUtb24tZnJvbS1tYXNzLWhvY2tleS1mZXN0aXZhbC1maW5hbC00MC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"birth","2023-05-18","14:00:00","{""BambergCounty"", ""SouthCarolina"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T00:00:00","BAMBERG — Years before the Bamberg County Hospital closed in 2012, and the next-closest hospital in neighboring Barnwell shut its doors in 2016, those facilities had stopped delivering babies.  These days, there’s not even an ultrasound machine in this rural county 60 miles south of Columbia, much less an obstetrician. Pregnant women here are left with few options for care.  Federally qualified health centers offer prenatal services in nearby Fairfax and Barnwell, but only when a pregnancy is uncomplicated and only through about 34 weeks of gestation.  During the final weeks of pregnancy, women must transfer their care to the nearest obstetrician, often in Orangeburg, which can be 20 miles away or more, depending on where they live in Bamberg County. Some women travel farther to hospitals in Aiken or Beaufort, where health outcomes are better.  “Most of our women are driving an hour or more from their homes to an OB provider,” said Tracy Golden, a doula and senior program manager for the South Carolina Office of Rural Health.  Although the regional hospital in the city of Orangeburg delivers babies, the birth outcomes in the county are awful by any standard. In 2021, nearly 3 percent of all Black infants in Orangeburg County died before their 1st birthday.  Nationally, the average is about 1 percent for Black infants and less than 0.5 percent for White infants.  Meanwhile, Orangeburg County’s infant mortality rate for babies of all races is the highest in South Carolina, according to the latest data published by the state Department of Health and Environmental Control.  By 2030, the federal government wants infant mortality to fall to 5 or fewer deaths per 1,000 live births. According to annual data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 16 states have already met or surpassed that goal, including Nevada, New York and California. But none of those states are in the South, where infant mortality is by far the highest in the country, with Mississippi’s rate of 8.12 deaths per 1,000 live births ranking worst.  Even in those few Southern states where infant mortality rates are inching closer to the national average, the gap between death rates of Black and White babies is vast. In Florida and North Carolina, for example, the Black infant mortality rate is more than twice as high as it is for White babies. A new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that, over 20 years, Black people in the U.S. experienced more than 1.6 million excess deaths and 80 million years of life lost because of increased mortality risk compared with White Americans. The study also found that infants and older Black Americans bear the brunt of excess deaths and years lost.  That makes Black infant mortality in the South a complex regional crisis that should alarm everyone, not just future parents, said Georgina Dukes-Harris, senior director for social care at Unite Us, a national technology company focused on societal needs. Birth outcomes for mothers and infants are a leading indicator of population well-being and they run much deeper than health care: They reflect politics. They’re a direct product of generational poverty and racism. They reveal our priorities, Dukes-Harris said.  Often, babies die under circumstances that states, communities and parents can help control, like making sure infants don’t suffocate in beds or in unsafe cribs, or extending health coverage so that young women can afford to see a doctor before they become pregnant. In many of these respects, the South is failing.  “This is something that has to change,” Dukes-Harris said.  ‘An urgent problem’ with no easy solution  Public health officials are still trying to parse the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, but infant death rates in South Carolina were higher than the national average long before the health care landscape changed in 2020. And a report published by the state Department of Health and Environmental Control in April shows the rate for non-Hispanic Black babies — who died at a rate nearly 2½ times that of non-Hispanic White infants in South Carolina in 2021 — is growing worse. The death rate among infants born to Black mothers in the state increased by nearly 40 percent from 2017 to 2021.  “That’s just not acceptable,” said Edward Simmer, director of the South Carolina health department. “It’s absolutely an urgent problem to me.”  It’s a problem, though, without an apparent solution. Multimillion-dollar programs to improve South Carolina’s numbers over the past decade have failed to move the needle. To make things more complicated, separate state agencies have reached different conclusions about the leading cause of infant death.  The state Department of Health and Human Services — which administers Medicaid, the health coverage program for low-income residents, and pays for more than half of all births in South Carolina — claims accidental deaths were the No. 1 reason babies covered by Medicaid died from 2016 to 2021, according to Medicaid spokesperson Jeff Leieritz.  But the state health department, where all infant death data is housed, reported birth defects as the top cause for the past several years. Accidental deaths ranked fifth among all causes in 2021, according to the 2021 health department report. All but one of those accidental infant deaths were attributed to suffocation or strangulation in bed.  Meanwhile, infant mortality is a topic that continues to get little, if any, attention, especially in the South.  A group called the South Carolina Birth Outcomes Initiative meets regularly to talk strategy, but this consortium of the state’s top doctors, nurses, health insurers and hospital leaders can’t solve fundamental problems, like teaching parents safe sleep habits or connecting all pregnant women to basic prenatal care. According to the Medicaid agency, nearly half of Medicaid-enrolled babies who died before their 1st birthday in 2021 were born to mothers who received no prenatal care.  “There’s good work going on. It’s just in little patches. It’s just not spread out enough to change our overall numbers,” said Rick Foster, a retired physician and former chairman of one of the Birth Outcomes Initiative’s working groups.  Expanding access to maternal care  South Carolina and several other states recently extended postpartum Medicaid coverage for women who give birth, which means their coverage remains in place for one year after delivery. Historically, Medicaid coverage was cut off 60 days after having a baby.  Some experts believe expanding Medicaid coverage to single, working adults who aren’t pregnant and don’t have children — something most Southern states have failed to do — would also help curtail infant deaths. A woman who is healthy when heading into pregnancy is more likely to give birth to a healthy baby because the health of the mother correlates to the health of the infant. But many women don’t qualify for Medicaid coverage until they become pregnant.  Even when they become pregnant and are newly eligible for Medicaid, it isn’t unusual for women in South Carolina to put off seeing a doctor until the third trimester, physicians told KFF Health News. These women can’t afford to take time off work, can’t find child care or don’t have a car, among other reasons.  Telehealth could improve access if the state’s broadband network were better, said Simmer, the state health department director. The department could also invest in a fleet of mobile vans that provide prenatal care. Each costs just under $1 million, he said. Ultimately, South Carolina needs more doctors willing to practice in rural areas. Fourteen of its 46 counties lack a single OB-GYN, Simmer said.  “We don’t have providers where we need them,” he said. To that end, he added, the state might consider using student loan forgiveness programs as an incentive for new medical school graduates to practice in rural areas of the state, where obstetricians are scarce. Meanwhile, two programs aimed at improving infant mortality in South Carolina, which were backed by millions of dollars in public and private funding over the past decade, were unsuccessful in hitting the goal.  The Nurse-Family Partnership, for example, which pairs expectant South Carolina mothers with nurses for at-home visits, didn’t have a statistically significant effect on birth outcomes, according to an analysis of the multiyear project, published by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.  CenteringPregnancy, a separate program that offers small-group prenatal education to pregnant women, also failed to improve birth outcomes, said Amy Crockett, a maternal-fetal specialist in Greenville and one of the lead investigators for the state initiative.  Crockett said she recently returned about $300,000 in grant funding to the Duke Endowment, a nonprofit that funds health, faith and education initiatives in the Carolinas, because the evidence to support ongoing CenteringPregnancy projects simply wasn’t there.  “It’s not the silver bullet we thought it would be,” Crockett said. “It’s time to move on.”  Birth outcomes experts agreed that racism and poverty lie at the heart of this difficult problem, which disproportionately threatens Black infants and mothers in the rural South. Research shows that White doctors are often prejudiced against Black patients and minimize their concerns and pain.  In South Carolina, the maternal mortality rate increased by nearly 10 percent from 2018 to 2019, according to the latest data, which found that the risk of pregnancy-related death for Black mothers was 67 percent higher than for White mothers. Upon review, the state health department determined 80 percent of those pregnancy-related deaths were preventable.  Disparities related to both infant and maternal deaths deserve urgent attention from both the federal and state governments, said Scott Sullivan, division chief of maternal-fetal medicine at Inova Health System in Northern Virginia. Hospitals also bear a huge responsibility as doctors and health care providers must learn how to fairly and adequately take care of Black women and children.  “The idea that we’re going to solve 400 years of racism in an hour’s worth of bias training is a cruel joke. Systems have to remodel their approach,” Sullivan said. “It’s going to take funding, and it’s going to take a sustained effort.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb3N0YW5kY291cmllci5jb20vaGVhbHRoL2Etc3RyaWtpbmctZ2FwLWJldHdlZW4tZGVhdGhzLW9mLWJsYWNrLWFuZC13aGl0ZS1iYWJpZXMtcGxhZ3Vlcy10aGUtc291dGgvYXJ0aWNsZV9jODYxNzM4Mi1mNGQ4LTExZWQtOThkNC05N2ZlM2E5YWViMWMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"birth","2023-02-04","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T14:19:02","Step by step, door to door, district by district, Hamlin Fistula Ethiopia’s new Project Zero aims to find and treat every woman living with obstetric fistula in Ethiopia. It is an ambitious yet achievable goal, writes Carolyn Hardy, CEO of Catherine Hamlin Fistula Foundation.  For 27 years, Abebech* hid herself from the world.  Her obstructed labour, at home and without medical assistance, lasted five days and resulted in a lifetime of loss. Abebech suffered the grief of her child being stillborn, and her birth injuries left her with lasting physical and emotional pain.  Leaking urine and shunned by her local community, she said: “I was afraid to go outside. My neighbours covered their noses when I went out.”  She withdrew from society completely. For decades.  The Hamlin Model of Care  Abebech was eventually discovered by a Hamlin patient identification officer. She was brought to the Hamlin Fistula Hospital in Yirgalem and her obstetric fistula was repaired with surgery. Our world-renowned Hamlin Model of Care supported Abebech as she began to heal from the psychological wounds caused by her birth injuries and years of social isolation.  Dr Catherine Hamlin developed the Hamlin Model of Care and it remains core to the organisation today. It considers the whole woman with respect and compassion, treating the physical, psychological and emotional effects of fistula. In addition to surgery, the Hamlin Model of Care includes physiotherapy, nutrition, counselling, vocational training, and support for reintegration back into the community.  Today, Abebech’s health, dignity and confidence have been restored. She no longer needs to hide from public view.  While obstetric fistula is rare in Australia, women in Ethiopia like Abebech continue to have their lives devastated by this birth injury, even though it is both preventable and treatable.  The progress achieved so far  Thanks to the pioneering work of Drs Reg and Catherine Hamlin, a cure is available. Together, they established Hamlin’s world-famous Addis Ababa Fistula Hospital, and Catherine went on to establish five more fistula hospitals in regional Ethiopia to ensure rural women had access to treatment and care.  Every year, Hamlin-trained midwives graduate from the Hamlin College of Midwives also founded by Dr Catherine Hamlin. As the health care system in Ethiopia has strengthened, the rate of birth injuries suffered by women is slowly reducing over time.  In 2016, the Ethiopian Ministry of Health estimated the rate of obstetric fistula was around 0.42% of all births (ie, around 15 500 obstetric fistula cases per year). Given the continued improvement in maternal health care, the Ministry of Health have constructed a statistical model that suggests that the annual rate reduced to 948 new cases by 2020.  Despite this progress, we have continued to face a significant challenge in eradicating fistula entirely. How do we find and treat women like Abebech, who are so often concealed behind closed doors? How can we ensure women, particularly those living in remote areas of the country, are aware that help is available?  Project Zero was launched on February 4 2023 (photo courtesy of hamlin.org.au)  Project Zero  To overcome these challenges, on 4 February this year, Hamlin Fistula Ethiopia launched Project Zero, a nationwide program that will accelerate the eradication of obstetric fistula across all regions of Ethiopia, step by step, woreda (district)by woreda.  With up to 1000 new obstetric fistula injuries occurring each year and an estimated 31 000 women living with historic untreated fistula injuries, the goal of Hamlin’s Project Zero is to reduce these numbers to zero. This is an ambitious program, but one we believe is achievable.  In a country of 118 million people, most of whom live in rural areas, ending fistula requires a systematic approach, and Project Zero has been designed with three fundamental parts: identification, prevention and education, and will be implemented woreda by woreda.  Identification  During the identification phase, Hamlin-trained Project Zero teams, made up of health workers and patient identification officers, will undertake community outreach and household surveys across the woreda. This will allow Hamlin to find women living with a historic fistula injury and transfer them to hospital for treatment.  Prevention  To reduce and prevent the number of birth injuries across the country, Hamlin’s Project Zero will expand the health care services available to women. Our goal is to establish at least one midwifery clinic in every woreda which does not yet have maternal health services.  Professionally trained midwives play a crucial role in reducing birth injuries. By identifying pregnancy complications, they can prevent obstetric fistula from occurring in the first place.  As part of Project Zero, Hamlin midwives and Hamlin-trained teams will also implement a comprehensive antenatal program to track pregnant women within each woreda to ensure they deliver their babies safely and birth injuries are prevented.  Education  Education is the third component of Project Zero. It is vital that women across Ethiopia have the knowledge and tools to give birth safely and understand that help is available should they suffer an injury during labour.  Our community education campaign will highlight the importance of seeking professional medical care during pregnancy, labour, and after birth. Additional training for existing health care professionals will also be rolled out across the country, so they have a deeper understanding of birth injuries and can advise patients of treatment options.  A fistula-free Ethiopia  The first pilot of Project Zero is now underway in Ale woreda in south-western Ethiopia. Hamlin staff are working alongside health professionals from the local government health bureau as well as other key stakeholders. The pilot is on track and we hope to declare Ale woreda as fistula-free by the end of 2023.  Key learnings from this pilot will inform Project Zero implementation in other woredas around the country. In each district, Hamlin teams will also provide longer term support to ensure that Project Zero interventions are embedded and that change is sustained.  Ending obstetric fistula is not just a maternal health issue but a human rights issue. On top of their physical injuries, women like Abebech face a lifetime of isolation, poverty and discrimination. This suffering is needless given that treatment is readily available in Ethiopia.  With Project Zero as our road map, Hamlin will ensure that all Ethiopian women living with obstetric fistula today are treated and given back their lives, and that we can minimise the risks of childbirth for the women of tomorrow.  Eradication of obstetric fistula is within reach. We are more determined than ever to make Dr Catherine Hamlin’s vision of a fistula-free Ethiopia a reality.  Carolyn Hardy has been Chief Executive Officer of the Catherine Hamlin Fistula Foundation since 2016. Prior to that she worked in senior leadership roles at UNICEF and UN Women.

McWilliams-Franklin, a six-time WNBA all-star who ranks first in franchise history in rebounding, had her No. 11 retired by the Sun on Sunday in an emotional postgame ceremony at Mohegan Sun Arena. (Jessica Hill/AP File Photo)  Mohegan — Taj McWilliams-Franklin gave birth to her daughter Maia on Jan. 15, 2003. Less than two weeks later, the WNBA franchise for which she played, the Orlando Miracle, announced its move to Mohegan Sun Arena as the Connecticut Sun.  McWilliams-Franklin jokes that since it was the days prior to a dependence on Instagram or Twitter, someone actually had to pick up a telephone and call to inform her of the news.  “Sadness,” McWilliams-Franklin said of her initial reaction. “It was a sadness because the team that we had started with all together was gone but also a hopefulness that the long-term solution was going to be something of strength.  “Just me with a six-month-old (at the time she arrived in Connecticut) and my husband who was in the military and couldn’t come so everything was like a shock to me. It’s kind of cold. I got off the plane in shorts because I lived in Texas. It was shocking and then it was like, ‘Hmmm.’ Everyone was so nice.”  One of the pillars of the Connecticut Sun franchise and its all-time leading rebounder, McWilliams-Franklin had her No. 11 raised to the rafters at Mohegan Sun following Sunday’s Connecticut victory over the Washington Mystics.  McWilliams-Franklin was hailed Sunday for her work, grit, class, toughness and grace by head coaches from both teams.  A postgame ceremony was then marked by words from Sun president Jennifer Rizzotti, former head coach Mike Thibault and McWilliams-Franklin’s former Sun teammate Lindsay Whalen. McWilliams-Franklin, who tearfully addressed the crowd, including her husband Reggie, was also bestowed gifts from the Mohegan Tribe.  “It’s an amazing day for me. It just feels surreal,” McWilliams-Franklin said prior to the game. “Seeing all the fans that were here from Day 1, it’s a little overwhelming to know that it’s been 20 years since we came to Connecticut and the fans, everyone has just been amazing and embraced us.”  McWilliams-Franklin, originally drafted by the Miracle in 1999, spent eight seasons with the franchise, sitting third in scoring, first in rebounding and second in blocked shots in team history. She was a member of Sun teams which made the WNBA Finals in 2004 and 2005.  A 6-foot-2 post player, McWilliams-Franklin played for seven franchises over her 14-year career, going on to win WNBA titles in 2008 with the Detroit Shock and in 2011 as a member of the Minnesota Lynx. She retired following the 2012 season at the age of 41.  McWilliams-Franklin is currently the WNBA’s Player Relations and Development Director.  Sun coach Stephanie White recalled Sunday that McWilliams-Franklin, or “Mama Taj,” as she became known, knocked her down during her rookie season in the WNBA, what White called a “welcome to the WNBA” moment.  “Taj is one of the all-time greats and not just one of the all-time great players but one of the all-time great people,” White said. “She’s ‘Mama Taj’ for a reason. She’s been around. She’s grown this game. She’s led young players in understanding not just what it means to be able to play in this league but what it takes to be a pro.  “She continues to lead by example. She continues to lead us all, really, in what this opportunity is that we have.”  McWilliams-Franklin said that at the time she was pregnant with Maia, it was so frowned upon to be a pregnant woman in the WNBA that the Miracle hid her pregnancy so she could retain her contract.  “You got cut when you were pregnant when I was in the W,” she said. “I lost my Nike contract, all of that. Now to celebrate women who are, for lack of a better term, kick-ass moms, too, and to put them in a position of being able to take care of their family and not being worried about losing their job ...  “Just knowing I was part of that movement and I’m being honored in this way has been sobering.”  Mystics head coach Eric Thibault was around the Sun growing up, when his father Mike was the Sun’s head coach. He described Sunday a McWilliams-Franklin that was especially effective in the clutch.  “She just had an unbelievable knack in her brain for the game,” Eric Thibault said. “She was fearless.”  v.fulkerson@theday.com","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRheS5jb20vc3BvcnRzLzIwMjMwNTIxL21jd2lsbGlhbXMtZnJhbmtsaW5zLW5vLTExLXJhaXNlZC10by10aGUtcmFmdGVycy1hdC1tb2hlZ2FuLXN1bi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"birth","2020-08-10","10:00:00","{""Marshalltown"", ""Iowa"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T05:19:04","Two authors arrived in Marshalltown on Friday, stopping at Stepping Stones Christian Bookstore for book signings.  John Bain of Wayland, and Ashley Beach of Denver, Colo., both had signings scheduled for 10 a.m. at the downtown Christian bookstore.  It was the first time both authors had ever been to Marshalltown.  Bain, 56, a retired 33-year veteran of broadcast news, brought the story of his daughter in “Christie’s Journey.” His first book, Bain said many people urged him to publish the story. At the age of 29, Christie experienced sudden cardiac arrest just two months after giving birth. She was at her place of employment and her coworkers acted quickly.  Christie received treatment at the hospital from the pediatric heart surgeon.  “They discovered she was born with a birth defect in her heart that we never knew about for 29 years. How does that happen,” Bain asked. “What usually happens is people who have this go into cardiac arrest in their teen years, and they don’t make it.”  Fortunately, Bain’s daughter is thriving today, and he was inspired to write the story.  “I would tell people, ‘God has a plan for us, and I am not smart enough to know what it is,'” he said. “At every event I have gone to, I have met people who have been in similar scenarios or situations or who just need someone to talk to, and this has been a great experience. We [Bain and his wife Andrea] didn’t pray harder to God for Christie to be well than anybody else. We realize that people pray just as hard for their loved ones and don’t get the outcome they want. We don’t have an answer for that, but we have to have faith in the Lord that there is a master plan. We need to keep that faith.”  Bain began writing the story in January 2020, and finished on Aug. 10, 2020 – the day the derecho swept through Marshalltown. The book was published in January 2021 and Bain has sold about 500 copies thus far. Copies can be purchased at Stepping Stones or various online retailers such as Amazon or Barnes & Noble.  On the other side of the walkway in Stepping Stones, Beach, 32, offered three books in her “Solstice Chronicles” series. She said they are similar to the type of Christian fiction as the “Chronicles of Narnia” by C.S. Lewis. Beach said her books do have a Jesus Christ-like character, and two characters similar to God and the devil. She said she took steps to weave the Christian aspects throughout.  “This is a faith-based fairytale series. So, each book takes place in a different season. The first [“Beauty Restored: A Winter Solstice Chronicle”] takes place in the winter realm. I based each one on different myths or fairy tales. The first one is based on the Snow Queen,” she said.  The second book, “Beauty Redeemed: A Spring Equinox” is based on the Greek myth of Hades and Persephone. The third book, “Beauty Reborn: A Summer Solstice,” deals a lot with the Greek mythical phoenix bird.  “The plot is the idea of beauty being lost, restored, redeemed, reborn, and finding beauty in ourselves and the world around us,” Beach said.

(Photo credit: Wikimedia Commons)  Pratap was one of the greatest exponents of the guerrilla mode of warfare in India, which inspired the subsequent rebels against the Mughals including Malik Ambar and Shivaji.  New Delhi: Maharana Pratap was one of the greatest rulers in the history of India. He is mostly remembered and lauded for his heroics against the Mughal Emperor which was helmed by Akbar during that time. His heroics and bravado during the Battle of Haldighati against the Mughal forces have become an immortal part of the country’s folklore over the centuries. Pratap was one of the greatest exponents of the guerrilla mode of warfare in India, which inspired the subsequent rebels against the Mughals including Malik Ambar and Shivaji. Today, on May 22, India is celebrating Maharana Pratap Jayanti, a day to commemorate the achievements of this legendary king.  Why is Maharana Pratap Jayanti celebrated today?  Maharana Pratap was born on May 9, 1540, as per the Julian calendar. But in the Gregorian calendar, Maharana Pratap’s birthdate was found to be on May 19, 1540. Irrespective of these dates, the birth anniversary of Maharana Pratap every year is celebrated as per the Hindu calendar which states that the great king was born in Tritiya, Jyeshtha, Shukla Paksha, 1597 in Vikram Samvat. Now, on the Western calendar, this day normally falls in late May or early June.  Also read: 17 districts of UP to witness heatwave for next 24 hours  Maharana Pratap and the Battle of Haldighati  The Battle of Haldighati is undoubtedly one of the most famous battles to have taken place in medieval India. Mughal Emperor Akbar was intent on conquering the powerful kingdom of Mewar, and that is why, he sent a massive army to subdue Pratap and his Rajput warriors. However, Pratap and his men put up a brave fight and although the Mughals defeated the Rajput army and inflicted heavy casualties on them, the victory turned out to be bittersweet for them.  The victory was partly successful for the Mughals, as they failed to kill or capture Pratap, or any of his close family members in Udaipur. On the other hand, the setback at Haldighati did little to hamper Pratap’s courage. He continued to fight the Mughals through guerrilla warfare, and by the time of his death, he had recovered most of his ancestral kingdom.  The legacy of Maharana Pratap  Maharana Pratap, Mewar’s Rajput king from the Sisodia dynasty who kept the Mughal Empire on its toes, is a popular folk hero in today’s age. He is revered for his courage, bravery, love for his motherland, ethics and honour and for lifelong resistance against the Mughal Empire. Today, his birth anniversary is celebrated every year as Maharana Pratap Jayanti on the third day of the Jyeshtha Shukla phase, the third month of the Hindu calendar.  Today, he is a prominent figure in both folk and contemporary Rajasthani culture. There and also in the rest of the country, he is a celebrated warrior and a legendary king. This year, the Tritiya Tithi begins at 12:39 pm on May 21 and ends at 1:48 pm on May 22.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzOWxpdmUuY29tL2tub3dsZWRnZS9tYWhhcmFuYS1wcmF0YXAtamF5YW50aS13aHktaXMtdGhlLWJpcnRoLWFubml2ZXJzYXJ5LW9mLXRoaXMtbGVnZW5kYXJ5LWtpbmctY2VsZWJyYXRlZC1vbi1tYXktMjItMjE0OTcyN9IBkAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzOWxpdmUuY29tL2tub3dsZWRnZS9tYWhhcmFuYS1wcmF0YXAtamF5YW50aS13aHktaXMtdGhlLWJpcnRoLWFubml2ZXJzYXJ5LW9mLXRoaXMtbGVnZW5kYXJ5LWtpbmctY2VsZWJyYXRlZC1vbi1tYXktMjItMjE0OTcyNy9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

At a two-day workshop on the operational kick off, Federal Commissioner of the NPC, Mrs. Bimbola Salu-Hundeyin, stressed the significance of understanding Nigeria’s demographics for effective governance. She highlighted the importance of accurate census data for informed decision-making at all levels of government.  According to her, every Nigerian child must have an identity through birth registration, which ensures their access to various benefits and opportunities.  She said: “The Commission aims to ensure that everyone in Nigeria is registered at birth, and must have a birth certificate because registration of birth is a primary identity. We are collaborating with UNICEF so that every child under 18 years must have a birth certificate issued under the authority of the NPC. But when you are over 18 years, you would be required to do attestation which attests your birth documents to ensure it is correct according to what you have presented to us.”  Child Protection Specialist at UNICEF, Dennis Onoise, who emphasised UNICEF’s collaboration with the government and civil society groups to promote birth registration, said the Fund has provided support through training and awareness programmes to encourage parents to register their children.  He noted that digitisation would facilitate mass registration efforts and improve accuracy, while challenges would be raising awareness and encouraging parents to register their children. He also urged the NPC to train stakeholders to adapt to the new system.  Director of Civil Registration and Vital Statistics at the NPC, Mathew Sunday, praised Lagos State for ‘performing relatively well when compared to other states’, but also emphasised the need for continuous improvement.  According to him, the NPC convened stakeholders, including local and international partners, to discuss strategies for increasing birth registration rates in Lagos.  He said: “The ultimate goal is to ensure that all children of registerable age are captured, promoting their rights and protecting them from exploitation. We want to get commitment from this group as to what can be done to move Lagos forward as regards registration of birth and death.  “Abuja is fully digitised, but the NPC aims to achieve full digitisation across all states by the end of the year, enabling improved services and efficient record-keeping.”  Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbmF0aW9ub25saW5lbmcubmV0L3BvcHVsYXRpb24tY29tbWlzc2lvbi11bmljZWYtcGFydG5lci1vbi1kaWdpdGFsLWJpcnRoLXJlZ2lzdHJhdGlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

He was clearly ahead of us in reflecting on several problems that dogged the received historiography of South Asia.He could demonstrate, through his own research and writing, ways of addressing these issues and had a vision of subaltern history that inspired us all. He also knew how to be a co-learner with us who were like his students. So being a ""guru"" did not necessarily mean any kind of oppressive hierarchy in our relationships. There was much friendship as well. Besides, he hand-picked the people he wanted to work with. None of us were formally his students. The only ingredient that bound us together was the excitement over the ideas that he had to share and his capacity to generate an intellectual conversation that created a sense of community among us. And because it was a group that was put together by him, it made you feel ""chosen."" He was special in that way. He did not much care for institutional conventions – this was not always well received by others – but this way he could build a sense of a group with a historiographic mission that had serious implications about how to understood modernity and the modern-political in the context of South Asia.  The covers of Ranajit Guha’s book  Amartya Sen said Guha was the most imaginative Indian historian of the twentieth century. Would you agree with him? Why?  He was original, imaginative, and brilliant, without a doubt. I would refrain from deciding if he was ""the best"" among his peers as that would once again take us back to another theme Sen has also elaborated on – the obsession with first-boys in the subcontinent. Originality was the hallmark of all of Guha's writings. A Rule of Property for Bengal insisted on and demonstrated the importance of ideas in colonial economic policy-making in India long before any other historian – with the sole and remarkable exception of Eric Stokes - turned to the subject. And you only have to read Stokes and Guha together to see the difference in Guha's approach. He was also the first historian in Indian history to seriously introduce ""structuralist"" ways of thinking. This gave us some very interesting means for thinking about that which, in India, seemed ""archaic"" in the very middle of the ""modern."" This he achieved during his Subaltern Studies days. His essays like ""The Prose of Counter-Insurgency,"" ""Chandra's Death"" are brilliant expositions of his thoughts on reading the archives and the necessarily episodic nature of ""subaltern"" histories. You may or may not agree with his conclusions, but you would not be left in doubt of his creativity and brilliance. He was also a very gifted and self-conscious writer of prose in both English and Bengali.  The covers of Ranajit Guha’s book  How did he organise a group of young historians like you in forming the seminal Subaltern Studies group and what was his method of providing intellectual insight to those who were not his direct students?  As I said, he hand-picked people or they chose him. He started with two doctoral students at Sussex – David Arnold and David Hardiman – and two doctoral students at Oxford. The two Davids worked with Anthony Low who was later my supervisor as well in Canberra. The students from Oxford, Gyan Pandey and Shahid Amin, worked with Tapan Ray Chaudhuri for their doctoral degree. When I look back on this, I realise that this could not have been an easy situation for either Anthony and Tapanda but they were both temperamentally generous and intellectually secure enough to let their students draw inspiration from what Ranajitda had to offer. These four people formed the oldest nucleus of what became Subaltern Studies. By the time Partha Chatterjee, Gautam Bhadra, and I came into the group, its basic tenets had been worked out and given a form in writing. But we all found them exciting. The agenda for history-writing that the group had worked out and that Ranajitda had set down on paper acted as some kind of a manifesto for the group. It was also new and inspiring.  Content of the first volume of the Subaltern Studies  Why can his book Elementary Aspects of Peasant Insurgency be considered a groundbreaking work that laid the foundation for Subaltern Studies worldwide?  Well, even if it did not lay down a universal foundation for subaltern studies worldwide – that would not have been Guha's claim either, for he always spoke of ""convergences"" of agendas and aspirations of different historiographies. Guha breathed new life into the word ""subaltern"" and the concept of subaltern histories that were relatively independent of elite actions. But Elementary Aspects was undoubtedly a novel work. It was truly heroic of Guha to examine closely the histories of more than a hundred peasant rebellions in nineteenth-century India and then build up a model for understanding patterns in collective rebellious behaviour of peasants, and to develop some deep insights into the insurgent consciousness that, Guha argued, underlay such behaviour.  How do you perceive the philosophical trajectory in Guha's thought, which encompassed Tagore to Hegel or the Indian tradition with modern European thought?  Guha thought of the discipline of history in the subcontinent as something that could not be separated, in its intellectual origins, from the history of the colonial state. For, colonial officials of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries wrote modern ""histories"" as part of administrative documents. Disciplinary history, for Guha, was thus what some might today call ""colonial knowledge."" It was part of the discourse of the colonial state and could never be separated from statist concerns. He found Hegel to be the philosopher of such a statist idea of history, and he wanted to oppose to that tradition Tagore's thoughts on human pasts, thoughts that always saw the modern state as something profoundly alien to the spirit of ""Indian"" society.  Why has colonialism been his primary area of interest for a long time? Why did he shift his focus from Gandhi to peasants in order to gain a deeper understanding of them?  This has something to do with certain facts of his life: he grew up in the last twenty-five years of colonial rule, came under the influence of the Communist Party, understood the predicament of his own class, Bengali landlords and the bhadrolok generally, as being a result of colonial rules and policies. Gandhi interested him deeply – how could he not, it was Gandhi who connected the nationalisms of the urban and upper classes in India with the worlds of the peasantry. In fact, the last class Guha ever taught, as a visiting professor at the University of California at Santa Cruz, was on Gandhi. He also would have retained a long-term interest in peasant movements, given the history of Bengal in the 1940s. But the interest in writing about peasant insurgency probably arose out of his interactions with young Naxalites of Delhi in 1970 when he and his wife spent a year in the country on sabbatical leave.  Ranajit Guha (right) with his wife Mechthild in 2008. (Photo: Professor Nonica Datta).  Which were his other areas of interest besides history?  Philosophies of history and language. Also, philosophies of Sanskrit grammar, theories of enjoyment in Sanskrit (rasatattva), Tagore, Bengali poetry and literature in general.  How do you assess his later works, written in Bengali from Vienna, concerning literature and philosophy?  I cannot provide a thorough evaluation since I have yet to read them carefully. However, based on what I have seen, his works are filled with stimulating thoughts and questions.  What was Guha's opinion on the idea and formation of Hindutva in India?  Like many others, he would have been opposed to it, and opposed to their attempts at distorting history.  What was Guha's perspective on the partition of Bengal in 1947?  Never discussed this specifically. He was unsentimental about it and seemed to have accepted it as a fact of life. But when I visited him in March this year, I asked him if he thought of his early days in Barisal in these final years of his life. He said, ""a lot. I think of my childhood days in Barisal all the time.""  Do you believe that the extensive discussions about Guha's legacies following his passing will reignite a debate on historiography or the approach to writing history in South Asia?  I hope it does. That would be the best outcome. Among all the tributes, however, there has already been a piece that I thought was particularly ungenerous, intellectually speaking. But that's how often South Asian academics argue, by putting people down, by dismissing their contributions, by ridiculing them. Maybe all this will eventually give rise to a debate that can elevate itself above the rhetoric of insults.  Having known Ranajit Guha for nearly five decades and being one of his close associates, considering Guha's life, what advice would you give to young historians?  That is a tough one. Best not to give any advice. An intellectual biography of Guha, if ever written, will make for a fascinating story of one very gifted Bengali-Indian intellectual and historian, living in self-exile for the majority part of his life but forever focused on the country he chose to leave, trying to make historical sense of life and politics as he had seen them. Perhaps others will draw their own lessons – not just academic lessons but lessons for life - from the substantial number of writings he has left behind. For at the end of the day, Guha was as much an intellectual and thinker as he was a historian. I think it would be wrong to reduce him simply to that last category. He looked upon History, the discipline, as a gateway to more general forms of thinking.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5c3Rhci5uZXQvb3Bpbmlvbi9mb2N1cy9uZXdzL2JpcnRoLWNlbnRlbmFyeS1yYW5haml0LWd1aGEtMzMyNjExMdIBWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5c3Rhci5uZXQvb3Bpbmlvbi9mb2N1cy9uZXdzL2JpcnRoLWNlbnRlbmFyeS1yYW5haml0LWd1aGEtMzMyNjExMT9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Laura Gene, 36, told Insider she fell into the community at a vulnerable time, when she was heavily pregnant and had made a long-distance move with her husband.  She described spending some five years as a dedicated follower of the movement, refusing to vaccinate her child and risking a dangerous home birth, before pulling away.  ""Crunchy"" is a catch-all term for a lifestyle that embraces a natural diet and remedies, often to the extreme, opting for pregnancies without medical intervention, home births, plastic-free toys, and prolonged breastfeeding.  Now Gene uses her TikTok account, where she has over 110,000 followers, to educate people about how easy it is to get sucked in like she did.  Gene found herself bang in the middle of a phenomenon that's come to be known as the ""crunchy to alt-right pipeline,"" where an appreciation for a macrobiotic diet and cloth diapers comes in tandem with political extremism.  And it was intolerance that shocked her into leaving, she said.  ""After five years, one of my friends went on this completely transphobic, homophobic rant,"" Gene told Insider. ""And after that, it was a very slow climb out of all things crunchy.""  She said that posting about her experience led her to many others in the same situation. ""We thought that we were totally alone,"" she said. ""We're just a dime a dozen really. There's a ton of us.""  Gene says she got into a crunchy lifestyle in 2015 through a yoga studio after making a major move with her husband.  She said she was struggling with her anxiety, worried she was going to ""screw up"" being a mom, and joined a prenatal yoga studio to help cope. Gene said though she still likes yoga quite a lot, this particular place ""just happened to be the wrong studio.""  Gene's life became more and more alternative  Slowly, Gene started getting sucked into ""alternative"" ways of life and never checking in with medical professionals — ""everything against the Western model,"" she said.  The studio became a ""one stop shop"" for everything, so she believed she didn't need to go for checkups at all. Instead she would visit alternative practitioners like chiropractors and naturopaths.  Crunchy lifestyles have a lot of provisions for new parents: some are harmless like ""baby wearing,"" which is carrying around your newborn in a chest sling.  Gene encountered more extreme beliefs too, such as being completely against vaccines, and the adoption of the ""sovereign citizen movement,"" where people reject the authority of the government, and parents refuse even to get their kids a birth certificate.  ""They're telling you, you can't trust white coats, doctors, you can't trust schools, you can't trust the government,"" Gene said. ""There are all these conspiracies, and when you start buying into one, it becomes really easy to buy into the others.""  Laura Gene and her baby. Laura Gene  Gene has a degree in psychology and considers herself a scientifically minded person.  But she ""still got totally caught up in it,"" she said, because of the supposed evidence the community would provide of the alleged benefits of diffusing essential oils around babies, drinking a smoothie with a portion of her placenta in it, or using coffee enemas to ""wipe out"" cancerous cells.  Gene said she resisted having a hospital birth, even though she was at risk because her son was in a breech position. After trying to do a home birth on the phone to a midwife, Gene ended up rushing to hospital where she said doctors saved her life and her baby's.  But, she said, this didn't make her question the beliefs. Rather, it made them stronger.  ""I was of the mindset that all breech babies could be born this way, here's proof, I did it,"" she wrote in an essay for Newsweek. ""I birthed my baby vaginally and any doctor who performs a C-section is robbing a mother of this beautiful experience, her 'divine femininity.'""  The community, Gene said, also started becoming obsessed with QAnon around the start of the coronavirus pandemic, a belief she said made no sense to her. One by one she saw her friends ""falling for it and posting these insane things"" about Trump and the elusive figure known as ""Q"".  During lockdown, everyone around Gene was saying the pandemic wasn't real, and it was part of a conspiracy to keep them locked inside the house, control them with microchips, or to cover up the arrival of aliens.  ""It really did sound to me like a lot of my friends were having collective mental breakdowns,"" Gene said.  Everything started falling apart after the first vaccine  The anti-trans rant from a friend coincided with Gene and her husband deciding to vaccine their son, then 4 years old, ahead of sending him to public school.  After making that call she also questioned other beliefs, in particular wondering whether using essential oils on her son could have worsened his eczema rather than helping it.  ""Everything just fell apart one by one,"" she said.  Now, three years later, she can't imagine how she believed any of it.  Laura Gene, who is now a mother of two. Laura Gene  Getting out of an extreme lifestyle might seem victorious and liberating, but it was actually that ""darkest time"" in Gene's life, she said. She questioned every decision she made, wondering if she was crazy for being an anti-vaxxer, or the opposite.  ""Like, which is the right thing?"" she said. ""What am I doing? Am I poisoning my kids?""  Her crunchy friends also starting freezing her out — banning their kids from playing with hers in case it ""shed the vaccine particles onto their children.""  People were telling her she was ""brainwashed"" and she was falling into the hands of the government.  ""People still tell me that today,"" she said. ""And as far away from the crunchy lifestyle as I am, my brain pings for a second, and I'm like, am I still doing the right thing or am I brainwashed?""  Gene has found a new community on TikTok  Gene is also still disconnected from the people she knew before she became crunchy, because she thinks they don't believe she's really changed. This is why her therapist suggested starting a TikTok account.  Thanks to sharing her story, people often get in touch with Gene telling her they've had a change of heart when it comes to vaccines and modern medicine. This shows no matter how far someone is down a dark path, she said, they can always return.  ""The best is when somebody is really very, very crunchy and they do not believe any of the information that I'm saying,"" she said. ""Then a few months later they're like, yeah, I just got my kids vaccinated.""  Gene said she doesn't believe that every natural therapy is somehow evil and will lead to conspiracy theories. People can favor essential oils while also sending their children to school, because it is a ""spectrum,"" she said.  ""If you want to consider yourself a crunchy mama still, go ahead,"" she said. ""You can still do that and also vaccinate your kids.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc2lkZXIuY29tL3Rpa3Rvay1tb20tdGVsbHMtaGVyLXN0b3J5LW9mLWFiYW5kb25pbmctY3J1bmNoeS1saWZlc3R5bGUtMjAyMy010gFdaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5zaWRlci5jb20vdGlrdG9rLW1vbS10ZWxscy1oZXItc3Rvcnktb2YtYWJhbmRvbmluZy1jcnVuY2h5LWxpZmVzdHlsZS0yMDIzLTU_YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

If you listen to the critical reception, Molnar “paints an honest, frightening and claustrophobic picture of new motherhood” (New York Times). The book gives “a fuller and more nuanced picture of the experience of new motherhood, which doesn’t always live up to the insistently rosy portrait we have of it” (The Atlantic).  But when Molnar’s protagonist struggles to leave her apartment at all and finds herself googling “How common is wanting to kill your baby?” is this really a depiction of motherhood in general, and is this the portrait that we want to paint for new and future moms?  The Nursery is a quick read, but it feels much heavier than its 184-page length. At the start, anyone who has ever borne a child will relate to its contents: from the incisive description of the simple process of using the restroom (now involving mesh underwear, squirt bottles, and instructions to pat, not wipe), the pain and the constancy of nursing, and the brain fog that reduces your vocabulary to that of a first grader.  Molnar’s unnamed protagonist has just had her first child (“a leech, let’s call her Button”) with her husband, John. The child is more an object, or rather an obstacle, than a new member of the household. “When I’m able to put her aside, I move Button away from me like an item,” the protagonist muses.  Molnar’s tone may seem incredibly harsh to anyone who hasn’t been through the trenches of new parenthood; to those of us who have, only slightly so. But as much as The Nursery has perhaps the rawest descriptions of new motherhood ever put to paper, and I found myself relating to so much of it, it also left me feeling hopeless—in fact, even more hopeless than I ever felt in my own early postpartum days.  A woman who has just given birth even under the best of circumstances is bound to feel battered. But she should feel more like a soldier returning victorious from war.  Because while I at least had the comfort of a tiny, snuggly being to mitigate the intensity of the sleep deprivation, the enormous responsibility, and the perineal pain, The Nursery’s narrator has little positive to say about her newborn daughter—or about herself. After giving birth, she is “like what you see scattered along a highway, an item once of value. I was a can of soda, a sock, a half-smoked cigarette, a piece of gum, a headless toy, a pair of used underwear.”  A woman who has just given birth even under the best of circumstances is bound to feel battered. But she should feel more like a soldier returning victorious from war. She isn’t an item that is broken or used up; she is a champion whose stretch marks, stitches, or perennial tears are her battle scars.  Pace the glowing reviews of The Nursery—which I won’t besmirch by saying it’s a bad book, because I don’t think it is—this novel isn’t generally about motherhood, or postpartum, or what women experience when they meet their newborns. It’s about one woman’s specific experience of postpartum depression and anxiety. In fact, postpartum depression was “one of the main themes I wanted to explore in the book,” according to the author. Neither should we conflate Molnar with her narrator; this is a novel, not a memoir. And Molnar herself clearly found motherhood somewhat satisfying; she started writing the book in the throes of postpartum with Baby #1, and she finished it after giving birth to Baby #2.  Molnar does say, however, that “making the distinction between my craft and my real life was becoming impossible, but pulling the two apart would perhaps also hurt both worlds.”  While many women will find that the early postpartum days are some of the most harrowing of their lives—I certainly felt this way—I hope that most of us find the extremeness of Molnar’s protagonist’s experience to be alien.  After page upon page of the protagonist’s bemoaning her loss off identity, googling terms like “postpartum anxiety” and “postpartum OCD,” and imagining herself smothering her child or chucking her out the window, the novel ends on a literal light note, as our antiheroine finally joins her husband and infant in stepping outside the apartment: “The golden hour reflects off our skin and I am reminded: it is my favorite time of the day.”  While many women will find that the early postpartum days are some of the most harrowing of their lives—I certainly felt this way—I hope that most of us find the extremeness of Molnar’s protagonist’s experience to be alien. There is certainly nothing wrong with an author’s exploring the darkness of the human mind, and, in fact, some of the greatest literature has come from it. But I do worry that some may see The Nursery as indicative of motherhood in general—and find themselves scared away.  In the conclusion of the New York Times’ review of The Nursery, author Claire Dederer muses, “As I considered the sheer ordinariness of the narrator’s circumstance, I began to wonder: Is this the tale of something diagnosable, something we put in a file named ‘postpartum depression’? Or is it simply an honest rendering of a transformation that would make all of us unrecognizable to ourselves, if only we sat with the truth, as Molnar has done here?”  If anything, however, Molnar’s protagonist exists in extraordinary circumstances, ones that have social and political implications for a society that wants to support new mothers. The protagonist’s mother died when she was young; she lives in a big city with her husband and has no support network. When a handful of visitors drop by after the birth, they are described as “mostly from John’s world,” and some she knows from her work.  She spends her days in isolation—save for a widower upstairs whose random visits become her lifeline—as her husband immediately returns to work after the birth. From this, we can draw social imperatives; the protagonist’s experiences would have been vastly different with a large and supportive community network, such as one found through church or neighbors. This has policy (or at the very least, private sector) implications, too: John has no prolonged paternity leave, meaning that when he goes back to work shortly after the baby’s birth, she and her mother are left with no help.  When I gave birth to my first child last year, my parents stayed in town for two weeks. My husband, thanks to his government job, took three months of paternity leave, cooking and tidying while I was healing from second-degree tears and stuck in contact naps. We were blessed with a community of friends, church members, and neighbors who delivered meals and offered other forms of support. Who knows what my mental state would have been if I hadn’t had so much help in the beginning?  Had I read The Nursery a year and a half ago, before I bore my son, it would have filled me with terror. Reading it now (during 1.5-hour spurts while my toddler napped), I found it merely melancholy, and somehow the protagonist’s descriptions of her baby’s helplessness and neediness made me nostalgic for that physical closeness that only exists between a mother and her child during those first few months of life. I wouldn’t recommend The Nursery to anyone who has not yet had a child but plans to.  “It seems like every literary or journalistic depiction of motherhood these days is dark . . . and somehow always elicits ample praise for being brave and truth-telling,” tweeted writer Elizabeth Nolan Brown in response to the Times’ review of the book. “I’m all for society sugarcoating motherhood & parenthood less, but . . . it feels like we’ve slipped into a weird pathology in certain circles where all people do is warn about how miserable it is & the only accounts accepted as truths are litanies of never-ending hate & terror & pain.”  Yes, giving birth to a child will leave you sleep-deprived and emotional and physically scarred. That’s only half of the story.  The National Marriage Project’s Brad Wilcox agreed, adding that despite the popular narratives, mothers are, empirically, doing pretty well: “You’d never know from most media accounts of contemporary motherhood that—on average—mothers are more satisfied [with] their lives than their childless peers,” he wrote.  As Alexandra Davis recently wrote for Public Discourse, “We don’t need to keep reminding women that motherhood is hard.”  If The Nursery is a tale of motherhood, it is only a half-truth. Yes, giving birth to a child will leave you sleep-deprived and emotional and physically scarred. That’s only half of the story. The other half is that you’ll wake up one morning and realize that your newborn is smiling at you (and no, it’s not just gas). You’ll feel him grasp your face and look deeply into your eyes. You’ll see her bring so much joy to your spouse. You’ll watch him fall asleep on your chest and know a contentment you didn’t think was possible. The lows are low. But the highs are so, so high.  “I think about how I am going to resent you once you arrive,” the protagonist muses before her child is born. “You will disrupt the peace. You will get in the way of my freedom.”  This is true. My husband and I joke that our energetic son has not known a moment’s peace in his entire life. I miss not having to plan my social life around a little one’s sleep schedule. The identity shift and the feelings that Molnar’s protagonist wrestles with are real. But so is the deep, deep love between a mother and child. And if our literature has been lacking in descriptions of diaper changes, it ought to tell the full story: that of the mundane, the ugly, and the beautiful.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXB1YmxpY2Rpc2NvdXJzZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS84ODcyMC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Each of the four siblings has their own unique reasons why they would excel in running the family business better than the others — OK, well maybe Connor’s not so much a part of all that. But one interesting element in this three-way sibling rivalry is that the Roys rarely ever pull rank based on age, like normal brothers and sisters usually do. It’s clear Kendall’s the eldest (not counting Connor), but Shiv and Roman’s ages are never explicitly stated in the show. That ambiguity has led to a debate among Succession fans — who’s older: Roman or Shiv? There is an official answer, but some fans will not have it.  There’s been speculation about Shiv and Roman’s birth order ever since Succession began, but the debate has reached a fever pitch in the show’s final season. A prominent fan theory has purported the two could be twins, as evidenced by their close bond, past comments Roman has made to Shiv, and Roman’s full name Romulus being a historical reference to a famous twin. But not everyone buys into that theory. To some fans, it’s obvious that the more mature Shiv is older than her childish brother. But they’d be in for a shock. According to Shiv’s official description on HBO’s website, she’s clearly described as “the youngest child in the Roy family.”  The revelation didn’t sway fans who are adamant that Shiv must be older than Roman, though. To them, it only makes sense for Shiv to be the middle child and Roman the youngest, no matter what the official birth order may be.  Apparently, even the Succession writers were a bit confused about which Roy was youngest at first. In a screenshot posted of the script book, a footnote reads that early episodes definitely seemed to imply that Roman was younger than Shiv, but the writers didn’t go in that direction since Sarah Snook is younger than Kieran Culkin.  Fans shared further proof in the show that Shiv is younger than Roman, including childhood photos in the background and some of Shiv’s overlooked “youngest child” behavior.  Still, although there is technically and official birth order, it has yet to be explicitly addressed on Succession at all. Hopefully, this Shiv-Roman debate will be put to bed in the final episodes of Succession, which air Sunday nights at 9 p.m. ET on HBO and HBO Max.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsaXRlZGFpbHkuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvaXMtcm9tYW4tb2xkZXItc2hpdi1zdWNjZXNzaW9uLWJpcnRoLW9yZGVyLWRlYmF0ZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

A few weeks before the 36-year-old welcomes her second child with her husband, Maksim Chmerkovskiy, she is figuring out her next move on how to care for her newborn properly and, by extension, allow her the grace to satisfy her intention of getting back to work as soon as she can.  Peta Murgatroyd Says She Is Returning To Work After Childbirth  En route to being a second-time mom, the “Dancing With the Star” pro dancer stopped by her Instagram Story to share a video explaining what she will do after delivering her baby boy.  The message started with the mother of one mentioning she intends to do things differently from her first pregnancy in the beginning stage because of the choice to go back to “work ASAP.” Murgatroyd said:  “I think you know this time around I’ll do it a little bit different[ly] in the beginning. You know I’m definitely looking to go back to work ASAP.”  The “DWTS” contestant proceeded with the kind of help she needed, saying, “It’s all about having the perfect amount of help.” She adds that it shouldn’t be much that you don’t know what to do with the person or too little where you’re still struggling to get stuff done during the day when left alone.  However, the “Faith, Hope & Love” actress, in the end, disclosed that due to her and Chmerkovskiy’s parents not living near her and her mother’s “green card” taking a long time, she is hiring a “full-time” nanny.  As it is, the New Zealand native loves to put extra thought into her future, and sometimes she gets very gloomy about it. The Blast recently noted that she got emotional about her toddler and soon-to-come newborn maturing out of their dependent years.  The “Burn the Floor” star shared a video on her Stories describing the level of void children leave around the home when they outgrow their toddling phase. Set to a cool piano tune, the video journeys viewers through how the bathroom gets used less often to how one can no longer find cluttered spaces, fridge handprints, or Lego toys lying on the floor.  Across the emotional post, the professional dancer expressed sadness over the inevitable change coming her way. She explained that though she pushes to keep her home clean and organized, she would surely miss the days she doesn’t have to as her children become grown-ups. Her caption read:  “This just made me weep… I’m always striving to have the cleanest house, nothing on the counters, toys perfectly placed on she, etc….but knowing this day will eventually come[,] my heart literally aches….I know I will miss the mess, the craziness…the utter mental/ physical exhaustion.”  The Ballroom Dancer Revealed Some Struggles She Is Facing During Pregnancy  Speaking of sharing raw and honest pregnancy details, this is not the first time the reality TV star has gotten honest with her fans. In March, The Blast reported that Murgatroyd was dealing with tiredness and weakness as her pregnancy progressed. In a series of Instagram updates, the pregnant mom talked about specific pregnancy struggles — one of which is exhaustion.  Looking visibly tired in the first post, Murgatroyd donned a gray cotton shirt with a write-up in front and let her hair loose while lying on the couch. She explained how she took her son, Shai, to school and then retired to the sofa, where she had been all day.  Later, the star opened up about the issues with her pregnancy, saying: “Tired, Exhausted, this week, I feel like I doubled in size. I feel like the baby is growing too much.” Ultimately, she expressed frustration about the difficulty of going back to sleep when she wakes because it is still dark outside.  In the following video, the TV personality continued saying, “My body just wants to sleep.” She further related a scenario where her body convinced her to rest more, but she nodded off. She then said:  “I feel I have to set my alarm for 6 to then snooze till 6:30, and then I’m maybe……I can wait up with a bit more vigor.”  The doting mother finally revealed she would “push through” despite being tired throughout the week.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlYmxhc3QuY29tLzQ4OTI0OC9wZXRhLW11cmdhdHJveWQtZGVjbGFyZXMtaW50ZW50aW9uLW9mLWdvaW5nLWJhY2stdG8td29yay1hc2FwLWFmdGVyLWNoaWxkLWJpcnRoL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Pictures shared by news agency ANI showed chief minister Stalin leading the celebrations of his M Karunanidhi's birth anniversary on June 3, 2022. (ANI Photo)  One of the major events is likely to be a gathering of Opposition leaders in Tamil Nadu, a senior DMK leader familiar with the matter said. “We will be inviting party leaders from across India... But, we are yet to decide who we will be inviting. It will be a gala event like one of our major conferences,” the leader added.  The party is also considering inviting Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar to inaugurate “Kalaignar Kottam”, a memorial built at Karunanidhi’s hometown in Tiruvarur, Tamil Nadu, the leader said.  The decisions were among several resolutions passed during a high-level DMK committee meeting, led by party head and Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin, on Sunday to celebrate Karunanidhi’s 100th birth anniversary for a year, starting on June 3.  The DMK has also formed a committee comprising senior leaders Kanimozhi Karunanidhi, Dayanidhi Maran, TKS Elangovan, A Raja, R S Bharathi and Trichy Siva to advise the party on the year-long celebrations.  On June 3, the DMK-led Secular Progressive Alliance will kickstart the celebrations in Chennai. “The meeting resolves to celebrate the centenary of Kalaignar (what Karunanidhi was popularly known as), the architect who built modern Tamil Nadu in an effective manner throughout the year,” the party said in a statement.  “Every district unit should conduct centenary celebrations until June 2024, highlighting the achievements of Kalaignar.”  The DMK earlier held a mega show of strength during Stalin’s birthday celebrations on March 1, with several opposition party leaders, including the Congress, Samajwadi Party and National Conference sharing the stage with Stalin.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kaWEtbmV3cy9vcHBvc2l0aW9uLXVuaXR5LXNob3ctb2Ytc3RyZW5ndGgta2FydW5hbmlkaGktYmlydGgtY2VudGVuYXJ5LXRhbWlsLW5hZHUtMTAxNjg0NzA4NTgxMjQ5Lmh0bWzSAYsBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaGluZHVzdGFudGltZXMuY29tL2luZGlhLW5ld3Mvb3Bwb3NpdGlvbi11bml0eS1zaG93LW9mLXN0cmVuZ3RoLWthcnVuYW5pZGhpLWJpcnRoLWNlbnRlbmFyeS10YW1pbC1uYWR1LTEwMTY4NDcwODU4MTI0OS1hbXAuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Rocking a classic tuxedo, the father of 7 cut a cool figure at the celeb-heavy event. The Taxi Driver icon held hands with Tiffany as they made their way through the crowded room.

The outing comes a week after the legendary actor was on the promotional trail for his latest movie, aptly titled About My Father, when he shared his thoughts on becoming a dad for the seventh time. “Sometimes, I don’t think people really know what being a good father is,” he told Access Hollywood on May 9. “Well, you know you have a responsibility but look, it’s a mystery, it’s a lot of excitement, but it’s scary and you do your best.”  A day before, the Oscar winner was asked if he was surprised about becoming a father again later in life, as he had welcomed his first biological child in 1976. Robert told Page Six that he was not surprised, adding “How could you not plan that kind of thing.”  The red carpet admission came only hours after Robert had dropped the secret baby bomb during an interview with ET Canada. When the reporter mentioned Robert’s “six” kids, the actor corrected the mistake. “Seven, actually. I just had a baby,” Robert explained.  Gia is now the youngest of the big De Niro brood.

It is not clear why she was asked or if that was standard practice at that hospital, BronxCare Health System, which did not respond to my questions.  While many hospitals routinely screen maternity patients verbally for drug use, a study published last month of nearly 40,000 births in Pennsylvania found that Black mothers were more likely to be drug tested than white mothers, even though white mothers were more likely to test positive.  The hospital said that Rivers smoked weed in her room; she denies it.  A.C.S. required her to attend parenting and anger management classes and take drug tests for three months after she gave birth. Did A.C.S. say the baby was harmed by the marijuana exposure?  According to her lawsuit, A.C.S. never alleged that T.W. was harmed. This is potentially significant, because A.C.S.’s policy on marijuana states that a positive marijuana test in a baby is not grounds for removal by itself — there needs to be a separate finding that the marijuana has caused “impairment or risk of impairment.” The suit also says that the hospital did not treat the baby for anything related to the marijuana exposure.  Was her baby taken away because she had had a prior child welfare case? What does the agency say?  It’s not clear. In Rivers’s earlier case seven years ago, she lost custody of her two older children for drug and alcohol use and failure to obtain medical care for her older son. But the suit notes that A.C.S. had already cleared her to get those older children back at the time T.W. was born in August 2021.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMjIvbnlyZWdpb24vYS1tb3RoZXItc21va2VkLXdlZWQtaGVyLWJhYnktd2FzLXB1dC1pbi1mb3N0ZXItY2FyZS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Around 30 lakh preterm babies were born in India in 2020, according to a new report titled “Born too soon: Decade of action on preterm birth” by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF). India is followed by Pakistan with 9.4 lakh babies getting born before the complete pregnancy.  Almost half (45 per cent) of all preterm births in 2020 occurred in just five countries: India, Pakistan, Nigeria, China and Ethiopia.  “An estimated 13.4 million babies were born preterm in 2020, meaning that 1 in 10 babies worldwide was ‘born too soon’,” reads the report.  Notably, preterm birth remains the fourth leading cause of loss of human capital worldwide at all ages.  The report also highlights climate change has further threatened women’s and adolescents’ access to high-quality health services that are essential for preventing and managing preterm birth.  Although the impacts of climate change are being felt in all areas of the world, the people most affected have contributed least to the crisis. The report reveals that around 91 per cent of deaths of preterm babies related to air pollution occur in low middle income countries.  “Climate change has harmful impacts during the perinatal period. It increases the risk of preterm birth by direct pathways such as air pollution caused by burning fossil fuels increases risk by 52 per cent in asthmatic mothers and extreme heat exposure increases risk by 16 per cent,” read the report.  The report further states household air pollution was an attributable factor for 15.6 per cent of all low-birth-weight babies and 35.7 per cent of all preterm births, notably in low-income countries.  ‘Born too soon’","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyaWJ1bmVpbmRpYS5jb20vbmV3cy9uYXRpb24vaGlnaGVzdC1wcmV0ZXJtLWJpcnRocy1pbi1pbmRpYS11bi1yZXBvcnQtNTEwMDEz0gFXaHR0cHM6Ly9tLnRyaWJ1bmVpbmRpYS5jb20vbmV3cy9uYXRpb24vaGlnaGVzdC1wcmV0ZXJtLWJpcnRocy1pbi1pbmRpYS11bi1yZXBvcnQtNTEwMDEz?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The 21-year-old New Dorp woman, Lucia Garcia, gave birth to the baby in the restroom of the entranceway area, according to the NYPD. Blood was discovered on her clothing.  The New Dorp Plaza resident was treated by staff and then taken into police custody, an NYPD spokesman said.  A source with knowledge of the investigation said Garcia complained of pain and lied about being pregnant to hospital staff. When the employees left the room, she gave birth and left the baby in a garbage can, the source said.  According to the New York Post, the woman is a migrant from Mexico who came to America approximately 10 months ago.  Garcia’s father, Ambrosio Garcia, 41, told the news outlet he had brought her to the hospital Friday night because she was ill, but she insisted she wasn’t pregnant. He told the Post he was relieved when hospital workers told him his grandson was doing well following the incident.  According to police, hospital staff tended to the infant before the baby was transported to NYU Langone Medical Center in Manhattan for further treatment and observation.  Garcia now faces charges of reckless endangerment and endangering the welfare of a child.

"birth","1960-05-09","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T23:01:48","The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is considering allowing birth control pills to be sold without a prescription. Some conservatives are raising predictable objections, but others appear to grasp the obvious: If the anti-abortion-rights movement truly is motivated solely by a desire to prevent abortions, without a broader agenda of imposing religious dogma or subjugating women, its adherents should be the loudest voices for making reliable birth control as easily accessible as possible.  The start of the sexual revolution is often pegged to a single date — May 9, 1960 — which is when the FDA approved sale of the prescription oral contraceptive Enovid, over fervent objections of religious leaders and political conservatives. The Pill, as society quickly dubbed it, was initially illegal in many states, and even where it could be sold, prescriptions were generally available only to married women.  The specter of separating sex from procreation was viewed by many as a harbinger of moral decay. In reality, it would usher in vast new opportunities for women to pursue personal and professional lives free of the ever-present threat of unplanned pregnancy.  After 63 years, the FDA is finally giving its first-ever consideration of approval for an over-the-counter birth control pill (the French-made Opill). It's late in coming by global standards. More than 100 countries already allow over-the-counter oral contraceptives.  America's continued prescription requirement is less the result of medical necessity than political trepidation. When a Supreme Court justice officially muses, as Clarence Thomas did in his concurring opinion in last year's reversal of Roe v. Wade, that perhaps contraception, too, should lose its constitutional protection, it's clear that at least some of the culture remains mired in the misogynist past.  But unlike the continuing debate over abortion rights, there are encouraging signs that the re-emergence of birth control pills in the national conversation won't spawn the same entrenchment from the right that it did generations ago. While a statement from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops ""strenuously"" opposing easier access to the pill was predictable enough, others who are fully engaged in the fight to end abortion rights appear to be sitting this one out.  The National Right to Life organization told the Washington Post it ""does not take a stance on anything that prevents fertilization."" Even as red states like Iowa and Indiana are passing draconian new abortion restrictions, they are simultaneously expanding birth control availability.  We would argue that abortion rights and easily accessible birth control share a common imperative: allowing women to make their own reproductive choices, free of governmental coercion in this most private of topics. But those who seek to end abortion rights should at least recognize their own special obligation to expand rather than close off other avenues of choice. To the extent that's happening, it's a bright spot in this otherwise darkening era for women.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9leHBhbmQtYWNjZXNzLXRvLWJpcnRoLWNvbnRyb2wtcGlsbHMvNjAwMjc2Njg1L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

""This is my favorite topic,"" =Lauren T. Roth, a professor of pediatrics at Einstein and a physician in the division of academic general pediatrics at the Children’s Hospital at Montefiore, said. The doctor has specialized knowledge of transgender medical interventions on children diagnosed with dysphoria.  ""Like, this is a normal thing. And we have to understand that gender is on a spectrum. There's not just men and women,"" she said. ""Sometimes [a child's gender identity] matches the chromosomes or the genitals that they were born with, but sometimes it doesn't.""  Roth also said children can have a nonbinary identity, or be genderless.  CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL DIRECTOR SAYS 'REVOLUTIONARY' SEX CHANGE CLINIC FOR KIDS IS THE SAME AS TREATING DIABETES  ""There's also a term non-binary, which means you're someone who doesn't necessarily identify with the categories of woman or man. You may identify as both as neither or somewhere in between on a gender spectrum,"" she said. ""And when we talk about younger children, we often use the term gender expansive. These children may not necessarily follow the social norms of gender.""  In June 2021, Dr. Roth said gender ideology must be adopted by parents ""at birth or even before,"" and proceeded to criticize the colors pink and blue for putting ""expectations"" on a baby.  PENTAGON DOCTOR CLAIMS PRESCRIBING TRANSGENDER DRUGS TO MINORS CAN CAUSE PSYCHOTIC ILLNESS TO 'MELT AWAY'  ""So it honestly starts at birth or even before,"" she said. ""I really think we need to try to stop making everything pink and blue [and also] avoid this huge gender reveal party.""  ""You know, it's okay to be excited when you find out that your baby's a specific sex. You know, people have dreams about what they want their families to be, but it's really important not to push all those expectations on your child.""  Dr. Roth went on to claim that babies can develop their gender identity as young as 18 months old.  ""Toddlers starts to notice physical differences and develop gender identity as early as 18 months to two years. They might begin talking about gender, playing dress up, having these established gender roles as early as age three or four.""  She also suggested parents can initiate gender-related conversations early in childhood in order to ""give them space to explore"" what gender they are.  ""If your child was assigned male at birth and one day they tell you, ‘I want to wear pink sparkly dress. Instead of saying what a lot of people say, ’Boys don't wear dresses, girls do.' How about you know, say something like, ‘Tell me more about why you want to wear a dress today.’""  ""You know be open and curious and just start the conversation. I really think having open conversations like that and just asking questions allows your child to share a little bit about themselves. And it shows that you support them, and it gives them that space to explore who they are.""  BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL DIRECTOR CALLS FOR DRASTIC INCREASE IN CAPACITY FOR GENDER SURGERIES FOR MINORS  On the national level, Dr. Roth serves as co-chair of the LGBTQ Health and Well-Being Special Interest Group of the Academic Pediatric Association, where she is working to bring standardized training to future pediatricians.  Dr. Roth, whose research includes a pediatrician's role in transgender medical interventions on children, has lectured at and hosted workshops for Einstein medical students and helped develop a ""culturally humble"" care curriculum for Montefiore residents relating to LGBTQ+ health.  Montefiore provides transgender medical interventions on children such as cross-sex hormones and puberty blockers, also called gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRHa), a class of drugs which suppresses sex hormones by continually stimulating the pituitary gland.  Proponents of puberty blockers argue that stopping the natural biological process of children can lead to better outcomes for transgender kids since it provides families with time to consider their options, and for a child to further explore their identity before progressing to permanent drugs such as cross-sex hormones and surgeries .  A recent research publication by top Swedish doctors called the hormones for children with gender dysphoria ""experimental."" They proceeded to sound the alarm of GnRHa's potential to permanently damage a child's full bone maturation.  Karolinska Institute's research systemic analysis of existing medical literature led to a conclusion that GnRH analogues were found to delay bone maturation and mineral deposits, which may not be fully restored even with the introduction of sex hormones.  There are also unknown effects on how GnRH will affect the brain of a child with gender dysphoria in the long term. Last year, the FDA identified six cases of children taking GnRH agonists, which presented ""a plausible association"" to causing increased pressure around the brain which can eventually lead the organ to swell.

One group in the Magic City hopes to get kids reading at an exceptionally young age.  Books for Babies is one of the longest running projects for the Billings Junior Woman's Club.  Woman's Club volunteers meet at least once or twice a year to pack over three thousand bags that contain infant appropriate reading material: like interactive touch and feel books.  The bags are then distributed throughout the year at St. Vincent and Billings Clinic, to ensure the books make their way into the hands of every new child born in Billings.  But there is a second part to the program that also helps new parents kick start their child's literacy journey.  Co-Parliamentarian for the B.J.W.C. Executive Board, Kristen Stewart explains how the project expands beyond the babies.  Stewart says that ""parents can access some reading materials not only for their child but also, they can have some information pamphlets for the local library and the reading programs supported through there as well as our club and any other necessary support for new parents.""  The bags also contain information on the importance and impact of reading to your children as early as possible.

"birth","2023-04-23","Not Discerned","{""NewOrleans"", ""Louisiana"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T21:17:00","SARAH MCCAMMON, HOST:  It took Larissa Adams and her husband a long time to get pregnant. And when she did, she had a miscarriage.  LARISSA ADAMS: And we thought that was going to be the end of it and that we would get pregnant again. And what ended up happening was that we spent the next four or five years getting pregnant regularly and then miscarriage after miscarriage after miscarriage.  MCCAMMON: Her doctors needed to intervene to complete each miscarriage. Adams would take mifepristone and misoprostol, the two drugs that are used together for miscarriage management and for abortions. After a number of miscarriages, Adams was able to conceive a single viable embryo through IVF.  ADAMS: By sheer luck - I don't know. I've always wondered. I'm like, are we the luckiest people in the world or have the worst luck? But it stuck, and now we have a 3-year-old, and she's totally healthy.  MCCAMMON: NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin and Becky Sullivan spoke to a number of people about why they took mifepristone. Some said mifepristone gave them a sense of control, like Michelle Brown, who found out she was pregnant while planning her wedding. She says she was a little bit panicked at first.  MICHELLE BROWN: But then, after doing more reading and thinking, we were - we then got pretty excited, actually, about the pregnancy. And then we found out that it was not working out.  MCCAMMON: Brown had started to miscarry. Her doctor had suggested waiting for the bleeding to begin. Brown was living in New Orleans at the time and working at a university about an hour away. Her commute took her across long bridges over swamps and lakes, areas where it would be hard to pull over.  BROWN: Every time I had to commute to and from my university, I just had all of this, like, dread, essentially, because I was, like, really afraid. Like, what if it happens now - right? - like, the cramping and the bleeding.  MCCAMMON: Brown went back to her doctor to get mifepristone and misoprostol and took them in the comfort of her home with her fiance by her side. Since then, they've married and they now have two kids.  Dawn - we're only using her first name because she fears family and professional repercussions - had an extremely complicated first pregnancy. She had severe preeclampsia, a condition with symptoms that include high blood pressure and can endanger both the mother and the fetus. Her daughter was born premature at 29 weeks and spent months in neonatal intensive care. Dawn ended up quitting her job.  DAWN: You know, I spent most of my time in that year, like, trying to keep her alive, taking her to different doctor and specialist appointments.  MCCAMMON: She learned that she was pregnant again when her daughter was less than a year old.  DAWN: I knew in that moment that it would be physically, emotionally, mentally, like, devastating.  MCCAMMON: It was an agonizing decision, but Dawn decided to get a medication abortion at Planned Parenthood.  DAWN: Honestly, I feel like it saved my life. I really feel that way.  MCCAMMON: These are just some of the stories of those who wrote to NPR giving their perspective on mifepristone. Mifepristone is at the center of a court case that could make its way to the Supreme Court, and here's why. Last November, a group of abortion-rights opponents sued the Food and Drug Administration, arguing that the FDA should never have approved the medication more than 20 years ago. And now they're seeking to take the drug off the market nationwide. The lawsuit also challenges recent rule changes from the FDA that have expanded access to mifepristone, including allowing abortion pills to be dispensed by mail.  Recently, attorneys gathered in New Orleans at the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals to argue the case. Here's Deputy Assistant Attorney General Sarah Harrington, who's representing the FDA. She took questions from Judge Cory Wilson about whether FDA's changes - the ones that made prescription mifepristone available through mail-order pharmacies - causes more problems. For instance, if someone's abortion is not complete after 14 days...  (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)  SARAH HARRINGTON: Those people will go back to their doctor and discuss with their doctor...  CORY WILSON: Not if they didn't get it from a doctor. I mean, the FDA's relaxed the requirement that the provider even be...  HARRINGTON: They'll go back to their provider and discuss with their provider...  WILSON: Nurse? Midwife?  HARRINGTON: Yes. And discuss with their provider the next step. But even in that small population...  WILSON: Mail-order pharmacy?  HARRINGTON: Mail-order pharmacy is not the prescriber.  MCCAMMON: The U.S. Supreme Court has put a hold on any changes to access to mifepristone for a period of time as the case plays out. So currently, the drug remains available in states where abortion is legal. This comes in the aftermath of the overturning of Roe v. Wade last year, and many people are worried about ongoing efforts to restrict abortion and other reproductive rights. Meanwhile, one U.S. senator is trying to make it easier for people to prevent unwanted pregnancies in the first place.  PATTY MURRAY: It is a health care decision. It is an economic decision for women, and women want and have the right to make this decision on their own.  MCCAMMON: That's Washington Senator Patty Murray. Birth control pills could soon be available over the counter after a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel recently recommended allowing them to be sold without a prescription. More than 100 countries allow access to birth control pills over the counter. The U.S. is not one of them. And Washington Senator Patty Murray says it's important that they not only be available but also affordable. When and if that day comes, Murray wants to require insurance companies to cover the pills free of charge. She introduced legislation to that effect a few days ago. Senator Murray joins us now. Welcome to the program.  MURRAY: Thank you. Good to talk to you all.  MCCAMMON: As you know, we are coming up on the one-year anniversary next month of the Supreme Court decision that overturned Roe v. Wade. Many states since then have implemented abortion bans, and there have been more proposed in recent months. How is that reality shaping the conversation around birth control?  MURRAY: Well, it's having a tremendous impact. Women in many states today, because of the decision by the Supreme Court, are really worried about their access to be able to have birth control pill as a way of making sure they don't become pregnant because in their states, they won't have access to abortion care. I disagree wholeheartedly with the Supreme Court decision. We need to make sure that over-the-counter birth control is available.  The FDA, which is the agency that approves drugs, now has an advisory board with 17 members that unanimously has said that birth control should be available over the counter. So you don't have to go to a doctor. You don't have to get a prescription. You can just go to your pharmacy and purchase it. They have to go before the full FDA, and we are awaiting that decision with bated breath. But because they had a 17-to-nothing advisory board, we are hopeful that will occur and occur soon. That is a great step forward for women today to be able to make their own health care choices.  MCCAMMON: Yeah. I want to break this down a little bit. You talked about the FDA process. So just remind us exactly where things stand right now with over-the-counter birth control.  MURRAY: Well, FDA has a process to approve drugs that go on the shelves in drugstores everywhere for all of us to purchase. And that standard is that it is safe and it has efficacy, meaning that if you take it, it's safe to take and that it works. So they have an advisory board that looks at any requests that come to them. And some of the birth control manufacturers have brought forward a proposal to have these over the counter. Their experts, their scientists, their researchers all look at this and do an in-depth decision and then vote on whether FDA should consider having it over the counter. That first step, the experts advisory panel, has now voted 17 to nothing that that should be available over the counter. The next step is FDA has to take it up as the full FDA, make that decision. And we are really hoping that that comes sometime by the end of this summer.  MCCAMMON: And help me understand a little bit more how your bill would work. I think a lot of people may assume that health insurance automatically covers birth control. The Affordable Care Act - Obamacare, as it's known - already requires many insurers - most insurers, really - to cover contraception. Why is your bill necessary?  MURRAY: Well, under the ACA, we said that insurance companies had to pay for all birth control for women without a co-pay so that women could afford it. Now that we are seeing that it may become available over the counter, we want to make sure that insurers still pay for it because it is costly, and it is part of your health care coverage. So it isn't just prescription only so that women can afford it.  Look, this is a great step if FDA approves this and women can go to the drugstore and purchase it without having to have a doctor's appointment or anything else. But it will only be available for some women if it is not covered by insurance. The cost can be prohibitive. So we're making sure that it falls within that category of this is what insurance companies have to pay.  MCCAMMON: We are seeing daily right now how difficult it is for Congress to make any headway on critical issues. Do you think this bill, quite frankly, has any chance of becoming law?  MURRAY: Well, I think we're all aware of what Congress is right now, and it will be an uphill battle. But if they follow the science and we listen to the FDA and we look at the decades of precedence and research, there really is no denying that the birth control pill is safe and it's effective. American people know that. They overwhelmingly support birth control being accessible and affordable, and I hope that Congress listens.  MCCAMMON: You have some Democratic co-sponsors for this legislation, but what are you hearing from your Republican colleagues? Are you sensing support for that argument that now, in a post-Roe v. Wade environment, is the time to make birth control more accessible?  MURRAY: Well, I would like to tell you that the rhetoric matches the reality of how many of these members of Congress are doing in terms of the post-Roe world and following the words that they say. So far, I'll just tell you the reality. We do not have any members - Republican members supporting this right now. So speak up. Speak out. Let them know. I don't think this is a partisan issue.  MCCAMMON: And just one last question. Why is access to birth control pills over the counter important when there are - you know, there are already other options like condoms that are available over the counter and many other options available through health care providers? What do you see as the impact of this kind of access?  MURRAY: Access for birth control, as every woman and most men understand, is extremely important for families, for women to be able to make the health care choices that work for them. It is a health care decision. It is an economic decision for women. And women want and have the right to make this decision on their own. That's why birth control is so important. It's why it's so important that it's easily accessible, and it's so important that it is affordable so all women, no matter where they live or how much money they have, affordability is not a deterrence for them to get the basic health care that they deserve.  MCCAMMON: Washington Senator Patty Murray, thank you so much for your time.  MURRAY: Thank you.

Aides said Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro (D-Las Vegas) held meetings at the Legislature in Carson City early Friday but checked into the hospital in Reno around midday and continued to work there, including conducting negotiations with Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo’s office late Friday afternoon. Cole Cannizzaro-Ring was born Saturday morning.  Cannizzaro is expected to return to the Legislature within a few days, and in the meantime, Assistant Majority Leader Sen. Roberta Lange (D-Las Vegas) will be in charge of business on the floor. The next major legislative deadline, second house passage, is this Friday, May 26.  The Legislature is in the middle of crunch time as it works through several high-profile policy matters, including a potential public funding package for a proposed baseball stadium in Las Vegas for the Oakland A’s and a major film tax credit initiative. Democratic leaders and Lombardo are also working through ongoing budget and policy tensions.  Nevada had the first female-majority Legislature in the U.S. and remains the only state with that distinction. Cole is the second child for Cannizzaro and her husband, Nate Ring. Cannizzaro was pregnant with her first, Case, during the last regular legislative session in 2021.  Cole had been due in June, but arrived several weeks early. Aides say he is expected to make an appearance on the floor of the Senate in the near future and accompany his mom for legislative business.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbmV2YWRhaW5kZXBlbmRlbnQuY29tL2FydGljbGUvdG9wLW5ldmFkYS1zZW5hdG9yLWdpdmVzLWJpcnRoLXRvLWJhYnktYm95LWR1cmluZy1sZWdpc2xhdGl2ZS1zZXNzaW9u0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Patty Murray pushes for over-the-counter birth control and insurance coverage  NPR's Sarah McCammon speaks with Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., about her efforts to push legislation that would make birth control available without a prescription and covered by insurance.  SARAH MCCAMMON, HOST:  It took Larissa Adams and her husband a long time to get pregnant. And when she did, she had a miscarriage.  LARISSA ADAMS: And we thought that was going to be the end of it and that we would get pregnant again. And what ended up happening was that we spent the next four or five years getting pregnant regularly and then miscarriage after miscarriage after miscarriage.  MCCAMMON: Her doctors needed to intervene to complete each miscarriage. Adams would take mifepristone and misoprostol, the two drugs that are used together for miscarriage management and for abortions. After a number of miscarriages, Adams was able to conceive a single viable embryo through IVF.  ADAMS: By sheer luck - I don't know. I've always wondered. I'm like, are we the luckiest people in the world or have the worst luck? But it stuck, and now we have a 3-year-old, and she's totally healthy.  MCCAMMON: NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin and Becky Sullivan spoke to a number of people about why they took mifepristone. Some said mifepristone gave them a sense of control, like Michelle Brown, who found out she was pregnant while planning her wedding. She says she was a little bit panicked at first.  MICHELLE BROWN: But then, after doing more reading and thinking, we were - we then got pretty excited, actually, about the pregnancy. And then we found out that it was not working out.  MCCAMMON: Brown had started to miscarry. Her doctor had suggested waiting for the bleeding to begin. Brown was living in New Orleans at the time and working at a university about an hour away. Her commute took her across long bridges over swamps and lakes, areas where it would be hard to pull over.  BROWN: Every time I had to commute to and from my university, I just had all of this, like, dread, essentially, because I was, like, really afraid. Like, what if it happens now - right? - like, the cramping and the bleeding.  MCCAMMON: Brown went back to her doctor to get mifepristone and misoprostol and took them in the comfort of her home with her fiance by her side. Since then, they've married and they now have two kids.  Dawn - we're only using her first name because she fears family and professional repercussions - had an extremely complicated first pregnancy. She had severe preeclampsia, a condition with symptoms that include high blood pressure and can endanger both the mother and the fetus. Her daughter was born premature at 29 weeks and spent months in neonatal intensive care. Dawn ended up quitting her job.  DAWN: You know, I spent most of my time in that year, like, trying to keep her alive, taking her to different doctor and specialist appointments.  MCCAMMON: She learned that she was pregnant again when her daughter was less than a year old.  DAWN: I knew in that moment that it would be physically, emotionally, mentally, like, devastating.  MCCAMMON: It was an agonizing decision, but Dawn decided to get a medication abortion at Planned Parenthood.  DAWN: Honestly, I feel like it saved my life. I really feel that way.  MCCAMMON: These are just some of the stories of those who wrote to NPR giving their perspective on mifepristone. Mifepristone is at the center of a court case that could make its way to the Supreme Court, and here's why. Last November, a group of abortion-rights opponents sued the Food and Drug Administration, arguing that the FDA should never have approved the medication more than 20 years ago. And now they're seeking to take the drug off the market nationwide. The lawsuit also challenges recent rule changes from the FDA that have expanded access to mifepristone, including allowing abortion pills to be dispensed by mail.  Recently, attorneys gathered in New Orleans at the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals to argue the case. Here's Deputy Assistant Attorney General Sarah Harrington, who's representing the FDA. She took questions from Judge Cory Wilson about whether FDA's changes - the ones that made prescription mifepristone available through mail-order pharmacies - causes more problems. For instance, if someone's abortion is not complete after 14 days...  (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)  SARAH HARRINGTON: Those people will go back to their doctor and discuss with their doctor...  CORY WILSON: Not if they didn't get it from a doctor. I mean, the FDA's relaxed the requirement that the provider even be...  HARRINGTON: They'll go back to their provider and discuss with their provider...  WILSON: Nurse? Midwife?  HARRINGTON: Yes. And discuss with their provider the next step. But even in that small population...  WILSON: Mail-order pharmacy?  HARRINGTON: Mail-order pharmacy is not the prescriber.  MCCAMMON: The U.S. Supreme Court has put a hold on any changes to access to mifepristone for a period of time as the case plays out. So currently, the drug remains available in states where abortion is legal. This comes in the aftermath of the overturning of Roe v. Wade last year, and many people are worried about ongoing efforts to restrict abortion and other reproductive rights. Meanwhile, one U.S. senator is trying to make it easier for people to prevent unwanted pregnancies in the first place.  PATTY MURRAY: It is a health care decision. It is an economic decision for women, and women want and have the right to make this decision on their own.  MCCAMMON: That's Washington Senator Patty Murray. Birth control pills could soon be available over the counter after a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel recently recommended allowing them to be sold without a prescription. More than 100 countries allow access to birth control pills over the counter. The U.S. is not one of them. And Washington Senator Patty Murray says it's important that they not only be available but also affordable. When and if that day comes, Murray wants to require insurance companies to cover the pills free of charge. She introduced legislation to that effect a few days ago. Senator Murray joins us now. Welcome to the program.  MURRAY: Thank you. Good to talk to you all.  MCCAMMON: As you know, we are coming up on the one-year anniversary next month of the Supreme Court decision that overturned Roe v. Wade. Many states since then have implemented abortion bans, and there have been more proposed in recent months. How is that reality shaping the conversation around birth control?  MURRAY: Well, it's having a tremendous impact. Women in many states today, because of the decision by the Supreme Court, are really worried about their access to be able to have birth control pill as a way of making sure they don't become pregnant because in their states, they won't have access to abortion care. I disagree wholeheartedly with the Supreme Court decision. We need to make sure that over-the-counter birth control is available.  The FDA, which is the agency that approves drugs, now has an advisory board with 17 members that unanimously has said that birth control should be available over the counter. So you don't have to go to a doctor. You don't have to get a prescription. You can just go to your pharmacy and purchase it. They have to go before the full FDA, and we are awaiting that decision with bated breath. But because they had a 17-to-nothing advisory board, we are hopeful that will occur and occur soon. That is a great step forward for women today to be able to make their own health care choices.  MCCAMMON: Yeah. I want to break this down a little bit. You talked about the FDA process. So just remind us exactly where things stand right now with over-the-counter birth control.  MURRAY: Well, FDA has a process to approve drugs that go on the shelves in drugstores everywhere for all of us to purchase. And that standard is that it is safe and it has efficacy, meaning that if you take it, it's safe to take and that it works. So they have an advisory board that looks at any requests that come to them. And some of the birth control manufacturers have brought forward a proposal to have these over the counter. Their experts, their scientists, their researchers all look at this and do an in-depth decision and then vote on whether FDA should consider having it over the counter. That first step, the experts advisory panel, has now voted 17 to nothing that that should be available over the counter. The next step is FDA has to take it up as the full FDA, make that decision. And we are really hoping that that comes sometime by the end of this summer.  MCCAMMON: And help me understand a little bit more how your bill would work. I think a lot of people may assume that health insurance automatically covers birth control. The Affordable Care Act - Obamacare, as it's known - already requires many insurers - most insurers, really - to cover contraception. Why is your bill necessary?  MURRAY: Well, under the ACA, we said that insurance companies had to pay for all birth control for women without a co-pay so that women could afford it. Now that we are seeing that it may become available over the counter, we want to make sure that insurers still pay for it because it is costly, and it is part of your health care coverage. So it isn't just prescription only so that women can afford it.  Look, this is a great step if FDA approves this and women can go to the drugstore and purchase it without having to have a doctor's appointment or anything else. But it will only be available for some women if it is not covered by insurance. The cost can be prohibitive. So we're making sure that it falls within that category of this is what insurance companies have to pay.  MCCAMMON: We are seeing daily right now how difficult it is for Congress to make any headway on critical issues. Do you think this bill, quite frankly, has any chance of becoming law?  MURRAY: Well, I think we're all aware of what Congress is right now, and it will be an uphill battle. But if they follow the science and we listen to the FDA and we look at the decades of precedence and research, there really is no denying that the birth control pill is safe and it's effective. American people know that. They overwhelmingly support birth control being accessible and affordable, and I hope that Congress listens.  MCCAMMON: You have some Democratic co-sponsors for this legislation, but what are you hearing from your Republican colleagues? Are you sensing support for that argument that now, in a post-Roe v. Wade environment, is the time to make birth control more accessible?  MURRAY: Well, I would like to tell you that the rhetoric matches the reality of how many of these members of Congress are doing in terms of the post-Roe world and following the words that they say. So far, I'll just tell you the reality. We do not have any members - Republican members supporting this right now. So speak up. Speak out. Let them know. I don't think this is a partisan issue.  MCCAMMON: And just one last question. Why is access to birth control pills over the counter important when there are - you know, there are already other options like condoms that are available over the counter and many other options available through health care providers? What do you see as the impact of this kind of access?  MURRAY: Access for birth control, as every woman and most men understand, is extremely important for families, for women to be able to make the health care choices that work for them. It is a health care decision. It is an economic decision for women. And women want and have the right to make this decision on their own. That's why birth control is so important. It's why it's so important that it's easily accessible, and it's so important that it is affordable so all women, no matter where they live or how much money they have, affordability is not a deterrence for them to get the basic health care that they deserve.  MCCAMMON: Washington Senator Patty Murray, thank you so much for your time.  MURRAY: Thank you.  (SOUNDBITE OF SLIPKNOT SONG, ""SNUFF"")  Copyright © 2023 NPR. All rights reserved.

"birth","2023-03-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T05:42:44","Effective street dog population management through birth control surgeries is the only humane, sustainable, and effective approach to controlling stray dog population.  —  IN March, the Union Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying rolled out the Animal Birth Control (ABC) Rules, 2023 for the management of street dog population, with provisions seeking to establish a uniform redressal mechanism for human–canine conflict. The Rules also provide for basic care such as food, water and vaccinations, towards reducing the risk of zoonoses.  Effective street dog population management through birth control surgeries is the only humane, sustainable and effective approach to controlling stray dog population. A robust immunisation protocol incorporated into the programme benefits not only dogs, but also the human population living in an area.  Several animal birth control programmes for street dogs have been implemented in different parts of the world, including effective programmes in Mexico and Chile. The program in India, which involves capturing street dogs, sterilising them, vaccinating them against rabies, and then releasing them back into their original location, has been successful in reducing the number of stray dogs in some cities and towns. The ABC programme has been mandated by law since 2001, yet its success is limited to a few areas. What, then, is the missing link?  Providing low-cost birth control ensures that stray dogs don’t reproduce. Additionally, sterilisation prevents sexually transmitted diseases, reduces the risk for communicable diseases, and improves overall health, especially in female dogs  The primary goal of such programmes is to control and manage the street dog population in a humane and effective manner, rather than eradicating it completely. History and experience tells us eliminating street dogs entirely is difficult, and misguided attempts to do so through the culling of dogs is not only cruel but also ineffective.  Also read: Stray dogs: From ‘ownerless’ to ‘community-owned’  ABC Rules, 2023  Most people who feed and care for street dogs don’t have access to veterinary care and resources to transport them. Instead, providing low-cost birth control ensures that these dogs don’t reproduce. Additionally, when considering individual animal welfare, it is pertinent to note that sterilisation prevents sexually transmitted diseases, reduces the risk of communicable diseases, and improves overall health, especially in female dogs  Successful animal birth control programmes for street dogs must involve a combination of sterilisation, vaccination and education. The ABC Rules, 2023 strive for street dog population management, with the added component of disease control. Gaps in terms of monitoring, community animal care-giving (community involvement), and the role of bodies or committees to ensure uniform implementation from the ABC (Dogs) Rules, 2001 are addressed in these Rules.  Sterilisation is a key component of the programme, and is a humane method for reducing the number of stray dogs in a given area over time. In addition to sterilisation, ABC programmes must include vaccination against rabies, which is a major concern in India. By preventing an increase in their population through humane sterilisation and immunisation efforts, we can help to reduce the incidence of dog bites and other public health risks associated with stray dogs.  However, without strategic planning and the data-driven approach needed to scale up the programme, its sporadic execution in select cities will continue to yield no results. There is a need to lay emphasis on stricter implementation and execution.  Also read: Allahabad HC puts in abeyance its direction seeking removal of stray dogs from city precincts  Multipronged approach  Several interventions must run parallel to the ABC programme. Intact pets that are allowed to roam freely or may have been abandoned mate with street dogs, contributing to the population. Laws that regulate breeding, and mandate responsible ownership, that is, the spaying or neutering and vaccination of pet animals, play a crucial role in this respect.  The Union government, in notifying the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Dog Breeding and Marketing) Rules, 2017 and through the ABC Rules, in classifying dogs (Rule 7 of the 2023 Rules) and allocating the responsibility of sterilisation of pets to their owners (Rule 8 of the 2023 Rules), has addressed these gaps. Combined with this, public awareness campaigns can help educate people about the importance of responsible pet ownership and the negative impacts of abandoning pets. These campaigns can also encourage people to report stray dogs to local animal control authorities.  Being kind to street dogs is not only the right thing to do, but it also benefits public health, community well-being and safety.  To remove dogs from streets and place them in homes, the Lucknow Municipal Corporation has issued policies to incentivise the adoption of street dogs. The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation is also attempting to promote adoption. Such adoption programmes, in collaboration with the efforts of ABC implementing agencies and rescue organisations to place street dogs with families who are willing to adopt them, will further reduce the number of stray dogs on the streets.  Costs  Imagine permanently confining street dogs in centres built for this purpose. Factor in the cost of developing and maintaining the infrastructure, catching dogs, and the care and maintenance of dogs, including food, water and veterinary care for 10–12 years.  Sterilisation and immunisation is a far more cost-effective approach to controlling the stray dog population than culling or relocation. It also reduces the need for expensive and time-consuming dog control measures in the long run.  Also read: Delhi HC lays down guidelines for feeding community dogs; says RWA, govt authorities duty bound to ensure food, water for them  Responsibility ultimately lies with all of us  The responsibility of ensuring animal welfare, public health and safety is squarely on our government. The ABC Rules create the impetus for resource development and implementation. Addressing the human–canine conflict requires sustained funding and effort from the government, organisations and local communities.  The policy has only just been amended, with the purpose to address gaps such as inconsistent execution, the lack of monitoring, funding, and ambiguity over allocation of responsibility. It cannot be expected to achieve its purpose overnight.  Being kind to street dogs is not only the right thing to do, but it also benefits public health, community well-being and safety. By treating street dogs with compassion and respect, we can create a more harmonious and humane society for all.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlbGVhZmxldC5pbi9hYmMtb2Ytc3RyZWV0LWRvZy1wb3B1bGF0aW9uLW1hbmFnZW1lbnQtcnVsZXMtYW5kLXRoZWlyLWVmZmVjdGl2ZS1pbXBsZW1lbnRhdGlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"birth","2022-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T14:56:48","Saturday, May 20, 2023  On May 3, 2023, Maryland Governor Wes Moore signed into law SB 828, which amends the state’s Family and Medical Leave Insurance Program (the “Program”) that was originally established in April 2022. As we previously reported, the Program generally provides eligible employees with 12 (but in some cases, 24) weeks of paid leave to be used for certain covered family and medical-related absences. The Program and SB 828’s amendments—which will take effect on June 1, 2023—are nuanced, so below are five significant updates from the new legislation for Maryland employers to consider.  1. Start Dates for Making Contributions and Using Leave Benefits  Contributions from employees and employers with 15 or more employees will continue to fund the Program under SB 828. While these required contributions were set to begin on October 1, 2023, SB 828 pushes back the start date by one year to October 1, 2024. As a result, SB 828 also modifies several other Program deadlines, including delaying the date when employees may begin using Program leave benefits from January 1, 2025 to January 1, 2026.  2. Total Contribution Rates and Employee/Employer Cost Split  SB 828 does not identify the total contribution rate that will apply on October 1, 2024, but it does require the Maryland Department of Labor (MD DOL) to do so by October 1, 2023, and provides that this initial contribution rate will be effective from October 1, 2024 to June 30, 2026. The MD DOL will determine subsequent contribution rates annually by February 1, which will be effective for 12 months beginning each July 1. Importantly, SB 828 caps the total rate of contribution at 1.2% of an employee’s wages.  Finally, SB 828 provides that employees and employers with 15 or more employees will split the cost of the total contribution rate 50/50; provided, however, that employers may choose to cover more than 50% of the total contribution rate if they provide certain advanced notice to employees. Under the original legislation, the MD DOL was to determine a cost split of anywhere between 25% and 75%.  3. Reasons for Leave  When the Program was first enacted, it established five family and medical-related reasons for which leave could be used, including time to care for a newborn child or a child newly placed for adoption, foster care, or kinship care within the first year of the birth, adoption, or placement (“New Child Leave”). SB 828 clarifies and expands when New Child Leave is available in several ways:  The child at issue must be the child of the employee seeking leave (either by birth or through placement).  For children to whom the employee gives birth, employees may now use New Child Leave to care or to bond with the child during the first year after the child’s birth.  For children who are placed with an employee through foster care, kinship care, or adoption, employees may now use New Child Leave during the placement process, as well as to care for and bond with the child during the first year after placement.  4. Interaction with Other Leave Laws  Leave taken pursuant to the Program will continue to run concurrently with leave available under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Additionally, SB 828 now permits the MD DOL to count leave taken under FMLA against an employee’s Program leave bank, even if the employee does not apply for benefits under the Program, if (i) the employer designates the leave as covered by FMLA and the employee qualifies for FMLA benefits; (ii) the employer informs the employee of their eligibility for benefits under the Program; and (iii) the employee declines to apply for Program benefits.  Additionally, while the original legislation required employees to exhaust other employer-provided paid leave before using Program leave benefits, SB 828 instead generally provides that employers may not require employees to use or exhaust paid vacation, sick leave, or other employer-provided time off before or while receiving Program leave benefits. However, if the leave benefits available under the Program do not cover 100% of the employee’s average weekly wages, SB 828 permits employees to use these other employer-provided leave benefits to make up the wage differential if they and the employer agree to such use.  5. Expanded Definitions  SB 828 adds or amends the definition of the three following terms:  The law defines “application year” based on when a covered individual’s benefits request is approved, rather than when the individual files an application for benefits. This term is used, among other things, to determine when an employee has exhausted available leave benefits.  “Family member,” which previously identified ten different familial relationships for which Program leave benefits may be available, is expanded to include domestic partners.  “Wages” is now a defined term and encompasses employees’ hourly wages or salaries, commissions, compensatory pay, severance pay, standby pay, tips and gratuities, holiday and vacation pay, and any other paid leave (including sick leave) that is paid to the employee entirely by the employer. This definition is particularly important as it relates to determining the total contribution rate, as well as the weekly benefits to which an employee may be entitled.  What Maryland Employers Should Do Now  Review and modify relevant leave policies to reflect SB 828’s changes to the Program, including the expanded definition of family member, permitted reasons for using New Child Leave, and coordination of Program leave benefits with other employer-provided paid leave benefits.  Ensure that human resources and payroll personnel, as well as payroll service providers, are aware of the Program’s implementation delay.  Continue to monitor the MD DOL for the release of relevant information, including the initial contribution rate that will apply on October 1, 2024, revised agency forms, and regulations.  ***  Alexandria Adkins, a Law Clerk – Admission Pending (not admitted to the practice of law) in the firm’s New York office, contributed to the preparation of this post.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdGxhd3Jldmlldy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9tYXJ5bGFuZC1kZWxheXMtaW1wbGVtZW50YXRpb24tc3RhdGUtcy1wYWlkLWZhbWlseS1hbmQtbWVkaWNhbC1sZWF2ZS1wcm9ncmFt0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmF0bGF3cmV2aWV3LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL21hcnlsYW5kLWRlbGF5cy1pbXBsZW1lbnRhdGlvbi1zdGF0ZS1zLXBhaWQtZmFtaWx5LWFuZC1tZWRpY2FsLWxlYXZlLXByb2dyYW0_YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"birth","1926-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Dublin"", ""Dublin"", ""Ireland""}","2023-05-20T00:50:00","The origin of the word “courage” is the French coeur, meaning “heart.” The life of Gershon Copperman is the story of the gift of courage, of the love and devotion of the heart, of a vision honored and carried from one generation to the next.  Copperman was born in Dublin, Ireland, in 1926, to Sarah and Avraham Simcha Copperman. He describes his father as an idealist, a Zionist, a visionary who paved the way for his family to make aliyah in the future. In 1935, his father traveled on his own by train and boat from Ireland to Israel and stayed with relatives in Herzliya for a few months. He bought a small plot of land to be used for agriculture and to become their future home. In 1940, however, Avraham Simcha died, and his dream of aliyah came to an end. Seven years later, in 1947, Copperman brought his father to Palestine to be buried on the Mount of Olives.  “I was 21 years old. I came by myself to bury my father. I remember I needed a British permit, and I toured Israel – the narrow alleys of the Kotel, the Tel Aviv promenade, and even the electricity facility on the border with Jordan. I visited Kever Rachel [Rachel’s Tomb], where someone took a photograph of me that I still treasure. I knew at that time that one day I would return to live in Israel.” Gershon Copperman  “I was 21 years old. I came by myself to bury my father. I remember I needed a British permit, and I toured Israel – the narrow alleys of the Kotel, the Tel Aviv promenade, and even the electricity facility on the border with Jordan. I visited Kever Rachel [Rachel’s Tomb], where someone took a photograph of me that I still treasure. I knew at that time that one day I would return to live in Israel,” says Copperman. “From 1948 until 1967, the family could not visit the gravesite that was in Jordanian territory.”  When his mother was left a young widow with six children, Copperman, the eldest at 14 years, honoring his mother, acted in loco parentis. He gave up school in order to work full time in the family clothing business to provide for his mother and five younger siblings. He helped to nurture and raise his brothers and sister, ensuring that they completed their education at the highest levels. He eventually sold the business to open a travel agency, the Charles S. Robinson Agency.  Through all of this, Copperman held steadfast to his father’s Zionist vision and guided his siblings in the direction of Israel. Ultimately, they all made aliyah.  WITH SONS Menachem and Aharon-David, celebrating his 96th birthday at the Kotel, and then over fish & chips and beer in Jerusalem’s Mahaneh Yehuda market. (credit: Copperman family)  A family's Zionist vision to make aliyah  Gershon’s brother Rabbi Dr. Yehuda Copperman, founder of the Michlalah Jerusalem College for Women, laid the foundation for an all-inclusive, comprehensive Torah education and academics for women. He dedicated some of his books to Gershon and often said, “Everything I have, I owe to you.”  Copperman’s son Rabbi Menachem Copperman, community leader and rabbi of Kehillat Ahavat Tzion Synagogue in Ramat Beit Shemesh, says, “Without my father, the family would not exist as it did and as it does.”  FROM AN early age, Copperman was a respected member of the Dublin Jewish community and personally connected with rabbis and dignitaries.  In 1971, he married Doris Neuer in Montreal. They met in Israel while both were visiting and began a correspondence and a long-distance romance. Cardiologist Dr. Yitzhak Copperman, his brother, recalls that one of the airlines so valued working with Gershon that they gave free return tickets to all his siblings to attend the joyful wedding.  “We had one Sheva Bracha in Montreal,” reminisces Copperman, “and then we traveled to Israel to celebrate the rest of the Sheva Brachot. Afterward, we went to live in Dublin, where our two sons, Menachem and Aharon-David, were born.”  In 1978, the four made aliyah.  “When I left Dublin to move to Israel, I left a lifetime behind – a good life, good times, good years. I left my home to go to my other home,” he says.  He recalls when a neighbor asked him why he was leaving Ireland, he explained, “I can’t give you one reason why I am leaving Ireland, but I can tell you why I am going to Israel.”  Adjustment to a new culture was not easy at the beginning, but Copperman and his wife shared an ideal – to be part of Israel. They chose to live in Petah Tikva to be close to Doris’s brother and sister-in-law. The couple became active members of the Anglo community of the Young Israel Synagogue, where Copperman attended classes. He also continued to work in a travel bureau in Bnei Brak.  Classical music fills Copperman’s life. In his youth, he played the violin, and he loves opera. He and Doris attended concerts and cultural events and often traveled to London to experience the theater.  Copperman describes Dublin and the Adelaide Road Synagogue that opened in 1892 in the center of the Jewish, Zionist community. He also talks about the illustrious Herzog family that lived nearby. Rabbi Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog was the first chief rabbi of Ireland (1921-1936), and then became the Ashkenazi chief rabbi of the British Mandate of Palestine, known as HaYishuv HaIvri. He continued as the first chief rabbi of the State of Israel until 1959.  When Rabbi Herzog left Dublin in 1936 for the Yishuv, Copperman, then 10 years old, gave a farewell speech in the synagogue.  The concept of time may be perceived as linear or circular. Today, closing a circle, adorning Kehillat Ahavat Tzion Synagogue in Beit Shemesh are the Aron Kodesh (Torah Ark), the pulpit and other klei kodesh (holy vessels), from the Adelaide Road Synagogue that Rabbi Herzog stood in front of, close to 100 years ago. And his grandson, President Isaac Herzog, then cabinet minister, spoke at the dedication in 2008.  ABOUT 40 years after he made aliyah, Copperman moved to Jerusalem in 2019, to Beit Tovei Ha’ir, a senior residence. Decorating the entrance to his apartment is the Irish blessing for a safe life journey:  May the road rise up to meet you  May the wind be always at your back  May the sun shine warm upon your face,  the rains fall soft upon your fields  And until we meet again,  May God hold you in the palm of His hand.  HIS FRIEND Morris Inker says that Copperman introduced him to the beauty and majesty of Jerusalem. He describes Copperman as a storyteller, eloquent and poetic. “He charms people with his wit and sense of humor.”  Copperman’s phone rings with calls. His apartment fills with company. He has a genuine interest in people. He says it is important for people to listen to each other, to hear the other side, to make way if necessary. When you meet with him, you are drawn in by his goodwill, his recognizing and acknowledging the good in people, and his feeling of gratitude for the beauty of life.  “My father taught us derech eretz kadma le’Torah – proper, ethical conduct between man and man, gemilut chasadim – acts of loving kindness, compassion, love. My father embodies the quality of humanity,” says Menachem.  Aharon-David recounts that when he was a young boy walking with his father, people around them assumed he was with his grandfather. He says, “My father was 50 years old when I was born. I feel like I keep my father eternally young. He has a young spirit.”  Sixteen years ago, Gershon and his sons went on a journey to Ireland, their native land. They visited the homes where they were born. In one house, Aharon-David remembers, they found the original wallpaper mural still decorating a wall. As if time stood still.  The fifth commandment resonates, “Honor your father and your mother, so that your days may be long in the land which the Lord, your God, gives you.”  “In fact, our father made sure to take care of his mother and bought an apartment for her in Bayit Vegan, Jerusalem, when she made aliyah in the 1970s,” Aharon-David says. “Later, in 1985, our family was surprised to find that right next to our grandfather’s grave was an empty single plot where our grandmother could be buried next to her husband.”  The rabbinic midrash infers that the fifth commandment may be extended to include a worthy older brother. In this way, Copperman is also honored and revered as a father by all his extended family.  In Dublin almost a century ago, Copperman’s father had a dream. In the future, his family left their place of birth, fulfilled this longing, and created a family in Israel.  With the fullness of his heart, Gershon Copperman actualized his father’s dream. ■  Gershon Copperman From Dublin to Jerusalem, 1978","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpwb3N0LmNvbS9hbGl5YWgvYXJ0aWNsZS03NDM1MTLSAS1odHRwczovL20uanBvc3QuY29tL2FsaXlhaC9hcnRpY2xlLTc0MzUxMi9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

On the third episode of the sixth season of Selling Sunset, the newest real estate agent, 32, was asked by her castmates about her relationship with Nick Cannon, 42, with whom she shares share 10-month-old son Legendary Love.  ""Obviously he's very busy too in his career, how does he spread himself like that?"" costar Heather Rae El Moussa asks Tiesi.  ""We know he's spreading himself,"" Tiesi laughs in response. ""But that's not what we're talking about.""  ""He's got a lot of stops to make,"" adds Amanza Smith, to which Tiesi jokes, ""Yeah, I mean girl, it's like Christmas, it's like Santa.""

Related:'Selling Sunset' Star Bre Tiesi Says Nick Cannon Doesn't Have to Pay Child Support After Having 10 Kids  This isn't the first time Cannon's sperm has been described as superior. In an April episode of Howie Mandel Does Stuff, the actor said he thinks he has ""super sperm"" as he claimed he practiced birth control and ""people still got pregnant.""  ""I'm gonna be honest, I got some super sperm or something 'cause I've practiced birth control, and people still got pregnant,"" he told Mandel.  Tiesi is quick to point out on the Netflix series that she doesn't rely on the comedian, who is dad to 11 other children, to finance her own life — or that of their child. ""I take care of myself,"" she says. ""If my son needs something, or we do, I ask, that's all I have to do. I know he's a good dad and Nick is not my sugar daddy, Nick is not the reason I'm where I'm at.""  Story continues  Although Tiesi is the newest Selling Sunset addition, the mom quickly became the talk of the luxury reality company, with the returning agents seen asking questions about the logistics of her relationship with the Masked Singer host.  Tiesi's parenting faces season-long scrutiny from the other agents, especially Chelsea Lazkani, who repeatedly questions how the two make it work. ""My situation's interesting,"" Tiesi explains to the office in the season's third episode. ""I don't know if I would say I'm single, I've been in — I don't want to call it open, but open relationship.""  Lazkani asks if she would consider it a ""polyamorous relationship,"" to which Tiesi replies, ""I don't know about that. I just know we had a baby, we're really happy, so I'm really happy in my relationship now.""  For more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!

"birth","2018-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T21:14:49","Names are a very important thing in the Kardashian family. Famously, Kris Jenner’s five daughters all have names that start with a K, but as they’ve began having children of their own, they’ve each also adopted their own unique naming conventions. Kim’s kids all have names that reflect significant locations or have a religious meaning, while Kylie’s children’s names all fit within an atmospheric theme. As for Khloé, she confirmed all her kids will have names beginning with a T, but for nearly a year since her son’s birth, that’s all the info she would reveal about his name. But the mystery may be over now, because Khloé’s bestie Malika Haqq seemed to reveal her baby boy’s name in an Instagram comment.  Khloé gave birth to her second child with Tristan Thompson in July 2022, but in the 10 months since, she’s kept the name of True’s little brother a secret. The only hint she dropped was during an appearance on The Jennifer Hudson Show in April, when she confirmed her son’s name starts with a T to match his dad and big sister. Shortly after that, tabloids began to report that the child was named Tatum Robert Thompson, with his middle name being a tribute to Khloé’s late father. The reports went unconfirmed, though... until Khloé’s best friend Malika gave them some credence.  On May 19, Khloé posted a couple photos of herself and her almost-1-year-old son. Malika’s comment on the pic is what stole the show, though. “Go Tate!” she wrote, basically confirming his name is Tatum.  Although Malika’s comment seems like pretty strong confirmation that Khloé’s son is named Tatum, nothing is really official-official until Khloé reveals the name herself. Back in 2018, Khloé revealed True’s name to the world right away, posting the name days after giving birth; it seems like she’s leaning more into her sister Kylie’s more secretive strategy when it comes to her second child’s name.  Hulu  Kylie revealed her son Aire’s name right before his first birthday. With Khloé’s son about to turn 1 year old in July, maybe that’s when the proud mom will reveal if he really is named Tatum or not.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsaXRlZGFpbHkuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvbWFsaWthLWhhcXEtY29tbWVudC1raGxvZS1rYXJkYXNoaWFuLWluc3RhZ3JhbS1zb24tbmFtZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"birth","2023-12-04","Not Discerned","{""Evanston"", ""Wyoming"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T13:20:01","A rare, beautiful white bison was born this past Tuesday at Bear River State Park in Evanston, Wyoming. The park stretches across 328 acres and houses ten adult bison and five calves. The birth of the white bison is the first time its ever happened at the state park.  According to the National Bison Association, birthing an albino white bison is a one-in-10-million chance. For reference, the odds of being killed by a meteor are 1-in-1.6 million and the odds of being in a plane crash are 1-in-20 million.  So in layman’s terms, the albino white bison is incredibly rare.  Tyfani Sager, the Park’s Superintendent, said that new bison offspring is rather small but is healthy and doing well. The sex of the yet to be named child is unknown, and it has reportedly been up and nursing from its mother, Wyoming Hope.  Sager spoke to Cowboy State Daily about how protective the bison cows are of their young and how it has made it challenging to gather more information about the white bison. She states:  “We’re not sure if it’s a bull calf or a heifer calf. They’re real furry and it’s hard to tell right off the bat.”  The state park in Evanston apparently was given two white bison heifers from Jackson Fork Ranch in Bondurant, Wyoming, and the second heifer isn’t expected to give birth until early next year. As for Wyoming Hope, the mother of the new born, she was bred by one of the bulls that is a resident at Bear River State Park.  When asked about the rarity of the birth considering the dwindling numbers of bison, Sager responded:  “Most of the bison you find anymore have some cattle genetics. They were nearly hunted to extinction by the late 1800s. People got concerned about extinction and cattle inbreeding was used. A white bison birth is still fairly rare.”  I’m sure the little white bison will have quite the fanbase as it gets older. Sager went on to say that those who live near the Bear River State Park will likely be able to get a good look at the newborn from off of the park’s nearly ten miles of trails.  And who knows, maybe it’ll grow up to look like this behemoth one day:","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndoaXNrZXlyaWZmLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzIwL3JhcmUtd2hpdGUtYmlzb24tYm9ybi1hdC1iZWFyLXJpdmVyLXN0YXRlLXBhcmstaW4td3lvbWluZy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

You are highly creative on a mental level, have an excellent memory, and love a good debate. Sometimes short on patience, you might feel that others don’t move as quickly in thought as you do. However, you are also a people person. Your ideas on love and relationship are unique.  Famous people born today: Plato, Henri Rousseau, Mr. T, Raymond Burr, Fairuza Balk, Lisa Edelstein, Judge Reinhold, Chase Sui Wonders, Nick Cassavetes, Adriana Ozores, Kevin Quinn, Sarah Ramos, Kate Phillips, Noel Fielding, Belinda Bromilow, Kyle Red Silverstein, David Ajala, Kevin Quinn, Olivia Olson.  Your Birthday Year Forecast:  Your birthday this year occurs shortly after a New Moon, suggesting a time of new beginnings and fresh energy. You are instinctively starting a new phase in your life. It’s time to give your life a makeover and to branch out into the untried.  This can be a year in which you experience important turning points, or you could begin new projects or goals that have a long-term impact on your life.  Pluto begins its long-term harmonious aspect to your Sun this year, and you want your objectives to reflect what you’re really about. You’re likely to rid yourself of unsatisfying goals at this time in your life. Your ability to concentrate and focus helps you to achieve what you set out to do. A new project or goal begun this year has a good chance of being successful and long-lasting. Your physical activities tend to be more intense, passionate, and focused.  It’s an excellent period for making a lifestyle change–your ability to concentrate on what really matters to you is enhanced. This is a powerfully supportive influence. You’re making empowering changes that can redirect you in wonderful ways.  This can also be a year in which you are doing a lot of connecting and creating. The connections you make tend to be growth-oriented and encouraging. People more readily recognize your intelligence or unique insight this year. You can experience more popularity and more interest in connecting. Opportunities come into your life that send you on a happy path.  There can be times when your varied interests lead to feeling scattered or pulled in a number of directions, and you could find yourself very busy and perhaps in demand. However, it’s also a strong year for making connections, communicating, reaching out, and learning many useful tidbits.  Joie de vivre and increased energy can truly enhance your life in many ways, not only because you are more able to enjoy life this way, but also because others sense your dynamism and you are likely to attract good things to you as a result. Stress eases as you feel more confident about your abilities and your judgment. Also, you are more able to assert yourself without rubbing people the wrong way.  Even so, there can be some wavering of energy or motivation at times. Taking time for gathering yourself, and perhaps seeking new inspiration, can be helpful.  You can bring great discipline and meaning to mental work of any kind this year. This is a time when dedication and commitment to your goals run high. As far as mental output goes, you are more productive in a reliable and consistent way. You derive satisfaction from a job well done. You may be more deliberate in how you approach communicating with others, choosing your words more carefully and successfully. Advances in intellectual and mental pursuits are likely, as you make steady progress that has long-lasting results.  The period ahead also favors imaginative pursuits and entertainment. You seem to have a strong sense of trends.  This can be an inspired, perhaps unusual year for your romantic or social life. It’s not always easy to think clearly or objectively in these areas. There can be sudden whims, interests, and attractions.  Even so, Mars-Pluto energy with you this year is a little more complicated. If channeled positively, you could move mountains when it comes to pushing your projects ahead. If mishandled, however, you could be argumentative, stressed, and hell-bent on having your way! The bottom line is a tendency towards obsessive or compulsive behavior. Avoid taking extreme measures to make things happen your way. Similarly, avoid people who might be doing the same. Deliberately trying to maneuver things in order to get the upper hand will be a lesson in frustration this year.  As well, watch for taking on too many interests and activities. Your desire nature is stronger than usual, but it’s best not to push things too hard. However, harnessed well, with this energy you can stand to gain great insight into your belief system. You could also think in big, successful terms and open yourself to the potential for great achievements as a result. The caution here is not to alienate others, and to avoid excesses and over-indulgence.  There can be a greater interest in relationships and love. It’s a great time for excursions, romantic connections, popularity with your ideas and words, and personal charm.  Friends could be made on trips or through education or shared interests. Publishing, learning, or promoting can figure strongly. It’s a good year to connect with people with mutual interests. Cooperation can result in some great progress and success.  There can be helpful interactions with superiors or with older or more experienced people during this period, and benefits can come as a result. There can be a choice to structure, limit, or simplify your life in a significant way that leads to major improvements in your life.  Summary:  The year ahead brings more determination to your personality. You are heading in different directions, and a change of pace is refreshing. The year is also powerful for learning, guiding, observing, and particular enjoyment of personal interests.  2023 is a Number Six year for you. Ruled by Venus. This is a year of relative contentment. It's a time when love is the easiest to attract, and partnerships formed under this vibration have a better chance for longevity. You are especially able to attract others--and material things as well--this year. This is a good year for establishing harmony in the family and the home. Advice - develop existing relationships, be positive and receptive because these kinds of energies help you to attract what you desire.  2024 will be a Number Seven year for you. Ruled by Neptune. This is a year of preparation, chance, and refinement. It is not a time of dramatic changes. Instead, it's a year when reflection on the past is helpful, and when refinements to your life path should be made. It's a good year to study, observe, research, and analyze. Unexpected twists to your life story and ""chance"" meetings are probable. Advice - take stock of your life in order to prepare for more exciting years to come, examine the past and plan for the future, get in touch with your deepest needs and uncover your personal power, don't strain yourself or actively try to expand.

Roy, aged 76, was born on August 1, 1946, in Brooklyn, New York, and peacefully departed this world on May 17, 2023, in Jacksonville, Florida. His loss is mourned by his family, friends, and all those whose lives he touched.  Having attended the Navy ET School, Leonard served with distinction in the United States Navy (ET) for three years. Following his military service, he became the proud owner of Roy’s TV Sales & Service, where he shared his expertise and passion for electronics with the community he served.  Beyond his professional pursuits, Roy had a deep love for nature and spending time outdoors. He found solace in gardening, treasured the serenity of hiking, and possessed a remarkable talent for carpentry. These passions brought him joy.  However, Roy's most cherished moments in life were rooted in his relationships. His unwavering faith in Jesus Christ was a source of strength and inspiration, guiding his path and shaping his character. The day he married Linda marked a milestone of love and commitment that brought immeasurable joy to his heart. The birth of his son, Lenny, filled his life with purpose and pride, and the arrival of his beloved grandchildren further enriched his existence.  Roy will be remembered for his kind and gentle nature, his warm smile, and his ability to make everyone feel valued and loved. His generosity knew no bounds, and he was always there to lend a helping hand or offer words of wisdom. Roy's presence will be deeply missed by all who had the privilege of knowing him.  As we mourn Roy's passing, let us also celebrate his remarkable life. May his memory serve as a reminder of the importance of faith, love, and cherished moments shared with family and friends. Though he is no longer with us, his spirit will forever live on in our hearts.  Roy was preceded in death by his parents, Leonard LeRoy Curry and Catherine Anne Curry.  He is survived by his devoted wife, Linda Curry, their loving son, Leonard “Lenny” Boyd Curry (Molly), and cherished grandchildren, Leonard “Boyd” Curry, II, Brooke Leigh Curry, and Bridget Caroline Curry. He also leaves behind his brother, Patrick Scott Curry, and sisters Kathy Leahy and Michelle Mcabee.

On Wednesday, April 19, the 19-year-old was hanging out in his old neighborhood along the 4900 block of Olive Street in West Philadelphia.  ""Where he was killed at, we used to live right around the corner from there for years,"" said Folayan.  At 10:40 p.m. police were called to the area for a shooting.  ""You could see Tahmir just coming around the corner and then you see the two guys come like ambush him from the back and shoot him,"" recalled Folayan.  She is referring to surveillance video of the shooting that has yet to be released publicly. The two suspects were both wearing masks, but no other description has been released.  Hightower died at the hospital.  ""Every day I wake up and I come to the reality that I can't see my son again,"" said Folayan.  The City of Philadelphia is offering up to $20,000 in reward money for information that leads to the arrest and conviction of the person responsible. All you have to do is call the Citizens Crime Commission at 215-546-TIPS. All calls will remain anonymous.

"birth","2023-05-11","Not Discerned","{""Oswiecim"", ""Malopolskie"", ""Poland""}","2023-05-20T13:53:47","“The Zone of Interest,” adapted from the novel by Martin Amis, is Glazer’s first film in a decade. The British director has only three feature credits to his name, but each one — the raucous “Sexy Beast” (2001), the stunning Nicole Kidman drama “Birth” (2004) and the sci-fi tour de force “Under the Skin” (2014) — is so potent that he has never felt far gone.  Still, Glazer has never had a mainstream breakthrough or significant awards push, and I’m curious if it can come with “The Zone of Interest,” which will be distributed by A24 later this year. A Palme d’Or at Cannes would certainly help, but Glazer’s directing ought to attract a lot of attention: He frames the family’s mundane activities in static wide shots, cutting only when someone enters another room, as though they themselves are under eerie surveillance.  The Cannes jury might also reward Hüller, whose performance as selfish Hedwig is chilling. As Jews are killed next door, she recalls a trip and asks her husband, “Will you take me to the spa in Italy again? All that pampering.” Anything that happens past the walls of her luxurious garden simply doesn't exist, or else it offers a mercenary opportunity: She eagerly tries on a confiscated fur coat and tells Rudolf to look for more items stolen from the camp’s prisoners. “Chocolate, if you see it,” she wheedles. “Tiny goodies.”  And if the film connects enough to become an awards contender down the road, I hope voters will pay attention to its carefully calibrated sound design. In the early going, there’s a hush, the kind of quiet you can have only if something is notably absent. Later, the sounds that drift from the camp are harder to ignore. Perhaps when “The Zone of Interest” began, we were listening through Hedwig’s ears.  As we filed out after the premiere, the man sitting next to me confessed that he only understood 50 percent of the film. But I think the other 50 percent is meant to be felt, and for all of Glazer’s formal precision, he leaves plenty of room for viewers to come to their own conclusions. Does the family’s denial have contemporary parallels? How do the rhythms of work and life mitigate unimaginable horrors? And what did you hear in the hush before you could make out the screams?","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMjAvbW92aWVzL3pvbmUtb2YtaW50ZXJlc3Qtam9uYXRoYW4tZ2xhemVyLWNhbm5lcy5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(WCTV) - Dozens of mothers new and expecting were out at the Turnbull Center Saturday able to connect with resources, service providers and vendors to assist with their most important job of all, parenting.  Tallahassee Memorial Healthcare service line administrator Kim Outlaw said the event helps to inform mothers about the best decisions they can make before, during and after child birth.  “During their pregnancy, we want to make sure that they have a healthy pregnancy and making the decisions that they need to have a healthy outcome for them and their baby,” Outlaw said.  Outlaw said the service providers are able to educate the new and expecting mothers on best practices for nutrition, medical decisions and even connect them with daycare services.  “We want to make sure they get into prenatal care, that they connect with a physician so they can be followed through their pregnancy and hopefully prevent any concerns,” Outlaw said.  Haleigh Johnson attended the event with her four-year-old daughter to learn about resources through Leon County Schools for voluntary pre-kindergarten classes and health screenings for her daughter.  “Finding child care is a big one, and trying to find one that works around a working mom’s schedule and is financially affordable,” Johnson said.  The event also offered services and information on maternity and post-partum care and depression.  The free family-friendly event also hosted break-out sessions on parenthood planning, developmental milestones in a young child’s life, car seat installations and more.  “There’s a lot of resources about pregnancy, childbirth classes, there’s resources for breastfeeding, there’s resources for pediatricians,” Outlaw said.  Outlaw said for expecting mothers nutrition for themselves and their child is top of mind, and urges avoiding harmful activities like smoking and drinking alcohol.  The event was held in person for the first time in two years and with a whole summer to choose a viable after-school care Johnson said any help was welcomed.  “There’s a lot of things they can learn about different opportunities for children and for moms,” Johnson said.  The event ran from 10 am to 1 pm.  To stay up to date on all the latest news as it develops, follow WCTV on Facebook and Twitter.  Have a news tip or see an error that needs correction?

"birth","2023-05-20","06:00:00","{""Coventry"", ""Coventry"", ""UnitedKingdom""}","2023-05-20T14:40:32","London, England, May 20, 2023 / 06:00 am (CNA).  An English woman with Down syndrome is taking her fight against the U.K.’s abortion laws to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).  Heidi Crowter, from Coventry in the U.K., says that the current legislation discriminates against people with disabilities by allowing abortion up to birth if the fetus has a condition such as Down syndrome. The 27-year-old mother, who actively campaigns on social media, announced her decision to appeal to the ECHR this week after the country’s Supreme Court refused to hear her case.  Crowter has been campaigning for a change in the law since 2018, when she joined a legal challenge brought by another mother whose son has Down syndrome.  She argues that the law sends a message that people with disabilities are not valued equally and that it violates their human rights. “In 2023, we live in a society where disabled people are valued equally after birth but not in the womb,” she said in a statement.  The U.K. government defends the law as a balance between the rights of women and the rights of the unborn child. It says that abortion is a personal choice and that women should have access to safe and legal services. The Court of Appeal ruled in November 2022 that the law was not unlawful and did not interfere with the rights of the living disabled.  Crowter’s case has attracted support from disability-rights groups and pro-life organizations. Ross Hendry, CEO of CARE, a Christian charity that advocates for life issues, said: “It is completely wrong that disability is a ground for abortion up to birth. Would we accept a law allowing babies to be aborted to term based on their sex, or their race? The current approach sends a message that the lives of people with disabilities are worth less than others.”  Lynn Murray, spokesperson for Don’t Screen Us Out whose daughter Rachel has Down syndrome, said: “It’s inspiring to see that Heidi is now going to be taking her landmark case all the way to the European Court of Human Rights at Strasbourg. As a mother of a 23-year-old daughter who has Down syndrome, I see every day the unique value she brings to our family and the positive impact she has on others around her.”  Currently in England, Wales, and Scotland, there is a general 24-week time limit for abortion, but if the baby has a disability, including Down syndrome, cleft lip, and club foot, abortion is legal right up to birth. There were 3,370 disability-selective abortions in 2021, a 9% increase from 3,083 in 2020. The number of late-term abortions at 24 weeks’ gestation or over where the baby has a disability increased by 20% from 229 to 274.  If Crowter wins her case at the ECHR in Strasbourg, it could have implications for all 46 countries that are members of the Council of Europe, which are bound by its rulings. Crowter hopes that her case will inspire others to stand up for their rights and dignity.  “I am taking this case to Strasbourg because it is downright discrimination that people with disabilities are treated differently,” she said.  The ECHR’s decision is expected to be issued sometime in 2023.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYXRob2xpY3dvcmxkcmVwb3J0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzIwL3dvbWFuLXdpdGgtZG93bi1zeW5kcm9tZS1zdWVzLW92ZXItYWJvcnRpb24tbGF3LWF0LWV1cm9wZWFuLWNvdXJ0LW9mLWh1bWFuLXJpZ2h0cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"birth","2023-05-17","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T20:00:00","Several years ago, Capri Cook was concerned to hear that two local Black women died after having their babies — then she was even more shocked to learn that fatal outcomes during childbirth are three to four times more likely to happen to Blacks.  “It’s a national crisis, but it’s not being treated as such,” Cook said. “What in the world is going on?”  That question is being addressed in many circles, from workers in local health-related agencies to politicians on Capitol Hill.  The Rappahannock Area Health District and Mary Washington Healthcare on Wednesday will present “Birthing Justice,” a movie that examines the issue and looks at ways to advocate for Black women.  The film will be shown at the Mayfield Community Center, 311 Glover St. in Fredericksburg and is open to the community. Doors open at 5:30 p.m., the movie begins at 6:15 and a panel discussion will follow.  On a national level, Sen. Tim Kaine, D–Virginia, last week reintroduced 13 bills in the Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act, aimed at reversing the lethal trend.  “It’s unacceptable that the U.S. maternal mortality rate has risen, even though more than 80% of these deaths are preventable,” Kaine said in a news release. “We can’t ignore this maternal health crisis.”  ‘That is insane’  More American women are dying during childbirth than in any other developed country, and death rates in the U.S. are higher than they’ve been in decades, according to the World Health Organization and other international groups that track the numbers.  There were 23.8 deaths per 100,000 births in the United States in 2020, according to a chart on The Commonwealth Fund website. The next-highest country, New Zealand, had 13.6 deaths while the country with the lowest rates, the Netherlands, recorded 1.2 deaths per 100,000 births.  America’s averages along color lines are even more disturbing. The rate of maternal death per 100,000 births is 18.2 for Hispanics, 19.1 for whites and 55.3 for Blacks, according to The Commonwealth Fund.  “That is insane. That absolutely blew me away,” said Alexandra Boatwright, a Stafford County graduate who researched the issue of maternal death for her college thesis last year.  Like Cook, she didn’t find many explanations for the disparity, other than skin color, she said in a Free Lance–Star story last year.  “Racism is a key driver of this crisis,” she said. “There are so many examples of it, unfortunately, it has pervaded maternal health.”  In her attempt to address the problem, beyond her thesis, Boatwright became a labor and delivery nurse at Mary Washington Hospital last summer.  Likewise, when Cook heard about the local deaths, she checked around to see how many doulas are in the Fredericksburg area. Doulas are trained to work with and advocate for women before, during and after childbirth, and she found a shortage of Black doulas in the region.  She “decided to be the change” and became trained three years ago. As she’s accompanied women to labor and delivery rooms, she’s regularly had to speak up for those of color when their comments about how they were feeling were dismissed by medical providers.  “They don’t take us seriously because they think we want pain medicine, or it’s a bias thing,” Cook said, adding that women without health insurance “are not treated equally as those with resources.”  Cook, who’s 32, lives in Richmond and has clients in the Fredericksburg area, tells mothers they are the masters of their own bodies.  “You have the gut instinct about yourself, that something is not right, and when you’re not heard,” she said, “that is a recipe for disaster.”  ‘A red flag’  When local officials conducted the 2022 Community Health Assessment, which asked people to name top health-related concerns in the region, racial disparities showed up in the category of births, said Allison Balmes–John. She’s spokesperson for the Rappahannock Area Health District, which includes Fredericksburg and the counties of Caroline, King George, Spotsylvania and Stafford.  But the differences pertained to low birthweights of infants, not necessarily death rates of mothers. In every locality but Caroline, twice as many Black infants had low birthweights as white ones. (Stats are on page 31 of the report, found online at vdh.virginia.gov/rappahannock. Search for FY23-FY25 CHA/CHIP.)  A low birthweight is less than 5 pounds, 8 ounces, according to the March of Dimes. While some small babies are healthy, others are at risk of serious problems including development delays.  The most pronounced disparity locally was in Fredericksburg, where 14% of Black babies had low birthweights compared to 6% of white babies, according to the local health assessment.  “This was a red flag for us as to the inequities in maternal and infant health outcomes in our area,” Balmes–John said.  As she and Valerie Hopson–Bell, a health equity specialist with the district, looked at ways to address the disparities, they found a lot of evidence-based data on doulas and their work with women. While much of their attention focuses on childbirth itself, a doula’s goal is for mom and baby to have “the healthiest, most satisfying experience ever,” according to DONA International, which has been training doulas for 25 years.  Last year, Virginia became the fourth state to cover doula services through Medicaid, and as Hopson–Bell talked with health officials, she realized a lot of providers didn’t know that.  “If our professionals aren’t aware of that, just think about the folks who could be using the services,” she said.  The two decided to bring the film “Birthing Justice” to the Fredericksburg area, both to highlight the racial disparities of maternal deaths and the availability of advocates, who can follow women through the birthing process.  “The unique thing about a doula is that’s someone really dedicated to you,” Balmes–John said. “It does provide an opportunity for somebody who looks like you and can relate to you to be in the room.”  Birth supporters  Birth in Color RVA is a Richmond-based nonprofit that focuses on raising awareness about maternal health and reproductive justice. It has six offices throughout Virginia, including in the Northern Neck, and the nonprofit is working with local agencies to share the film, “Birthing Justice,” after it was released earlier this year on PBS.  Birth in Color has already presented screenings in Richmond, Danville and Lynchburg, said Sequoi Phipps–Hawkins, marketing director.  Kenda Sutton–El, the nonprofit’s founder, likes to say that “birth work is in our ancestral DNA,” and that the modern role of the doula is an extension of a time-honored tradition of women being at the bedside to help other females during the process.  “Birth in Africa and around the world was historically supported by women, and often only women,” Phipps–Hawkins said. “For women of color specifically, our ancestors were often birth supporters in some capacity.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisQFodHRwczovL2ZyZWRlcmlja3NidXJnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2ZyZWRlcmlja3NidXJnLWFyZWEtaGVhbHRoLW9mZmljaWFscy1hZGRyZXNzLXRoZS1uYXRpb25hbC1jcmlzaXMtb2YtYmxhY2stbWF0ZXJuYWwtZGVhdGhzL2FydGljbGVfOWEwNTM2YTYtZjU5NC0xMWVkLTg4ZjAtZmY2MTgwY2Y1NzNjLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"birth","2023-05-19","14:00:00","{""Toluca"", ""Mexico"", ""Mexico""}","2023-05-21T00:28:12","Last week, I headed to the Registro Civil with — finally! — all of my divorce paperwork ready to be processed. After three long years, it was happening, and, oh boy, have I been ready to officially, legally move on!  Alas, when I arrived, there was a problem: my foreign birth certificate (a document which only recently has been required for divorce, I’m told) had not been apostilled and officially translated — that is, it hadn’t been translated by a perito traductor, literally a “translation specialist,” who is authorized to translate and guarantee the faithful translation of official documents.  I cried, kind of hard.  When I got married at that same Registro Civil, after all, back when I was just barely starting to call myself a translator, the officials were accommodating.  “Oh, you can just translate your birth certificate for us yourself, it’s fine!” the lady told me.  I did and felt immediately proud to have had my translation accepted by an official government entity, however informally. Motivated, I decided I’d try to become a perito traductor myself.  The path to that coveted position, however, ended before it began: on the call for applications that a friend sent me, the first item on the list of requirements to apply was to be a Mexican citizen.  Honestly, it was their loss; I’m awesome.  I was disappointed but didn’t let it stop me. Since then, I’ve become an official translator for some great media organizations, a handful of very low-paid translation agencies (not my fave) and lots and lots of Spanish-language TV shows for the major streaming services.  I have no idea who the English-speaking (and apparently non-Spanish-speaking) audience is for Colombian soap operas, but apparently it’s a big enough group to warrant English subtitles for all of them.  I really love translating. Let me count the ways!  It takes a lot of logic and linguistic know-how, of course, but it’s also creative, like trying to recreate the final product from a recipe without any of the original ingredients. It needs to taste the same, smell the same and feel the same, but it must be produced with completely different elements than the original.  And there’s a lot that needs to be addressed when translating: First and foremost, what’s the purpose of the translation? If it’s to entertain, then more creative license can be taken, a fun spot where one’s writing skills enter the picture as well. (Literary translation is where I find great satisfaction in that area, and I would point you in the direction of some really fun material if it weren’t for NDAs.)  If it’s to give instructions, then it needs to be straightforward and simplified: no flowery language wanted that might confuse the reader. For legal or medical purposes, there are often two steps: firstly, figuring out exactly what the message is in the original language, and secondly, finding the equivalent jargon in the target language.  It requires a delicate and careful sensibility as anything “off” could trigger serious consequences.  There are plenty of other questions to consider as well: What if the original writing is…not good? If it’s filled with mistakes (which definitely happens), do you replicate the sloppy style or “clean it up” for the translated version? (I personally clean them up; I just can’t send in work that’s not grammatically sound or is full of mistakes.)  There can be varying levels of extremes on this question. I was recently asked to translate from an unedited audio transcription, for example, and it was a literal nightmare — void of even a tiny bit of punctuation that might give clues as to the meaning of what was being said.  In such a case, you don’t want the English version to sound like an essay (that is, if you figure out what they’re trying to say in the first place) but rather conversational. But to what degree do you insert all the repeated words, the stutters, the skipping around of narrative?  Depending on the purpose of the translation itself, you may get a little room to play, or it could entail parameters of a nearly military nature. But however it’s ultimately done, it’s so, so, satisfying: looking at one’s perfect translation is like putting the final piece of a puzzle into its place. Ahh.  But for all this love I have for my craft — part science, part art — I’m nervous. Machine translation is getting better. It’s not human-quality better, but might that only be a matter of time?  Google Translate 10 years ago was comically terrible. Nowadays, it does a pretty decent job with most things, though the original text still needs to be perfect in order for Google to spit out something of any kind of quality.  Artificial Intelligence (which I believe is badly-named; it should be called Collective Intelligence since it uses all the human material we’ve managed to preserve so far) seems poised to — at least eventually — render my work as a writer and translator unnecessary in fields that are already precarious career-wise: full-time salaried positions in these areas are essentially nonexistent, and most people who do them are freelancers or else contract workers who are called freelancers.  Will peritos traductores eventually be replaced by AI programs as well? Will we all feel comfortable with so much content void of the human touch?  For now, I’m still safe. AI doesn’t have a human brain, and it reduces the quality of pretty much any translation. Will people care, though, if translations are bad but basically understandable?  I’m betting that they will, at least for important things.  Sarah DeVries is a writer and translator based in Xalapa, Veracruz.

"birth","1979-05-20","Not Discerned","{""Guwahati"", ""Assam"", ""India""}","2023-05-21T05:26:03","Guwahati, May 20: In the wake of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the U.S., the threat of global terrorism -- rooted in the Middle East and South Asia -- has taken the center stage. While these extremely violent religious extremists represent a minority view, their threat is real.  The year 1979 was a turning point in international terrorism. Throughout the Arab world and the West, the Iranian Islamic revolution sparked fears of a wave of revolutionary Shia Islam. Meanwhile, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the subsequent anti-Soviet mujahedeen war, lasting from 1979 to 1989, stimulated the rise and expansion of terrorist groups.  Pakistan, struggling to balance its needs for political-economic reform with a domestic religious agenda, provides assistance to terrorist groups both in Afghanistan and Kashmir while acting as a further transit area between the Middle East and South Asia.  Since their emergence in 1994, the Pakistani-supported Taliban militia in Afghanistan has assumed several characteristics traditionally associated with state-sponsors of terrorism, providing logistical support, travel documentation, and training facilities. Although radical groups such as the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda, and Kashmiri militants were in Afghanistan prior to the Taliban, the spread of Taliban control has seen Afghan-based terrorism evolve into a relatively coordinated, widespread activity focused on sustaining and developing terrorist capabilities.  Since the mid-1990s, Pakistani-backed terrorist groups fighting in Kashmir have increasingly used training camps inside Taliban-controlled areas. At the same time, members of these groups, as well as thousands of youths from Pakistan's Northwest Frontier Province (NWFP), have fought with the Taliban against opposition forces. This activity has seen the rise of extremism in parts of Pakistan neighboring Afghanistan, further complicating the ability of Islamabad to exert control over militants. Moreover, the intermixing of Pakistani movements with the Taliban and their Arab-Afghan allies has seen ties between these groups strengthen.  The roots of terrorism in Pakistan can be traced back to 1979 when Soviet Union had occupied Afghanistan. Terrorism in Pakistan originated after Pakistan supported the Afghan mujahideen during the Soviet–Afghan War, and the subsequent civil war that erupted in Afghanistan. The mujahideen fighters were trained by Pakistan's military, American CIA and other western intelligence agencies who continued operations in the area after the war officially ended.  Terrorism in Pakistan poses a significant threat to the people of Pakistan and its neighbouring countries. The wave of terrorism in Pakistan is believed to have started in 2001 with 9/11 attack.  Pakistan is a Muslim majority nation in South East Asia with India to its east, Iran and Afghanistan to its west, China and the landlocked Asian countries to its north and the Arabian Sea to its south. Pakistan gained independence from British colonial rule in 1947 and is the only Muslim country with nuclear weapons – a nuclear device was detonated in 1998 – and is thus part of the informally named ‘nuclear club.’ Pakistan is a federation of four provinces (Punjab, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) and Balochistan), a capital territory (Islamabad) and a group of federally administered tribal areas in the north west, along with the disputed area of Azad Jammu and Kashmir.  Analysis of terrorism in Pakistan has often suffered from simplifications, generalisations and stereotyping. Seen either as an extension of global Islamic extremism or worse a nursery that breeds this transnational threat, the country has regularly been ostracized and chastised by the international community.  Since Islamic extremism has widely been regarded as a malevolent force that can only be perceived in apocalyptic terms, Pakistan therefore has attracted the attention of a number of alarmists and doomsday prophets. This negative attention has subsequently produced a discourse on one of the most dangerous countries in world that narrowly focuses on the security threat posed by Pakistan.  Such superficial and shallow engagement with the problem is deeply unfair, as it selfishly presents terrorism in the country as a danger to the rest of the world and cruelly ignores its primary affectees – the people of Pakistan.  There’s a high threat of terrorism and sectarian violence throughout the country. The main terrorist threat comes from Tehrik-e Taleban Pakistan (TTP), an umbrella organisation of groups primarily based in the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). The Islamic State (ISIS) or locally known as Daesh is also active in the region. While both groups’ activities are primarily directed against the Pakistani state, they have in the past stated intent to launch attacks on western interests. TTP and Daesh conduct attacks throughout Pakistan.      India-Pakistan Relations and Terrorism      India–Pakistan relations are the bilateral ties between the Republic of India and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. The two countries have a complex and largely hostile relationship that is rooted in a multitude of historical and political events, most notably the partition of British India in August 1947.  While both countries established full diplomatic ties shortly after their formal independence, their relationship was quickly overshadowed by the mutual effects of the partition as well as by the emergence of conflicting territorial claims over various princely states, with the most significant dispute being that of Jammu and Kashmir.  India and Pakistan have fought in numerous armed conflicts since their independence. There are three major wars that have taken place between the two states, namely in 1947, 1965 and the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. In addition to this was the unofficial Kargil War in 1999 and some border skirmishes.  The adversarial relations between India and Pakistan have largely been characterized by their outstanding territorial disputes, which owe their origin to the partition. The non-resolution of these disputes has, however, widened the scope of the overall conflict with the addition of non-traditional or structural conflicts. Among this non-traditional genre of confrontation, terrorism undoubtedly takes the centre stage. The reason behind this may be a mix of tangible and intangible factors but, for the last some years, terrorism has emerged as a separate bilateral issue between the two countries.  Interestingly, it was the difference between the two countries over their respective ‘positions’ on this issue, which proved to be the stumbling block at the Agra Summit as well as the worsening of bilateral relations in the aftermath of 9/11 and the terrorist attack on the Indian parliament. The positional adjustment on the same issue (on the part of Pakistan) became the starting point of the current peace process initiated in February 2004.  Amidst the deep-rooted mistrust between India and Pakistan, it may be difficult to establish the ‘factuality’ of the terrorism-related charges both countries hurl at each other from time to time. The same element of mistrust lends an equal ease to denial of the involvement in subversive acts against the other country.  Pakistani Insurgent Activities in India  The most notable attack was the hijacking of Indian Airlines Flight IC 814 en route New Delhi from Kathmandu, Nepal. The plane was hijacked on 24 December 1999 approximately one hour after takeoff and was taken to Amritsar airport and then to Lahore in Pakistan. Under intense media pressure, New Delhi complied with the hijackers' demand and freed Maulana Masood Azhar from its captivity in return for the freedom of the Indian passengers on the flight.  On 22 December 2000, a group of terrorists belonging to the Lashkar-e-Taiba stormed the famous Red Fort in New Delhi. The Fort houses an Indian military unit and a high-security interrogation cell used both by the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Indian Army. The terrorists successfully breached the security cover around the Red Fort and opened fire at the Indian military personnel on duty killing two of them on spot.  The attack on the Indian Parliament was by far the most dramatic attack carried out allegedly by Pakistani terrorists. The Parliament of India in New Delhi on 13 December 2001 was under attack from a group of Pakistan-funded militants, during which fourteen people, including the five men who attacked the building, were killed. The attack led to the deaths of five terrorists, six Delhi Police personnel, two Parliament Security Service personnel and a gardener, in total 14 resulting in the 2001-02 India-Pakistan standoff.  The 2001–2002 India–Pakistan standoff was a military standoff between India and Pakistan that resulted in the massing of troops on either side of the border and along the Line of Control (LoC) in the region of Kashmir. This was the first major military standoff between India and Pakistan since the Kargil War in 1999.  In 2002, India claimed again that terrorists from Jammu and Kashmir were infiltrating into India, a claim denied by Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf, who claimed that such infiltration had stopped—India's spokesperson for the External Affairs Ministry did away with Pakistan's claim, calling it ""terminological inexactitude.""  The 2007 Samjhauta Express bombings was a terrorist attack targeted on the Samjhauta Express train on 18 February. The Samjhauta Express is an international train that runs between New Delhi, India and Lahore, Pakistan, and is one of two trains to cross the India-Pakistan border. At least 68 people were killed, mostly Pakistani civilians but also some Indian security personnel and civilians.  The 2008 Mumbai attacks by ten Pakistani terrorists killed over 173 and wounded 308. The sole surviving gunman Ajmal Kasab who was arrested during the attacks was found to be a Pakistani national. India blamed the Lashkar-e-Taiba, a Pakistan-based militant group, for planning and executing the attacks. Indian officials demanded Pakistan extradite suspects for trial.  Improving India-Pakistan relations is critical in a region where leadership and government need to focus on the great challenges of socioeconomic development, demographics, food and water security, and climate change. Despite existing communication channels and some will for improving the relationship, the prevailing norm of bilateral deadlock ensures a persistent and dangerous risk of new crises and future conflicts.  The nuclear status of each is a continuous reminder of the potential escalatory costs if persisting tensions are not addressed, underlining the importance of doctrinal challenges and the utility of ideas like a return to minimum credible deterrence.  South Asia’s long history of India-Pakistan crises are rich sources for lessons in management. There is the obvious need for resumption of dialogue to address all issues, including political disputes.  The promise of future cooperative counterterrorism measures (like intelligence sharing) hinges on acknowledgement of the fact that both countries are plagued by the challenge of terrorism. Most importantly, however, institutionalized engagement and formal dialogue and crisis management mechanisms are required, including regular summitry and reviving comprehensive dialogue while also expanding to include multiple civil and military levels.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vYXNzYW10cmlidW5lLmNvbS9uYXRpb25hbC90aGUtYmlydGgtb2YtdGVycm9yaXNtLWluLXBha2lzdGFuLWFuZC1pdHMtaW5mbHVlbmNlLWluLWluZGlhLTE0NzcyMTbSAWtodHRwczovL2Fzc2FtdHJpYnVuZS5jb20vYW1wL25hdGlvbmFsL3RoZS1iaXJ0aC1vZi10ZXJyb3Jpc20taW4tcGFraXN0YW4tYW5kLWl0cy1pbmZsdWVuY2UtaW4taW5kaWEtMTQ3NzIxNg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Hypertension, or high blood pressure, affects millions of people worldwide. People over time have found a loophole to keep their blood pressure in control and escape the risks that come with the disease. However, hypertension during pregnancy can be more dangerous than usual, hence requiring careful management to ensure the health and well-being of both mother and baby.  Pregnancy-induced hypertension is also known as gestational hypertension. It affects approximately 5-10 percent of pregnant women and typically arises after the 20th week of gestation. It is characterized by elevated blood pressure levels.  If not brought under control in time, hypertension can lead to serious complications. Pre-eclampsia, eclampsia (seizures or coma in a pregnant woman), placental abruption, and preterm birth are a few problems that can be triggered.  Risk Factors  The exact cause of gestational hypertension is yet not clearly known, but several risk factors have been identified. History of hypertension or preeclampsia in previous pregnancies, obesity, chronic kidney disease, multiple gestations (twins or more), and certain medical conditions like diabetes or autoimmune diseases are a few risk factors that can lead to such a hazardous condition.  During pregnancy, make sure healthcare providers are assessing these risk factors and closely monitoring your blood pressure throughout the pregnancy to promptly identify any signs of hypertension.  Tips To Manage Gestational Hypertension  Managing hypertension during pregnancy is tough. Hence, requires proper understanding and cooperation between the expectant mother and her healthcare team. Regular prenatal check-ups, including blood pressure measurements and urine tests, are essential to monitor the condition’s progression and detect any potential complications.  Meanwhile, for prevention, modifications in lifestyle can be helpful. Adopt a low-sodium healthy diet, exercise regularly (as recommended by the healthcare advisor), and try stress reduction techniques to manage blood pressure levels.  In some cases, doctors also prescribe some medication to control hypertension during pregnancy. However, medicines during this time are critical, as certain antihypertensive drugs can be harmful to the developing fetus. Healthcare providers carefully weigh the risks and benefits in order to suggest appropriate medication that poses minimal harm to the baby.  Pregnant women with pre-existing hypertension are approached differently. They might require close monitoring even before conception and based on their condition doctors make adjustments to their medication regimen to ensure the best outcome for both mother and baby. This is why, it is extremely important to plan an early consultation with a healthcare provider, especially if the woman who wishes to conceive is already dealing with hypertension.  Warning Signs  Warning signs that could indicate complications include severe headaches, visual disturbances, sudden weight gain, swelling of the hands and face, and abdominal pain. These signs should not be ignored during pregnancy, as they could be indicating pre-eclampsia, a severe condition associated with gestational hypertension. If any of these symptoms arise, immediate medical attention should be sought.  Regular prenatal care, a healthy lifestyle, appropriate medical interventions, and vigilant monitoring contribute to a positive outcome. In conclusion, hypertension during pregnancy requires extra care to ensure the well-being of both mother and baby.

It was just days before Christmas last year that Joy Cole and her loved ones received the devastating blow. An MRI scan showed a large sarcoma in her left thigh and the 38-year-old, who works as a radiotherapist at James Cook University Hospital, says she feared she wouldn't see next Christmas.  But within days, specialists told her they aimed to cure the cancer and Joy has undergone gruelling chemotherapy treatment and a life-changing surgery to remove the tumour, and her left leg. Now, the mum-of-four faces another five months of chemotherapy but remains inspirationally positive.  READ MORE: Boro boss Steve Gibson's swanky Rockcliffe Hall in running for top tourism gong  It comes as fellow school mums have banded together to help raise funds to support Joy, her husband Andrew and their four children - nine-year-old Emily, twins Alfie and Daniel, seven, and nine-month-old Alice.  Joy was on maternity leave in October last year when she noticed that the tissue in her thigh ""seemed different"". She spoke with her GP and within a month the lump had grown significantly.  (Image: Joy Cole)  She was referred for MRI scans which confirmed the tumour just four days before Christmas. Joy, whose degree was specialised in oncology, said: ""When it's something you're used to dealing with a lot you can almost become a little bit disengaged with it. I realised I had symptoms of a sarcoma so spoke to my GP about it.  ""I wasn't overly surprised that was the diagnosis they came back with. The GP did show us the MRI images in the consultation and looking at it, the tumour was huge and looked like it had taken up the whole of my thigh.  ""From looking at that image we thought the outcome was going to be really bleak - that this would be my last Christmas and thinking how we deal with things from there.  ""When we saw the specialist at the Freeman on the Friday he said they were aiming to cure it. He said he thought it was a standard osteosarcoma - he was quite quick to say the aim would be to cure it.  ""It made everything seem a lot brighter for us and more hopeful. It's never going to be nice and it will be difficult to get your head around but knowing the specialists are aiming to cure it did make a massive difference.""  Medics found that the tumour - which was already a rare osteosarcoma - was a more uncommon sub-type and among the 10% which are a higher grade. The devoted mum began chemotherapy within weeks and, although it had always been a possibility, was told a fortnight before the life-changing surgery that she would lose her leg from the hip.  After the surgery, Joy returned home and was starting to adapt to the changes and challenges of losing a leg. But she expects to be knocked back as she begins five months of exhausting chemotherapy treatment.  ""It was such a shock initially when we saw the scan and thought things were really bad. Being told there was actually something they could do- that there's no evidence of anything else in the body, there's no definite cancer elsewhere - all those things allowed us to be a bit more positive about it,"" said Joy.  ""My husband and I have tried to be positive about all of it. Our thinking when I was told I'd likely lose my leg was yes it's less than ideal but in the grand scheme of things if I can lose my leg and still be here we're happy with that - as happy as I can be.""  ""I can still be here to see the children grow up. If it's a decision between having two legs and only surviving for X amount of time or losing a leg and having the chance to be here for a lot longer, then it's worth it. And it's worth the chances that comes with that.""  So far more than £8,000 has been raised to support the Norton family. The Go Fund Me page, set up by friends fellow school mums, says: ""Joy has made friends wherever she goes all her life. Her kindness, warmth and wit shine through. We hope this reaches as many of them as possible so we can send her a huge message of love.  ""We know times are hard and money is tight for a lot of people. We also know so many people want to help and even just a small amount will help make a huge difference. Please give if you're able to, we would appreciate all help, no matter how small.""  Joy admits the fundraiser has been ""overwhelming"" at first and were reluctant to agree at first given the hard times many families are facing. But so many people had reached out, and Joy and Andrew know they'd want to support others in their position.  The mum says she's amazed by the support from loved ones, friends and even strangers and says it ""restores your faith in humanity"". She said: ""It's certainly helped on the days you don't feel so positive to see how much support there is.""  To donate to the fundraiser click here.

That’s more than the world is round, not flat; it’s about nature. Birth, life, death, rebirth. In fact, the world is cyclical, the tides, the moons, the seasons. The world is also full of interconnections, mutuality, and interdependence. There’s a clam on the Shell River whose birth is dependent on the gills of a fish, birds which use “anting,” or sit on an ant hill to allow ants to crawl through their feathers, cleaning up various parasites. The lake depends on a river, and we depend on all of this world, this biodiversity and this life. Simply said, we should not destroy it.  Anishinaabe people refer to “relatives” who have wings, feet, hooves or roots, or an intergenerational connection to seven generations past and seven ahead. Life is about connection not isolation. That’s Indigenous thinking, and that’s how people can survive for some thousands of years and still harvest maple sugar from a tree in the forest, and wild rice from the same lake, generation after generation. That’s basically how most Indigenous or land-based peoples understand the world.  Then there are the other folks. That’s called the “dominant culture” these days. And it puzzles me quite a bit, rankles my sensibilities. Who the heck calls their grandchildren Generation Z? What sort of worldview is that supposed to conjure? Not a hopeful one I would say. That’s America, or at least a pretty strong prevailing worldview. The dominant culture imagery and practice is aggressive and encourages isolation. Gee whiz, one of my sons was walking around with some helmet on talking to himself in a virtual world with his friends. Too bad he has to eat nonvirtual food, and use a nonvirtual toilet. Isolation is deadly.  This is a linear worldview, exemplified everywhere in the American economy, from the idea of “trash,” composed of useless and quickly obsolete stuff. When we “throw it away,” where is “away”? In turn, prisons are full of throw away people. Those two are a couple of the fastest growing industries in the U.S. and that’s tragic.  Americans act like there’s a nuclear waste fairy or a carbon sequestration fairy. There is none. I see an America which keeps doing dumb stuff, and hoping somehow it will work out. There’s a perception that technology will save us, and I think that common sense would do better. Sane people don’t poison the water you drink from. Corporations do that, who contaminate aquifers in Missouri and then move to Minnesota, because they have run out of clean water. It doesn’t seem like folks want to hang around for another thousand years or so.  ADVERTISEMENT  We need to learn how to survive, not just how to conquer. But Americans don’t like to look back especially at anything that might disturb them, such as slavery, genocide, holocaust, and a bunch of cool and cruel people all in history. Talking about that history these days is illegal in South Dakota. Learn from history and do better. That’s intelligent.  Heck, we don’t even look back 20 years when we could write cursive. That’s right, public schools are no longer required to teach cursive. What’s that mean? I think it means that they cannot read the writing of their ancestors. Cannot read first-person historic documents, or a letter from the old Uncle Sven. I hate to say it, but languages are going extinct, and skillsets are obsolete, and that’s a societal choice, which makes little sense. Take computer coding for instance. All sorts of folks went to school for that, and now it is pretty much obsolete because we have artificial intelligence and chat.  Prophecies do not bode well for the folks on the linear path I’d say. Seems like everything is obsolete in a minute or so, and that spaceship with Elon Musk to the next planet is probably already full.  Maybe it’s time to just slow it down and think about rebirth. That’s right. And not being obsolete. I really feel like gardening is never going to be obsolete, nor is fixing things, and maybe even being a nice person will not be obsolete. There are plenty of jerks out there, after all.  Each day we have a chance to change. Each spring we have a chance to not plant with a bunch of Roundup and work toward organic and restore soil, not destroy it. Right-to-life folks out there who want to be busy with women’s uteruses, how about life itself, like water, like seeds, like future generations? Why would you want something like Terminator seeds, when the essence of seeds is life and promise? Let’s talk about the right to life of a river, a seed, and future generations, who will not be called Z, but will be called the Oshki Anishinaabe, the new people.  Arundhati Roy writes, “Another world is not only possible, she is on her way. On a quiet day, I can hear her breathing.”  I want my descendants here for that rebirth. So, I am going to put some goodness into the soil and feel connected.  Winona LaDuke is an Ojibwe writer and economist on Minnesota’s White Earth Reservation.

"birth","1969-09-13","Not Discerned","{""Toronto"", ""Ontario"", ""Canada""}","2023-05-20T20:00:00","        The 1960s were drawing to a close. The children of the revolution’s children were looking forward to something fresh—something to revitalise the ideals of Woodstock, which were increasingly looking like a futile pipe-dream. On September 13th, 1969, their own chapter would begin, and the world would never be the same again, evolving into a beastly bonanza of wild hedonism and all the good fun that goes along with it. At least, that was the case for the humans of this mortal coil. But for a poor coop of chickens, that tragic day marked the loss of a friend, family member and beloved community presence.  On that fateful day, the fittingly named Toronto Rock and Roll Revival festival was taking place at the Varsity City Stadium. One of the acts taking to the stage that afternoon was Alice Cooper. Only a few months earlier, a gig at Los Angeles’ Venice Club saw them empty the room in ten minutes flat—the hippy crowd were too freaked out by their Salvador Dalí meets the rock ‘n’ roll circus style, with many of them leaving disgruntled, muttering about some search for ‘the real thing’. It was one of the best gigs Alice Cooper had ever played. They gained a single fan.  The lone clapping straggler happened to be Shep Gordon, a music manager who saw the future potential of this singular act. He sent them Frank Zappa’s way, after all, his label was the highest purveyor of weirdness around. Zappa signed them in an instant. It is important to note that what Zappa signed at this juncture was essentially a psychedelic band with an eccentric frontman. It took a flightless tragedy to bring the shock rock element to the fore.  Nevertheless, thanks to Zappa’s management, Alice Cooper were suddenly set to play in front of the 25,000-strong crowd gathered in sunny Toronto. Meanwhile, Mary Cluckers, a chicken, was heading home. Alas, the Varsity City Stadium was famously open in those days and as Mary ventured along, she spied within its hallowed arena a feathery friend by the stage. So, like many ill-fated chickens before her, Mary sadly crossed the road. She slipped through the gates, and she casually ambled across the delta of wires backstage towards her pal.  Sadly, as Mary had become accustomed in a world without Junglefowl Optometry, the white plumage she had spied was not, in fact, her friend but rather a feathery pillow-based prop that Alice Cooper used during their show. At this stage, all would have been well for the short-sighted Mary Cluckers if this was merely a case of mistaken identity, but in Hitchcockian fashion, it just so happened that Vincent Damon Furnier, the dastardly man behind the Alice Cooper make-up, was about to use that cluster of feathers in an act of neo-rock revelry.  As Furnier crossed the stage mid-performance to retrieve the pillow prop, he saw a chicken pecking at it. From Mary’s perspective, she had travelled all this way only to be met with a faux-plumed imposter, so she may as well engage in a quick harmless cock joust to make it worth the journey. However, the pumped-up Furnier saw nothing other than an act of free-range sabotage as the efficacy of his vital prop was pecked away at one quill at a time. Thinking on his feet, he quickly swept down towards Mary like a line-back, plucked her up in one fell-swoop and held the modest Mary aloft, much to her eternal shame. But worse was yet to come.  Frightened by this sudden heavy-handed abduction and startled by the spotlight and screaming mass of featherless sapiens, she clucked with the sort of force that one might muster if they were auditioning to replace the Kellogg’s rooster. This, in turn, startled Furnier—a man famous for his lack of animal husbandry knowledge. This farmyard ignorance resulted in an error that christened him the shock rocker of his age: he presumed chickens could fly. The panicked Mary could sense this from the ungodly height that he had lifted her to, but there was little she could do about it now; her fate was as sealed as Col. Sanders’ flock.  As is reported by several witnesses in the crowd that day, an odd sense of acceptance is said to have washed over her in this moment—a consigned peace usually only observed by air traffic controllers as doomed pilots relay their final message. As Mary expected, in the blink of a chick’s eye, she was careening towards the crowd. Furnier hurled the winged beast into the audience expecting it to soar to safety, only to see it tumble headfirst towards a group of wheelchair users stationed in a designated area by the front.  Mary tried her best to steer away from this immobile section but her feeble wings only succeeded in displacing the same volume of air as an asthmatic mouse’s shallow sigh. Try as they might – which is actually very rarely – chickens simply cannot fly. The fans that Mary collided with were incensed. Enraged by this farmyard intruder, in what can only be diagnosed as a rock-induced hysteria, they literally tore the poor bastard apart—ripping into her flanks like a drunk returning home on a Sunday evening to devour what was left of the roast’s carcass. Furnier and his band looked on appalled, gobsmacked by both the shocking reality that chickens can’t fly and the primordial behaviour of their differently-abled fans.  The next day, a headline claimed that Furnier, a firm friend of the avians, had, in fact, bitten the chicken’s head clean off himself. Zappa gave him one piece of advice on the matter: “Whatever you do, don’t tell anyone you didn’t do it.” Now, two things happened that day: once again in the inadvertent life of poor old altar boy Vincent Damon Furnier, he found himself thrust towards an ill-begotten musical fate that he had not fully intended upon when he set out to become a friendly, fun rockstar; and Mary was in the headlines for the second time in her life – or now lack thereof – for all the wrong reasons.  So, as the auspicious Toronto Rock and Roll Revival festival decreed, Furnier was now the proverbial shock rocker. The band relished the publicity that came with this clucking carnage and audiences flocked to their shows as a result, heralding a new age of performative pop culture which the world is still very much in the midst of.  But as Alice Cooper celebrated, and a selection of fans considered their actions as they washed entrails from their forearms in festival toilets while the world around them revolved onto a new page, Bob Cluckers, a cock, mourned the loss of his daughter. He had prepared a fine trough of grain for her that evening that went uneaten. A search party was organised within the coop, but the worst was confirmed when they saw Mary’s remains smeared across the back pages of the Toronto Star under a salacious headline that gave little mind to Mary’s plight and only the most fleeting reference to her charity work.  The next morning, Bob sidled away from the fellow mourners and made his way over to an area of the chicken wire fence where a fox sometimes sticks its muzzle through, and he clucked and clucked as loud as he could until his wattle swelled up.  So, next time you think about what the world gained that day through the pantomime of modern pop culture, spare a thought for the cost at which this thrilling pageantry came. Because without Mary, it seems to me that we wouldn’t now be witnessing former politicians chow down raw kangaroo spam javelins on a family television show in order to remain captive in some permanently surveilled jungle as a form of PR repentance, and for better or for worse, that is now a reality that we cannot fly away from.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vZmFyb3V0bWFnYXppbmUuY28udWsvY2x1Y2tpbmctbWFkbmVzcy1pbi1sb3ZpbmctbWVtb3J5LW9mLXRoZS1jaGlja2VuLXRoYXQtY2hhbmdlZC1tdXNpYy1mb3JldmVyL9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vZmFyb3V0bWFnYXppbmUuY28udWsvY2x1Y2tpbmctbWFkbmVzcy1pbi1sb3ZpbmctbWVtb3J5LW9mLXRoZS1jaGlja2VuLXRoYXQtY2hhbmdlZC1tdXNpYy1mb3JldmVyLz9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"birth","2016-10-25","Not Discerned","{""Banjul"", ""Banjul"", ""Gambia""}","2023-05-21T06:27:00","High income countries make the greatest contribution to climate change but the people who have contributed least to the crisis are the most hit, with 91 per cent deaths of preterm babies related to air pollution occurring in low and middle income nations, says a report by UN agencies. The recently released 'Born Too Soon: Decade of Action on Preterm Birth' report by WHO, UNICEF and Partnership for Maternal New Born and Child Health highlights myriad impacts of climate change – both direct and indirect – on pregnancy resulting in stillbirths, preterm birth and small for gestational age. Climate change impacts pregnancy through heat exposure, storms, floods, drought, wildfires and air pollution besides in terms of food insecurity, water or food borne diseases, vector borne diseases, migration, conflict and health system resilience, according to experts.  The report suggested more investment is needed to specifically mitigate risks and to increase focus on women and babies in policies and programmes addressing the climate emergency. Air pollution is estimated to contribute to six million preterm births each year. ''Vulnerability to climate change is a multi-dimensional, dynamic phenomenon shaped by intersecting historical and contemporary political, economic and cultural processes of marginalisation. Societies with high levels of inequity are less resilient to climate change,'' said Dr Ana Bonell from Medical Research Unit at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM).  According to the report, climate change has a harmful impact during the perinatal period. It increases the risk of preterm birth by direct pathways, such as air pollution caused by burning fossil fuels which increases risk by 52 per cent in asthmatic mothers; extreme heat exposure which increases risk by 16 per cent and other extreme weather events, such as drought.  ''Although the impacts of climate change are being felt in all areas of the world, the people most affected have contributed least to the crisis. For example, globally, 91 per cent of deaths of preterm babies related to air pollution occur in low and middle income countries, while high income countries make the greatest contribution to climate change,'' the report said.  Recent estimates suggest that household air pollution was an attributable factor for 15.6 per cent of all low-birth-weight babies and 35.7 per cent of all preterm births, notably in low-income countries, it pointed out.  A study on 92 pregnant women in Gambia by LSHTM showed that every extra degree Celsius in extreme heat stress caused a 17 per cent increase in strain on the foetus, specifically by raising fetal heart rate and slowing blood flow through the umbilical cord.  Another study showed a macro-level association between climate change vulnerability and women and children's health (WCH) at the district level in India, as districts that had high levels of climate change vulnerability also performed poorly in WCH. ''Climate change impacts pregnancy in women through both direct and indirect pathways. The common direct pathways include heat exposure, storms, floods, drought, wildfires and air pollution. Indirect pathways include food insecurity, water or food borne diseases, vector borne diseases, migration, conflict and health system resilience,'' said Dr Bonell. Despite the growing body of evidence linking the effects of climate change with maternal and newborn health, its impact remains politically under-appreciated, the report highlighted.  Pregnancy and newborn health are often prioritised below other health concerns, and environmental impacts on maternal and newborn health have rarely drawn the attention or resources of policy-makers and implementers. Speaking at the IMNHC conference hosted by the Government of South Africa and AlignMNH in Cape Town recently, Dr Anshu Banerjee, Director, Department of Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health and Ageing at the World Health Organisation (WHO) urged governments to begin a dialogue with representatives of women and community groups, health workers associations, and other stakeholders to identify and address their needs, drawing on a range of behavioural, health systems, policy, health and environmental solutions. Dr Banerjee underlined that the health sector needs to play a dual role by building intrinsic climate resilience by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and at the same time this transition should not come at the expense of the quality of care, and patients and health workers' own health and wellbeing. Noting that women and vulnerable newborns are at risk from siloed approaches, the report said government and multi-partner efforts are needed to overcome the fragmentation between sectors.

Wade overturn.  Chloe, from Arizona, was 23 weeks pregnant with her second child when she was told the baby had a condition known as alobar holoprosencephaly - a disorder which prevents the brain from dividing into two halves.  Following the Supreme Court's decision, which ended the constitutional right to abortion, her doctor refused to induce her so she could give birth early.  Chloe was forced to carry her pregnancy to term and spent less than two days with the newborn, who had facial deformities, before the youngster passed away.  Chloe, from Arizona, was 23 weeks pregnant with her second child when she was told the baby had a condition known as holoprosencephaly - a disorder which prevents the brain from dividing into two halves  Chloe was forced to carry her pregnancy to term and spent less than two days with the newborn, who had facial deformities, before the youngster passed away  Chloe, who did not wish to disclose her last name, already had a six-month-old daughter when she found out she was pregnant in January 2022.  The young mom had been excited to find out she was having another girl but was stopped in her tracks following a routine ultrasound at 21 weeks.  Doctors identified some 'red flags' and she was transferred to a specialist who diagnosed her unborn baby with the most severe type of holoprosencephaly at 23 weeks and four days.  She was told that, as a result, the pregnancy would likely be a stillbirth, or that her child would not survive long afterwards due to difficulty breathing and eating independently.  The devastating revelation hit Chloe hard and she was presented with three options.  These were to either continue with the pregnancy, obtain an abortion in Arizona before 24 weeks (which was permitted at the time), or to travel out of state for abortion care.  But it was at this time that the Roe v. Wade verdict was overturned by the US Supreme Court in Washington which meant individual states would be allowed to dictate abortion access.  Arizona imposed a 15-week abortion ban with exemptions only for pregnancies which would 'create serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function' to a mother.  Following the Supreme Court's decision, which ended the constitutional right to abortion, her doctor refused to induce her so she could give birth early  Chloe gave birth to her daughter, who she named Laila, after several days of 'active labor' and a 24-hour-long induction  Chloe said that following the ruling doctors refused to induce her early despite previous conversations that had already taken place.  She told Good Morning America: 'When [my doctor] told me, I couldn't even get any words out... I just felt so stuck.'  The young mom had then planned to travel out of state to receive abortion care elsewhere but said that her appointment was canceled following threats made to the clinic by protestors at the time.  Chloe was left with no option and was forced to go through with the pregnancy.  She struggled with the emotional toll and was treated for anxiety and depressive disorder.  Chloe gave birth to her daughter, who she named Laila, after several days of 'active labor' and a 24-hour-long induction.  The newborn, who had facial disfigurements including a cleft lip, 'came out crying' but Chloe said: 'We could tell that her breathing was off, that it just wasn't normal.'  Chloe was left with no option and was forced to go through with the pregnancy - she struggled with the emotional toll and was treated for anxiety and depressive disorder  Heartbreakingly, Chloe was told not to feed her baby - as there was a risk of choking - and Laila's condition deteriorated quickly  Heartbreakingly, Chloe was told not to feed her baby - as there was a risk of choking - and Laila's condition deteriorated quickly.  'She was alive for about 44 hours... it was definitely hard to watch her just be in pain the whole entire time,' Chloe told the publication, before adding: 'When I think about it, I think about how I could tell that she was struggling.  'I think about how she would scream as loud as she could because she could not eat.'  'It's definitely hard to think about just because there's so much I wanted to do for her, but I couldn't,' she continued.  'I knew that if I would have done these things, it would have just prolonged her life and her suffering at the same time.'  Chloe, who was diagnosed with postpartum depression following Laila's birth, candidly said that if she found herself in the same situation again, her first choice would still be to terminate the pregnancy.  She concluded: 'Seeing what I've seen, it's not fair, and it wasn't fair from the beginning, to her or to me.'","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9mZW1haWwvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMjA5OTgzNS9Nb3RoZXItMjItcmV2ZWFscy1oZWFydGJyZWFraW5nLWhvdXJzLXNwZW50LW5ld2Jvcm4tZGF1Z2h0ZXIuaHRtbNIBeWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9mZW1haWwvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMjA5OTgzNS9hbXAvTW90aGVyLTIyLXJldmVhbHMtaGVhcnRicmVha2luZy1ob3Vycy1zcGVudC1uZXdib3JuLWRhdWdodGVyLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The 17-year-old, identified in court documents by her initials ""L.B.,"" will not attend her graduation, according to the American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi.  L.B. and her parents, Samantha Brown and Henry Brown, filed the federal lawsuit Thursday demanding Harrison County School District allow the teen to wear what she wishes during Saturday's graduation ceremony from Harrison Central High School.  Attorneys with the ACLU of Mississippi are representing the family.  The Browns cited a violation of their child's civil rights, accusing the school district of discrimination on the basis of sex and gender and violating the teen's First Amendment rights, according to the complaint.  The teen had picked out a dress and heels to wear with the traditional cap and gown in accordance with the school's dress code for female students, according to a media release from the ACLU.  ""Our client is being shamed and humiliated for explicitly discriminatory reasons, and her family is being denied a once-in-a-lifetime milestone in their daughter's life,"" ACLU spokesperson Gillian Branstetter told CNN in an email. ""No one should be forced to miss their graduation simply because of who they are.""  The Harrison County School District's policy on graduation states: ""Students are expected to wear dress shoes, dress clothes (dresses or dressy pant-suit for girls and dress pants, shirt, and tie for the boys)."" The policy does not mention dress code rules for LGBTQ students or specify students must dress according to their sex assigned at birth.  ""The Board further finds and determines that a high school graduation ceremony is a sacred and inspirational ritual which is intended to be surrounded with decorum of dignity, grace, solemnity, reverence, pomp and circumstance,"" the school policy states, according to court documents. ""Students whose attire does not meet the minimum dress requirements may not be allowed to participate in the graduation exercises.""  A commencement participation agreement is included within the court documents. It shows L.B. and her mother signed the document on March 14, 2023, agreeing to follow conditions required for participating in the graduation ceremony, the court documents show.  ""My graduation is supposed to be a moment of pride and celebration and school officials want to turn it into a moment of humiliation and shame,"" L.B. said in the release. ""The clothing I've chosen is fully appropriate for the ceremony and the superintendent's objections to it are entirely unfair to myself, my family, and all transgender students like me. I have the right to celebrate my graduation as who I am, not who anyone else wants me to be.""  The student has been openly transgender since she began attending the school as a freshman, according to the complaint, and her identity has been known to her classmates, teachers and administrators.  Mitchell King, the superintendent of Harrison County School District, testified in court documents the district relies on birth certificates to record whether students are male or female.  The complaint describes a phone conversation between Samantha Brown and King, in which King says L.B. ""is still a boy,"" therefore ""he needs to wear pants, socks, and shoes, like a boy.""  The complaint also notes L.B. attended the school's prom last year wearing a formal dress and high-heeled shoes, without any issues or repercussions.  CNN has reached out to the Harrison County School District and Harrison Central High School for comment. Graduation ceremonies are slated for 6:30 p.m. CT Saturday, according to the district's official website.  (The-CNN-Wire & 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

"birth","1960-05-09","Not Discerned","{""SaintLouis"", ""Missouri"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T16:00:00","The Food and Drug Administration is considering allowing birth-control pills to be sold without a prescription. Some conservatives are raising predictable objections, but others appear to grasp the obvious: If the anti-abortion-rights movement truly is motivated solely by a desire to prevent abortions, without a broader agenda of imposing religious dogma or subjugating women, its adherents should be the loudest voices for making reliable birth control as easily accessible as possible.  The start of the sexual revolution is often pegged to a single date — May 9, 1960 — which is when the FDA approved sale of the prescription oral contraceptive Enovid, over fervent objections of religious leaders and political conservatives. The Pill, as society quickly dubbed it, was initially illegal in many states, and even where it could be sold, prescriptions were generally available only to married women. The specter of separating sex from procreation was viewed by many as a harbinger of moral decay. In reality, it would usher in vast new opportunities for women to pursue personal and professional lives free of the ever-present threat of unplanned pregnancy.  After 63 years, the FDA is finally giving its first-ever consideration of approval for an over-the-counter birth-control pill (the French-made Opill). It's late in coming by global standards. More than 100 countries already allow over-the-counter oral contraceptives. America's continued prescription requirement is less the result of medical necessity than political trepidation. When a Supreme Court justice officially muses, as Clarence Thomas did in his concurring opinion in last year's reversal of Roe v. Wade, that perhaps contraception, too, should lose its constitutional protection, it's clear that at least some of the culture remains mired in the misogynist past.  But unlike the continuing debate over abortion rights, there are encouraging signs that the re-emergence of birth-control pills in the national conversation won't spawn the same entrenchment from the right that it did generations ago. While a statement from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops ""strenuously"" opposing easier access to the pill was predictable enough, others who are fully engaged in the fight to end abortion rights appear to be sitting this one out. The National Right to Life organization told The Washington Post it ""does not take a stance on anything that prevents fertilization."" Even as red states like Iowa and Indiana are passing draconian new abortion restrictions, they are simultaneously expanding birth-control availability.  We would argue that abortion rights and easily accessible birth control share a common imperative: allowing women to make their own reproductive choices, free of governmental coercion in this most private of topics. But those who seek to end abortion rights should at least recognize their own special obligation to expand rather than close off other avenues of choice. To the extent that's happening, it's a bright spot in this otherwise darkening era for women.

"birth","2006-07-08","Not Discerned","{""Helena"", ""Montana"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T13:00:00","What do you think about when you hear the word ""adoption?""  Hopefully, the first thought to cross your mind is the joy that comes from it. Unfortunately, and all too often, the pervasive example of the classic orphanage you see in movies or plays, such as in “Annie,” is the first thing to pop into someone’s mind. If you have seen what I am referencing, you know exactly what I am talking about. Dirty, dingy buildings with stacks of bunkbeds as far as the eye can see. Children of all ages down on their hands and knees scrubbing the floors and being lined up like cattle for a couple to arrive to “shop” for them.  I am pleased to let you know that this is definitively no longer the case. I will revisit this later in this article and will speak primarily of the adoption of infants.  As I am sure you know, the Holy Family is the most notable example of adoption. After all, Joseph, known as St. Joseph to Catholics and various other Christian denominations, was the adopted father of Jesus. In the Gospel of Matthew, God appeared to St. Joseph in a dream and told him to take Mary and the child she carried in her womb, Jesus, into his home.  What a calling!  Talk about trusting in God and his plan, and what an example of adoption and family, as St. Joseph undertook a lifelong mission to support and protect Mary and Jesus, just like many adoptive couples do in the modern day.  At its core, adoption is a selfless act of love. The birth mother experiences everything that comes along with a pregnancy and subsequent adoption. The ups and downs, the stresses on her emotional and physical health, the strain on her relationships and living situation, the difficulties that come with giving the child she just carried to the adoptive couple — it's an incredible and selfless love for the life she took part in creating.  She chooses to endure those trials to protect and give her child the best life possible. Likewise, the adoptive couple goes through weeks of training, mountains of paperwork and the emotional challenges of bringing a child into their home, still choosing to receive and selflessly love, protect and provide for the child they raise to adulthood in their newly expanded family. The selfless act of love for the child from the birth mother and the adoptive couple is a celebration of the human life they now each share a piece of — how joyous!  You may ask what I mean by sharing. The answer is best summarized by a quote I found a while back from an adoptive mother who had adopted a child years ago that said, “He is mine in a way that will never be hers. He is hers in a way that will never be mine, and together we are motherhood.”  Nowadays, the common agreed-upon best practice for completing an adoption is referred to as open adoption. In an open adoption, the birth mother and the adoptive couple make the decision to give the birth mother a relationship with her biological child, helping give the child the benefit of knowing where it came from and that its adoption was an absolute act of love. I am also happy to hear about birth mothers who are around for the biological child’s significant milestones, such as birthdays, graduations, etc.  Pretty neat!  While there are many minutiae involved in open adoption and everything I have described above, overall, it is a wonderful way to love and care for the child.  As loving as the adoption option is, it is difficult and conceived to be too expensive for families to reasonably pursue.  Good news: It is not.  In Montana, there are adoption agencies that firmly believe in the adoption option, dedicate large portions of their service offerings to it, and are committed to keeping prices as affordable as possible for adoptive couples.  During the recent legislative session in Helena, I had the opportunity to meet with several legislators to discuss adoption, and upon asking them how much they thought an adoption within the borders of Montana cost to complete, was shocked to hear answers as high as $60,000! In reality, it is a fraction of that. Additionally, the governor worked with legislators to pass a bill providing credits to Montana couples who adopt, making it even more affordable.  The new credit, which is refundable, provides $5,000 for couples adopting an infant and $7,500 for couples adopting a child currently in the foster care system. This will serve as an incredible gift to couples hoping to adopt, encouraging the pro-family values we as Montanans tend to hold universally and providing families for the children who could benefit from being adopted.  As a reminder, at its core, adoption is a selfless act of love to care for, provide for, and protect a child’s life. Please pray for all the expectant mothers, birth mothers, adoptive couples, children, and social workers who were, are, and will be a part of an adoption.  It truly is beautiful. God bless.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFodHRwczovL2hlbGVuYWlyLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2NvbHVtbmlzdHMvbWF0dGVycy1vZi1mYWl0aC1zY290dC1oZWxkLWFkb3B0aW9uLWlzLWEtYmVhdXRpZnVsLWxvdmluZy1vcHRpb24vYXJ0aWNsZV80ODJjZjI1NC1mNGJmLTExZWQtOTE0MS1hNzdmYzVhZjU1MWMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

A British man finally met his long-lost brother this month, thanks to a MyHeritage at-home DNA test.  Rhys Williams, 27, was just 9 when his mom passed away. It wasn’t until his cousins revealed that the man raising him was not his biological father that Williams decided to dig into his family tree — without any luck.  Williams finally ran a DNA test in January 2022, publishing his results on MyHeritage.com. While his birth father had passed away six years earlier, a match came up for a sibling: Chris Jones, 53.  Williams connected with Jones for the first time on Zoom via an aunt.  Rhys Williams said it was difficult to discover their father’s death, but meeting his long-lost brother was “meant to be.” MyHeritage / SWNS  The sweet in-person surprise was described by Chris Jones as “a lovely moment.” MyHeritage / SWNS  He said it was “crazy” to meet his long-lost brother in May after learning the heartbreaking news that their father is dead.  After laying eyes on Jones, who is more than 20 years his senior, Williams knows he “will have a very good hairline” as he ages.  “This is someone who is flesh and blood — who looks like me,” Williams told SWNS.  “It feels like another piece of the puzzle is filled in,” added the university lecturer from Staffordshire, England. “The puzzle started as big question mark, but it is getting filled in now.”  Virtual hangouts weren’t enough for Jones. He drove more than two hours from Oxfordshire for a surprise meeting, with Williams under the impression a videographer was visiting to hear his unique story.  Their biological father passed a few years ago. MyHeritage / SWNS  Jones surprised Williams by driving more than two hours to unite for the first time in person. MyHeritage / SWNS  “I drove up there and had to send the cameraman a secret message to tell him I was there,” Jones explained. “I sent him a text saying, ‘I am delivering your camera batteries,’ and then he came to the door, and I went in the house to surprise Rhys.”  Williams had “no idea,” embracing his older brother when Jones appeared in his living room.  “It was a lovely moment,” said Jones, adding that the pair “get on really well.”  Williams had no clue that the man raising him was not his biological father. MyHeritage / SWNS  Jones knew he was adopted while growing up as an only child. MyHeritage / SWNS  Jones, who works as a global logistics buyer, grew up as an only child, but knew he was adopted.  While he had a “good upbringing,” he wished this meeting happened earlier.  “It is nice. It is lovely how it has all happened now,” Jones said. “I have never had a younger brother. It is a different experience.”  The brothers share a number of physical traits, but even “things that aren’t genetic,” such as certain interests, are eerily similar, Williams said.  Oddly enough, their birth father and Jones suffered a similar rare eye injury.  On MyHeritage.com, Williams got a match for his half-brother: Jones. MyHeritage / SWNS  At 18, Williams decided to figure out his ancestry, discovering the identity of his birth father, pictured here. MyHeritage / SWNS  “We both like the same color. We both love cats. We both decide to make impulse purchases,” he explained. “Things like that. Things you don’t even realize but, obviously, there is a lot of genetics.”  After their celebratory meeting, they are planning to see each other again in June.  “It feels like this is the time it was meant to be, and now it has happened,” Williams gushed.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzIwL2ktdG9vay1hLWRuYS10ZXN0LWFuZC1tZXQtbXktbG9uZy1sb3N0LWJyb3RoZXItYXQtMjcv0gFXaHR0cHM6Ly9ueXBvc3QuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMjAvaS10b29rLWEtZG5hLXRlc3QtYW5kLW1ldC1teS1sb25nLWxvc3QtYnJvdGhlci1hdC0yNy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act was passed by Parliament in 2018 to secure the fundamental rights of transgender Pakistanis. It ensures their access to legal gender recognition, among other rights.  Many Pakistanis have entrenched beliefs on gender and sexuality and transgender people are often considered outcasts. Some are forced into begging, dancing and even prostitution to earn money. They also live in fear of attacks.  The Federal Shariat Court on Friday struck down several provisions of the landmark law, terming them “un-Islamic.”  It ruled that a person cannot change their gender on the basis of “innermost feeling” or “self-perceived identity” and must conform to the biological sex assigned to them at the time of birth.  The Shariah court has the constitutional mandate of examining and determining whether laws passed by Pakistan's parliament comply with Islamic doctrine.  Around a dozen activists protested in the southern port city of Karachi on Saturday against the ruling.  Lawyer Sara Malkani, who was speaking at an event organized by the Gender Interactive Alliance, denied the legislation was un-Islamic. She said the existence of two genders did not limit the concept of gender identity and that Islamic texts, including the Quran, did not associate specific behavior to specific genders.  “We absolutely intend to appeal the court’s findings to the Supreme Court, and we will prevail,” said Nayyab Ali, executive director of Transgender Rights Consultants Pakistan, at a news conference Friday.  Ali said the transgender community was “mourning the decimation"" of Pakistan’s first transgender rights protection legislation in response to the Islamic court's finding.  However, clerics and representatives from religious parties say the law has the potential to promote homosexuality in this conservative country with a Muslim majority. They want the Islamic court to annul the law.  The Shariah court ruled that the term “transgender” as it is used in the law creates confusion. It covers several biological variations, including intersex, transgender men, transgender women and Khawaja Sira, a Pakistani term commonly used for those who were born male but identify as female.  It also rejected a clause in the law in which the country’s national database and registration authority permits the change of a person’s biological gender from the one they were assigned at birth in identification documents including drivers licenses and passports.  It said permitting any person to change their gender in accordance with his or her inner feeling or self-perceived identity will create “serious religious, legal and social problems.”  For example it will allow a transgender woman — a person who is biologically male — to access social and religious gatherings of females or women-only public places, and vice versa, it said.  “This law will pave the way for criminals in society to easily commit crimes like sexual molestation, sexual assault and even rape against females in the disguise of a transgender woman,” the court ruled.  However, the court said Islamic law recognizes the existence of intersex people and eunuchs and said they should be entitled to all the fundamental rights provided to Pakistanis in the constitution.  The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan expressed dismay over the “regressive ruling” and said the denial of transgender people's rights to self-perceived gender identity seeks the “erasure of an entire demographic and its fundamental rights.” It said rolling back the transgender bill will lead to further marginalization and abuse of an already vulnerable community in Pakistan.  Amnesty International called on the government to stop any attempts to prevent transgender people from obtaining official documents reflecting their gender identity without complying with abusive and invasive requirements.  “This verdict is a blow to the rights of the already beleaguered group of transgender and gender-diverse people in Pakistan,” said Rehab Mahamoor, research assistant at Amnesty International, in a statement.  She said any steps to deny transgender and gender-diverse people the right to determine their own gender identity would violate international human rights law.  Sana, 40, a eunuch in Rawalpindi who asked to be identified by one name, told The Associated Press on Saturday that she favored the court’s ruling because a large number of gay men were being included in her “original and by-birth” eunuch community.  She alleged that those who become transgender men through surgical castration are “denying the rights” of her community by affecting their access to employment opportunities under the government’s job quota reserved for their community.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vSW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC93aXJlU3RvcnkvcGFraXN0YW5pLXRyYW5zZ2VuZGVyLWFjdGl2aXN0cy1hcHBlYWwtc2hhcmlhaC1jb3VydC1ydWxpbmctbGF3LTk5NDc4MTMw0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly9hYmNuZXdzLmdvLmNvbS9hbXAvSW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC93aXJlU3RvcnkvcGFraXN0YW5pLXRyYW5zZ2VuZGVyLWFjdGl2aXN0cy1hcHBlYWwtc2hhcmlhaC1jb3VydC1ydWxpbmctbGF3LTk5NDc4MTMw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

This incident highlights the evident lack of coordination between the district health officer and the staff at the primary health centre.  According to the available details, the expectant woman was transported to the primary health centre on a two-wheeler. However, due to a delay in transferring her to a ward on the first floor, she ended up giving birth to her child on the steps of the facility.  According to Dr. Harshal Nehete, the District Health Officer, the woman was transported to the health centre in an ambulance. Due to the occurrence of floods in Chandori, the health centre had been relocated to the first floor. Recognizing the risk of the woman delivering while being moved to the first floor, an emergency operation was performed inside the ambulance before she was transferred to the first floor.  Upon initial investigation, it was discovered that the facts presented were contradictory to the narrative. The health office subsequently verified that the woman had actually been brought to the facility on a two-wheeler. In order to gather accurate information, the health officer appointed an impartial staff member to conduct an independent investigation and requested a report from them.  As per the investigation report, when the pregnant woman arrived at the Chandori health centre, she faced difficulty in ascending the stairs to the first floor. Experiencing intense pain, she began screaming loudly. Meanwhile, the doctors and staff on the first floor were occupied with treating other patients.

According to figures from NHS Herefordshire and Worcestershire since April 2022 the number of women who smoke when their baby is born has fallen in Herefordshire and Worcestershire from 10.8 per cent to 8.8 per cent, which is just below the England average of 8.9 per cent.  In Worcestershire, a unique Stop Smoking in Pregnancy Service is offered within Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust.  A team of dedicated stop-smoking advisors are available to support pregnant women and families in their home with one-to-one behavioural support and free nicotine replacement therapy.  Speaking anonymously, the county mum-to-be said she had been smoking since she was 14 years old and was smoking roll ups at the start of her pregnancy.      “I had tried quitting in the past with support from a practice nurse and using refillable vapes but was unable to quit,” she said. “When I found out I was pregnant I did try and reduce smoking but couldn’t cut it out completely.  After speaking to her midwife, she was referred to the service and could ‘tell straight away’ it was a different approach to previous bids to quit. “I felt the appointment was personal and I wasn’t just a number in a line of people to be seen,” she said. “I set my quit date for two weeks later and tried reducing first. “My stop smoking advisor was due to go away and I decided I wanted to have quit by the time she came back so decided to bring my quit date forward. “I am now 38 weeks pregnant and have been quit for 182 days.

She took to her social media to share,  “Last night I was lucky enough to see a screening of Max Lugavere and Chris Newhard’s new documentary, Little Empty Boxes. Max chronicles his mother Kathy’s battle with dementia while he educates himself on everything he can do to help her. His love for his mother is powerful. His motivation to find answers from leading health experts is inspiring and then being so gracious to share that information is a true blessing.”  The entrepreneur lastly added, “Thank you Max for being so brave and vulnerable to share the journey and spotlighting the importance of brain health.” Emma Heming continued to say that when one lives in the world of dementia, they know that the ‘options are slim’ including that some are unwilling to leave that lying down which is how the changes within society are made and she was thankful that she witnessed one such story with Little Empty Boxes.

India has become a global leader in phone manufacturing, with Xiaomi boasting that 99% of its phones are produced here. As the company unveils its most affordable product in India – the Redmi A2 – we got a chance to visit one of its factories and witness what goes on at the assembly line.  The Xiaomi Bawal plant is located at the edge of the NCR. (Image: Zohaib Ahmed/Indian Express) The Xiaomi Bawal plant is located at the edge of the NCR. (Image: Zohaib Ahmed/Indian Express)  Nestled at the edge of the National Capital Region near Gurgaon, the factory lies in the industrial town of Bawal. As I got off the bus into the scorching heat, I was reminded how close we were to Rajasthan, the predominantly desert state. We were first taken to the factory’s SMT (Surface Mount Technology) plant where we were asked to put on factory overalls and shoe covers before we were gently frisked – a part of the routine hundreds of workers here follow daily.  The SMT plant was quite large with endless lines of machines whirring and beeping as they processed hundreds of PCBs (printed circuit boards) every hour. For those unaware, Surface Mount Technology is the method used to mount electrical components directly onto a PCB.  A worker examines a PCB that makes up the motherboard of the Redmi A2. (Image: Zohaib Ahmed/Indian Express) A worker examines a PCB that makes up the motherboard of the Redmi A2. (Image: Zohaib Ahmed/Indian Express)  Workers’ roles here looked simple – loading PCBs into the machine and ensuring that every unit was in order before being fed to the next machine. The heavy lifting, such as soldering and pasting the various components on the board, were handled by the machinery.  Scanning for any irregularities. (Image: Zohaib Ahmed/ Scanning for any irregularities. (Image: Zohaib Ahmed/ Indian Express  Obviously, since the entire factory is an assembly plant rather than a proper manufacturing unit, most of the tiny components came wrapped in transparent packages and were not actually produced here. The job of the SMT plant was to simply assemble these.  The next stop was the assembly plant, where finished components like cameras, motherboards, batteries, and displays were put together. In contrast to the SMT plant, where most of the processes were automated due to their intricacy and the size of the components, the assembly plant sees a far greater human input. On both sides of the worktops, workers aligned in rows and fitted the components in rhythmic coordination. They hardly spoke to each other, probably to keep productivity at the maximum.  Inside the assembly plant at the Inside the assembly plant at the Xiaomi Bawal factory. (Image: Zohaib Ahmed/Indian Express)  The workers wore red armbands that indicated their roles and the components they handled. Occasionally, a “Team Leader” armband would be seen patrolling the rows, ready to help the junior workers when needed.  Advertisement  The camera assembly enclosure. (Image: Zohaib Ahmed/Indian Express) The camera assembly enclosure. (Image: Zohaib Ahmed/Indian Express)  The camera assembly procedure captivated me the most. The camera module is a complex component of a mobile phone, with multiple lenses that cooperate to capture crisp images. To assemble it, a special enclosure is needed. The factory tour guide informed IndianExpress.com that the enclosure was designed to be dust-free. Humidifiers inside run continuously to keep dust “settled” so none gets into the lenses.  Assembled phones going through the treacherous “ageing test.” (Image: Zohaib Ahmed/Indian Express) Assembled phones going through the treacherous “ageing test.” (Image: Zohaib Ahmed/Indian Express)  Another process that was particularly fascinating to watch was the “ageing test.” Assembled phones were tested for six hours in a dedicated room to check their hardware performance. Hardware obviously includes speakers, and for that, every phone’s speaker unit is kept running continuously at max volume. You can imagine what scores of phones blasting audio at the same time in a closed space would sound like. The man in charge of the ageing test wore protective gear to preserve his hearing. I could barely last for 5 minutes in the room, the piercing noise was just too much to handle.  Towards the far left, a tumbling machine puts the Redmi A2’s build quality to the test.

I was surprised to see a whole room dedicated to this process, with a host of equipment designed to rigorously test the phone’s build before it’s given the green light for mass production. One machine here tumbled a Redmi A2 unit over and over again probably to emulate the phone rolling down a hill.  Advertisement  The Redmi A2, fresh out of the bakery.

"birth","2022-07-08","Not Discerned","{""Armagh"", ""Armagh"", ""UnitedKingdom""}","2023-05-20T18:50:17","Austin McKenna in action for the Armagh Masters. Photos by Colin Molloy Sports Photography  ‘No chance!’ That was the initial response to a proud Armagh man who was asked to don the jersey of arch-rivals Tyrone for their Masters team last season.  Austin McKenna is a proud Blackwatertown man – and is proud of his local GAA club, An Port Mor, so much so he returned home – having spent 21 years in the US – with his young family about 18 months ago.  He has won his fair share of championships stateside but it was fair to say his playing days – at senior level at least – were behind him, or so he thought.  That was until he received a message to play for the Tyrone Masters side in 2022. The GAA Masters is an inter-county set-up for players 40 and above. The initiative, which is not affiliated with the Official GAA, was set up as a way to keep older men active in the game.  For Austin, who is 44, it has provided a great opportunity – even if his first foray into the Masters series was for the enemy!  “I got a random WhatsApp from the Tyrone manager, this time last year, asking if I would play with Tyrone,” Austin explained.  “I’m a big Armagh man so I was like ‘no chance’. I was looking at it and thought, I can’t play for Tyrone and I sort of said no. Them I took a bit of time and I thought it about again and said to myself ‘what am I doing’, so I messaged him back and said, ‘you know what, I will play, thanks for reaching out’.  “I went and started training; their season was almost over so I sort of came in at the end but I loved it, it was deadly good standard, all the fellas were around the same age, same way of thinking, I just thought it was brilliant.”  Tyrone reached and subsequently won the All-Ireland final – their second in a row. Austin became an All-Ireland winner…with Tyrone.  Said Austin: “On the day of the All-Ireland final, I was sitting in the changing room with the Tyrone jersey on and I was thinking how lethal would this be if it was Armagh.  “After it was over I just knew Armagh needed to have a team. There’s a good buzz about Armagh at the minute too. I reached out to a few lads – Chris Rafferty and Brian McGeary. Once we sort of got talking, it gained traction really quickly; there was serious interest.  “We now have 60 on the WhatsApp group, and so far we’ve played two challenge games and our first league game (against Louth) and we’ve won all easily. We’ve a good team and we play Tyrone in two weeks which will be a big test against the All-Ireland champions.”  Tyrone currently boast players like Sean Cavanagh, Steven O’Neill, Ciaran Gourley and Conor Gormley. That quartet alone has 12 All-Ireland medals between them.  While the competitive nature of the competition is evident it’s a game open to all who turn 40 this year and above.  If you turn 40 this year, you can play. There aren’t many around that age that play – it’s more the older 40s. We’ve a decent team.  “There are teams that are there for the craic, there are teams that are sort of semi-serious and then you have teams like Tyrone and Dublin who are really serious,” explained Austin. “We’re probably closer to the latter than the other two.  “But there’s a place for everyone. Our team, you have good players, then you have another group maybe not as strong and then you have a group that are there for the craic, that’s the good thing about it, it’s still really social. It’s open to anyone which is brilliant.  “The only county stacked with ex-players is Tyrone but it’s not like that with any of the other counties. We have a few in our WhatsApp group but it’s about them getting time.  “While we wouldn’t have household names there are lot of players who have played at a really good standard at club and underage levels.”  Armagh are currently in a round-robin group alongside Louth, Down, Donegal, Tyrone, Leitrim/Longford and Antrim.  Austin says Armagh will harbour ambitions of winning all those games – even Tyrone who they face next.  “That’s the big one coming up,” said Austin. “Tyrone are All-Ireland champions, we’re in our first year; we’ve both won our first game and the interest is building. Hopefully people can get behind it and really bring it on.”  That game is to be played in Eglish, which straddles the two counties. It’s to take place on Saturday, May 27 at 7.45pm. While it’s a close clash with Armagh’s All-Ireland game against Westmeath in the Athletic Grounds (4.45pm throw-in) Austin is hopeful it gives people a chance to watch both.  While in its infancy, the Armagh Masters team are really building up a head of steam as they aim to emulate their neighbours in picking up major honours.  They currently look the part anyway. Paudi McKeever, of McKeever Sports, is a big supporter of Armagh GAA and likewise the Masters side for which he too plays.  “Having him on board has been brilliant. He has supplied us with gear and it’s class. We’re coming and looking like a proper county team. His input has been brilliant both on and off the field.”  Tyrone vs Armagh, Saturday, May 27, Eglish, 7.45pm throw-in.  Armagh Masters would like to thank its sponsors: M.Toner Electrical; Allied Fleet Services; Mamo Construction/Millview Windows; CK Rafferty; JH Tyres and McKeever Sports.

The NPC Director of Vital Registration Department, Mr. Mathew Sunday, disclosed this in Lagos during the opening a two-day workshop on the operational plans for digital birth registration in the state organised by NPC Lagos office in collaboration with United Nation Children’s Fund (UNICEF).  He said the commission plans to register 8.08m children in 22 priority states and 4.62m in other states with the application of the digitisation.  He said this would significantly increase the percentage of children with birth certificates which currently stands at 33%.  We spent N200bn on preparations for 2023 census – NPC  Census: We are ready, awaiting Tinubu’s order – NPC  According to him, the situation is worse in the rural area with 32 % of the total number of children with birth certificates while the urban areas have 63 %.  He disclosed that the NPC moved from 47 percent registration of under five children in 2018 to 57 in 2021 which he described as having a huge impact in the CRVS data but said only 33% actually have birth certificates.  “For us to have a complete registration of children, there must be certification and until one is issued a certificate, that is when we can say one has been registered,” he said.  He said birth registration data is critical to planning by any government and said there would be an aggressive campaign to mobilise the citizenry on the import of birth registration.  “We will go on an aggressive social mobilisation in collaboration with stakeholders, especially the National Orientation Agency (NOA). A greater percentage of our population don’t know there is what we call birth registration,” Sunday said.  A child protection specialist with UNICEF, Sharon Oladiji, said part of UNICEF’s mandate is to support the government towards realising the rights of children.  She said the fund would go to 22 states which she did not disclose to deepen the birth registration drive for Under-5 children.  On his part, the state Director of NPC, Mr. Bamidele Sadiku, explained that the NPC has concluded plans to move away from analogue registration of birth, saying, “Birth registration is so unique and important. It is the first right to give to any child. Right of identity, right of living and so many other rights would be built on that and we want to reduce the stress from the process, that is the essence of digitisation. We want to reduce the time it takes to register a child.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHl0cnVzdC5jb20vZmctbW92ZXMtdG8tZGlnaXRpc2UtYmlydGgtcmVnaXN0cmF0aW9uLXRhcmdldHMtMTItNzJtLWNoaWxkcmVuLWluLTIwMjPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"birth","2023-11-30","Not Discerned","{""FortLauderdale"", ""Florida"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T00:01:42","At just five months old, Alanie Lettsome had his first graduation Friday, his blue gown and cap laid next to his head on the pillow he peacefully slept serving as a testament to the odds he overcame.  Alanie was born on Nov. 30 at Broward Health Medical Center at 23 weeks gestation. His mother, Graysel Stuart, flew to Fort Lauderdale three days earlier from Saint Thomas to give birth to the boy after learning she was at high risk of delivering early, the hospital said in a news release.  The baby weighed one pound, one ounce. The medical team told Stuart of the risks Alanie faced, mentally preparing her for the possible complications to come, the release said.  The final weeks of pregnancy are needed for babies’ brain, lungs and liver to fully develop, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Even 35 weeks is still too early as a baby’s brain is still growing and developing.  A pregnancy is considered full term at 39 weeks. Babies born before 32 weeks have higher death and disability rates, according to the CDC. Those who survive may suffer vision, hearing, feeding or breathing difficulties, developmental delay and cerebral palsy, affecting his or her mobility.  Dr. Johny Tryzmel, who specializes in neonatology and pediatrics, said babies born as early as Alanie have about a 30% chance of survival. Stuart gave birth at barely halfway through her pregnancy.  Because of his underdeveloped lungs, Alanie’s tiny body was attached to a ventilator after his birth, Tryzmel said. Alanie also needed nutritional support, having a tube through his throat and into his stomach to feed him milk, and support to regulate his body temperature.  After a month or so, Alanie was removed from the ventilator and no longer intubated, Tryzmel said. A CPAP machine helped him breathe for another few months.  Alanie did not suffer from some of the complications other extremely premature babies often can — bleeding brains and intestinal issues, Tryzmel said. His MRIs were normal, his doctor said.  He went home needing no help eating or breathing, and though “a little smaller,” the doctor said, “he will catch up.”  “The great thing is he went home, he went home with nothing,” Tryzmel said. “Like you or me.”  The MRIs showed no issues with his brain, and Tryzmel said Alanie will likely be able to develop normally.  Stuart created a scrapbook of Alanie’s progress while at the hospital, an hour-long weekly program in the NICU, the news release said.  “I have seen some very meaningful connections take place in these sessions,” Broward Health’s NICU family support coordinator Caitlin Collin said in the release. “Moms will often share with other mothers about their baby’s birth and postpartum issues they are facing, and I have even seen some parents become friends that keep in touch after the NICU.”  Not only Alanie needed support. The psychological toll on the baby’s mother and family requires help, too, Tryzmel said. His was not a birth where he and his mother were home together in a matter of days.  “Here, it’s not happening. It’s a big toll,” he said. “The mom came from abroad. She was not even living in the United States. The support that we have to give to the families is really important.”  The doctor said he is proud of the team who supported not only Alanie but the whole family.  “The patient is not just the baby. The patient becomes the whole family,” he said. “My kids are my treasure and for this mom, Alanie was her treasure. Imagine when your treasure is sick in the critical setting. You really don’t know if the baby will survive or not.”  Over the 170 days at Broward Health’s Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Alanie grew to nine pounds, the release said. He was discharged Friday morning, ready for his family to take him home to the U.S Virgin Islands.  The doctor said graduation day is the one he and his team most cherish.  “I think that the journey that Alanie went through, it was not an easy road, but I will say a beautiful ending,” he said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1bi1zZW50aW5lbC5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8yMC9oZS13YXMtYm9ybi1hdC0yMy13ZWVrcy13ZWlnaGluZy1vbmUtcG91bmQtZGVzcGl0ZS1pbml0aWFsLWxvdy1vZGRzLWhlLWlzLWdvaW5nLWhvbWXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

So, the birth of tiger cubs here at the Memphis Zoo is a milestone with a worldwide impact.”  The zoo has yet to put the cubs into public view. They will receive a series of vaccinations when they are 6 weeks old, the zoo said.  Officials said the cubs will be able to explore the zoo’s outdoor exhibit when they are 3 months old.  “When Dari went into labor on the evening of May 5th, all the zookeepers were anxiously awaiting the news, and they all breathed a sigh of relief when it became readily apparent that the cubs were alive and that Dari’s maternal instincts were appropriate,” Dembiec said in a statement.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1zbi5jb20vZW4tdXMvbmV3cy91cy9tZW1waGlzLXpvby1hbm5vdW5jZXMtYmlydGgtb2YtMi1zdW1hdHJhbi10aWdlci1jdWJzL2FyLUFBMWJzb2JFP29jaWQ9d2VhdGhlci12ZXJ0aHAtZmVlZHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"birth","2023-05-20","Not Discerned","{""Saskatoon"", ""Saskatchewan"", ""Canada""}","2023-05-20T21:29:18","Trevor Harris is living up to his billing as the new franchise quarterback of the Saskatchewan Roughriders, but most of Rider Nation will have to wait a little longer than expected to see him.  Speaking to fans as part of the team’s State of the Nation panel on Saturday, head coach Craig Dickenson revealed that Harris would likely play sparingly in the team’s Green and White scrimmage and not at all during the team’s first preseason game. The majority of reps will go to the three players competing for the backup position — Mason Fine, Jake Dolegala, and Shea Patterson — for one very specific reason.  “The majority of reps today will be those three guys, the majority of reps in the first preseason game will be those three as well because our starting quarterback, Mr. Harris, is having a baby so he won’t be there for the first game,” Dickenson revealed. “That’s why he won’t be there for the first one but he will be there for the second.”  Harris is scheduled to depart from training camp ahead of the team’s preseason opener against the B.C. Lions on Saturday, May 27 in order to be with his wife for the birth of their third child. For Dickenson, his absence has a silver lining.  “The nice thing about this training camp is Trevor gets to welcome a new baby to the family and he’s gone for about four days. So those four days, we get a chance to see really what these other quarterbacks can do,” the coach explained.  “I will say with (GM Jeremy O’Day) and (president Craig Reynolds), we’ve done a deep dive into last year and really tried to dissect what went wrong and how can we learn from that. I think one thing we did learn is we do have to give our number twos and threes a little more reps, a little more action, so that if we do need them that they feel like they at least had enough practice to be successful.”  That’s been a focus for the team even while Harris has been present in Saskatoon. While the prized free agent signing is regarded as the potential catalyst for a Riders resurgence in 2023, Dickenson has been playing a difficult balancing act to ensure the 36-year-old receives enough time under centre to be successful without stunting the growth of others.  “Trevor’s already come in to meet twice and asked if he could have more reps in camp and I’ve said no both times,” he chuckled. “It’s a tricky one this year because we’ve got a new quarterback, a new offensive coordinator, a new system, so we’re going to try to give Trevor as many reps as we can to get him comfortable and at that point, we will definitely start looking at getting our number two and our number three some reps.”  Harris will have to wait until June 2nd in Winnipeg for his reps to come against real competition, but Dickenson was quick to reassure fans that the 10-year veteran has come as advertised. He has been impressive during the early portion of camp and will not suffer from a few days away.  “Trevor is as good as we thought he would be and maybe even a little better. He’s really something else,” the coach raved. “Super mature guy, understands football. You don’t have to tell him much, he’s been out there and done such a good job with game management. You don’t even have to tell him the situation, you just tell him there’s 1:30 on the clock and he already knows what we’re gonna do.”  The Riders’ other quarterbacks will kick off the exhibition action in exactly one week at 7:00 p.m. EDT at Mosaic Stadium.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vM2Rvd25uYXRpb24uY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMjAvcWItdHJldm9yLWhhcnJpcy10by1taXNzLXJpZGVycy1maXJzdC1wcmVzZWFzb24tZ2FtZS1mb3ItYmlydGgtb2YtdGhpcmQtY2hpbGQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"birth","2019-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T09:07:24","As a first time mother and the negative stories around childbirth Stella* (not real name) had heard, she needed someone, who would understand her. She needed someone to give her emotional support to face the traumatising birth journey.  Unlike women who prefer to go to the labour suite with a mother, friend, a relative or in-law, in her last trimester, she searched for organisations offering doula services in Uganda on Google. She reached out to Birth with Love.  “Before hiring a doula, I needed to confirm whether it was registered. I even asked for contacts of mothers she had worked with to get reviews on their experience,” she adds.  “A trained doula can be more supportive to a mother in labour than some of our relatives,” Stella says adding that during her time, she was monitored regularly by her doula.  She took her for simple exercises and attended hospital visits with her every time she needed to see a gynaecologist.  After delivery, they went home together and for the first two weeks, her doula took care of the baby and only gave it to her when it was time for feeding. “I needed that rest and I was happy she was there to support me in those postpartum days,” she adds.  The doula guided Stella on what to eat, supervised her shopping, was with her in the labour suite and offered her the emotional support she needed.  After all the trauma she went through, Habiba Namanda says she suffered from postpartum depression for some time. She confesses she is slowly learning to love her firstborn daughter, after going through a number of counselling sessions.  Changing the game  Before she had her second child, Namanda chanced upon the word ‘doula’, which meant ‘a woman who is employed to give guidance and support to a pregnant woman during labour.  “This caught my attention. I searched for doulas in Uganda. Unfortunately the one I found had left the country. This inspired me to pursue an online doula course with ProDoula Certified Professional doulas that lasted a year. The course enriched me with skills to support mothers overcome postpartum depression,”she explains.  After training as a doula and following the birth of her second child, in 2019, Namanda founded and registered Birth With Love Doulas and Midwifery Services, to support mothers face childbirth with love.  Namanda, who has worked as a doula for close to four years, says a doula does whatever she can to make childbirth an easy journey, where a mother in labour is loved and supported to walk the painful journey.  “As a doula, you definitely cannot control all the circumstances, but you do whatever you can to make sure the mother or rather the parents have the right information, support and encouragement they need to go through labour,” she expresses.  Namada says as a doula, a healthy baby and mother is at the top of the list of priorities.  Advocacy  Dora Mwima Barrack of World Mum Doulas, says she has been working in different initiatives to support mothers. However, she says the misdiagnosis, the unnecessary medical procedures done, without giving the expectant mother the right information, led her to this profession.  “It has been two years working as a professional doula and what I have realised is that having a doula by your side is like having that bestfriend who you can always call on to seek for advice, providing you with information that you may not find anywhere else,” she explains.  She says doulas also advocate for policies that better mother’s health care system.  “If I want a better health system, then I want it for everybody. That is why birthing women should be handled responsibly whether in the village or in town,” she says.  A doula wants a new mother to be strong and healthy physically, mentally and emotionally, and this is difficult, if she was mistreated or felt afraid or lonely during labour and birth. The doula ensures that a mother’s needs are central at every step of the journey.  Anna Verwaal, a midwife and doula says, “A woman, as long as she lives, will always remember how she was made to feel during childbirth.”  “Research shows that having a doula helps mothers to be more informed and when you are more informed you do not fear. You get to know when your service provider is not treating you right. You are enlightened with so much information that can help you have a positive birth experience. I am not saying doulas are miracle workers, but I want mothers’ birthing experience to be eased,” Mwima shares.  A woman takes a warm water bath to ease contraction pain during labour.  Drawing a birth plan and packages  Mariam Bagyenyi started the Treasure of Birth through volunteering to mothers at Kiira government Hospital. She has done this for the last three years.  “When hired, the first thing a doula does is to draw a work plan of important details about their journey to parenthood with the client,” she says.  An expectant mother together with a doula, works on a birth plan, which stipulates key preferences. From where a mother wants to deliver from, whether or not the mother is planning for a home birth, midwife-led unit, labour ward and finally, the kind of postpartum care a mother desires.  Bagyenyi says an expectant mother can book a doula from the moment she conceives because this gives more time to plan, interact, engage through antenatal and birth plans.  Namanda says prices are set according to the plan, services and trimester of a pregnancy desired by the expectant mother.  “In most cases the prices range between Shs750,000 to Shs4m. In my case, I start monitoring a mother at six months and during that time, we go together for the last antennal visit,” she says.  With no specific doula centres in the country, the doula monitors the expectant mother from her home, especially if it is what makes them comfortable. Namanda and the other doulas’ future plan is to build a birth centre that is well equipped.  “I want women to know that giving birth is not a battle field. “  Exercise to consider  There is always so much going on during labour and your doula can help with some pain relieving exercises, which can include ball bounce, gently bouncing on an exercise ball to induce labour and assist with cervix dilation. Other exercises include warm water birth, belly lifting, massages and pavement walks.  Are doulas registered?  According to Dr Jessica Nsungwa, a commissioner for reproductive , maternal and child health services at Ministry of Health , the policy allows companionship while in labour to offer assistance to the mother and midwives or doctors. So doulas come in as companions.  The difference between a midwife and a doula is that midwives provide medical care for a mother during pregnancy, birth, and the immediate postpartum period. However, doulas provide her and her family with emotional, informational, and physical support during pregnancy, birth and the immediate postpartum period.  Mwima says Uganda does not have a doula training facility but one can get the training online from institutes such as DTI (Doula Trainings International) Dona International, ICEA(International Childbirth Education Association), among others. The duration of the course depends on the institution. The courses provided include research on the benefits of doulas and the needs of labouring mothers. Framework to help you assess the needs of a labouring woman and how to provide supportive care for those needs. This includes an in-depth look at pain and anxiety, modes of care and prenatal health.  Namanda says unlike before, today when you google you get to find the different doulas in Uganda and what they can offer. Asked how easy it is to trust a doulas in the labour ward, Bagyenzi says, “By the time someone lets you into the labour ward they already trust you and the two of you have built a relationship. This doula needs to meet with your doctor during the last visits to the hospital. A mother can decide to have both a relative and a doula by her side,” Namanda explains.  Why pay for a doula?  A doula’s supports a pregnant woman with information and practical and emotional care during pregnancy and birth. Doulas often continue caring for new parents and their babies in the first few weeks after birth.  It is important to note that doulas are not trained in clinical care. This means they do not order or interpret medical tests or scans, diagnose medical conditions or give medical advice. Doulas work alongside your midwife and doctor.  Bagyenyi says it is a good idea to let your midwife know that a doula is part of your pregnancy care team. Your doula helps ease pain during labour and helps you relax, massage you , aromatherapy and other things to comfort a mother. Create the birthing environment you want, help remove distractions. Reassures and encourages you, and talks a mother through emotions during labour.  Testimonies  “Initially I had an idea of birth doulas and the services offered. So when I was eight months pregnant, I went to Google and searched for doulas in Uganda. I chanced upon two different organisations offering doula services.  That is when I reached out to Birth with Love. Being a first-time mother and the negative stories around childbirth, I needed someone who would understand me and support me. Before hiring the doula, I found out whether they were registered, I went on to ask for contacts of mothers she had worked with before and if I could meet and interact with them.  She monitored me all the time. She would call to find out how I was doing, or sometimes send encouraging messages, and offer spiritual, emotional and physical support. She came for exercises and attended hospital visits with me.  After birth she was home with me for three days, taking take care of the baby.” (*Jane Mukisa)  Since it was my first child, I was scared of how it was going to be. I heard a number of stories about birth. I needed someone away from my family that would positively comfort me.  That is why I hired the services of a doula. A got my doula at 32 weeks, I went with her for the different hospital visits and my doctors got to know.  My doula guided me on what to eat and what not to eat, she supervised my shopping, not just because something looks good. She was by my labour bed and when I thought I could no longer bear the pain, and the doctors were now opting for a caesarean, she managed to talk to them and asked for more time till I was able to deliver normally.” (Betty Babirye)  Why you need a doula  What problem does a doula solve? If I am an expectant mother, why should I pay for the services of a doula?  A doula’s role is to help pregnant women feel confident about giving birth. She supports a pregnant woman with information and practical and emotional care during pregnancy and birth.  Doulas often continue caring for new parents and their babies in the first few weeks after birth. Doulas aren’t trained in clinical care. This means they don’t order or interpret medical tests or scans, diagnose medical conditions or give medical advice. Doulas work alongside your midwife and doctor.  Mariam Bagyenyi says it is a good idea to let your midwife know that a doula is part of your pregnancy care team. Your doula suggests positions, movements and changes that help ease pain during labour, guide your breathing and help you relax. Offer you massage, hot packs, aromatherapy and other things to comfort you.  Doulas create a condusive birthing environment and helps remove distractions. Reassures and encourages and talks a mother through emotions during labour. Helps you communicate your birth plan to the midwives and doctors caring for you.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbml0b3IuY28udWcvdWdhbmRhL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9mdWxsLXdvbWFuL2RvdWxhcy1zdXBwb3J0aW5nLWV4cGVjdGFudC1tb3RoZXJzLWdpdmUtYmlydGgtd2l0aC1sb3ZlLTQyNDExMTDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The study of period costumes and their underpinnings help create authentic costumes for the stage. As senior cutter, she made patterns from the show designer’s drawings. She took measurements of the actors and then created a pattern to their form.  Brown said it was important to the overall look on stage for the under structure to be right, especially in period dress.  “And then of course the shape of dress that goes over it fits beautifully and shows what is meant to show and hides what it is meant to hide,"" she explained.  Different periods emphasized different areas; sometimes it was the front, sometimes the rear.  Her presentation began with the fashion of the ancient worlds of Crete, Egypt, Greece and Rome.  “Each dealt with breasts in their own way, either making them more prominent and exposing them, or trying to deny them,"" Brown explained.  She took the audience members through the ages, mainly focusing on European fashion and that influenced by the royal courts, showing slides to provide examples.  She explained how those of high status wore undergarments that were not worn by the masses. She talked about busks, stays, corsets, paniers, crinolines, and the more comparatively modern girdles, underpants and bras.  Underwear are the “intimate, mysterious pieces of clothing that have always been part of the feminine allure,"" she explained.  “The birth of modesty no doubt contributed to the invention of underclothing, as did the love of seduction; both hiding and revealing what one wanted to show. It is our second skin and plays a secret role in our lives, but also a very public one,"" Brown described.  Brown showed busks used in the 18th century that were inserted down the front of a dress from the chest to about the belly button. This was meant to keep the body straight, and certainly would have prevented bending at the waist.  She also talked of corsets that bound the upper body so tightly that it could break ribs and deform the back.  “Women's breasts have lived through many incarnations; compressed, uplifted, or left au naturel,"" she explained. ""After centuries of corsets that sheaved our bodies in armour, all to make them more desirable, women finally jettisoned this instrument of torture at the beginning of the 20th century and replaced it with something that was just as complicated but much less restricted, the brassiere.”  Brown has written a book about female riding wear, that will be published soon. She has specialized in the restoration of 18th-, 19th- and 20th-century dresses and textiles for dress historian and private collector, Martin Kamer.  She collaborated with Belgian artist Isabelle de Borchgrave on an exhibit called “Papier a la Mode” which was a collection of full-scale period dresses, from the 16th to the 20th centuries, based on private and museum collections, constructed entirely of paper. Over the period 1996 to 2008, “Papier a la Mode” was exhibited in Brussels, Istanbul, London, New York, Paris, Sao Paulo, Tokyo, Toronto, and Venice.  The WI and the Tecumseth and West Gwillimbury Historical Society co-hosted the informative evening.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9yaWxsaWFtYXR0ZXJzLmNvbS9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL2JpcnRoLW9mLW1vZGVzdHktZW5tZXNoZWQtaW4tdGhlLWhpc3Rvcnktb2Ytd29tZW5zLXVuZGVyd2Vhci03MDEzMDg40gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Experts, critics and fans are asking why the Duke and Duchess of Sussex used taxi to reach the destination after attending the award ceremony.    Meghan and Harry reportedly left the 2023 Women of Vision Awards with Doria Ragland, when the trio was swarmed by the paparazzi when driving away in their SUV with their security detail.    After two hours of circling about the venue where the awards ceremony had taken place, the couple’s driver took the couple of Sussex to New York’s police department’s 19th precinct police station, where they switched vehicles in an attempt to make a stealth getaway.    It seems as Meghan and Harry were trying to thwart the relentless efforts of the paparazzi by leaving the police station in the most assuming way possible.  The California-based couple's security guard flagged down a cab, driven by Sukhcharn ‘Sonny’ Singh.  Sonny reportedly drove them a block away, before his taxi was blocked by a garbage truck. The paparazzi then swarmed the vehicle, taking more pictures of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.  Sonny told media outlets that the couple “looked nervous,” but were not being as aggressive as the couple’s spokesperson suggested.  However, Meghan, Harry and Doria have not yet publicly commented on the incident.  Meghan and Harry were in a taxi (and not their SUV) when the incident occurred was to throw off photographers and make a safe return home to the residence where they were staying.

Matthew Sunday, the Director of Vital Registration Department, National Population Commission (NPC), said on Friday that with the digitisation, the commission plans to register 8.08 million children in 22 priority states and 4.6 million in other states.  Mr Sunday spoke in Lagos during the opening of a two-day workshop on the operational plans for digital birth registration in the state organised by NPC Lagos office in collaboration with United Nation Children’s Fund (UNICEF).  He said the digitisation would increase the percentage of children with birth certificates which is currently 33% – 63% in urban areas and 32% in rural areas.  “For us to have a complete registration of children, there must be certification and until one is issued a certificate, that is when we can say one has been registered,” he said.  Last week, the NPC and UNICEF announced the roll out of the digitisation process in Kano, targeting the birth registration of one million children in Kano.  Rahama Farah, UNICEF’s Kano Chief of Field Office, said the registration helps to protect children and their rights from birth.  “Most societies first acknowledge a child’s existence and identity through birth registration,” he said.  The FG’s birth registration efforts are now showing progress, with 57% of children under age five registered (about 19.6 million children), compared with only 47 per cent in 2016/17, according to UNICEF. Although national data reveal no gender disparity in these numbers, children are less likely to be registered if they live in rural areas or poor households.  At Friday’s workshop, Mr Sunday said only 33% of children in Nigeria actually have birth certificates, adding that birth registration data is critical to planning by any government.  “We will go on an aggressive social mobilisation in collaboration with stakeholders, especially the National Orientation Agency (NOA). A greater percentage of our population don’t know there is what we call birth registration,” he said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoYW5uZWxzdHYuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMjAvZmVkZXJhbC1nb3Z0LXRvLWRpZ2l0aXNlLWJpcnRoLXJlZ2lzdHJhdGlvbi1vZi0xMi1taWxsaW9uLWNoaWxkcmVuL9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoYW5uZWxzdHYuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMjAvZmVkZXJhbC1nb3Z0LXRvLWRpZ2l0aXNlLWJpcnRoLXJlZ2lzdHJhdGlvbi1vZi0xMi1taWxsaW9uLWNoaWxkcmVuL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Alexee Trevizo, 19, is charged with murder after she gave birth in a hospital bathroom then placed the baby in a trash bag, where it was tragically found dead.  Her attorney, Gary C Mitchell, told DailyMail.com the teenager wasn't aware of the pregnancy when she attended the Artesia General Hospital on January 27 with back pain.  Tests revealed she was pregnant and in labor. She then locked herself in a hospital bathroom for an extended period of time. After she returned, a cleaner found the bathroom covered in blood and then called nurses after lifting the heavy trash bag.  She was charged on May 10 with first-degree murder, 'or alternatively' intentional abuse of a child resulting in death, plus a count for tampering with evidence.  Alexee Trevizo, 19, was not aware that she was pregnant before giving birth to her son  The harrowing moment police confronted Trevizo in the hospital was captured in body camera footage that showed her tell officers: 'It came out of me, I put it in the bag. In the trash bag. I'm sorry mom.'  Mitchell said that the child was found to have died of asphyxia.  He claims Trevizo had gone into the hospital bathroom alone while still unaware that she was pregnant.  She remained there unattended for 18 minutes, giving birth and then placing the baby in the trash can.  Artesia General Hospital declined to comment citing the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, a federal law that protects sensitive patient health information from being disclosed without the patient's consent or knowledge.  Police body camera footage shows Trevizo admitting to placing the baby in the bag.  'It came out of me, I put it in the bag. In the trash bag. I'm sorry mom' the teenager told her mother.  Mitchell continued: 'This child did not cause the death of this baby. She did not know that she was pregnant.'  'It came out of me, I put it in the bag. In the trash bag. I'm sorry mom' the traumatized teen whispers  Trevizo's mother appears not to have known her daughter was nine months pregnant  Newly released bodycam footage shows the heartbreaking admission  'This was a very traumatic experience,' the lawyer said.  Mitchell also revealed that the baby's father has been 'very supportive' of Trevizo, and was also unaware of the pregnancy, which he says is not unusual.  In the bodycam footage, a doctor wearing a white lab coat explains to Trevizo and her mother: 'We discovered a dead baby in the bathroom.'  Trevizo tells the doctor: 'I'm sorry, it came out of me and I didn't know what to do ... I was just scared, it was not crying or nothing.'  Her distraught mother holds her head in her hands as she pleads with her daughter, saying: 'What did you do?'  'What did you do to it' the mother demands and holds her head in her hands in desperation, before the doctor tells her to 'stop right there'.  'The number one priority guys' the doctor goes on 'is she just had a baby, I don't know whether she has delivered the placenta. She's bleeding significantly' she says, before explaining that the teenager must be moved to the obstetrician.  'I'm sorry about this, but in terms of delivering a baby and it looked like you tried to hide it, we do have to have the police involved.  'The baby is going to have to be taken for autopsy and there will be an investigator and everything' the doctor continues in a calm voice.  Artesia General Hospital  Gary C Mitchell told DailyMail.com that Trevizo was not responsible for her baby's death  'I'm so sorry, but we need to do this correctly and I want to be transparent with you about what our steps are going to be.'  'Nothing was crying, it came out with nothing' Trevizo repeats.  A male medic in the room then asks the mother and daughter if they have any questions, to which Trevizo's mother asks how big the baby is.  'It's full term' the masked medic responds.  'What!' she exclaims, suggesting she did not know that her daughter was nine months pregnant prior to the birth.  'Lexi, have you watched the news, about what the girls do to their babies and they go to jail' the mother asks in frustration.  A traumatized Trevizo bursts into tears and is then told that there are detectives on the way to talk to her and that she is now detained in the hospital under police custody.  In a statement shared with DailyMail.com Artesia Police Department said: 'Our officers and crime scene processor, along with the hospital staff, experienced a heartbreaking situation on that January morning and have been coping with what they encountered.  'One of the worst calls any first responder or public service person has to respond to, is the severe injury or death of a child.  'We are expected to be 'tough' in those types of incidents because of our job titles, but in all actuality, we are quite the opposite.  'Our routine calls of service or emergency responses are usually carried out easily with commitment and dedication for our city, but a call like this can be a breaking point for some or all of those involved.  'It's important that we provide the very best resources, counseling, and stress management tools to help our staff cope with this traumatic event, so that they may continue their dedicated service.  Adding: 'As far as Trevizo is concerned, she refused to speak to our investigators on the incident.'  At the beginning of the released body cam footage, a nurse told responding officers that Trevizo had a positive pregnancy test but denied having sex.  Trevizo locked herself in the hospital bathroom on January 27 gave birth to the baby boy before placing him in the trash can, investigators said.  By the time the baby was found, he had died, investigators said.  An autopsy listed the cause of death as a homicide in March.  On May 10, Trevizo was charged with first-degree murder, 'or alternatively' intentional abuse of a child resulting in death, plus a count for tampering with evidence.  Trevizo has since been released from jail and will be able to finish the school year without an ankle monitor or house arrest, while she waits to stand trial.  This is the second high-profile case of a mother and newborn baby in New Mexico in recent years.  Jurors convicted Alexis Avila, 19, of throwing her newborn into an outdoor trash receptacle in January 2020 in Hobbs, New Mexico.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUtMTIxMDQxODkvVGVlbi1kdW1wZWQtbmV3Ym9ybi1ob3NwaXRhbC10cmFzaC1iYWctZGlkLU5PVC1rbm93LXByZWduYW50Lmh0bWzSAXdodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlLTEyMTA0MTg5L2FtcC9UZWVuLWR1bXBlZC1uZXdib3JuLWhvc3BpdGFsLXRyYXNoLWJhZy1kaWQtTk9ULWtub3ctcHJlZ25hbnQuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"birth","1922-10-02","Not Discerned","{""Tulsa"", ""Oklahoma"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T20:29:00","Martin Scorsese’s western true-crime thriller is about the US’s Osage murders of the early 1920s, based on the nonfiction bestseller by David Grann. With co-writer Eric Roth, Scorsese crafts an epic of creeping, existential horror about the birth of the American century, a macabre tale of quasi-genocidal serial killings which mimic the larger erasure of Native Americans from the US. It places in the drama’s foreground a gaslit marriage of lies and poisoned love. It echoes Scorsese’s earlier work about mob violence, mob loyalty and the final, inevitable sellout to the federal authorities, whose own bad faith gradually emerges. But in the end, this film is about what all westerns are about, and perhaps all history: the brutal grab for land, resources and power.  Lily Gladstone gives a performance of tragic force as Mollie Burkhart, a Native American woman from the Osage tribe who, like all her people, has become unexpectedly wealthy because the apparently stony and unpromising land in Oklahoma on which the authorities allowed the Osage to settle turned out to have huge reserves of oil. But they are still subject to a racist and infantilising condition of “guardianship”: to claim the income and spend it, Osage individuals need a white co-signatory. And there is something else: Mollie and her family are deeply disturbed by mysterious illnesses which have been killing off Osage people, one by one. Later the bodies of Osage murder-victims are found, including Mollie’s wayward sister Anna (Cara Jade Myers), whose autopsy is bizarrely carried out in the open air, at the crime scene itself.  Into this situation arrives a slippery, venal individual called Ernest, played by Leonardo DiCaprio; an ambitious but also submissive and fundamentally inadequate man: greedy, stupid and biddable. He has returned to the US after service in the first world war, and comes to the vast estate of his wealthy uncle, who has offered him a job working alongside his hardfaced brother Bryan (pronounced “By-ran”), played by Scott Shepherd, who has clearly been extensively normalised in the violence and corruption over which the uncle presides.  Spiritual nausea … Lily Gladstone and Leonardo DiCaprio in Killers of the Flower Moon. Photograph: AP  This cattleman-plutocrat is William Hale, played by Robert De Niro, a man of calcified resentment and self-importance who preens himself on his good relations with the Osage people. Hale hires Ernest for a position as his vague underling, courtier and dirty-work factotum, and encourages him to date and also marry Mollie, whom Ernest has already met, which would give him (and therefore Hale) a legal claim on Mollie’s “headrights”, as her oil entitlements are known. And so Ernest and Mollie’s doomed marriage commences, complicated by the terrible fears of Mollie’s ailing mother, Lizzie Q (Tantoo Cardinal), who has a quietly beautiful death scene. Mollie’s diabetes is also a factor; it is made strangely worse by the medicine Hale has procured for her, and which Ernest administers while always simpering and blubbing his concern for her declining health.  When the situation becomes too bad for the federal authorities to ignore, Washington DC sends an officer of its fledgling Bureau of Investigations (later to be the FBI). This is Tom White, played by Jesse Plemons. But Scorsese shows us the politics: the bureau’s belated appearance appears to be, at least partly, a matter of containing the difficult situation involving the white people and the inescapably wealthy Osage peoples, and reinforcing federal control over the new state of Oklahoma.  As performed by Gladstone and DiCaprio, the relationship between Mollie and Ernest has a kind of spiritual nausea; Ernest is sincere about his feelings for his wife, in his way, but they are part of a context of bad faith and violence. His real relationship is of course with his uncle, he is the beta to the older man’s alpha. Weirdly, DiCaprio starts to look like DeNiro, like a dog resembling its master: a younger, victim-villain version with the same gimlet-eyed fear and hostility and the same rat-trap mouth with the corners turned down. His uncle has inducted him into the Masons, and it is into the local masonic hall, with all its regalia, that Hale leads the wretched Ernest for a corporal punishment scene when the young man lets him down – the most extraordinary corporal punishment I have seen since Lindsay Anderson’s If….  Hale’s rule, so avowedly caring and sensitive to the Osage, is in fact creating a vast dysfunction of depression, alcoholism, lawlessness, fatal illness and murder. Gladstone creates a persona for Mollie that is flawed and self-reproachful, with some shame at having collaborated with her persecutor. She has dignity and calm and rises above the squalor all around her, but that calm is also the stricken immobility of illness. And she knows that Ernest was never any good but she was charmed and seduced by him all the same.  Scorsese presents a remarkable story, with an audacious framing device of a briskly insensitive “true crime” radio show featuring Osage characters crassly played by white actors. This is an utterly absorbing film, a story that Scorsese sees as a secret history of American power, a hidden violence epidemic polluting the water table of humanity.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9maWxtLzIwMjMvbWF5LzIwL2tpbGxlcnMtb2YtdGhlLWZsb3dlci1tb29uLXJldmlldy1tYXJ0aW4tc2NvcnNlc2UtbGVvbmFyZG8tZGljYXByaW_SAXBodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vZmlsbS8yMDIzL21heS8yMC9raWxsZXJzLW9mLXRoZS1mbG93ZXItbW9vbi1yZXZpZXctbWFydGluLXNjb3JzZXNlLWxlb25hcmRvLWRpY2Fwcmlv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Bill films diary cams on the show so you'll get to see it all on Twin Life.'  MailOnline has contacted Amy's representative for comment.  Sharing an Instagram update ahead of The Twin Life, she said: 'I am very excited to bring viewers in on this crazy journey with twins, as I become a mum to four under five!  'Bill and I eagerly anticipate sharing every moment, from the bustling nesting phase, birth via emergency c-section, to the raw reality of the days following the twins' arrival, and finally a very exciting proposal!  'We are thrilled to have the cameras come along for the ride capturing all those special moments.'  Amy welcomed her twins via cesarean section earlier this month, but friends later admitted she was left shattered by the procedure.  A source told The Sun: 'Amy's welcomed boy and girl twin babies. She's overjoyed, but exhausted after a long labour.  'Amy and Billy are over the moon by their new arrivals.'  Birth the birth, Amy spoke openly about how doctors were monitoring her closely with weekly check-ups after her waters broke early during her past pregnancies with daughter Polly and also son Ritchie.  Writing for her OK! magazine column, the star explained the birth could be natural or caesarean, despite the latter being booked.  Newborn: According to The Sun baby Billy was hospitalised with fluid on his lungs, with the traumatic events set to be shown in the series  Describing her plan as 'open', Amy shared: 'Like I've said from day one – if I can go natural then I will. My phrase of the year is 'anything can happen'.'  'While the twins aren't coming imminently, doctors are concerned because my waters went with my previous pregnancies so it could happen at any time,' she continued.  Caesarean section is the surgical procedure by which the babies will be delivered through an incision in Amy's abdomen, rather than a vaginal delivery. The procedure is often performed if a natural birth would put the mother at risk.  Adding that things are looking good from previous scans, Amy shared that she can be left up to 38 weeks in the term before giving birth, as the twins are not identical.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvdHZzaG93Yml6L2FydGljbGUtMTIxMDU0MDEvQW15LUNoaWxkcy1yZXZlYWxzLW5ld2Jvcm4tc29uLWhvc3BpdGFsaXNlZC1zaG9ydGx5LWJpcnRoLW5ldy1UVi1zaG93Lmh0bWzSAYUBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHltYWlsLmNvLnVrL3R2c2hvd2Jpei9hcnRpY2xlLTEyMTA1NDAxL2FtcC9BbXktQ2hpbGRzLXJldmVhbHMtbmV3Ym9ybi1zb24taG9zcGl0YWxpc2VkLXNob3J0bHktYmlydGgtbmV3LVRWLXNob3cuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Three games that would tell one story and that you could carry one hero all the way through - that's not just bold, that's borderline outrageous, especially when you consider all the choices and consequences typically in one of the studio's games. And it's only now, really, when I see no one else attempting to do the same thing - not to that degree, anyway - I realise how special it was.  Perhaps it was so hard to do, BioWare never wanted to do it again. It's a thought that leads me down a rabbit hole and to someone I've dubbed Mr Mass Effect: Mac Walters, the writer who spent 19 years at BioWare, and most of it writing and making Mass Effect. He was senior writer on ME1, lead writer on ME2 and ME3, creative director (eventually) on Andromeda, and then project director on the Legendary Edition remaster. He wrote Mass Effect books and graphic novels, and, it turns out, he was there at the very beginning, when a core group of people - project leader Casey Hudson, systems designer Preston Watamaniuk, and writer Drew Karpyshyn - dreamt Mass Effect up.  And the trilogy idea was already there then, he says. ""It was definitely Casey [Hudson's] idea,"" Walters tells me, in a larger podcast interview you'll see embedded in this piece, and is available wherever you listen to podcasts.  ""I would often sit in their office and we would [talk about], 'What is the game going to be?' But from the level of 'it was Jack Bauer in space' - that was an early thing that we talked about, and the idea of it being a trilogy of games. That was something that Casey had put a stamp on very early, even before, when I was still finishing off Jade Empire.""  And the reasoning behind it being a trilogy was two-fold: one, to make it feel cinematic, in the way that the three-arc Star Wars story was. Hudson was apparently greatly inspired by Star Wars. ""We often talked about Mass Effect 2 being the darker middle act, much like Empire [Strikes Back] - there was a lot of influence coming from that from day one.""  Here's my full chat with Mac Walters. Guess who his favourite Mass Effect character is? (They don't have a moustache like mine though do they?)  Two: BioWare needed an exciting innovation to sell the series with. This was a new IP, remember - the studio had left Star Wars behind with Knights of the Old Republic, and was now striking out into space on its own. And a trilogy was exactly the kind of idea that would make people take notice of it. ""Saying we're going to do three games in a franchise: okay that's challenging,"" says Walters. ""But [saying] we're going to do three games where the choice and consequences actually carry over for you: that was the big bold innovation that we tackled.""  On the very first design document, then, were sections for Mass Effect 2 and 3. Small sections, mind you. ""At that time, we had maybe a generous paragraph of what we thought Mass Effect 2 might be,"" he says, ""and literally a line on what Mass Effect 3 would be. And it would be very aspirational, like, 'Let's wrap this whole thing up!'""  The intention was to seed ideas that would grow through the series, but exactly where they'd end up or how they'd be resolved, they didn't know. The pervading feeling was, ""We're not going to answer this now, and we don't know how or where or when we'll answer it, but we want to put the mystery in there and then pay it off some day going forward.""  Walters remembers talking about the romance arcs a lot back then, and already there were ideas for Ashley and Kaidan to be potential romances that would stretch through the trilogy. ""I remember even talking, early days, about having Ash and Kaidan - or whoever survives of course - fall away from you in the second game only to return in the third game, and this idea that if you stayed true to them there might be something different than if you didn't."" And, of course, that idea made it into the final game.  But a lot of things were left open-ended simply because ""we weren't sure where we wanted to take things"". For instance, you've probably read about the different ideas BioWare originally had for the Reapers and what was going on there, and how it would all be wrapped up. The original lead writer, Drew Karpyshyn, had this whole Dark Energy idea that wasn't used. But he wasn't upset about that when I spoke him about it, in the wake of Mass Effect 3 being released. As he told me, ""projects evolve, and you rarely end up in the place you expected when you first started"".  Walters adds: ""There's so much of the way that we handle story and world building in these IPs that's very organic. There's obviously things that you hash out before anyone starts really doing work to build the game, but then the actual building of the game is where I would say a majority of that world-building happens."" Plus, ""you don't know how the fans are going to respond"". What if fans hate an idea you've really gone in on, or what if their tastes change? BioWare wasn't just committing to one game, after all, but three, stretched over a decade of development. It had to try and remain flexible.  To see this content please enable targeting cookies. Manage cookie settings  The other benefit of putting off the worrying was it freed the team up creatively. ""The fact that we created a suicide mission in Mass Effect 2, where any or all or none of the characters could survive, tells you that we weren't too daunted after [Mass Effect] One on complexity, because there couldn't be anything you could do that's more complex than that and then have to follow it up. So by the time we landed on that concept for the suicide squad,"" he says, ""we often joked in the early days, 'Well I guess our future selves won't be too happy with this but it's a great idea so let's go ahead with it!'""  In other words, ""we didn't let it hold us back"", and it's an attitude Walters really loved seeing on the team. ""Every once in a while we'd be like, 'Okay this is going to be challenging,' but we had that sort of 'we'll figure it out' mentality 'when the time is right'. And I'm so thankful for that, because if you think of all the things that people tend to talk about when they're referring to Mass Effect 2 [...] the suicide squad, the conflicts that you can have with your characters. All of that is, like you said, it's a spaghetti of conditionals and things like that in the background, that if we had taken too much time and said, 'Oh this is going to be hard, let's not do it,' well, Mass Effect 2 wouldn't have been what Mass Effect 2 was.""  While Mass Effect 1 was in development, the team was preoccupied solely with getting Mass Effect 1 done. When Mass Effect 2 was developed and the team pulled in the conditionals from ME1, yes it was bigger than people expected, but confidence was still high, as represented by the complex suicide mission. But when work began on Mass Effect 3, it couldn't be put off any longer - team knew what it needed to do now would be tricky. ""We also realised that it was going to be not just tricky but also probably more expensive,"" Walters says, in terms of the extra work the team would need to do.  ""I think Mass Effect 3 is on par with being bigger than Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 1 combined""  ""A lot of folk don't realise how much content is actually in Mass Effect 3 as opposed to the other games,"" he says, ""simply because of all of those conditions. On a single playthrough, you're only going to see a fraction of what we actually created for Mass Effect 3 because all these other conditions can come into play - different people can be dead, different people can be alive, different people can like you or not like you.""  In fact, he adds: ""I think Mass Effect 3 is on par with being bigger than Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 1 combined."" He saw this again recently while making the Legendary Edition of the game.  But an important detail to remember is that by that point, the team had made two Mass Effect games and were really familiar with the technology, had a template to build on, and intimately knew the characters and where their storylines were heading. BioWare could handle it because of the groundwork it laid making ME1 and ME2.  ""In Mass Effect 1,"" Walters says, ""we shipped so much content that you probably didn't see because it was meant to come out of the game. But it was actually still left in, hooked up, because we were still figuring out Unreal, we were figuring out the tools, we were figuring all that stuff. So if you actually cleaned it up and got more efficient with it, that's where we were at with ME3, and yet it was still so huge - just a massive amount of work.  ""If you took Mass Effect 3,"" he adds, ""content-wise, and said, 'Now build that but back when you're figuring everything out in Mass Effect 1,' it would have taken us ten years probably to do that, to figure it all out!""  So although resolving a trilogy with threads branching out ""almost to infinity"" was a daunting task, the team apparently managed it without many problems, according to Walters. ""It is a feat that, because we were in it, we didn't realise how special it was,"" he says. ""But if you just look at [it as] a work of interactive fiction across those three titles, and the fact that it holds up as a story, just that in and of itself is actually incredible.  ""But the amount of work that we've done there to really let the players feel like they have autonomy, like 'it's my Shepard and it's my story', and there are so many of those versions of that story out there: even I don't have a full understanding of how crazy and complex and ultimately impressive it was that we were able to pull that off over the course of three games.""  Guess who created Garrus? That's right: Mac Walters.  It begs the question, to come back to where I began, of why BioWare hasn't done something like the trilogy again. It certainly drew attention to the series, and I'm convinced it would do the same for any new game BioWare made now. But no, apparently it never came up. ""I don't think we've ever talked about that again,"" Walters says. And the 'Why?' of it seems to be simply because, ""We've done that - what else can we do?""  That doesn't mean all of the trilogy-linked ideas were dropped, though. The Dragon Age series has let you pull in saved-game data for a while, and although you can't play as the same character in all three existing games, you can import saved world states, and even go as far as to talk to your Hawke from DA2, in Dragon Age Inquisition, which is neat.  There's more trilogy thinking in Mass Effect Andromeda than I'd realised, too, because even though it wasn't envisaged as a new Mass Effect trilogy - and the tempatation must have been there - it was conceived from the very beginning as a linked series of games, which your choices and consequences could ripple through. ""We knew that we wanted it to be a series, for sure,"" Walters says, ""but not a trilogy per se. I think the idea of carrying plots and story and characters through the series, and choice and consequence, was actually part of it on Andromeda, but early days Andromeda, and I wasn't on the project then."" (I'll come back to that last point.)  Instead, the big innovation with Andromeda was going to be a procedurally generated universe inspired by No Man's Sky - ""something where you could really feel like you're actually exploring a universe"", Walters says. But sadly it was one of the ideas the team could never quite make work. ""Ultimately, that was too much at odds with a lot of the way that we tell stories, and the way that we create our content, which tends to be very bespoke - a lot of big set-pieces and things like that. It's hard to translate into a procedural world. But that was, at the start at least, that innovation that we were looking at, or what the teams were looking at.""  ""We were also in a weird phase in the industry where a lot of people were saying quantity was quality""  To come back to the 'Walters not being on the Andromeda team at the beginning point': Walters, like many others in the original Mass Effect team, had gone to work on Anthem. Andromeda, remember, was primarily a BioWare Montreal game, not an Edmonton one. Walters, then, was narrative designer of Anthem, but he was pulled over to Andromeda when Mass Effect overlord Casey Hudson left BioWare in 2014, followed by Andromeda game director Gérard Lehiany shortly after. The project needed some core leadership and Walters was it.  Much has been made of Andromeda's difficult development and how ideas like the No Man's Sky procedurally generated universe, and the new Frostbite engine - and it being made by a much newer BioWare team - held things up. So when Walters eventually took over the reins, there was a lot of work still to do.  ""It wasn't so much that it was in disarray or anything like that,"" he says, ""but it was in that pivot point, in that sort of inflection of, 'Oh we can't do both procedural - all of this stuff - and fulfil all the wishes and hopes of our fanbase who really want to see a lot of this bespoke narrative written in a certain way.'  ""It wasn't just making another Mass Effect game, which the team was well on their way to doing, it was how do we do it and also innovate in more of an open-world space?""  Mass Effect Andromeda would eventually come out in 2017, but all the difficulties with development had prevented it from reaching the heights of the previous Mass Effect games. Reviews were lukewarm to disappointed, sales were weaker than before, and in response to it, the entire Mass Effect series was put ""on ice"". To some degree, Walters can accept that. ""I don't know if people were too harsh,"" he says, ""we had set a very high bar with Mass Effect 3, and certainly in some key areas, we didn't live up to that.""  But what still bugs him about the reception is that Mass Effect 3 was a misleading yardstick to use as a comparison. As Walters mentioned earlier: by the time BioWare made ME3, the team had incrementally honed all areas of development from making Mass Effect 1 and 2. Andromeda, by comparison, was being made by a new team and on a new engine, and it had a whole roster of new characters and a new story. And okay there were some Mass Effect veterans on the team but in reality, the whole project was closer to Mass Effect 1 than Mass Effect 3.  ""So you go back to what I was saying before, when I said if you tried to put all the content of Mass Effect 3 on the Mass Effect 1 team, it would have taken us ten years,"" Walters says. ""Similarly, there were just a lot of things that we had to relearn, re-figure out, and ultimately when you do that, it's very, very challenging to come out and be as polished as your third iteration was, and we didn't hit that. And we probably should have - in hindsight - just reduced scope more and executed on what we could to [ensure] quality.  ""But,"" he adds, ""we were also in a weird phase in the industry where a lot of people were saying quantity was quality, so we were deluding ourselves internally a little bit that if it's maybe not as polished as [Mass Effect 3], it's fine - it's bigger and there's more here, and there's more to do. And we hit a point where people were like, 'No, that isn't okay.' Or, at least, 'It isn't okay for your franchise'. And that's fine, that's a lesson learned.  ""I only wish we had been able to then do a second one, because then you would have really seen that polish just like we did from [ME1] to [ME2] on the original [trilogy].""  Watch on YouTube How do you feel about Andromeda now - fan or foe?  Andromeda was a low-point for BioWare at the time and a perceived step down in terms of quality. But the company's standing would fall further when Anthem launched two years later - a game that was always an odd prospect for a renowned single-player RPG studio. And sadly the final product did nothing to change people's minds. Anthem was a game that struggled to find an identity of its own, and an audience, and so, two years later, EA and BioWare effectively gave up on it.  For fans of BioWare, this meant two high profile disappointments in a row - three, sort of, if you count the backlash to the original ending of Mass Effect 3. It's not a nice position to be in, and Walters was in the middle of all of it. ""Oh no we definitely felt it,"" he says of the negative feedback the studio received.  The studio's shortfall,as he sees it, had been in not marrying the innovation it likes to bring with ""the expected BioWare experience"". ""And in Anthem it was even more of a dichotomy,"" he adds, ""it almost felt like two games in one, and neither really fully fleshed out, unfortunately.""  But that's what innovation sometimes costs, he says, and it's what he'd try to remind newer people at the studio of. ""When I joined BioWare, we were innovative,"" he says. ""We were always trying to push. And innovation sometimes means you don't get it right, unfortunately, and what you really hope for is that opportunity to improve upon it.  ""When I joined BioWare, we were innovative. We were always trying to push""  ""With Mass Effect, arguably there's lots of things that we didn't do right, but then we got to hone it and improve it on Two, and then perfect it on Three. With more time, Anthem was already trending to something that was actually pretty unique and interesting and had a really legitimate argument to be in the game space, but it just needed time to get there. And certainly had we shipped an Andromeda 2, I am a hundred percent certain we would have improved on all the things that people called out and then also been about to lean into the innovative things that we were trying to do as well.""  Maybe BioWare will still get that opportunity to iterate on Andromeda with Mass Effect 5. The signs are promising: development has been moved back to BioWare HQ in Edmonton (partly because BioWare Montreal is no more - it's EA Motive) and it seems as though the problematic Frostbite engine has been ditched for Unreal Engine 5, though this hasn't been confirmed. There's even a suggestion Mass Effect 5 will pull on story threads from Andromeda, meaning those original ideas of Andromeda beginning a linked series may still be there.  Walters was involved in the vision for the Mass Effect, too. ""Yeah,"" he says. ""Again, it was more of a consulting thing. As - obviously as you said - the Mass Effect guy, I was in there with Casey [Hudson] and we were talking about where that would go, along with Mike [Gamble]. And then once Legendary [Edition] kicked off and we got that green-lit [...] it was like, 'All right, everyone, I'm going to go do this - good luck. I'm here if you need me but I'm going to focus on this.'""  But BioWare today is different to the BioWare that originated Mass Effect - even the BioWare that made Andromeda. Walters, like Casey Hudson, is no longer there, and nor are a significant number of the people who shaped the company once upon a time. Walters himself left at the end of 2022 after spending a brief period on the Dragon Age team, on the new game Dreadwolf, albeit in a production management capacity rather than creative.  ""I did a lot of soul-searching at various points,"" he says of his decision to leave, ""and usually when a game ships is a time to do that. And when I shipped Mass Effect Legendary Edition [...] I knew at the end of that that I was done, at least for the short-term, of doing anything Mass Effect. I had done a lot of Mass Effect. And I love the series but I also wanted to do something new.""  Watch on YouTube The question now, I suppose, is how much of what Mac Walters envisaged will carry on into Mass Effect 5? There's been a significant break between games now. Will the storylines connect? Will it be able to improve on Andromeda in the way ME2 did on ME1? So many questions!  Launching new IPs, or new worlds, is something that's in his blood, he says. He's one of the few people at BioWare who was there to witness the launch of three new IPs: Jade Empire (I wish they'd bring that back), Mass Effect and Anthem. ""And I'm a person who is always dreaming up new worlds, so I was like, 'I think it's time to start really considering what is out there beyond Mass Effect and just adding to Mass Effect.'""  It's also time, he believes, to let someone else have a go - to let a new generation of Mass Effect belong to a new generation of developers. ""There are now people who come to BioWare who are fans of the franchise before they started working on it as a developer,"" he says. So another part of his leaving is, ""I don't want to make it sound too altruistic, but making way for the next generation to add their mark to the franchise.  ""And then I was just starting to feel that itch that you feel,"" he says. ""It's nineteen years - nineteen-plus years at BioWare. I've talked to other people who have gone on and done some other things, and it was just that point where i was like, 'If i'm going to really stay engaged in making games, and really stay fulfilled day-to-day, I need a bit more of a seismic shift and not just moving to another project internally.'  ""And I looked at lots of options and other things at Electronic Arts in general that I could do, [or] 'is there something new I could do at BioWare?' But ultimately the decision was I just needed to make a clean break.""  So he did. Walters took some time off to think about what he wanted to do next, and that's where he's at now, thinking about the future of interactive fiction and about where we're headed with technologies like AI, and playing around with possible worlds that might come from it - much like he once did with the Neverwinter Nights toolset, which would ultimately land him a job at BioWare. Where it will all lead him this time, he doesn't know, but if it results in anything like the Mass Effect stories he's helped bring us already, then there are exciting adventures ahead.

In different healthcare systems, outpatient KMC programmes (KMCPs) have been pioneers in the follow-up of these high-risk newborns.  Here, we describe an overview analysis performed in an unprecedented data set comprising Colombian infants and spanning 28 years.  Methods Cohort study of 57 154 infants discharged home in kangaroo position (KP) for follow-up in four KMCPs between 1993 and 2021.  Results At birth and at hospital discharge to a KMCP, median gestational age and weight were 34.5 and 36 weeks, 2000 g and 2200 g, respectively. Chronological age at admission was 8 days. Over time, anthropometric measures at birth and somatic growth during follow-up improved; on the other hand, percentages of mechanical ventilation, intraventricular haemorrhage and need for intensive care decreased as neuropsychomotor, sensory disorders and bronchopulmonary dysplasia incidence at 40 weeks. Risk of cerebral palsy and teenage mothers’ frequency was higher in the poorest population. Early home discharge in KP in less than 72 hours was possible in 19% of the cohort. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we observed a more than twofold increase in exclusive breast feeding at 6 months and a reduction in readmission rates.  Conclusion This study provides a general overview of KMCPs follow-up during the last 28 years within the Colombian healthcare system. These descriptive analyses have allowed us to structure KMC as an evidence-based method. KMCPs allow close monitoring with regular feedback about preterm or LBW infants’ perinatal care, quality of care over time and health status during their first year of life. Monitoring these outcomes is challenging but guarantees access to high-risk infants’ care with equity.

Newborn Travis Rivera burst into this world in the comfort of his own home — on the bathroom floor to be exact — the day after Mother’s Day, weighing in at 8 lbs, 6 oz, and measuring 20 inches. Both mom and baby are doing fine.  Luckily, his parents, mom Jocelyn and her husband, Robert Rivera, are both nurses — he a registered nurses at Maimonides Medical Center and she a Nurse Practitioner at Staten Island Unviersity Hospital — but neither had ever delivered a baby before, let alone their own baby.  “I’m a pediatric Registered Nurse and my wife Jocelyn is a Nurse Practitioner and we were expecting our second [baby], whose due date was Monday, May 15,” said dad Robert, in an exclusive interview with the Advance/SILive.com. “Around 3 a.m. on the 15th, Jocelyn woke me up when her contractions started, so I began to get things ready.  “I went outside to get the car packed with the hospital bags and other essentials that we needed when Jocelyn called me and told me I needed to come inside NOW! Once I returned inside, I heard her yell, ‘I think I feel his head!’”  Shocked is an understatement as Robert ran over and found his wife hunched over their bathroom sink, in active labor.

(Courtesy Robert Rivera)  ‘I GRABBED A BUNCH OF TOWELS AND WENT INTO DELIVERY MODE’  “I saw the top of the baby’s head and I knew birth was imminent,” he said. “The baby was coming there and then, regardless of what we both had planned. I grabbed a bunch of towels and went into delivery mode.”  As Jocelyn called 911, her contractions intensified and her baby’s head fully appeared. The couple felt reassured that the ambulance was on the way. However, they still faced the risky task at hand.  “I was extremely worried the baby wouldn’t pass easily, but Jocelyn gave another push and the baby’s shoulder fired out like a cannon followed by the rest of the baby’s body,” explained Robert. “The baby let out a strong cry and then I cleaned the baby up and wrapped him up to keep him warm.  “I then placed the baby in Jocelyn’s arms while we waited for the ambulance to arrive. With the comfort of her midwife on Facetime video, and ambulance en route, we felt like everything was okay. The most stressful part of the delivery was the thought of him being stuck and not able to deliver naturally. I was worried more about his survival.”  Once the baby’s shoulders passed, the couple was relieved and a lot more comfortable with the situation.

Within a few minutes, the EMTs arrived to their home. They cut the umbilical cord and brought Robert, Jocelyn, and baby Travis to Staten Island University Hospital, where the baby stayed in the neonatal intensive care unit for a 24-hour observation because he was born outside of the hospital. Travis stayed with mom in Jocelyn’s room for another 12 hours.  “The emergency room staff took great care of us,” Robert added. “I just want to thank the EMT professionals, the SIUH staff and everyone who helped us safely welcome our son Travis Rivera to our family.”  Older brother, Robbie, 4, did not have such a dramatic entrance into the world.

(Courtesy Robert Rivera)  “Robbie’s birth, from beginning of labor to birth, was about seven hours, so it was nowhere near as quick,” said Robert, laughing. “Robbie first met baby Travis as his mother was getting out on the stretcher with EMS. He woke up with all the chaos [of the delivery]. He held him for a minute and gave him a kiss.  Today, the family is now settling into their new, expanded family life, with Robbie adjusting well to his big brother role, always asking to hold Travis and offering to help feed him.  “Having my son unexpectedly at home was a life-changing experience,” Jocelyn said. “There is no greater gift than to be able to bring life into this world, and the fact that we were able to safely do it as a family makes it even more precious.”  Robert Rivera and his second son, Travis Rivera, are transported to at Staten Island University Hospital on May 15, 2023, after his wife, Jocelyn Padilla, gave birth to Travis at home.

Known for its breathtaking natural beauty, and tax-friendliness, Cyprus is an excellent option for people looking to reduce their tax liability while living in a high-standard EU jurisdiction.  If you have Cypriot origin, it’d be a no-brainer to pursue the Cyprus CBD route considering all its perks. At Nomad Capitalist, we’ve helped many clients reconnect with their roots and acquire a second passport by descent, and we can help you do the same. Set up a call with us today to start your CBD journey.  Cyprus – Country Overview  Cyprus is an island nation in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, known for its breathtaking natural beauty, exquisite wines, and diverse culture.  The Cypriot culture is among the oldest in the Mediterranean region. The cultural and ethnic diversity and richness of Cyprus are attributed to its time under several empires, namely Roman, Egyptian, Persian and Ottoman, and Greek, among others.  Today, Cyprus is a thriving tourist destination, and tourism pulls a significant portion of foreign exchange for the country.  Nicosia is the capital and largest city of Cyprus. Greek and Turkish are the official languages. However, English is widely spoken and understood.  For the regular folks, you’d usually have to legally reside in the country for five to seven years and demonstrate a certain monthly income, among many other requirements, to become a Cypriot citizen.  However, the process can be far quicker, straightforward, and nearly free for the lucky few with a Cypriot origin.  If you’re reading this article, chances are you’re one from the lucky club. So, without any delay, let’s get into the benefits of Cypriot citizenship by descent.  Benefits of Acquiring Cyprus Citizenship by Descent  Travel Freedom  Cyprus passport is one of the best passports in the world. It currently ranks 21st in our Nomad Passport Index. Cypriot citizens enjoy visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 168 countries, including the EU, Japan, Singapore, UAE, etc.  The government of Cyprus is working on visa waiver agreements with the US and the Schengen zone. Once approved, Cyprus’s passport will get one hell of a boost.  EU Member State  Cyprus became part of the European Union in 2004, so acquiring Cypriot citizenship is equal to getting European citizenship which will grant you the right to live, study, and work freely in any of the EU states.  Commonwealth Member State  Cyprus is also a part of the Commonwealth and enjoys stable foreign affairs with the UK and the rest of the Commonwealth nations. As commonwealth citizens, Cypriots citizens have what’s called right of abode in the UK, allowing them to live, work and even vote in elections.  Tax Benefits  In Cyprus, personal income tax is levied at progressive rates ranging from 0% to 35% (over €60,000). Foreign income for non-tax residents in Cyprus is tax-exempt.  dividend income and the first €19,500 of annual income are tax-exempt, regardless of your tax residency status.  The headline corporate income tax rate in Cyprus is 12.5%, which is lower than in most western countries.  Moreover, companies can also qualify for several tax deductions and exemptions. Through proper tax planning, living in Cyprus can be beneficial from a tax perspective.  How To Get Cyprus Citizenship By Descent?  Cypriot citizenship law primarily grants citizenship based on jus sanguinis rather than jus soli, meaning that citizenship is given based on bloodright rather than birthplace.  A person with at least one Cypriot parent usually automatically receives Cypriot citizenship regardless of the place of birth, unless one or more parents are considered illegal migrants.  If one or both parents are considered illegal migrants, citizenship may only be acquired by a Council of Ministers’ decision. This makes acquiring Cypriot citizenship difficult for children born to Turkish Cypriots married to Turkish nationals in Northern Cyprus.  For context, there are primarily two ethnic groups in Cyprus – Greek Cypriots (majority) and Turkish Cypriots (minority).  Cyprus gained independence in 1960, officially becoming the Republic of Cyprus. In 1975, Turkey established a Turkish Cypriot state on the northern part of the island. The de facto state declared independence in 1983 and named itself the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC).  So far, TRNC is only recognized by Turkey.  The Cyprus citizenship law applies to the entire island of Cyprus, including Northern Cyprus. However, the dynamic between the two countries and ethnicities can potentially create issues for Turkish Cypriots while acquiring Cypriot citizenship.  Application For Acquiring Cyprus Citizenship By Descent  The eligibility criteria for acquiring Cyprus citizenship by descent may be simple enough, but you must submit the application form that is most relevant to your situation.

The siblings' mum was one of 12 dumped in a tied-up plastic bag in a Worcestershire field at the end of last year.  The rodents - three females, three males and six babies - were discovered curled up in the bag by a dog walker near a Bewdley primary school. They were taken to the RSPCA's Birmingham Animal Centre and have since been rehomed, but before leaving one of the mice gave birth to a large litter.  The ten babies, who were all named after biscuits, have been under the charity's care since they were born in February. While three have been rehomed, it has been trickier to find new families for the remaining mice, who would make ""really nice pets"".

We have had to put them in separate cages as they did end up scuffling a bit. But they are really nice, interesting mice and they would make someone really nice pets.  “They were part of quite a large litter, which took us by surprise. To prevent unwanted pregnancies it is important to sex mice quickly and split them up otherwise their numbers can multiply, but in this case it was too late.”  Florentine is a friendly mouse who likes his wheel, while Dodger is quiet, placid and likes eating coconut. Bakewell is shy, but super quick with a penchant for rearranging his cage.

Living life a quarter mile at a time with no sleeves in sight, Vin Diesel, the hottest bald man of 2022, wearer of kilts and patron saint of sequels is back at it for his latest lap as Dom Toretto in “Fast X” the tenth installment in the “Fast & Furious,” franchise.  Diesel rose to prominence in 1998’s “Saving Private Ryan” and the first “Fast & Furious,” film, released in 2001. The OG installment followed a plot line curiously similar to “Point Break,” wherein a rookie detective goes undercover to investigate the illegal dealings of a California cool kids club.  Trading surfers for car enthusiasts, the film was an immediate hit with audiences whose taste for the operatic arc of trouble and tailgates continues to prove insatiable.  Screeching to screens on May 19, “Fast X,” sees Diesel pitted against a sociopathic long hair with a grave grudge played by Jason Momoa. BDE funny man turned heartthrob Pete Davidson is also along for the ride as are Oscar winners Helen Mirren, Charlize Theron and Brie Larson. Returning cast members include Ludacris, John Cena, Jason Statham, Michelle Rodriguez, and Jordana Brewster.  Touchingly, Meadow Walker Thornton-Allan, daughter of the late, great “Fast & Furious” star Paul Walker and goddaughter of Vin Diesel, makes a cameo appearance in the new film.  Despite the big names and unabashed joy, the Furious saga has never garnered much in terms of critical acclaim. In his reviews of of “Fast X,” The Post’s own Johnny Oleksinski writes, “I’m convinced this is the first major Hollywood film written by ChatGPT.” Ouch, bro.  Never the less, fans are faithful to the octane action, heat felt family dynamics and the high pitched siren song of the criminal underworld.  In honor of “Fast X” and the hits that keep on coming we’re looking at the stars behind the star, ladies and gentlemen Vin ‘ride of die’ Diesel. Read on to learn more.  A Cancer who knows when to shoot his shot  Tough but tender, Cancers like Vin are all heart. NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images  Vin Diesel was born Mark Sinclair on July 18, 1967, one half of a pair of fraternal twins. Fun fact: Diesel’s mum Delora Vincent is a practicing psychologic and astrologer! Diesel’s stars reveal he is a protective, feelings as facts, care as control Cancer sun with a swashbuckling, open road loving Sagittarius moon.  Diesel’s stage name is itself a microcosm of his sun and moon combination. Cancer rules maternal care, root systems, and home dynamics and Vin, an abbreviation of his mother’s married name, speaks to these associations.  Diesel, a nickname gained during his years spent as a nightclub bouncer, alludes to his high energy and built for speed moon sign.  As the sign of water logged, tear tasting nostalgia, Cancers are called back to the past and Diesel is no exception.  Vin Diesel with his late Virgo bestie Paul Walker. Bob Marshak/Original/Kobal/Shutt  As a kid he eschewed television but would watch classic movies on repeat, claiming to have watched “On the Waterfront,” a hundred times or more. In a similar pattern of return, Diesel keeps on driving and striving in his recurring “Fast & Furious” role.  Diesel’s sun and moon combo speak to him being a real private sector goofball, Cancer representing the home, the moon being the most personal of placements and Sagittarius being the sign of the slapstick, filterless comedian.  As the movie going public we’ve been privy to some of this funnyman potential in “Find Me Guilty,” “Guardians of the Galaxy,”and “The Pacifier” but my hope is that as Diesel ages, or gracefully rusts, we’ll see more of his innate hilarity.  Moon square Uranus  Recurring action star is the role Diesel was born to play. Moviestore/Shutterstock  The moon represents our instinctual, emotional nature and Uranus is the planet of the unexpected, in Diesel’s chart these two entities conflict in a square aspect indicating strong intuition and serious moodiness.  With the moon in Sagittarius and Uranus in Virgo there is a bit of a struggle between the need for autonomy and excitability and a deep craving for stability and order.  In terms of artistic expression we can see this dynamic satisfied by a consistent film series that is centered on action and edging towards and beyond personal limits.  Astrology 101: Your guide to the stars  Moon square Pluto  Vin Diesel giving face and Plutonian vibes in the eighth installment of the “Fast and Furious” franchise. Moviestore/Shutterstock  Diesel’s moon in Sagittarius also forms a square with Pluto, planet of death and transformation. This aspect suggests acute sensitivity, unblinking intensity, borderline warlock psychic attunement and unstoppable drive (car pun intended).  There is nothing half way or remotely subtle about Pluto and in relationship to the moon, our emotional home base, Pluto can show up as a consuming need for safety, security and nourishment. Perhaps this need is answered in Diesel’s choice to reprise his roles as Dom Toretto, Riddick, Groot and XXX, respectively.  There is comfort in return, stability in the familiar and a guaranteed pay day promised by a franchise film. The presence of Pluto combined with Diesel’s ‘nest hard’ Cancer sun helps to explain the allegedly ‘absurd’ measures he has taken to protect his home and family. In the cardinal waters of Cancer, you can never be too safe nor can a perimeter be too secure.  Jupiter trine Saturn  Vin Diesel has Jupiter, planet of expansion in the stage centric sign of Leo. WireImage  Diesel’s Jupiter, planet of luck and loose living is in Leo, the sign of the stage and the natural habitat of performers.  Jupiter expands everything it touches and in the sign of Leo the jolly gas giant lends his good juju to Diesel’s serious star power, likely helping him become one of the highest grossing actors of his generation and generate a net worth of $205 million, according to Parade.  The planet of fortune forms a harmonious, good vibe trine with Saturn, the planet of hard work and tough love, and daddy vibes.  With this aspect the indication is that hard work pays off exponentially, the grind is gold if you will and Diesel proves the point.  Here’s to keeping your foot on the gas, your resplendent dome shining and your bank roll rolling, Vin, we love to see it.

"birth","2023-10-01","Not Discerned","{""Liverpool"", ""Liverpool"", ""UnitedKingdom""}","2023-05-19T11:55:17","The Sands and Tommy’s charities’ Joint Policy Unit have published their Saving Babies’ Lives Progress Report. The report is the first in a series of progress reports in which the charities will call on government, the NHS and professional bodies to do more to reduce the UK’s unacceptable rates of miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm birth and neonatal death.  Using data from respected sources, including MBRRACE-UK, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) and the National Perinatal Mortality Review Tool (PMRT), the charities warn that mortality rates are now heading in the wrong direction and experiences of care are deteriorating. The government’s stated commitment to act on the findings of recent maternity reviews hasn’t led to the change that is needed to save more babies’ lives.  The report emphasises that pregnancy loss, stillbirth and neonatal death must not be accepted as inevitable. Too many families are suffering the loss of a baby. With better care, many of these babies would have survived.  How many babies die during pregnancy or around the time of birth in the UK?  Every year in the UK, more than 5,000 babies are stillborn or die within the first four weeks of life, and at least 1 in 6 pregnancies end in miscarriage. In 2021, 13 babies each day were stillborn or died within their first 28 days of life.  In England, the government has set a target to halve the rates of stillbirth by 2025 compared to 2010 rates, but this target is unlikely to be achieved. An interim target of 20% reduction in stillbirths by 2020 was achieved, but stillbirth rates increased again (to 4.1 per 1000 births) in 2021. The report notes that the impact of covid-19 on pregnancy outcomes during this time remains unclear but points out that, even before 2020, progress in England was already considered too slow to achieve the targeted 50% reduction in stillbirths by 2025.  The extended perinatal mortality rate, which includes stillbirths and neonatal (newborn) deaths, increased in 2021 after a reduction in previous years. Newborn (neonatal) mortality for babies of 24 weeks or longer gestation also increased in 2021 after a previous reduction. England is unlikely to achieve the government’s original target of a 50% reduction by 2025 in neonatal deaths across all gestational ages which, if successful, would have led to 1,700 fewer deaths between 2022 and 2025.  There has also been little progress in reducing the numbers of babies who are born preterm (premature). Around 50,000 babies are born prematurely in the UK each year. This is significant because prematurity is a major risk factor for pregnancy loss and baby death. In 2020, nearly three quarters of the newborn babies who died in the UK had been born prematurely.  The charities point out that the outcomes for babies must also be considered alongside worsening maternal death rates, and the quality and safety and parents’ experience of their care. The report highlighted that in addition to falling behind its own national targets, the UK’s maternal mortality rate was rated one of the worst out of eight European countries in a recent study, and is almost four times higher than that of Norway and Denmark.  What causes stillbirth and neonatal deaths?  In 2021, the causes of 33% of stillbirths and 7% of neonatal deaths were unknown. The most common cause of stillbirth in 2020 was placental. Two thirds of newborn babies died from neonatal complications, including extreme prematurity, cardio-respiratory and neurological problems.  In 2021-22, nearly a fifth of stillbirths could have been avoided if the mother had received a better standard of care. The National Perinatal Mortality Review Tool (PMRT) identified 168 care issues in 2021-22 which probably affected the outcome for stillborn or newborn babies who died, with a further 642 care issues identified which may have made a difference to the fatal outcomes. Care issues included delay in diagnosis or inappropriate management of significant medical, surgical or social problems during pregnancy, inadequate monitoring of fetal growth and information for mothers about reduced fetal movements, failures related to risk assessment, investigations, fetal monitoring, and inappropriate birth location and mode of birth, and issues with respiratory management in neonatal care. Poor observation and monitoring of the mother during labour was highlighted as a concern both by the PMRT and by a CQC maternity survey in 2022 in which a quarter of mothers reported being left alone by midwives or doctors at a worrying time whilst in labour.  What are the risk factors for pregnancy loss, stillbirth or neonatal death?  The report highlighted some characteristics of mothers and babies which are known to increase the likelihood of pregnancy loss, stillbirth or newborn (neonatal) death. Whilst these characteristics increase the risk of complications or a poor outcome, they should be recognised and managed through appropriate, personalised care. Accurate and ongoing assessment and management of the mother’s and baby’s risk factors are essential aspects of safe maternity and neonatal care.  Low birthweight has the most significant effect on stillbirth and neonatal deaths, with the highest death rates among very low birthweight babies weighing less than 1,500g. Twins and multiple birth babies have higher stillbirth and neonatal death rates and are also at higher risk of being born with lower birthweights.  Mothers’ who are younger than 20 or older than 35 have the highest age-related risk of losing a stillborn or newborn baby. Possible reasons for older women include declining uterine function affecting contractions, and increasing numbers of multiple pregnancies from fertility treatment. Adolescent mothers are at greater risk of giving birth to babies who are very preterm or have an extremely low birthweight.  Very low (underweight) or high BMI (obesity) mothers have an increased risk of pregnancy loss and baby death. In addition, obesity is associated with health conditions such as diabetes and hypertension, which increase the risk of poor pregnancy outcomes. One in five pregnant women in the UK have multiple pre-existing conditions which increase their risk, including cardiovascular disease, epilepsy, diabetes, poor mental health, special educational needs and disabilities. Smoking is associated with increased rates of stillbirth, miscarriage and birth defects.  Ethnicity and social deprivation are also associated with stark increases in stillbirth and newborn death rates for Black and Asian babies and families living in the UK’s most deprived areas. The risk of preterm birth and miscarriage is also higher for those from minority ethnic groups. Factors which may influence these persisting inequalities include access to health services, communication, the relationship between women and their midwives, cultural and religious preferences, and social needs. The report points out that while there is a target for NHS England to reduce overall stillbirth, neonatal deaths and preterm births by 50% in 2025, there is no target to reduce inequalities for different ethnic groups. The current disparity in stillbirth and neonatal mortality rates means that the national target cannot be achieved without significantly greater reductions in baby deaths amongst the worst affected ethnic groups.  Conclusions from the Sands and Tommy’s Saving Babies’ Lives Progress Report  The Saving Babies’ Lives Progress Report highlights the disappointing lack of progress that has been made towards reducing pregnancy loss, stillbirth and neonatal mortality.  It describes an increasingly unsafe maternity healthcare environment in which nationally agreed standards of care are too often not followed, contributing to avoidable deaths. Staff are working in an increasingly under-resourced and over-stretched system which is having an impact on people’s experience of care. NHS trusts are not learning from mistakes that have resulted in families losing their babies’ or mothers’ lives, and the voices of bereaved parents are not being heard or acted upon. National targets have done nothing to address the glaring inequalities between outcomes for families of minority ethnicity or those living in areas of deprivation, despite multiple reports highlighting their poor experience whilst accessing health services.

"birth","2007-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Moscow"", ""Moscow"", ""Russia""}","2023-05-19T10:49:20","Thirty-five states have fewer children than they did five years ago, a situation caused by declining birth rates nationwide, but also by young families migrating across state borders in search of cheaper housing.  Even in the 15 states that gained children, all but North Dakota experienced greater growth in the adult population, meaning children now make up a lower percentage of residents.  In states where the number of children has declined, school officials are facing the possibility of teacher layoffs or even school closures when pandemic aid expires next year. A decline in school enrollment could provide short-term cost savings and might be a benefit to children if there are more resources to go around, but it bodes poorly for future state workforces.  In states where the drop in the number of children is part of a broader population decline, there will be additional fiscal, economic and political ramifications, such as diminished representation in Congress.  The states with the largest drops were California, Illinois and New Mexico, where the child population declined by 6% between 2017 and 2022, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data. Idaho and North Dakota saw the largest increases, at 4%.  This article was originally published on Stateline  The declines mostly are a reflection of historically low fertility rates, which have been below the replacement rate of two children per woman since 2010. Births increased in only a handful of states in 2021.  But in the 35 states that experienced declines, high housing prices also are a factor. In California, jobs pay well but the state’s housing shortage has sent prices beyond the means of young families, said Hans Johnson, a senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California, a nonpartisan think tank.  “People want to buy a house and have children, but they realize they can’t do it here so they look in the vicinity, states close by, and work remotely so they can keep their California paychecks,” Johnson said.  Slow population growth cost California a seat in Congress after the 2020 census. The number of adults in California grew in the past five years, according to the Stateline analysis, but the decline in the number of children led to a lower overall population.  California also has experienced a phenomenon shared by other Western states: The children of Hispanic immigrants have lower birth rates than their parents. California’s total fertility rate dropped from 2.15 per woman in 2008 to a historic low of 1.52 in 2020, the lowest since records have been kept, Johnson wrote in a January report.  California, Illinois and New Mexico all have seen lower school enrollment in recent years, even as they’ve tried to rekindle interest in public education after pandemic upheavals.  New Mexico experience  In New Mexico, enrollment has dropped particularly sharply in the northwestern part of the state, where there are many Indigenous students, according to a January state report. Between 2012 and 2022, enrollment declined by 22% in the majority-Native Central Consolidated Schools in San Juan County, compared with a statewide decline of 7%, according to the report. Indigenous and other children in the mostly rural area struggle to stay in school because of long bus commutes and lack of internet access at home.  The recent closure of a coal mine and the power generating station it fueled forced many families with children to move away from San Juan County to find jobs, according to Central Consolidated school board President Christina Aspaas.  “A lot of Navajo workers who were employed had to relocate to Phoenix or elsewhere out of state to earn the same wages,” Aspaas said. “It affected the local tribes, Hopi and Navajo, Diné. Seeing the impacts makes my heart break. These are all my children, and they deserve the best in education and in life.”  In Idaho and North Dakota, annual school enrollment has increased over the past five years, except for temporary drops early in the pandemic. But Idaho is bracing for a decline starting in 2025, when children from a historic 2007 baby boom in the state start turning 18.  Need to get in touch? Have a news tip? CONTACT US  Idaho has become known as a picturesque and affordable place to raise children, said Jaap Vos, a planning professor at the University of Idaho in Boise. He relocated from Florida with his 3-year-old son in 2012, “when it was still the middle of nowhere,” he said. The number of adults in the state grew by 16% during the same period.  Boise is getting a lot of new residents from California, and northern Idaho is seeing more movers from Northern California, Washington and Utah. “It might be for ideological reasons, people looking for a more conservative lifestyle,” Vos said. He added that some people have left Boise as it has grown more crowded.  Housing problems increase  Even in northern Idaho, housing prices have risen rapidly.  Writer Leah Hampton is moving from North Carolina to Moscow in northern Idaho to teach at the University of Idaho. But she said she is having trouble finding an affordable house — even without children. Her husband is working remotely.  “Moscow is definitely a great place to raise kids. It’s like a 1950s movie up here but more diverse and left wing,” Hampton said. “All of my friends’ children seem really happy and well-adjusted. But cost of living is much higher than we expected. We have money and we literally can’t find anything to buy.”  Many houses are sold sight unseen to investors offering cash, she said.  Another fast-growing state with meager growth in the number of children is Florida, where a decrease in births and an increase in deaths over the past five years has created a negative drag on overall population, according to census estimates. The state had almost 25,000 more births than deaths in 2017, but there were 40,000 more deaths than births by 2022.  Still, Florida had the third-highest increase in child population between 2017 and 2022, at 2%. One reason: Hispanic births in Florida have continued to increase, unlike in Western states, said Stefan Rayer, director of the population program at the state Bureau of Economic and Business Research. In fact, births are increasing for white, Black and Hispanic mothers in Florida, helping to offset some of the increasing deaths among the white population, Rayer said.  “Unless births increase substantially, because of the aging of Florida’s population, the state will likely see natural decrease for the foreseeable future, with all growth coming from migration,” Rayer said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuYWNhcGl0YWxjaHJvbmljbGUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTkvbG93LWZlcnRpbGl0eS1yYXRlcy1oaWdoLWhvdXNpbmctcHJpY2VzLW1lYW4tZmV3ZXItY2hpbGRyZW4taW4tbW9zdC1zdGF0ZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"birth","2023-05-18","10:00:00","{""Charleston"", ""SouthCarolina"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T08:08:00","The United States is in the middle of a maternal health crisis and is the only developing nation with worsening birth outcomes for moms and babies, according to Charleston maternal health care professionals.  South Carolina is no exception.  The 2022 March of Dimes Report Card gave South Carolina an F grade based on indicators such as preterm birth, infant mortality, low-risk cesarean births and inadequate prenatal care, which refers to births before 37 weeks of gestation. A normal pregnancy is 37 to 42 weeks.  “We have to look at caring for moms first,” said Simone Lee, a certified lactation counselor, Lamaze childbirth educator and doula. “Education begins prenatally, and if our moms and our babies aren’t getting the best care and the best outcomes in that perinatal state, then that leads to a domino effect of poor outcomes for children later on.”  Lee is co-founder and director of maternal and fetal outcomes of the Beloved Early Education and Care (BEE) Collective in downtown Charleston. It is a multifaceted nonprofit organization that focuses on maternal health resources, advocacy and education services. It seeks to enact changes to reduce the maternal health crisis, Lee said.  Preterm birth rates on the rise, data show  The March of Dimes report from its Perinatal Data Center indicates South Carolina has a higher infant mortality rate than the U.S. standard, Lee said, and there has been no improvement in the state’s percentage of babies born preterm.  Charleston County has a 11.6% preterm birth rate, which indicates about one in nine babies born in 2021 were preterm, according to the March of Dimes report. The preterm birth rate in South Carolina has steadily climbed since 2014, increasing from 10.8% to 12.1% statewide in 2021. The nationwide preterm birth rate for 2021 is 10.5%.  The report also found the rate of preterm birth in Charleston County is highest for Black infants at 18.3%, which is nearly double the percentage of White infants at 9.3%. South Carolina has a rate of 6.5 infant deaths per 1,000 live births, which is also above the national average of 5.4 infant deaths per 1,000 live births.  South Carolina also has a higher percentage of low-risk cesarean births than the national average, Lee said, with 27% of births designated low-risk cesareans. The majority of low-risk cesareans are often medically unnecessary, she said, and can lead to medical complications.  One of the main issues the BEE Collective confronts is maternal mortality (death) and morbidity (illness/disease), she said.  “We want to be able to make sure that everyone has good outcomes regardless of their background, income and circumstances — that they have the support and are able to understand what leads to good outcomes in pregnancy, labor and delivery,” Lee said.  “We also understand that Black and brown moms are three to four times more likely to die than their White counterparts. And this isn’t just nationwide, this is something that we see here in this area as well.”  Inadequate maternal  health care  The BEE Collective has encountered worsening outcomes for moms and babies since the Covid-19 pandemic, Lee said.  “One of the things that I would attribute to it is there were a lot of times when moms had to go into hospitals and doctor appointments by themselves,” she said. “So when we restrict individuals from having labor support people or their husbands or partners with them, we have worsening outcomes.”  Lee said the U.S. public health system doesn’t necessarily highlight the importance of how hormones affect labor and delivery. If a woman is not feeling safe in her delivery location, then her stressed body produces increased adrenaline, which is the fight-or-flight hormone. That can cause stress, which can lead to early labor, among other negative outcomes.  “There are a lot of areas where people don’t get the access to maternal care they actually need,” Lee said, “so we have these deserts where people just don’t have [access to] providers [of] quality care.”  Another factor measured in the March of Dimes report is the percentage of inadequate prenatal care. According to the March of Dimes report, 18% of pregnant South Carolina women in 2021 did not receive adequate prenatal care, which is defined by the percentage of women who receive less than 50% the appropriate number of visits for the infant’s gestational age or who did not receive care until the fifth month of pregnancy or later.  “We have so many families who aren’t getting adequate prenatal care,” Lee said.  Expanding Medicaid to cover doula and midwifery services could be a key factor in lowering that percentage. Doulas are trained to support the physical and emotional needs of pregnant people before, during and after birth. Doula care reduces chances of infection, low preterm birth rates and postpartum depression, and increases breastfeeding health, newborn health and overall satisfaction with delivery.  “We have to look at ways to make doulas a staple not only nationwide, but specifically here in the Lowcountry region.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vY2hhcmxlc3RvbmNpdHlwYXBlci5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8xOS9jaGFybGVzdG9uLWNvdW50eS1pbi1tYXRlcm5hbC1oZWFsdGgtY3Jpc2lzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Both were deserving of the honor, but Nick Cannon could only call one name as the winner. Ultimately, the audience decided that Medusa, a.k.a. singer Bishop Briggs, edged out American Idol veteran David Archuleta under his Macaw mask with her powerful vocals. It was an amazing win for Briggs, who told CinemaBlend she took on the show not long after welcoming her first child.  Bishop Briggs welcomed her son in August and not too long after was in costume as Medusa and performing on The Masked Singer. Briggs addressed the challenges:  The pressure is for sure on. I was also, during filming, I was five months and then six months postpartum. So I was pumping. I mean, I was doing all the things in between the show. So it really was a whirlwind.  As Medusa, Bishop Briggs faced some stiff competition. She had a nail-biter battle royale round with singer Sara Evans (who shared her take on her own elimination) as Mustang, but ultimately edged out a win. Briggs would get another scare two episodes later when she was eliminated after losing to California Roll.  The elimination would've meant Bishop Briggs exiting before a bulk of Season 9's eliminated contestants, but she could've been with her infant son more frequently again. Briggs talked about the possibility of that happening and broke down what was going through her mind before she was saved by the Ding Dong Keep It On Bell:  I will say that when I had that moment with The California Roll, I felt so defeated. When Nicole [Scherzinger] rang that bell–this is the thing. I don't know how long the [audience] chant is of the ‘Take it off’, but it felt like six hours. I went through every moment on the show. I mean, you realize how much you want something when you feel as though it's about to be taken away. And because I had time away from my son because I was a previous fan of the show. That competitive spirit really came out not so much with competing with others but with myself.  Readers that rewatch the moment with their Hulu subscription will see Bishop Briggs was really emotional when Nicole Scherzinger and the rest of the panel decided to give her a second chance. It ended up being a great save by the panel, as Briggs later went on to defeat California Roll and, of course, ultimately won The Masked Singer.  Being a first-time parent is a unique experience, and Bishop Briggs shared that working on The Masked Singer helped in a couple of ways, as well as how her son reacted to seeing her win and how he felt about it:  I think it was really, really helpful to have such an immersive set experience, if that makes sense. And, you know, I feel so soulfully fulfilled when I sing… But that being said, was I on Facetime with the baby who doesn't even talk? Yes. Was I writing notes to the baby? Yes. I was over the top… I did show him the finale last night, and he truly had no reaction. It was a very interesting moment because I had dedicated so much of the show to him, and he didn't seem to care. But he is only nine months old. So, I understand. He did smile at the Macaw though, which I think is very telling to what his preference was.  Ouch – it must be rough to realize your kid wasn't rooting for you! Jokes aside, Bishop Briggs was a phenomenal performer all throughout Season 9. Her win might've been a bummer for American Idol fans who wanted to see David Archuleta take home the Golden Mask, but Medusa's narrow victories were a testament to her talent as well as the talent of the other competitors.  The Masked Singer will return to Fox in the fall for Season 10. Now would be a perfect time to check out the 2023 TV schedule, as there are plenty of new shows arriving in the summer that will be worth a watch for anyone looking to fill a gap on Wednesday nights.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaW5lbWFibGVuZC5jb20vaW50ZXJ2aWV3cy9iaXNob3AtYnJpZ2dzLW9wZW5zLXVwLWFib3V0LXRoZS1jaGFsbGVuZ2VzLW9mLWZpbG1pbmctdGhlLW1hc2tlZC1zaW5nZXItbW9udGhzLWFmdGVyLWdpdmluZy1iaXJ0aNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

But he hasn't spoken to the twin daughters he shares with ex, Kate Gosselin, in nine years, and it's been four years since he's spoken with his other four children. ""The last time I spoke to Mady and Cara was 2014,"" the former ""Jon & Kate Plus 8"" star told The Sun this week. Mady and Cara, 22, are the eldest of Jon and Kate's kids, and have been estranged from their dad in the wake of their parents' long and bitter custody battle. ""I periodically text Mady and Cara to see if I get a response, and at this point, I've never heard from them,"" Jon said. He and Kate also share sextuplets; Hannah and Collin live with their dad, while Aaden, Joel, Alexis and Leah live with their mom and remain estranged from Jon. ""I am attending Hannah and Collin's graduation. We will have a graduation party for Hannah and Collin sometime in the near future after their actual graduation date. Sadly I won't be attending the other kids' high school graduation. The last time I spoke to [them] was in 2018,"" Jon said. ""I will never give up trying to talk to my children. I'm hoping with social media that maybe they might reach out to me at some point, he added. ""The door is always open to rekindle any kind of relationship. I've tried for years for any interaction with any of my other kids, but nothing yet.""  True 'Flowers' inspiration revealed Miley Cyrus is clarifying those theories about the relationship between her hit single ""Flowers"" and her ex, Liam Hemsworth. With lyrics like ""I can love me better than you can"" and references to moving on from what was once a good as ""gold"" romance until the couple watched their house ""burn,"" the track immediately spawned fan assumptions that it was inspired by her 2020 divorce from Liam after 10 years together. Turns out, it's not quite that simple. ""I never need to be a master at the craft of tricking an audience. It will set itself on fire all by itself,"" Miley says when asked about the connection in British Vogue's June 2023 cover story. ""I wrote it in a really different way,"" she continues. ""The chorus was originally: 'I can buy myself flowers, write my name in the sand, but I can't love me better than you can.' It used to be more, like, 1950s. The saddest song. Like: 'Sure, I can be my own lover, but you're so much better.'"" She decided to give it an edit, though. ""The song is a little fake it till you make it. Which I'm a big fan of,"" she says. In the end, Vogue concludes the singer, now 30, ""is allergic"" to the notion of listeners attributing any of her latest music to one specific relationship, because that's not how her writing works. Looking back on the end of her relationship with Liam — whose name she never uses in the interview — Miley says, ""I wouldn't erase my story or want it to be erased,"" then adds, ""Having an interesting life makes for interesting storytelling.""  Another legal victory Ed Sheeran just won his second copyright lawsuit of the month. Both suits stem from allegations the singer lifted ideas from Marvin Gaye's 1973 classic, ""Let's Get It On,"" and incorporated them into his hit, ""Thinking out Loud."" While the first suit was brought by the family of Marvin's co-writer Edward Townsend, the second was filed against Ed by Structured Asset Sales LLC, which owns one-third of the copyright to ""Let's Get It On,"" according to CNN. After a trial jury in New York City found Ed wrote ""Thinking Out Loud"" ""independently,"" a federal district judge tossed the second suit, the outlet reported Thursday, May 18, one day after Federal District Judge Lewis Stanton's ruling was handed down. The judge determined Ed's use of a similar chord progression and harmonic rhythm doesn't warrant copyright protection because, ""The selection and arrangement of these two musical elements in 'Let's Get It On' is now commonplace and thus their combination is unprotectable."" Ed was previously sued for $20 million over claims he stole elements from a 2012 song called ""Amazing"" that was performed by ""The X Factor"" star Matt Cardle and used them in his 2015 track, ""Photograph."" Ed and the songwriters reached a settlement — and Matt publicly defended Ed, calling him ""a genius.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFodHRwczovL3d3dy53b25kZXJ3YWxsLmNvbS9jZWxlYnJpdHkvZ3JhbW15LXdpbm5pbmctZmxvd2Vycy1zaW5nZXItZmluYWxseS1yZXZlYWxzLWlmLWFjdG9yLWV4LW90aGVyLXBhc3QtcmVsYXRpb25zaGlwcy1pbnNwaXJlZC1uZXctbXVzaWMtbW9yZS1uZXdzLTczOTg3NC5nYWxsZXJ50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Though it is generally recommended to register your baby with a health insurance prior to giving birth to save yourself the admin headache during recovery and bonding time, you can also take out health insurance after birth – though this could have financial consequences.  In any case, you should do this no later than three months after welcoming your baby.  When taking out basic health insurance after birth, your baby will be insured retrospectively from their birth. This also means that the premiums must be paid retrospectively up to the entire month of birth.  You must also inform your own health insurance of your new arrival. Note that your baby does not have to be registered with the same health insurance as you or your partner.  Are there any consequences to taking out basic health insurance for my baby after birth?  No, there are no financial consequences to taking out basic health insurance for your newborn following the birth, provided you do so within the necessary time frame.  What about supplementary health insurance?  While taking out basic health insurance will – hassle aside - play out the same way before and after the birth, this is not the case for (voluntary) supplementary health insurance.  Advertisement  In Switzerland, you are strongly recommended to register with a basic health insurance company during your pregnancy as this will enable you to take out supplementary health insurance for your baby at the same time. Some insurance companies, such as Concordia (100 francs), will even give you a so-called baby bonus.  Further to this, when registering your baby with a health insurance company for basic health coverage you will not be asked to provide any health check for your (unborn) baby.  However, when taking out supplementary health insurance after your child’s birth, the insurer will collect information about your baby’s health in the form of an extensive survey – similar to those adults in Switzerland have to fill out when registering with an insurance company.  This means that should your baby be born ill or with a disability, the insurance company can impose restrictions on the benefits they are to receive, or worse, refuse to sign a contract for your baby altogether.  According to a 2019 article by Swiss broadcasting company SRF, most Swiss supplementary health insurance companies will almost always reject a baby that is born with a disability as they consider them a ‘bad risk’.  You will also have to inform the insurance company of any illness or disability that has been detected during antenatal screening tests, in which case the insurer may again refuse to take your baby on.  However, note that the health insurance company is not allowed to request antenatal screening tests. Parents must only declare the results with the insurance if they have it.  In general, it is advisable to have your baby insured between the 4th and 8th month of your pregnancy.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWxvY2FsLmNoLzIwMjMwNTE5L2V4cGxhaW5lZC1zaG91bGQtaS10YWtlLW91dC1zd2lzcy1oZWFsdGgtaW5zdXJhbmNlLWJlZm9yZS1vci1hZnRlci10aGUtYmlydGgtb2YtbXktYmFiedIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Her husband, chess grandmaster Gawain Jones,​ announced the death in a social media post.  He described her as an “incredible and cherished mother”, beloved wife, daughter, and sister  “She leaves behind a loving family who will miss her greatly,” he said.

British chess player, international master Malcolm Pein​, said the news was “dreadfully sad”, coming not long after the birth of Maroroa Jones’ second child, Daniel.  Supplied Sue Maroroa Jones’ family believe she may have been the first female Pasifika chess play to represent New Zealand internationally.  New Zealand Chess Federation president Nigel Metge told the NZ Herald the death came as shock.  “It’s a loss on many levels, a woman who had done well here and then ... flourishing overseas and just suddenly taken from us.”  Bill Forster from the New Zealand Chess Federation described Maroroa Jones as “an intuitive player, eschewing deep study but excelling at attack, tactics, and fast time controls”.  Forster said Sue loved all kinds of games, and in any contest of pure mental dexterity against her, chances were “you’d be put to the sword in double quick time”.  Ross Giblin/Stuff Sue Maroroa Jones is survived by her husband Gawain Jones and their two children Samaria and Daniel.  He said she made an impact on the New Zealand chess community early, coming from a family of keen players. She first played at Auckland's Papatoetoe club, then Howick, and the Auckland Chess Centre.  In a statement to Stuff, Maroroa Jones’ family said she became a chess player by accident at 10, when her father, Temu, unexpectedly had to take her and brother Andrew with him to the Auckland Chess Centre.  There, a club member noticed Maroroa Jones “looking bored” and asked if she knew how to play, “resulting in Sue’s first step in her chess career”.  Only a year later, was selected for the New Zealand Women’s Olympiad team for Bled 2002.  Her achievements included becoming joint NZ Junior Champion in 2008, earning three FIDE [The International Chess Federation] titles; Woman Candidate Master in 2005, Woman FIDE Master in 2007, Woman international Master in 2009, and played for New Zealand in five consecutive Olympiads from 2002 until 2010.  Maroroa Jones’ family believe she may have been the first Pasifika woman to represent New Zealand internationally in chess.  “A proud Kiwi, Sue also acknowledged her Chinese-Malaysian and Cook Island background growing up in South Auckland.”  She moved to England after marrying Gawain Jones, Forster said. There, she helped to manage his career so he could focus on chess.  Forster said although she had played less in recent times, her immense unfulfilled potential was always apparent when she did play.  London’s Hammersmith Chess Club said it was a day of mourning, after losing someone who was a dear friend to many.  “She was... an inspiration on and off the board. Words cannot do a situation like this justice.”  In a tribute from Sheffield Rugby Union Football Club, Emily Glendenning said Maroroa Jones was never without a smile – and a tin of delicious home baking.  She played for the club for five seasons, joining in 2015, before retiring to have her first child in June 2020.  ”Typical of any New Zealander, Sue was passionate about rugby. She was a determined back rower who loved causing a nuisance at the breakdown.”  She was a development officer and Captain of the Roses, and helped to grow women’s rugby by “being an incredibly welcoming and friendly face to all newcomers”.  “Sue formed lasting friendships with her teammates and will be greatly missed by everyone.”  Supplied Maroroa Jones’ family said she loved to travel, and her early success in chess gave her the opportunity to see the world.  She is survived by her husband Gawain Jones and their two children.  “A dedicated mother to Samaria and Daniel, she always wanted to be a mum and was excited for the arrival of each of her children,” Maroroa Jones’ family said.  The cause of her death is yet to be determined.  Maroroa Jones also loved baking and sharing her baked goods with friends and family.  “You could always find nice pastries or cakes in her home kitchen.”  She was described as a “charismatic person who was willing to help anyone”.  “Sue’s friends appreciated her encouraging nature, seen as the ‘mum figure’ who offered advice the way mums do.  “Sue was well-loved by many, her death was a complete shock and is a heavy loss for her husband, kids, family, friends and everyone who knew her. She will be deeply missed.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0dWZmLmNvLm56L25hdGlvbmFsLzMwMDg3Nzk2NC9raXdpLWNoZXNzLWdyZWF0LXN1ZS1tYXJvcm9hLWpvbmVzLWRpZXMtYWdlZC0zMi1hZnRlci1iaXJ0aC1vZi1zZWNvbmQtY2hpbGTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Despite vacillating economic conditions between and across markets, that statistic has remained consistent for 30 years. A new study from the Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal suggests an elegant explanation: a business’s long-term success depends significantly on its founding conditions not just changes in its markets.  “A venture’s performance following environmental change depends on its internal processes,” says D. Carrington Motley, an instructor in entrepreneurship at Carnegie Mellon University and co-author of the study. “Environmental conditions at a business’s founding shape those processes, and they quickly become cemented and embedded in beliefs about how to operate.”  Motley and his co-authors, Charles E. Eesley of Stanford and Wesley Koo of INSEAD Asia, examined performance for more than 1,000 ventures founded from 1960 to 2011. The businesses operated in 19 industries ranging from agriculture to energy and utilities. The authors used data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis to quantify dynamism within each industry over time and within each venture’s founding year. They used alumni survey data to establish the composition of each business’s founding team as well as its longevity and ultimate outcome.  “Businesses founded in dynamic environments by a functionally diverse team show meaningfully more ability to survive during market change,” Eesley said. “However, they don’t necessarily have an increased likelihood of a positive exit.”  Businesses founded in dynamic environments typically favor slower, decentralized decision-making and increased creativity and flexibility. A founding team with many distinct functional roles compounds these behaviors — they have broader strategic focus and seek large amounts of information. These risk-averse structures and strategies help businesses persevere during environmental change, but the study also found that these businesses where less likely to gain IPOs or acquisitions if their market stabilized.  “In stable, more predictable environments, being more aggressive can produce better outcomes,” Woo said. “The risk of untested assumptions is less, so continued use of risk-averse processes produces fewer benefits and may detract from a venture’s ability to respond to opportunities.”  The authors argue that the key differentiator for businesses founded in dynamic environments by functionally diverse teams was slower decision-making. They tested the theory by first examining their performance in industries where fast product development was critical to competitive advantage and second by determining how quickly they took to receive angel or venture capital funding. Businesses founded in dynamic environments by functionally diverse teams fared worse in both instances.  Whether an industry is in flux or stabilizing, the study indicates that typically businesses benefit from market change only if that change better aligns with their founding environment. Despite its premise that founding processes become entrenched, it offers an insight to entrepreneurs hoping to both survive chaos and thrive in calm. Businesses need to examine their founding structure and internal processes and consistently re-evaluate whether they are best suited to their market environment.

Many people look forward to their birthday each year but one tot very nearly had a whole different one fabricated shortly after they were born.  Their dad had been at the hospital waiting when his child was born and went to fill out the paperwork with one of the nurses. However, things did not go as smoothly as they might have done when he came out with an unusual request.  The dad took to Reddit to ask what people thought. Credit: Pixabay  Advert 10  This did not go down well with staff at the hospital. The situation even saw a paediatrician intervene and allegedly raise their voice in an attempt to tell the new father that his request was not possible.  Taking to the Reddit forum Am I the A**hole, the new dad explained that 2020 had been a very difficult year for him. It had seen him lose his father and a close friend and, to make matters worse, he had also lost his job, saying he wished the year had 'never happened'.  Despite all this, it seemed the year had ended on a high, as his partner gave birth to his child at 11.05pm on New Year's Eve.  But the new dad was so determined to avoid association with that year that he requested the time of birth be recorded at 12.05am instead of 11.05pm. This would have meant his child would be recorded as being born just five minutes into 2021 instead of in the last hour of 2020.  Advert 10  He asked to change his child's date of birth. Credit: Design Pics / Alamy  He recounted his conversation with medics about the request, saying: ""I argued with her about it and told her that she was making a huge deal out of it.

So adding 2021 would make more sense. After she tried to argue with me telling me that what I was doing is considered forgery and would cause a huge issue because it's not just an hour, I was changing the date as well.

Coined “Coachella for birth workers and families,” the Doula Expo is an annual culture-shifting festival that caters to birth professionals and mamas (and their broods) and centers a vision for the future of birth work. Mama Glow Founder Latham Thomas (one of Oprah’s Super Soul 100) will be joined by actress and maternal health advocate Tatyana Ali, who will be the festival’s emcee, with music provided by DJ Rashida. For expectant mothers and families, The Doula Expo is a safe space where participants can access resources, meet practitioners, and experience products and services from brands and organizations in the maternal and infant health spaces. Additionally, attendees will be able to learn from leading industry experts, make new connections, expand their birth village and be empowered.  Thomas wanted to create the Doula Expo to center the discussion of Black women’s birthing experiences. She wanted to do this while creating a community. “The Doula Expo is the first and only event of its kind centering and celebrating a vision for the future of birth work. This is our third festival in two years. We started in Bushwick, Brooklyn, in a 6,000-square-foot space, where we hosted 400 attendees, then grew into a 16,000-square-foot space in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and we are hosting the 2023 Doula Expo in a 60,000-square-foot space in Hudson Yards, Manhattan. The Doula Expo was born out of a need to gather community post-Covid-19. We wanted to bring together folks from the birth community, caregivers, and families impacted by the pandemic,” she says to ESSENCE.  Syed Aqeen  Thomas continues, “There is a nationwide imperative to expand the doula workforce as a response to the current maternal health crisis in the U.S. We believe in centering the power of community, imagination, joy, and unique problem-solving as we work together to design a future where birth is safe, affordable, and equitable. This event elevates important conversations and convenes people from all walks of life and industry with the desire to improve maternal health outcomes.”  For birth professionals, including doulas and care providers, The Doula Expo is an opportunity to convene with peers and industry leaders, develop authentic connections, and build community with other birth professionals. The festival is designed to help participants amplify their work, connect with organizations, and grow their businesses.  This year’s theme is “Birth to the Future,” as the Mama Glow community is leaning into principles and thought leadership that explores the imagination, hope, and futuristic possibilities for reproductive justice and birth equity, amid the bleak and harrowing maternal mortality crisis statistics as Black women are three times more likely to die from a pregnancy-related cause than white women, according to the CDC. Aside from that, many Black mothers report not feeling heard by their providers, including during delivery. Unfortunately, the festival’s emcee, Ali, had that experience with the traumatic birth of her first son. In her heartfelt 2020 ESSENCE essay, she recounted her birthing story and called out the patriarchal behavior and views that allow other Black mothers’ stories to be hidden, dismissed, and ignored.  Ali believes the Doula Expo can empower mothers to be transparent about their birth stories, whether harrowing or not. “We’ll all be together for a common cause, to ask questions, to learn. The reason it’s important to share our stories is for healing. It’s also important to share our stories because it’s not our shame to carry whatever our stories are. We can learn from each other,” she says.  Article continues after video.  Thomas shares a similar sentiment. “It’s important to have a festival like this because birth is sacred and should be celebrated. Black mothers and birthing people deserve to feel joy. They should be looking forward to their birth and not hold a fear that something may happen to them. The Doula Expo is a reminder that we matter—Black joy matters. Black birth matters,” she states.  Ahead of the festival, we sat down with Ali to chat about the importance of birth equity, her activism work amid the maternal mortality crisis, and how all mothers can reclaim their joy.  ESSENCE: What does it mean to you to host the Doula Expo?  Tatyana Ali: I’ve known Latham Thomas, the founder of Mama Glow, for many years and she’s a dear friend. The work she’s doing with her nonprofit is incredible and important. After the first traumatic birthing experience that I’ve had, and after also having the most incredible experience working with a Black midwife and people in the reproductive justice movement, I want to do anything and everything that I can to help build spaces where we are safe, where we are sharing information, sharing our stories, and where our families can be, you know, exposed to maternity care workers who will give us what we need.  A part of your ESSENCE essay that I enjoyed was how you spoke to the importance of demystifying the mystery of what’s happening in our community regarding the maternal mortality rates. I think this festival will help bring more bonding opportunities for black women and mothers and the needed visibility of what’s happening in our community.  Yes, absolutely. We want to show that it’s happening in silence and that the world is listening, watching, and seeing how we will fix this. Also, there are real, tangible ways to make things better for all of us to end maternity care deserts in our country and be able to report disrespect and abuses in our hospitals. The Momnibus bill hasn’t been passed in its entirety yet, and if we all come together as Black women and decide that this bill will be passed completely, it will. We deserve to be joyful and have the biggest, brightest hopes and dreams for our children and our own birth experiences. You know, not only is a baby born on that day, a mother is born too. We need our power to go into this world and be moms; nobody can take that power away from us.  The theme of the expo, “Birth to the Future,” focuses on imagination, hope, and possibilities for reproductive justice and birth equity; how can we, as Black women, begin to hope for a better tomorrow when it comes to birth equity amid glaring death statistics?  A huge part of it is this Momnibus bill. This legislation was created with Black birth workers and advocates at the table with the Black Maternal Health Caucus. The bill addresses environmental concerns, continual coverage, Medicaid coverage through pregnancy, birth, and the postpartum period, and lactation consulting. Being able to imagine a future while also saying, “What do you imagine for yourself? What do you want your birth experience to be like? Where do you want to do it? Do you want a birth center? Do you want a hospital? Do you want to be at home?” Having a midwife for a long time was really for middle class white women, but we have all these options too, so how do we make them available? There’s so much work being done. And it’s right there. We’re right there at the precipice of changing it.  As you know, midwifery isn’t new in our Black community, but unfortunately, at times, it’s now considered taboo or not the preferred choice of care. We’re seeing the effects of the maternal mortality crisis on Black women and mothers; how important is it that we go back to our roots?  Let me tell you something. I worked with an incredible Black midwife for the birth of my second son. I did not have one need that was not unmet. There was no choice that I was not given. And I was given those choices by my midwife. She asked every time she touched and measured my belly. My autonomy was completely respected. She got to know my family; she knew my oldest son. It’s an incredible experience to be cared for by somebody who looks at you and sees themselves, to be loved on, to be touched with loving hands. It is it’s the way it’s supposed to be.  Knowing our history is important too. And there’s a reason that some of us have funny feelings about Black midwives, Black doulas, or Black women caring for us. There are historical reasons that they’re not the first person that comes to mind. Black women caregivers were licensed out, sometimes even criminalized for doing the work they had done for centuries. There’s a reason we have those feelings. But it’s time to rethink all of that.  How do you think Black mothers can reclaim their joy at this point?  There are so many microaggressions that we, as Black women, have become very adept at navigating, in many areas of our life, right? In the workplace, going to the grocery store, taking our kids to school, and dealing with the teachers and principals. We push through, but this is one place where I don’t think we can do that. We reclaim our joy by reclaiming our power. It’s your body. This is your baby. You are the mother. Nobody cares more about the health and safety, and well-being of our babies than the mother, so you reclaim your joy by realizing that you have the power. It’s yours.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzc2VuY2UuY29tL2hlYWx0aC1hbmQtd2VsbG5lc3MvbWFtYS1nbG93LWRvdWxhLWV4cG8tdGF0eWFuYS1hbGkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

A collection of the latest news, views and analysis from the farming desk on the topic of Dairy.  Ireland is one of the leading manufacturers of infant formula. Three of the world’s largest producers, Danone, Abbott, and Wyeth, have manufacturing plants here.  Minister of State Neale Richmond, replying to Cork North-West Fianna Fáil TD Aindrias Moynihan, said his officials had informed him that China reported in January that its population had fallen for the first time in 60 years.  China’s strict one-child policy, which was implemented from 1980 to 2015 to respond to high levels of population growth, had been indicated as a reason for the decline.  Minister Richmond said the fall in the birth rate, whilst significant, is only one factor impacting the supply of international infant formula brands into China.  The others include the introduction of complex national operating standards coupled with intense competition from domestic Chinese infant formula manufacturers.  These have regained consumers’ trust and have significantly inhibited international companies to service the market. These brands have rapidly gained market share in recent years.  “This compares to a substantial fall in market share for imported brands such as Danone, Nestle, and Abbott,” he said.  Minister Richmond said 2022 Bord Bia analysis concluded that a strong market for premium-grade infant formula remains in China for Irish suppliers, both as an ingredient as well as finished product.  “However, manufacturers will need more in-depth customer engagement with stronger scientific proof points to serve a changing and more informed customer segment,” he said.  Algerian agreement  Tipperary Independent TD Michael Lowry also recently asked Agriculture Minister Charlie McConalogue in the Dáil to outline engagements he or his officials have had with the relevant Algerian ministry regarding plans for an agreement between the countries for dairy and infant formula.  The Minister said Ireland already has an existing sanitary agreement for dairy and related products with Algeria.  Representations were made to Algeria by the Department in relation to market access. There has been ongoing communication with Infant formula companies.  The Department sought clarifications in an official letter to the Algerian Government on February 1 relating to market access requirements. To date, there has been no response to these queries.

As astrologer and author of Rise and Shine: An Astrological Guide to How You Should Up in the World, Christopher Renstrom, tells mindbodygreen, you can consider it the ""spouse house,"" but also the house that rules business partnerships and even open enemies.  This house is on the opposite side of your chart as your ascendent (AKA rising sign) which kicks off your first house. ""The 7th house is as far away from the ascendant as it can be, so it was known as the descendant,"" Renstrom says.  Further, according to the AstroTwins, the 7th house is ""where we team up with others and get to know ourselves through our interactions and creating mutual give-and-take."" As they previously wrote for mindbodygreen, creating a balance of two forces is the goal of this house.  And is marriage not the ultimate way to combine and balance two forces? As Renstrom explains, marrying for love wasn't even a concept until more recent, modern times. In the past, marriage was a contractual agreement that united two families.  ""Marriages before our times were often arranged, and astrology has been around 2500 years—so the 7th house described who you were marrying because with marriage you sign a contract,"" he says, adding, ""You're legally bound to one another—as opposed to a fifth house, which is love affairs and romance.""  Then, suppose you get a divorce, that too is a theme of the 7th house, because not only do you have divorce papers to sign, but your ex then becomes your public enemy. Where the 12th house deals with secret enemies, Renstrom notes, the 7th deals with your enemies in plain sight.  But more often that not, he adds, whenever you see planets in the seventh house, ""chances are that's describing your partner and not describing you.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbmRib2R5Z3JlZW4uY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzd0aC1ob3VzZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

She’s a helper.  “A birth doula is a birth coach, a support partner and a bridge of communication between the coach and the provider.” Pye said.  Pye said a doula has a different role than a midwife.  “Doulas are working much more hands on,” she said. “We’re there longer, we don’t catch babies unless we have to. We’re focused on the physical and emotional support of the mother. We really get to know the mother. Midwives try but often they don’t have as much time as a doula. A doula is just there for the mom. A midwife is for the mom and baby, it’s more of the medical side. I offer emotional and physical support from a less medical point.”  Pye, who’s recently moved to the area, has four children of her own. During the pregnancy and birth with her third, she had a doula, too.  “That’s what did it for me,” she said. “It was great to have someone support me, help me post partum. It was also great support for my husband. It was a new hospital, she helped make sure things went according to my birth plan.”  Pye trained under Sabbath Schrader and other members of the Sacred Doulas group. Like other professionals, Pye continues to learn and expand her knowledge and experience.  “I continue to learn from the amazing birth workers I’m privileged to work alongside of,” she said.  She said health care providers are happy to have a doula working with their patients.  “Lots of providers love doulas,” she said. “They’re happy to see us there. They’ve learned we’re cooperative, it’s beneficial to both sides.”  She said having a doula help an expecting mother can offer them several important benefits. She said the need for C Sections is reduced, ACOG scores are better, there’s less need for pain medication and the informed consent is much more “informed.”  “All in all,” she said. “Mom and baby have better outcomes.”  Besides working on building her new client base in Fort Dodge with several local health providers, she’s also an herbalist. She said she hopes to be able to open a clinic for that sometime in the next year.  Herbal medicine is also something she uses in her role as a doula.  “Herbs can be surprisingly helpful in every stage of pregnancy including post-partum,” she said.  Pye can be contacted through her Facebook page “Hannah Pye Herbalist and Doula” or via email at hannahpyesapothecary@gmail.com  “The consultation is free,” she said. “I encourage everyone to ask lots of questions.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lc3Nlbmdlcm5ld3MubmV0L25ld3MvbG9jYWwtYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMy8wNS9ob3ctZG8teW91LWRvdWxhL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The 32 year old star, who is expecting a baby with her boyfriend Nat Eddleston, is gearing up to go into labour any day now.  Ellie, who always telly-watches with her sister Izzi on the Channel 4 show, has regularly been sharing pregnancy tidbits during her appearances.  The TV personality even revealed the exciting news she was pregnant during the series, as well as the gender too.  Yet during the latest instalment, she seemed to be having a bit of a nightmare in between shows as she obsessed over whether she had enough bibs off-camera.  (Image: CHANNEL 4)  ""That is all the bibs that I've got, how many bibs have I got? 12,"" the star panicked. ""Do I need more bibs?""  ""Ellie,"" Izzi then warned. ""This is a day's worth of bibs, so times this by seven what's 12 times seven?""  ""84,"" the mum-to-be answered promptly, as mum-of-two Izzi was trying to teach her sister a lesson.  ""Well 84 bibs then that's how many bibs you need,"" the star explained. ""Bibs bibs bibs bibs bibs, however many bibs you think you need it's always more. Always more bibs.""  (Image: Instagram)  (Image: CHANNEL 4)  It comes as fans were convinced for a while that Ellie had already given birth in secret.  The star had last posted on her Instagram page on April 10, as she posed with her friend Abbie at her baby shower.  With a blooming baby bump, the star beamed as she showed off her pregnancy to fans and even revealed the little tot was kicking, but she went completely silent for nearly a month afterwards.  As Ellie's followers became convinced she had gone into labour, the star suddenly returned with fresh snaps of her new pram, a turquoise traditional Silver Cross vehicle that sparkled with silver handles.  (Image: Ellie Warner / Instagram)  (Image: INSTAGRAM/ELLIE WARNER)  While the extravagant luxury pram retails new for £3,000, the star may have picked hers up second-hand.  For one thing, the bright colourway is now out of stock online, and the wheels already looked used and showed small signs of wear and tear.  In a sweet nod to her pet dog Mick, Ellie snapped her little pooch perched inside it.  ""Little monkey testing out the pram!

The Strictly Come Dancing star made the comments when he surprised his fiancee during her last show on Hits Radio as she goes off on maternity leave.  Gemma, who announced she was pregnant back in January and confirmed that their baby boy was due this summer, spent her last early evening on the airwaves with co-host Mike Toolan and producer Matt on Thursday (May 18) until next year.  Bury-born Gemma has recently been counting down to her maternity leave with Gorka, 32, set to join her at their Greater Manchester home for some precious time before their baby boy arrives. He is also finishing up on the Strictly Professionals UK tour which is currently in full swing up and down the country.

But to mark her last show, Gorka joined Gemma and Mike over the phone with mum-of-two-to-be Gemma writing on Instagram: ""And he knows I hate surprises,"" as she reshared a video from the Hits Radio Instagram account.  In the clip, Mike was heard quizzing Gorka about Gemma's plans for a water birth and the former Emmerdale and Hollyoaks star has previously shared how Spanish-born Gorka was taken aback when he was asked during an appointment with their midwife about his 'role' in the birth and whether he'd like to 'catch' their son when he is born.  ""I'm very excited, I'm just not looking forward to the birth day,"" Gorka confessed when asked how he was feeling about welcoming his second child into the world by Mike during Thursday's drivetime show on Hits Radio. He then explained: ""Because I'll probably have to be by her side so I will probably lose a hand and she will tell me the 'F word' a few times.""  (Image: Gorka Marquez/Instagram)  He then added: ""In the baby's bag there is obviously going to be the nappies, the clothes and everything then a helmet for me because I know she'll throw me a punch at some point.""  Mike then moved on to ask more about the birth as he said: """"We know it's going to be a water birth, are you prepared for this?"" to which the dancer replied: ""Yeah I've got my goggles, my Speedos. Obviously I'm going to be wearing Speedos."" And as Mike joked: ""He's diving in,"" Gemma quipped: ""Not again, that's how I got in this mess.""  But he ended on a sweet message for his future wife and her co-star, saying: ""I just want to say, obviously it's the last show of Gemma and I love to hear you both. Have a good last show.""

"birth","2019-03-14","Not Discerned","{""WestDesMoines"", ""Iowa"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T16:16:00","A vaccine given to mothers during pregnancy to protect babies from severe complications of RSV, a common respiratory virus and leading cause of infant hospitalizations in the United States, could be on the market soon. On Thursday, an advisory committee for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) voted in support of recommending the approval of Pfizer’s maternal RSV vaccine. The expert panel of 14 advisers voted unanimously on the experimental vaccine’s effectiveness, but some (10-4) voiced concerns about its safety based on the available data.  If approved by the FDA, the Pfizer vaccine would be given to pregnant individuals late in pregnancy to trigger an immune response in infants from birth through their first six months of life against RSV. The virus can be especially dangerous for premature infants and babies younger than 6 months old, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  Experts on the committee found the single-dose vaccine’s effectiveness promising. Trial data shows the vaccine, branded as Abrysvo, is 82% effective at protecting newborns from severe RSV infections during their first three months of life and is 69% effective at six months, according to a briefing document published by the FDA.  So while there was no debate about the vaccine’s effectiveness, some experts on the panel were concerned that the rate of preterm births among those who had taken the vaccine (5.7%) was slightly higher than those who got the placebo (4.7%). The FDA analysis of the data notes that while “a numerical imbalance” was observed, it does not appear to be “statistically significant.”  An ICU nurse caring for a young patient suffering from RSV. picture alliance/picture alliance/Getty Images  Dr. Paul Offit of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, one of the four experts on the panel who voted “no” on whether the vaccine was safe, told the Associated Press he was concerned about the risk of preterm births. “If you’re in any sense risking premature births with this vaccine, I think there will be a big price to pay,” Offit said.  Dr. David Kim, director of the Division of Vaccines at the Office of Infectious Disease in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and a member of the advisory committee, voted “yes” on both the vaccine’s efficacy and safety. He told CNN he wasn’t convinced that the data showed the vaccine caused preterm births. “I guess when I put all the evidence together, I’m not convinced that there’s a clear causal relationship between this vaccine and preterm birth. I don’t think we can rule out chance. I don’t think we can rule out confounding by time or place,” Kim told the news outlet.  Another panelist, Dr. Arnold Monto, told CBS News, he wasn’t sure more testing would give a clearer answer. “I’m troubled, as everybody is, by the prematurity issue,” Monto said. “And I’m not sure running it through another, maybe season, is going to give us an answer.”  As for mothers who received the vaccine during the trial, the FDA’s briefing notes they experienced mild to moderate adverse reactions such as fatigue, muscle aches, headache, and pain at the injection site.  Pfizer estimates that 20,000 infant hospitalizations and 320,000 doctor visits in the United States could be prevented every year if enough pregnant individuals received the vaccination. The FDA is expected to make a decision on the vaccine’s approval by August.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvbXBlci5jb20vbGlmZS9tYXRlcm5hbC1yc3YtdmFjY2luZS1pbmZhbnRzLWZkYS1jb21taXR0ZWUtYXBwcm92YWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Other stand-out suggestions:  “Having a baby really makes you rethink gifts you give new parents. I now always send a box of individually wrapped snacks bc someone sent that to me and it was my favorite gift because I always had a snack ready at the couch.”  “Someone on TikTok said their mother in law gifted them with 3 months of having a housekeeper come twice a week (she asked if they would like that as a gift first). That would have been my dream gift to receive during the first few months of baby.”  “When I had my first baby, a seasoned mom gave me a little basket with a cute water bottle, nipple cream, a universal tv remote, nursing pads, and a timer in it. It was a breastfeeding basket to keep with you so you have what you need and, honestly, BEST GIFT EVER.""  “First time my friend had a baby, I forgot to get a present and took the banana loaf I’d made that morning instead. Hands down still the best received gift ever; he told me after I left they ate half of it immediately, then the rest for dinner. Didn’t get it until I had my own.”  “Freezer meals and laundry service (especially for a c-section mom because you can’t lift anything.)”  “I made my best friend a lasagna every month, cut and wrapped in individual pieces so she could pop them in the microwave. Saved her so much time and hassle.”  “In my younger days, I showed up at a friend’s house who’d just given birth. She was totally overwhelmed. I told her to go get some sleep, and I would take care of her baby. She’s never forgotten.”  The expert says...  Etiquette author Lizzie Post tells TODAY.com to steer clear of high maintenance gifts, such as plants ... or siamese kittens. “Thoughtless gifts,” such as the three decorative pumpkins, are also a no-no, according to Post, who co-wrote ""Emily Post’s Etiquette, The Centennial Edition.""  “You also don’t want to go too personal with your gift if you don’t know the person very well. If their baby isn’t latching, and you send lactation cookies, that could cause them to break down,” Post explains.  Post says to consider the person you’re buying the gift for. Who was she before she became a mom?  “Your knowledge of who she is, will likely guide you to a gift that she’ll appreciate,” Post says.

What did Malcolm X fight for?  A2. Malcolm X fought for racial equality, social justice, and the rights of African Americans. He emerged as a prominent voice in the American civil rights movement.  Malcolm X , originally known as Malcolm Little, is a symbol of unwavering determination in the fight for civil rights. His impassioned quest for racial equality and transformative impact continue to resonate with movements across the globe. Recognized later as El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz, he rose to prominence during the American civil rights movement. Hailing from Omaha, Nebraska, Malcolm endured numerous hardships and witnessed the brutality of racism firsthand.Tragically, his father, a Baptist preacher and advocate for Black nationalist leader Marcus Garvey, was allegedly murdered by white supremacists. Furthermore, his mother's mental health struggles necessitated the placement of Malcolm and his siblings in foster care. These early experiences profoundly shaped Malcolm's worldview, illuminating the systemic injustices of society. As a teenager, he relocated to Boston and later settled in Harlem, New York City, where he became involved in criminal activities.Malcolm X underwent a transformational experience while serving a ten-year jail term starting in 1946. Within those gates, he accepted the Nation of Islam's (NOI) beliefs and converted to Islam. He also chose the surname ""X"" to represent the loss of African identity brought on by the horrors of slavery. After being freed, he rose to prominence as the NOI's leading spokesman, promoting racial secession and self-defense. But a transformative journey to Mecca in 1964 changed his outlook, inspiring him to embrace racial peace and inclusion.Malcolm X's murder brought a devastating end to a life spent battling the existing quo and defending the rights of African Americans.

Approximately 6,20,000 soldiers succumbed during this war, and efforts to honour them began soon after their demise. However, the origins of the holiday are steeped in debate and controversy. Historically, several towns have laid claim to being the birthplace of Memorial Day. Memorial Day, originating from the Civil War, pays tribute to fallen soldiers.(Photo by Justin Casey on Unsplash)  The Overlooked Narrative: African Americans' Contribution  Another narrative, often overshadowed, suggests that the tradition was birthed by African Americans in Charleston, South Carolina a year earlier in 1865. David Blight, Pulitzer Prize-winning historian and author of ""Race and Reunion: The Civil War in American Memory,"" recounts a commemoration that occurred on 1 May 1865, in Charleston, organised by freed slaves and white missionaries. This gathering was held at a former racecourse where Confederate captors held Union soldiers during the last year of the war. At least 257 prisoners had died there, many from disease, and were interred in unmarked graves. In the run-up to the event, approximately two dozen African American residents of Charleston rearranged the graves into rows and constructed a three-metre-tall white fence around them, thereby creating a memorial christened 'Martyrs of the Race Course'.  'The First Memorial Day Celebration'  The event attracted an estimated 10,000 people, primarily black residents, who partook in a tribute encompassing parades, songs, sermons, and speeches by Union officers, missionaries, and black ministers. The gravesites transformed into a 'sea of flowers,' and the New York Tribune depicted the tribute as 'a procession of friends and mourners such as South Carolina and the United States had never witnessed before'.  'Suppression of the African American Origin Story'  Despite these documented events, the narrative of African Americans founding Memorial Day largely remained untold, with David Blight asserting that this origin story was not the version many white individuals preferred to convey.  General John A. Logan and the Widespread Acceptance of Memorial Day  The origin story that gained widespread acceptance involves General John A. Logan, president of a Union Army veterans group, who in 1868 encouraged Americans to adorn the graves of the fallen with flowers on May 30. The ceremony that took place in Arlington National Cemetery on that day is frequently regarded as the first official Memorial Day celebration. Memorial Day was declared a national holiday in 1889 and was later shifted in 1968 to the last Monday of May, where it is still observed today  SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhpbmR1c3RhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS93b3JsZC1uZXdzL21lbW9yaWFsLWRheS0yOXRoLW1heS10aGUtcm9sZS1vZi1hZnJpY2FuLWFtZXJpY2Fucy1pbi1vcmlnaW4tMTAxNjg0NDkzNTA4OTg0Lmh0bWzSAYABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaGluZHVzdGFudGltZXMuY29tL3dvcmxkLW5ld3MvbWVtb3JpYWwtZGF5LTI5dGgtbWF5LXRoZS1yb2xlLW9mLWFmcmljYW4tYW1lcmljYW5zLWluLW9yaWdpbi0xMDE2ODQ0OTM1MDg5ODQtYW1wLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Colostrum, the first form of breastmilk, is nutrient-dense and high in antibodies and antioxidants to build a newborn baby’s immune system. It changes to breast milk within two to four days after the baby is born. Colostrum is thicker and more yellow than traditional breast milk.  In this small village, surrounded by rice fields and populated with many cows and goats, access to information about maternal and infant care was limited.  “I didn’t know about health check-ups for pregnant women,” says Priyanka, 25, mother of Pollobi, 2. “Many women died during their pregnancy or while giving birth. This was normal and a risk we all took. The women gave birth at their homes, now most of us go to the community clinic.”  Progress, but not enough of it  According to a study by the World Health Organization, Bangladesh has made progress in bringing down maternal mortality, from 441 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2000 to 123 deaths in 2020 — a rate that is still very high. The Sustainable Development Goal Target 3.1 stipulates reducing the maternal mortality rate to less than 70 deaths per 100,000 live births by 2030.  Most of the complications from which women die are preventable.  Access to maternal care and skilled birth attendants is believed to be of utmost importance in reducing maternal mortality — yet almost half of all births in Bangladesh still take place at home without the help of skilled birth attendants. The WHO study shows that only 30 percent of mothers who have had no previous education in comparison to 63 percent of mothers with secondary education had access to a skilled birth attendant. In addition, depending on how poor a woman is, the less likely she will have a skilled health professional at her side when she is giving birth. Only 32 percent of the poorest mothers in comparison to 86 percent of the richest have access to skilled delivery support.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYXJlLm9yZy9uZXdzLWFuZC1zdG9yaWVzL25ld3MvYmFuZ2xhZGVzaC10aGUtcG9vcmVyLXRoZS1tb3RoZXItdGhlLWxlc3MtbGlrZWx5LXNoZS1oYXMtYWNjZXNzLXRvLXNraWxsZWQtZGVsaXZlcnktc3VwcG9ydC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(KLKN) — Yet another amendment has been proposed for Nebraska’s highly divisive bill that bans abortions at 12 weeks, while prohibiting transgender care for minors.  A final vote on the recently combined Let Them Grow Act and Preborn Child Protection Act is scheduled to happen this Friday.  Senator Lynne Walz of Fremont filed the amendment that lists three key changes.  First, it would allow abortions 12 weeks after fertilization. The bill currently bans them 12 weeks after a woman’s last period.  Walz’s amendment also adds exceptions for pregnancies involving fetal anomalies that would result in the death of a fetus within three months.  The final change specifies rules and regulations minors must meet before receiving gender-affirming care, excluding genital surgeries which would still be banned.

"birth","2023-05-15","Not Discerned","{""Carson"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T19:08:21","Born legally blind, Aaron Ross began working toward a degree at Western Nevada College more than a decade ago.  With assistance of WNC’s Disability Support Services office, Ross’ dream of graduating with an Associate of Arts degree will come true Monday during WNC’s Commencement Ceremony at Marv Teixeira Pavilion.  “It will mean the greatest achievement in my life,” the Carson City resident said. “I’ll talk about it for years to come. I’ll have my cap and gown that I can show off to everybody.”  Ross was born with retinopathy of prematurity, a disease causing detachment of the retinae. Doctors tried to reattach them, but the surgery was unsuccessful, leaving Ross blind.  Fortunately, there has been plenty of support from Aaron’s parents, Rick and Jacqi. By the time he entered the first grade, Ross also received the support of Carol Ewing, also blind, who helped him become familiar with Braille. Ross went on to graduate from Douglas High School.  Susan Trist started working at WNC at nearly the same time that Ross enrolled. The program director for Disability Support Services has been instrumental in Ross’ progress.  “One of the greatest challenges for our department was the timely delivery of accessible materials for Aaron,” Trist said. “As soon as he would register for the next semester, we would be in contact with his instructor to determine what textbooks would be used for that particular course. Braille conversion is a time-consuming process — the sooner we deliver materials to the vendor, the better, to allow them time to convert the content and ensure timely delivery of materials.”  DSS also provided textbooks and materials in audio and course materials in electronic Word/PDF documents.  Ross has preferred classes in person “because of the benefits of verbal interactions with instructors and classmates,” according to Trist. He also used a tape recorder to record lectures and his Pac Mate device to record information. Trist said Ross has a screen-reading program called JAWS on his home computer to provide text-to-speech access. He can also convert text to speech on his iPhone.  There are times, however, when Ross needs more assistance.  “For his science courses, we provided a classroom aide to verbally describe content that was presented visually,” Trist said. “For example, in Dr. Winnie Kortemeier’s Geology and Geography classes, the aide would describe maps, charts, colors, rocks, minerals, or graphs, etc. Hope Braille, a full-service braille production company in Reno, would create content from the textbooks — maps, charts, and pictures labeled with Braille — so that he could ‘see’ (feel) the images.”  DSS staff met his Uber rides or bus driver in the parking lot to help him make it to class safely. Staff members have also delivered his accessible textbooks to his apartment and workplace.  DSS’s devotion — in particular Trist’s — to his higher education goal isn’t lost on Ross.  “She’s meant a lot to me,” he said. “She’s provided me with everything I’ve needed to complete my classes. If I could recommend her to anyone with a disability, I’d recommend her in a heartbeat. Whatever needs to be done, she can get it done.”  Ross’ commitment to his employer — Western Nevada Supply — has limited his semester course load to one or two classes. He works six hours a day answering phones.  “I’ve made friends and developed lifelong friendships over the years,” Ross said about his 16-year employment at Western Nevada Supply.  Ross’ next goal is becoming a paraprofessional (teacher’s aide).  “You can’t put words to it,” said his father, Rick, who Ross has entrusted to guide him across the commencement stage. “My wife will be crying and so will I. Whatever he has done over past years while working is nothing short of incredible. What he does in a day to get by and improve himself, I can’t do in a month. He’s a pretty special person, and we’re lucky to be his parents.”  To learn more about Disability and Support Services, contact Trist at 775-445-4459 or susan.trist@wnc.edu.

"birth","2023-07-16","Not Discerned","{""Candor"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T22:29:00","The producer of 2022's excellent ""We're All Going to the World's Fair"" crafts a similar movie whose themes you feel in your gut before anywhere else.  TEXAS, USA — So much attention is paid to the prodigy-level directorial debut – the “Aftersuns,” “Return to Seouls” and “We’re All Going to the World’s Fairs” of the world – that we run the risk of overlooking introductory efforts heralding names to pay close attention to even if they don’t kick off their filmographies with a masterwork.  Such is the case with Theodore Schaefer and “Giving Birth to a Butterfly,” a 77-minute fable as strangely tender as its title suggests, even if the ultimate catharsis isn’t as finely shaped as the immense sadness that defines the journey there. Strolling along on the sliding scale of strangeness somewhere between Yorgos Lanthimos and Josephine Decker, Schaefer has made a surreal movie about suburban malaise that might have been probing for some meaning itself if it didn’t deploy the self-awareness that some of its more hopeless characters couldn’t dream of wielding.  Case in point: Paul Sparks’s dolt of a dad Daryl, who proclaims “Even better!” after his son introduces his pregnant girlfriend Marlene (Gus Birney) to the family and clarifies the baby isn’t his. Daryl is too preoccupied with aspirations of opening a fast-food joint that he can’t bother to think things through without speaking, but his case of disillusionment is hardly the most acute in a neighborhood where metaphorical cages range from the entrepreneurial and domestic to the artistic and just plain obtuse. Only Daryl’s wife Diana (Annie Parisse) emerges as a figure aware of the waking-nightmare reality that defines the proceedings, at least initially—and Parisse’s performance is beautifully calibrated to a character who can’t decide if she wants out or simply wants to get by.  At first blush, “Giving Birth to a Butterfly” faces a similar struggle. Without much of a jumping-off point to speak of, we must quickly adjust to a place and time where an inability to discern what anyone wants in the face of what they have creates a sense of uneasiness (and, in at least one scene, skin-crawling tension). Is this an experiment in mood first and foremost, or are we expected to be moved when Marlene returns home to find her own mother lost beyond recognition to showmanship dreams that will never pass?  Suffice to say, that parental alienation draws Marlene closer to Diana. When the latter finds out her identity has been stolen, the two eventually take their common ground on the road—and on the path to more assured filmmaking from Schaefer. If the grade-A weirdness of the movie’s first half keeps a kaleidoscopic exploration of maternal figures simmering under the surface, potent injections of pathos helps the second bloom into a clearer – albeit no less oddball – vision about confessions and reckonings.  Schaefer has a compelling visual sensibility, too, that helps buttress against flatter moments when characters talk about “Simpsons” characters and mythic Greek heroes in the same sentence, a scene that feigns for cosmic profundity but stumbles in execution. A square-Polaroid aspect ratio emphasizes the cages our characters are trapped in while Matt Clegg’s grainy cinematography further drives home that they’re running out of time faster than they realize. Most striking is the movie’s catalog of images shot through or against reflective surfaces, a motif perhaps speaking to the idea that everyone in “Giving Birth to a Butterfly” could stand to examine themselves a little bit closer.  The final stretch of “Giving Birth to a Butterfly” sees planes of reality fully breaking down, revealing the movie at both its most immediately captivating, its most narratively obscure and its most emotionally meaty; it ultimately comes to make total sense that Schaefer served as a producer on Jane Schoenbrun’s “We’re All Going to the World’s Fair,” a similarly alluring work whose meaning reveals itself deep in your gut before anywhere else. If “Giving Birth to a Butterfly” finds Schaefer in his own storytelling metamorphosis, it’s worth awaiting what he has to offer once fully emerged.  ""Giving Birth to a Butterfly"" is not rated. It's now streaming on Fandor. Runtime: 1 hour, 17 minutes.

When Mannhardt hit the road Monday, his trek was suddenly stopped. He saw a pregnant deer and one of its babies dead on the side of the road.  ""I knew something got hit. And I thought it was something big,"" said Mannhardt. ""As I drove by, I looked over and I had seen some movement.""  Mannhardt couldn't believe what happened next. As he approached, the mother deer laid there lifeless. Then, there was a sign of life. She was pregnant.  ""A little head was poking out of the rest of it in a hole in a sac. And it was trying to get out and trying to get out and it just wouldn't get free,"" Mannhardt said.  Without thinking, he ripped open the amniotic sac the baby deer was still in.  ""So I pulled it free and checked its legs and nothing was broken. It seemed to be fine,"" said Mannhardt.  He loaded the little fawn into his truck and wrapped her tightly with his fleece jacket to keep her warm and to ensure she didn't move. He carried on to Kincardine and called around to see where he could bring the tiny deer, all while dealing with the emotion.  Jurgen loaded the little fawn into his truck and wrapped her tightly with his fleece jacket to keep her warm. (Submitted/Jurgen Mannhardt)  ""I mean, at the roadside, I was fighting tears because of the mother and the other baby. That really hit me hard,"" Mannhardt said.  He got a hold of Hobbitstee Wildlife Refuge, who told him they could pick the fawn up that day at the Guelph Humane Society. So he went back in the car and drove two hours the opposite way.  Jordyn Moorehead is the wildlife care attendant who was on-shift at the humane society when the fawn was brought in.  ""I was worried, of course, because of the trauma the mom and the other baby had sustained. I was kind of concerned the state the fawn was going to be in,"" Moorehead said.  But to her surprise, the fawn was faring well, especially with the odds stacked against her.  ""That's the first time I've ever heard something like this happening,"" said Moorehead.

Participant  : The midwifery students participated in the study for three years (the fourth, fifth, and sixth academic semesters). The inclusion criteria of participants included a willingness to participate in the study and not passing the previous courses on vaginal birth. The participants had working experiences related to childbirth. Students with recognizable diseases affecting their learning ability (such as hand-eye coordination problems (Dyspraxia) and feeling extreme stress, or having accidents during the training and evaluation sessions were excluded from the study. Having identified the eligible students, all participants who studied in the investigated school entered the study. The participants were randomly divided into two groups: intervention and control. The students were assigned to the intervention and group based on systemic randomization. In order to do this, we calculated and fixed the sampling interval. After that, we selected a random starting point and repeated the sampling interval to select subsequent elements.  Instructor and evaluators  A trained instructor (MSc in midwifery) with ten years of working experience in midwifery facilitated the students’ learning process in the intervention and control groups. They are faculty members at the Shoushtar Faculty of Medical Sciences.  Two evaluators with an MSc in midwifery with ten years of working experience evaluated the student’s performance in both groups. They were female, and the mean age of the instructor and evaluators in this study was 38 years. They all had a valid midwifery certificate from an Iranian medical science university from the first-class Ministry of health in Iran.  Educational intervention  The participants in the intervention group attended simulation-based training before formal clinical education. All students were female.  The main objective of the training for the intervention group was to help perform an uncomplicated cephalic birth. The educational content of the workshop is shown in Table 1. The students in the intervention group participated in a three-day workshop to exercise the process of cephalic birth on a pelvic and vaginal birth moulage made by M and Nasco companies. On the first day of the workshop, the instructor explained the workshop’s objectives, the course’s educational content, and the sessions’ schedule to the students. Then, in one hour, she gave explanations in the form of lectures, slide shows, and videos about the vaginal examination, pelvic examination, and how to give birth with a cephalic presentation, and then, she practically showed them how to give birth on the moulage to the students.  Afterward, each student was asked to practice normal vaginal delivery on the moulage. The skills were individually taught, and the students repeated these independently. The formative assessment of the students was conducted by evaluating the student’s performance of simulated births (at least 3) under the instructor’s supervision. The instructor provided constructive feedback. In the next sessions, the instructor addressed the practical training of the students. In each meeting, enough time was allocated to answer the questions and solve the students’ skill problems.  Subsequently, the students experienced formal clinical education in the hospital’s maternity unit that used lectures and practical work in the clinical field. Practical activities of the students in the clinical field included clinical history taking, checking vital signs, Leopold’s maneuver, fetal heart rate checking, vaginal examination, taking IV line, sending the necessary tests, checking the course of birth, drawing a partograph, and giving birth under the supervision of the instructor. In this step, the students exercise the process of cephalic birth in supervising the instructors. The students could involve in the process of cephalic birth independently. Each student in the clinical field must independently control at least three pregnant women from labor entry to birth and submit a performance report to the instructor. (A formative assessment in the real situation). During their training, the students were given constructive feedback in the formative assessment process.  Table 1 The educational content of the workshop Full size table  Control Group  In the control group, the students participated in formal clinical education that used lectures and practical work in the clinical field. They have no simulation-based training before the formal courses. The practical actions of the students in the control groups were similar to the intervention group. Likewise, the intervention group, each student must independently control at least three pregnant women from labor entry to birth in the clinical field and submit a performance report to the instructor. During their training, the instructors delivered constructive feedback in the formative assessment process in the clinical field (A formative assessment in a real situation).  Summative assessment process  The clinical skill of normal vaginal birth among the students in the intervention and control group was assessed by observational examination in a real situation. Two trained evaluators assessed the students using a checklist in the labor room. The evaluators were educated on the observational examination principles, the checklist items, and scoring in a 2-hour session. Additionally, the evaluators were asked to practice the evaluation process of students from labor entry to delivery in a simulated situation.  The blinded evaluators were assigned to the groups to assess the students during their clinical placement when caring for real women during labor and birth. The evaluators assessed the student’s skills in the process of a real-life patient birth in a labor situation.  To investigate the long-term effects of the training course, we evaluated the same students over three years (the fourth, fifth, and sixth academic semesters).  Measures  The students’ clinical skills were assessed by an 8-question checklist based on a Likert scale (unacceptable, very poor, poor, average, good, and excellent). The range of scores of this checklist was between 8 and 48 points, and higher scores indicated higher levels of students’ skills in childbirth. The content validity of the checklist was approved by ten midwifery faculty members. This checklist was finalized after going through two stages by applying experts’ opinions. The pilot test was done for ten students to assess the reliability of the checklist items using internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.822). A related checklist examined skills such as head control, rotation, umbilical cord checking, head removal, body removal, grasping the baby, and skin-to-skin contact.  Data analysis  The Shapiro-Wilks test was used to check the normality of data distribution. Since the data were normally distributed, we used the independent t-test to compare the two study groups, the ANOVA test, and the Generalized Estimating Equations model to compare the students’ performance in the three semesters. Data analysis was done using SPSS version 21 software. The significance level of the above tests was considered P-value < 0.05.  Ethical consideration  The current study was approved by the ethics committee at the Shoushtar Faculty of Medical Sciences (IR.SHOUSHTAR.REC.1397.007) in the southwest of Iran (Shoushtar). The study’s objectives were explained to all students, and it was emphasized that participation was completely voluntary and did not interfere with the subsequent educational program or with final grades. All students completed the written informed consent to participate in the study.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vYm1jbWVkZWR1Yy5iaW9tZWRjZW50cmFsLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy8xMC4xMTg2L3MxMjkwOS0wMjMtMDQzMTktOdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"birth","2023-05-01","Not Discerned","{""Haines"", ""Alaska"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T22:22:49","A moose calf and cow (From Lisa Hupp/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Alaska Region)  Mother’s Day falls in May, but it’s also when moose cows are giving birth — and experts say we should watch out.  Carl Koch is a wildlife biologist with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. He warns that the animals can be particularly touchy when they have newly born calves.  “When they first give birth, the calf has to build muscle until it can grow strong enough to run from danger,” Koch said. “The most common thing they’ll do is bed down when they are in trouble — mom knows they can’t run away, so she’ll get very defensive.”  Koch says the cow’s most common defense is to stomp on whatever is threatening her calf. A moose can kick in any direction with its front hooves.  Koch says that cows frequently leave their calves alone for a day, knowing they will not be able to go far. Sometimes people will find a calf in this situation and assume it is orphaned.  “Interfering in that can make matters worse,” he said.  Koch remembers one occasion a few years ago in Haines, when people crowded around a calf. He says this probably prevented the mother from reuniting with her newborn.  “They may just abandon the calf — they often have twins, so they might just cut their losses if one of them is in a spot where they are having trouble getting back to it because people aren’t leaving it alone,” Koch said. “When folks call and say there is a calf in their backyard and they are worried about it, I say ‘Leave it alone,’ and if they have pets I say, ‘Please keep the dogs out of the backyard.’ Some folks want to keep checking on it every hour; we prefer they just leave it alone.”  Koch says almost every time, within a day and a half they will have moved on. About half of the moose charges Koch hears about typically occur at this time of year. He recently received a report of one person with a loose dog being charged by a cow in Gustavus.  Cows will generally give birth to their first calf two or three years after their own birth. They will get pregnant in September during the breeding and hunting season, and give birth in mid-May. That makes their pregnancy about the same length as a human mother’s, but they do it almost every year.  In an area with plentiful food, like the Chilkat Valley near Haines, Koch estimates that up to 90% of females of breeding age will give birth in any one year. With the valley’s population of roughly 350 moose, Koch guesses about 100 calves could be born this spring.  The calves will weigh the same as a mid-size dog. They will get milk from their mother but can also eat leafy plants, like willow and dogwood, just after birth. As they age, they progressively shift to an all-plant diet. Koch says around one in three calves will survive the summer.  Adult females can reach over 1,000 pounds, and live up to 17 years in the wild.  For anyone running into one of the irritable new mothers, Koch has one piece of advice.  “If a moose is charging you, do the opposite of what you do with a bear: run and get behind something big,” he said.  Koch says every year in Alaska, some people are injured by moose. He asks that any dangerous interaction with a moose be reported to the state’s Department of Fish and Game, or the Alaska Wildlife Troopers.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vYWxhc2thcHVibGljLm9yZy8yMDIzLzA1LzE5L2dpdmUtYmlydGhpbmctbW9vc2UtYS13aWRlLWJlcnRoLWJpb2xvZ2lzdC1zYXlzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Despite having had many traumatic experiences in hospitals throughout her life, Nas felt calm and in control during the birth of her child. She wanted one familiar person to care for her and advocate for her, rather than seeing different midwives or doctors at every appointment, which can be time-consuming and trigger old trauma for people with disabilities.  Nas was a public patient in a high-risk midwifery program, and her midwife, Cherie Desreaux, had never cared for a mum with disability before. Together, they worked on Nas’s birthing plan and came up with their own strategies for support, as there were very few resources available for parents with disability. Cherie formulated an individualised care plan for Nas that included face-to-face sessions with lactation consultants and hands-on training to learn how to bathe, change, and dress the baby safely.  However, when Nas’s 36-week scan showed abnormal function with her placenta, the plan needed to change. Nas was nervous about having a C-section, but the anaesthetist and her team made her feel calm by introducing themselves and asking what she needed to feel more comfortable. It was the first time medical professionals had considered what Nas needed to feel supported during a procedure, and she felt seen, heard, and respected.  Nas’s experience highlights the limited maternity support available for mothers with disabilities. While there are good midwives and services across the country, generally the system isn’t set up for parents with disability. Laura Seymour, program coordinator and midwife at Melbourne’s Royal Women’s Hospital, suggests several improvements to the system, including prioritising women with disability for midwifery programs where they are seen by the same person, providing access to disability-specific clinics with wrap-around services, and creating written resources that maternity staff can draw on.  Nas and Cherie reflect on their experiences and acknowledge the challenges of finding resources specific to Nas’s needs and the use of language. Cherie realised how often her words didn’t fit Nas’s needs and changed the way she described things to her. As a maternity service, there is still much to do to build on resources for pregnant women with disability, and building relationships and networks with disability organisations for support and guidance is paramount.  Nas’s birthing experience was what she describes as the gold standard, where individual needs are considered and accounted for. However, it was also based on luck, as Nas was lucky to strike a team willing to support her in the way she and her baby deserved. Every mother with disability across Australia should be able to expect the same.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbHZpbGxhZ2VzcGFjZS5jb20vYXVzdHJhbGlhL2Mtc2VjdGlvbi1lbXBvd2VyZWQtbWUtZmVlbGluZy1yZXNwZWN0ZWQtYW5kLWluLWNvbnRyb2wtZHVyaW5nLWJpcnRoL9IBcmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbHZpbGxhZ2VzcGFjZS5jb20vYXVzdHJhbGlhL2Mtc2VjdGlvbi1lbXBvd2VyZWQtbWUtZmVlbGluZy1yZXNwZWN0ZWQtYW5kLWluLWNvbnRyb2wtZHVyaW5nLWJpcnRoLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Hospitals that put into place programs to feed infants in neonatal intensive care units (NICU) exclusively human milk diets saw fewer cases of NEC among premature infants, avoiding serious and often life-threatning injuries, as well as reducing treatment costs according to findings published this month in the medical journal BMC Pediatrics.  Researchers from children’s hospitals nationwide say human milk-based fortifiers have been available since at least 2006, making exclusive human milk diets (EHMDs) possible for newborns, even when their mother cannot breast feed. However, despite repeated evidence of benefits over cow’s milk-based formula, the programs have not been widely adopted.  The findings are the latest in a number of studies over the years that suggest human milk, even if it has to come from donors and not the birth mother, is a better option than infant formula products for the growth and development of a child.  Infant Formula Concerns  A number of prominent health organizations have raised concerns about the aggressive marketing of Similac, Enfamil and other formula products over the past decade, which promoted the cow’s milk-based formula as an equally effective alternative to a mother’s breast milk.  False and misleading statements have been blamed for driving many families away from breastfeeding, and suppressed demand for human donor milk, while also increasing the incidence of NEC from infant formula.  These allegations have been raised in a number of Similac lawsuits and Enfamil lawsuits being pursued by families of premature babies who developed a severe and life-threatening affliction, known as necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC).  Families allege that the formula manufacturers knew that products like Similac and Enfamil cause NEC at substantially higher rates than is seen among premature babies fed breast milk or donor milk alone, yet the products were actively promoted use of among newborns still in the NICU. The manufacturers even introduced specific formulations of Similac and Enfamil for use among premature babies, which has been blamed for causing many cases of avoidable NEC injuries.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFib3V0bGF3c3VpdHMuY29tL2h1bWFuLW1pbGstZm9ydGlmaWVyLW5lYy1zdHVkeS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Despite the advantages associated with childbirth registration, a 2018 Zambia Demographic Health Survey indicates that birth registration levels in Zambia are low due to poor attitudes towards childbirth registration, financial challenges, and an inadequate workforce at registration centres, among other reasons. The survey found that only 14.2% of children under five years have registered births, with 6.6% having birth certificates. These low rates of child registration and birth certificates infringe on their fundamental human rights, which are supposed to be facilitated by parents.  With financial support from United States Agency for International Development (USAID), CIDRZ’s Empowered Children and Adolescents (ECAP) III project has been supporting program beneficiaries to promote access to birth certification of children regardless of their status. This has been done in collaboration with the Department of National Registration, Passport and Citizenship office.  A 42-year-old mother, and beneficiary of the programme, Mwaka Tembo (Not her real name), shared how long she attempted to apply for birth certificates but to no avail. She also narrated how in the process, caregivers lost documents, which she described as a serious concern.  “I was enrolled in 2021 on the ECAP III project in Chilanga District under the people living with HIV sub-population. My Household was screened and assessed; four of my children and my husband were eligible for support.” Said Ms Mwaka  An ECAP III vulnerability assessment also found that the family’s children lacked birth certificates, among other things. This prompted the ECAP Team to support this mother with the birth registration process. Ms Mwaka’s case is just but one of the many parents who have benefited from the ECAP III project and who have since had their children’s birth certificates issued.  “We are grateful as a family to be part of this project and to benefit from it in the way we have. Things have never been the same since we started receiving support from the ECAP III project. I am happy that my children now have legal identities and birth certificates,” Ms Mwaka happily re-counted.  The ECAP III project has continued working with different sectors of the Zambian government and other national, provincial, district and community stakeholders to improve the social and health outcomes of vulnerable households in high-HIV burden districts of Lusaka and Eastern provinces.  These interventions are aimed at mitigating the impact of HIV and improving the health and well-being of vulnerable children and adolescents, especially those living with or at high risk of HIV.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVpbm5ld3MuY29tL3ByX25ld3MvNjM0Nzg4MDc4L3VzYWlkLWVjYXAtaWlpLXByb2dyYW0tYm9vc3RzLWJpcnRoLXJlZ2lzdHJhdGlvbi11cHRha2XSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

A Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) team has found a new gene “set” that helps predict risk for several neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism, ADHD, Tourette syndrome, and depression.  The team’s findings were published this week in Nature Neuroscience. The lead author is Dylan E. Hughes, of MGH’s Department of Psychiatry.  “That genetic risk factors for mental illness in kids begin to influence the brain so early on—even before birth—means that interventions that protect them from risk may also need to start earlier in life than previously expected,” said co–senior author Joshua Roffman, MD, director of MGH’s Early Brain Development Initiative, in a press release. “It is also important to note that while genes play an important part in risk for mental illness, the early life environment is also critical—and at this point, potentially easier to modify.”  The MGH team used data from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. This study of child and adolescent brain development has enrolled nearly 12,000 individuals at age 9–10 years. The MGH team set out to see whether genes associated with psychiatric illnesses in adults are similar to those associated with psychiatric symptoms in children.  “We found those relationships to be more complex than we had imagined. For example, genetic risk for ADHD and depression were associated with a range of symptoms in children, not just those related to attention or mood,” said Roffman. “The genetic factors that shape mental illness symptoms in kids differ from the ones that shape mental illness symptoms in adults.”  Notably, the strongest genetic predictor for most mental health symptoms in ABCD participants was a new measure, a “neurodevelopmental gene set,” developed by the paper’s co–senior author, and computational geneticist, Phil H. Lee, PhD, and colleagues at the Mass General Center for Genomic Medicine. This gene set points to heightened risk for several common neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism, ADHD, Tourette syndrome, and depression.  With their international collaborators, the MGH team determined this gene set also predicted childhood psychiatric symptoms in participants of the Netherlands’ Generation R study.  Studies of samples from brain banks also showed that the genes in this set are expressed mostly in the cerebellum, and their expression peaks before birth. Also, brain imaging data from the ABCD study indicated that children with psychiatric symptoms tended to have a slightly smaller cerebellum.  These finding all suggests that very early intervention is warranted.  The MGH team is investigating other factors during pregnancy—such as quality sleep, exercise, diet, optimal prenatal care, or psychosocial support—that may protect against risk of psychiatric disorders in children. Currently, a study called Brain health Begins Before Birth (B4) is enrolling families at MGH during pregnancy and then following children’s brain development after birth.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbnNpZGVwcmVjaXNpb25tZWRpY2luZS5jb20vdG9waWNzL3BhdGllbnQtY2FyZS9uZXVyb2xvZ2ljYWwtZGlzb3JkZXJzL2dlbmVzLWV4cHJlc3NlZC1iZWZvcmUtYmlydGgtaW1wYWN0LWxhdGVyLW1lbnRhbC1pbGxuZXNzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(WMC) - The Memphis Zoo announced the births of two Sumatran tiger cubs Friday.  The cubs were born on the evening of May 5 to mother Dari.  Sumatran tigers are one of the more critically endangered subspecies of tigers.  These are the first tiger cubs born at the Memphis Zoo since 1998.  “As the last of the island tigers, preserving Sumatran tigers is critically important,” West Zone Curator Dan Dembiec said. “Sumatran tigers are managed collaboratively in breeding programs by accredited zoos globally. So, the birth of tiger cubs here at the Memphis Zoo is a milestone with a worldwide impact.”  The cubs are not yet on exhibit. Once the cubs are six weeks old, they will receive a series of vaccinations before they will be able to explore their outdoor exhibit at about three months of age.

In body cam footage from the day the newborn was discovered, first responders can be seen comforting and checking her vitals, eventually swaddling her in a blanket.  Freeman said evidence from the scene and the investigation suggests that Jiwani likely delivered the baby in a vehicle and “drove alone for a significant amount of time” before leaving the child in a remote wooded area.  “Evidence also reveals a history of hidden and concealed pregnancies and surprise births in Ms. Jiwani’s history,” he said. “Additional evidence indicates that she had known of this particular pregnancy for a period of time, a fairly considerable period of time, and went to extremes to conceal this pregnancy.”  Freeman said during the investigation it was discovered that Jiwani had other children living with her, which “ranged from school-age to near-adult.”  “There are additional children,” he said. “We have contacted our partners with the Department of Family and Children Services and asked them to evaluate and put a safety plan in place.”  Throughout the meeting, Freeman referred to Jiwani as the child’s “birthing parent,” later adding he had “trouble with the word mother” to describe her.  Freeman said at the press conference he could not discuss Jiwani’s motivation for leaving the child or details of her interview with the sheriff’s office after her arrest as the case is pending prosecution but added, “little can explain how this happened and no motive can justify the decision.”  In the years since the infant was discovered, Freeman said the investigation took thousands of work hours, spanned across the country and “utilized every significant technological and investigative technique we could find” before hitting a major break in the case nearly a year ago.  “Now, approximately 10 months ago, with advanced DNA investigative practices, familial DNA, the sheriff’s office was able to identify the father of Baby India,” Freeman said. “That began an even more concerted investigation, with a focus to determine the manner, cause and who was responsible for leaving Baby India to die in an isolated area of the woods.”  Partnering with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and the FBI’s Atlanta office, Freeman said finding the child’s biological father – adding there is “no evidence at this point that the father was aware of either the pregnancy or the abandonment of Baby India” – narrowed down the search to find the child’s birth mother, who was identified by DNA evidence about a week before the arrest.  “How a parent, and I happen to be one too, can do such a callous thing is both incomprehensible to all of us, and it’s infuriating,” Freeman said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JzeXRobmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9jcmltZS1jb3VydHMvYnJlYWtpbmctYmlydGgtbW90aGVyLWFycmVzdGVkLW1vcmUtZGV0YWlscy1naXZlbi1pbi1iYWJ5LWluZGlhLWFiYW5kb25lZC1pbmZhbnQtY2FzZS1pbi1mb3JzeXRoLWNvdW50eS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"birth","2022-04-09","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T06:45:00","The widow of a young man from West London who tragically died from a brain tumour has given birth to their second child, 16 months after his death. Jasdip Sumal was left heartbroken when her husband Aman was diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour, but decided to fulfil their dream of having another child.  Aman was diagnosed in August 2020 after suffering a seizure and headaches, with doctors initially believing he had a low-grade tumour. He was given anti-seizure medication and referred for three-monthly scans, however after suffering another seizure five months later, an MRI showed areas of concern.  He underwent debulking surgery, with Covid-19 restrictions preventing anyone from being by his side. A biopsy of Aman’s tumour revealed it was a grade 4 glioblastoma (GBM), which has a devastatingly short prognosis of just 12 to 18 months.  READ MORE: Devastated best friends pay tribute to East London pal who kept terminal cancer secret for months so he didn't worry them  (Image: Brain Tumour Research))  He underwent chemotherapy and intensive radiotherapy while his family privately funded a protocol with an Australian naturopath and turned to crowdfunding to help with his treatment.  Sadly, his health continued to deteriorate and he died in December 2021 aged just 36, leaving behind his wife and much-adored two year old son, Rajan. Following his death, Jasdip, who lives in Ruislip, decided to welcome a second child and gave birth to their daughter, Amandeep, a week before what would have been Aman’s 36th birthday.  The 38-year-old, who is working with the charity Brain Tumour Research to share her story, said: “We had our son through IVF in 2019 and we always planned to have another child, but then Aman got sick and everything after that was a whirlwind so we never got the chance.  “I thought about doing it while he was still here. I knew he didn’t have long and thought it would be a nice thing to tell him if he could understand me, but he passed away in December 2021 and after that I was coping with the grief of losing him. I still wanted to have a family though, and knew there would never be a good time. It was always the plan to have a sibling for Rajan, and that was important to Aman too, so I decided to go ahead with it.  “Aman’s strength is what showed me I could do it. He was so strong during what was an incredibly hard time and I knew nothing I did would be harder than that.”  (Image: Brain Tumour Research)  She added: “Aman was over-the-moon with Rajan but always said ‘I have one of me and it would be nice to have one of you too’. I know he would have been all over our daughter. It’s just such a shame he won’t ever get to meet her.  “It’s bittersweet, which is what I think everyone struggles with, but hopefully she’ll bring acceptance that Aman’s gone and that the next chapter for all of us is the kids.”  Jasdip fell pregnant in August 2022 and, after a pregnancy that consisted of “moments that should have been happy but also brought sadness”, on April 9 she gave birth to a healthy baby girl whom she named Amandeep.  She said: “I have a big family and had so much support throughout. I couldn’t have done it without them. My sisters-in-law came to my appointments with me and were my labouring partners, so I didn’t have the worry of being alone. Aman was obviously very missed, but having the girls with me was the next best thing, and for that I am truly grateful. One of them even cut Amandeep’s umbilical cord, which was lovely.”  She added: “I always knew I was going to name her Aman because in our religion it’s a name for both sexes, but in the end I decided to combine parts of both our names. I’ve spelt mine differently but the pronunciation is the same.  “I know Aman won’t be forgotten but doing this gives us another memory of him. Amandeep’s never going to get to meet him, which is really sad, but if she holds his name, that’s something she has of him.  “Our son will have photos of the two of them together but the name is something she can have that’s only hers, and hopefully she’ll appreciate that when she’s older. Hopefully both our kids will grow up feeling like they know him.”  Jasdip and Aman’s family have continued to support Brain Tumour Research and are raising awareness for the charity. Jasdip said: “It’s very close to our hearts now. We want to do all we can to help others in Aman’s honour – it’s what he would have wanted and is all we can do now to keep him alive.”  Charlie Allsebrook, community development manager for Brain Tumour Research, said: “We were over-the-moon to learn about the birth of Amandeep, which has come as such a blessing for her family. Her mum, Jasdip, has shown incredible strength since Aman’s passing and is much admired by the team at Brain Tumour Research. We’re grateful for her continued support of the work we do and wish her and her children good health and happiness for the future.  “Aman’s sad story is a stark reminder that brain tumours kill more children and adults under the age of 40 than any other cancer, yet just 1 per cent of the national spend on cancer research has been allocated to this devastating disease. We’re determined to change this but it’s only by working together we will be able to improve treatment options for patients and, ultimately, find a cure.”  Don't miss out on the biggest local stories.

(Image credit: Red Wolf Recovery Program)  An extremely rare litter of critically endangered red wolf pups has been born in the wild for the second time in five years. The wolf parents have also adopted a captive-bred pup into the new brood for the first time, further raising hopes that the species can be saved from extinction.  The litter consists of three females and two males and was born in early April in Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge in North Carolina, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Red Wolf Recovery Program (RWRP). The RWRP announced the news May 10 on Facebook , along with images of the adorable pups.  The mother, known as 2225, and father, known as 2323, had another litter of five in 2022, which were the first documented wild births since 2017. The pups from the 2022 litter have remained with their parents and are expected to help rear their baby siblings, according to RWRP representatives.  Due to the parents' success at raising their first litter — and the added support their first litter will provide — conservationsits were confident that a sixth pup could be introduced into the pack. A few weeks after the litter was born, a male pup, which was born at the Point Defiance Zoo and Aquarium in Washington state, was introduced to the litter and adopted by the parents. This brings the pack to 13 individuals, making it the largest known red wolf group in the wild.  Related: Twin polar bear sisters reunited years after mother rejected one of them  The adopted sixth member of the litter, photographed before he was introduced to his new family. (Image credit: Red Wolf Recovery Program)  The new litter is ""a cause for joy and celebration,"" RWRP representatives wrote on Facebook. ""Every generation yields a newborn hope for [the] recovery of the red wolf.""  Red wolves (Canis rufus) are currently listed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species . There are only between 20 and 30 individuals in the wild, not counting the new pups. The red wolf population lives exclusively in North Carolina, but the canines once roamed the southeast and south-central U.S. in great numbers before being driven to the brink of extinction by hunting, habitat destruction and hybridization with coyotes, according to the Center for Biological Diversity .  There are also around 270 captive red wolves in zoos across North America, according to The Wildlife Society . Continuing to introduce captive wolves into the wild, either by releasing adults or fostering pups into wild packs, will be necessary to increase genetic diversity in the wild and prevent inbreeding, which can lead to genetic conditions that impact survival.  In the future, cloning could also potentially be used to help increase the population of red wolves. In September 2022, scientists in China announced that, for the first time, they had successfully cloned an Arctic wolf pup (Canis lupus arctos), which was born to a surrogate beagle mother . But there are no current cloning projects for red wolves.  Red wolves are not the only U.S. species struggling to survive in a rapidly changing world. In February, NatureServe, a conservation group focused on biodiversity in North America, released a report that revealed up to 40% of animal species and 34% of plant species are at risk of going extinct in the country.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVzY2llbmNlLmNvbS9hbmltYWxzL2xhbmQtbWFtbWFscy9iaXJ0aC1vZi13aWxkLXJlZC13b2xmLXB1cHMtYnJpbmdzLWhvcGUtdG8tc3BlY2llcy1vbi1icmluay1vZi1leHRpbmN0aW9u0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Back to Healio  Key takeaways :  Odds of preterm birth increased in Native American/Alaska Native population in recent years.  Causes of increased preterm birth in this population are not fully understood and warrant further investigation.  BALTIMORE — The odds of preterm birth in the American Indian/Alaska Native population in the central New York region rose significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers reported at the ACOG Annual Clinical & Scientific Meeting.  A team of researchers at State University of New York (SUNY) Upstate Medical University in Syracuse conducted a study to evaluate changes in preterm birth before and after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic among the American Indian/Alaska Native population in central New York compared with other race and ethnicity groups.  Source: Adobe Stock.  “There is a fair amount of research showing that American Indian/Alaska Native populations have an increased risk for preterm birth compared with non-Hispanic white populations,” Nicholas Baranco, MD, a third-year maternal/fetal medicine fellow at SUNY Upstate Medical University, told Healio. “However, there’s not a lot of literature regarding Native American/Alaska Native populations in general. The population in the central New York region is relatively small; it’s about 1.5% of our total population of births.”  The researchers identified 178,420 singleton births in this region from 2012 to 2022 using the New York State Perinatal Data System; 21.4% of births occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. They then compared the rate of preterm birth among patients who self-identified as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic Black, American Indian/Alaska Native or other before March 2020 and from March 2020 to June 2022.  “We saw a fairly large increase in the odds of preterm, early preterm and very early preterm birth in our local Native American/Alaska Native population, while we didn’t see similar increases in other race and ethnicity groups,” Baranco told Healio.  According to the results, the odds of preterm birth before 37 weeks’ gestation increased in each race and ethnicity group over time:  American Indian/Alaska Native: 9.8% before March 2020 to 13.4% after March 2020 (OR = 1.42);  non-Hispanic Black: 11.8% to 13% (OR = 1.12);  non-Hispanic white: 8.2% to 9% (OR = 1.11); and  other: 9.1% to 10.2% (OR = 1.13).  The odds of early preterm birth before 34 weeks’ gestation and very preterm birth before 28 weeks increased only in the American Indian/Alaska Native population during the study period, from 2.8% to 4.8% (OR = 1.71) and from 0.5% to 1.7% (OR = 3.34), respectively.  The findings remained significant after adjustment for risk factors that changed during the COVID-19 pandemic, including prepregnancy BMI, diabetes, maternal age and smoking, according to the researchers.  “We did not expect to find any statistically significant difference, especially at the very early preterm birth level,” Baranco told Healio in a discussion of the results.  The researchers concluded that the causes of increased preterm birth in the American Indian/Alaska Native population are not fully understood and warrant further investigation. Baranco said follow-up will continue.  “Physicians should definitely have an awareness that Native American/Alaska Native populations have a higher risk of adverse health outcomes, including premature birth. This is a highly varied community that is difficult to study because of the relatively low numbers and diverse life experiences in different geographic regions; even within one area of one U.S. state, the experience in one tribal nation can be very different than in another,” Baranco told Healio. “Direct engagement with patients in these communities is likely going to be the best way to figure out what that community specifically needs.”  Reference:","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oZWFsaW8uY29tL25ld3Mvd29tZW5zLWhlYWx0aC1vYi1neW4vMjAyMzA1MTkvb2Rkcy1vZi1wcmV0ZXJtLWJpcnRoLWluLWFtZXJpY2FuLWluZGlhbmFsYXNrYS1uYXRpdmUtcG9wdWxhdGlvbi1yb3NlLWR1cmluZy1wYW5kZW1pY9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"birth","2023-05-10","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T13:00:00","Being able to buy birth control pills off the shelf took a big step forward on May 10. Two advisory committees to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration voted unanimously to make a birth control pill available without a prescription.  The pill, called Opill and known by the generic name norgestrel, is a progestin-only pill. That’s in contrast to combined oral contraceptive pills, which contain progestin—or another form of progesterone — along with a form of estrogen (SN: 4/13/23). Progesterone and estrogen are two of the hormones that regulate the menstrual cycle.  Opill gained FDA approval for prescription use in the United States in 1973, under a different brand name. The advisory committees that recently met were tasked with considering a switch from prescription to over-the-counter status, which involves reviewing data that the drug can be used safely and effectively without the oversight of a physician.  The FDA committees — one with expertise on non-prescription drugs, the other with obstetric and gynecological drugs — endorsed the switch, and they are not alone. Medical organizations including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Family Physicians are also in favor of an over-the-counter birth control pill. The FDA is expected to announce a decision on the recommendation this summer.  If Opill gets the over-the-counter nod, it would become the most effective birth control method on store shelves, surpassing existing options like condoms and sponges. It would also remove barriers that can make getting this birth control option challenging for many people.  The possibility that a birth control pill could become more easily available comes as the United States faces a maternal mortality crisis, abortion bans and possible restrictions on an FDA-approved abortion medication (SN: 3/16/23; SN: 6/24/22; SN: 5/18/23). Science News talked with two sexual and reproductive health equity researchers about the impact of over-the-counter access to the pill on reproductive health and autonomy. The interviews were edited for length and clarity.  SN: What barriers do adults and adolescents face in terms of access to different birth control methods?  Rachel Logan, University of California, San Francisco: I think it’s the same barriers for both groups, although I think adolescents face more. It is transportation to health care appointments. [There are] barriers within care, such as some providers requiring a pelvic examination or a full gynecological exam before providing or prescribing contraceptive methods. [It is] a lack of insurance coverage. Unfortunately in this country, because we don’t have federally mandated, comprehensive sex ed, some people just may not know about all of the contraceptive methods that exist.  There continues to be the stigma associated with needing contraception and who uses contraception that is very patriarchal and really demeaning to people, like it says something about you if you have to use these methods, as opposed to [contraception being] an essential tool in your reproductive health journey. Another area that I don’t think is talked enough about is contraceptive coercion — that could be from a parent, a partner or a health care provider — where your options to use the method of your choice are limited for whatever reason.  SN: What could it mean for adults and adolescents to have over-the-counter access to hormonal birth control, especially considering the maternal mortality crisis and abortion bans?  Anu Manchikanti Gómez of the University of California, Berkeley: Providing people the opportunity to be unpregnant is always important, but more important than ever because of these additional crises. Abortion bans have many effects, obviously, on people’s ability to access abortion. But [bans are also] having a chilling effect on health care providers in some states. Maybe they are leaving those states where abortion is banned, or not coming [to those states] in the first place. Those are generally the same providers who might be doing contraceptive counseling or providing pap smears or prenatal care, [so] there can be less access to this care. Birth control can’t solve those issues, but there may be ways that more access is going to be particularly helpful when access is being lost in other ways.  Logan: It feels like we’re in a very critical moment where reproductive autonomy is definitely under threat. So this could mean extending options to people who otherwise may not have an option or a way to obtain a method of birth control that works for them. Being able to walk into a store and pick something off of the shelf that you can use and is very safe and effective is life changing.  SN: What do we know about the historical impact of prescription birth control?  Gómez: The availability of hormonal birth control has been transformative for, historically, cis gender women’s participation in the world, in the workforce, in their ability to engage in education. Being able to control your fertility is such an important part about being able to control your destiny. There are many things that can affect our ability to live the lives that we want, but if you are a person who can become pregnant, [it’s] really important to have the option of deciding if, when and how you want to become pregnant or remain pregnant.  SN: When choosing a birth control method, what does it mean to take a person-centered contraceptive care approach?  Gómez: A person-centered approach, if we’re talking about contraceptive access, means … actually support[ing] the person in making the decision that’s best for them versus what someone else thinks they should be doing. There’s a long history of birth control abuse and coercion in the United States, from forced sterilization to aggressive promotion of certain methods toward Black communities and people who are poor. Even though there are different levels of effectiveness of different types of methods, that doesn’t make one more medically appropriate.  For some people, they don’t like something that they can’t stop using without going to see a health care provider [such as an implant or other long-acting reversible contraception]. You may feel that you’re losing bodily autonomy through using a method that you can’t stop using on your own. That’s a very real concern for some people, and it’s definitely grounded in some of the historical abuses and racism and ongoing experiences of low-quality care that some people, too many people, experience.  Logan: [A person-centered approach] is being OK with people saying, “no, I don’t want to use that method,” and saying, “that’s fine,” as opposed to [providers] feeling like it’s their job to convince people to get on a method or to use a particular method. [It’s] showing people that you care about them using what feels right and best for them. We’re aligning people’s preferences with methods that are available.  SN: Does the possible over-the-counter availability of hormonal birth control assist with this approach?  Logan: Yes. It gives people the power that they need without these constraints that are really only hurdles. This is in no way to replace routine preventative care. It is to reduce barriers to methods that we know are safe and effective that people can use independently. I think the health care system is already very strained. Is it a good thing that we’re moving some services that we know to be safe and effective outside of the health care system? I would say yes.  Gómez: [Easier access] can make a huge difference for people. Being able to start using [a birth control pill] without seeing a provider, that removes many layers of barriers. All of those can reduce people’s ability to use it at all or to use it continuously. Not everyone wants to use the pill, [but for those who do] having over-the-counter access is really going to help people.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VuZXdzLm9yZy9hcnRpY2xlL2NvdW50ZXItYmlydGgtY29udHJvbC1waWxsLXJlcHJvZHVjdGl2ZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"birth","2023-05-17","10:00:00","{""Dublin"", ""Dublin"", ""Ireland""}","2023-05-19T16:00:00","There’s a scene in season ten of Curb your Enthusiasm in which Larry David — the mansplainer’s mansplainer — runs into Randi, a friend of his ex-wife’s, at the gym. After some jousting about the statute of limitations for wishing someone Happy New Year — “It’s a little late, frankly, for the ‘Happy New Years,’” he grumbles — they make for the treadmills. Randi starts off at a steady trot, but Larry can’t focus on his run. Randi is eight months pregnant, and Larry’s transfixed by her belly as it swings from side to side. “Oh my God,” he says, “I pity that fetus.” “My body, my fetus,” Randi replies, as Larry storms off in disgust. The scene works because Larry’s concern doesn’t seem to be entirely misplaced. What kinds of experiences, one wonders, might Randi’s fetus be having?  I was struck by a similar question a few months before the birth of my son. My partner needed regular exercise. Walking aggravated her already sore hips, and so she took up swimming. It was mid-morning, and the pool was busy. A group of excited schoolchildren had congregated at one end; at the other, elderly ladies did steady lengths. As my partner swam toward me doing the backstroke (her belly looking for all the world like an over-stacked luggage trolley), I couldn’t help but wonder what kinds of experiences our soon-to-be-born son was having. Did he enjoy being rolled from side-to-side? Could he hear the chattering of the children? Was he aware of the beating of his heart — or indeed of his mother’s heart? What is it like to be suspended in 800 mL of amniotic fluid, surrounded not by a world of moving objects and hard surfaces but by the soft tissue of the womb? Indeed, is there anything that it’s like to be a fetus or a newborn infant? How might we tell? Can we tell?  When does consciousness begin?  There is little consensus about when consciousness might first emerge. Some endorse a late onset account, holding that consciousness isn’t in place until late infancy, or even toddlerhood. For example, the psychologists Joseph Perner and Zoltan Dienes have argued that consciousness is probably not in place before age 1, while the philosopher Peter Carruthers has defended an even more radical view, arguing that consciousness does not emerge until age 3.  Late onset views are typically motivated by the thought that consciousness requires heavy duty cognitive resources. On Carruthers’ account, the child must be able to grasp the distinction between how the world is and how it appears or seems in order to have any kind of awareness. The claim that consciousness requires significant cognitive capacities is controversial. Those who reject it typically endorse an “early onset” account of consciousness, according to which consciousness is in place by early infancy, if not prior to birth.  Those who spend extended periods of time caring for infants are, I suspect, likely to gravitate toward an “early onset” view of infant consciousness. That is certainly my own experience. My 5-month old daughter refused to sleep the other night. As I played peek-a-boo with her into the early hours of the morning, she chortled like a drunken sailor. Consciousness seemed to be evident in her laughter, and the question of whether she was genuinely conscious was no more deserving of serious consideration than the question of whether the barista who makes my morning coffee is genuinely conscious.  That said, intuition — what seems “obvious and undeniable” — may not be trustworthy. It may seem “obvious and undeniable” to someone interacting with ChatGPT that it is communicating with a conscious agent, but that assumption would be flawed. And even if our intuitions about 5-month-olds are trustworthy, intuition can hardly support a comprehensive account of the emergence of consciousness. Newborns tend not to strike us as “obvious and undeniable” candidates for consciousness in the way that older infants do, and we certainly don’t know what to say about fetuses without going beyond intuition.  Unfortunately, going beyond intuition is challenging. We cannot measure consciousness in the way in which we can measure temperature, pressure, and radiation. In the absence of a “consciousness meter,” we are forced to rely on inferences about infant consciousness based on the behavioral, cognitive, and neural correlates of consciousness in adults. Such inferences are unlikely to provide “proof,” but they might take claims about the emergence of consciousness beyond mere intuition and place them on a firmer footing, especially if multiple correlates of consciousness point to the same conclusion.  Brain networks  Research into the neural networks thought to underlie consciousness provides one correlate of consciousness. One of the most prominent of these networks is the default mode network (DMN). Studies have suggested that the recovery of consciousness following anesthesia and severe brain damage in adults is associated with the re-emergence of interaction between the DMN and other brain networks, in particular the dorsal attention network (DAN).  Using functional MRI data, a team at Trinity University Dublin led by Lorina Naci and Rhodri Cusack found that interaction between the DMN and the DAN can be seen at full-term birth. (Interestingly, this interaction was also observed in pre-term infants, but only once they had reached term-equivalent age.) It would be a mistake to take this finding as proving that (full-term) infants are conscious from birth, but it is certainly suggestive.  Data about the development of brain networks speaks most directly to questions about when the capacity for consciousness is acquired. However, even if infants have the capacity for consciousness from birth, they may not realize that capacity until much later. (Compare: My Subaru Forester has the capacity to reach 117 mph, but to the best of my knowledge, it has never realized that capacity.) Is there any evidence that the capacity for consciousness might be realized in early infancy?  Attention, integration, and oddballs  There is, although it too is suggestive rather than demonstrative. One line of evidence concerns the capacity of infants to segregate auditory input into distinct streams. Suppose that one hears someone speaking in the context of another sound, such as background music. In adults, sorting auditory input into two distinct streams (the spoken words versus the music) appears to require conscious attention. Thus, it is interesting to note that the capacity to segregate auditory input into distinct streams appears to be in place from birth.  A second clue to the emergence of consciousness involves the integration of sensory modalities. Although some forms of sensory integration can take place outside of consciousness, others — such as those involved in the McGurk effect — appear to presuppose consciousness. First described in 1976, the McGurk effect occurs when one watches a video in which the audio track of one phenome (for example, /ba/) has been dubbed onto images of someone mouthing a different phoneme (for instance, /ga/). Rather than consciously perceiving either /ba/ or /ga/, listeners are likely to perceive another phoneme altogether, such as /da/. Crucially, the McGurk effect appears to occur only when one is conscious of both the visual input (the mouthed phoneme) and the auditory input (the spoken phoneme); when that input is prevented from reaching consciousness, the effect disappears. Behavioral studies suggest that the McGurk effect can be found in 4-month-old infants. It is possible that comparable forms of intersensory integration might occur in even younger infants, although neural measures of integration would likely be needed to find them.  Perhaps the most intriguing evidence of consciousness in early infancy comes from a study conducted by Julia Moser at the University of Tübingen. Moser and her colleagues used second-order (“global”) auditory oddballs to probe for consciousness. Consider a sequence of tones that are clustered together into four groups of four tones, where each tone is either high pitched or low pitched. In the global oddball paradigm, the final tone in the first three groups differs from the preceding three tones (for example, if they are low then it will be high), but the final member of the last group will be identical to the preceding three tones (for example, they might all be low tones). In this scenario, the final tone is not an oddball (that is, outlier) relative to the preceding three tones, but it is an oddball relative to the entire sequence, for anyone who hears the three earlier groups of tones will expect the final member of this group to be an oddball.  Earlier research has suggested that the brain produces a distinctive response to second-order oddballs, which can be roughly thought of as a neural marker of surprise. Further, there is some evidence that this response is produced only when an individual is conscious. Using fetal magnetoencephalography (MEG), Moser and her team discovered that a version of this response could be found not only in newborns but also in 35-week-old fetuses. Again, this result does not provide proof of perceptual awareness in early infancy (let alone in utero), but it is yet another illustration of how neuroscience is beginning to pull back the curtain on infant experience.  Is it really human consciousness?  Whenever consciousness first emerges, it surely does so in a form that is radically unlike that with which you and I are most familiar. Experience in the infant is (one presumes) absorbed by its immediate objects — the movement of a branch, the sound of voices, the taste of breastmilk. Infants presumably lack the capacity to stand back from their own experiences — to make them objects of critical reflection. Nor, presumably, do they have any sense of themselves as a continuing subject of awareness or as members of a community of conscious agents.  We, of course, can subject our experiences to critical scrutiny; we can ask whether the world is as it appears to be. Our awareness is not limited to the contents of immediate perception, but includes both memory and imagination — an awareness of how things were or how they might yet be. And we are not solipsists, but conceive of ourselves as inhabiting a shared world of experience.  In many respects then, the most interesting question may not be when the developing human being first becomes conscious, but when those features that are distinctive of human consciousness first emerge. When do we first acquire the capacity to subject our experiences to critical scrutiny? When do we first acquire the capacity to recollect the past or imagine the future? In some important sense, it is only when we have figured out the answers to these questions that we will know when “human” consciousness first truly emerges.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vYmlndGhpbmsuY29tL3RoZS13ZWxsL2h1bWFuLWNvbnNjaW91c25lc3Mtd29tYi1hZnRlci1iaXJ0aC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"birth","2023-05-17","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T21:27:00","Pregnancy is contagious, I often say. That is, one thing that causes people to have babies or to have a lot of babies is other people around them having lots of babies. The reverse is true, too: One thing that causes people to not have babies or to have fewer babies is other people around them having few or no babies.  Obviously, pregnancy is not transmitted through aerosolized particles, but the childbearing behavior of others around you does affect your child-bearing behavior in a number of ways.  ESTABLISHMENT MEDIA PROMOTE RACISM WHILE TRYING TO RUIN PEOPLE'S LIVES  Sometimes it’s just what seems normal. In my very Irish-Catholic social circles, having five to 10 children is not weird, and so a couple with two kids doesn’t feel social pressure to stop, or doesn’t simply assume it’s time to stop.  But also, having children around makes parents more considerate of children’s needs and wants. In a town with lots of children, a parks department with some land to develop is more likely to think of a playground or a skate park than in a town with mostly retirees or single, college-educated, secular, professional 22-year-olds.  For this reason, as America’s birthrate falls well below two babies per woman — and most of that is due to more women having zero babies — the “germ” is less present in the population, and so we should assume birth rates will continue to fall.  To phrase it like a demographer, low and falling fertility is self-reinforcing — which is the opposite of what Thomas Malthus’ model dictates.  To phrase it more directly, let’s quote columnist Stephanie Murray: “America's fertility decline is about more than money. It's about a society that doesn't like kids.”  Murray aptly summed up the sense of elite America thus: “Children are a personal choice and therefore a personal problem, many people seem to believe. Have as many as you want — just make sure they don't bother the rest of us.”  But children cry, take up space, sometimes run around, and sometimes smell bad. A culture based on “personal space,” autonomy, and minding your own business is a culture that pretends children don’t exist. The more people who go through their daily lives not seeing kids, or seeing only very few, the easier it is to uphold this myth of a childless world — and then that childless world becomes reality.  See South Korea. Birthrates there are shockingly low (below 0.8 babies per woman of childbearing age), and that has led to a world in which adults simply aren’t used to seeing kids. In such a world, kids become less welcome.  The New York Times ran a piece earlier this week about how much of South Korea has been ruled “child-free.”  Government incentives for babies have failed to boost the birth rate anywhere near the replacement level. That’s because the government can’t change people’s family desires if the culture is anti-family.  “There are hundreds of no-kids zones throughout South Korea. The National Library of Korea, for example, prohibits anyone under the age of 16 from entering without special permission.”  Most of the population approves of these child-free places, the Times reports:  ""'I usually go to cafes to study. I don’t want to be interrupted by crying kids,' Lee Chan-hee, an engineering student in Seoul who frequents a cafe that prohibits children, said in an interview this week.""  Other reasons for supporting the zones include the prevention of accidents and property damage as well as injuries to young children. Protecting the rights of small business owners was also a consideration.  A great contrast is Israel, where children are accepted and even expected almost everywhere. At “beer and pizza” at 8 p.m. on a Wednesday night, you’ll see little kids. “The bus drivers have an affection for kids,” is how one former resident of Jerusalem put it.  CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER  Israel has one of the highest birth rates among wealthy countries.  A place that openly loves kids will have more kids, and a place with more kids will be more welcoming to kids. That’s a virtuous circle. South Korea — and most of Europe, along with the U.S. — is experiencing the opposite.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25leGFtaW5lci5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9raWQtZnJlZS16b25lcy1ob3ctbG93LWJpcnRoLXJhdGVzLWNhdXNlLWV2ZW4tbG93ZXItYmlydGgtcmF0ZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

And her mind is now on parenting.  The model and only child of first-time grandparents Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger posted a photo of her childbirth to Instagram on Friday where she is seen lying in a bathtub with wires streaming from her pregnant belly into a monitor. While managing to carry a small can of Sprite, Baldwin appears to be asleep as she leans her head against a rolled towel.  “The photo I’m going to show my daughter when she back talks,” Baldwin cheekily wrote in the caption.  Advertisement  The day before, Baldwin had announced her child’s birth with a separate photo of herself carrying her swaddled daughter alongside her boyfriend, RAC, a Portuguese musician and record producer whose real name is André Allen Anjos. “Holland,” she wrote with a pink heart emoji, confirming her daughter’s name.  Ireland’s stepmother, Hilaria Baldwin, who in September gave birth to her seventh child with Alec Baldwin, greeted the newborn with a photo of her and Alec with their children, and wrote, “All of these aunties and uncles and us grandparents are so excited that Holland is here!!! Congratulations to the mama and papa, Ireland and Andre. We love you so very much!”  “holland!!!!!!!” exclaimed Ireland’s cousin Hailey Bieber with a row of heart eye emojis beneath the original post. Ireland’s uncle, Billy Baldwin, added, “Welcome to the world Baby Girl Holland. We love you.”  Other high-profile figures joined the well wishes in the comment section, with Rumer Willis, who gave birth to her daughter last month, greeting Holland by writing, “Omg omg hi sweet girl—we can’t wait to squeeze you,” along with heart eye emojis. “OMG YAYYYYYY CONGRATSSSSS MAMA,” wrote singer Megan Trainor. And model Ashley Graham commented, “congrats mom & dad!!”  On Friday, Baldwin, 27, also shared a photo from her Instagram story of herself lying in bed with her eyes shut, and wrote, “Mother of 1 day old. Brain rot ... wearing adult diapers.”  After announcing her pregnancy in December, Baldwin shared a vulnerable message on social media about her difficulties with pregnancy during which she felt “unmotivated,” “exhausted” and “alone.”  “Pregnancy is hard. It takes so much out of you. I wasn’t ready for that,” she wrote, noting the toll on both “my mind and my body.”  “Being someone who deals with extreme health anxiety on a daily basis, pregnancy turned things into a high gear,” she said, possibly referring to her cardiophobia, which is an anxiety disorder that causes people physical sensations such as chest pains and heart palpitations, along with fears of having a heart attack and dying. “I’ve struggled to adapt to these changes. Bodily sensations. Pains and aches.”  She closed her statement by clarifying that “none of this reflects on how excited I am to be her mom” and added that “it’s okay to admit how hard and scary it can be.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhdGltZXMuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQtYXJ0cy9zdG9yeS8yMDIzLTA1LTE5L2lyZWxhbmQtYmFsZHdpbi1iYWJ5LWNoaWxkYmlydGgtaG9sbGFuZC1hbGVjLWJhbGR3aW7SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"birth","2023-10-01","Not Discerned","{""Poughkeepsie"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 19:27:46","By Dr. Forest Tennant, PNN Columnist  Persons with adhesive arachnoiditis (AA) and other severe painful conditions such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) have multiple tissues that become damaged, painful and dysfunctional.  Healing those damaged tissues and reversing the pain and neurologic impairments will require regenerative hormones. This is in contrast to other types of hormones that control inflammation (cortisone), metabolism (thyroid) or sexual functions (estradiol).  The human body makes some natural regenerative hormones, and they are now available for clinical use. Our first realization of their value in treating AA was with human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG). Other regenerative hormones that can be used to treat AA include colostrum, pregnenolone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), nandrolone, and human growth hormone (HGH). We have used all of these and believe that persons with AA should use at least one of them. But our first choice is colostrum.  Colostrum is in mother’s milk produced during the first few days after birth. It contains high levels of tissue growth factors, anti-inflammatories, pain relievers, and anti-infectious agents. Its natural purpose is to allow the newborn baby to initiate growth, protect against infection, and provide pain relief from the trauma of birth.  Colostrum supplements are sold by a number of companies and are usually made from the milk of cows that have recently given birth. Colostrum is recommended for use at least 3 to 5 days a week by persons with AA or EDS, who may wish to double the labeled recommended dosage. Colostrum is non-prescription, relatively inexpensive, and has few side effects. It can be taken with opioids and other drugs.  Regenerative hormones work best when they are used simultaneously with a high protein diet, collagen or amino acid supplements, vitamin C, B12, and polypeptides.  If a person with AA is not doing well or deteriorating, we recommend adding a second regenerative hormone such as nandrolone. A significant reversal of AA symptoms may require one or more regenerative hormones.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhaW5uZXdzbmV0d29yay5vcmcvc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLzUvMTgvY29sb3N0cnVtLWEtcmVnZW5lcmF0aXZlLWhvcm1vbmUtZm9yLWFyYWNobm9pZGl0aXPSAW9odHRwczovL3d3dy5wYWlubmV3c25ldHdvcmsub3JnL3N0b3JpZXMvMjAyMy81LzE4L2NvbG9zdHJ1bS1hLXJlZ2VuZXJhdGl2ZS1ob3Jtb25lLWZvci1hcmFjaG5vaWRpdGlzP2Zvcm1hdD1hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Bronx Defenders and Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer LLP filed two lawsuits Thursday against New York City's Administration for Children's Services, accusing the agency of discriminating against parents of color in its child removal decisions.One suit seeks information from the agency about a 2020 internal racial bias audit and the agency's response to it. And the other suit was filed on behalf of a Black mother who ACS separated from her newborn a few days after his birth based on a positive marijuana test at the hospital.Both suits are ""necessary because despite years of public reports, family testimony — and even ACS's own audits and public commitments to becoming an 'anti-racist' organization — the agency continues to separate families and criminalize parents based on race,"" Arnold & Porter, which is representing plaintiffs in both cases pro bono, said in a release Thursday.""We welcome this opportunity to partner with The Bronx Defenders on these critically important litigations,"" Arnold & Porter partner Michael Schissel said in a statement. ""It is time for the judicial process to address the devastating racial inequities that ACS has failed to remedy on its own, and to bring to light ACS records surrounding the 2020 racial equity audit that so decidedly exposed ACS's discriminatory practices.""Chanetto Rivers, a Bronx resident who gave birth in August 2021, said in Thursday's complaint filed in New York federal court that she was denied the opportunity to bond with her son in his first week of life because the hospital she gave birth in tested her and the baby for marijuana without her consent, and when the test came back positive, the hospital alerted ACS.The agency instructed the hospital to hold Rivers' baby indefinitely, even though he was medically cleared to go home, which was in violation of New York state law, the complaint claims. Cannabis legalization law the Marihuana Regulation and Taxation Act, or MRTA, which went into effect six months prior, prohibits child separations based on cannabis possession, the suit says. And even ACS' own 2019 guidance directed caseworkers not to remove a child or file a case against a parent for a positive marijuana test, it says.""Yet ACS was so focused on its desire to separate a Black mother from her child that it ignored its own internal policies and violated this important New York state law,"" the complaint says.Arnold & Porter said in Thursday's release that Rivers' suit is the first to be brought under MRTA. In addition to claiming that the city agency violated the law, Rivers alleges the actions were racially charged. Data shows that New York City is far more likely to separate Black children from their parents than white children. In 2021, 1,267 Black children entered foster care, making up 47.1% of all children entering the system, while only 126 white children entered the system, comprising 4.7% of the total, according to data from the NYC Workforce Institute.An ACS spokesperson told Law360 on Thursday that while the agency can't comment on specific cases, it would never separate a child based solely on marijuana use.""ACS is committed to keeping children safe, and, at the same time, addressing the systemic racial disparities that exist in child welfare-- New York City children and families deserve both,"" the agency said. ""ACS does not indicate a case nor remove children based solely on a parent or caregiver's use of marijuana. When ACS investigates a case involving an allegation of parental drug/alcohol misuse (regardless of what the substance is), ACS's policy and practice mandated under law is to assess the impact any misuse has or may imminently have on child safety.""Arnold & Porter also helped bring a case on behalf of The Bronx Defenders, asking a New York state trial court to require ACS to release information for which The Bronx Defenders had already filed a Freedom of Information Law request in December 2021.According to the complaint, in 2020, ACS Commissioner David A. Hansell touted an agencywide racial equity audit conducted by an independent party. However, the agency did not release the results of the audit until four months after The Bronx Defenders filed a FOIL request. When the audit report was released in April, it became apparent why ACS had been reluctant to share it, the complaint says.""The damning results concluded that ACS is a predatory system targeting Black parents, holds pervasive anti-Black stereotypes about the ability of Black parents to provide for their children, and presumes Black parents to be a risk to their children,"" the complaint says.The report found that ACS is more likely to give white parents leniency with respect to removals and reunifications of children. It also concluded that agency staff were incentivized to remove children from their homes in order to protect themselves from criticism and retribution from ACS leadership.In their FOIL request, the Bronx Defenders asked ACS to provide information about agency leadership's response to the audit and whether it had moved forward with implementing any of the report's many recommendations. But after months of appeals, ACS declined to provide this information, the complaint says.The Bronx Defenders claim that the agency has not made any changes based on the audit and is hiding how its leadership responded to the feedback.""For years, ACS has paid lip service to recognizing and addressing its own racial bias, choosing instead to evade calls for transparency and reform, which has caused lasting harm to the family sanctity and bonds of generations of New Yorkers,"" Niji Jain, a senior staff attorney at The Bronx Defenders, said in a statement.While aiming to bring more information about the agency to light with one suit, Arnold & Porter is helping Rivers pursue justice with the other. Rivers is seeking damages from the agency for allegedly violating her human rights and causing her, her family and her business unnecessary hardship.Rivers had experienced ""a peaceful pregnancy,"" the complaint says, ""she had been meditating, connecting with her spirituality, and enjoying the sunshine. She was excited for her baby to arrive.""But hospital employees, according to ACS records referenced in the complaint, were concerned Rivers was smoking marijuana in her hospital room after giving birth. Although the complaint says the hospital cited no medical purpose for the test, Rivers was drug-tested against her will, and was denied the chance to take her baby home with her.""When ACS took my baby away from me, I felt lost, empty, and hopeless,"" Rivers said in a statement. ""ACS has been ripping Black families apart for generations, and I'm bringing this case to let Black parents know they have rights to stand up to ACS.""Rivers didn't regain custody of her son until a family court judge released him to her on Sept. 3, more than five days after she had given birth.Still, ACS pressed on with the case against Rivers for months, according to the complaint, which said she was subject to ""intrusive government surveillance of her parenting.""The complaint asserts all the interference was based on Rivers' use of marijuana, though the petition also cited her previous run-ins with ACS more than five years prior, when she was found to be neglectful of her two older children based on allegations of misuse of drugs and alcohol and failure to obtain medical care for her older son.""In reality, ACS knew that these outdated findings were no longer a concern,"" the complaint says. ""Defendants' petition did not allege any evidence of current alcohol use by Ms. Rivers. The hospital never tested Ms. Rivers or (her baby) for alcohol, despite testing for other substances. Nor did Ms. Rivers test positive for alcohol at any time during her pregnancy.""After she was reunited with her son, ACS refused to drop its neglect charges in court. Rivers was required to appear in person for several hearings up until the petition was dropped in December 2021. And in between, ACS staff made repeated unannounced visits to her home, including middle-of-the-night visits. They also didn't wear masks or show her proof of vaccination upon entering her house, the complaint says.""These lawsuits against ACS illustrate how the agency systematically polices marginalized families and tears them apart based on harmful, racist stereotypes about Black parents and families, laying bare the endemic racism and discrimination that lies at the heart of the agency,"" Jain said.The Bronx Defenders are represented in-house by Kshithij Shrinath, Anne Venhuizen and Niji Jain and by Michael Schissel, Melissa Wen and Srinivas Ayyagari of Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer LLP.Rivers is represented by Michael D.

"birth","2023-07-02","Not Discerned","{""FortWorth"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 13:30:54","With so many people sharing their experiences on social media, the platform is a repository of knowledge, tips, and tricks. But while some information available may seem absurd to some and is taken with a pinch of salt, many others tend to (blindly) believe what is being shared on social media. So, when we came across an Instagram reel about how the cat-cow stretch helped a user give birth on all her fours, we decided to dive deeper.  Titled Giving Birth through the Cat-Cow position, the reel shows Macy Pruett giving birth on all fours. “I felt confident and strong in this position, thanks to all of the prenatal training I had done in dozens of variations of it,” she wrote, sharing other clips of practicing the stretch regularly.  She continued, “Once active labour began, my body naturally knew to flip over on my hands and knees. It was the only position that felt right. But the best part was how strong I felt there. I was in active labour for about 35 minutes, and was able to hold myself up in this position through every contraction.”  According to her, training for motherhood trains mothers for all labour positions: all fours, squatting, side-lying, using a birthing ball, lunging, and more.  View this post on Instagram A post shared by Yoga Love (@yogaislove_)  How can moms-to-be trained for delivery?  Dr Sushma Tomar, consultant – obstetrician and gynaecologist, Fortis Hospital, Kalyan said that yoga or any other form of exercise is an important part of pregnancy. “During the third trimester, pelvic exercises are a must to relax pelvic muscles and get them ready to bear down during delivery. For older women who have performed a lot of household work in squatting postures, such as cleaning the floor and sitting in Indian toilets, the need for additional pelvic exercise is reduced,” Dr Tomar told indianexpress.com, adding that women can “bear down pain with the help of pelvic exercises during the time of labour.”  Dr Ritu Sethi, director, Aura Speciality Clinic, Gurgaon, and senior consultant- Cloud Nine Hospital, Gurgaon explained the various positions that can help pregnant women during labour:  Upright positions: Being upright allows gravity to assist in the downward movement of the baby. These positions include:-  *Standing: Standing and swaying, leaning against a wall or partner, or using a birthing ball can help alleviate pressure on the lower back and promote pelvic opening.  *Walking: Walking during labour can help stimulate contractions, encourage progress, and provide a sense of movement and control.  *Squatting: Squatting can open the pelvic outlet and create more space for the baby to descend. It can be done with the support of a partner, a birthing bar, or using a squatting stool.  Advertisement  Sitting and reclining positions: These positions offer support and comfort during labour:  *Sitting: Sitting on a birthing ball, a chair, or a specialised birthing stool can provide stability and relaxation while allowing the pelvis to remain open.  *Semi-reclining: Leaning back on a raised bed or using pillows for support can help reduce fatigue and allow for resting between contractions.  Pregnant women are advised tp workout (Source: Getty Images/Thinkstock) Pregnant women are advised tp workout (Source: Getty Images/Thinkstock)  Side-lying positions: These positions can provide relief and relaxation during labour:  *Side-lying: Lying on one side with knees bent can alleviate pressure on the back and provide a comfortable resting position.  *Simulated side-lying: This position involves propping one leg on a birthing ball or support, which can help open the pelvis and create more space for the baby.  Hands and knees positions: These positions can help relieve back pain and encourage optimal fetal positioning  *All fours: Being on hands and knees, also known as the “crawling” position, can help relieve pressure on the spine and promote proper alignment of the baby.  *Pelvic rocking: Rocking the pelvis back and forth while on all fours can assist in positioning the baby and provide relief from back pain.  Advertisement  So, does the cat-cow stretch help?  The cat-cow pose primarily focuses on stretching and strengthening the muscles of the spine, abdomen, and pelvis. Also known as Marjaryasana-Bitilasana, it is a common yoga pose that involves alternating between arching and rounding the back while on all fours.  Calling it a difficult pose for pregnant women, gynaecologist Dr Manju Gupta said that on all fours is “being advised by yoga trainers for vaginal delivery”. “However it’s to be done only under supervision,” said Dr Gupta.  According to Dr Sethi, “While there is limited scientific research specifically investigating the impact of the cat-cow pose on delivery, it is generally recognised as a beneficial exercise during pregnancy and can potentially contribute to a smoother delivery.”  She added that it, however, helps to improve flexibility, increase circulation, and promote a healthy range of motion in the lower back and pelvic region. “By practicing this pose regularly, pregnant individuals may experience several potential benefits that could positively impact the delivery process.

He was the President of India from 1977 to 1982, the youngest person to assume the post until current President Droupadi Murmu. Reddy participated in the freedom movement from a young age. He was deeply committed to the cause of parliamentary democracy and worked tirelessly to uphold its essential principles. Notably, he faced no opposition during the presidential elections of 1977.  On his birth anniversary, here is everything you need to know about Neelam Sanjiva Reddy:  Early life  Neelam Sanjiva Reddy was born on May 19, 1913, to a Telugu-speaking family in Illur village, which is now part of Andhra Pradesh. Reddy received his education at the Theosophical High School in Adayar, Madras. He then enrolled as an undergraduate at the Government Arts College in Anantapur. In 1929, a momentous event occurred that would shape the course of Reddy’s life. Mahatma Gandhi’s visit to Anantapur made a profound impact on him. Inspired by Gandhi’s principles, Reddy made significant changes in his life. He decided to discontinue his studies and embraced Khadi instead of foreign clothes. In recognition of his contributions to its establishment, Reddy was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Sri Venkateswara University in Tirupati in 1958.  Political career  In 1946, Reddy made his way to the Madras Legislative Assembly as a representative of the Congress party. He served as the Congress secretary and was also a member of the Indian Constituent Assembly. In 1956, when the state of Andhra Pradesh was created, Reddy became its first Chief Minister in October of the same year. He was re-elected as the chief minister in 1962. Reddy had the distinction of serving as the President of the Indian National Congress three times. The politician was a member of the Rajya Sabha thrice in his career. From June 1964, Reddy was the Union Minister of Steel and Mines. Reddy also served as Transport, Civil Aviation, Shipping, and Tourism ministries under Indira Gandhi.  top videos  Tenure as President of India","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzMTguY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9uZWVsYW0tc2Fuaml2YS1yZWRkeS1iaXJ0aC1hbm5pdmVyc2FyeS1hbGwteW91LW5lZWQtdG8ta25vdy1hYm91dC1pbmRpYXMtc2l4dGgtcHJlc2lkZW50LTc4NTMwMjMuaHRtbNIBigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzMTguY29tL2FtcC9saWZlc3R5bGUvbmVlbGFtLXNhbmppdmEtcmVkZHktYmlydGgtYW5uaXZlcnNhcnktYWxsLXlvdS1uZWVkLXRvLWtub3ctYWJvdXQtaW5kaWFzLXNpeHRoLXByZXNpZGVudC03ODUzMDIzLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"birth","2023-05-09","Not Discerned","{""NewYork"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 14:41:00","When students, parents and faculty at the Fort Worth Academy of Fine Arts reached out to two of the school’s most esteemed graduates, Jay Armstrong Johnson and Ahmad Simmons, they didn’t hesitate to help.  Since graduating from the school and performing on Broadway, both alumni have taught master classes at their alma mater and helped with its annual gala.  But this time, the request was different.  Students, parents and others reached out because they were alarmed by a proposed change to the handbooks of two of the school’s esteemed choral groups, the Texas Boys Choir and the Singing Girls of Texas, that would require students to submit unaltered birth certificates. Students would only be allowed to audition or join groups that matched their sex assigned at birth.  “It’s appalling to think that a place that was built on expression and discovery and creativity and relationships and growth would seemingly set policies that reverse the mission and the purpose of existing,” said Simmons, a dancer, choreographer, educator and creative producer in New York City.  Proposed language prioritizes sex assigned at birth  The Texas Boys Choir predates the school and was established in 1946. Its sibling group, Singing Girls of Texas, wasn’t created until 2001 when the Fort Worth performing arts school, commonly called FWAFA, was also established.  Students from more than 30 different North Texas school districts, stretching from Weatherford to Dallas ISDs, are eligible to apply, audition and attend the public arts-focused charter. There is a separate audition process to join either of the choral groups.  The choirs and the public charter school are governed by the nonprofit Texas Center for Arts and Academics, also known as TCA+A. Unlike other public schools, where board members are elected by the public, members of charter school boards are appointed, according to the Texas Education Agency.  Some members, also called directors, of the six-person board requested changes to both groups’ handbooks and added an agenda item for each choir for its May 9 meeting.  According to the agenda, the board went into a closed session for about 30 minutes and then came out to discuss and vote on two motions regarding changes to the handbooks.  A motion to approve minor changes, like updating dates and listed board members, easily passed.  Throughout the public comment portion of the meeting, several attendees expressed concern over other proposed language, including the requirement for students to submit an unaltered birth certificate, proposed definitions of the terms boy and girl in the respective handbooks, and changing existing gender-neutral language to be gendered – like updating “singer” to “girl.”  Board moves to keep ‘traditional’ choir structure, plans survey  A second motion passed with a 4-2 vote, but board chair Daniel Bates and board member Charles Reid have sharply differing views of that motion.  “The 4-2 vote was to adopt a number of revisions, updates, changes to the handbook that would not impact the membership of either of the Texas Boys Choir or the Singing Girls of Texas,” Bates said in a call to The Report.  Bates said the board is doing an additional review of the handbook changes and gathering input. A survey from TCA+A’s “advancement team” will be completed in advance of the June 27 board meeting.  In a video of the meeting reviewed by The Report, Bates said, “The reason the executive board needs the clarifications that it made is because under the current lexicon in our language apparently there is disagreement on what a boy is and what a girl is.”  During the meeting, fellow board member Melissa Goodroe said that the board understood the sentiment in the room but that they also wanted to give people who were not in attendance and who might have different views the opportunity to weigh in.  She also stated the importance of the Texas Boys Choir’s legacy.  “To be honest with you, the schools would not exist without the Texas Boys Choir … so when it comes to making this decision it’s really more than just accommodating a few students. It’s about the organization. We want you to be in a safe place,” she said.  Board members said a survey and further “fact-finding” were in order, but in the interim, the approved motion prohibits students from joining choirs that differ from their sex assigned at birth.  Reid, who was one of the two dissenting board votes, said he opposed the motion because it would not allow nonbinary students to audition for the choir of their choosing, according to the board’s current interpretation of the status quo.  “My whole position was, let’s let the kids do what they want, let them identify as they want and leave things the way they were,” Reid, a retired lawyer and real estate agent, said. “I’m not willing to sacrifice our children on the altar of legacy.”  Fort Worth Report /  ‘We want the artistic director to be able to make that decision’  This year is Wanda F. Bonder’s daughter’s first year at the school.  When Bonder discovered the school, and learned her daughter had been accepted, she described the environment as “a gift from beyond.”  “I actually had not heard of FWAFA until last May … And when I looked at the school and the offerings and the community, I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, I can’t believe that this exists because it is so perfect for my daughter,’” she said.  “Sometimes I drop her off at school feeling so grateful. Because she’s 10, she doesn’t yet understand how life changing it is that she’s found her people at such a young age.”  But Bonder said that she and about 200 other parents at the school have organized out of concern for the school’s environment following the board meeting.  Because her child does not participate in the choir, she said, she was asked by other parents to speak on behalf of the group so that no child in either group is singled out.  “We believe that it would potentially create an environment where kids may not feel welcome to be themselves,” she said.  “We have all shared with each other the many studies about the importance of inclusion, the important role that an arts education can play in the mental health of our children, and we want that to remain the mission and the environment of FWAFA, which is inclusion for all.”  Bonder cited Gov. Greg Abbott’s messaging around parental choice in schools and said the changes are out of step with what the parents at the school would choose.  “There are absolutely children at the school who would not feel welcome and included if they were subjected to these kinds of proposed changes where they have to get an unedited birth certificate in order to try out for a choir,” she said.  “If there is a place for that voice, regardless of the body … we want the artistic director to be able to make the decision based on the goal of the choir.”  Parents are hoping to avoid a situation similar to the one in 2018 where many students and some faculty protested over several personnel changes, including the departure of the principal. Around the same time, parents also expressed concern over the board shrinking from 10 to six, according to reporting from NBC DFW.  “We didn’t want to have big media coverage. We wanted to talk with the board, communicate with the board and work it out. However, we found out that the story has started floating around outside of our parent group. So we think it is important to clarify where we’re coming from,” Bonder said.  “This is not an issue with the president (and) CEO, administration or staff. It is only with the board of directors.”  ‘It truly is the reason for my success’  Courtesy photo / Jay Armstrong Johnson Jay Armstrong Johnson, left, and Ahmad Simmons, right, are alumni of the Fort Worth Academy of Fine Arts, and both perform on Broadway.  Armstrong Johnson, Fort Worth Academy of Fine Arts alumnus, talked fondly about his time at the school.  “I think it was hard for me growing up in the early 2000s, being a queer child and not being able to find a niche that I fit into. And when I found the arts, I finally found my people,” Armstrong Johnson said. “I found my other misfit toys. I found the other boys that liked to sing and dance and the community that supported that. The arts were a safe haven away from bullying, away from fear.”  Hearing that students who identify outside of the male or female binary could lose their chance to participate in these select choirs was upsetting, Armstrong Johnson said.  “What that school did for me and my generation was huge for our development and for our confidence, and I only want it to progress forward for other marginalized communities and to have it do the same thing for them that it did for me.”  Simmons, who attended the school from fourth through 12th grade, also found the discussion upsetting. Participating in the storied Texas Boys Choir was an artistic refuge for him, and he still credits it for his success today.  “I would say it made my life … It helped me not follow a path I could have easily followed because of things I saw around me,” Simmons said. “It truly is the reason for my success, and who I am as a son, as a colleague, artist and community member. It’s the reason for that.”  Marcheta Fornoff covers the arts for the Fort Worth Report. Contact her at marcheta.fornoff@fortworthreport.org or on Twitter.

"birth","2017-07-10","Not Discerned","{""SanDiego"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 09:30:15","Share this:  As the population ages and becomes more health-conscious, a new retail category is emerging — specialty storefront wellness. We’ll cover other multi-location brands in high-growth industries and category creators in the months ahead.  Wellness is a $450B category and is rapidly accelerating. Multi-location retailers are picking up on that and launching products and brands that help us live longer and feel better.  Runners usually stretch before they pick up speed. Stretching has also long been part of physical therapy.  Stretch Zone founder Jorden Gold decided to bring assisted stretching to the masses after his grandfather lost mobility due to diabetes. Stretching appeared to be the silver bullet, and Gold’s beloved “Pop-Pop” ultimately graduated from a walker to the dance floor. But assisted stretching has now taken hold for all ages and activity levels.  Founded in 2004, the Stretch Zone franchise opened its first storefront in 2017 and now has approximately 300 locations and continues to expand, and the company’s gross revenue has grown a whopping 52 percent year-over-year. It is reportedly the largest stretching franchise in the U.S., and national and regional competitors are emerging.  Like many concepts that have been recently created, Stretch Zone incorporated technology from its inception. The company invested in awareness-building and search by utilizing SOCI for local search optimization. Digital marketing is a big component of its advertising mix. The Stretch Zone app enables consumers to easily book appointments. Creating a new category requires an extra level of consumer education. “The cheese is always moving,” says Lindsey McFadden, the company’s Marketing VP.  Stretch Zone has three corporate stores, but the rest are franchised, and many operators own multiple locations. An average of two new stores open each week. Remarkably, no stores have closed to date.  Taking a mere eight weeks from signing to build-out, the Stretch Zone concept was designed to be a relatively simple franchise concept for investors. As in many franchises, corporate supports the local operators with a wide range of approved vendors.  The locations use a proprietary combination of tables and straps, and athletes have endorsed the brand, encouraging franchisees and consumers to engage in local charities via its GivZone program. NFL player Drew Brees has signed on as a franchisee, joining the many celebrities investing in retail and restaurant opportunities.  Especially as we spend more time at desks and in front of screens, stretching becomes increasingly vital to health and well-being. Scientific studies (and Pop-Pop) may prove its many benefits, including increasing your body’s serotonin levels. That hormone stabilizes moods and reduces stress.  As consumers become more aware of the many benefits of the habit, “stretching near me” is likely to become a more common search phrase.  Lessons learned from the StretchZone launch include:  Use personal experiences to create a new category, but ensure consumer trends, facts, and science support it.  Create a footprint that’s fast and easy to replicate and scale.  Engage celebrities in endorsing your brand.  Gather compelling testimonials to accelerate word-of-mouth.  When you operate nationally you can still give franchisees local decision-making input.  Invest in local search and digital media.  The U.S. population is aging. A whopping 50 percent of the population reports wellness as a top priority.  Gold and other founders see opportunities in this trend and realize that multi-location retailers must create concepts that bring healthier living to consumers’ neighborhoods.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vc3RyZWV0ZmlnaHRtYWcuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTgvYm91dGlxdWUtaGVhbHRoLXdlbGxuZXNzLXRoZS1iaXJ0aC1hbmQtZXhwYW5zaW9uLW9mLXN0cmV0Y2gtem9uZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"birth","2023-03-03","Not Discerned","{""Tokyo"", ""Tokyo"", ""Japan""}","Thu 18 May 2023 10:07:12","TOKYO >> Postpartum care services at a central Tokyo hotel are becoming increasingly popular among new mothers.  Last year Japan logged fewer than 800,000 annual births for the first time, and a survey showed that some women were deciding against having a second child due to the physical and mental strain of giving birth.  “Enhancing postpartum care is an effective measure to counteract the declining birthrate,” one expert said. “The national and local governments should expand such support.”  In early March several babies slept peacefully in cribs in a room at Hotel Metropolitan Edmont Tokyo in the capital’s Chiyoda ward. When one of the infants began crying, he was immediately soothed by nursery staff.  “Mamma Levata” is a round-the-clock serv­ice staffed by a total of 30 nurses and caregivers who bathe the babies and change their diapers. Mothers, meanwhile, are free to sleep in another room, go shopping or visit a beauty salon. The moms can also receive assistance on their breastfeeding technique.  Although pricey — rates start at nearly $455 per night — a total of 200 groups of women have used the service since it began in November, and reservations this month are fully booked.  Yoko Yamada, 31, of Tokorozawa in Saitama, stayed at the hotel with her newborn son and 22-month-old daughter.  “I had been so busy with child care, but (at the hotel) I was able to totally relax. I asked the nursery staff about the correct way to breastfeed and give baths, which gave me confidence and motivation for future child care,” Yamada said.  With the social shift toward nuclear families, many women are unable to call upon the support of their parents after giving birth.  In some cases, the COVID-19 pandemic has made it impossible for women to travel back and forth to their parents’ homes, and the hotel service has become an alternative means to support.  With the physical strain of childbirth and the mental strain of sleep deprivation, 1 in 10 women who give birth is vulnerable to postpartum depression, according to a survey conducted in fiscal 2021 by the Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry.  In a 2022 survey by the Japan Women Foundation, which works to support reproductive health, 90% of approximately 6,500 respondents suffered post-childbirth symptoms such as lower back pain. Nearly half said they felt lonely and anxious for no reason. Because of such issues, 4.9% said they “gave up” on trying to have a second or subsequent child.  To help alleviate postpartum stress, the ministry launched a system in 2015 to subsidize 50% of the costs for postpartum care services outsourced by local governments to hospitals, midwifery centers and other facilities. According to the ministry, municipalities using the program increased from 4% in fiscal 2015 to 80% in fiscal 2021.  Meanwhile, more and more hotels are offering postpartum care services, including in Funabashi, Kawasaki and other cities. In December 2021 a dedicated hotel opened in Yokosuka in Kanagawa, overlooking the sea. Another hotel opened in Kyoto City in June. But according to the ministry, only a few municipalities outsource their operations to hotels.  “If holistic support is available after childbirth, more women will want to have another baby,” said Kaori Ichikawa, professor of maternal nursing at Tokyo University of Information Sciences. “The national government should secure midwives and nursery staff, and local governments should expand the number of outsourcing companies, including hotels. Another effective measure would be for companies to introduce (postpartum care) services as part of their (benefits) programs.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJhZHZlcnRpc2VyLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE4L25ld3MvaG90ZWxzLWNhdGVyLXRvLW5ldy1wYXJlbnRzLXdpdGgtMjQtaG91ci1zZXJ2aWNlcy_SAWVodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGFyYWR2ZXJ0aXNlci5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8xOC9uZXdzL2hvdGVscy1jYXRlci10by1uZXctcGFyZW50cy13aXRoLTI0LWhvdXItc2VydmljZXMvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"birth","2023-05-17","18:00:00","Not Discerned","Fri 19 May 2023 00:00:23","The birthing process is intense – no matter which way you go about it. I mean, you’re bringing a human into the world. I had two experiences, one – a Cesarean section and another, a vaginal birth.  These experiences couldn’t be any more different.  My first experience was a Cesarean section and it was elective. I was pregnant with twins and as someone who had never birthed a child (let alone two children), I was terrified that going through with a vaginal birth would require that I do both. For example, if Baby A came out vaginally, there was always the possibility that Baby B would be positioned incorrectly for a vaginal birth and I’d have to go through with a Cesarean Section anyway. So, I elected to have a Cesarean section so I wouldn’t have to recover from both deliveries separately.  The Cesarean was very impersonal. I walked to the surgical room where everyone was suited up in medical garb ready to deliver the babies. I was given a shot of spinal anesthesia, which wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be. I was expecting the worst, but it really didn’t hurt, it just freaked me out, as shots normally do.  I felt it was rushed, even though it wasn’t an emergency surgery. As I laid down, they started cutting into my abdomen and within minutes, the babies were out. They were taken to a table to be assessed after birth so I didn’t really get to see them right away – I just heard their cries.  I was then sent into the recovery room where we finally were able to bond. I was pretty drowsy from the anesthesia so I didn’t really get to experience what was really happening. I had just had two babies but I was out of it enough that I was unable to fully appreciate the moment.  Recovery was rough. What I didn’t realize is I would still bleed like I had a vaginal delivery. I couldn’t get up and move right away because of the numbness, but even when it wore off, I still didn’t get up and walk right away because of the pain. My husband at the time had to do a lot of the diaper changing while also taking care of me.  I couldn’t drive for many weeks after the delivery and moving around was tough until about the second week. I had and still have a scar across my lower abdomen that was numb for a long time. While a scar isn’t much fun to have, it is a reminder that I brought life into the world.  My vaginal birth was much different as I went into labor on my own.  My contractions started during the evening and I labored throughout the night into the next morning. Then we went to the hospital where I had a nice laboring room – and of course, a delivery music playlist. At first, I did not have an epidural so I could move around the hospital, laboring while walking and sometimes dancing.  I spent most of the day laboring and finally, at 7 centimeters, I opted for an epidural. This slowed down the process significantly. I stayed at 7 centimeters for hours and they even put me in a position with a ball to speed up the delivery process like it had been before the epidural. I had anxiety during this time – more time to think about what was happening to me.  Finally, that night, I started to push. Pushing was exhausting and I was very thirsty. After I pushed him through the birth canal, I realized I had to deliver the placenta – which I didn’t know beofre. I also didn’t realize how much I would tear and how long it would take to be sewn up. Just after he was born, I was able to bring him to my chest and bond with him right away, which I liked and was very different from the Cesarean section.  Recovery was better than my previous experience. Though I was numb for a little while post-delivery from the epidural, I was able to get up and move pretty quickly after the birth. I felt I was more active in the post-delivery process by changing diapers, etc.  After we left the hospital, recovery was harder for me than most. I had to go under a surgical procedure because I was still torn from the birth. I knew something wasn’t right, but we didn’t know what it was until a year later when I had the surgery.  Overall, my birth experiences couldn’t be any more different; however, I wouldn’t do it any other way because today, I have three healthy, thriving children. And that is all that matters.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vY2luY2lubmF0aS5tb21jb2xsZWN0aXZlLmNvbS9kZWxpdmVyeS1leHBlcmllbmNlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Everyone is going through the internet to know more about viral news. The public is going through the internet to know if this news is true or not. For our readers, we have brought the information about this ongoing news. The readers can find all the details about the ongoing viral news. Keep scrolling through the article to know more about it.  Jennifer Burrows Arrested and Charged  Jennifer Burrows, a mortuary employee, was detained when a DNA test indicated that her newborn kid was born as a result of necrophilic encounters with a deceased person she was supposed to be autopsying. The woman is allegedly said to have sexually assaulted numerous bodies over the course of the previous two years. People are debating whether the report is true or false as it has become widely circulated on social media. Many people have made headlines after taking the news seriously. The report is false, though. In October 2016, a parody website called “world news daily report” first published it. A new version of the false report has started making the rounds on social media.  People became fascinated by the content and began creating memes and articles about it as a result of its surprise and peculiar complexity. Another satirical website called Dead Serious News published a similar story in November 2010 in which it was claimed that a 38-year-old mortuary worker fell pregnant after having sex with a dead man whom she was burying. The story appears to have been reused by The World News Daily when they created the arrest of Jennifer Burrows story. A disclaimer stating that all the characters and circumstances are fictional was mentioned on the website. However, because the news is so compelling, many have already spread inaccurate information.  The website’s disclaimer states that “World News Daily Report bears full responsibility for the satirical and fictional nature of its publications. Even characters based on real people are wholly fictional in the writings on this website. Any similarity between them and any living, deceased, or undead individual will be a miracle, the statement continues. As has already been stated, the viral narrative is made up and phony. As a result, Jennifer Burrows, a mortuary employee, doesn’t exist in reality. The fictional description describes Jennifer Burrows as a 26-year-old mortuary employee. She works for the Jackson County medical examiner services as an assistant pathologist.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vcGtibmV3cy5pbi9qZW5uaWZlci1idXJyb3dzLWFycmVzdGVkL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The now 42-year-old was speaking to hosts Sean Hayes and Dr. Priyanka Wali on the HypochondriActor podcast.  The star, who played the role of Doctor April Kepner for nine seasons, revealed how a traumatic birth scene 'induced her own labor' a month early.  She said that she had initially been overwhelmed with guilt after thinking she had 'chosen her career over the safety of her baby' - but has since acknowledged that it was not her fault.  Grey's Anatomy star Sarah Drew has revealed how her acting on set (pictured) unintentionally induced her own premature labor  Sarah said that just 10 hours after filming the birth scene (pictured) she went into labor one month early  The actress revealed that the storyline saw her character (pictured) pregnant with a child that had a fatal disease which was causing it pain  In the podcast episode, which was released on Wednesday, Sarah explained the shocking situation.  Speaking about her appearance on Season 11 of Grey's Anatomy, she said: 'I was playing a story where I was pregnant and my child in utero had a fatal disease that was causing it pain.  'I had to do an induction termination and hold the baby while it died in my arms - and I had to shoot the delivery and death scene like when I was eight months pregnant.'  The star continued: 'I shot that scene. You see the pain in my face and it was done sort of stylized so I wasn't coughing and pushing or whatever [but] I'm clenching in order to create what it looks like ""my god, I feel like the baby's coming.""  'And then I'm holding this little animatronic baby as it like, dies in my arms.'  Shockingly, Sarah then said: '10 hours later, I went into premature labor.'  The actress, who claimed she had 'induced her own labor,' revealed that she had not been prepared at all.  And, worryingly, her newborn daughter spent 11 days in the neonatal intensive care unit over respiratory issues.

Both faced a challenging pregnancy, expecting the birth of conjoined twins with a shared heart and vital organs.  Since the 22nd week of pregnancy, the community has united in prayer through a series of rosaries organized by Detroit Catholic en Español, providing support and accompaniment to the young couple at each stage of their difficult journey.  Nicole and Austin's testimony of faith has transcended religious boundaries, touching the hearts of Catholics and non-Catholics alike, who have been moved and inspired by their story. The couple has faced unimaginable challenges throughout the entire process, but their trust and hope in God's will have never wavered.  From their faith, they are fully convinced that babies fulfill a mission and purpose that transcend limited human understanding. This way of embracing God's will and love for him has brought them comfort and strength, finding support in prayer and the love of their family, friends and community.  One of Nicole’s deepest desires was that the babies could be baptized and confirmed at birth.  After medical evaluations, doctors predicted the babies could live until the 35th week, which would be in early June, at which time a cesarean section would be performed.  However, due to inadequate blood flow for the babies and the importance of their live birth, the doctors scheduled delivery by cesarean section for May 16.  On the eve of the surgery, Nicole asked for prayer through Detroit Catholic en Español.  ""Right now, I pray that the angels and saints are present during the surgery. I ask God to guide the hands of the surgeons and that everything goes smoothly, for my speedy recovery,"" she said. ""I also hope that my girls will be born alive, so they can be baptized right at birth and can easily go to Jesus. They probably won't survive more than a day or two, but only God knows in the end.""  The Detroit community responded with fervent prayers, and God's miracle was not long in coming, allowing the babies to be born, baptized, confirmed, and receive the full love of their parents.  Afterward, Mia Duque, Nicole's younger sister, tweeted: ""Hello everyone, I'm Mia, Nicole's younger sister. I am writing on behalf of her and Austin to inform you that the babies have been born and have been baptized and confirmed.""  She added, ""They breathed to their last breath and are now in the arms of Our Lord. To those who prayed for us, thank you.""  Despite the immense pain that accompanies the loss of their beloved daughters, Nicole and Austin found comfort and strength in their unwavering faith. They persevered in the confidence that divine plans are perfect, and their fervent prayers were heard.  Yanira Duque, Nicole’s mother and coordinator of the Hispanic ministry of St. Mary in Wayne, expressed her gratitude for the grace of God, which allowed the birth, baptism and confirmation of her beloved granddaughters, and warmly thanked Detroit Catholic en Español for the prayers and support of the community.  Nicole and Austin's testimony as parents, marked by their steadfast faith, continues to be an inspiration that touches many hearts. The mission of Maria Teresa and Rachel Clare, who are now in the presence of the Lord, will be honored through the remarkable pro-life work done by their parents and family.  The story of Nicole, Austin, and their precious daughters is a reminder of the importance of hope, faith and love in times of adversity. Although the lives of María Teresa and Rachel Clare were brief, their impact and legacy will live on in the pro-life work that their parents carry out with dedication and commitment.  Through their testimony of faith, Nicole and Austin have become a source of inspiration for those facing difficult and challenging pregnancies.  The family of Nicole Duque and Austin LeBlanc have expressed deep appreciation to the community for being in constant prayer for them. People are invited to continue interceding so that the family finds comfort and strength in their faith during this difficult time.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vYW5nZWx1c25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvbGlmZS1mYW1pbHkvcHJvLWxpZmUtZGV0cm9pdC1jb25qb2luZWQtdHdpbnMtYm9ybi1iYXB0aXplZC_SAVxodHRwczovL2FuZ2VsdXNuZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xpZmUtZmFtaWx5L3Byby1saWZlLWRldHJvaXQtY29uam9pbmVkLXR3aW5zLWJvcm4tYmFwdGl6ZWQvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(Photo: VNA)  Kandel said she found it extraordinary that President Ho Chi Minh spent nearly three decades on travelling around the world to find a path for national salvation. During this journey, the President studied different forms of western governments to find the most suitable approach to bring freedom and independence to the country that had been invaded by many nations for hundreds of years. More importantly, it was about finding a way to help Vietnam become an independent and self-reliant nation.    According to her, President Ho Chi Minh determined the correct path for national liberation by referring to western models while considering the specific characteristics and practical conditions of the country. She believed that Ho Chi Minh's thought is the foundation for Vietnam's achievements, as the country has transformed from a nation that suffered significant losses to a country that has achieved freedom, independence and built its own identity. Vietnam has become a peaceful and hospitable nation.  She said President Ho Chi Minh selectively chose and decided on the most suitable approach to liberate the nation and achieve freedom, rather than rigidly applying western models. She added that it is also the approach taken by FTW in its activities in Vietnam.    Founded in 2002 in the UK, FTW sent over 100 Vietnamese doctors to leading hospitals in the UK, Australia, Canada and the US for training. The FTW also funded remote medical equipment and technology for craniofacial surgical centres in Vietnam, with a total value of 2.4 million GBP (3 million USD).    Over the next five years, FTW plans to support 40,000 craniofacial surgeries for children performed by Vietnamese doctors. It also aims to send 200 Vietnamese doctors for further training abroad while continuing to fund medical equipment and telemedicine technology.  Meanwhile, Aleksandr Sokolovskyi, a scholar of Vietnamese studies, head of the Department for South and Southeast Asian Countries at the Russia’s Far Eastern Federal University's Institute of Oriental Studies and Honorary Chairman of the Russia-Vietnam Friendship Association in Primorye province, said President Ho Chi Minh has had a profound impact on the Vietnamese people. He is a shining example of dedicating his entire life to liberating the people from colonial rule.    On May 17, a delegation from the Vietnamese Embassy in France and leaders of France’s Montreuil suburban city offered incense to the late President at Montreau park.    Later, they visited the Ho Chi Minh Space located within the Living History Museum where numerous artifacts and materials related to him are preserved.  An incense-offering ceremony was also held in Ho Chi Minh memorial site in Xieng Vang village, Nongbok district, the central Lao province of Khammoune.    On the occasion, the delegates also offered incense and laid a wreath at the Laos-Vietnam Fighting Alliance Monument.    Speaking at the special programme “Diplomatic World” of Venezuela’s Radio Mundial on May 17, Vietnamese Ambassador to Venezuela Vu Trung My affirmed that Vietnam always values traditional solidarity and friendship with friends and important partners in Latin America, including the Vietnam-Venezuela comprehensive partnership.    He committed his utmost efforts to push forward the bilateral ties, especially at a time when the two nations are looking toward the 35th anniversary of bilateral diplomatic ties next year.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL2VuZ2xpc2gudm92LnZuL2VuL3BvbGl0aWNzL3ZhcmlvdXMtYWN0aXZpdGllcy1oZWxkLWFicm9hZC10by1jZWxlYnJhdGUtcHJlc2lkZW50LWhvLWNoaS1taW5ocy1iaXJ0aC1hbm5pdmVyc2FyeS1wb3N0MTAyMTA3Ni52b3bSAYkBaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudm92LnZuL2VuL3BvbGl0aWNzL3ZhcmlvdXMtYWN0aXZpdGllcy1oZWxkLWFicm9hZC10by1jZWxlYnJhdGUtcHJlc2lkZW50LWhvLWNoaS1taW5ocy1iaXJ0aC1hbm5pdmVyc2FyeS1wb3N0MTAyMTA3Ni52b3Y_cGFnZT0?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Repair Shop star, 53, opened up about the number of people his biological father, whom he refers to as the “man who contributed towards my birth”, has fathered over the years.  Blades revealed that he has found 27 brothers and sisters, but believes there are “loads” more who could be residing in the UK, US and Jamaica.  The presenter’s mother, Barbara, gave birth to him when she was 16 or 17. He said that his biological father “promised [her] that he [was] going to get a flat and they’re going to live happily ever after”.  However, he ended up “taking the money and left [my mother] high and dry”. Blades and his mother later found shelter in a women’s refuge, before going to live with her uncle and then getting a council house.  His biological father reappeared in his life when he was five years old and again when Blades was in his early twenties.  “I knew I had more brothers and sisters, and when I went to London with [the man who contributed to my birth] and met the people he was living with, there were four there,” Blades recalled in an appearance on The Big Fish podcast with Spencer Matthews.  “I said to him, ‘I know there’s more, I remember meeting a sister that was older than me, when you had me at five’. And he said, ‘No, no’. I said, ‘Are you sure?’ ‘No, no, no, there’s no more.”  But the Money For Nothing star said his half-sister called him to tell him there were “loads more” siblings, specifying that there were 25.  (BBC/Ricochet Ltd)  “That’s just in this country,” he said. “There’s some in Jamaica and some in America as well. I think he used to be a rabbit. I did challenge him after, and I’ve met 11 of them.”  Asked if there were siblings he hasn’t met, Blades said: “100 per cent loads. And since being on TV, two more have come out of the woodwork… A lot of them don’t want to be found and don’t want to be related to the man who’s contributed towards my birth because he’s put nothing into them. Some of them feel shame.”  Story continues  Blades added that he has a “real problem” with his biological father, to whom he had only spoken to “about four times in my entire life”.  He recalled the last conversation they had, during which his biological father said he had a “picture frame” that needed repairing.  “I was like, ‘There’s appropriate channels, go to the BBC website’. And he’s like, ‘You don’t know who this is, do you?’  “’I said, ‘I know who this is, this is the man that contributed towards my birth. What is it you’re after?’”  Blades’ biological father then claimed that “everything you’re doing is because of me” and said he was responsible for the presenter’s success.  “So I said to him, I don’t know how you’ve worked that out, but one thing I must give you is this – you have taught me how not to be a father, and I can thank you for that. So if you have nothing further to say, I just want to bid you good day’.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vamF5LWJsYWRlcy1iZWxpZXZlcy1sb2Fkcy1tb3JlLTE0MzIxNTcwMS5odG1s0gFMaHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9hbXBodG1sL2pheS1ibGFkZXMtYmVsaWV2ZXMtbG9hZHMtbW9yZS0xNDMyMTU3MDEuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The survey was designed to assess current knowledge and understanding of birth control usage, affordability and beliefs in the United States at a time when women's healthcare choices are being limited or revoked. The survey identified discrepancies in healthcare professional perceptions of their patients' preferences about birth control and factors that influence selection. The survey also sought to explore possible reasons why, despite increased availability of birth control options for women over the past two decades, 45% of pregnancies in the U.S. remain unplanned.1  The parallel-track survey consisted of more than 5,000 women aged 18-55 (n=5,052) and 506 HCPs (OB/GYNs, NPs/PAs and FPs). Survey respondents were recruited through a proprietary market panel and the patient survey was balanced to U.S. census for race and ethnicity. The survey was developed with help and input from an expert panel including Sharon D. Allison-Ottey, M.D., Paula M. Castaño, M.D, MPH, and Donnica Moore, M.D.  Findings of the survey showed that of those individuals who are concerned with unwanted pregnancy [51% of respondents], 40% were not on birth control and 35% did not trust their birth control. Further, less than half of respondents said they discussed contraceptives with their HCP at their annual exam, while 74% of HCPs reported discussing birth control with their patients.  ""We have to encourage better conversation between women of reproductive age and their healthcare professionals to ensure that women are being informed of their birth control options,"" said Beth Battaglino, RN-C, CEO of HealthyWomen.  Story continues  ""The survey calls for us to re-visit — and perhaps even re-invent — patient-HCP interactions to ensure contraceptive solutions are tailored to meet each individual's needs; further, we must continue to call for development of even more innovative contraception options that meet the quickly changing needs of individuals of childbearing age,"" continued Battaglino.  The survey was conducted in the fall of 2022, just months after the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade; therefore, questions were included to assess the impact to patient care. Based upon the ruling, 21% of patients indicated they changed or planned to change their contraceptive method, and 27% of HCPs indicated they changed the way they counsel their patients about contraceptives.  Other findings from the survey include:  Of the patients surveyed, 60% reported they prefer hormone-free birth control, and while 64% of HCPs believe their patients prefer hormone-free birth control, most (59%) recommend hormonal methods.  Effectiveness was the most important factor in choosing a contraceptive for 91% of patients surveyed; however, only 26% were aware that intrauterine devices (IUDs) are more effective than widely used oral contraceptives and condoms. Other important factors when choosing a contraceptive included ease of use, comfort, side effects and cost.  While nearly half of women prefer to have a regular menstrual cycle or period (49%), only 37% desire no period. Those who prefer a period do so because ""having a regular period makes me feel like my body is doing what it should be doing"" (78%) and regular periods also provide a ""peace of mind that I'm probably not pregnant (51%).""  ""Sebela would like to thank HealthyWomen for conducting this timely survey, further supporting their leadership position when it comes to trusted resources for women's health,"" said Kelly Culwell, MD, Head of Research and Development, Sebela Women's Health Inc. ""The survey reinforces our belief that we need to continue to provide women with innovative and effective hormone-free contraceptive options to meet their preferences and find ways to improve the dialogue between patients and their healthcare providers when it comes to birth control.""

This groundbreaking study sheds light on the potential impact of hormonal changes caused by birth control on mental well-being, offering valuable insights for healthcare professionals in identifying women at risk.  Let's dive deeper into this key topic and explore how birth control can affect your mental health.  Understanding the link: Hormonal birth control and postpartum depression  The study, conducted by researchers at the University of Copenhagen, examined the health data of nearly 200,000 first-time mothers.  It found that women who experienced a medically treated depressive episode shortly after starting birth control were more likely to develop postpartum depression.  That suggests that some women may be more susceptible to the hormonal changes triggered by both birth control and pregnancy, potentially leading to mental health challenges.  Hormonal changes and postpartum depression  Postpartum depression and hormones (Image via Freepik)  During pregnancy and delivery, women undergo significant hormonal changes that can contribute to development of postpartum depressive episodes.  Researchers have found that depression related to hormonal changes, like those caused by initiating hormonal birth control, can also be associated with postpartum depression.  This crucial insight emphasizes the importance of recognizing the impact of hormonal sensitivity on mental well-being throughout a woman's reproductive life.  Identifying women at risk  By understanding the link between hormonal birth control and postpartum depression, healthcare professionals, including midwives and doctors, can better identify women who may be at risk.  This knowledge enables proactive measures to be taken, potentially preventing or managing postpartum depression more effectively. Identifying women who have experienced depression after starting hormonal birth control can provide valuable insights into their mental health history and help tailor appropriate care and support.  Preventive birth control depression  How to prevent hormone related mental health imbalance? (Image via Freepik)  The findings from the aforementioned study offer a significant opportunity for the development of preventive strategies for managing postpartum depression.  By recognizing the women who may be more susceptible to hormonal changes, healthcare professionals can offer personalized support and interventions. This understanding could make a real difference in ensuring the well-being of new mothers and their infants.  A step towards better mental health support  The research conducted by the University of Copenhagen sheds light on the potential impact of hormonal birth control on postpartum depression risk. While the study focused on severe cases requiring medical treatment, it highlights the need for further exploration into milder cases and mental side effects.  By expanding our knowledge in this area, we can provide better mental health support to women and enhance their overall well-being during the postpartum period.  The connection between hormonal birth control and postpartum depression is an essential area of research that offers valuable insights into women's mental health.  By understanding the impact of hormonal changes caused by birth control and pregnancy, healthcare professionals can provide targeted support to women at risk.

Previously, she worked as an associate producer at Kentucky Educational Television (KET) producing stories on the commonwealth’s diverse regions and contributing to state legislature coverage. She also worked as a news assistant at the PBS NewsHour, interned at WAMU 88.5, and was a Fulbright English teaching assistant in Russia. Gabriela holds a master’s degree in multiplatform journalism from the University of Maryland.    Gabriela was born and raised in Puerto Rico. She is fluent in Spanish, English and Russian.  Commonwealth Media Services  A nonprofit collaborating with state agencies and lawmakers is trying to expand doula services. The goal is to reduce the state’s maternal mortality rate, especially in communities of color, where that rate tends to be higher.  Doulas, who are non-medical professionals who provide emotional, physical and educational support to patients during pregnancy, are not part of the state Medicaid network, which is the health insurance plan that many low-income people rely on.  The Pennsylvania Doula Commission, founded in 2021, wants to prepare doulas to eventually join the state Medicaid system. It is offering a scholarship to pay the $50 application fee for perinatal doula certifications.  While a perinatal doula certification is not required to practice as a doula, it sets a pathway to get Medicaid reimbursement, said Gerria Coffee, president of PADC. Certification could help create a standard for the state Department of Human Services to recognize doulas as providers.  “Very few organizations or doulas throughout Pennsylvania are actually working with managed care organizations,” Coffee said. “There are a few, but very few and not all doulas have received the education necessary or the support necessary to be able to fill out claims for reimbursement.”  Because of not being able to get reimbursements, doulas often do not make enough money to live off that profession, regardless of how many hours they spend with their patients. Doulas often pay for their own gas and supplies, so, in the end, their take-home pay is reduced. That is why some doulas approach the job as a “side hustle,” Coffee said.  Pennsylvania ranks 37th out of 50 in the United States for doula salaries, according to ZipRecruiter.  Sharee Lynn Livingston, an OB-GYN physician and co-founder of Diversifying Doulas in Lancaster County, said doula state certification could improve doula interaction with hospitals and doctors  “As long as we’re centering the doula, then it’s a win-win,” Livingston said. “I know that you can provide excellent doula care, without certification, without these name badges, if you will.”  But there are other ways of integrating doulas in the healthcare system. For example, a “fee-for- service” system.  “If there’s a patient that comes in who I think would benefit from a doula, then I note in the chart that this patient would benefit from doula care, and the insurance then pays a fee for service for that doula,” Livingston said. “I think that there are many pathways to getting doulas paid appropriately.”  PADC’s stipends come from the Jewish Healthcare Foundation, which is acting as a fiscal agent for federal Coronavirus State Fiscal Recovery Funds provided through the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services.  Earlier in the year, Democratic state House lawmakers pledged to address the state’s maternal mortality crisis. A 2022 report from the Pennsylvania Maternal Mortality Review Committee found the state has a pregnancy-associated mortality ratio (PAMR) of 82 deaths per 100,000 live births. Black women in the United States are three times more likely to die in childbirth, according to the CDC.  State Sen. Judy Schwank, D-Berks State and Rep. Morgan Cephas, D-Philadelphia re-introduced companions bills to extend Medicaid coverage to doulas.  Increased access to doulas is seen as one of the solutions for improving birth outcomes in the state. Multiple studies have shown that having a doula reduces the risk of maternal death. Patients who give birth with a doula are more likely to have a shorter labor, according to a report from the National Institutes of Health. Doula-assisted mothers were also less likely to have a baby born with a low birth rate.  Doulas also help patients with language barriers. The Pennsylvania Doula Commission will have an equity commission in July that will target bilingual doulas.  “Having someone, especially when you’re in a situation where you may not have that much family around, that’s speaking to you in your native tongue and that understands your needs culturally and is there with a mindset of providing and protecting you – that lowers stress levels and improves health outcomes, not just for the mother or birthing parent, but also for the baby,” Coffee said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd2l0Zi5vcmcvMjAyMy8wNS8xOC9wZW5uc3lsdmFuaWEtZG91bGFzLWNhbi1ub3ctZ2V0LWZ1bmRpbmctdG8tYXBwbHktZm9yLWEtc3RhdGUtY2VydGlmaWNhdGUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Founded in 1997, the Connecticut Childbirth & Women's Center is located across the street from Danbury Hospital. Senate Bill 986, ""AN ACT PROTECTING MATERNAL HEALTH,"" as proposed by Governor Ned Lamont, would create a new and separate licensing category for stand-alone, private birthing centers staffed by midwives like the Connecticut Childbirth & Women's Center.  The Connecticut Childbirth & Women’s Center is one of the nearly 250 accredited birthing centers in the United States and is the only one in Connecticut. Staffed by a team of midwives, its homelike atmosphere meets all local, state, and federal health, fire and safety regulations and is licensed by the state Department of Public Health.  According to the Peterson-Kaiser Family Foundation, the average hospital birth in America costs $18,865, including pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum care. The Connecticut Childbirth & Women's Center charges a flat fee of $8,500.  ""The Connecticut Childbirth Center has really been a trailblazer for a quarter-century here in Connecticut. It's enormously popular and very successful, and it’s really the template for what other such private birthing centers could be created around Connecticut under this new proposed licensing system,"" said Sen. Kushner, who has been working with DPH and the Childbirth Center on details of the legislation. ""Not every woman wants to deliver in a hospital setting. Not every family wants to or can afford to pay their share of an $18,000 hospital bill. For those people seeking an alternative, but who still want caring and professional medical attention, the Connecticut Childbirth center is there for therm. It's a model that should be replicated across the state.""  ""Allowing more opportunities for birth options is something we should be doing more of in Connecticut, and Governor Lamont's bill will help give women more opportunities,"" Commissioner Juthani said. ""This bill is about choice, and the state Health Department is committed to working with birth centers and hospitals to make life better for Connecticut families.""  ""The biggest difference this bill will make is that there will be more birthing centers throughout Connecticut. Right now, the licensing process is both tedious and expensive. This bill will reduce that,"" said Cathy Parisi, Director of Midwifery and the Center. ""This bill will encourage more women to give birth at birthing centers.""  -30-","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitQFodHRwOi8vd3d3LmVpbm5ld3MuY29tL3ByX25ld3MvNjM0NTc1MjU2L2NvbW1pc3Npb25lci1qdXRoYW5pLWFuZC1zZW4ta3VzaG5lci10b3VyLWNvbm5lY3RpY3V0LWNoaWxkYmlydGgtd29tZW4tcy1jZW50ZXItaW4tYWR2YW5jZS1vZi1iaWxsLXRvLWNyZWF0ZS1maXJzdC1ldmVyLWJpcnRoLWNlbnRlci1saWNlbnNl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

For Natasha Green, this cause hits close to home - she gave birth to her daughter, Jurni, six months ago, who was stillborn. She's now volunteering with Push For Empowered Pregnancy to create changes for mothers.  The goal of the bill is to provide paid family leave for mothers after they have a stillbirth. Right now, mothers like Green don't have that eligibility.  ""They don't realize that still birth involves actually giving birth to a full-size baby and they don't realize that still birth moms are going through all of the same post-partum effects as anybody else that gives birth,"" said Samantha Banerjee, executive director of Push For Empowered Pregnancy.  Banerjee founded the nonprofit after giving birth to her stillborn daughter, Alana. She says she thinks the oversight in policy comes from legislators not knowing the facts.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says one in every 170 pregnancies in the United States end in stillbirth, and that Black women are twice as likely to experience one.  Push For Empowered Pregnancy is supporting these families in an effort to help lower these rates and give them equal birthing representation for family leave.

By age 30, fertility, the ability to get pregnant, begins to decline.  “This decline happens faster once you reach your mid-30s. By 45, fertility has declined so much that getting pregnant naturally is unlikely, Dr Mrs Hanson stated.  She recommended that all things being equal, women should give birth, “not too early or too late as they all have their respective complications.”  “Women should also consider proper spacing children,” she said and stressed that women should consider giving birth before their 30th birthday.  Dr Mrs Hansen said giving birth at a young age is better; nonetheless, the interval between children was crucial.  Dr Mrs Hanson made the remarks at the weekly “Your Health! Our Collective Responsibility,” a Ghana News Agency Tema Regional Office initiative aimed at promoting health-related communication and providing a platform for health information dissemination to influence personal health choices through improved health literacy.  The Tema Regional Office of the Ghana News Agency launched the public health advocacy platform “Your Health! Our Collective Responsibility” to examine the components of four health communication approaches: informing, instructing, persuading, and promoting.  She suggested that spacing the birth of children between the ages of two and four years is ideal when the body had recovered from the previous delivery and was ready for another.  She said the body reacted to giving birth as if it were the first time after a four-year interval.  The IMaH Medical Officer advised married couples to evaluate their financial and personal circumstances because some women had conditions that required them to limit births due to the high risk of mortality.  Dr Mrs Hanson recommended that young people marry early because giving birth early frequently allowed them to achieve the body stature, they desired and live life more fully.  Contributing to the discussion, Mr Samuel Atuahene Antwi, Nutritionist Officer at Tema Metropolitan Health Directorate, said the reproductive system of women in their younger years produces quality eggs.  He said women’s reproductive lifespan evolved within the menstrual cycle period; nevertheless, the fertility of eggs produced at ages 18 and up was of higher quality than eggs produced at ages 30 and up.  Mr Antwi also believed that giving birth at a young age was easier than giving birth at an older age when the woman and newborn were more likely to have abnormalities.  According to the Nutritionist, as individuals become older, they lose interest in many things. early parenthood stimulates young couples since they have the energy to take care of their children’s development.

Paatil was speaking at the inauguration of the Eklavya model resident school at Naswadi taluka in Chhota Udepur district. Four-time Congress MLA from Chhota Udepur, Dhiru Bhil, joined the BJP at the same event on Thursday.  Paatil, who also laid the foundation stone for a students’ hostel to come up in Pavi Jetpur taluka of the district, lauded the tribal community for “never having discriminated” between sons and daughters. He said, “Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Beti Bachao campaign began in Haryana and had to be taken all over the entire country to send the message across. But we can proudly say that in the tribal belt of Gujarat, we have not needed to launch this campaign at all. There are 107 girls for every 100 boys as per the ratio… there is no discrimination between sons and daughters in tribal communities.”  Without naming any community, he added, “If you have to take forward your community and society, it is essential to have a commensurate ratio of males and females but some communities that consider themselves progressive and prosperous have resorted to PNDT tests and not allowed the girl child to be born… But you tribals have never done this and so we appreciate you.”  Paatil took a potshot at the Congress, stating that the party “did not consider tribal leaders capable” of handling important portfolios. Narrating the life struggle of President Droupadi Murmu, Paatil said, “The Congress never thought of making a tribal the President of the country. It was Narendra Modi who wanted to honour the tribal communities… and he made a tribal woman the President… During the Congress rule, it was a tradition that tribal leaders only got forest tribal affairs portfolios, then it also took away the forest portfolio.”  “But the BJP believes that tribal leaders can also handle important portfolios. We had given Gandevi MLA Naresh Patel the important portfolio of food and civil supply and consumer protection and Kuber Dindor (who was present on the dias) holds the very important portfolio of education… Being a tribal leader, he has been able to efficiently handle the portfolio… Even during the teachers’ protests, Dindor was able to resolve the issue…”.  Paatil further said that the government is “looking at new innovations and technologies” to ensure that the benefits of government schemes in different sectors reach the people. “The Gujarat BJP has launched an app and ensured at all sarpanches have downloaded it… This app has details of the schemes and if anyone from the village wants to avail of the benefits, they can do so by approaching the sarpanch through the app and WhatsApp…”.  Advertisement  Speaking on the sides of the event after he joined the BJP with Congress district panchayat member Mahesh Bhil and several supporters, Dhiru Bhil said: “Is this development that there was no model school in this taluka for so many years? I discussed this matter with my supporters and they asked me this question too… Therefore, I thought it was the right step to join the party that is working for development, which will be seen on the ground and reach the people as it ought to.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9jaXRpZXMvYmFyb2RhL3NvbWUtcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmUtY29tbXVuaXRpZXMtZGlkbnQtYWxsb3ctYmlydGgtb2YtZ2lybC1jaGlsZC1wYWF0aWwtODYxNzI0OC_SAYEBaHR0cHM6Ly9pbmRpYW5leHByZXNzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2NpdGllcy9iYXJvZGEvc29tZS1wcm9ncmVzc2l2ZS1jb21tdW5pdGllcy1kaWRudC1hbGxvdy1iaXJ0aC1vZi1naXJsLWNoaWxkLXBhYXRpbC04NjE3MjQ4L2xpdGUv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

A UNICEF-funded milk bank in Poland set up for mothers in crisis came to the rescue of Evgeniya Loshkarova last September, giving Denis access to milk and his mother psychological support and lactation advice.  Loshkarova, who had been found unconscious by the police in her Warsaw apartment in her seventh month of pregnancy after a friend raised the alarm, said she was deeply grateful for the U.N.-backed milk bank in Poland - which has taken in hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians who fled Russia's invasion.  “It is such a great help both for the baby's health, and for the psychological comfort of the mother. When a baby is born prematurely, it is always very stressful, because something has gone wrong,” she said.  With the help of UNICEF’s programme, more than 300 mothers - about 20% of them from Ukraine - benefit every month from various services in 10 hospitals hosting milk banks in Poland.  “These are women who have difficulties in the initial stage of motherhood. They are under a lot of stress, some of them have suffered war trauma,"" said Aleksandra Wesolowska, head of the Human Milk Bank Foundation.  ""Therefore they really need lactation care and psychological support. This element of support is the most important. Milk from the bank is food, of course, but it is also the expression of female solidarity.”  Denis was probably nourished with the milk of Karolina Dabiak, 37, a former Polish health and safety worker who has donated to the milk bank since August 2022, two months after giving birth as she realised she was producing more milk than her infant son needed.  “What is the most important for me is helping the little people who come into this world in such difficult circumstances - premature babies,” Dabiak said.  Doctors in Ukraine advised Olena Liubimova, 36, to terminate her pregnancy because of uterine fibroids she had developed due to stress.  She gave birth prematurely after arriving in Poland, but Oleg came into the world ""on the verge of a miscarriage ... The doctors warned us the child might not survive and Olena's life was in danger"", husband Oleksandr Kyrnasivskyi said.  A milk bank in a hospital in Zielona Gora tube-fed Oleg with milk until Olena was able to breastfeed him. She has since benefited from the UNICEF programme's advanced perinatal care.

These are words no one ever wants to hear from a doctor. But they can be particularly painful for new parents or people who were eagerly expecting to be new parents. Learning your pregnancy is not viable or that your newborn has sustained an injury in-utero, during delivery, or shortly after birth can be one of the worst moments of a person's life.  Sometimes the medical provider will be able to explain what happened to cause this tragedy. Other times they will not know why an injury has occurred. In either case, unless an obvious and undeniable medical error has occurred, they will not offer any suggestion that they, other staff or the medical facility bear responsibility.  Doctors and other medical professionals are held in very high esteem by society. We trust them with our lives and overwhelmingly accept their advice and opinion when it comes to our health care. If a medical professional tells us they did everything they could, we want to believe them. But should we only accept their word for it?  In this blog, I explain the importance for the loved ones of a child who has sustained a birth injury to empower themselves in the search for answers about what happened. By allowing our deference to doctors to limit what we are able to learn about a tragic medical event, we may inadvertently lose opportunities to obtain support for our children and/or a sense of closure for ourselves.  The onus is on the parent/guardian.  Unless an adverse medical event meets specific criteria required for a hospital to launch an investigation into the matter, it is up to a patient and/or their loved ones to decide whether they want to search for answers or to seek a second opinion. When it comes to birth injuries, that search can lead in several directions.  If the child has survived, they will continue to receive medical care from the obstetrician (in the short-term), a pediatrician, family doctor, or other medical specialists or health care providers. These medical professionals may not be interested in searching for injury causation or it may be out of their area of experience. Instead, they will likely focus on treating the child's symptoms.  While they may not suggest to a parent or guardian that they should investigate the circumstances behind a birth injury, they are well placed to order testing or other evaluations that could prove to be missing pieces of the puzzle.  Self-advocacy is often necessary in these situations as these health care providers may be following routine guidelines and standards of care to determine when specific testing is warranted. You may need to make a case for how these orders could make a difference for your child's care. Unless medical malpractice is ruled out, you and your child may be missing out on an opportunity to obtain financial resources that could be used to support and enhance their care.  A personal injury lawyer can help.  If other medical providers are unable or unwilling to assist in your search for answers, a personal injury lawyer may be able to help you. When you contact a lawyer who handles birth injury cases, a preliminary review of your medical records and your child's medical records is often the first step in evaluating whether you may have an actionable case.  In consulting medical experts and reviewing the facts of a potential case, a personal injury lawyer can determine whether the proper standards of care were followed. If there was one or more breach in the standard of care, medical experts can then explain if this breach could have caused or contributed to the birth injury.  A breach in the standard of care - even if causation is established - is not enough to successfully sue for damages, however. A civil case against a medical provider must also demonstrate the breach was the result of negligent actions or inaction on the part of a person or institution providing care.  Not blaming, but understanding and empowering.  Whether you choose to look for answers about what caused your child's injury through medical practitioners, a personal injury lawyer, or both, it's important to remember that this search is not necessarily one that is looking to blame anyone for what happened.  Determining what caused your child's injury could be critical to the treatment they receive. For example, a newborn or young child may begin to present with symptoms that are marked as Cerebral Palsy - an incurable movement disorder caused by damage to the brain. Additional testing may indicate the child actually has a treatable form of dystonia - another type of movement disorder where symptoms can sometimes be reversible with prompt access to certain medications.  You may discover that your child's injury was the result of a genetic abnormality or a chromosomal issue. Learning this information could be critical to a parent's decision about whether to attempt future pregnancies. In other cases, a spontaneous medical event such as a placental abruption could have caused conditions where injury to the fetus occurs before a medical practitioner could reasonably intervene to prevent it. Knowing that you experienced this kind of medical condition is important information to communicate to an obstetrician during a future pregnancy as it may influence their recommendations for treatment.  Finally, if another person's actions did cause or contribute to the injury and you can establish that you may have an actionable claim, the damages you recover from a lawsuit could significantly improve your ability to provide top quality care for your child and to ensure they have the resources they need to live their best life.  Knowledge is power.  Parents, guardians and loved ones of children who have sustained birth injuries should be empowered to learn as much as possible about what happened to their child. Whether that knowledge is used to enhance their child's medical care, to inform decisions about fertility and family planning, to access financial resources, and/or to obtain a sense of closure after a tragic event, there is little to lose and much to gain by asking questions and looking for answers.  The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25kYXEuY29tL2NhbmFkYS9wZXJzb25hbC1pbmp1cnkvMTMxNjgyOC90aGVzZS10aGluZ3MtZG9udC1hbHdheXMtanVzdC1oYXBwZW4tZW1wb3dlcmluZy1wYXJlbnRzLW9mLWNoaWxkcmVuLXdpdGgtYmlydGgtaW5qdXJpZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

In the space of just 60 minutes, we meet best friends Isaac and Anna, each of whom is gay. They have both broken up with their respective partners. Seeking solace in the company of one another they embark on a booze-fuelled evening to forget about their heartbreak.  When Anna asks if Isaac would have sex with her if she were a man (he has sex with all his male friends!) what begins as a joke gradually morphs into something very real. This unexpected drunken one-night stand results in Anna becoming pregnant – something she never even considered a possibility. Starting as an expertly executed situation comedy, this soon opens into a far deeper play that examines parenthood, abortion and women’s rights.  The set is simple – a few wooden blocks, bottles of wine and various baby paraphernalia. The compact space at Barons Court Theatre places us right into the heart of the action much like flies on the wall. Indeed, it does feel as though we are witnessing some profoundly private moments between these two friends, so realistic is their connection with one another. Intimacy Director Monty Davis does a stellar job with the performers showcasing some of the most believable, tender, awkward and authentic sexual scenes you are likely to see on stage. It’s refreshing that Director Melissa Foulger refrains from cutting away or instigating black-outs during these moments.  It is also testament to the incredible chemistry between Autry and Kane. We believe in their friendship. We understand how they are both feeling as they dip their toes cautiously into uncharted waters. Crucially we immediately invest ourselves in them as people and the subsequent journeys they take. This is not only down to the assured, detailed and refined performances but the accessible, delightfully naturalistic dialogue that permeates throughout the succinct script.  As Isaac and Anna debate whether to keep the child – and it’s welcome to have a female character who doesn’t actually want to be a mother – we find ourselves siding with the arguments of both. We can feel Isaac’s excitement at the prospect of being a father while appreciating how conflicted Anna is. She wrestles with the question of when a foetus becomes a human life and despairs over the fact that a person has longer to return an Amazon item than they do to have an abortion. Given the Roe v. Wade controversy in The States, this aspect of the play feels timely and topical with the subject explored sensitively and openly.  The pace is well sustained for most of the production, although it occasionally falls flat for brief periods. Ultimately this is a well-balanced play which never preaches to its audience but rather allows them to form their own ideas with regard to abortion. There is a lot to unpack but we are left enlivened by this engaging and entertaining evening. Brimming with humour but with pertinent and expansive themes rippling through, At Birth is an accomplished piece of new writing deserving of future runs.

The Acting Head of Media and Publicity, Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission (ICRC), Mr. Ifeanyi Nwoko, said the project, to be funded by Messrs Barnksforte Technologies in partnership with the National Population Commission, had been approved.  The Federal Government also approved the establishment of an Aviation Leasing Company (ALC) under a Public Private Partnership (PPP).  According to the ICRC, the project seeks to capture and verify births and deaths in Nigeria and provide attestation and verification of certificates to end users on the platform.  Hitherto, birth and death registrations were done manually in Nigeria, causing low coverage and the processes were prone to errors, omissions, and delays, resulting in incomplete or inaccurate records.  The country has not been able to present a reliable data in birth and death rates which has affected policymaking and planning. According to the Commission, the proposed digital registration platform will eliminate the errors in the manual data collection and storage methods that made it difficult to aggregate and analyze birth and death statistics.  It was noted that lack of comprehensive and accurate data posed challenges for government agencies and organisations involved in vital statistics analysis, health planning, and resource allocation.  It was also noted that the manual processing of birth and death registrations was time consuming and inefficient, involving multiple entries, paperwork, and physical storage, leading to delays in issuing certificates and causing inconvenience for individuals requiring official documentation.  The concession agency also disclosed that the Federal Government approval of the establishment of an Aviation Leasing Company (ALC) under a Public Private Partnership (PPP) was in a bid to inject private sector funds into infrastructure development and boost the nation’s economic growth.  The commission said both approvals were given following the issuance of Full Business Case (FBC) compliance certificates by ICRC, the agency statutorily established to regulate PPPs.  The ICRC said the ALC, which would be executed by Messrs AJW Consortium as concessionaires, seeks to provide an opportunity for local leases of aircraft to both domestic and international carriers.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3dGVsZWdyYXBobmcuY29tL3N0YXRpc3RpY3MtZmctdG8tc3BlbmQtbjUtM2JuLW9uLWJpcnRoLWRlYXRoLWRhdGFiYXNlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Photograph: Matt Kavanagh  An eight-year-old boy who sued over the care he received at the time of his birth at Midland Regional Hospital Portlaoise has settled his High Court action with a €500,000 interim payment.  At five minutes of age, the High Court heard, the baby’s heartbeat plummeted and he needed resuscitation. There were nine different attempts at intubation that took one hour, the court was told.  The boy’s senior counsel Jeremy Maher said it was their case that during that time the baby was deprived of oxygen.  The Health Service Executive (HSE) has denied liability and a full defence was filed. However, counsel said, a breach of duty was admitted in relation to the failure to intubate.  READ MORE  Counsel said that was the limit of the concessions made and the case had settled after mediation with an interim payment for the next 10 years.  The boy cannot be identified by order of the court. In proceedings taken through his mother, he sued the HSE claiming he has been allegedly compromised as a result of the care he received at Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise, after his premature birth in March 2015.  It was claimed the successful intubation of the baby was allegedly delayed until one hour of life and there was an alleged failure to ensure the expeditious intubation of the baby following his arrival in the special care baby unit.  The baby, it was claimed, had been transferred to the unit without ensuring his intubation and adequate ventilation during the transfer, resulting in the baby being noted as gasping on arrival.  It was further claimed that the baby suffered an encephalopathy associated with asphyxia and he was transferred to a Dublin hospital.  Mr Maher told the court it was an extremely complex case which he said related to the birth and neonatal care in relation to the child and also the admission of the mother to the hospital.  He said it was not a case involving an intellectual disability, but it was their case the child had been compromised. Mr Maher, instructed by Cian O’Carroll Solicitors, said an expert on their side contended the collapse of the baby’s respiratory system caused the alleged injury.  He said it was also their case the baby had been delivered two hours later than he should have been and the mother was vomiting blood and should have got certain steroids on admission to hospital to protect the baby’s lungs.  These claims were denied by the HSE, which contended that all measures taken were appropriate.  Approving the interim payment, Mr Justice Paul Coffey said it was a very complicated case and he accepted the interim settlement was fair and reasonable in relation to the litigation risk involved.  The case will come back before the court in 10 years’ time when other matters such as loss of earnings will be assessed.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlyaXNodGltZXMuY29tL2NyaW1lLWxhdy9jb3VydHMvMjAyMy8wNS8xOC9ib3ktOC1zZXR0bGVzLWNhc2UtYWdhaW5zdC1oc2Utb3Zlci1iaXJ0aC13aXRoLTUwMDAwMC1pbnRlcmltLXBheW1lbnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Born on May 19, 1925, his life was marked by an unyielding commitment to racial equality and social justice.  Early Life  Malcolm Little, who would later adopt the name Malcolm X, was born in Omaha, Nebraska. His childhood was fraught with hardships and violence. His father, a Baptist preacher and supporter of Black nationalist leader Marcus Garvey, was allegedly killed by white supremacists. His mother was institutionalised for mental health issues, and Malcolm and his siblings were placed in foster care.  During his early life, Malcolm faced significant racial discrimination, which influenced his views on race and social inequality. In his teen years, he relocated to Boston and later Harlem in New York City, where he became involved in criminal activities.  Prison and Conversion  In 1946, Malcolm was sentenced to ten years in prison for larceny and breaking and entering. It was in prison where he began a transformative journey. He was introduced to the teachings of the Nation of Islam (NOI), a Black nationalist and religious movement, through his brother Reginald. He began to study the teachings of NOI leader Elijah Muhammad, which led to his conversion to Islam. It was also during this time that he adopted 'X' as his last name, a symbol for the African identity that he felt had been stolen from him and other African Americans due to slavery.  Rise to Prominence  Upon his release from prison in 1952, Malcolm X became a devoted follower and spokesperson for the NOI. His charisma, intelligence, and powerful oratory skills quickly propelled him into the national spotlight. He fiercely criticized the mainstream civil rights movement and its advocates, like Martin Luther King Jr., for their nonviolent approach, arguing instead for racial separatism and self-defense in the face of racial violence.  Malcolm X's philosophy evolved throughout his life. After a pilgrimage to Mecca in 1964, he became disillusioned with the NOI and its teachings. He embraced Sunni Islam and began to advocate for racial harmony, rather than separatism.  Assassination and Legacy  On February 21, 1965, Malcolm X was assassinated while giving a speech in Harlem. His killers were identified as members of the NOI. His assassination marked a tragic end to a life dedicated to challenging the status quo and fighting for the rights of African Americans.  Malcolm X's legacy continues to resonate today. He is often celebrated for his unapologetic critique of systemic racism, his powerful articulation of Black identity, and his advocacy for Black self-determination. His life and work continue to inspire and influence movements for racial and social justice across the globe.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8veW91cnN0b3J5LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1L21hbGNvbG0teC1iaXJ0aC1saWZlLWxlZ2FjeS0xOTI1LW1heS0xOdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

They have made:  28 hand-knitted and hand-crocheted baby blankets,  34 darling crocheted octopuses that are more than just plush toys, and,  15 hand-made incubator covers.    These items are for families of babies in neonatal intensive care units. OVR’s Field Services Team members always cross paths with birth registrars at hospitals. VDH staff train hospital staff on using software to register newborn births with the state properly.  “We have always been looking for an outreach program for our birthing facilities, said Senior Field Service Representative Denise Cox.  When Field Services Representative Lisa Cauthorne came across an article about the crocheted octopuses for preemies project, she shared it with her colleagues.  “We thought it was a great idea because a lot of us are crafters,” Cox said. “We were excited just to give back. In those (neonatal intensive care units), it’s pretty traumatic for many of the mothers… talking with the birth registrars gave us a boost to start this project.”  “We wanted to participate in something where we can help these children and these families that we affect. And I don’t mean from just a paper perspective, but from a personal perspective,” added Cauthorne. ”To show them we are not just governmental paper pushers.”  Former OVR staff member Michelle Reid, who has retired, came up with the name “Granny’s Closet.” They kicked the project into gear in August 2022. The blankets and octopuses are made to specifications. The octopuses have a purpose other than being cute – the idea is that the tentacles provide the babies something to grab onto so they don’t grab and dislodge any medical tubing that might be attached to them.  Meanwhile, Cauthorne reached out to area hospitals about donating the items. On May 10, they donated their first collection of hand-mades to the neonatal intensive care units at Bon Secours Southside Medical Center in Petersburg and to HCA Johnston-Willis Hospital in Chesterfield County.  They hoped to make Mother’s Day a little brighter for families with babies in the NICUs.  “We are already involved in these people’s lives through the registration of their birth certificate,” said OVR Director Seth Austin. “This is a way to drill down more of a tangible, personal way to help our staff connect with the work and people we are impacting every day.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZkaC52aXJnaW5pYS5nb3YvYmxvZy8yMDIzLzA1LzE4L29mZmljZS1vZi12aXRhbC1yZWNvcmRzLXN0YWZmLWtuaXQtYW5kLWNyb2NoZXQtY3VkZGxpZXMtZm9yLXByZWVtaWVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"birth","2023-07-25","Not Discerned","{""Boston"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}","Fri 19 May 2023 05:47:22","If you’re a woman, you can choose from several contraceptives. Birth control pills, intrauterine devices (IUDs), implants, injections, diaphragms and even the ‘morning after’ pill.  Yet there are still only two types of male contraception: condoms or a vasectomy. One isn’t always reliable or preferred and the other is generally permanent.  Surely we can make more contraceptives for men, right?  IT’S NOT FOR LACK OF TRYING  Scientists have been trying to create male contraceptives since at least the 1970s.  They first started clinical trials for hormonal contraceptives. The aim was to block sperm production by injecting either testosterone or a mix of testosterone and progestin into the body.  While these clinical studies had good success rates, they were often stopped after participants reported side effects such as acne, depression, changes in libido and weight gain.  Ironically, many women experience these side effects – or worse – when taking birth control.  Research on a segesterone acetate gel that is applied to the shoulders is still under way.  Non-hormonal approaches have included gene disruption technologies, the use of a Chinese herb that caused sperm deformation in mice and monkeys, as well as the use of a epididymal peptidase inhibitor, which blocks sperm functions in monkeys.  FRISKY BUSINESS  Scientists have faced many barriers in the creation of a male birth control.  Unpleasant side effects, limited funding interest and lengthy regulatory procedures, to name a few.  On top of that, hormonal and non-hormonal strategies require months of continuous treatment to be effective. And to be reversible, they need to be stopped months before sex occurs.  This means an ‘on-demand’ approach hasn’t been available – and that’s considered an unattractive option for men.  YOURS OR MINE?  Society’s gender perceptions also come into play here.  Historically, preventing pregnancy has been framed as a ‘women’s issue’. The reasoning goes that, if you can get pregnant, you’re responsible for preventing it.  Another outdated attitude is that it’s acceptable to manipulate female sex hormones but testosterone, the male sex hormone, is seen as the essence of ‘maleness’, fixed and unchanging, and determined by only innate factors.  EXCITING DEVELOPMENTS  Nonetheless, effective male birth control could now be in sight.  In 2023, there have been two promising studies which may provide non-hormonal, short-term and reversible options.  In February, an American study discovered the enzyme that makes sperm swim. Researchers then developed a compound that blocks this enzyme, rendering male mice temporarily infertile.  In April, American researchers identified the gene responsible for normal sperm production in the testicular tissue of mice, pigs, cattle and humans. Eliminating the gene in mice caused infertility by changing their sperm count, movement and shape.  While it’s still early days, these breakthroughs could revolutionise the current birth control landscape – and help level the playing field.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vcGFydGljbGUuc2NpdGVjaC5vcmcuYXUvaGVhbHRoL3BhcnRpY2xlLTEwMS1tYWxlLWJpcnRoLWNvbnRyb2wv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Now it has 1.3 million members. So the war has not stopped children from becoming members, nor has it stopped parents from allowing their children to become members. And I would say that the neo-pioneers are even more troubling because what they are learning is not just something for the Scouting movement. It's explicit preparation for a kind of identity that connects young people to this history of sacrifice and martyrdom with notions of orthodox morality and spirituality. And it's explicitly meant as a path to the military for young Russians, says Ian Garner, author of the book ""Z Generation: Into the Heart of Russia's Fascist Youth"".  TVP WEEKLY: It seems that your book will be very badly received by the Russians. Do you expect the name of Ian Garner to be blacklisted in Moscow?    IAN GARNER: Actually, I'm already blacklisted! I know I can't travel to Russia, and that's sad for me, of course, because I spent part of my youth in Russia, there are many great Russians, and the country isn't 100% bad. But the reality is that right now I just don't want to travel to Russia. Aside from the fact that I can't travel, there is a risk that I'll travel. We saw what happened to Evan Gershkovich (an American reporter arrested by the FSB on charges of espionage). But I don't want to be confronted with Russians either. I lost friends because of the war, people I've known for a very long time. I've lost people I respect, with whom I cannot even talk morally, except for research purposes, when they confess to the war.    You have called the state-sponsored neo-pioneer movement fascist. Is that an overused word? You know that in Europe we call anyone ""fascist"" who doesn't conform to the liberal way of thinking. So is the title ""Generation Z: Into the Heart of Russia's Fascist Youth"" also justified?    The main tenet of fascism, as I understand it, and I took this from Umberto Eco, the Italian philosopher, is the idea that peace can only be achieved through conflict. And that's particularly dangerous when it comes to Russia because of the country’s victim myth in which Russia sees itself as constantly under attack and constantly having to fight to make peace. So there is a fascist idea. The second point is a mixing of times and traditions. It's very easy to look at today's Russia and think: Well, many people are trying to restore the Soviet Union.    SIGN UP TO OUR PAGE Does Putin give this hope?    He has talked about the end of the Soviet Union as a great geopolitical catastrophe. But he's not trying to recreate the Soviet Union. He's trying to create something that combines elements of an idealized past, a past that isn't real. And that's past that contains parts of the Soviet Union, parts of the Tsarist Empire, and parts of a kind of medieval fantasy and folklore, folk tales about bogatyrs, right? All of that is supposed to be brought together, and that's the third point, you're struggling to create this utopian world where all the best of the past, of a past that of course isn't real, can be combined and somehow come true.

Obviously, with time and awareness, the perception is evolving, and more and more women are looking into effective methods of contraception like trusted birth control pills. But, because of this hush-hush nature, a lot of misconceptions, wrong information, and risks also tag along. Dr Yuvrajsingh Jadeja, M.D Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Nimaaya Centre For Women’s Health walks us through everything you need to know about birth control pills, how they work, and what to actually be wary of (instead of blindly following those birth control pill myths).  Here’s a mini history lesson for you! The pill was actually conceived in the 1950s and finally got FDA approval in the 60s—till date, it still stands as a popular form of birth control. “Birth control pills also known as combined oral contraceptive pills or popularly the pill are oral medicines that contain synthetic hormones, usually a combination of oestrogen and progestin,” Dr Jadeja explains. “These hormones prevent pregnancy by suppressing ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary) and thickening cervical mucus to make it more difficult for sperm to reach the egg. It also thins the uterine lining to some extent to prevent implantation.”  According to the expert, there are broadly three types of pills—the combination pill, the progestin-only pill, and the continuous-use pill. The three formulations vary in their chemical-hormonal composition, as well as their regimen for use. Thanks to its ability to regulate hormonal levels, most birth control pills aren’t just limited to controlling pregnancies and can also be applied to controlling PCOS, regulating menstruation, improving acne, treating endometriosis, and much more.  Note: Birth control pills are different from morning-after pills which are also known as emergency contraceptives. The latter works in a way where it delays or prevents ovulation or fertilisation, making it difficult for a fertilised egg to implant in the uterus.  Mistakes we make  Not consulting a healthcare professional  “Starting the pills without a thorough checkup and a healthcare provider’s consultation is one of the biggest mistakes one can make. There are many contraindications or cross-reactions of drugs that one needs to be aware of, before starting them.”  Skipping pills or not being consistent  “Birth control pills must be taken daily at the same time to be effective. Skipping pills or taking them at different times can increase the risk of pregnancy.”  Not starting on the right day  “Birth control pills should be started on the first 5 days of the menstrual cycle or as directed by a healthcare provider. Starting the pills at the wrong time can also increase the risk of pregnancy.”  Taking medication that can interfere  “Certain medications, such as antibiotics and anticonvulsants, can interfere with the effectiveness of birth control pills. It's important to discuss any new medications with a healthcare provider before taking them.”  Assuming you’re protected from STIs  “Birth control pills only protect against pregnancy, not sexually transmitted infections (STIs). It's important to use additional forms of protection, such as condoms, to reduce the risk of STIs.”  Ignoring the potential side effects  “Birth control pills can cause side effects, such as nausea, headaches, and mood changes. It's important to talk to a healthcare provider if any side effects persist or become severe.”  Side effects of incorrect usage  There’s nothing scary about birth control pills, only if taken in the right manner. Incorrect, unsupervised usage can impact the way your body behaves, which according to Dr Jadeja includes an increased risk of pregnancy and breakthrough bleeding. “The failure rate of BCPills is hardly 1 per cent if taken correctly, but if consumed incorrectly and inconsistently there is an increased risk of pregnancy,” he explains. “It can also cause breakthrough bleeding, which is light bleeding or spotting between periods. This can occur when hormone levels in the body are not consistent due to missed pills or incorrect timings.”  Safest way forward  Since birth control pills are still viewed as taboo in our society, they can lead to misinformation and incorrect usage. But, what’s more important according to Dr Jadeja is that there is resistance and reluctance to use this safe mode of contraception. “Awareness and education is the key because there are so many myths around contraception,” he says.  His advice would be to talk to a healthcare provider to determine the right birth control pill for you, keeping in mind the right dosage, usage, and possible side effects. Secondly, always use backup contraception, especially if you miss a pill or are taking antibiotics. Thirdly, make sure to attend regular check-ups to monitor potential side effects and ensure that the pills are working for you. And lastly, educate yourself about birth control pills and how they work, as this can help you make informed decisions.  “It's important to remember that birth control pills are a safe and effective form of contraception when used correctly. If you have any questions or concerns about birth control pills, talk to a healthcare provider for guidance,” he adds.

"birth","2023-05-12","Not Discerned","{""Rome"", ""Lazio"", ""Italy""}","Thu 18 May 2023 00:01:08","Relations between Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Pope Francis are generally regarded as rather tense. However, the two found common ground on the burning issue of Italy’s birth rate during the Stati generali della natalità (General State of Natality), which took place in Rome on Friday, May 12th.  The main point of friction between the two is immigration, with Meloni advocating firmness and control of borders and Pope Francis advocating pro-migrant positions. However, both agree on the issue of the birth rate crisis in Italy—a priority now shared by the entire Italian political class.  The question of birth rate is indeed particularly alarming for Italians, even more so than for their European neighbours. Between 2008 and 2022, births in Italy fell by 68%. If the decline in the Italian birth rate continues, there will soon be two deaths for every birth in Italy. In ten years, the country has lost 1.5 million people.  Based on an initiative by Gianluigi De Palo, head of the Foundation for Natality, this was the third edition of The General State of Natality. De Palo hopes to alert the population to the urgency of the situation. His wish is for Italy to, by 2030, return to the pre-2014 level of 500,000 births per year. In 2022, Italy recorded only 393,000 births.  In her speech, Giorgia Meloni recalled the first measures put in place by her government to try to halt the collapse. While her predecessor Mario Draghi is credited with introducing family allowances in 2021—which until then simply did not exist in Italy—Meloni highlighted the creation of a new ministry “for the family, birth rate and equal opportunities.” Tax incentives for families were also introduced. With some lyricism, Meloni reminded the audience that the love of Italy’s past greatness should drive the need to give her country a future, by starting families. The discourse of natality in Italy is always suspected of being associated with fascist ideology, which is why the Italian political class has difficulty appropriating it. For Meloni, the problem is not only financial but ideological. The family gets bad press, and it is, therefore, necessary to “reverse the trend” against the “dominant culture.” Motherhood and fatherhood should be “private choices” and “socially recognised values.”  This observation is shared by Pope Francis, who also denounced “a culture that is unfriendly, if not an enemy, of the family.” He is taking part in this conference for the second year running. This year, he emphatically condemned the reign of individualism and solitary enjoyment, which are in essence enemies of the family. “We cannot passively accept that so many young people find it so difficult to realise their dream of founding a family and settle for mediocre substitutes: making money, aiming for a career, travelling, jealously guarding their free time,” he exclaimed.  During his speech, Pope Francis told an anecdote that revealed his state of mind. He explained how a devout woman had asked him to “bless her baby.” He was surprised to discover that the “baby” in question was in fact … a small dog. Faced with this unexpected request, the Pontiff got carried away. “I didn’t have the patience, and I scolded the lady. Many children are hungry and she shows up with a dog!” he explained. He then lamented that many young Italians today, like that woman, prefer to surround themselves with pets rather than have children—a “habit of the future,” in his words, that tends to be widespread, and one that worries him deeply.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vZXVyb3BlYW5jb25zZXJ2YXRpdmUuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL25ld3MvbWVsb25pLWFuZC1wb3BlLWZyYW5jaXMtYWdyZWUtYmlydGgtcmF0ZS1tdXN0LWdyb3cv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

It’s not that I don’t trust Scorsese, but it doesn’t feel like it’s their story to tell. There are a number of successful projects these days highlighting the work of Native American artists and creators, so maybe it’s their story to tell. As much as Gann’s book is about the undercover agents sent by the nascent FBI to infiltrate the Oklahoma town where this series of deadly events occurred, it’s also about Mollie Burkhart, who witnessed her family and members of her Osage tribe being killed. When Leo is in a movie, the movie tends to revolve around him. I’m not particularly thrilled about the focus here. Nevertheless, damn, it looks like it’s going to keep my attention anyway.  It seems like Eric Roth and Scorsese’s screenplay took some lessons from last year’s Under The Banner Of Heaven, framing the events of the True Crime book around a narrative to give the story more color. I enjoyed Under The Banner Of Heaven. The concept for the series made it more appealing to audiences who may have otherwise skipped the book entirely. It would be great if Scorsese can do the same here, continuing the exploration of how Native Americans were treated after the age of Manifest Destiny.  Killers Of The Flower Moon stars Lily Gladstone, Tantoo Cardinal, Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro. Jesse Plemons, and Brendan Fraser. It will be in theaters on October 6.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhamliYS5jb20vZmlsbV9yZXZpZXdzL21hcnRpbi1zY29yc2VzZXMta2lsbGVycy1vZi10aGUtZmxvd2VyLW1vb24tdHJhaWxlci10cmFja3MtdGhlLWJpcnRoLW9mLXRoZS1mYmkucGhw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"birth","2022-05-15","Not Discerned","{""Singapore"", ""Singapore"", ""Singapore""}","Fri 19 May 2023 02:12:26","Similar to other Asian nations grappling with declining birth rates, Singapore experienced a record-low total birth rate of 1.05 in 2022, surpassing the previous records of 1.1 in 2020 and 1.12 in 2021.  On Tuesday, Professor Chong Yap Seng, the Dean of the National University of Singapore Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, elaborated on his visit to Korea and discussed Singapore's medical system during an interview with Korea Biomedical Review. (Courtesy of NUS)  Singapore's low birth rate remains a pressing demographic concern, posing challenges to its aging population and the sustainability of its economy.  Singapore's declining birth rate can be attributed to a confluence of factors, including rising affluence, shifting societal norms, and a competitive work culture.  The Singaporean government has implemented various measures to address this issue, including financial incentives, support for work-life balance, and efforts to promote marriage and parenthood.  In a notable development, Singapore has taken a step forward by permitting women, irrespective of marital status, to freeze their eggs for non-medical purposes, thereby preserving their fertility. This expansion in policy now allows women to freeze eggs for reasons beyond medical necessities, such as chemotherapy.  According to news reports, women aged between 21 and 35 can undergo elective egg freezing from late May.  However, the new regulations still have some strict rules when “using” the frozen eggs -- only legally married couples who want to try conception through in-vitro fertilization (IVF) can use the frozen eggs.  Still, Professor Chong Yap Seng, the Dean of the National University of Singapore Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine and an obstetrician-gynecologist specialist, believes that while it is not the most ideal method, it will help alleviate some of the low birth rate concerns. Professor Chong also serves as the Deputy Chief Executive of education and research at NUHS (National University Health System).  Professor Chong's recent visit to Korea aimed to foster collaboration in the field of infertility between Singaporean and Korean hospitals and facilitate student exchange between medical schools.  One of the main reasons for his trip to Korea was to visit CHA University to witness the hospital's fertility center in person.  ""CHA Hospital has an incredible fertility center setup,"" Chong said. ""They have been so successful in setting up their fertility center that I think they are one of the largest IVF businesses in the world.""  Chong went on to say that he was very impressed by how efficient and seamless everything was at CHA Hospital's fertility center during his visit on Tuesday.  ""Normally IVF can be a very stressful situation for women because they have to come regular every day for checkups and some of the processes can be really dehumanizing,"" Chong said. ""However, when I visited the CHA fertility center, I saw that it was so nicely set up people didn't seem stressed at all.""  The patients seemed very comfortable and natural in the surroundings, and this showed that CHA Hospital managed to scale things up while keeping it very personal with great service, he added.  The NUS Dean stressed that he was especially amazed by the fact that CHA Hospital conducts about 30,000 cycles of IVF annually.  ""In the context of IVF, it has been observed that around 50 to 60 percent of women who undergo the procedure successfully conceive and give birth to healthy babies,"" Chong said. ""As it typically takes about two to three cycles of treatment for a woman to reach that stage of a successful pregnancy, CHA's annual count of 30,000 cycles leads to approximately 15,000 cycles in successful conception and around 5,000 pregnancies and an equal number of births annually.""  Singapore records only 35,000 to 40,000 births each year, and if Singapore can adopt CHA's fertility know-how and add 5,000 pregnancies a year from IVF procedures, the country's birth rate could potentially increase by approximately 15 percent, Chong added.  Aside from visiting CHA Hospital, Chong also said that his visit to Korea includes renewing a memorandum of understanding between NUS and Yonsei University regarding student exchange and visiting Seoul National University Hospital's Digital Healthcare Center.  Korea's collaboration between industry and academia exceptional  When questioned about his choice of Korea as a collaboration partner, Chong elucidated that Korea's outstanding leadership in technology, particularly in areas like big data and artificial intelligence, and the synergy between industry and academia in leveraging and advancing these technologies were among the key factors that influenced his decision.  ""Everybody is now interested in AI and big data, and when I visited Seoul National University Hospital's new Digital Healthcare Center, it was very impressive,"" he said. ""The center was the pinnacle of collaboration between industry and academia, and this is something that we can learn from.""  NUS invests in training physician scientists  NUS has recently started allowing medical residents to work in wet labs during their working hours to train physician scientists, equipping them with the skills and knowledge to excel in both medical practice and research.  Professor Chong said that the program is just one of the schemes to train physician scientists, and the school offers various integrated curriculum that combines medical training with research immersion.  ""If you're a doctor, you see issues very differently from an ordinary researcher,"" Chong said. ""While a normal scientist might discover a technology or a research result that they believe will revolutionize the field, sometimes these discoveries may not apply to an actual clinical need or be very useful clinically.""  This is why having clinicians who can understand science is very important because they know what the actual healthcare need is, Chong added.  As the Deputy Chief Executive of NUHS, Chong emphasized his belief that research and education should not be limited to academia alone but should also focus on enhancing patient care.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvcmVhYmlvbWVkLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVWaWV3Lmh0bWw_aWR4bm89MjExNDjSAUBodHRwczovL3d3dy5rb3JlYWJpb21lZC5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlVmlld0FtcC5odG1sP2lkeG5vPTIxMTQ4?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Kate, who used hypnobirthing during her sons' births, said: ""It's a subconscious transformation of the mindset that doesn’t feature on all antenatal courses.  ""In hypnobirthing, we use it to let go of limiting beliefs for birth and therefore we're much more likely to feel emotionally safe on the day of giving birth.  ""Education about birth alone doesn’t go to those deeper layers of the mindset.""  One of the bonuses is it can shorten labour.  ""You'll learn about the importance of movement in labour - how to position yourself in the best way and to work with your body to release the right hormones,"" added Kate.  ""These are all things that contribute towards a more comfortable and shortened labour.""  There are benefits for the baby too.  Kate said: ""Pre-natal bonding is a big thing and due to the hypnobirthing practice going way beyond the course and into your home, it contributes towards your bonding experience.  ""When you’re pregnant your levels of stress impact your unborn baby so, the more relaxed you are, the lower the stress levels are.  ""A calmer mum leads to lower cortisol levels for baby too, enhancing the birth experience for babies as well as you.""  Kate added: ""Hypnobirthing changed how I viewed my life and what I wanted from it.  ""It focuses on thinking deeply about the way we talk to ourselves when we approach big things in life.

Janae Tisdale, a financial management technician of the 108th Wing Staff, and Staff Sgt. Shakeia Reyes, a personalist of the 108th Mission Support Group, have often passed one another in the hallways of the headquarters building. While pregnant at the same time, the two never in a million years expected to deliver their babies around the same date, in the same way, and be admitted to the same hospital.    “From start to finish, my son’s birth was a surprise,” said Reyes. “And the surprises just kept coming!”    On Friday, Dec. 30th, Reyes went to her last scheduled doctor’s appointment for a routine check-up. This would mark 40 weeks of pregnancy. Though routine, that morning her ‘water was leaking’ and her doctor was concerned.    “She wanted me to go to the hospital, so, I went,” said Reyes. “I was going to deliver at [Virtua Voorhees Hospital in New Jersey]. At the hospital, the doctor did a thorough screening, and test results concluded everything was ‘within normal limits’, so they sent me home. I arrived at Voorhees around 11 am and it was about 2 pm by this time.”    Reyes noted, that due to current pregnancy complications, she was told by her doctor that she could not go past 41 weeks in pregnancy. If so, the doctor would have to induce her labor by the end of the week.    “After leaving the hospital, my sister and I went to lunch,” said Reyes. “For the most part, I was relaxed, but in the back of my mind, I was nervous that the doctor would have to induce my labor.”    Around 11 pm, Reyes began to feel contractions but was not alarmed, she said, because earlier in the week she had experienced similar discomfort for short periods of time. As she and her sister left her in-law’s house to prepare for bed, she arrived home and immediately rushed to use the restroom!    “I was in the bathroom for nearly 17 minutes, when my water broke,” said Reyes. “My sister who was helping me at the time, noticed blood and was concerned for the baby, so I knew I had to head to the hospital.” It was around 1:30 am.    Now in the car, her husband, Jarvin, anxiously navigated the dark, empty roads toward Voorhees. “I was on the front passenger side, holding on the [grab handle],” said Reyes. “I couldn’t sit down, so I was in a standing position.”    With the hospital entrance in sight, Reyes was upright, sullied, and uncomfortable, but remained focused.    “I didn’t think about it,” recognized Reyes. “It just all happened! I was up in my seat. We pulled up to the hospital and Jarvin went to grab a wheelchair, a few feet away from our car. As I braced myself for one more contraction I unlocked my legs, and felt completely relieved. I had no idea why. So, I asked Jarvin to help me pull down my leggings, and simultaneously the baby came out onto the seat--on his side, not crying, in the fetal position, pale, and with no fluid.” It was about 2:07 am.    After poking the baby three times, still attached to her by the umbilical cord, Reyes said, she was in shock and began to panic.    Jarvin runs to get help and seizes the aid of a nearby security guard. The guard unaware of how to help, immediately puts on gloves and slaps the baby's bottom. Their new son begins to cry.    Four nurses rush to assist Reyes as she holds the baby to her chest, still attached. As they now look to the father to cut the cord, Jarvin was sitting exhausted on a nearby bench. “He was checked out,” Reyes laughed. “His nerves got the best of him.”    Because Jarvin was unavailable, Reyes decided to cut the cord herself. It was now Dec. 31st.    As if déjà vu, on January 4th, a healthy baby girl was born to Tisdale and beau, William Craig Kelly, in similar circumstances.    “I remember hearing something like that,” recalled Tisdale. “The nurses at the hospital mentioned, someone else [delivered] their baby in the car, not too long ago. It had to be her! It had to be Reyes...wow.”    At around 3:30 am, a few days after ushering in the New Year, Tisdale woke up with cramping in her back, she said. As the pain intensified, she tossed and turned for nearly two hours before deciding to get out of bed and take a warm shower.    “When I think about it, all the signs were there,” said Tisdale. “But I was focused on breathing and managing the pain.” The cramps were getting stronger.    Though unsure exactly when to head to the hospital, Tisdale says, she and Kelly began to prepare her toddler, Brooklynn, to stay with relatives.    “That’s when things kicked up a notch,” remembered Tisdale. “I wasn’t keeping track at the time, but I would say, the contractions were now coming ten to 15 mins apart.” It was about 6 am.    “His mom and my stepmom show up at the same time and I am throwing stuff in [my hospital bag and Brooklynn’s bag] intensely, bracing for contractions,” said Tisdale. “I couldn’t talk for four hours while this was happening. Craig gave me a hand fan, which was my saving grace.”    With a now packed car, Tisdale said, she was ready to head to the hospital. But with every two steps, she felt strong waves of pressure! She vomits.    Tisdale notes she was now in active labor. It was around 6:40 am.    “I used every towel in the house,” she joked. “As many videos as I have watched when I was [expecting], at the time, I was just focused on getting through the pain. It was chaos, but [luckily], I was breathing and not panicking.”    Kelly’s mom stayed behind but helped Tisdale into the back seat of the vehicle. With Kelly driving, he decided to take the back roads, as they did 19 months prior to prepare for the birth of their first child.    “We had the car seat installed,” said Tisdale. “So, I am leaning up against it with my legs stretched in front of me. I’m sliding all over the place, with another 5 minutes to go!”    At the last light, before pulling onto the hospital’s campus, Tisdale recognizes, the baby is coming.    “I didn’t want her in that position too long, so I just had to grin and bear it,” said Tisdale. “I started to feel like I had to push, so, I pulled down my pants to see if I could feel anything, and I felt her head. After a moment, I began to push, and she came out.”    Still attached by the umbilical cord, Tisdale puts the baby on her bare chest.    “I knew to do that because I [remembered I had to do] this for my first one,” said Tisdale. “Surprisingly, [I turned my head toward the dashboard clock] to look at the time. It was 8:10 am.”    Informed that the baby had arrived, Kelly was unsure if he should pull over or not, remembers Tisdale. But she urged him to “just go!” Kelly quickly pulls into the drop-off [section of the maternity ward] and runs in to get help. Several nurses rush out to greet them.    “Is everything ok?” asks Tisdale. “Just tell me everything looks normal?” The staff assures her everything is “okay”, and Kelly cuts the cord.    According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 80,000 American babies are born outside of hospitals each year. This is roughly just two percent of births in the United States. Of said births, about 94 percent occur in a home or birthing center, which results in nearly six percent of U.S. mothers delivering their babies in a car—an uncommon feat, nothing short of miraculous!    Though Reyes displayed her own strength that day, she noted that what Tisdale accomplished was amazing.    “As I think about her story, I don’t know how she did it,” said Reyes.    “When the doctor examined me, I only had a small tear,” said Tisdale. “This was a big deal because I had a cesarean (or C-section) with my first child, and this birth was natural.”    No different from Reyes, Tisdale expressed that delivering her daughter that day was a relief because she too desired to have her baby without surgery. “Funny, the day I delivered, was the day I was going to find out if I would need a C-section. I chose my doctor because she was super supportive of my wishes to have a natural birth.”    Thinking back, Tisdale recognized that because she was in labor for 36 hours with her first daughter, she misread the signs leading up to the birth of her second child.    “They say, ‘no two pregnancies are the same’,” said Tisdale. “Brooklynn was born in 2021 at the height of [the pandemic]. Labor with her was more difficult than with the second. And the C-section was a last-minute decision by my doctor because my ‘water broke’.”    Reyes who has two other children, both girls, noted that the birth of her son was also different from the others. Still, his birth remarkably aligned with Tisdale’s delivery, just a couple of days apart.    “That’s super unique,” responded Tisdale. “We’re both in the military—what are the odds—with babies born so close together. Maybe it was something in the stars.”    To date, both Reyes and Tisdale have healthy babies and have recovered well.    “Childbirth is by far the hardest thing I have ever done,” affirms Tisdale. “It is harder than the military!”    And so, it was.    With both mothers working full-time on base, the two concurred that their units have been supportive of their needs throughout their pregnancy, specifically in terms of reasonable maternity leave.    “But some people don’t have that experience,” continues Tisdale.    Fortunately, in recent years, several 108th Wing female leaders have made tremendous headway in assuring new moms have what is needed to work and best serve their children.    Currently, an initiative, carried out by a team from the Wing’s Diversity and Inclusion Council, is identifying rooms conducive to lactation in several locations throughout the wing. This will allow our nursing mothers a comfortable and private location where they can easily pump milk during the workday.    As their delivery stories end, the only thing left to unveil is the name of each child.    “We named our daughter, Chase Nalani Kelly,” said Tisdale.    “And I chose the name, Christian Alexander Reyes,” said Reyes, revealing that her son’s initials intentionally spelled out CAR. “This is so, he will always know the story of how he was born.”  NEWS INFO Date Taken: 05.19.2023 Date Posted: 05.18.2023 15:23 Story ID: 445041 Location: JOINT BASE MCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURST, NJ, US Web Views: 179 Downloads: 0 PUBLIC DOMAIN This work, Two mothers, two cars, two births, by SSgt Andrea Williamson, identified by DVIDS, must comply with the restrictions shown on https://www.dvidshub.net/about/copyright.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR2aWRzaHViLm5ldC9uZXdzLzQ0NTA0MS90d28tbW90aGVycy10d28tY2Fycy10d28tYmlydGhz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"birth","2023-10-01","Not Discerned","{""Rochester"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 00:49:00","Since ancient times, there have been speculations on how the season of birth might influence a person’s health and destiny. Ancient astrologers believed that zodiac signs, which are based on the month of birth, had a profound impact on a person’s temperament, personality, and fate. But in the light of modern science, could there be any truth to these claims?  Recent scientific studies suggest that there might be some correlations between the month of birth and health outcomes. However, it is important to approach these findings with an understanding that they do not amount to destiny.  The Science Behind the Season  One of the key factors that varies by birth season is exposure to sunlight, and subsequently, vitamin D levels. Vitamin D, synthesized by our bodies in response to sunlight, is essential for bone health and immune function. Hence, babies born in winter might have lower vitamin D levels compared to those born in summer, which could potentially influence health outcomes.  Correlations and Health Implications  A study published in the Journal of American Medical Informatics Association reported links between birth month and risk of disease later in life. The study analyzed health data of more than 10 million people and found 55 diseases that were significantly correlated with birth month. For example, people born in October and November were found to have a higher risk of respiratory illnesses, while those born in late winter or early spring had a slightly increased risk of neurological disorders.  Another study published in the journal Heliyon showed that people born in the autumn were more likely to suffer from depression, while those born in spring were at a higher risk of anxiety disorders. Again, these associations are thought to be linked to varying levels of sunlight exposure during pregnancy and immediately after birth.  Birth Season and Body Clocks  The season of birth might also influence our body clocks or circadian rhythms. Research published in Nature Neuroscience showed that people born in the winter months tend to have a more morning-oriented circadian rhythm, while those born in the summer tend to be more evening-oriented. This could potentially impact sleep patterns, mental health, and susceptibility to certain diseases.  A Word of Caution  While these findings are intriguing, it’s essential to stress that the correlations are not causal relationships. Many other factors, such as genetics, lifestyle, and environment, play a far more significant role in determining health outcomes. The month or season of birth is just one small piece of a much larger, complex puzzle.  Moreover, the studies often reflect averages across large populations and don’t apply to every individual. So while these patterns are interesting, they should not be a cause for alarm or reassurance. Every individual is unique, and a multitude of factors contribute to one’s health beyond the month they were born in.  There’s a fascinating interplay between the time of our birth and our health, but it’s a subtle one, full of nuances and influenced by a host of other factors. Research in this area is ongoing and continually deepening our understanding of how our birth month influences us. While it’s intriguing to think that the time of year we are born might shape us, it’s clear that it is just one factor among many that determines our health.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcmFnZW5ld3MuY29tL2hpZGRlbi1saW5rLWJldHdlZW4teW91ci1iaXJ0aC1tb250aC1hbmQteW91ci0xMDA5MDQ3L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

So how was it filming on location in Korea?  Korea is so amazing. If you had not been to Korea, you need to go like next week because there is so much to do. And I don't think for even one second when we weren't filming, like we would always be hanging out, whether that was in the hotel together or we'd go exploring. And because we also filmed not just in Seoul but a whole bunch of different locations around. So it really gave us a good sense of the city, the community, the culture as well. It's just such an incredible place to be just for food and and things to do every day. So I would highly recommend you go.  Your character in the show is searching for his birth family. And interestingly, you're also searching for your birth family in real life. So could you tell us the story behind that?  So I'm an adopted Korean. I was adopted at six months by my two beautiful parents. And basically I didn't think much of it until I was 19, when I had a very early quarter life crisis, as I think most young adolescents have somewhat of their identity and not really knowing what they want to do. But kind of as that feeling grew, I really was this I was this close to just booking a flight to Korea, going and trying to find my mother. The big issue with this situation is that I really don't know much about her at all. I know that she was very young and that I hope it brought her a little bit more stability, maybe giving me away. But I didn't get left with a lost name. So I know my Korean names for your child. But Kim, which is on my birth certificate, apparently is not the actual last name that I would have had. So of course, that makes it incredibly hard to track down ancestry tests, especially in the U.S. and Australia. You know, they don't go down into like the genetic level of especially somewhere in Asia. They tend to just be like, Oh, you are from Asia. And I'm like, Yes, I knew that. And that makes everything a little more difficult, of course. But I think as the as I was working on Katie and being back in Korea, that started to kind of spur a little bit more passion to be like, oh, you know. I'm not actively looking right now because I feel like in my own life, I, my parents, my adoptive parents have been so fantastic in raising me in Australia. But like I said, it's it's starting to kind of. Like there's a small little light that's beginning to shine that I might want to start search again and look a lot more seriously this time.

Minister Without Portfolio in the Office of the Prime Minister, Floyd Green, announced on Tuesday that the Registrar General’s Department (RGD) is taking steps to print birth certificates in braille for persons who are blind.  He said that the plan would be executed through partnerships with the Jamaica Council for Persons with Disabilities (JCPD), the Jamaica Society for the Blind, and other relevant stakeholders.  According to Green, this move represents a pioneering effort within the English-speaking Caribbean.  In a wide-ranging contribution to the Sectoral Debate in Gordon House on Tuesday, Green also signalled the Government’s plans to introduce online will drafting and recording through the Administrator General’s Department.  Headlines Delivered to Your Inbox Sign up for The Gleaner’s morning and evening newsletters.  He noted that a number of Jamaicans had died with assets, especially land, but never prepared a will.  In his recent contribution to the Sectoral Debate in Parliament, Justice Minister Delroy Chuck pointed out that the Administrator General’s Department was managing properties worth $50 billion as persons had died without a will and there were lengthy family disputes over how the estates should be shared.  Green also announced that starting in September, the RGD would be rolling out its online application for first free birth certificates. With approximately 36,000 births per year, Green said that more than 30,000 mothers can make an application from the comfort of their homes.  Turning to the National Identification System (NIDS) project, Green said that the Government was at an advanced stage in the procurement process to select a vendor to implement a civil registration solution to manage the end-to-end registration and issuance of birth, marriage, deed poll, and death records at the RGD.  “The Government, therefore, intends to enter into a contract with the successful vendor in this financial year to advance the project once the ongoing competitive procurement process is completed. Once this project is completed, Jamaicans will experience quicker and more efficient services,” he said.  With plans to roll out NIDS over the next six months, Green said the Government would go to tender to select contractors to start the modification of an additional 19 post offices to expand access to the national identification card.  “We are presently finishing the enrolment centre at the Post Office Mall in Liguanea and will break ground for Mona and Constant Spring. We will be utilising the space at our post offices to create modern, state-of-the art enrolment facilities,” he said.  edmond.campbell@gleanerjm.com","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vamFtYWljYS1nbGVhbmVyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ld3MvMjAyMzA1MTkvYnJhaWxsZS1iaXJ0aC1jZXJ0aWZpY2F0ZXMtY29taW5nLXZpc3VhbGx5LWltcGFpcmVk0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"birth","2023-05-18","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 09:15:00","Farming is full of surprises.  Sometimes it’s weather popping up when not expected that damages your crops or your ability to harvest them. Sometimes, it’s a broken sheer pin, a busted hydraulic line or a flat tire on a piece of equipment you need to be using. Sometimes, it is a call from a neighbor while you’re 40 minutes away that your cows are walking through the neighborhood, and at last sighting, are a half mile from home. (This last one happened to us in January.)  Not all farming surprises are negative, though. Sometimes you find a double yolk in an egg. Sometimes, pumpkin seeds sprout an unexpected vine where a spoiled pumpkin was tossed out the year before. And sometimes, it’s a miniature calf, born from a heifer you didn’t know had been bred.  That happened to us last week.  If you recall when I wrote last, I was expecting two more calves. That went down to one when the cow we lovingly refer to as “Hippo” — due to her shape when pregnant — gave birth to a healthy bull. The bull’s arrival was met with gratitude, despite completely busting my “final four” bracket by confirming I had predicted none of the last four calves in the proper birth order.  Waiting for the last calf is a real challenge. So, I was quite excited last week when my son announced a new calf had been born. The excitement turned to worry when he told me it was much smaller than any calf he had ever seen.  My immediate assumption was he had seen one half of a pair of twins. If he had only seen one, the cow mom may have abandoned the other one, was still in labor, or was having other challenges. We immediately went to assess the situation.  When we walked in with the herd, we saw the new calf walking up the hill. It was tiny. It seemed to have good mobility, but also seemed to be walking away from the presumed mother. It was then I noticed one of the heifers I kept from the previous year’s batch was walking beside the little guy. Another moment of observation confirmed she was the mother. Although how that could be the case, I couldn’t figure out, since I never had her near a bull since she was 6 months old. It was later determined she had been bred before weaning, at only 4 months old. That was definitely a surprise.  I had to table that concern for the moment and make sure the new mom and baby were both OK.  We decided to put the pair into our birthing shed until we knew the little one was going to be able to nurse. I walked up to it, scooped it up, and made sure the mother knew where we were going. I confirmed he was a bull and began to assess his condition as we walked toward the pen. He was the smallest calf I have ever seen. He was the lightest calf I have ever carried. My best guess is that he weighed between 20 and 25 pounds.  We locked mom and baby in the pen and brought some hay for him to lie on, some second cut for mom to eat, and some grain and water for her as well. Mom’s milk didn’t seem to have come in yet, so we mixed up a small amount of colostrum and fed it to the calf. He gulped it down without fighting the bottle, which was another surprise.  We gave another feeding for mom and baby the next morning, and a third that evening. This time, the mini (that I’d begun calling Tiny Tim) fought the bottle a bit and only drank half of what I prepared. Mom’s udder still seemed empty to me, so I was more concerned. Still, that afternoon, Tim remained alert, able to stand on his own. The inside of his mouth was also the right temperature. Particularly at his size, any substantial amount of time without milk would have meant almost certain death.  After one more day inside the pen with zero intervention from us, we decided to turn them back outside. It was supposed to be warm and dry for the next few days and it seemed like the right decision. It’s always best for mom to have constant access to food and water.  I was still concerned about her milk supply, however, so I called our vet to come check them out. Tim was kind enough to eliminate his bladder and bowels in front of the vet, so she was able to confirm that the little guy is perfectly intact, not premature, and fully functional. The vet also said as his needs increase, so should mom’s supply.  The vet also checked out the new mama’s sister and confirmed she also appears to be pregnant and due any day. Another surprise.  Still, the last big cow had her baby this week, so now this must be it. She’s the last female on the property that hasn’t had a baby this year. After this, the surprises will have to come from somewhere else for a while. I hope they are still of the good variety, but what I know is they’ll be hard-pressed to be as adorable as this one.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sYW5jYXN0ZXJmYXJtaW5nLmNvbS9jb3VudHJ5LWxpZmUvZmFtaWx5L2FuLXVuZXhwZWN0ZWQtY2FsZi1iaXJ0aC1rZWVwcy1mYXJtZXItb24taGVyLXRvZXMvYXJ0aWNsZV9lNzc2ZGNjYy1kZmEwLTU1MmItYWZiNi1lZWM1YWE2OWYxNjQuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Christina Bradley never gave up hope — even when he told her, “leave me alone and let me die.”  So when Dan Bradley called her from Florida in 2019 to tell her that he was sober and “ready,” Christina Bradley eagerly moved down with their kids to start a new life with him in Vero Beach. She said she had never stopped believing that they would be a family again.  “Even when I was so angry at him, I was like, ‘I love this guy,”’ Christina Bradley told Hearst Connecticut Media during an interview from her Florida home, where she is due to give birth to a son, Logan, next week.  Christina Bradley / contributed photo  But six weeks ago her and her children’s lives were shattered when Dan Bradley died suddenly at 44.  “On April 5, I went into preterm labor at eight months with our sixth child, and Dan left work to be by my side. I was admitted to labor and delivery for observation, and we talked all night and into the morning, until our (obstetrician) came in and told us to get some sleep as it was 3:30 in the morning,” Christina Bradley said. “I watched him lay down on the dad’s cot right next to my bed and scroll through TikTok, and soon I closed my eyes.”  At 7 a.m., when Dan Bradley’s alarm went off and he didn’t wake up, Christina Bradley understood something was wrong.  “I got a horrible feeling. I ripped out all my leads and I went right to him and I checked for carotid pulse … nothing,” she said. “I checked for breath sounds and watched for a rise and fall of his chest … nothing.”  Using her EMT training, she “immediately started CPR and was screaming for a nurse.”  “Six courses of medications in attempt of resuscitation couldn’t bring him back,” she said. “He was my everything.”  Although the medical examiner said it will be June before an official cause of death can be released for the Stamford native, Christina Bradley suspects it was a pulmonary embolism, or maybe the cancer that was removed from his kidney in 2022 came back and “perhaps he kept (it) from us all.”  Regardless of the cause, Dan Bradley’s death is a loss to more than Christina Bradley and her children, she said.  “He wasn’t just my everything — he was important to a lot of people, and I don’t want his memory to be forgotten,” she said. “I want to keep his life shining.”  Kim Kelly Hahn, a former co-worker, agreed.  “He was my partner on the Westchester Stat Team,” said Hahn of her time working with Dan Bradley from 2009 to 2011. “He was a critical care pediatric medic, and he had an infectious personality.

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:  Credit: Pixabay/CC0 Public Domain  Researchers have identified various genes whose expression in the brain before birth may affect the risk of developing a range of mental illnesses during childhood. The team, which was led by investigators at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), a founding member of Mass General Brigham (MGB), published their findings recently in Nature Neuroscience.  Using data from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, a federally funded study of child and adolescent brain development that has enrolled nearly 12,000 individuals at age 9–10 years, the group first assessed whether genetic patterns that have been associated with psychiatric illnesses in adults also tracked with psychiatric symptoms in children.  ""We found those relationships to be more complex than we had imagined. For example, genetic risk for ADHD and depression were associated with a range of symptoms in children, not just those related to attention or mood,"" says co–senior author Joshua Roffman, MD, director of MGH's Early Brain Development Initiative. ""The genetic factors that shape mental illness symptoms in kids differ from the ones that shape mental illness symptoms in adults.""  The strongest genetic predictor for most mental health symptoms in ABCD participants was a new measure, developed by co–senior author and computational geneticist Phil H. Lee, Ph.D., and colleagues at the Mass General Center for Genomic Medicine, that indexes risk not for a single disorder, but rather for a constellation of developmental disorders. The scientists refer to this new genetic measure as a ""neurodevelopmental gene set,"" as it combines elements of genetic risk for several neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism, ADHD, Tourette syndrome, and depression.  Roffman, Lee, and their international collaborators found that this neurodevelopmental gene set also predicted childhood psychiatric symptoms in participants of the Generation R study, which included children of a similar age in the Netherlands.  Additional analyses of information from brain banks revealed that the genes in this set are expressed most strongly in the brain's cerebellum (which is most known for its involvement in complex motor functions), and their expression in the cerebellum peaks before birth. Also, brain imaging data from the ABCD study indicated that children with psychiatric symptoms tended to have a slightly smaller cerebellum, perhaps a reflection of these genes' effects on cerebellar development during prenatal life.  ""That genetic risk factors for mental illness in kids begin to influence the brain so early on—even before birth—means that interventions that protect them from risk may also need to start earlier in life than previously expected,"" says Roffman. ""It is also important to note that while genes play an important part in risk for mental illness, the early life environment is also critical—and at this point, potentially easier to modify.""  Indeed, certain prenatal exposures—such as folic acid—show promise for better brain health outcomes in children. ""Our research team at Mass General is searching for other factors during pregnancy—whether in the realm of healthy lifestyle (such as quality sleep, exercise, and diet), optimal prenatal care, or psychosocial support—that can confer resiliency in developing brains and protect against risk of psychiatric disorders in young people.""  One study, called Brain health Begins Before Birth (B4), is actively enrolling families at MGH during pregnancy and following brain development in children after birth.

VTDigger strives to publish a variety of views from a broad range of Vermonters. Commentaries give voice to community members and do not represent VTDigger’s views. To submit a commentary, follow the instructions here.  This commentary is by Lee Russ of Bennington, a retired legal editor who was the lead editor/author of both the third edition of “Couch on Insurance” and the Attorneys Medical Advisor.  As any conservative will tell you repeatedly, poor decision-making is the real root cause of poverty.  Since where you live, which schools you attend, and parental wealth and education are the most significant factors that determine a person’s lifetime income and general economic status, the responsibility of individuals must begin before birth.  Obviously people who inherit vast fortunes, and those who grow up in homes where money and education are both valued and easily available, deserve their prosperity, since they made astute pre-birth decisions. In short, they have vastly superior talents as parent selectors.  The poor, who lacked these parental selection skills, need to accept the consequences of their poor decision-making in the crucial period before they were conceived and while they were in utero.  That doesn’t mean that those of us who enjoy the fruits of good pre-birth judgment can’t lend the poor a hand. To that end, the scientific community has begun careful study of what it is calling ""Pre-Birth Judgment"" or PBJ. Those who make poor PBJs are considered to suffer from ""Pre-Birth Misjudgment Syndrome"" or PBMS.  Funded by several billionaires who wish to remain anonymous, the Crazy Yet Lucrative Uses of Reason Project (CYLURP) has partnered with the National Society of Erroneous Economists (NatSEE) and the National Association of Deluded Psychologists and Psychiatrists (NAD-PAP) to formulate a set of diagnostic criteria that will allow PBMS to be added to the next edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), the bible for diagnosing mental disorder.  To date, the project has identified the following criteria for diagnosing PBMS:  Lack of economic resources  Major periods of anxiety over lack of resources  Bouts of anger that often cause sleep difficulties and occasionally produce angry outbursts  Poor health, especially hypertension, obesity, cirrhosis  Depressive mood marked by prolonged bouts of hopelessness.  The long-term prognosis for some 95% of PBMS sufferers can be stated simply as ""SCREWED.""  The project has a way to go, yet, but is making progress. Researchers are already on the verge of establishing that their working hypothesis can't be definitively disproved. Several other projects are already underway.  Lead researcher Pietr Piper-Picking last month announced a long-term study that will compare PBMS sufferers to those who have demonstrated superior PBJ skills. The study hopes to elucidate whether good PBJ of offspring can be predicted by the pre-birth judgment of parents.  “We suspect,” Piper-Picking said in a prepared statement, “that there will be a significant genetic component to PBJ. If so, I fear there is little that can be done to improve the pre-birth judgment of those who choose parents of limited resources and education.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vdnRkaWdnZXIub3JnLzIwMjMvMDUvMTgvbGVlLXJ1c3MtcHJlLWJpcnRoLW1pc2p1ZGdtZW50LXN5bmRyb21lLWFuZC10aGUtaXJyZXNwb25zaWJsZS1wb29yL9IBZ2h0dHBzOi8vdnRkaWdnZXIub3JnLzIwMjMvMDUvMTgvbGVlLXJ1c3MtcHJlLWJpcnRoLW1pc2p1ZGdtZW50LXN5bmRyb21lLWFuZC10aGUtaXJyZXNwb25zaWJsZS1wb29yL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The government in March laid out a plan to boost child care over the coming three years, but the issue of financing the major spending package, such as tax hikes or debt issues, has been unresolved.  Under the planned financing scheme, Jiji reported, the government would expand the size of the funds gradually over the three years from fiscal 2024/25 and secure the necessary amount by the end of the policy period.  Kishida has said the government will identify the funds for the childcare policy by June and he was not planning to hike consumer sales taxes to that end.  Government officials could not be reached for comment outside of business hours. Jiji is one of the two major domestic news agencies in Japan with a track record of scoops.  Some ruling party lawmakers have floated the idea of issuing extra bonds, with the justification that education-purposed bonds should help future generations, while the government is struggling to come up with permanent sources of secure revenue.  Kishida has announced a plan to boost childcare support, following another big spending plan to double a national military outlay. These plans would strain Japan's already dire public debt, which is over twice the size of annual economic output.  The government earmarked around 6.1 trillion yen for the last fiscal year ended in March to arrest the decline in the number of births.  Japan is among the world's fastest ageing societies, with the annual number of newborns falling below 800,000 for the first time, having previously peaked at 2.09 million in 1973 during the second baby boom.  The declining birth trend has been blamed for a worsening labour shortage and reduced long-term economic growth potential.

Conception must occur before birth can happen. The powerful metaphor Jesus uses to describe the experience his disciples need to endure to become the church is deeply instructive for us as we await Pentecost.  The full story of our conversion includes the time of questioning and longing that brings us into relationship with God. Our consent is necessary to make this encounter in faith a love story. Within that love story we open ourselves to receive the gift of divine life that begins in us like a loving conception. The Word of God may come to us in crisis, like a cry in the night, or gradually as a whisper. What God initiates is ours to nourish by prayer, and it grows in stages as we respond. Like gestation, the Christ in us takes form in the womb of our consciousness, becoming our identity and the organizing principle of all our values and sense of purpose.  No mature faith occurs without struggle. What love begins comes to birth in labor, our need to choose and commit ourselves to one path over others, find and obey our authentic selves before God by relinquishing every false promise or compromise. Vocation supersedes career as discipleship takes precedence in our lives and our goals.  What we experience personally and individually is a parable of the collective responses that make us the church. The Holy Spirit sings the same new song in every believer, uniting them to be the body of Christ in the world. This does not happen without our free, conscious participation, including a life of prayer and the sacraments. What child grows without nourishment? So, a serious Christian needs the Eucharist in all its implications, especially for the full use of our gifts within community.  What human person reaches maturity without discipline and socialization to learn virtue and responsibility? So, every mature Christian grows up by sharing with others the burdens of justice and service, a life for others and habits of awareness and compassion, integrity and steadfastness, openness and truthfulness.  How tragic it would be to spend our lives without becoming ourselves, the persons God called us to be from the beginning. What joy there would be if whole communities became the presence of Christ in a parish, a neighborhood, a society and a nation. Isn't this why we were born, both as human beings and as the children of God?","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5jcm9ubGluZS5vcmcvc3Bpcml0dWFsaXR5L3BlbmNpbC1wcmVhY2hpbmcvY29uY2VwdGlvbi1iaXJ0aNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Somehow, after a battle with pneumonia, the birth of his second child and a pair of flights to the other side of the world and back, Fox is in tremendous position after his opening round at the second major championship of the year.  Fox posted a 2-under 68 on Thursday to kick off the PGA Championship, which put him one shot back of the leaders at Oak Hill Country Club in Rochester, New York.  “It’s probably pretty surprising, as I didn’t have a lot of prep coming in and had four weeks off in the lead-up to this with a few things going on,” Fox said.  Fox falls ill at the Masters  Fox’s wild month started at the Masters.  While he made it through and finished T26 in his first run at Augusta National, Fox struggled throughout the weekend. He started getting sick and withdrew from the RBC Heritage the next week in the middle of the first round.  He then flew more than 8,200 miles back home to Auckland, New Zealand, and learned that he had pneumonia. It didn’t stop there. A few weeks later, Fox’s second child was born.  “That took a fair while on antibiotics to get over that,” Fox said. “Basically as soon as I got over that, our daughter was born, which was just over two weeks ago now. Our second daughter was born, Margot. So I had a few sleepless nights and not a lot of practice.”  It wasn’t until Sunday that Fox took the 15.5-hour flight from Auckland to Chicago. He made the last leg of the trip Monday morning.  While he’s healthy again, the combination of battling pneumonia and caring for a newborn took a toll on the 36-year-old.  “To be honest, I still don’t feel like I’ve got [my strength] back completely,” Fox said. “My speed is down a little bit on what it normally is.  “Probably took two weeks at home just to get any energy back. I would go do something with my daughter and then feel like I could sit on the couch all afternoon, which I guess is not a bad thing anyway.”  Ryan Fox barely played any golf over the past month while recovering from pneumonia and welcoming his new daughter, Margot. (David Cannon/Getty Images)  Fox shines in opening round  Although he played just a little bit of golf between Augusta National and now, it didn’t look like it Thursday.  Fox’s opening round was very solid. He finished with a 2-under 68 on Thursday and carded four birdies with a pair of bogeys to enter the clubhouse T2. His mistakes were minimal. He bogeyed the par-3 fifth after hitting his tee shot in the bunker and hit his approach shot into a fairway bunker before settling for another bogey at the par-4 17th.  “Well, the golf game was pretty good a month ago. It can't have disappeared that far,” Fox said. “As I said, I needed a break. I think I played — I had been away for 11 of 13 weeks at the start of the year. Yeah, almost pneumonia was a benefit in a way that I just got home and knew I could do nothing and just relax. Yeah, coming in this week fresh has been pretty good so far.”  Fox has yet to win on the PGA Tour, but he has seven international wins to his name — most recently at the DP World Tour’s Ras al Khaimah Classic in December. His best finish at a major came at the British Open in 2019, where he finished T16. Fox made the cut at the PGA Championship last year but finished 54th at 7-over on the week.  He’s still a long way from winning a professional life-changing major championship. But coming off the past few weeks, Fox is more than happy with where he is with 54 holes to go in New York.  “I generally like playing the week before a major, and I’ve always been, after a decent break, always been a little rusty coming back,” he said. “I did expect that. But I also thought this is kind of a golf course you don’t have to shoot 20-under a round. If you can shoot par this week, you’re going to be there or thereabouts … I managed to hit a few good shots out there and ride out a really hot putter.”  Perhaps the best benefit for Fox as he walked off the course Thursday afternoon was knowing he can return to his quiet hotel room.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0cy55YWhvby5jb20vcGdhLWNoYW1waW9uc2hpcC1yeWFuLWZveC1hZnRlci1wbmV1bW9uaWEtYmF0dGxlLWFuZC1iaXJ0aC1vZi1zZWNvbmQtY2hpbGQtc3VkZGVubHktaW4tdGhlLW1peC1hdC1vYWstaGlsbC0xOTU5MDAxODUuaHRtbNIBmgFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0cy55YWhvby5jb20vYW1waHRtbC9wZ2EtY2hhbXBpb25zaGlwLXJ5YW4tZm94LWFmdGVyLXBuZXVtb25pYS1iYXR0bGUtYW5kLWJpcnRoLW9mLXNlY29uZC1jaGlsZC1zdWRkZW5seS1pbi10aGUtbWl4LWF0LW9hay1oaWxsLTE5NTkwMDE4NS5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Birth control can help people plan their families, prevent unintended pregnancies and protect against sexually transmitted infections.  Everyone should have access to birth control regardless of their income, gender identity or sexual orientation. Governments and health care systems should work to ensure that birth control is affordable and accessible to all who need it.  There are a lot of arguments saying birth control should not be accessible over the counter, but I disagree. By making birth control pills available without a prescription, people could more easily obtain them and make informed decisions about their reproductive health.  Making birth control more accessible would positively impact people’s lives in several ways.For one, it would increase access to reproductive health care, which would help people plan and space out their pregnancies. This would lead to better health outcomes for parents and children as well as reduce the number of unintended pregnancies.  Additionally, making birth control more accessible would give people more control over their lives, allowing them to pursue their education, careers and other goals without worrying about an unplanned pregnancy.  Finally, this change would help to reduce the stigma surrounding contraception, which would encourage more people to use it and help to normalize conversations about reproductive health.

"birth","2020-04-01","Not Discerned","{""Home"", ""Washington"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 15:11:08","Body  The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated fear of childbirth among pregnant people in the U.S., according to a new Dartmouth study.  The researchers were particularly interested in understanding, from a U.S. context, which factors predict childbirth fear and how the pandemic has affected this fear and birth outcomes. The findings are published in Evolution, Medicine, and Public Health.  “Our results showed really high rates of childbirth fear in our sample,” says first author Zaneta Thayer ’08, an associate professor of anthropology. “Since there’s no pre-pandemic U.S. data, we cannot compare our data to that context but we know that the rates are very high compared to other international studies on the subject that have been published pre-pandemic.”  Quote Our work shows that there’s a need for childbirth fear to be included as part of maternal health care. Attribution Zaneta Thayer ’08, associate professor of anthropology  The research team drew on data from their COVID-19 and Reproductive Effects Study, an online survey which examined how COVID-19 affected pregnant people’s well-being and health care experiences.  From April 2020 to February 2021, they obtained prenatal data from 1,775 participants and postpartum data from 1,110 of the participants one month after their due date, which included information about childbirth experiences and birth outcomes. The majority of participants, 87%, self-identified as white, and 54% of participants were from households with an income of more than $100,000 per year.  The results showed that 62% of participants had clinically high levels of childbirth fear, also known as “tokophobia.”  Black mothers had a 90% higher chance of having childbirth fear than white mothers, which as the researchers explain, may reflect experiences with racism during their obstetric care.  Individuals in the lowest household income category of $50,000 per year or less and those without a college degree also had high levels of childbirth fear.  In addition, a high-risk pregnancy, prenatal depression, and a pre-existing health condition were also associated with childbirth fear.  Individuals who had childbirth fear had a 91% higher chance of having a preterm birth of less than 37 weeks of gestation. Low birth weight, however, was not significantly associated with childbirth fear.    Image Anthropology major Ale Geisel-Zamora ’23, left, and Associate Professor of Anthropology Zaneta Thayer ’08 were among the co-authors of the study. (Photo by Katie Lenhart)    Regarding COVID-19-related concerns, participants indicated that they were especially worried that they would not be able to have the support people that they wanted during labor, and that if they got sick with COVID-19 their baby would be taken away from them. They were also worried that if they got COVID-19 while pregnant they would give it to their baby.  “One of the motivations for this research was that the environment in which people give birth has changed over the last 100 years,” says Thayer. “At the turn of the century, most births were happening at home and families often had multiple children, so people’s familiarity with birth was a lot greater, but now, nearly all births in the US. take place in a hospital.”  “Nowadays, for many people, the first time they experience birth is when they are giving birth themselves, which can contribute to stress and anxiety,” says Thayer.  In the 1980s, researchers in Sweden and Finland began studying childbirth fear, which includes pregnant individuals’ concerns about managing pain, the risk of harm or death to themselves or their baby, and fear about the childbirth process. As a result of the research, pregnant people in Finland are screened for childbirth fear as part of their standard maternal care.  Dartmouth’s study is one of the first published studies to measure tokophobia in the U.S.  “Our findings illustrate that pregnant people are stressed in the U.S. birth environment and that they are not getting the emotional support they need,” says Thayer. “And the COVID-19 pandemic just added to those fears.”  “Our work shows that there’s a need for childbirth fear to be included as part of maternal health care,” says Thayer. “Prior research has shown that treating childbirth fear can reduce it and improve confidence in one’s ability to give birth.”  Thayer said she and her fellow researchers also recommend including and measuring childbirth fear in future maternal health studies to help inform care and treatment strategies.  Dartmouth anthropology major Ale Geisel-Zamora ’23, and former postdoctoral fellows Glorieuse Uwizeye, now at University of Western Ontario, and Theresa Gildner, now at Washington University in St. Louis, also served as co-authors of the study.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vaG9tZS5kYXJ0bW91dGguZWR1L25ld3MvMjAyMy8wNS9mZWFyLWNoaWxkYmlydGgtZXhhY2VyYmF0ZWQtY292aWQtMTktcGFuZGVtaWPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

There are a number of ways GPs can support parents and babies after a preterm birth.  An estimated 13.4 million preterm babies were born in 2020, resulting in nearly one million infant deaths, according to a new World Health Organization (WHO) report.    ‘Born too soon: decade of action on preterm birth’ also confirmed that it is now the leading cause of paediatric fatality, accounting for more than one in five of all deaths in children aged five and under.    Meanwhile, those who survive can face lifelong health consequences, with an increased likelihood of disability and developmental delays.    The report’s co-lead author, Professor Joy Lawn from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the findings show that no region of the world was able to improve preterm birth rates from 2010–20 and lay bare the ‘cost of inaction’ over the past decade.    ‘Preterm birth threatens health progress in every country,’ she said. ‘Greater investment in the care of vulnerable newborns can save millions of families from heartbreak.    ‘More work is also needed to prevent preterm birth, which will also improve progress in reducing stillbirths and maternal deaths. Together these twin tracks of preterm prevention and care will produce healthier individuals and societies to deliver on economic and social development.    ‘Our next generation depends on us all acting now – the investment may not be small but the returns on this investment will be major for every country.’    More than 26,000 preterm births occur in Australia each year, with the 8.6% rate slightly lower than the global average of one in 10 babies being born early.    Despite the lack of progress in recent years, Dr Wendy Burton, Chair of RACGP Specific Interests Antenatal and Postnatal Care, told newsGP ‘a lot of work’ is being dedicated to reducing preterm birth rates and improving outcomes among those born before the 37-week mark.    ‘Stillbirth and prematurity are of significant ongoing concern,’ she said.    ‘The reasons a multifactorial … [but] those of us working in the maternity field are trying to raise the profile of some specific factors.’    The strategies cited by Dr Burton, which are featured on The Australian Preterm Birth Prevention Alliance website include:  measuring the length of the cervix at all mid-pregnancy scans  using natural progesterone (200 mg each evening) if the length of the cervix is less than 25 mm  considering surgical cerclage if the length of the cervix continues to shorten despite progesterone treatment  using vaginal progesterone in pregnant people with a prior history of spontaneous preterm birth  identifying women who smoke and offering Quitline support  providing access to continuity of care from a known midwife during pregnancy, where possible.  Mobilising international and domestic resources to optimise maternal and newborn health, ensuring high-quality care is provided when and where it is needed  Meeting country targets for progress through implementing established national policies for maternal and newborn care  Promoting education through the lifecycle; supporting smarter economic investments, with co-financing across sectors; strengthening climate adaptation responses; advancing the coordination and resilience of emergency systems  Investing in locally led innovation and research to support improvements in quality of care and equity in access  Survival gaps by region, income, race  Dr Burton also says there are a number of ways GPs can support parents and babies after a preterm birth.‘Be kind, supportive and inform them of options for future pregnancy planning, eg use of vaginal progesterone and perhaps Omega 3 supplementation ,’ she said.On a broader scale, various WHO and United Nations organisations are calling for the following actions to improve care for women and newborns and mitigate risks from preterm births:The global report indicates that where babies are born often determines if they survive.The report notes that only one in 10 extremely preterm babies (<28 weeks) survive in low-income countries, compared to more than nine in 10 in high-income countries. Gaping inequalities related to race, ethnicity, income, and access to quality care also determine the likelihood of preterm birth, death, and disability, even in high-income countries like Australia.Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa have the highest rates of preterm birth, and preterm babies in these regions face the highest mortality risk. Together, these two regions account for more than 65% of preterm births globally.Air pollution is estimated to contribute to six million preterm births each year, while nearly one in 10 preterm babies are born in the 10 most fragile countries affected by humanitarian crises, according to a new analysis in the report.Maternal health risks, such as adolescent pregnancy and pre-eclampsia, are also closely linked to preterm births, which the authors say reinforces the need to ensure access to sexual and reproductive health services, including effective family planning, with high-quality care in pregnancy and around the time of birth.Log in below to join the conversation.  developmental delay infant death maternity care preterm birth","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3MS5yYWNncC5vcmcuYXUvbmV3c2dwL2NsaW5pY2FsL25vLXByb2dyZXNzLW9uLWxvd2VyaW5nLXByZXRlcm0tYmlydGgtcmF0ZS1pbi1wYXN00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"birth","1979-04-01","Not Discerned","{""Albuquerque"", ""NewMexico"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 21:58:24","In 1979, two M.I.T. computer-science alumni and a Harvard Business School graduate launched a new piece of computer software for the Apple II machine, an early home computer. Called VisiCalc, short for “visible calculator,” it was a spreadsheet, with an unassuming interface of monochrome numerals and characters. But it was a dramatic upgrade from the paper-based charts traditionally used to project business revenue or manage a budget. VisiCalc could perform calculations and update figures across columns and rows in real time, based on formulas that the user programmed in. No more writing out numbers painstakingly by hand.  VisiCalc sold more than seven hundred thousand copies in its first six years, and almost single-handedly demonstrated the utility of the Apple II, which retailed for more than a thousand dollars at the time (the equivalent of more than five thousand dollars in 2023). Prior to the early seventies, computers were centralized machines—occupying entire rooms—that academics and hobbyists shared or rented time on, using them communally. They were more boiler-room infrastructure than life-style accessory, attended to by experts away from the public eye. With the VisiCalc software, suddenly, purchasing a very costly and sophisticated machine for the use of a single employee made sense. The computer began moving into daily life, into its stalwart position on the top of our desks.  As Laine Nooney, a professor of media and information industries at New York University, writes in their recent book “The Apple II Age: How the Computer Became Personal” (University of Chicago Press), VisiCalc kicked off the process of “ ‘computerizing’ business.” By now, of course, everything else has been computerized as well. Computers today are not just personal devices but intimate appendages, almost extensions of our own bodies and brains. We use our smartphones in practically every aspect of life: working, socializing, dating, shopping, reading. Nooney’s book tracks the pivotal years of the shift toward personal computing, epitomized by the Apple II and sped along by consumer software—not just VisiCalc’s spreadsheets but adventure games and greeting-card-design tools—that made the computer a useful and convenient partner in daily life outside of the office, too.  Before there was the personal computer (which gave us the shorthand PC) the term of art for a domestic computing machine was “microcomputer.” The Altair 8800, which débuted, in 1975, was the first “microcomputer kit” to sell more than a few hundred units, according to Nooney. Made by a New Mexico company called MITS, which also sold kits for building rockets and calculators, the Altair emerged from a decentralized community of American computer hobbyists who were accustomed to building their own machines out of components from radios and televisions. “The Altair did not invent the idea of a computer one could personally own. Rather, it tapped into an ambient desire for ownership and individualized use,” Nooney writes. The goal was “to create a technological world fashioned to one’s own desires.” Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs, the co-founders of Apple, created the next wave of popular microcomputers with their first Apple computer, in 1976, and then the Apple II, in 1977. The latter was the company’s first commercial breakthrough; it went on to sell more than five million units. Wozniak’s technical innovations, such as designing circuits that were able to display different colors on a monitor, were matched by Jobs’s talent for creating a salable consumer product. He insisted that the Apple II be housed in a plastic casing, making it more elegant and approachable than hobbyists’ severe industrial boxes.  The development of the personal computer was iterative and contingent; it was not a matter of destiny but of experimentation in many different directions at once. The Apple II beat out its competitors, including the Commodore PET 2001 and the Tandy Corporation’s TRS-80 Model I, in part because of its open-endedness. Coming from the hobbyist community, Wozniak was used to designing computer hardware for expandability and modification. With the Apple II, purchasing a product off the shelf wasn’t conceived as an end point but as the start of a user’s process of customizing her own machine.  The Apple II looked a bit like a typewriter, with a keyboard extending off a sloped front. Accessories like monitors and drives were stacked on top like children’s building blocks. The user chose her own operating system and display monitor, and whichever appendages she desired, such as a modem or game controllers. To add RAM, she had to open the housing and plug in a microchip card. “Installing the memory expansion card is easy,” the Apple II manual cheerily promised, above a photo of the exposed guts of the computer. As the demands of software and equipment evolved, Apple II owners found that their machines had the flexibility to keep up.  Nooney’s book tells the story of how computers became irrevocably personal, but what’s most striking, revisiting the history of the Apple II, is how much less personalizable our machines have become. Computers today, small enough to fit in the palms of our hands, require much less work on the part of the user. Apple’s iPhones all look more or less the same. Their cases are sealed; when they break or glitch, or when an upgrade is required, we tend to replace them outright and discard the old one. We control their superficial traits—choosing between rose-gold or alpine-green case covers—but make few decisions about how they function. Customizable computer towers, like the Mac Pro, are the domain of professionals and experts—a video editor who needs extra horsepower, for example. The rest of us just flip open our laptops and expect everything to run on its own.  Whatever customization we do engage in has moved to the realm of the digital. We can load apps on our iPhones at the press of a button, but only those that Apple allows into its App Store, which has rigid rules around monetary transactions and content. Some new platforms, such as Mastodon and Urbit, allow users to run their own customizable iterations of social-media software, but doing so requires its own forms of expertise. Otherwise, the likes of Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok dictate our digital experiences in ways we can’t change. Nooney recounts how, over the seventies and eighties, investment began pouring in to technology and software companies from institutions and venture capitalists. Hobbyists and independent, small-scale firms that sold software in Ziploc bags were gradually crowded out by formalized, well-funded corporations advertised in glossy magazines and stocked by department stores.  Computers today are unavoidable fixtures of our lives, but instead of co-creators—modifying, hacking, and programming—we are sheer consumers. Our lack of agency is a boon for Silicon Valley companies, which profit from herding us frictionlessly through their gated infrastructure. Through digital data surveillance, we even become bulk products for the companies to sell in turn. Customization leads to diversity; diversity is less scalable, less easily packaged, and thus less profitable. Our computers may be personal, but they are not solely devoted to serving our needs. ♦","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3lvcmtlci5jb20vY3VsdHVyZS9pbmZpbml0ZS1zY3JvbGwvdGhlLWJpcnRoLW9mLXRoZS1wZXJzb25hbC1jb21wdXRlctIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Now, pregnant mothers in Northeast Michigan can choose to bring their newborns into the world at Lineage Midwifery, a new freestanding birth center in Rogers City.  Owner Val Meharg, who is a certified professional licensed midwife in Michigan, said the number of couples seeking alternatives to giving birth at a hospital was inching upward before the pandemic and accelerated during it.  She said now her list of her clients and interest in her services is rising quickly.  “Over the last few years, we have really seen a shift in the use of midwives for care,” Meharg said. “It also picked up during COVID when people realized maybe they didn’t want to go into a hospital because they didn’t want to expose themselves or their newborns around sick people.”  Meharg said a birthing center is an alternate location where mothers can safely and privately give birth with their loved ones near them. She said Lineage Midwifery is not associated with any hospital or health system, but has all of the needed credentials and licenses to provide child birth services at the center, or in the client’s home.  A midwife is a trained health professional who helps healthy women during labor, delivery, and after the birth of their babies.  Meharg said her business only works with low-risk pregnancies, which most pregnant women are.  “If there are risks like high blood pressure or diabetes, I have to refer them to a physician,” she said.  The birthing center does much more than just assist the mother during labor. Meharg said she will, with the help of her staff, work with a mother and the baby from prenatal care, through postpartum, and aftercare for the newborn once it’s born. It also provides education to new parents.  A midwife is one of the oldest professions and we work with the woman throughout her entire pregnancy,” Meharg said.  Having a baby is not cheap, and the cost of care and delivery at a hospital can put large debts on young families. Meharg said her services cost about $4,000 from start to finish.  Meharg said her business does accept certain types of private insurance, but as of now, she can’t accept Medicaid because the state doesn’t allow it yet.  People who are interested in the services of Lineage Midwifery can learn more on its website, lineagemidwifery.com or on its Facebook page.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWFscGVuYW5ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy8yMDIzLzA1L25ldy1yb2dlcnMtY2l0eS1iaXJ0aC1jZW50ZXItb2ZmZXJzLWFsdGVybmF0aXZlLWJpcnRoaW5nLXNlcnZpY2VzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The family says they have spent thousands of dollars trying to get the one certificate.  “There’s literally nothing I can do,” said Carder. “I can’t prove that she exists if she gets kidnapped or that she belongs to us if anything bad happens to her. I can’t prove that she belongs to us.”  We encourage all new parents to work with their birth clerks before going home to make sure all required forms are completed in order to delays.

Uniquely, the project will produce clean geothermal power for its own use and for sale into the market, in addition to lithium hydroxide. The hydroxide will start life as a lithium chloride concentrate, courtesy of a “Lithium Extraction Optimisation Plant” (LEOP) that will make use of direct lithium extraction (DLE) technology in preference to the huge and environmentally-tricky “ponds” that are often used in South America and elsewhere to essentially evaporate the water, leaving the lithium behind.  The final processing stage of the LEOP is a piece of plant known as a “Crystallizer” and in a move that shows Vulcan is serious about moving the ball forward, the company says the crystallizer went in this week.  After the release of a definitive feasibility study earlier this year that contained an eye-watering set of numbers, execution mode has gone into full swing at Vulcan. The company says that once operational and producing lithium chloride, the LEOP will usher in a game-changing new lithium era in Europe.  The LEOP will be fed with hot geothermal brines that will be harvested for their energy-producing potential before the lithium is directly extracted from them using the “sorption” method that has been successfully used in China.  The lithium chloride concentrate will then be trucked to another plant where it will be turned into the lucrative lithium hydroxide that the world is crying out for right now. And Vulcan has no shortage of big players that have already put their hand up for the hydroxide offtake, including Volkswagon, Stellantis, Renault, Umicore and LG Energy.  The German brine field, Vulcan’s birthplace, is Europe’s biggest lithium resource – and a globally-significant one, with the potential to supply product into the domestic battery electric vehicle markets. The brine field within Vulcan’s carbon-neutral project covers 1583 square kilometres and contains 26.6 million tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent in 10 of its 15 licenses. It is also located strategically in the middle of the European battery industry that is now starting to hit its straps.  Vulcan has its geothermal plant back up and running after a planned pause and has also acquired its first land package for its phase-one commercial lithium and renewable energy development, with further acquisitions expected in the coming weeks. It says the acquired land also proves it has a positive connection with the local community.  Management says drilling works and LEOP plant operation remain on track for this year’s third quarter.  Notably, Vulcan’s sorption-type DLE method is the same as that to be used by the merged Allkem and Livent operation following their show-stopping US$10.6 billion (AU$15.8 million) deal which created global headlines last week.  Chilean officials, as part of a mandate to cut the country’s water waste, recently revealed they would be backing new brine projects to use the direct extraction method and investment bank Goldman Sachs released a report last month clearly outlining that it preferred “briners to miners”.  Vulcan has also engaged international law firm White and Case as its borrower’s legal advisor to work alongside BNP Paribas in its debt-financing process. It says has already had positive feedback from multiple commercial and development banks after dragging its briefcase around to see some of the industry’s bigger financial players.  Letters of intent have been secured from the French, Italian and Canadian government Export Credit Agencies, which the company says is in line with similar approaches taken by successful project developers in the past. French Agency, bpiFrance, has classed Vulcan’s project as being of strategic importance and management intends to have its entire debt and equity project funding in place by the first quarter of next year.  Vulcan is leveraging its existing cash to advance engineering and order commercial long-lead items, while financing for the full-project capital expenditure is ongoing. The company last week revealed it had raised $109 million from institutional investors in Australia, Europe, the United States and Hong Kong. It has $270 million in cash and no debt and is rapidly advancing the execution of its phase-one commercial project.  The sheer scale, strategic simplicity and logic of Vulcan’s plan is clear and if it all comes together, it will no doubt spark a run on other geothermal brines that might contain lithium.  The company’s DFS shows margins that would make a hard-rock miner blush, largely due to the fact that it will uniquely produce (and even sell) its own geothermal energy – a major cost factor at any operation.  The project is as big as it is bold and is currently hailed as the largest lithium deposit in Europe. If lithium is to be the new oil, as it is sometimes described, this is one company that has plenty.  Is your ASX-listed company doing something interesting?

"birth","2009-10-05","12:00:00","{""Boston"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 19:49:29","An independent advisory committee to the Food and Drug Administration voted Thursday to recommend a shot that protects infants from RSV by vaccinating their mothers while pregnant.  The 14-person panel unanimously recommended the shot, made by Pfizer, based on its efficacy and voted 10-4 to recommend it based on its safety.  If the shot is eventually approved by the FDA, it would be the first vaccine that confers protection against respiratory syncytial virus to babies.  “Before the pandemic, RSV was the No. 1 cause of infant hospitalization in the United States, so this is a big deal,” said Dr. Ofer Levy, the director of the Precision Vaccines Program at Boston Children’s Hospital. Levy is a temporary voting member of the FDA panel but wasn’t involved in Thursday’s vote.  In healthy adults, lower respiratory illness caused by RSV is typically mild, but it can be more severe in babies and older adults. The virus kills up to 300 children under 5 every year in the U.S. and up to 10,000 people ages 65 or older, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Severe infections can result in pneumonia or bronchiolitis, which inflames airways and clogs them with mucus.  It could take months for the FDA to decide whether to approve the shot, but the agency is likely to follow the advisory committee’s recommendation.  The FDA approved the world’s first RSV vaccine this month, made by pharmaceutical giant GSK, but the shot is only for adults ages 60 and up.  Pfizer also has an RSV shot for older adults up for FDA approval this month. The FDA advisory panel in late February recommended the shot for people ages 60 and up. It’s the same vaccine that would be given to pregnant people.  To protect infants, the shot would be given to pregnant people at 24 to 36 weeks’ gestation; the protective antibodies transfer through the placenta.  The committee members generally praised the vaccine’s efficacy but shared reservations about the duration of protection and a potential risk of preterm birth.  In a clinical trial with nearly 7,400 participants, the vaccine lowered the risk of severe disease from RSV among infants by 82% within roughly three months after birth. By around six months, efficacy was around 69%. Infants 6 months and younger are especially vulnerable to severe cases of RSV.  The shot also lowered the risk of developing respiratory disease from RSV that required doctors’ visits by 51% within about six months. After that, however, the vaccine didn’t appear to make a big difference.  In a briefing document, the FDA said safety data from the trial seemed “generally favorable.” The most common side effects of the shot reported among pregnant women were fatigue, headache, muscle pain and injection site pain.  However, the agency noted that there was a slightly higher rate of preterm births — defined as before 37 weeks’ gestation — among people who received the vaccine (5.7%) versus those who got a placebo (4.7%). The difference wasn’t statistically significant, however, so it’s unclear whether it was vaccine-related.  Both rates were lower than the rate of preterm births in the general population: around 10%, according to the CDC.  Last year, the pharmaceutical giant GSK halted its trial of an RSV vaccine for infants after it showed a higher preterm birth rate among some vaccine recipients.  Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the FDA advisory committee and director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said the outcome of GSK’s trial was relevant to Pfizer’s study, since the two vaccines are similar.  “I worry that if preterm births are in any way a consequence of this vaccine, that would be tragic in many ways,” Offit said at Thursday’s meeting. He voted against the shot based on its safety.  Pfizer said that if its shot is approved, it would continue to monitor the risk of preterm birth among vaccine recipients.  Levy said researchers generally pay close attention to any potential risk of preterm birth among vaccines given to pregnant people.  “There’s always the background concern: Are you inducing some inflammation that could be a problem? Because the body reads inflammation as ‘the woman’s no longer safe, let’s get the baby out.’ So you want a fairly bland vaccine,” he said.  But Adam Berger, a researcher at the National Institutes of Health who voted in favor of the shot based on both safety and efficacy, said the vaccine is strongly needed.  “There isn’t another option here for prevention and it really could save a lot of lives,” Berger said.  Eleven RSV vaccines (including GSK’s approved shot) are being actively studied in U.S. trials, according to data provided to NBC News by PATH, a nonprofit global health organization. Six are for older adults, and five are designed to protect infants or children.  A monoclonal antibody injection, which is given directly to infants and functions similarly to a vaccine, has already been approved in Canada, Europe and the United Kingdom. The FDA began reviewing data on that shot in January and is expected to decide this summer or fall whether to approve it.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY25ld3MuY29tL2hlYWx0aC9raWRzLWhlYWx0aC9yc3YtdmFjY2luZS1pbmZhbnRzLWZkYS1wYW5lbC12b3RlLXJjbmE4NDc0MNIBKmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvYW1wL3JjbmE4NDc0MA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

By Lisa Fishbayn Joffe  Reading the Torah, there is no doubt about motherhood's important role in Jewish literature and life.  The Hebrew Bible is replete with stories of women who feel incomplete without children, although Orthodox interpretation holds that only men are commanded to ""be fruitful and multiply."" Unable to bear children, Sarah offers her handmaid Hagar to her husband, Abraham, so he can father a child.  Rachel longs for deliverance from infertility, saying, ""Give me children or I shall die,"" and Hannah provides a model for Jewish personal prayer when she fervently prays for a child on the steps of the Temple in Jerusalem.    Women are not, however, expected to place motherhood ahead of their own well-being. (See ""Do Abortion Bans Violate Jews' Religious Rights?"") For example, Jewish law not only permits but requires that a pregnancy be terminated when it jeopardizes the life of the mother.    Of course, many stories in Jewish sacred texts celebrate women for reasons that have nothing to do with parenting – from Queen Esther's bravery in the Book of Esther to the powerful judge Deborah in the Book of Judges and wise women like Beruriah, who is quoted in the Talmud.  Yet the value placed on motherhood is clear – not only in Jewish texts but also in Jewish traditions.  For centuries, ritual practices have celebrated the birth of children. Yet they have not always given new mothers an opportunity to celebrate on their own terms or share their own feelings.  As a scholar of Judaism and gender, though, I have seen how this is changing, as Jewish women reinvent meaningful traditions or develop new ones.  Medieval Mothers  Behind the Mehitza  According to historian Elisheva Baumgarten , medieval Jewish women in northern and eastern Europe observed a monthlong period of lying-in after the birth, where they were cared for at home by friends.Upon its conclusion, the new mother would then go to synagogue on the Sabbath to say prayers of thanks and have special tunes sung in her honor. If she had borne a boy, she might craft an embroidered wimpel – a band used to bind a Torah scroll closed when it is not being read – made from a strip of the cloth used to swaddle her son during his circumcision ceremony, often called a bris or brit milah.In her book "" Painted Pomegranates and Needlepoint Rabbis ,"" religion scholar Jodi Eichler-Levine analyzes this practice as a way for new mothers, confined to the women's section of the synagogue, to insert themselves into what is otherwise an all-male ritual space.Describing the emergence of a modern Jewish crafting movement, Eichler-Levine also notes that ""in recent years, the wimpel has made a comeback,"" created by mothers and grandmothers to honor the birth of children regardless of their sex.  When my oldest child was born 26 years ago, options for celebrating her birth in the Jewish community in Johannesburg, South Africa, were limited. After we brought her home from the hospital, my husband and I attended Shabbat services at the Orthodox synagogue he had grown up in.    As I looked on from behind the mehitza, the screen that separates men's and women's areas in Orthodox congregations, he was honored by being called up to the Torah during the service, and our daughter's name was announced to the community.    I, on the other hand, was encouraged to privately bentsch gommel: recite the prayer for having survived an illness or a perilous journey.    Then we went home. And that was it. This seemed an underwhelming way to acknowledge her arrival and my having given birth to her.    Elsewhere, Jewish feminists had begun creating new rituals to mark moments in women's and girls' lives – but in the late 1990s, that innovation was not yet felt in Johannesburg.    I located a copy of ""The New Jewish Baby Book,"" imported from the United States. Written by essayist and novelist Anita Diamant, the guide included sample rituals for welcoming the birth of a girl.    Together with my mother-in-law, a psychoanalyst who loved to cater a stylish celebration, and my sister-in-law, a journalist with a gift for powerful public speech, we crafted a ritual to take place in my in-law's home that announced our daughter's name and offered the women in our family a more significant role.  It was an opportunity for me, as her mother, to acknowledge the beloved grandmothers and biblical figures for whom she was named and to express my hopes that a life of meaning, connection, and community lay ahead of her.  Tradition for the 21st Century  Though we didn't realize it at the time, the ritual we created reflected many themes of contemporary Jewish feminist innovation.  In the book "" Inventing Jewish Ritual ,"" anthropologist Vanessa Ochs describes how a movement among liberal Jews to engage in ritual innovation began in the 1970s.  Alongside secular do-it-yourself texts like ""Our Bodies, Ourselves,"" which urged women to take ownership over their sexual and reproductive health, Jewish women began to design novel rituals that marked transformative moments in women's lives.  These included moments that had long gone unremarked in Jewish public life, including the onset of menstruation, pregnancy, birth, miscarriage, infertility, abortion, and menopause.    Our family ritual shared many features with those being developed by other Jewish parents around the world. My daughter's naming ceremony was created from a template that allowed for improvisation and personalization. It enabled a new shared experience, and it took place outside the synagogue, in the less regulated space of a private home.    Rituals to mark the birth of girls are now widely accepted across all Jewish denominations. Templates and sample prayers are available in books like Israeli professor and politician Aliza Lavie's anthology, ""A Jewish Woman's Prayer Book,"" and websites like ritualwell.org.    More recently, new rituals have been created to allow a woman to reflect upon the impact that becoming a mother has on her life.  The mikveh, or ritual bath, plays a central role in observance of Jewish laws relating to family purity, which may involve women immersing after menstruation and after giving birth.    Jewish feminists have sought to reclaim the practice of ritual immersion to mark other developments in women's lives, including becoming a mother, and to shift the focus of ritual from the moment of transition in status to the shift in perspective brought by occupying a new role.    The poet Hila Ratzabi, for example, created ""A Rebirth Ritual for Mothers"" to be used at any time after a birth, providing an opportunity to reflect on how becoming a mother has transformed one's life.  The ritual includes sharing reflections on the challenging and empowering moments in the birth, the experience of motherhood and the experience of immersion, and includes these touching words:  As I step toward these healing waters, I acknowledge the great transitions I underwent in becoming a mother.  I come to the mikveh to acknowledge that these powerful birth experiences made me a mother, and I choose to step into my power.  I come to the mikveh to remind myself that I am always loved, always held, always growing, always whole.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyYW5kZWlzLmVkdS9qZXdpc2gtZXhwZXJpZW5jZS9ob2xpZGF5cy1yZWxpZ2lvdXMtdHJhZGl0aW9ucy8yMDIzL21heS9tb3RoZXJob29kLWp1ZGFpc20tcml0dWFscy5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"birth","2023-05-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 07:55:11","Was Hanuman The Brother Of Rama By Birth? Yoga Spirituality oi-Pundreeka Valli  Kesari, the king of monkeys and Anjanadevi, a cursed nymph or apsara were the parents to Lord Hanuman. We can see that in scriptures Hanuman is also addressed as Kesari Nandan, Anjani putra.  The best example would be chalisa where both these names are mentioned while singing his praises.He is the most ardent devotee of Lord Rama who treated him as his own brother.  There is a strong background to the belief that Ram and Hanuman were real brothers. Let us delve into this relationship to know more about it.  It so coincided that Anjani was meditating on Lord Shiva in order to get a son like him. On the other side, in Dasharathas palace, the putrakameshthi yaga was being conducted.  Both the Tapasya and homa had only one purpose-of begetting a progeny. During Dasharathas yagnya, finally , as an answer to his prayer, Agnideva appeared with a golden kalash in his hand which he intended to give Dasharatha. The kalasha had nectar like sweet stew or payasa.  Agni instructed Dasharatha that this payasa should be consumed by his queens so that they can conceive. As per this instruction, king was taking Payasa to the antahpura in the palace. Antahpura is the queen's cabin or room inside the palace.  As he was carrying the kalasha in his hand, as luck would have it, an eagle swooped down near him, took a large mouthful of the payasa and flew away to the place where Anjani was worshipping Lord Shiva for a son.  Lord Shiva appeared before her and asked her to lift up her hands and keep her palms ready for receiving something. It was at this point that the eagle flew towards her and unable to gulp the payasa, it dropped it into Anjana's hand.  Anjani consumed it thinking that it was Lord Shivas will and boon to her. She gave birth to Hanuman as a result, got rid of her curse, and got back her original form os an apsara. Here the royal queens too gave birth to kids.  Kausalya gave birth to Rama. Here the most important point to note is that both Rama and Hanuman were conceived by their mothers after consuming the same payasa. So, it is only right to call them as brothers.  Although the women who consumed the payasa were different and were married to different people, the payasa that was taken by these women was the same.  It was responsible for helping the women conceive. Hence although this fact is not mentioned in Valmiki Ramayana, Ananda Ramayana carries this information and tale. Ananda Ramayana is an abridged form of Adhyatma Ramayana written by Sage Valmiki.  But It is not surprising to believe, knowing the power of both Hanuman and Rama and their relationship, that Hanuman was a true brother of Rama. He proved himself as true brother to Ram in his avatar in Treta yuga. He deserved to be Ramas brother from any angle.  GET THE BEST BOLDSKY STORIES!

The first, near universal moment is buying a “real” bike. Then, once the triathlon mania sets in, you want to get better, so you level up again. Maybe you’ll join a club or hire a coach. Next comes a power meter or a smart trainer. Then it’s downloading Zwift.  For the unindoctrinated few, Zwift is part training tool and part video game. It makes indoor bike training actually fun—and to some–even addictive; so addictive that some triathletes have given up riding outdoors altogether except on race days.  Riding indoors is the answer to a bunch of problems, including bad weather, bad roads and bad drivers. For young parents, it’s the solution to finding a babysitter or negotiating with a partner over who stays home. Yet, for all its upsides, riding indoors without the aid of distraction is mind-numbingly boring.  Boredom is the Mother of Invention  This was the reality faced in 2010 by California-based programmer Jon Mayfield: recently married, with a new home and a baby on the way, the new house was within eyesight of southern California’s Santa Ana River Trail, which every weekend attracted hundreds of local cyclists. One hybrid bike later and Mayfield was a newly minted cyclist. Flash forward six months and he’d upgraded to a cherry-red Specialized Roubaix, but with a newborn, getting out on the trail just wasn’t going to happen.  Meanwhile in another part of the world, tech entrepreneur Eric Min was thinking about a new challenge. He’d spent eight years as a VP at JP Morgan Chase in New York City, then had co-founded a London-based software company, where he’d spent another 15 years. But Min’s other passion was cycling.  Min had begun riding seriously at age 14 with Olympic aspirations. A successful amateur, he made it all the way to Olympic training camp. He loved racing, but almost equally, he loved the culture of cycling: the group rides, with guys jockeying for position and showing each other up, the trash talk, the bravado. He loved the social rides and friendships, the endless chats about gear and training.  And as a serious amateur, Min recognized the value in off-season indoor riding. But he hated it. Whether on rollers or a bike trainer, his indoor training was effective, but so boring. There was no one to talk to, no one to ride with, no one to compete against.  Around 2012, Min’s business life and personal passion converged. He found himself at a career crossroads, casting about for a  “Big Idea,” but it seemed that all the great new tech ideas were taken. His brother urged him to pursue combining what he knew best: technology and cycling.  Indoor Cycling was Spinning its Wheels  Both Min and Mayfield knew that indoor cycling had stagnated. The same basic bike trainers had been around for years. For triathletes and cyclists, one viable solution was CompuTrainer, which used proprietary hardware to control a trainer’s resistance on the rear tire. The company pioneered the electronic bike trainer, and for two decades was the only real player in the game.  Long before Garmin, the CompuTrainer setup allowed riders to collect and view cycling data, displayed on a screen during a ride. While revolutionary in the 90’s and 2000s, CompuTrainer had limitations. There were wires between the trainer and head unit, which complicated setup. You had to calibrate and warm up the system for a good 15-minutes before starting a ride or your numbers would be off. And the system was expensive. In today’s dollars, it would set you back more than $2,500, clearly out of reach for most.  And CompuTrainer was a closed system. It didn’t work with emerging wireless standards like WiFi, Bluetooth or ANT+. While the system included some rudimentary graphics, riders had just a plain road and a few blobby trees to look at, with a distant skyline or landscape. To facilitate group rides, bike shops would set up CompuTrainer studios, where cyclists could mount their bikes to a line of CompuTrainer systems side-by-side.  Enter the Disrupter  Zwift is the confluence of right time, right place, right people. A few years earlier and the technology would have been too expensive or too obscure. A few years later and other startups might have snatched market share. And if two people that had never met each other didn’t meet, then the know-how + investment + passion, with a big dose of nerdiness that resulted in Zwift would have never happened.  By 2013 Jon Mayfield had developed his own sophisticated solution for indoor training. Teaching himself to code, he gradually improved his “CRBike Coach” software. He was the only user.  Mayfield had created the graphics for video games for years, with credits on games such as Disney Princess: My Fairytale Adventure, Dreamworks Kartz, and Phineas and Ferb. His cycling program began as a little project over a Christmas vacation, where he wrote his first few lines of code in his home’s guest bedroom. He iterated on his side project for years, adding the ability to capture cycling data through a power meter and evolving the visuals. The very first virtual bike for the program was based on his own cherry-red Roubaix.  He began posting about his software on triathlon forums like Slowtwitch, looking for a partner or investor. He thought about creating a Kickstarter to try to find funding to make CRBike Coach into a real consumer product. Eric Min saw one of those forum posts and connected with Mayfield. By early 2014, they were co-founders of a yet-to-be-named project.  Gamer + Trainer  As Mayfield tinkered in his spare room, he drafted features that are at still for the core of Zwift: that at its heart, it’s a video game.  In an interview with Slowtwitch, Mayfield said, “I often get asked ‘Is Zwift a game or a training tool?’ It’s an odd question because training, to me, has always been a game. Whether I was trying to optimize my CdA in aerolab, trying to best my current FTP, or trying to move up a few percent on the local Strava segment, it’s always been gamified in my mind.”  His first version of his ‘game’ merely collected and graphed data from the bike on a screen. By 2011, he had developed a joystick that could be used to ‘steer’ in the game to collect coins while riding. From there, he figured out how to pause and return to the game, and he started using ANT+ wireless connectivity to communicate with the bike sensors.  Then came better graphics and some AI ‘riders’ to ride against. He made an Android app that could connect to the software over his WiFi network so a phone could be used as a display and input device.  By early 2014, he had added what he called “pain portals” that represented the start and end of an interval. Zwift users today will recognize those ‘portal’ entries; most now look like inflated archways, and riders still collect coins and points in the game.  After Min reached out, Mayfield hosted Min and co-founder Scott Barger in that same spare room to demonstrate his project. His heart was racing, finally getting to show his passion project to potential partners. He’d accidently left his heart-rate monitor on, so  Min and Barger were able to see just how nervous he was, with his HR graphed on the display screen while they spoke.  The World of Zwift  With a unified vision and the funding to match, the new company ramped up quickly, and by late 2014 was in beta testing. It officially launched to the public in October 2015, with a choice of two riding environments, the fantastical “Watopia” and the more realistic Richmond.  It’s a little disappointing that the company’s name wasn’t the result of a half-asleep, in-the-shower eureka, but rather, evolved out of sessions with a marketing agency. Even so, it’s apt, meant to suggest both motion and fun.  What started as a way to make cycling less boring has evolved into a powerhouse across cycling and triathlon. For around $15 per month and a compatible bike trainer, anyone ride one of Zwift’s nine virtual worlds, and users can make it as much of a game as they want. You can customize your avatar by switching out gear and clothing. The longer you use the program, the points you rack up, which allows you to “buy” upgrades within the game.  Just as with any video game, players reach levels (there are 50 levels currently), and receive badges and awards. But one of the most loved aspects of Zwift is the social integration. At any point, you’ll see a list of riders on the course with you, and they’re not AI…they’re actual people from around the world.  Through the Zwift companion app, you can text other riders, or give them a “thumbs up.” The companion app also makes group rides possible. You can organize a meetup with friends or teammates, attend “celebrity” rides with pro cyclists and triathletes, and join pace groups. The Zwift platform hosts dozens of races every week, including the Zwift Racing League.  The exact number of subscribers around the world isn’t publicly available, but it’s believed that there are around 500,000 users worldwide.  It has been reported that subscribers nearly doubled during the pandemic. With no live events, and everyone stuck at home, Zwift was the perfect companion. The countries with the highest number of Zwift users included Spain and Italy, countries hard-hit by lockdowns.  According to Richard Melik, sports-marketing lead for Zwift, the pandemic accelerated some plans Zwift had already been discussing. Namely, a series of races featuring the world’s best triathletes. That became the Z PRO Race Series, which featured triathletes in their home pain caves competing for significant prize money.  Says Melik, “It was surreal to see athletes of the caliber of Gustav Iden, Kristian Blummenfelt, the Brownlee brothers, Flora Duffy, Georgia Taylor-Brown and Chelsea Sodaro all mixing it up on the roads of Watopia.”  What’s Next: Live Racing  Just as eSports evolved to live events where an audience watches elite gamers play World of Warcraft and other games in a auditoriums and arenas, Zwift has followed suit.  What started as a race series in triathletes living rooms has morphed into an entirely new type of event: a hybrid live/virtual triathlon.  Dubbed the Super League Arena Games, this year’s series of three events featured a live audience watching pro triathletes compete in a hybrid environment. A pool swim was followed by live bike racing on trainers through Zwift’s virtual world, then a treadmill run, also through the fantasy environment of Zwift. It’s fast-paced, with athletes switching disciplines multiple times, all displayed for spectators on massive screens with pumping music and commentary.  Along with the PTO and Challenge/Clash, part of Zwift’s aim is to turn triathlon into a prime-time watchable sport with professional athletes and a legion of fans to follow them. The next events in the series, which began in Montreal, include events in Switzerland and Singapore. Spectators can watch in person or choose to stream the event, and the spectacle opens a new revenue stream for pros.  Says Melik: “We know that shorter formats of triathlon appeal to a wider broadcast audience. The Mixed Team Relays at the Olympics have been the gold standard in attracting a non-endemic audience to the sport and there are elements of Arena Games that mean it is well placed to do the same.”  For an age group triathlete using Zwift at home, watching the pros riding on Zwift is a thrill.

The 10-year-old mother musk ox was evidently already pregnant when she arrived at Korkeasaari from a zoo in Cologne about half a year ago, so Kili's father also has German roots. Kili is not the mother's first calf, as she had also given birth in Cologne before.  The mother was brought to Helsinki with the aim to increase the zoo's musk ox herd.  There are only about 80 musk oxen in zoos around Europe. The species was on the verge of extinction due to excessive hunting about a century ago, but conservation efforts have improved the situation and as a species, musk oxen populations are now considered to be stable.

Shivakumar is a prominent figure belonging to the Vokkaliga community, an influential political and social group in Karnataka. He has a younger brother named D.K. Suresh, who is also actively involved in politics.  Political Career  Shivakumar embarked on his political journey in the early 1980s, initially as a student leader. In 1984, he became president of the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) student wing. His political ascent continued as he secured his first election victory in 1989, representing the Sathanur constituency in the Karnataka Legislative Assembly. The prominent politician has been successfully re-elected to the Assembly eight times, reflecting his enduring popularity among the constituents.  Throughout his career, Shivakumar has assumed several ministerial roles within the Karnataka government. From 1999 to 2004, he served as the Minister of State for Home in the S.M. Krishna government. In the Siddaramaiah government, from 2013 to 2018, he held the portfolios of Minister of Energy and Minister of Large and Medium Industries.  As a senior leader and active member of the Congress Party, Shivakumar is recognised for his charismatic demeanour and his ability to forge connections with the masses. He is renowned for his flamboyant style and unwavering commitment to championing the rights of society's underprivileged and marginalised sections.

One significant incident occurred in 2019, when he was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on charges of money laundering. After spending over 50 days in jail, he was eventually granted bail.  In addition to the money laundering case, Shivakumar has faced allegations of corruption and nepotism. In 2017, he was accused of favouring his son-in-law, Amartya Hegde, in the allocation of a government contract, raising concerns about preferential treatment.  Despite these controversies, Shivakumar continues to wield influence and maintain popularity in Karnataka politics. He was initially regarded as a prominent figure capable of potentially assuming the role of Chief Minister in the future. However, in a recent update, Siddharamaiah will soon be announced as Karnataka’s CM, and Shivakumar will be his deputy. The veteran political leader has said that he has to “sacrifice in the interest of the party”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmphZ3Jhbmpvc2guY29tL2dlbmVyYWwta25vd2xlZGdlL2RrLXNoaXZha3VtYXItYmlvZ3JhcGh5LWFnZS1iaXJ0aC1lZHVjYXRpb24tcG9saXRpY2FsLWNhcmVlci1hbmQtbW9yZS0xNjg0MzkyNzA3LTHSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuamFncmFuam9zaC5jb20vZ2VuZXJhbC1rbm93bGVkZ2UvYW1wL2RrLXNoaXZha3VtYXItYmlvZ3JhcGh5LWFnZS1iaXJ0aC1lZHVjYXRpb24tcG9saXRpY2FsLWNhcmVlci1hbmQtbW9yZS0xNjg0MzkyNzA3LTE?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

But one mum-to-be was left gobsmacked when her mother-in-law came up with a ""money-saving suggestion"" to help cut down on costs - as it turned out there was a pretty hefty catch.  The woman, who is from the US, explained her hospital bill for delivering her baby will come to around $8,000 (£6,400), so she and her husband are currently trying to save as much money as possible before the baby arrives.  So, when her mother-in-law asked to borrow $300 (£240), they had to refuse and tried to explain why before she came up with her own cost-cutting solution - delivering the baby herself.

My husband's family is pretty bad with money and his sister and his mum both currently owe us thousands.  ""I pull up records I have of what they owe and for what to give my husband context during the call, and remind him that thanks to my cr***y insurance, we're going to be on the hook for an $8k hospital bill in a couple of months. He relayed the hospital bill information to my MIL, saying sorry mum, we have some significant expenses coming up and can't afford to pay for her ticket.  ""He tells her how much the bill will be and cue the shouting. 'Why are you doing that?!' 'Why don't you just have the baby at home?', which I would honestly prefer, but it'd be $13k (£10.4k) if we tried at home and then had to transfer. The shouting continues … 'I had all my babies at home! I have some midwifery experience, I'll just deliver the baby myself!'""  The mum-to-be was horrified at the idea of her mother-in-law delivering her baby, as she explained that while she did give birth to all six of her children at home, half of the births resulted in ""serious infections"" that left her hospitalised.  Understandably, the mum-to-be refused to put her health at risk just so she could give her cash away to her husband's family instead.  She added: ""Yes, she had 6 kids at home, BUT my idiot father-in-law left CHUNKS of placenta inside her and she got pretty serious infections 3 of the 6 times. All infections required a minimum 2-day hospital stay, and she's honestly lucky to be alive.  ""Problem two, she likely has the same 'training' idiot FIL received in the 70s and putting aside that her knowledge is sorely out of date, she's not a licensed midwife. Problem three, I don't want her within five miles of me when I'm having this baby, let alone near my bits catching my son.  ""Problem four, you're only offering this so we'll give you more money??? No.""  Commenters on the post were equally as horrified, with many saying the couple's money should all be going toward their child from now on, not their other relatives.  One person said: ""I thought this was going to be a sweet story about your MIL being an ob-gyn … This took a turn. And please don’t give them any more money.

"birth","2023-04-13","Not Discerned","{""Oregon"", ""Ohio"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 16:29:21","Quick Take  An Oregon bill that would eliminate parental consent for minors to access reproductive health care, including abortion, has been criticized by conservatives. But a liberal social media post mischaracterizes their opposition by claiming Republicans said girls “should be allowed to be forced to give birth to their rapist’s baby if the rapist is their father.”  Full Story  Oregon Democrats have proposed legislation aimed at removing barriers to abortion and gender-affirming care, while Republican lawmakers have pushed back against the measure, saying it goes too far.  Social media posts from each side have focused on the bill’s proposed change to abortion access laws — in particular, parental consent requirements for some minors.  Current state law is a little unclear about the rules for parental consent for those under 15, but experts generally agree that those older than 15 can seek an abortion without consent from their parents and those younger than 15 cannot.  The law says that a medical provider can give “birth control information and services to any person without regard to the age of the person” and then, in the next paragraph, specifies that only those 15 and older can decide on medical treatment without the consent of a parent.  “Current law is that if someone is under 15, she’ll need to get consent from a parent to get an abortion in Oregon. If she’s 16 or 17, she doesn’t need parental consent to get an abortion in Oregon,” Anna Sortun, an Oregon lawyer who is contributing to a reproductive rights hotline run by the state’s attorney general, said in an email to FactCheck.org.  Similarly, the state Supreme Court wrote in a non-binding 2006 opinion that the current law “authorizes a minor female 15 years of age or older to consent to the performance of an abortion by a physician without the consent of the minor’s parent or guardian. A parent or guardian still must consent to the performance of an abortion for a minor female 14 years of age or younger.”  The proposed change — which has passed the Democrat-led House and is now awaiting a vote in the Democrat-controlled Senate — would definitively establish that people of any age could seek out reproductive health care, including abortion, without parental consent.  Under this bill, “a minor of any age can make that determination,” Lori Anne Sills, of the nonpartisan legislative counsel’s office, explained at an April 13 meeting of the Joint Committee on Ways and Means, which is made up of members from both chambers.  At that meeting, Republican state Sen. Tim Knopp asked Sills, “a 10-year-old could make that decision on their own, then?”  “Yes,” Sills said. “Let me clarify… under the House Bill 2002, a minor of any age can make reproductive health care decisions and that includes undergoing an abortion.”  “Alright, well, that’s just shocking,” Knopp said.  Knopp, the Senate Republican leader, released a joint statement with the Republican leader of the House later that day highlighting that point, saying, “10-year-olds would be able to get abortions without parental knowledge under the legislation.”  The official Twitter account for the Oregon House Republicans then emphasized that part of the bill on May 1, calling the measure “too extreme.”  But a popular liberal Twitter account run by Brian Tyler Cohen later misleadingly claimed on May 2: “Oregon Republicans are arguing that 10-year-old girls should be allowed to be forced to give birth to their rapist’s baby if the rapist is their father.”  But none of the Republicans had suggested that a 10-year-old should be forced to give birth. Rather, they argued that parents should be involved in medical decision-making for minors.  For example, the conservative-leaning organization Oregon Right to Life, which opposes the bill, submitted written testimony that said, in part, “Although we can agree that not every parent is a good parent (such as in cases of abuse), we recognize that parental involvement is wise in every other major decision in a child’s life. Removing parental involvement prior to making a life-changing decision significantly changes how minors consent to abortions. Parents should be empowered to help and support their children during a vulnerable and confusing time, not removed from the equation.”  Addressing Parental Permission  During the April 13 committee meeting, Democratic state Sen. Elizabeth Steiner — who is a doctor and a sponsor of the bill — responded to criticism that the change would cut out parents from major health decisions.  “While I firmly believe that every person in this room would have compassion on their 14-year-old child and want to engage with them on this conversation in a loving and caring way,” she said, “I can tell you from deep personal experience that, unfortunately, not every parent is like that.”  In most cases, though, a physician would encourage parental involvement, Steiner said.  “There is no desire to separate children from their parents in this,” she said.  The Oregon Attorney General’s Sexual Assault Task Force — which is a statewide non-profit that works to prevent and respond to sexual violence and is not part of the Department of Justice, as is suggested by the name — favors the legislation.  “If we want survivors of abuse and violence to have access to meaningful support services, we need to support reproductive health care,” the organization’s interim executive director, Bethany Walmsley, wrote in testimony submitted in support of the bill. “If we want to prevent abuse and violence from happening in the first place, we need to ensure people have access to health services without barriers.”  It’s rare for those under 15 to seek abortion, regardless of whether or not they are required to have parental permission.  In 2021, there were 14 abortions performed on patients younger than 15 in the state, according to the Oregon Health Authority. In the year before, there were 20 abortions.  That accounts for 0.3% of the state’s abortions in 2021, which is on par with the rates for that age group in other states regardless of parental consent laws, according to national data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Parental consent laws vary by state, with some requiring consent from one parent, a grandparent or other adult relative. According to the Guttmacher Institute, 36 states require parental consent and/or notification or the involvement of a family member, although a minor can obtain court approval for an abortion in all but one of those states.  We don’t know how many 10-year-olds would likely be affected since there is no data available for that age group and the bill’s primary sponsors didn’t answer our email seeking clarification. But few would likely be affected given the relatively low number of abortions and the similarly low number of births among those under 15. (There were 11 births in that age group in Oregon in 2021 and 10 in 2020.)  Hannah Kurowski, spokeswoman for the Oregon House Majority Office, which is Democratic, told us, “No minor in Oregon is ever alone in making these decisions.”  “Medical providers, who are trained to screen for abuse and protect the health and wellbeing of their patients, will always work with minor patients to ensure they have a network of safe adults to support them, especially when they are making significant medical decisions,” she said. “This bill does not change that.” (Emphasis is Kurowski’s.)  So, the focus among Republicans on the effect of the bill for that young age exaggerates its impact.  But the response from the liberal Twitter account mischaracterizes the point Republican opponents were making.

Speaking at a press conference in Abuja on Wednesday, Faisal Shuaib, NPHCDA director general, said the agency set up the national emergency, maternal and child health intervention centre (NEMCHIC) to provide oversight on maternal and newborn health in Nigeria.  Faisal said the agency also carried out a national health facility assessment in 2022 in a bid to close the gaps of inadequate distribution of human resources at the primary healthcare level.  “Findings from the assessment revealed that only 1.8% (463 out of 25,843) primary health care facilities in our country have the minimum number of required skilled birth attendants (SBA) which is four per facility. Aside from the gross inadequacy, there is the problem of unequal distribution of available SBAs in the PHC facilities,” he said.  Advertisement  He said the agency developed an innovation called community-based health research, innovative training and services program (CRISP) to address the inadequacy.  He said the CRISP will be launched on May 22 at the Banquet Hall of the State House.  “CRISP is a partnership between the teaching hospitals, federal medical centres, NPHCDA, state primary health care boards, local government health authorities and the communities to support primary health care development,” he said.  Advertisement  “The intervention specifically focuses on increasing, retaining and improving the quality, adequacy, competency, and distribution of a committed multidisciplinary primary health care workforce that includes facility outreach and community-based health workers supported through effective management supervision and appropriate compensation.  “CRISP aims to leverage the rural posting of resident doctors from teaching hospitals to boost and guarantee the quality of care at the PHC level through their active involvement in primary health service delivery. This is targeted at improving reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health, amongst other health services within the benefiting communities.  “In addition, human resources for health (HRH), particularly skilled birth attendants, such as medical doctors, midwives, nurses, and community health extension workers (CHEWs) that have been trained on how to manage emergencies would be recruited and deployed to priority PHC facilities across the country.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWNhYmxlLm5nL25waGNkYS1vbmx5LTEtOC1vZi1waGNzLWluLW5pZ2VyaWEtaGF2ZS1yZXF1aXJlZC1za2lsbGVkLWJpcnRoLWF0dGVuZGFudHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"birth","2023-04-01","Not Discerned","{""Vancouver"", ""BritishColumbia"", ""Canada""}","Wed 17 May 2023 18:27:00","In just two days, a clinic in Vancouver received nearly 400 IUD insertion appointments after prescription birth control became publicly funded in BC.  Starting April 1, people in BC were able to receive free prescription contraceptives like copper and hormonal IUDs, which PharmaCare will fully cover.  Before this policy kicked in, Renee Hall, the medical co-director at Willow Clinic in Vancouver, said there was already a high demand for IUDs.  However, this birth control device costs around $400 for people without medical coverage.  So when the intrauterine device became free for British Columbians, “that’s when our phone calls definitely went up, and those who are interested but weren’t able to afford them before, or those who were interested but didn’t like the idea of committing financially to something like that, are now interested in giving it a go,” Hall said. “A lot of people find it really convenient.”  In just two days, the Willow Clinic received about 350 appointment requests and an additional 50 referrals from doctors asking for its help to insert IUDs, Hall said.  By mid-May, Hall said the clinic must have received more than a thousand appointment requests.  “The wait time used to be one to two weeks, and now it’s more in the order of two months,” Hall said. “That’s the part that’s concerning and where we’re raising the alarms.”  Free IUDs in a box are useless without doctors to insert them  Hall explained that over the past few years, there had been an increase in IUD clinics and, “unfortunately,” many doctors and nurse practitioners are dropping the skill of IUD insertion.  She said the reason for the decline of doctors able to insert IUDs is because “It’s not very well remunerated.”  “It is a skill, and it takes time to get trained, and it takes time to master,” she said. “Regardless of how good you are at it, there’s always going to be ones that are difficult. So doctors would find that they are spending a lot of money on the equipment and sterilization of the equipment and not being paid well enough for the insertion.”  “So it started to become more convenient to send them to specialized IUD centres that do it all the time,” Hall said.  However, clinics around the region are reporting demand and long waitlists too.  While it’s “wonderful” to have access to free contraception, “an IUD in a box that’s free is not very useful. We need to be able to have access to the people who insert them,” said Hall.  Hall suggests IUD insertion should be incentivized so more doctors would be willing to train to do it or expand some of those IUD specialized clinics as well, and funding them might help so that women can get the IUD they want when they want.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHloaXZlLmNvbS92YW5jb3V2ZXIvZnJlZS1iaXJ0aC1jb250cm9sLWJjLWl1ZC13YWl0bGlzdNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The girl's counsel said she has achieved a huge amount in relation to motor and cognitive functions “thanks to the exemplary and total care” provided by her parents.  Liam Reidy SC, instructed by Cantillons Solicitors, said the girl’s mother had opted for the Domino Scheme in CUMH, which involves midwife-led care and natural labour and delivery. It was their case that the baby girl suffered a brain injury at birth.  Approving the settlement, which allows for an interim payment for the next five years, Mr Justice Paul Coffey praised the girl’s parents for “the magnificent care they have given her since her birth”.  Advertisement  The girl had, through her mother, sued the HSE. Liability was admitted in the case, but the court heard causation was still in issue.  Interim payment  The €1.35 million payment is for the next five years, at which point the case will come back before the court when her future care needs will be assessed.  The mother attended at CUMH in June 2016 having experienced strong contractions.  She was seen by a midwife, a CTG trace was started, and fetal movements were reported as good. The mother then was transferred to the maternity ward before being moved to the delivery suite.  It was claimed that it was agreed the CTG, which monitors the baby’s heart rate, would be reviewed during the obstetric ward rounds for the early morning shift handover, but it was alleged the review did not take place. When the baby was born later, she was in poor condition.  The girl’s mother told the court the birth of her daughter had been very traumatic as she did not breathe immediately, and she had to have brain cooling treatment for the first four days of her life, which meant they could not hold her. She added an MRI later showed a brain injury.  In the proceedings, it was claimed there was a failure to carry out a requested obstetric review of the CTG trace during a two-hour period on the morning of the delivery when, it was claimed, the CTG trace was unusual or difficult to interpret or when there was a non-reassuring fetal heart rate pattern.

The CTG, it was alleged, had been discontinued on the morning of the delivery when it was claimed it was not reassuring and should have been continued.  It was further claimed there was an alleged failure to expedite the delivery.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyZWFraW5nbmV3cy5pZS9pcmVsYW5kL2dpcmwtc2V0dGxlcy1hY3Rpb24tYWdhaW5zdC1oc2UtZm9yLWUxLTM1bS1vdmVyLWJpcnRoLWF0LWNvcmstaG9zcGl0YWwtMTQ3NzA0MC5odG1s0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnJlYWtpbmduZXdzLmllL2FtcC9pcmVsYW5kL2dpcmwtc2V0dGxlcy1hY3Rpb24tYWdhaW5zdC1oc2UtZm9yLWUxLTM1bS1vdmVyLWJpcnRoLWF0LWNvcmstaG9zcGl0YWwtMTQ3NzA0MC5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"birth","2023-05-13","Not Discerned","{""Springfield"", ""Missouri"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 01:28:31","Imagine that you are covering for a colleague over the weekend, and you get call from a patient.  The patient is a 36-year-old woman who is 3 days postpartum after a spontaneous vaginal delivery. She has a headache and just arrived home after hospital discharge. She's calling because after using the blood pressure cuff that the hospital sent her home with, her reading is > 150/90 mm Hg, indicating that she is hypertensive.  You try to pull up her records but realize her delivery hospital isn't part of your system's electronic health record. What do you do?  This scenario was presented at a session of the annual meeting of the Society of General Internal Medicine during a panel focused on providing care in the fourth trimester as patients transition between ob/gyn care and primary care.  ""If you send her to the emergency room, she might get sent home,"" Chloe Zera, MD, MPH, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, said. ""I would strongly recommend you figure out where she delivered and tell her to go back there because she will almost certainly get readmitted for blood pressure control.""  When stepping in to treat someone who recently gave birth, Zera said that clinicians have to be mindful that though many of the deaths of mothers and infants occur on the day of birth, a substantial proportion occur within the first 6-7 weeks postpartum. Clinicians must be aware of possible complications and ask probing questions if they don't have a patient's medical records at hand.  ""Maternal mortality is a crisis in the United States, which is probably reflective of the sort of social and political realities we're living in right now,"" Zera, an associate professor in obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive biology at Harvard Medical School, said. ""About 700 women die each year in the US from a pregnancy or its complications.""  Zera recommended that clinicians ask about a patient's birth story specifically, at how many weeks they gave birth, what kind of delivery they had, and whether they were they induced for any reason.  ""Everybody's birth story is really important in their lives, people know the details and want to talk about their birth stories,"" she said.  Starting Point  Clinicians should start out by asking questions regarding how the patient delivered but also how much their baby weighed at birth.  ""Both really small and really large babies are associated with later maternal complications,"" Zera said. ""For example, an 8-lb baby at 34 weeks is off the charts while at 42 weeks, that's totally normal.""  Clinicians should also ask about complications prior to the birth, which might include questions regarding high blood pressure, blood sugar concerns, hospitalizations before birth, length of stay for the birth, and whether their infant had a neonatal intensive care stay.  Any of these factors can weigh into adverse pregnancy outcomes. Experiencing a hypertensive pregnancy, for example, can put patients at a higher risk for cardiovascular events, and up to 10% of all pregnancies are complicated by hypertensive disorders.  Women who experience preeclampsia have two to four times the risk for coronary heart disease.  Hypertensive pregnancies can also result in patients developing posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and even producing less milk, according to Ann Celi, MD, MPH, an internal medicine specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital.  More Questions  Celi, who spoke on the panel, runs a clinic that helps people transition back to a primary care provider after a hypertensive pregnancy. She said that she wants to help clinicians better manage the shift.  Clinicians can probe patients on how much sleep they're getting and whether a support system is present back at home. These are all related to the recovery process, and Celi recommended that clinicians encourage their patients to prioritize asking for help from external sources.  ""Bring in your community: 'Do you have some best friends from work or somebody who might be able to help with meals? Is there someone in the family that could travel to help [you] as [you're] recovering? Is the father of the baby involved? Can they help?'"" Celi, offering question suggestions for clinicians to ask, said.  Celi also recommended that clinicians prescribe hypertensive-friendly birth control options as part of a follow-up care plan, such as progestin-only birth control pills.  They also recommend that clinicians evaluate women with a history of preeclampsia 3-6 months after a birth for cardiovascular risk factors, with an annual follow-up on blood pressure, body mass index, fasting glucose or A1c, and lipids.  Follow-Up Care  ""At least 40% of people don't even make it to that 6-week visit, and we lose them,"" Zera said. ""It turns out, having a pregnancy complication does not make it any more likely that you're going to come to your postpartum visit.""  For some patients, insurance coverage often changes after delivery. For example, in states without a Medicaid extension or expansion, the program is only required to provide 60 days of coverage after delivery. Even among patients with commercial insurance, churn rates are high. People may quit their jobs and switch to their partner's insurance or get a new job with a different insurance plan. If the new insurance doesn't include the patient's established clinician, they may switch clinicians or skip the follow-up appointment entirely.  Another barrier to care is patients feeling like their doctors don't care about them, Zera said.  ""This is kind of simple stuff, but bond with your patients,"" she said. ""Tell them, 'I want to see you when you're pregnant and beyond,' because that makes a huge difference.""  No relevant financial relationships were reported.

File photo: Shutterstock  DAB lawmaker Nixie Lam says the government could put more effort into helping citizens reproduce, claiming that it takes too long for women to get fertility treatments in the public health system.    During a question and answer session in the Legislative Council on Wednesday, concerns were raised over the high cost of treatments, such as IVF, in the private sector.    Lam, who says she paid over HK$200,000 for IVF treatment and is now 32 weeks pregnant, told RTHK it can take 18 months in the public sector before a couple can even see a doctor.    ""In Hong Kong, it's likely that you will be in your mid-30s before you're ready to have a baby,"" she said. ""The timing is basically delayed for women because there is a focus on career, and then finding a partner and getting married. ""    ""However, a lot of other countries do more to help couples. I think there could be policies to support women to have better flexibility on their decisions, and early education – in their 20s – to have body checks to make sure that their bodies are OK.""    Lam said it was ""unfortunate"" that the government had indicated it wouldn't ""intervene"" in family planning, adding that for women who seek help with fertility, the public system is too slow to help.    ""If you go to a private clinic, you don't have to wait for IVF,"" she said. ""You can meet your doctors immediately. But in public hospitals, you'll have to wait 18 months to see a doctor to begin with. That wait lowers your chance of having a baby. We need to see whether we can cut the lines.    ""There are also too many forms and unnecessary data that the government is harvesting, which prolongs the process.""

A new Southern Cross University study is seeking midwives for an online survey to understand how their own experience of a personal birth trauma impacts returning to the maternity workplace.  Lead researcher is PhD candidate Lisa Charmer, who is a registered midwife and course coordinator for the Bachelor of Midwifery at Southern Cross University. Her PhD research is entitled Exploring Midwives’ Experience of Primary Birth Trauma.  “There is acknowledgement of the impact of secondary trauma on midwives working with women who have less than an ideal birth,” said Ms Charmer.  “However, when her own baby’s birth is traumatic, very little is known about the impact on midwives’ general health and mental wellbeing as well as on her professional quality of life.”  Primary birth trauma is any perceived trauma experienced by a woman during the birth of her baby that lasts longer than the experience.  “Knowing that secondary trauma impacts at the level of the individual – in this case, midwives – the organisation and society, one can presume there may also be implications when it’s personal birth trauma,” Ms Charmer said.  “The study will investigate what support is offered to midwives who have experienced their own birth trauma and are returning to the maternity workplace.”  Ms Charmer noted that last year Safe Work Australia released a new code of practice that means employers need to protect workers’ mental health.  Study details  This research seeks to understand if having experienced birth trauma does, or does not, impact midwives’ professional quality of life and well-being.

Hayden Hoskins was born with an omphalocele. Part of Hoskins’s organs formed on the outside of his abdomen in utero.  An omphalocele affects one in every 5,300 newborns. Hoskins’s parents found out their baby had one during a routine ultrasound.  Andy and Kelsea Hoskins traveled from Quincy, Illinois, to Barnes Jewish and Children’s Hospital in St. Louis because the hospitals have a national reputation for treating omphalocele babies. Our cameras were in the delivery room when Hayden was born.  Doctors and his parents wouldn’t know if the birth defect had affected his breathing until he was born. Hayden went to the NICU at Children’s Hospital, where he needed a little help breathing. He would spend the next five and a half months at home, living with the large growth attached to his stomach area.  Most babies must wait about a month to have corrective surgery, but Hayden was ready early. He had corrective surgery to have his sack of organs put back into his abdomen. Doctors told his parents that their son would grow up to be just like other boys his age and shouldn’t suffer any lasting health effects. They told Andy and Kelsea he could have an issue with hernias at some point, but he’s had no problems since his surgery.  FOX 2 caught up with Hayden and his family for the first time since he was born 10 years ago when he traveled to St. Charles recently for a youth soccer game. Hayden has grown into the picture of a healthy 10-year-old. He is a great soccer and hockey player. He loves to mountain bike. He’s so smart, he even skipped a grade in school. Hayden speaks about his condition as a baby very casually.  The only reminders he has are a scar on his stomach and a recording of FOX 2’s story on his complicated birth. He and his family watch the video each year on his birthday. Andy and Kelsea said it was a way to remind them how far they’ve come over the last 10 years and how grateful they are.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vZm94Mm5vdy5jb20vbmV3cy9pbGxpbm9pcy9mb3gtMi1jYXRjaGVzLXVwLXdpdGgtYmFieS1ib3JuLXdpdGgtb3JnYW5zLW9uLW91dHNpZGUv0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly9mb3gybm93LmNvbS9uZXdzL2lsbGlub2lzL2ZveC0yLWNhdGNoZXMtdXAtd2l0aC1iYWJ5LWJvcm4td2l0aC1vcmdhbnMtb24tb3V0c2lkZS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"birth","2012-07-25","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 08:39:48","A city of 90,000 in southern Germany is an epicentre of innovation in the artificial intelligence space. It’s also the birthplace of a company that is moving the needle when it comes to plant breeders using it.  It takes special people to give birth to a business in the plant breeding and bioinformatics space, but it takes a special city to inspire those people in the first place.  “The city of Tübingen in southwestern Germany is that very place. Located on the banks of the river Neckar in the Stuttgart region, it has always been a unique spot to live and work, enjoying a small community feel while being home to many highly skilled and knowledgeable people in the scientific field”, says Daniel Huson, professor of algorithms in bioinformatics at the University of Tübingen and member of the scientific advisory board of Computomics.  Its history has everything to do with its status as the Silicon Valley of Germany. Over the centuries, as Tübingen grew and developed, it became a center of trade and commerce, as well as an important academic and cultural hub. In the 15th and 16th centuries, the city experienced major growth and prosperity, with the construction of many important buildings and landmarks that can still be seen today.  It’s now home to Cyber Valley, Europe’s largest research consortium in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) with partners from science and industry. Bringing together academic and corporate expertise in artificial intelligence and machine learning, the community-oriented environment in Tübingen allows for both professional and personal relationships with colleagues.  It’s where Computomics was born in 2012, and where the revolution in machine learning for the plant breeding sector was started.  Ahead of the Curve  Let’s rewind to 2002. Tübingen’s academic programs, particularly in bioinformatics, have always been ahead of the curve, and the influx of students due to the biotech boom led to strong student numbers. At that time (and it’s still the case), the city did not have a dominant large company that stood over everyone else. “That lack of a physical and intellectual monopoly fosters an open and innovative atmosphere that encourages entrepreneurship”, says Sebastian Schultheiss, Managing Director of Computomics.  The core group of Computomics founders — numbering six in total, including Schultheiss and Huson — found themselves working together on campus at the University of Tübingen and the Max Planck Campus.  “We recognized that the emerging field of genomics and the vast amounts of data generated by modern sequencing technologies could provide valuable insights into the genetic basis of plant traits, such as yield, disease resistance and nutritional quality,” Schultheiss says. “So, Computomics was formed with the aim of applying cutting-edge computational methods to solve problems in plant breeding and genomics.”  At the time, plant breeders analyzing these massive data sets needed sophisticated computational tools and expertise to do so, and these were lacking in many plant breeding programs.  The Computomics founders had a vision to bridge this gap by providing state-of-the-art bioinformatics and computational biology services to plant breeding programs, helping them to leverage the power of genomics for crop improvement.  “Of course, no company sees success overnight. The challenge of securing funding and acquiring customers while building the business was real,” Schultheiss says.  Computomics was able to grow with the help of stipends and other support to get things off the ground. The company grew by exploring plant breeding as a potential area of focus and establishing a long-term partnership to learn from customers’ needs and improve their product. The team received public funding to support their development and data analysis efforts, which are crucial to bioinformatics due to the large datasets involved.  As the founders worked to build the company, which officially opened its doors in 2012 as a spin-off from the Max Planck Institute for Biology and the University of Tübingen, their technology and expertise attracted major players in the plant breeding and seed industry.  Computomics co-founder Sebastian Schultheiss builds a lightwall in the early days of the company.  In 2016 Computomics introduced their groundbreaking machine learning technology xSeedScore®, which allows seed companies to optimize traits like yield, flavor, texture and shelf life while offering the ability to improve crops and provide supply chain continuity as crops can be adapted for multiple locations and future climates.  “Tübingen remains the heart of Computomics as a company, and the home of its data center. With the experience of more than 180 successfully completed projects for customers in 18 countries, Computomics helps navigate the complexities of all crops,” Schultheiss says.  Their advanced machine learning methods enable rapid understanding of genomic data for researchers including those in the plant breeding and seed spaces, he adds.  The Rise of Artificial Intelligence  Right now, AI is on a lot of people’s minds as chatbots grab headlines all over the world. It’s important to note that AI and Tübingen have been intimately linked for years. The Cyber Valley initiative was launched in 2016, with the aim of advancing research in AI and machine learning, as well as promoting the transfer of knowledge and technology from academia to industry.  Computomics technology is a great example of how AI can be used to benefit all mankind.  The initiative is based on a collaboration between the University of Tübingen, the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, and the University of Stuttgart. “Because Tübingen allows for both professional and personal relationships with colleagues, it’s a prime location for AI researchers and companies to establish themselves”, Huson notes.  This has led to the emergence of many innovative AI companies in the area, with Computomics being one of the first AI companies founded a few years before the establishment of the Cyber Valley.  AI systems can be trained on large datasets to learn patterns and make predictions or decisions based on that data. There are different types, including machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics, and they are being used in a wide range of applications, from virtual assistants and self-driving cars to medical diagnosis, financial forecasting, and in the agricultural space.  When applied to plant breeding, AI can save breeders both time and resources by more precisely identifying the elite genetics to test in the field. AI can capture genetically what would take breeders multiple cycles of selection and large expenditure of resources to achieve.  AI has the capability when applied with discipline and focus to both increase the efficiency and the genetic gain of a breeders pipeline.  The machine learning technology xSeedScore analyzes massive amounts of genomic data, allowing plant breeders to select the best plant traits for desired outcomes such as yield, flavor, texture and shelf life. This technology helps to speed up the plant breeding process by allowing breeders to identify the best genetic combinations for a specific trait and select plants for crossbreeding.  It is a modern use of technology that has been in development in Tübingen for a long time and which will only accelerate as time goes on. Computomics technology is a great example of how AI can be used to benefit all mankind.  —Sebastian Schultheiss and Daniel Huson are pioneers in the field of bioinformatics and co-founders of Computomics.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlZWR3b3JsZC5jb20vaG93LWdlcm1hbnlzLXNpbGljb24tdmFsbGV5LWdhdmUtYmlydGgtdG8tYS1iaW9pbmZvcm1hdGljcy1yZXZvbHV0aW9uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

With the sighting of T-4 with four cubs and translocation of two big cats on cards, there would be new challenges before the NNTR management, honorary wildlife warden Sawan Bahekar said.  The authorities have to ensure protection of the cubs and also regularly monitor movement of the two new felines to be released in the reserve, he said.  ''There may be some conflict situation and natural threats. The management also requires to make efforts to prevent any man-made threat for the felines. It would also have to be ensured that the tigers stay inside the core areas and do not move out often,"" Bahekar said.

The Loose Women star, 64, is a proud mum to 1975 frontman Matty Healy, 34, and her younger son, Louis, 22.  The former Coronation Street star has long been open about her battle with her inner demons, but she has now given more insight than ever into how she first dealt with her very first panic attack which came out of nowhere just days after she gave birth to Matty back in 1989.  After enjoying a peaceful and problem-free pregnancy with her first child, things took a turn for the worst for Denise on one random day when everything appeared to build up and emerge in the form of a panic-attack which left the new mum feeling as though she was dying.

Alongside a sweet throwback snap of her and her famous son Matty, Denise penned: ""This is 2 days before Matty was born, April 1989. Happy, excited, nervous. I had a brilliant pregnancy and wasn't even bothered when he was 9 days late.  ""Long labour but he was a healthy 8lbs and we were thrilled with our beautiful boy. I wasn't anxious. I loved the first few days even though he cried a lot.  ""A week later out of nowhere, during a walk with my mum, my life changed forever.

Denise went on to further share her experiences with post-natal depression as she penned: "" Post-natal depression robbed me of any joy for months. I felt nothing. The GP was terrible and knew nothing.  ""I tried for 20 years to get someone to listen to me that I felt my illness was hormonal. No one really helped me.  ""Years of good days and bad days followed. Several 'nervous breakdowns' as we called them and every antidepressant known to man, which undoubtedly did help for sure.

The Loose Women star concluded by urging her followers who may find themselves in the same position as she once was to 'reach out'.  ""We have HRT and it's our right to be given it.

By age 30, fertility, ability to get pregnant, begins to decline.  “This decline happens faster once you reach your mid-30s. By 45, fertility has declined so much that getting pregnant naturally is unlikely, Dr. Mrs. Hanson stated.  She recommended that all things being equal, women should give birth, “not too early or too late as they all have their respective complications.”  “Women should also consider proper spacing children,” she said, and stressed that women should consider giving birth before their 30th birthday.  Dr. Hansen said giving birth at a young age is better; nonetheless, the interval between children was crucial.  Dr. Hanson made the remarks at the weekly “Your Health! Our Collective Responsibility,” a Ghana News Agency Tema Regional Office initiative aimed at promoting health-related communication and providing a platform for health information dissemination to influence personal health choices through improved health literacy.  The Tema Regional Office of the Ghana News Agency launched the public health advocacy platform “Your Health! Our Collective Responsibility” to examine the components of four health communication approaches: informing, instructing, persuading, and promoting.  She suggested that spacing the birth of children between the ages of two and four years is ideal when the body had recovered from the previous delivery and was ready for another.  She said the body reacted to giving birth as if it were the first time after a four-year interval.  The IMaH Medical Officer advised married couples to evaluate their financial and personal circumstances because some women had conditions that required them to limit births due to the high risk of mortality.  Dr. Mrs. Hanson recommended that young people marry early because giving birth early frequently allowed them to achieve the body stature, they desired and live life more fully.  Contributing to the discussion, Mr. Samuel Atuahene Antwi, Nutritionist Officer at Tema Metropolitan Health Directorate, said the reproductive system of women in their younger years produces quality eggs.  He said women’s reproductive lifespan evolved within the menstrual cycle period; nevertheless, the fertility of eggs produced at ages 18 and up was of higher quality than eggs produced at ages 30 and up.  Mr. Antwi also believed that giving birth at a young age was easier than giving birth at an older age when the woman and newborn were more likely to have abnormalities.  According to the Nutritionist, as individuals become older, they lose interest in many things. early parenthood stimulates young couples since they have the energy to take care of their children’s development.

I was referred by the NHS for postnatal depression, but throughout that time no psychological support came through from British Cycling,” she says.  Fachie, who is aiming to make it to the Cycling World Championships in Glasgow alongside husband and fellow Paralympian Neil Fachie this summer, expressed her frustration that British Cycling had not gone beyond the UK Sport guidelines and offered more personal care.  “It’s little things. You’re there to win medals, and if you’re not winning medals you’re just a number. These last few months have been a real reminder that on a personal level they couldn’t care less about you.”  When approached for comment, British Cycling maintained that the wellbeing of their riders is their “number one priority”. British Cycling performance director Stephen Park CBE said: “Our coaching and wider support teams have been working incredibly closely with Lora, and are now supporting her with a collaborative and progressive return to full training.  “Riders are regularly reminded of the additional mental health and medical support available to them if required. We will continue to listen to Lora and others to understand where we can further strengthen the support we offer.”  UK Sport also reiterated their commitment to supporting mothers “both on and off the field of play” in wake of Fachie’s experience, and announced that they will be publishing updated guidelines later this summer.  “The publication of our pregnancy guidance was an important step forward, and so far 13 athletes from 12 sports have been supported through their pregnancy,” said UK Sport CEO Sally Munday. “We are determined to continue to drive forward progress on equality and power a diverse and inclusive Olympic and Paralympic family.”  ‘Women don’t want an advantage, just a chance’  Clarisse Crémer is no stranger to the obstacles faced by athletes after having children. The French sailor, who is the fastest woman to sail solo around the world, was dropped by her sponsor, Banque Populaire, ahead of the 2024 Vendée Globe – a sailing race so tough it has been dubbed ‘the Everest of the seas’ – after giving birth last year. Banque Populaire insisted that sponsoring Crémer was too big a risk after a change in qualification rules for the race put her at a disadvantage due to her time away from sailing.  Crémer believes the underlying issue is that women are seen as incapable of having both a demanding career and a child. “Becoming a mother is not a disease, it's not a wound,” she laughs. “There's a lot of work to be done on the perception of what it is to have a baby and to have ambitious careers as well. For some people it’s quite normal that a woman has to choose [between the two], and that has to improve.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbGVncmFwaC5jby51ay93b21lbnMtc3BvcnQvMjAyMy8wNS8xNy9tb3RoZXJzLWJlaW5nLWxldC1kb3duLW9uLXJldHVybi10by1zcG9ydC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Green made the announcement on Tuesday during his contribution to the 2023/24 Sectoral Debate in the House of Representatives.  He said the Registrar General’s Department (RGD) is moving to make this a reality soon.  “I have continued to advocate for and ensure the inclusion of our most vulnerable in all that we do.

This is to be executed through partnerships with Jamaica Council for Persons with Disabilities, Jamaica Society for the Blind and other relevant stakeholders,” Green said.  “This is a pioneering effort within the English-speaking Caribbean,” he added.  Meanwhile, Green updated the House on the Government's Operation BirthRight programme which is aimed at providing up to 30,000 undocumented, minimum wage-earning Jamaicans with a birth certificate. He said over 2,000 applicants have so far submitted applications for birth certificates under the programme.  “We have also partnered with the Department of Correctional Services to provide close to 100 birth certificates for inmates at the St Catherine Adult Correctional Centre; a programme which will extend over the next coming months to other correctional centres islandwide,” Green said.  He noted that determining whether the applicants are eligible for Jamaican birth certificates is an involved process and, in some cases, consists of obtaining information from applicants’ schools, churches and communities.  Green said the RGD conducting fieldwork and follow-ups to advance the late registration and entries required to issue birth certificates to eligible applicants. He also disclosed that an additional 14 people have been employed across the island to treat specifically with Operation Birthright.  The minister anticipates that the production of birth certificates will be ramped up this year.  “Last month we started a promotional campaign and will continue that drive for the next few months.

Loading the player...  CNN’s René Marsh has a new source of hope in her life.  Two years after the death of her 2-year-old son Blake to brain cancer, the CNN national correspondent has given birth to a baby girl. Marsh told People magazine her daughter Siena, born last month, “has, and forever will, serve as a reminder of hope.”  “I felt happy to be able to have this chance again to be a mom again,” said the journalist. “And it was finally happening for us, the fact that I was pregnant again gave me hope. It gave me something to look forward to that was positive. This pregnancy really renewed my spirit of hope.”  René Marsh appears on CNN’s “New Day.” (Photo credit: CNN screenshot)  Marsh was still deeply grieving the loss of her son while pregnant, experiencing a “constant tug and pull” between a mix of emotions. Her daughter’s movement in the womb particularly impacted her.  “Through the tears, her gentle and sometimes not-so-gentle kicks in the womb reminded me more was on the horizon,” Marsh explained. “I will tell her one day how her kicks gave me hope at a time of great heartbreak.”  The tears returned the day Siena was born; reflecting on the magnitude of pushing through her grief to make it to motherhood for a second time, Marsh said she felt accomplished.  “I think that’s where the tears were coming from, and there were tears of relief, there were tears of happiness, but there were also tears of reflection of just all the battered, bruised journey that I had taken to get to this point,” she said.  Marsh is using self-reflection to continue her healing process.  “It’s important to take a self-assessment of what you have been able to endure so far, even if you’re still enduring it, and give yourself a pat on the back, that reflection is important,” she said.  Marsh also intends to keep mothering both of her children, saying parenting daughter Siena will be “traditional” since she has her in the physical sense, but she will also continue to “mother” Blake through her work and activism. She recently partnered with the Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation and has released a children’s book in Blake’s honor, with 100% of the proceeds benefitting pediatric brain cancer research.  “I’ll never get over the loss of my son,” Marsh said. “But now I have the love of my daughter to at least give me the balance that I was lacking before she got here.”  TheGrio is FREE on your TV via Apple TV, Amazon Fire, Roku, and Android TV.

In an interview with TVBS News Network, Wang said he was by his wife’s side during the delivery and even helped cut the umbilical cord.  The 40-year-old also revealed that he had asked a hospital staff member to pack the umbilical cord and placenta, so he could refrigerate it and cook it at home for his wife.  Wang said he made the decision after hearing that consuming the placenta can provide important micronutrients such as iron, increase milk production and beautify one’s face.  On Sunday (May 14), the Intern Doctor star posted an Instagram Reel demonstrating how he cooked the dish.  In the video, Wang can be seen boiling the placenta and umbilical cord in a pot before frying them them with onions, ginger and pepper.  “This is my first time eating human flesh. I was initially very nervous when I took my first bite.  “It tastes a little like pork liver but also pork belly and intestines. The taste is pretty average,” he told TVBS News Network.  Meanwhile, Cindy said she enjoyed the dish and that the placenta was “delicious and crunchy”.  Placenta eating has been a popular trend worldwide, with many celebrities encapsulating, blending and cooking their placenta for rumoured health benefits.  Among the big names who ate their placenta include Kim Kardashian, Chrissy Teigen, Alicia Silverstone and Hilary Duff.  Despite the trend, experts at Mayo Clinic – a nonprofit organisation committed to clinical practice, education and research – say there’s no evidence that eating the placenta provides health benefits.  Last December, registered dietitian and founder of Dietitian Fit & Co Karine Patel told Reader’s Digest that ingesting placenta increases the risk of group B Streptococcus infection.  “This can be a serious and sometimes fatal infection for both the mother and baby. Even if the placenta is cooked, it doesn’t completely destroy infectious bacteria and viruses that the placenta may have.  “A mother who got infected by the group B streptococcus infection after consuming infected placenta pills passed on the infection to her newborn by breastfeeding the baby,” she said.  In 2017, the Centers For Disease Control And Prevention (CDC) issued a warning against placenta ingestion following a case in which a newborn developed group B streptococcus after the mother took contaminated placenta pills.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vYXNpYW5ld3MubmV0d29yay90YWl3YW5lc2UtYW1lcmljYW4tYWN0b3ItYmVuamktd2FuZ3Mtd2lmZS1lYXRzLWhlci1vd24tcGxhY2VudGEtZm9sbG93aW5nLWJpcnRoLW9mLWRhdWdodGVyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

My guest today is Hugo Hopenhayn, an economist at UCLA and long-term consultant with the Richmond Fed's Research department. Hugo, welcome to the show.  Hugo Hopenhayn: Thank you. It's a pleasure to be here.  Sablik: We're recording this episode in March 2023, and I'm excited to talk to you about some of your research in the areas of innovation and firm dynamics, as well as about a conference you're organizing here at Richmond in May on innovation.  Most people who have had some exposure to economics have probably heard of ""creative destruction,"" a term typically attributed to Austrian-born economist Joseph Schumpeter. It refers to the process by which old, inefficient businesses fail and are replaced by newer, more productive firms. This process is considered a cornerstone of capitalism, but I suspect that most people don't give it a lot of daily thought.  You've spent much of your career as an economist studying firm dynamics — this process of firms entering and exiting the market. Why are you so interested in it?  Hopenhayn: As social scientists, we see facts and we want to think of what might be explaining these facts. Firms are born. Some of them die very young. Some of them survive, grow over time [and] eventually die. There is this process in which there's survival and death.  The process of firm creation and destruction, and the process of firm growth and shrinkage, involves the reallocation of resources — a very large reallocation of resources. Labor is reallocated from shrinking firms to growing firms, from exiting firms to firms that are newly created. Capital is relocated, too — the order of magnitude of this capital relocation is perhaps as large as the creation of new capital.  So, is this reallocation good? Does it contribute to the well functioning of the economy? Well, that's part of what the Schumpeterians had in mind — that behind this process of creative destruction is somewhat of a process of natural selection, where this job reallocation will reallocate talent and resources from less to more valuable activities.  Sablik: Mm-hmm.  Hopenhayn: It's this process of reallocation that makes the economy good and function well and be able to progress. So, that's the economic reason for thinking about this.  In terms of the creation and destruction mechanisms, you can think, well, why are some firms not able to survive? Why are some firms not able to grow? There might be many reasons behind this.  One reason might be that firms are not able to keep up with progress. As the world is changing, as new technologies appear [and] as new needs appear, firms might not be able to adapt. Firms that are not able to adapt to the new environment are likely to not succeed and exit.  The other reason might be the displacement by new firms. This is something I think was central to the idea of creative destruction. New firms, in some ways, are displacing existing firms.  The specific way in which this creative destruction takes place is important. If you're creating a completely new activity, that might not displace directly any resources from other firms. But at the end of the day, you need resources. If you're creating a new activity, you're going to need workers, you're going to need equipment and so on. Indirectly that is going to be competing for resources with other firms. At the other extreme, a firm may come and basically displace completely one other firm that was the leading firm in that particular activity. By doing that, it's adding some new value. But at the same time, there's another force which is taking away value from the firm that exits.  While these resource reallocations might be good from the efficiency point of view, not everything is perfect. There might be reasons why creative destruction might generate some sources of inefficiencies. Even though it might contribute to this reallocation, it might do it [while] burning some value that was created by other firms. The anticipation of that burning of value might affect those firms in decisions to innovate to begin with.  Sablik: Right. As you mentioned, this reallocation process can be a bit messy sometimes. It can be particularly painful for workers at firms that fail and lose their jobs. A number of countries have adopted policies to help with that transition process, to help protect workers who lose their jobs through no fault of their own.  A 1993 paper that you wrote with Richard Rogerson in the Journal of Political Economy explored this issue of how interfering with the job destruction process can have an impact on the overall efficiency of the labor market. Can you talk a bit more about those findings of that paper and the legacy of that work today?  Hopenhayn: Sure. Just to focus on that particular kind of policy, this is like a tax on firing. A tax on firing one might think protects the workers that are currently in been in the firm. And that is right in some ways. But one has to understand that a tax on firing has implications for hiring. In anticipation of the fact that if you were to downsize in the future you're going to have to pay these taxes, firms are going to hire less.  Beyond that, there is the impact that these policies have on overall productivity. Presumably, if the reallocation of resources is healthy, it's going to be a reallocation that goes from less to more productive or less or more valuable activities. So, taxing reallocation is somehow curtailing the efficiency of this movement of resources. As a consequence, it's going to slow down progress. It's going to reduce the overall productivity in the economy.  Sablik: Mm-hmm.  Hopenhayn: Now, the question of protecting workers is a serious one, especially in the event of large displacements that could happen because there are big reforms — lowering tariff barriers, privatizations and so on — which are very common in less developed countries. This could lead to very large employment losses. The question is what is the best mechanism to cope with that. In this process of creative destruction, there [are] winners and losers and there are people that can lose a lot. We would like to be able to provide some kind of protection and insurance.  Unemployment insurance is an institution that is fairly common in more developed economies, but it's less prevalent in less developed economies. I'm an advocate of those kinds of policies, properly designed. It's understood that unemployment insurance could also generate some distortions.  Sablik: In recent years, there's also been some growing concern about an overall slowdown in business dynamics. Firm entry and exit rates have been falling since the 1970s. This is something that you've also been looking into and researching, particularly looking at how [business dynamics] connects to demographics. What did you find in that research?  Hopenhayn: These demographic changes in the U.S. economy have been tremendous. Around the mid-'70s, the labor force was growing at a rate of 2.5 percent per year. Nowadays, it's growing at 0.5 percent. It's hard to understand what are the implications of these changes. There's lots of research that is concerned with this.  When we think about firm creation, when a firm creates, it's going to need to take its resources from somewhere. Part of where it takes them is from existing firms. But also new resources are added constantly to the economy in terms of labor, which is one of the most important resources, by the introduction [of workers] or the growth in the labor force — basically, new people entering the labor force.  If there's a slowdown in the growth of the labor force, there's a slowdown in these resources that are made available for the creation of new firms and for the expansion of existing firms. What we see in the data is that the incentives for firm creation are affected negatively by this decrease in the rate of growth of [the] labor force. So these demographic forces have a first impact — less people are born, less firms are born.  Another side of the story is that firms are going to be created and firms are going to expand if demand grows. Part of the growth in demand is the increase in population. If population increase is slowing down, then that contribution of that additional source of demand growth is diminished.  In the same way that we think about populations having demographics and populations aging, firms also have demographics. So, in any population where births are going down, that population will age. In the same way that the population of people is aging, the population of firms is also aging. What implications does this have [for] questions such as the extent of reallocation, perhaps innovation? What implications does this have on concentration?  What our paper tried to do is try to account [for] how much of the rise in average firm size, how much of the decrease in entry rates, how much of the decrease in exit rates — the turnover of firms — [and] how much of the decrease in reallocation between shrinking and expanding firms is affected by these demographic forces. We find that it's a very large fraction.  In terms of the implications for the economy, it's unclear. If you think that [firm] entry is contributing to growth by bringing in new ideas and so on, that might be worrisome. Perhaps part of the slowdown in productivity has to do with this. But all of these trends are not showing that the economy is not working well. No, the economy is responding in a natural way to the changes in demographics.  Sablik: Yeah. As you mentioned, the creation and destruction of firms matters a lot for the overall productivity of the economy, and the productivity of individual firms matters for the aggregate. You've explored how frictions like the misallocation of resources also influences productivity. Can you talk about your findings and how they help improve our understanding of the drivers of economic growth?  Hopenhayn: These issues that you're talking about are of the most concern with less developed economies. There is a very important question in economics, which is trying to understand the big disparities that we see in income per capita across countries in the world — much larger than the disparities that we see within developed countries.  One of the leading explanations of this is the aggregate level of productivity of less developed countries is the principal driver. Obviously, there are differences in their human capital and also their physical capital. Their resources are not the same. But it's not only the resources. [It's] how these resources are put together that make these economies much less productive. And so, creative destruction and the reallocation of resources to their most productive uses, in some ways, will determine the productivity of an economy beyond the resources it has.  One of the prevailing views of explaining under development is that these distortions might be much more important in some less developed countries. There are many policies that affect this. One I referred to before was these labor firing taxes. But any distortions that are affecting this process of reallocation will definitely have consequences over productivity.  There [are] other policies that are quite common. The cost of creating a business differs a lot across countries. If you have very high costs of creating business, you're taxing the creation of firms, which will also lead to less destruction of firms. But that reduction of the creation and destruction of firms will reduce the reallocation which is, in principle, a healthy reallocation and as a consequence will have effects on aggregate productivity.  There [are] also incentives for innovation. If resources are not well allocated, that might increase the cost of innovation. Firms below a certain size in many countries, including France, are exempt from some labor taxes.  Or, in less developed countries — perhaps because of the high cost of creating firms — there are many [of] what [are] called informal firms, which are firms that don't comply with any of the regulations and are not paying any of these taxes. The more successful firms, which are the formal firms, are paying these taxes [and] the other ones are not.  You might think that some of this should exist in order to promote a fair economy. They do have a cost in the sense that they there are a tax on being successful. If you have a tax on being successful, that's going to also decrease the incentives to be successful. That decrease in the incentives might imply that firms are more reluctant to invest in innovation and in activities that enhance value. As you reduce the value of firms, you're going to reduce the aggregate productivity.  Sablik: Yeah. Thinking about policies that are designed to encourage innovation at firms, I mentioned at the beginning of the conversation you're organizing this conference at Richmond in May about innovation. What are you hoping to learn there? What are the big questions in this space that economists are researching?  Hopenhayn: I would say the conference is really not only about innovation. It's more about the intersection of networks, innovation and productivity growth.  Lots of papers are exploring the role of inter-firm linkages for productivity. This can happen in different ways. For example, trade economists are interested in the fact that lowering barriers to trade, lowering tariffs, allows firms to search among a larger set of potential providers of inputs.  Another form of interconnection, which is not necessarily between firms that are [in] a supplier-buyer relationship, is between firms in the idea space. When a start-up is thinking about a new idea, a lot of the thinking about a new source of value is inspired by opportunities that it sees from existing technologies or advances in technology. Innovation breeds innovation. There [are] these feedbacks and these linkages that we are interested in understanding better.  One of the forces that is behind growth is not just knowledge creation, but also knowledge diffusion. How does this knowledge diffuse? It diffuses by perhaps observing others that are acquiring and changing their practices. This is something that carries through the rest of the economy. Part of the selection of papers at this conference is also trying to give some light on this.  Sablik: Sticking with the theme of innovation, this conference is part of the Richmond Fed's CORE Week model, which is an innovation that the Research department here adopted after the pandemic as a way to bring economists together, originally virtually and now in person, for seminars and conferences.  You've been quite involved and have attended several CORE Weeks. What do you find valuable about that process?  Hopenhayn: Let me first start [by] saying that the process that is going on here is not unique. It's perhaps quite unique compared to other Federal Reserve Banks.  At UCLA, for instance, every area used to have their seminar. You invite somebody, you hang out with them, maybe some students also hang out with them. And it's a whole day — you go to dinner at night — so there's a lot of informal information exchange plus the paper they present.  A lot [of economists] have been saying instead of doing that you do, monthly, a mini conference where you bring four people and you have a whole day. During that day, you have these presentations of the same length of time that you would have had if people would come every week, but you're concentrating them in one day. So, it's similar to what's happening [during] CORE Weeks.  CORE Weeks concentrate both researchers from inside the Richmond Fed [and] researchers that come from outside — visitors, speakers. It's a critical mass, a very large critical mass. Rather than having these activities distributed evenly over time, you have these weeks where you get this large scale effect. Obviously, this is exploiting, in some ways, economies of scale in knowledge, knowledge creation in the future, right, as we were talking about before.  When I go to a seminar, I learn from the speaker. But you learn almost as much from the questions that are being asked from the people that are there. People are highly energized — speakers sometime start laughing because they get so many questions that they think they're not going to be able to finish.  Sablik: Hugo, thank you so much for coming on to talk with me today.  Hopenhayn: I appreciate the opportunity.  Sablik: I'll remind listeners, as always, that you can head over to the show page for links to Hugo's papers that we discussed today.

Content creator Bramty Juliette revealed that she wanted her husband and her mom around when she was welcoming her firstborn into this world. However, things didn’t go quite according to plan. The woman opened up about her experience on a podcast she co-hosts with her husband, the snippet of which was later uploaded on her TikTok account. Scroll down to find the video below.  In their viral video, content creator Bramty Juliette discussed her first childbirth experience with her husband  Image credits: nd3000  “The reason why I really didn’t like your mom back then”  Image credits: bramty  “I was giving birth to Penelope and I let his mom be in the room to watch me give birth, which was also a huge issue. ‘I don’t want your mom in the room. I only want you. I only want you and my mom in the room, you’re my husband, and my mom for emotional support.’ And he’s said, ‘I want my mom in the room.'”  “No, it’s not about you. It’s my mom, like, I want her in the room”  Image credits: bramty  “‘No, it’s not about you.’ And he didn’t really understand. She’s the one giving birth. And that wasn’t the case”  “When you give birth, it’s about the wife. She’s the one going through things physically, mentally”  Image credits: bramty  “At the moment, like my water breaks, I go to the hospital and it’s my first time giving birth. I’m 19 years old. I’m having contractions. I remember having contractions. And I was like, I’m gonna do birth without an epidural. So I try to push it through as long as I could. And at the time, I was just so focused on, my contractions.”  “We had my mom, you, your mom, your brother, and your aunt who I never spoke to in my whole life in the room, watching my birth”  Image credits: bramty  “Interviewer: ‘Cause it’s Cuban people. They just want to be, involved and think everything’s fine. Nothing’s taboo, everything’s fine.’  He should have had my back then. You should have had my back then. ‘All right, Bramty, you’re about to give birth. Everybody out. Only what my wife wants.’ But you didn’t have that mentality and you just had your mom’s back most of the time. So I remember I just wasn’t even involved with, who was in the room. I remember pushing.”  “I remember your mom and your aunt taking pictures of my vagina while I am pushing, then later finding out that your aunt had sent those pictures to family members”  Bramty’s TikTok video attracted over five million views  Having loved ones around during childbirth can make it a more positive experience  Image credits: Jonathan Borba (not the actual photo)  Bramty shared her story of giving birth on the newly-released BRAMTEA podcast that she hosts together with her husband Luis Espina. Previously known from their YouTube channel, titled The Bramfam, the couple discussed how—as Bramty stated in her video description—her mother-in-law ruined her childbirth experience.  The woman said she wanted her husband and her mother to be there in the room with her, which is not an unusual request. The World Health Organization (WHO) emphasized that support coming from the people the expectant mother trusts can help make labor and childbirth a more positive experience. The loved ones can aid her in numerous ways, including facilitating communication between the staff and the mom-to-be, providing practical and emotional support, and assisting with non-pharmacological pain relief methods, among other things.  Having a trustworthy person around can indeed help reduce discomfort, as research shows that there’s a positive correlation between a spouse’s participation in childbirth and pain relief. Moreover, the study pointed out that their presence is beneficial not only for the mother herself, but also for their partner, which is why the majority of spouses say they would participate in subsequent births as well.  Nowadays, quite a few dads are present during the birth of their child but that wasn’t always the case  Image credits: Craig Adderley (not the actual photo)  Positive effects of having a partner present during childbirth might be one of the reasons quite a few expectant mothers want them by their side during such a significant moment. Some research suggests that as much as 85% of women say they would like their husband to be there.  NPR pointed out that even though nowadays seeing fathers in the delivery room is quite common, it wasn’t as usual back in the day. Medical historian Judy Leavitt told NPR that traditionally giving birth was mostly a female event. Even when the births moved from home to the hospital in the 20th century, husbands would typically remain in the waiting rooms. According to the historian, fathers started staying around for the birth of their babies roughly in the ‘70s and ‘80s.  A 2016 study of the birth experience from the perspective of the fathers revealed that their attendance in childbirth had a positive effect on all of the main parties involved—the mother, the newborn, and the dads themselves. According to the study, as much as 94% of them were happy to be present for such an event. However, they admitted to feeling some extent of helplessness and fear as well, in addition being somewhat overwhelmed by the event.  Considering the benefits of having your partner by your side while giving birth, it’s understandable why Bramty wanted her husband around. She also wanted her mother to be there, who is arguably a person she trusts; and according to the World Health Organization, compassion and trustworthiness are two of the main characteristics that pregnant women seek in their companions during childbirth. The content creator might have not felt the same level of connection with her husband’s family. In addition to that, she didn’t appreciate some of their actions, which seemingly shocked quite a few people in the comments as well.  The online community had plenty to say about the situation  Some people shared stories about similar personal experiences","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvcmVkcGFuZGEuY29tL21pbC1ydWlucy1iaXJ0aC1leHBlcmllbmNlLWJyYW10eS8_X3Q9MSZfZj1mZWF0dXJlZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"birth","2023-05-17","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 01:24:39","News that a mother in Cyprus gave birth to her ninth child was reported on Wednesday against a backdrop of mounting concerns over the island’s falling fertility rates. According to the latest data, Cyprus has a fertility rate of just 1.3 children per woman – the 14th lowest in the world.  Data from the interior ministry showed 500 fewer babies were born in 2022 than the preceding year–a total of 7,316 children compared with 7,867 in 2021, SigmaLive reported.  Some have speculated that the pandemic quarantine nudged many couples to take the leap into parenthood or have another child.  A breakdown of the 2022 numbers shows most mothers had their first or second child (3,510 and 2,751 respectively). The numbers drop steeply for those having their third child (790) and even further for those having their fourth (177). Mothers having their fifth child was down to double digits (25) while eight had their sixth, three their seventh, two their eighth and one mother had her ninth child.  The data obtained concerned only Greek Cypriot mothers.  The health ministry on Wednesday meanwhile promoted legislation to increase subsidies for infertility treatments and make them easier to obtain.  Health Minister Popi Kanari, speaking on Tuesday night at an event on the topic, said the subsidies will include storage of eggs by women aiming to preserve their fertility over time.  Success rates for infertility procedures, however, decline steeply depending on the cause of the infertility, as well as with age, and treatments are not without risk.  In 2019, the UKs NIH reported the percentage of IVF treatments resulting in live births to be just shy of one third (32 per cent) for women in the youngest category, that is, under 35. Success rates plummeted to 25 per cent for women aged up to 37, with a continuing drop reaching to merely 4 to 5 per cent for women aged 43 and over.  Early family planning thus looms large as a critical piece of the puzzle and needs to be addressed in any policy-driven efforts to raise the country’s birth rate.  The health minister noted that the average Cypriot woman currently gives birth to her first child at the age of 32. Women should be encouraged to begin planning a family as early as possible, the minister said, since even natural fertility decreases noticeably after the age of 35.  Among other proposed actions are awareness-raising and management of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), which if not treated promptly, increase infertility, especially for women.  Moreover, it is important to know that having children later in life may add physical, psychological and financial stressors, particularly for those embarking on the journey to parenthood via assisted reproduction, the minister said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vY3lwcnVzLW1haWwuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTgvY3lwcmlvdC13b21hbi1naXZlcy1iaXJ0aC10by1oZXItbmludGgtY2hpbGQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"birth","2023-07-01","Not Discerned","{""Miami"", ""Florida"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 15:51:04","It will soon be against the law for transgender people to use the restroom not aligned with their gender identity.  Gov. Ron DeSantis signed legislation (HB 1521) that will require restrooms to be segregated by gender in public buildings. The new law also will make it a crime to use the restroom not matching a person’s sex at birth.  The Republican Governor said the bill would ensure “women’s safety” in the state of Florida. He noted the bill will apply in corrections institutes, including juvenile ones, and at public schools.  “A woman should not be in a locker room having to worry about someone from the opposite sex being in their locker room, and it’s happening with athletics, with our girl athletes and women athletes,” DeSantis said.  “Also with some of these other things, whether it’s a prison situation, whether it’s just these restrooms, you know, we want to make sure that our roles and our women are protected. And so this bill does that and makes sure that they’re not going to be exposed to situations that are not in their best interest.”  The law will go into effect on July 1.  Immediately, the bill and several others signed the same day but DeSantis drew a rebuke from LGBTQ activists.  “The simple act of being able to go to the bathroom has been taken away from our kids,” said Jennifer Solomon, president of PFLAG South Miami. “As parents in this state, we are not being respected and our children aren’t being respected.”  The measure was among several signed Wednesday that will disproportionately impact transgender Floridians.  During the Legislative Session, lawmakers passed Senate language limiting restrictions to public facilities, and not imposing regulations on private retailers. Lawmakers behind the bill characterized the new law as “common sense.”  “There’s not anything in the language of this bill that is targeting any specific group,” said Sen. Erin Grall, a Vero Beach Republican, on the Senate floor. “Rather it speaks to the differences that we have as different sexes as male and female.”  Rep. Rachel Plakon suggested this simply puts a framework in state law that has been in effect practically for more than a century.  “We’ve had a huge scientific study with billions of people for 136 years that separate facilities work,” she said.  But LGBTQ activists and sympathetic lawmakers said the bathroom restrictions represent gross overreach.  Rep. Kelly Skidmore, a Boca Raton Democrat, suggested the bill will ultimately prove unenforceable, especially as it doesn’t even exclude transgender people who have fully transitioned.  “My sister’s boyfriend is a trans man. He is a full blown man and you want him to walk into the girls room,” she said. “Do you understand? And then you want someone to go in there and tell him that he’s in the wrong bathroom. But it’s the bathroom you’re sending him to. You have no idea what you are doing here.”  Enforcement will be dependent on whatever agencies oversee the public facility in question in the event individuals use a bathroom they are not entitled to enter.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vZmxvcmlkYXBvbGl0aWNzLmNvbS9hcmNoaXZlcy82MTI3NjctZ292LWRlc2FudGlzLXNpZ25zLW5ldy1sYXctZ292ZXJuaW5nLWJhdGhyb29tLXVzZS1ieS1iaXJ0aC1nZW5kZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"birth","2017-08-03","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 19:00:03","No one is who they say that are in Giving Birth to a Butterfly, especially not the women. Beautifully shot on 16mm, Theodore Schaefer‘s directorial debut (available to stream today) follows Diana (Annie Parisse), a frustrated wife and mother, who finds her identity has been stolen by internet fraudsters unknown, in the midst of a crisis of confidence for her entire family. Her husband, Daryl (Paul Sparks) wants to be a chef but finds himself stuck in a dead-end job at a burger place, wearing someone else’s apron as he makes a change.  His children call him chef as they pass take-out back and forth. Their son, Drew (Owen Campbell), is really named Andrew, but Daryl insists the family only use names that start with D. Drew has agreed to be the father to his pregnant girlfriend’s child by someone else, taking on the role eagerly, lacking an identity of his own. His girlfriend, Marlene (Gus Birney), lives in her delusional mother’s shadow, her pregnancy unacknowledged, her presence largely ignored. In the face of Diana’s sudden destitution, she and Marlene embark on a secret road trip to track down the thieves and get Diana’s money back, to strange and unexpected results. Each individual character is well drawn, and the film’s first act in particular presents an intriguing set up for a mystery of both cosmic and quotidian proportions. Yet, while there is potential for poignancy in this (overtly) Homeric and surreal journey for self-acceptance, as it progresses, like its titular butterflies, the film ultimately gets lost in the breeze.  Ghosts  Giving Birth to a Butterfly is a story about the ties that bind us, to each other as well as to reality itself. The responsibilities of children, family, and adulthood drag at these characters as they drift through life delivering poetic monologues back and forth, unheard and overlooked. Diana and Daryl (real-life spouses) seem to have nothing in common anymore, never communicating directly as they save up for Daryl’s restaurant and process their son’s unorthodox relationship. They communicate around each other through strained silences and the occasional insult. For Diana, their marriage has come to represent compromise in a life already full of them.  At work, a young boy asks her to sell him a single condom from a pack (“do they come in different sizes?” he asks hopefully. “Why don’t you start with these…” she replies, handing him a generic box). He doesn’t have the money, and she offers to cover them herself, in one of the seemingly endless concessions she’s made to men at this juncture of her life. When her credit card gets declined, we learn that her one attempt to do something that isn’t for Daryl has backfired and she’s lost their shared savings. Her reason: She wanted to make some money for her daughter, Danielle (Rachel Resheff), a phantom of a character who’s working as a technician at the community theater during a production fittingly called “Ghost,” shining a light on others and, like Diana, leaving little space for herself.  Even on stage, actors revoke their own identities (through stage names, through their roles, etc.) and lose their sense of self. Marlene’s mother (and Birney‘s real-life mother, Constance Shulman), channels Norma Desmond and Blanche DuBois as she stalks through her home in thrift gowns, giving “tell-all” interviews to invisible reporters: “It’s about time I tell my story!” She is never addressed by her first name, Monica, usually reduced to her more mundane role as Marlene’s mother even as she tries to adopt a stage name no one will ever hear for her nonexistent stage roles. Marlene suggests they name the baby after her at one point: “What about Monica? My mother’s not using it.” “Sometimes I think about getting a name change,” Diana grimly tells Marlene at one point on their trip. Motherhood, like marriage, isn’t easy.  Conclusion  Each performer gamely attempts to flesh out these spectral characters, but weighty dialogue bogs them down. Tragically, the intentionally on-the-nose dialogue of “Ghost,” the play Danielle is lighting, shares an uncomfortable similarity to the dialogue the leads deliver in reams. Cryptic, Lynchian monologues can be intriguing, but quickly lose their appeal when it becomes apparent that there is little else propelling the narrative. The mysteries at the film’s heart have more potential than payoff.  Nevertheless, the film is undeniably creative and dreamlike, with moments of winning, artful surrealism, largely created through the use of dissolves and striking imagery (aquariums are a constant presence, seeming to witness the film like a Greek chorus presided over by a tropical fish named Homer – though Drew insists it’s Homer for Simpson). The Alice in Wonderland air Schaefer aims to lend the material is engaging, coming through in flashes that could have been aided by a greater variety of scenarios and concepts. At one point, Monica tells Diana never to say, “good luck,” only “break a leg.” Here’s wishing Schaefer the same for his next film.  Giving Birth to a Butterfly is playing in select theaters and is available to stream as of May 16th.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpbG1pbnF1aXJ5LmNvbS9naXZpbmctYmlydGgtdG8tYS0yMDIxLXJldmlldy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The interview goes on to reveal Tesfaye’s connection to film, “As a child, I loved to hear myself sing. But I was really shy and wouldn’t do it in public. I didn’t know if I was good or not. In high school, my love for films was born. I grew up on The Mask and Jurassic Park. Jim Carrey and dinosaurs!

Learn More  Asteroid City: Scarlett Johansson Started Filming Just 8 Weeks After Giving Birth  Any talented actor can tell you that creating onscreen magic is sometimes akin to giving birth. And for some actors, those experiences can arrive close together.  In Scarlett Johansson's case, her son and filming for her latest role — that of fictional Hollywood star Midge Campbell in the Wes Anderson sci-fi comedy ""Asteroid City"" — arrived within weeks of one another. The actress told Entertainment Weekly in May 2023 that she started filming eight weeks after giving birth to Cosmo Joost. Having agreed to appear in the film during the COVID-19 quarantine and done a lot of work sculpting Midge into a full-blooded being with Anderson, she wasn't ready to cede the role when she discovered that she was pregnant as the film headed into production. Johansson resultantly helped Anderson shoot around any delays her pregnancy might impose on the production.  Anderson started by taking Johansson's close-ups first, then later filming two-shots, group shots, and wide shots featuring her character. It turns out that she also had a little on-set help from one of her co-stars, who was more than happy to offer her a friendly shoulder while she got her post-delivery bearings and tried to keep her focus while filming.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmxvb3Blci5jb20vMTI4OTM3MC9hc3Rlcm9pZC1jaXR5LXNjYXJsZXR0LWpvaGFuc3Nvbi1zdGFydGVkLWZpbG1pbmctOC13ZWVrcy1hZnRlci1naXZpbmctYmlydGgv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Her beloved daughter survived one challenge after another. Now they're enjoying every moment with this miracle baby. Madelyn Mire was born weighing only one pound, four ounces. The frightening journey began when her mother, Jennilee, was 20 weeks pregnant.  ""Everything was going really well until then! I almost skipped that appointment, so there are a whole lot of miracles surrounding that, but I found out my cervix was 100% effaced,"" explains Jennilee. That's considered a medical emergency and could have forced Jennilee into labor at any moment, so doctors performed a procedure to try to delay it.  At that point, Jennilee was told she had to get to 24-week pregnancy, or her baby wouldn't survive. They had already been through so much. ""Our previous daughter was born at 26 weeks, she actually passed away. And so, we this was our rainbow baby and here we are, going through this again,"" explains Jennilee.  LUNCH FOR THE SOUL: Father of 7 discusses recovery from traumatic brain injury  They transferred to a hospital in the Texas Medical Center with a Level 4 Neo-natal Intensive Care Unit, equipped and staffed to help dangerously ill or premature newborns. Tiny Madelyn was born at 23 weeks and two days and the courageous feats to save her life began. She and her mom had the same infection.  ""She had contracted E. coli, which was her most immediate danger at the time. It crossed the blood-brain barrier, because when they're that small, they don't really have one, and it became meningitis. She also had a brain bleed and cysts on her brain. She had respiratory distress syndrome, which most of the preemies do, but she was on a ventilator for that. She had a heart PDA, which is an issue that they have when born preterm. And then of course they're always worried about their eyes and are hearing when they're that small,"" states Jennilee.  Jennilee went into action beyond medicine to save her newborn. ""I went in ready for battle, spiritual battle and I just started praying and casting death off of her, pleading the blood of Jesus over her. I had actually been introduced to a ministry called The Supernatural Life and had some spiritual deliverance in my life, and it really opened my eyes to the fact that we're in a spiritual battle. In Mark 16: 17-18, it says that the signs shall follow those who believe and at the end of that, it says they shall lay hands on the stick, and they will be healed and I knew that I had seen healings right in front of my eyes,"" says Jennilee.

The doctor stopped me and said, 'we don't know what happened, but it's not there and there's no sign of the necrotizing whatever it's called, the brain is not dying, and we don't see the meningitis.' I almost collapsed, and the doctor caught me and told me to keep praying,"" she added.  From that day on, Jennilee says little Madelyn began to thrive. ""The brain bleeds stopped, and it started drying up, the cysts started shriveling up, and her heart PDA closed in time,"" says Jennilee.

""We have come so far! At first, it's just it's a lot of feelings of helplessness and not knowing what to expect. We went through this before, and when it was happening again, it was hard not to think the worst up front with Jennilee going into labor again,"" said Madelyn’s dad and Jennilee’s husband, Jacob. ""All I could do was just get into reaction mode. Just basically be there for support and continue to pray. It really does bring out the most in faith, just sitting there praying, hoping for the best, and relying on God.""  Madelyn is now a healthy and happy 1-year-old, but it was challenging when they brought her home at 37 weeks gestational age. ""We needed to make sure her environment is just as well as the NICU and just watching every little heartbeat we put have the heartbeat monitor on her and just kind of sit there and watch it on our phones and we just, we stayed up I would say more than a normal parent just because she was so precious to us from all she has been through. She's got every, all the attributes of a normal kid. She's perfect in every way and God is good. He has blessed us. He's showing us miracles through her, and we continue to see them each and every day,"" says Jacob.

Her discharge papers actually say miracle, they actually say that her stay was miraculous. Every doctor that we talked to said that's a miracle. It's a miracle that happened to her that she recovered that she's a 23 weaker and there's nothing wrong with her. She's perfect. She doesn't have any delays. No health effects, no cerebral palsy. Just nothing and her eyes are perfect. She's unreal,"" says a smiling Jennilee.  The Mire's believe a natural approach helped in Madelyn's healing as well, they didn't allow vaccinations when she was only two pounds, and her dad was her blood donor. They also want families to realize we have two centers in Houston known for saving micro-preemies, like Madelyn. If they hadn't found out to transfer hospitals, it's unlikely Madelyn would've survived.

(KXNET) — A woman who says she was forced to vacate her government-financed Mandan townhome following the birth of her fifth child has now settled the suit.  Shukri Ahmed and High Plains Fair Housing Center filed the suit against Affordable Housing Developers, Inc. in June 2021, after Ahmed says she was forced to vacate Trails West Townhomes following the birth of her fifth child. Ahmed and High Plains Fair Housing Center argued that the decision not to renew Ahmed’s lease was discriminatory. They said the decision violated state and federal law, and that Ahmed was being discriminated against because of her familial status. Affordable Housing Developers responded that Ahmed’s family exceeded their occupancy limits with one adult and five children living in the unit.  Mandan woman claims she was kicked out of townhome for having too many children  As part of the settlement agreement, Affordable Housing Developers will pay $100,000 to Ahmed and High Plains Fair Housing Center, while maintaining the organization did not engage in discriminatory housing practices. The agreement also states that Affordable Housing Developers will implement a revised occupancy policy at its rental properties, and further stipulates that information about fair housing be distributed to tenants, with a fair housing poster to be displayed at each apartment complex it owns or operates.  A news release issued by High Plains Fair Housing Center states that Ahmed “had never been late on rent or incurred a lease violation in the previous 4 years of her tenancy at the property. She was a nurse in the community and paid the full market rental rate. All of the children in the household were under the age of 10 and were not in violation of city code occupancy standards for the 3-bedroom, 1,572 square foot townhome.”  The news release also stated that when the only other available housing Ahmed could find required her to make more money, she accepted a job as a traveling nurse in Fargo to earn the necessary income. However, the new landlord required her to provide two to three months worth of paystubs before moving in — and she only had 30 days to vacate her unit at Trails West Townhomes. Facing homelessness, the release notes that Ahmed “had no choice but to uproot her family and move out of the area, causing immeasurable damages to her and her young children.”  The executive director for High Plains Fair Housing Center, Michelle Rydz, noted in the news release that “strict and numerical occupancy standards applied to families with children under the age of 18 exclude large families from available housing. Evicting, non-renewing, or excluding families due to the birth of a child means those families lose access to their communities, jobs, good schools, and places of worship, and is against the law.”  KX News reached out to the executive director of Affordable Housing Developers for comment. We have not yet heard back.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmt4bmV0LmNvbS9uZXdzL3dvbWFuLXNldHRsZXMtc3VpdC1zYXlzLXNoZS13YXMtZm9yY2VkLWZyb20tbWFuZGFuLXRvd25ob21lLWFmdGVyLWJpcnRoLW9mLWZpZnRoLWNoaWxkL9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmt4bmV0LmNvbS9uZXdzL3dvbWFuLXNldHRsZXMtc3VpdC1zYXlzLXNoZS13YXMtZm9yY2VkLWZyb20tbWFuZGFuLXRvd25ob21lLWFmdGVyLWJpcnRoLW9mLWZpZnRoLWNoaWxkL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"birth","2021-07-25","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 10:30:00","For the last decade, deaths have outnumbered births in rural Pennsylvania, a series of reports released on Monday found.  In addition to these findings, the reports recorded a net-gain in population to rural parts of the commonwealth through in-migration.  The reports, released by the Center for Rural Pennsylvania, a state legislative agency for rural policy, use data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Health, to better understand the commonwealth’s rural areas, including who is moving into — and out — of them.  In-Migration/Out-Migration  Data from the U.S. Census Bureau shows that in 2021, more than 144,900 people moved into rural Pennsylvania and approximately 123,300 moved out. This movement resulted in a net gain of approximately 21,600 new residents, down from 21,800 in 2019.  The report found that the majority of people (52%) moving to rural Pennsylvania, were from out-of-state.  In fact, more than 54% of the people moving to rural Pennsylvania came from neighboring states New York, New Jersey, and Maryland.  Another 41% of the people who moved to rural areas of the commonwealth came from its urban areas, compared to 2019 when 38% came from urban Pennsylvania.  Lastly, 7% of the people who moved to rural Pennsylvania came from outside of the United States.  Of those who left rural Pennsylvania, 53% went to other states, compared to 61% in 2019.  Fifty-one percent of those moved to one of the following five states: Florida, New York, Maryland, North Carolina, and South Carolina.  Additionally, 47% of those who moved out of rural Pennsylvania relocated to urban areas in 2021.  The report identified working adults and college students as the two largest demographic groups driving in-migration to rural areas of the commonwealth.  Working adults between the ages of 18 and 64 made up 40% of the people who moved out of rural Pennsylvania and 37% of those who moved into rural areas.  College students made up 22% of those who moved into rural Pennsylvania and 18% of those who moved out, according to the report.  Birth & Death Rates  From 2010 to 2020, deaths outnumbered births in rural Pennsylvania, accounting for the loss of nearly 85,000 residents.  Nationally, the birth rate from 2010 to 2020 was 12.13 per 1,000 residents, according to census data.  At 10.87 births per 1,000 residents, Pennsylvania had one of the nation’s lowest birth rates over the same time period with only eight states having lower birth rates.  In rural Pennsylvania, the birth rate was lower than the statewide rate at 9.17 births per 1,000 residents.  The report found that Wayne, Centre, Sullivan, Pike, and Forest counties had the lowest birth rates with each having rates below 8 births per 1,000 residents.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZWhpZ2h2YWxsZXlsaXZlLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjMvMDUvZGVzcGl0ZS1sb3ctYmlydGgtcmF0ZS1ydXJhbC1wYS1zZWVzLXBvcHVsYXRpb24tZ2Fpbi1mcm9tLW1vcmUtZm9sa3MtbW92aW5nLWluLXJlcG9ydHMtc2F5Lmh0bWzSAZwBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGVoaWdodmFsbGV5bGl2ZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLzA1L2Rlc3BpdGUtbG93LWJpcnRoLXJhdGUtcnVyYWwtcGEtc2Vlcy1wb3B1bGF0aW9uLWdhaW4tZnJvbS1tb3JlLWZvbGtzLW1vdmluZy1pbi1yZXBvcnRzLXNheS5odG1sP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

After putting her two children to bed in a Southern California extended-stay hotel, the two-time WNBA All-Star went right back into work mode.  “I’m very fortunate that they want to do this partnership,” Hamby told Yahoo Sports, referencing her endeavor with breast-pump company Willow to help educate working moms about their legal rights and protections in the workplace.  The 29-year-old has a lot on her plate. She’s adjusting to a new team, the Los Angeles Sparks, while caring for her 9-week-old son and 6-year-old daughter. At the same time, Hamby is reckoning with the hurt of being traded from the Las Vegas Aces during her pregnancy. After the January trade, she released a statement detailing “disgusting comments” and “discrimination” from the team with which she had spent her entire eight-year career.  After two investigations by the WNBA, the league on Tuesday rescinded the Aces’ 2025 draft pick and suspended head coach Becky Hammon for two games without pay. Part of the disciplinary action was in response to Hammon’s comments about Hamby’s pregnancy, the league found. Hammon denied those claims Wednesday, saying that she asked about Hamby’s pregnancy once, and her trade was because the team would get additional players.  Now in L.A., Hamby is already back in action. She spent Mother’s Day playing in a scrimmage against the Seattle Storm.  Her choice to get back on the court so soon started from a place of revenge and developed into something more profound. The two-time All-Star is playing to prove something to herself, accepting a role at the forefront of the fight for mothers’ workplace rights in the process.  Dearica Hamby and her daughter, Amaya, at Sparks' media day. (Christina House / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)  The WNBA season starts Friday. The Sparks will have Hamby for their regular-season opener against the Phoenix Mercury, but they didn’t expect to.  “I literally called them a week before camp and was like, ‘Hey, I’m coming to L.A.,’ and they were like, ‘Really?’ and here I am getting ready to play,” Hamby said.  New Sparks head coach Curt Miller and general manager Karen Bryant spent months assuring Hamby that she was safe to take her time and urging her to do so. “No, I’m coming back to play,” she told them before she even knew when that would be.  As she sat in her Las Vegas home and watched athletes get ready for training camp on social media, she couldn’t deny the call of the court. Through injuries and her first pregnancy, the 6-foot-3 forward has never missed a season.  “I had sadness after the trade, and then I had to kind of dial into myself for a little bit,” Hamby said. “Because initially it was about proving the Aces wrong, and I had to be like, ‘Nah, that’s not OK. I need to do it for myself.’ That shouldn’t matter.”  Hamby resumed playing three months after giving birth to her daughter, Amaya. Now, she credits the “determination and willpower” to prove to herself that she can do it again as a motivator.  She informed her new team that she would skip any allotted postpartum rest time and head to training camp “four of five” days before it started — which is why she’s in a hotel temporarily.  “I’m comfortable here,” Hamby said of her “penthouse” digs. “They’re helping me find a new place.” In addition to assisting in the home search, the Sparks are “always asking if there’s any way they can help,” Hamby said. “If I ask something, it gets done right away. It’s just really encouraging and kind of a different feel from what I left toward the end of my situation.”  The experience lingers with Hamby so much that her hands started shaking when she spoke about facing her former team. The Sparks play the Aces on May 25 and 27. Hammon will be suspended during the first game. The second one will be in Las Vegas, following the Aces’ ring ceremony. Hamby played in the 2022 Finals for her former team while pregnant, but her presence for the championship banner unveiling won’t go as she imagined it would.  “I’m just going to try to be myself and play hard. I’m not going to try to do too much,” she said of how she’ll approach those likely emotional games. She’ll still be less than three months postpartum. “It’s not about proving them wrong; you’re where you’re supposed to be,” she said she reminds herself when she becomes too self-critical.  Even though she’s focused on Sparks basketball, her health and her children’s health now, Hamby noted a specific exchange that still holds weight for her.  “A person from the Aces staff made a comment to me when I said that I was pregnant: ‘Nobody asks you about your championships. They ask you about your kids.’ And despite everything, I kind of held that comment close to me, and I continue to live by that,” Hamby said.  In what seems like a perfect response, Hamby brought both of her kids to her first media day with the Sparks earlier this month. In addition to excitement and gratitude, she couldn’t help but feel how different everything was.  “Obviously, I’ve been in such a different situation for so long, so [it’s] just getting back comfortable,” Hamby said. “But it meant a lot to me. Obviously, Legend [her son] doesn’t understand, but Amaya is fully aware, and she understands. She asked questions like, ‘Did you do this with me when I was born?’” Hamby recalled.  In addition to asking questions and helping her mom with her younger brother, Amaya did an interview that the WNBA posted on social media. It offered a reminder of how often the league and Hamby’s former team highlighted her motherhood before the trade.

I think that’s what kind of makes me and my situation so special. It’s because my family comes first.”  With the Sparks, Hamby also will work to remain true to herself as a player. She is known to be a leader, bringing hustle and toughness to the floor. She’s still in the early period of seeing how her play style jells with the Sparks’ roster, but those key traits transition into her life.  When Hamby made her statement after the trade, WNBPA president Nneka Ogwumike issued her new teammate a warning. “You know, this is going to put you in the forefront for working moms in our league, as this continues and it opens up more. Are you going to be OK with that?’” Hamby recalled Ogwumike asking.  Hamby’s response: “I think everything happens for a reason.”  Hamby wants to prevent her struggle from happening to anyone else. The Chicago Sky’s Ruthy Hebard recently became a mom, calling the WNBA moms club “elite company.” Phoenix Mercury’s Skylar-Diggins Smiith also recently welcomed her second child.  “It seems to become more common now. I mean, I think this past year, there are maybe five or six different women that are choosing to carry and have kids,” Hamby said. “It was kind of frowned upon early on in this league. You're just afraid of what would be next after basketball if this didn’t work out or you wouldn’t be able to play.”  That fear is part of her motivation to promote education and resources for parents and companies, even though she shied away from being too vocal early in her career.  ”This is growth,” Hamby said. “When I had my first child and I was nursing, I was pumping in the open. It didn't bother me, but for some moms, it may be a little bit disturbing. We didn't have the resources six years ago.” She acknowledged that progress was made with the most recent CBA to allow WNBA moms their full salaries, but a pregnant player being traded was unprecedented.  “I’m kind of a staple player in this league, who has been praised for being a mom. Then I give birth again, and now it’s kind of like the opposite,” Hamby said. “So if it can happen to me, it can happen to anybody. Now being able to, I think I will be more involved in that [advocacy].”  In addition to being an advocate, Hamby told reporters at a Sparks practice Tuesday that “this part of it is over; me and the union will continue to explore more options.”  In the closed scrimmage Sunday, Miller reportedly gave Hamby substantial minutes to see how she plays through fatigue. Regardless of what approach he takes with her time on Friday, plenty of eyes will be on her.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0cy55YWhvby5jb20vd2h5LXNwYXJrcy1kZWFyaWNhLWhhbWJ5LXB1c2hlZC1mb3ItYS1yZXR1cm4tdG8tdGhlLWNvdXJ0LWxlc3MtdGhhbi0zLW1vbnRocy1hZnRlci1naXZpbmctYmlydGgtMTkzNzEzOTA3Lmh0bWzSAY8BaHR0cHM6Ly9zcG9ydHMueWFob28uY29tL2FtcGh0bWwvd2h5LXNwYXJrcy1kZWFyaWNhLWhhbWJ5LXB1c2hlZC1mb3ItYS1yZXR1cm4tdG8tdGhlLWNvdXJ0LWxlc3MtdGhhbi0zLW1vbnRocy1hZnRlci1naXZpbmctYmlydGgtMTkzNzEzOTA3Lmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"birth","2023-03-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 17:48:33","Medical progress and technological advancement are amazing things. With the assistance of donor reproductive material, as well as the help of a surrogate or gestational carrier, we have overcome prior limitations to reproduction. But with great power also comes great responsibility. So we often ask whether we are pushing the limits too far, as a matter of medical ethics. There is a danger, though, of applying reflexive norms to new situations. In other words, what can seem “weird” or strange to people today, can become the new normal tomorrow.  In March 2023, reporters across the world announced the birth of a child to the 68-year-old Spanish actress Ana Obregón, by a gestational surrogate in the United States. The news was met with considerable criticism, given 1) her use of a surrogate, which was perfectly legal in the United States but illegal in Spain, and 2) Obregón’s age. However, the real twist was yet to come. A few weeks after initial reports of the new baby’s arrival, more details were revealed. The child was not, in fact, Obregón’s daughter, but actually her granddaughter, conceived with sperm from Obregón’s late son, Aless Lequoio, and presumably donor eggs. Lequoio died in 2020 at the age of 27 from cancer. Obregón explained in an interview to Hola! magazine that having children was her son’s dying wish.  Obregón’s granddaughter’s conception story is unique, but are the concerns of detractors justified? Let’s take the objections one by one.  Surrogacy in general. First, Obregón is from a country where surrogacy is illegal. Spain, like most Western European countries, does not permit surrogacy arrangements, even when no compensation changes hands. Not all European countries have the same policy — England, for instance, permits altruistic gestational surrogacy, where the gestational carrier receives no compensation. And Eastern European countries, like Ukraine and Russia, permit both gestational surrogacy and compensation of the surrogate, but only for intended parents who are heterosexual married couples.  The United States, of course, has numerous state-by-state legal regimes when it comes to surrogacy. Most U.S. states have surrogacy-supportive laws that are open to all families, including same-sex couples and single parents. While much ink is spilled pondering the differences in culture and law, much of it boils down to fundamental societal beliefs.  In Europe and much of the world, policymakers have articulated a fear of the exploitation of women in the context of surrogacy. The risk, they see, is in economically coercing women in poor economic situations to risk their health and lives for those with more means. The U.S., by contrast, has a more capitalist culture that relies primarily on individual responsibility. The result is more supportive laws that give a woman the freedom to make the risk assessment for herself, and to freely, without interference from the government, act as a surrogate.  The varying attitudes become more entrenched, as public policy mirrors cultural norms.  Age. Next up, Obregón’s age: 68. Some states have a minimum age for a surrogate or intended parent to enter into a surrogacy arrangement, such as the age of 21 in Colorado; but no state has a maximum age prescribed by law. There are guidelines, however, such as those set by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM).  By way of an Ethics Committee Opinion, ASRM recommends that “because of concerns related to the high-risk nature of pregnancy, as well as longevity, treatment of women over the age of 55 should generally be discouraged.” The opinion explains that the reasoning is not just about a health risk to a woman carrying a pregnancy at an older age, but concerns of the death of a parent while the child is still young.  “Parental loss is one of the most stressful life events for children or adolescents. Although a 50-year-old Caucasian woman in the U.S. has a life-expectancy of over 80 years, on average, it is more likely that a woman who starts her family at 50 rather than at 30 will die before her child reaches adulthood.” On the other hand, the Ethics Committee Opinion points out that “very few studies have been published about parenting in women who conceived and delivered after natural menopause. The limited data, however, do not support concerns that older parents have reduced parenting capacity.” In fact, “the greater financial and emotional stability some older parents offer may be an advantage to children.” Score one for older parents.  And, of course, this is without getting into the misogynistic judgment of older women as parents while men have children at an older age all the time. To applause. BTW, congrats to Robert De Niro, 79, on the recent birth of his seventh child.  Posthumous conception. Among the criticisms in this situation, one of the most common is focused on Obregón’s use of her deceased son’s sperm to conceive her granddaughter. Most states in the United States do not have specific legal prohibition preventing the use of a person’s sperm or eggs after their death. However, as a practice, it’s often difficult for survivors to show sufficient consent from the deceased to make a medical provider comfortable moving forward. At least one court — a New York case involving a West Point cadet named Peter Zhu — granted the parents the right to have their son’s sperm retrieved while he was on life support. The court relied on evidence of the son’s statements during his lifetime that he wished to have children.  I have written on posthumous conception before and on my confession of evolving beliefs. Despite writing a lengthy law review article in 2015 stressing the importance of explicit consent of the deceased before using their gametes, I have more recently come to believe that in many cases, perhaps too much emphasis is placed on such explicit consent. The survivors that conceive children using the reproductive material of a deceased loved one tend to be of healthy economic means and to have children that come into the world very much wanted, loved, and supported. We could only wish for that same level of love and support for every child.  I get it. Obregón’s family structure is unusual. But I, for one, support her. Congratulations to Ana and baby Ana. Wishing you both a bright future.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vYWJvdmV0aGVsYXcuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvaXMtYS02OC15ZWFyLW9sZC1hcnJhbmdpbmctdGhlLWJpcnRoLW9mLWhlci1kZWNlYXNlZC1zb25zLWNoaWxkLWJ5LXN1cnJvZ2FjeS1sZWdhbC_SAXlodHRwczovL2Fib3ZldGhlbGF3LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1L2lzLWEtNjgteWVhci1vbGQtYXJyYW5naW5nLXRoZS1iaXJ0aC1vZi1oZXItZGVjZWFzZWQtc29ucy1jaGlsZC1ieS1zdXJyb2dhY3ktbGVnYWwvP2FtcD0x?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

In front of a judge on Wednesday, with her parents by her side, Melissa Highsmith officially changed her name back to the one given to her at birth.  ""It's like God has given me a second chance at life. It's like I'm starting over,” she said.  Melissa was abducted as an infant by her babysitter 51 years ago. Despite her family immediately contacting the police and beginning an exhaustive search, she was never found.  “I just believed that wherever she was, that’s where God wanted her,” her mother Alta Apantenco said.  Melissa, now 53, ended up living a difficult life under a new name, Melanie Walden. She never knew her true family was searching for her all these years.  “We have been rejoicing, we all know it’s happening. God is putting his faithfulness and love and power on full display,"" said family pastor Shane Gray at the courthouse on Wednesday. ""In the darkest nights of Melissa‘s life, she was not alone. In the most hopeless moments of the Highsmith’s search for their daughter, there was hope.”  Posters and flyers were circulated for years. An age-progressed photo by the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children was even released later on but leads, some in other parts of the country, were dead ends.  A previous flyer with a depiction of what authorities thought Melissa looked like  ""We had several times rechecked some leads, but they were nothing,” Alta said.  Over the years as her parents grew older, Melissa’s siblings took over the search. They helped Melissa’s father, Jeffrie Highsmith, take a DNA test with 23andMe to see where it took them in their search.  It was a success. A match was found with one of Melissa’s three children. Soon, the Highsmith family learned Melissa had been living in the Fort Worth area the entire time.  ""And to know that she was here all these years, it's disappointing,” said Alta. “But I’m happy that we’re together again. I’m just really excited about what’s going to come.”  She reunited with her parents and several siblings just before the holidays. The Highsmith family shared their reunion story with NBC 5 in November 2022.  ""It was hope that brought Melissa home. It really was prayer and hope,” said Melissa’s brother, Jeffrie. “It’s a dream come true.”  The family has been making up for lost time ever since. Melissa has been meeting four siblings and droves of nephews, nieces, uncles, aunts and cousins.  Her cousin Jannae Hayes, who held onto a picture of themselves as infants playing in a crib, ended up naming her own daughter after Melissa.  ""She's our missing puzzle piece, she was the piece that was always missing and now our family is complete.” Melissa’s sister, Victoria  “I don’t think we ever thought we would find her. So to find her and get her back and for her to be able to get her name back that they stole from her. It’s a special day today.”  Just two weeks ago, Fort Worth police officially confirmed Melissa's identity through their own DNA testing, which allowed her to change her name in court.  ""I feel fantastic getting her name back to where it should've been after all these years,” said Melissa’s father, Jeffrie.  Melissa said she now plans to get a passport in her official name so she can go visit another sibling who happens to live in Spain.  She also plans to hold another wedding ceremony with her husband using her new name ... So that her real father can walk her down the aisle.  ""I just know God was with me watching over me. It gives me goosebumps. He heard their prayers and everything,” Melissa said of the experience. ""It's just indescribable. I'm on top of the world.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY2Rmdy5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9mb3J0LXdvcnRoLXdvbWFuLWFiZHVjdGVkLWFzLWJhYnktb2ZmaWNpYWxseS1jaGFuZ2VzLW5hbWUtYmFjay10by1iaXJ0aC1uYW1lLzMyNjAxNDgv0gF9aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmJjZGZ3LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2ZvcnQtd29ydGgtd29tYW4tYWJkdWN0ZWQtYXMtYmFieS1vZmZpY2lhbGx5LWNoYW5nZXMtbmFtZS1iYWNrLXRvLWJpcnRoLW5hbWUvMzI2MDE0OC8_YW1wPTE?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Tasmanian devil named Adventurous Lisa was released into a 1,000-acre wildlife sanctuary in Australia's Barrington Tops by Chris Hemsworth and his wife, Elsa Pataky.  Their efforts were part of a collaborative project between Aussie Ark, Re:wild, WildArk, and the Australian Reptile Park, that began after the Tasmanian devil population vanished entirely from mainland Australia.  Aussie Ark  Before Hemsworth and Pataky reintroduced the little marsupials to Australia, the last time a Tasmanian devil set a paw on Australia's mainland had been over 3,000 years ago. Since their reintroduction, the 11 animals have been monitored through regular surveys, radio collars fitted with transmitters, and camera traps.  Aussie Ark discovered Lisa's joeys through one of their routine health examinations.  Aussie Ark managing director Tim Faulkner explained in a news release: ""We were in the middle of routine devil health checks when we were overjoyed to discover Lisa had joeys.""  ""This is the very first confirmed devil joeys of 2023, and proof yet again that our breeding program and rewilding program is working,"" he added.  Aussie Ark  ""This is a great example of how returning a species to its wild home can rewild the entire ecosystem,"" Janice Chanson, a Re:wild senior associate of species conservation, shared in a statement. ""This is particularly important in combatting climate change and biodiversity loss and in improving the overall health of our planet.""  After the discovery, initial pouch checks showed that Lisa's joeys appeared in excellent health. Aussie Ark rangers are expected to continue monitoring Lisa through camera traps and will conduct follow-up pouch checks in the coming weeks.

Over the course of the next four days, Kim would go through a long process of induced labor.  Finally, at 3:35 a.m. on the morning of commencement, Aaliyah-Iris Tabaquin Jose entered the world weighing seven pounds three ounces.  “We joked afterwards that she was waiting because she wanted to make a grand entrance on the day of graduation,” Chris said.  Only a few hours after the birth, Chris’ joy would be immortalized forever as he appeared live on screen at the Global Campus commencement ceremony to raucous applause. He was standing in a hospital room, proudly holding Aaliyah-Iris in his arms with a huge smile on his face. Kim, lying in the hospital bed next to him, held his diploma cover.  Aaliyah-Iris Tabaquin Jose  “The whole day was a rollercoaster of emotions. We were anxious, excited, happy, and nervous, but felt overwhelming support from our families and the staff at the hospital,” said Chris. “I was also very tired. But most of all, I was just excited to share that memory with my daughter when she is older.”  “She graduated with me at just a few hours old, and who can say that? It’s a very special thing.”  Jose is no stranger to medical situations. He’s a veteran of the U.S. Navy, where he worked as a Hospital Corpsman before leaving active duty in 2018. He later worked as a CT scan and MRI technician at a Veteran’s Affairs Hospital in Portland and currently does the same job at a private clinic.  After leaving the Navy, Jose opted to use his military education benefits to begin taking classes at WSU’s Vancouver campus. Later, he would transfer to WSU Global Campus, deciding that the flexibility of online learning was the best fit for his work and family obligations.  “Earning my degree online was a great process and experience. Being able to access classes from different locations made it possible for me to provide for my family and earn a degree at the same time,” said Jose. “The transition from brick and mortar was easy because of the guidance of the academic advisors, the veteran’s affairs office at Vancouver and Pullman, and the professors who really worked with me and my schedule.”  Now that Jose is a Coug alum, he plans to use his degree to advance his career in medical care and possibly open doors to other fields.  Chris and his wife Kim  “I plan to use many of the skills I learned in my WSU courses to help with clinical coordination and promotion at my current job,” he said. “I also want to keep my options open as far as career paths in project management or administration. For me, it’s all about providing for my family.”  Jose is excited to start the next phase of his life as a father and a college graduate. He’s also grateful to those who supported him along the way.  “I want to thank and acknowledge my wife Kim for supporting me during my time at WSU, especially throughout her pregnancy,” he said. “I also want to thank my parents and my sister, who is also a WSU alum, for pushing me to continue school and see it through to graduation.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy53c3UuZWR1L25ld3MvMjAyMy8wNS8xNy9nbG9iYWwtY2FtcHVzLWdyYWQtcmVtb3RlbHktYXR0ZW5kcy1jb21tZW5jZW1lbnQtYWZ0ZXItYmlydGgtb2YtZGF1Z2h0ZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Content creator Bramty Juliette revealed that she wanted her husband and her mom around when she was welcoming her firstborn into this world. However, things didn’t go quite according to plan. The woman opened up about her experience on a podcast she co-hosts with her husband, the snippet of which was later uploaded on her TikTok account. Scroll down to find the video below.  In their viral video, content creator Bramty Juliette discussed her first childbirth experience with her husband  Image credits: nd3000  “The reason why I really didn’t like your mom back then”  Image credits: bramty  “I was giving birth to Penelope and I let his mom be in the room to watch me give birth, which was also a huge issue. ‘I don’t want your mom in the room. I only want you. I only want you and my mom in the room, you’re my husband, and my mom for emotional support.’ And he’s said, ‘I want my mom in the room.'”  “No, it’s not about you. It’s my mom, like, I want her in the room”  Image credits: bramty  “‘No, it’s not about you.’ And he didn’t really understand. She’s the one giving birth. And that wasn’t the case”  “When you give birth, it’s about the wife. She’s the one going through things physically, mentally”  Image credits: bramty  “At the moment, like my water breaks, I go to the hospital and it’s my first time giving birth. I’m 19 years old. I’m having contractions. I remember having contractions. And I was like, I’m gonna do birth without an epidural. So I try to push it through as long as I could. And at the time, I was just so focused on, my contractions.”  “We had my mom, you, your mom, your brother, and your aunt who I never spoke to in my whole life in the room, watching my birth”  Image credits: bramty  “Interviewer: ‘Cause it’s Cuban people. They just want to be, involved and think everything’s fine. Nothing’s taboo, everything’s fine.’  He should have had my back then. You should have had my back then. ‘All right, Bramty, you’re about to give birth. Everybody out. Only what my wife wants.’ But you didn’t have that mentality and you just had your mom’s back most of the time. So I remember I just wasn’t even involved with, who was in the room. I remember pushing.”  “I remember your mom and your aunt taking pictures of my vagina while I am pushing, then later finding out that your aunt had sent those pictures to family members”  Bramty’s TikTok video attracted over five million views  Having loved ones around during childbirth can make it a more positive experience  Image credits: Jonathan Borba (not the actual photo)  Bramty shared her story of giving birth on the newly-released BRAMTEA podcast that she hosts together with her husband Luis Espina. Previously known from their YouTube channel, titled The Bramfam, the couple discussed how—as Bramty stated in her video description—her mother-in-law ruined her childbirth experience.  The woman said she wanted her husband and her mother to be there in the room with her, which is not an unusual request. The World Health Organization (WHO) emphasized that support coming from the people the expectant mother trusts can help make labor and childbirth a more positive experience. The loved ones can aid her in numerous ways, including facilitating communication between the staff and the mom-to-be, providing practical and emotional support, and assisting with non-pharmacological pain relief methods, among other things.  Having a trustworthy person around can indeed help reduce discomfort, as research shows that there’s a positive correlation between a spouse’s participation in childbirth and pain relief. Moreover, the study pointed out that their presence is beneficial not only for the mother herself, but also for their partner, which is why the majority of spouses say they would participate in subsequent births as well.  Nowadays, quite a few dads are present during the birth of their child but that wasn’t always the case  Image credits: Craig Adderley (not the actual photo)  Positive effects of having a partner present during childbirth might be one of the reasons quite a few expectant mothers want them by their side during such a significant moment. Some research suggests that as much as 85% of women say they would like their husband to be there.  NPR pointed out that even though nowadays seeing fathers in the delivery room is quite common, it wasn’t as usual back in the day. Medical historian Judy Leavitt told NPR that traditionally giving birth was mostly a female event. Even when the births moved from home to the hospital in the 20th century, husbands would typically remain in the waiting rooms. According to the historian, fathers started staying around for the birth of their babies roughly in the ‘70s and ‘80s.  A 2016 study of the birth experience from the perspective of the fathers revealed that their attendance in childbirth had a positive effect on all of the main parties involved—the mother, the newborn, and the dads themselves. According to the study, as much as 94% of them were happy to be present for such an event. However, they admitted to feeling some extent of helplessness and fear as well, in addition being somewhat overwhelmed by the event.  Considering the benefits of having your partner by your side while giving birth, it’s understandable why Bramty wanted her husband around. She also wanted her mother to be there, who is arguably a person she trusts; and according to the World Health Organization, compassion and trustworthiness are two of the main characteristics that pregnant women seek in their companions during childbirth. The content creator might have not felt the same level of connection with her husband’s family. In addition to that, she didn’t appreciate some of their actions, which seemingly shocked quite a few people in the comments as well.  The online community had plenty to say about the situation  Some people shared stories about similar personal experiences","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvcmVkcGFuZGEuY29tL21pbC1ydWlucy1iaXJ0aC1leHBlcmllbmNlLWJyYW10eS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Here's LeBlanc's post below:  ChurchPOP first covered LeBlanc's story on April 25 after news surfaced she was expecting conjoined twins sharing one heart and vital organs.  She considered the pregnancy a gift from God and a unique opportunity to share the pro-life message.  “I believe my family has a very special mission to save as many babies as possible from the evils of abortion,” LeBlanc said. “We are the pro-life generation!”  LeBlanc shared several updates on social media before the delivery.  In the weeks prior, LeBlanc did not know how long the babies would live. Nicole and her husband, Austin, knew miscarriage was possible. They also hoped the babies would survive after she gave birth.  At 29 weeks pregnant, LeBlanc told ChurchPOP that doctors scheduled her c-section for June 2. However, due to slowed growth and slowed heartbeats, they moved the procedure to May 16.  Knowing the twins' condition, Nicole and Austin had a priest ""on standby"" for the sacraments of baptism and confirmation immediately after delivery.  They also made preparations for the cemetery and funeral home.  Here's Nicole's update the day before she gave birth:  The hospital just called me from the preemie department and told me that since they will be born at 32 weeks, their lungs are still immature and with their shared heart will make things more difficult. I’m making all of the preparations for the cemetery and funeral home now. — Nicole LeBlanc🇻🇦 (@nicolita_d) May 15, 2023  LeBlanc told followers that despite complications and an ""emotional eight months,"" she said ""being pregnant with two saints"" was ""totally worth it.""  Concluding her latest announcement, LeBlanc asked for the twins' intercession.  ""St. Maria Therese and Saint Rachel Clare, ora pro nobis. Austin and I love you more than you could ever know.

"birth","2023-03-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 00:19:00","MONTGOMERY, Ala. (WSFA) - Some Republican lawmakers want to define womanhood in state law. The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Susan DuBose, R-Jefferson County, calls her bill the What is a Woman Act, and she says the goal is to protect women. However, members of the LGBTQ community have said the goal is to erase the existence of transgender people.  The bill defines male and female based on someone’s biological sex at birth.  Andrea Trenaman was one of the many trans and cisgender women who spoke out against a bill that defines male and female based on someone’s sex at birth.  “This bill seeks to solve a problem that doesn’t exist. It implies that I, as a trans woman, am transitioning for nefarious purposes,” said Trenaman.  Trenaman is an engineer. Opponents are concerned about the state losing talent.  “It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to know this is a bad bill, but yet here I am,” said Trenaman.  “As far as branding, we’re not saying that we’re open for everyone,” said Rep. Jeremy Gray, D-Lee County.  DuBose says her bill still allows people to choose their gender and identity. She says gender identity is different than biological sex.  “This bill does not alter anyone’s legal rights. This bill does not create any new restrictions based on gender identity or transgender status,” said DuBose.  She says her goal is to protect women.  “If we don’t codify common sex-based terms, then laws that prohibit sex-based discrimination will cease to mean anything at all, and single-sex private spaces will cease to disappear,” said DuBose.  The only public proponent of the bill was Becky Gerritson with Eagle Forum Alabama.  “This law simply codifies biological reality,” said Gerritson.  Rep. Pebblin Warren, D-Lee County, says the state needs to focus on other things.  “We’re number 50 in education. We don’t have healthcare for people who are in need, and we’re sitting up here trying to tell somebody how to live their lives,” said Warren.  The committee plans to hold a vote on this bill next week. DuBose says there will be at least one amendment to define an unknown sex, for cases when a child’s sex cannot be determined at birth.

"birth","2022-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Italy"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 00:36:01","Rome (CNN) — Italy, a country once known for its big families gathered around the dinner table, is facing a crisis of unparalleled proportions.  For the first time, the number of births in a year fell below 400,000 – representing an average of 1.25 babies per woman, according to official figures for 2022.  This means that the replacement rate is now negative, since the number of deaths currently exceeds the number of births – 12 deaths for every seven births.  Italy is the world’s 8th largest economy and has a population of just under 60 million. In 2022, the southern European country registered just 393,000 babies, according to the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT), the lowest since records began in 1861.  Babies born in Italy to unregistered migrants and to some same-sex and heterosexual Italian couples who used surrogacy abroad are not automatically part of the official record, according to Italy’s national birth registrar.  And if the trend does not reverse itself, the country could face an economic “dark age,” as there will be a decline in the number of people entering the workforce even as more people retire.  “In our pension system, which is a pay-as-you-go system, where the current workers pay for the pension benefits of the current retired people, this will create a big challenge and burden,” Maria Rita Testa, a professor of demography at Luiss University in Rome, told CNN.  “The projections by the government show that the peak in terms of pension spending will be reached in 2044,” Testa said, to meet the needs of the large baby boomer generation.  By 2030, Italy can expect 2 million workers to have entered retirement with no corresponding new members of the workforce to pay their pensions, according to Testa.  The birth rate in Italy has been declining steadily since the economic crisis in 2008, for reasons demographers agree is rooted in economic insecurity. The average monthly income across Italy is €2,475 a month, according to ISTAT. But the average rental property is €12.12 ($13.16) per square meter, meaning a 100 square meter family apartment costs €1,212 ($1,316) – roughly half the monthly budget.  Italy also used to be a country of savers, with the average Italian saving 20% of annual income, according to ISTAT figures, in part because many families live in multi-generational homes or homes bought by their parents. But when the COVID-19 pandemic hit and Italy locked down, the annual savings rate dropped to just over 11% by July 2020, and dropped further, to just over 5% of annual income, as of January 2023, according to the World Bank and ISTAT.  For couples of child-bearing age, many of whom are just entering the workforce, that translates to hesitancy when it comes to starting a family. “For those who have to decide to make the transition to parenthood, to become parents, the big problem is to find a solid job [and] economic independence to allow them to get the credit to buy a house and to start building a family,” Testa said.  In order to spur a baby boom, the Italian government has been toying with incentives, starting with the government of Mario Draghi, which in May 2021 introduced monthly payments of up to €175 ($190) per child, a policy which has been continued by the government of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. Draghi’s plan included pumping $25.4 million into the economy to boost childcare and hire more women and young people.  But other countries, including Germany and France, do far more for potential parents, although that doesn’t always translate to higher birth rates. In Germany, where new parents can take up to three years of partially paid or unpaid maternity leave, the birth rate is just slightly higher than Italy, at an average of 1.4 babies per woman for the first half of 2022.  In France, the birth rate is higher at 1.8 children per woman, according to figures for 2022 from its national statistics agency.  The situation in Italy is unique for two reasons. The Catholic Church, which is a predominant political force, and the right-wing government under Meloni have both lamented the low birth rate, but have put up roadblocks to ways to remedy the situation.  Meloni’s government has promoted the traditional family, criticized assisted reproduction like surrogacy for both heterosexual and gay couples, and rejected the idea of offering birth right to immigrants, even to those born of permanent, tax-paying residents.  “I want a country where it’s not scandalous to say we are still born from a man and a woman and where it’s not a taboo to say that maternity is not for sale or that we don’t rent uteruses,” Meloni said last week at a conference to address the dwindling birth rate.  Pope Francis, who also attended the conference, said that a lack of births meant a lack of hope, and hinted at the idea that “acceptance and inclusion” beyond Italian borders could help populate the country.  Italy is undergoing an unprecedented surge in irregular migration, with 45,510 people arriving in Italy by sea between January 1 and May 16 this year.  None of those arriving are guaranteed asylum or protection unless they undergo a lengthy asylum process. And none of the babies born during that process will be counted in Italy’s demographic statistics or integrated into Italian society, because they are now kept in migrant camps after Italy declared a state of emergency last month.  Francesco Lollobrigida, Meloni’s brother-in-law and the country’s minister of agriculture, raised eyebrows last month when he suggested that Italians “were at risk of ethnic replacement” if migration wasn’t put in check. “That’s not the way forward,” he said.  Claudia Giagheddu Saitta, 27, and Gabriele De Luca, 31, are concerned about raising a family with so many uncertainties. Tax cuts on baby products and birth incentives aren’t enough, they say.  “The government thinks €10,000 ($10,800) is enough to have a child. But the incentives are temporary. A child lasts forever,” Giagheddu Saitta says. She says the idea of having more than one child, if she has one at all, feels impossible.  De Luca blames the government for not doing enough for the younger generation, in part because decades of low birth rates have made the youth a minority. He says that because governments are voted in by people in their 50s, 60s and 70s, their interests come first. “The government has to take risks. They have to take unpopular decisions if they really want to stimulate growth. They have to represent the side of the youth.”  Less than one quarter of women born in 1980, who are now 43, have children, according to the national birth registrar. Some want children, but can’t afford them, and others are choosing to remain childless.  Italian mothers are the oldest in Europe and, according to a number of professionals CNN spoke to, it is because they feel they need to reach a certain level of financial and a work stability before they’re comfortable starting a family, which is usually in their 30s.  Testa fears that the low birth rate is contagious. It used to be that foreigners living in Italy had far more children than Italian women, but now they are adapting to the economic climate and aligning with the Italian birth rate.  “The low fertility trap says if women and men get used to small family size it might become the ideal, the reference model,” she says. “And if it is a reference model, the one child family, the fertility (rate) will even go lower and create a downward spiral of low fertility.”  The-CNN-Wire™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

"birth","2023-05-12","Not Discerned","{""Haines"", ""Alaska"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 08:25:13","We are entering the OTHER moose season. Calves are being born, and they should be left alone.  Mother’s day, it’s not just for humans. Moose cows are giving birth around this time. And experts say, we should watch out. Carl Koch is a wildlife biologist with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, and he warns that the animals can be particularly touchy when they have newly born calves.  Koch: “When they first give birth, the calf has to build muscle until it can grow strong enough to run from danger. The most common thing they’ll do is bed down when they are in trouble, mom knows they can’t run away, so she’ll get very defensive.”  Koch says the cow’s most common defense is to stomp on whatever is threatening their calf. A moose can kick in any direction with its front hooves.  Koch says that cows frequently leave their calves alone for a day, knowing they will not be able to go far. Sometimes people will find a calf in this situation and assume it is orphaned.  Koch: “Interfering in that can make matters worse.”  Koch remembers one occasion a few years ago in Haines, when people crowded around a calf. He says this probably prevented the mother from reuniting with her newborn.  Koch: “ “They may just abandon the calf, they often have twins, so they might just cut their losses if one of them is in a spot where they are having trouble getting back to it because people aren’t leaving it alone. When folks call and say there is a calf in their backyard and they are worried about it, I say leave it alone, and if they have pets, I say please keep the dogs out of the backyard. Some folks want to keep checking on it every hour, we prefer they just leave it alone.”  He says almost every time, within a day and a half they will have moved on. Koch says of all the moose charges he hears about, around half occur at this time of year. He got a report of one person with a loose dog being charged by a cow this Tuesday in Gustavus.  Cows will generally give birth to their first calf two or three years after their own birth. They will get pregnant in September during the breeding -and hunting- season, and give birth mid-May. That makes their pregnancy about the same length as a human’s. But they do it almost every year. In an area with plentiful food, like the Chilkat Valley near Haines, Koch estimates that up to 90% of females of breeding age will give birth in any one year. With the valley’s moose population around 350 individuals, Koch guesses about a hundred calves could be born this spring.  The calves will weigh the same as a mid size dog. They will get milk from their mother, but can also eat leafy plants, like willow and dogwood, just after birth. As they age, they progressively shift to an all plant diet. Koch says around one in three calves will survive the summer.  Adult females can reach over a thousand pounds, and live up to seventeen years in the wild.  For anyone running into one of the irritable new mothers, Koch has one piece of advice.  Koch: “If a moose is charging you, do the opposite of what you do with a bear. Run and get behind something big.”  Koch likes to keep tabs on these encounters. He says every year in Alaska, some people are injured by moose. He asks that any dangerous interaction with a moose be reported to the state’s Department of Fish and Game, or the Alaska Wildlife Troopers.  Koch wants to remind the public to leave all wild animals alone.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiKWh0dHBzOi8va2hucy5vcmcvaXRzLWJpcnRoLXRpbWUtZm9yLW1vb3Nl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"birth","2018-07-26","Not Discerned","{""Boston"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 16:46:58","Editor's Note: This is an excerpt from WBUR's weekly health newsletter, CommonHealth. If you like what you read and want it in your inbox, sign up here.  At a time when reproductive health can feel increasingly politicized and polarized in American society, a landmark change may be around the corner without a big, flashy debate: over-the-counter birth control pills.  Last week, one of the Food and Drug Administration’s advisory committees voted unanimously to support making one type of birth control medication available over-the-counter, switching away from prescription-only status. It’s taken “Free the Pill” advocates nearly two decades to get here. And many of them did not expect the FDA to consider this change against the backdrop of an intense abortion debate.  “There are so many hostile attacks on sexual reproductive health care. So, as an advocate, it’s surprising when we might actually be very close to a win,” Candace Gibson, of the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Justice, told me.  I found myself fascinated by why there is not more organized opposition. So, I started asking around.  It turns out that both Republicans and Democrats have come out in favor of making the pill available without a prescription. When I reached out to March for Life, an anti-abortion organization, I got a short email saying the group “doesn’t take a position on birth control.” Same with the conservative Massachusetts Family Institute.  Then I spoke to Elizabeth Janiak, a researcher at Harvard’s School of Public Health, who has been tracking the issue. She assured me that many people involved in grassroots organizing against abortion also oppose contraception — and they often oppose it “just as fervently.” But “they have not chosen to make their opposition to contraception a major political goal,” she quickly added.  She had a few explanations for why. She said some conservatives — who oppose the Affordable Care Act requirement that insurance companies cover the cost of certain preventative health services — think of over-the-counter birth control as a “free market” alternative. It is seen as evidence that not all people need health insurance since there are other ways to access preventive care.  Another explanation for the lack of opposition, Janiak said, is that the pill is just too common — it’s taken daily by millions in the U.S.  “Because it’s so widely used and because it has been used for so long, pretty much everyone either has used the pill or knows someone who has. And so we can all say from our own personal experience, ‘Yeah, this drug seems perfectly safe,’ ” Janiak said.  Of course, there’s the religious perspective to consider, too. The Catholic Church is opposed to hormonal contraception and has been the main opposition to taking the pill over-the-counter. But evangelical groups that have been a driving force in efforts to ban abortion often don’t oppose contraception.  I spoke with some evangelical activists who said the pill is widely used within their circles. Some of them said the community is slowly waking up to “moral problems with the pill,” but — currently — there is no large-scale opposition.  This lack of consensus within conservative religious groups, some observers surmise, is keeping many grassroots organizations from taking a strong stance on the topic. (As I mentioned in a newsletter last summer, evangelical groups have said there should be an age restriction if the pill becomes available without a prescription.)  Even if the politics of the pill and abortion are very different, Janiak warned that nothing is happening in a silo. She said where things land in the legal battle over the abortion medication mifepristone — and what the case signals about whether judges can overrule FDA decisions — could make a difference for potential future legal challenges to an FDA decision on the pill. But first, the FDA has to make the switch official. That decision is expected this summer.

"birth","2023-04-25","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 17:09:46","Healthcare is expensive. Debates about reducing healthcare costs are perennial, with a seemingly endless supply of proposals. Last July, Elizabeth Bruenig of The Atlantic provocatively proposed that Americans – especially those in the Pro-Life movement – should “agree that pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum care should all be free, and demand that the federal government make it so.”  Variations of Bruenig’s proposal have circulated in subsequent months, and on April 25th, The Institute for Human Ecology at the Catholic University of America hosted a panel discussion titled “Should Birth Be Free?” Matthew Walther , editor of The Lamp, moderated the discussion. Tom Shakeley, Chief Engagement Officer at Americans United for Life (AUL), argued in favor of government-funded birth. AUL has published suggestions for how Congress could take steps to eliminate the costs of births for American families. Washington Post columnist Megan McArdle was skeptical of the efficacy of such a program.  Shakeley – who referenced Bruenig’s piece multiple times during the panel – began his argument with an emphasis on community, suggesting that birth is not an abstract concept; rather, babies are human persons born into particular families and communities.  According to Shakeley, eliminating the medical cost of births “is a way to strengthen our social fabric, not just for families, but for our whole country.” Shakeley believes the inherent goodness of birth for both families and society at large needs to be emphasized, especially amidst post-Dobbs debates about abortion. He suggested that publicly funding births would help change public opinion on these topics and provide a “substantive” Pro-Life policy. Shakeley also highlighted the threat of depopulation as a reason for supporting such a policy, as well as the potential GDP benefits of more children in the United States.  While Shakeley’s arguments were optimistically philosophical, McArdle’s were more pragmatic. McArdle noted agreement with Shakeley on various points but ultimately disagreed on the benefits of government-funded birth.  “I don’t think that making birth free solves any particular problem,” McArdle said, characterizing such a policy as primarily symbolic. She noted that many births are already government-funded through Medicaid, and stated her belief that medical insurance should “cover expenses that most people don’t have,” which would exclude births.  McArdle also suggested families could still have to pay birth costs through taxes or insurance premiums. “Someone’s got to pay for it one way or other, and that someone is going to be, by and large, the same people who are having the babies.”  Moving to larger scale issues, McArdle noted the tenuous long-term status of other government programs like Social Security and stated that covering birth expenses “adds a burden onto the government when the government is not yet prepared to finance the burdens that it’s already taken on.”  Shakeley countered that funding births would only add $40-50 billion to the annual federal budget, a small percentage of federal healthcare spending. McArdle granted this point, but still expressed concerns about adding even marginal spending. She expressed further concerns about excess government involvement in healthcare, citing logistical issues revealed by the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.  McArdle also spoke against Shakeley’s belief that government-funded births would encourage Americans to have more children, suggesting there are other reasons for decreasing birth rates in recent years. She suggested that there is little evidence that these other, mostly cultural, reasons for low birth rates would be aided much by government programs which “give people big chunks of cash for having kids.”  Shakeley responded by citing examples of government policies changing society, noting the impact of the interstate system and public schools. He also expanded on his previous comments regarding societal goods, suggesting that making births free would promote the common good just as previous policies had.  In response to an audience question pushing her on the role of the government, McArdle noted that the government can affect culture. She reiterated that she did not believe government-funded birth would notably affect culture.  McArdle also cited anecdotal evidence to support her position: “When I talk to people in their 20s who are delaying marriage and family, the cost of giving birth has, I think, literally never come up.”  Both Shakeley and McArdle presented compelling points supporting their respective positions, and their discussion highlighted various key philosophical and economic factors surrounding debates about whether birth should be free for families – factors which conservative or conservative-leaning people may disagree about (McArdle mostly referred to herself as a libertarian, but often expressed socially conservative personal views).

Though it wasn’t her preference, her doctor advised that they plan a cesarean section.  “At the time, there were some doctors out there who could do a twin birth vaginally—I just couldn’t find them and I didn’t know what I was doing,” Chaffee recalls. “Everyone would say, ‘Talk to a midwife!’”  Ultimately, after an extensive search, Chaffee found a midwife who was able to assist her during pregnancy and labor.  “It went beautifully,” she says, admitting that if she had only had one baby, or was lower risk, she might not have considered working with one.  Today, Chaffee serves on the board of directors for Maryland Families for Safe Birth (MFSB), a grassroots organization created in 2011 with the hopes of passing legislation for the licensure of Certified Professional Midwives (now known as Direct Entry Midwives or DEMs) in Maryland, which was accomplished in 2015. “Midwives can offer very individualized care, which can sometimes be hard to for doctors when they’re serving the masses,” says Evelyn Fielding, also on MFSB’s board of directors.  Thanks to the group’s determination, access to legal and safe homebirth care has been increased significantly throughout the state in the past eight years. In addition, the group says it’s made strides in fostering stronger relationships between midwives and OB-GYNs—making the transfer from prenatal care to the delivery room more safe and seamless for parents who choose that trajectory.  But there’s much more work to be done with regard to the organization’s overall goal, which is to advocate for all Marylanders to make personalized, evidence-based decisions about what maternity care works best for them. As Fielding points out, for minorities, the stakes are alarmingly higher. According to the Maryland Patient Safety Center, Black Women are two times more likely than White Women to face severe complications during pregnancy, and three-to-four times more likely to die as a result of them.  “We’re committed to working on health disparities and equity issues within the medical system,” Fielding adds.  With this mission at the forefront, in 2019, MFSB hosted its first-ever Baltimore Birth Festival, an event which aims to offer families and new parents inclusive tools to help with pregnancy, birthing, and postpartum care. On Sunday, May 21, the free festival—which wavered for a bit due to the pandemic—is returning to Patterson Park in an effort to forge a village of resources for new parents.  “Our target was to have an event where we could bring together all kinds of birth workers—people who would service families from pregnancy through postpartum to having young children ages zero to five,” Fielding says, citing similar events like the Birth and Babies Fair in Frederick, hosted by Maryland nonprofit The Birthing Circle. “We kind of modeled it after that—having a beautiful outdoor festival where local families can come and learn about these resources.”  From 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., families can get to know visitors including Odile Penet and Kristie Graybill of The Womb Room in Hampden; Katy Linda of The Rumina Center for postpartum wellness in Cross Keys; pelvic floor specialist Dr. Sam DuFlo of Indigo Physiotherapy in Roland Park; and fitness experts from mom and me-inspired exercise program FIT4MOM Baltimore City.  Little ones can enjoy bubble-blowing, hula-hooping, and coloring, along with tunes by kid-friendly musician Mr. Jon and tricks by magician Eric Henning. Attendees who check in will receive two raffle tickets to win baby gear like carriers and wraps. They will also have a chance to purchase $30 swag bags filled with baby items, product samples, coupons, and more raffle tickets.  Fielding hopes the afternoon will help birthers and their families to feel more in control of their individualized birthing experiences.  “Many people are familiar with what a doula or a midwife is, but finding those providers can be difficult if you don’t know where to look,” says Fielding, “This is a great place to [connect with them.] We’re spreading the word that there is support out there for people who need it.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iYWx0aW1vcmVtYWdhemluZS5jb20vc2VjdGlvbi9jb21tdW5pdHkvYmFsdGltb3JlLWJpcnRoLWZlc3RpdmFsLXBhdHRlcnNvbi1wYXJrLWluY2x1c2l2ZS1yZXNvdXJjZXMtZm9yLWV4cGVjdGFudC1wYXJlbnRzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"birth","2001-07-22","Not Discerned","{""FountainHills"", ""Arizona"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 11:01:20","In two months, Lauren Weintraub will begin taking care of babies born prematurely — alongside the nurse who cared for her 22 years ago.  Lauren and her twin brother, David, spent the first four months of their lives in the neonatal intensive care unit at St. Luke’s University Hospital in Fountain Hill after their birth in March 2001.  They were delivered by emergency caesarean section at 29 weeks. Lauren was just 1 pound, 10 ounces; David was 2 pounds, 13 ounces.  Among the nurses who cared for them was Susan Foster.  In July, Weintraub, newly graduated from the nursing program at Cedar Crest College, will join Foster as a NICU nurse at St. Luke’s-Allentown.  Now 22, Weintraub graduated Saturday. Just before the ceremony, Foster, who inspired and supported Weintraub on her journey through nursing school, was the one to place a pin on her during the pinning ceremony.  “I took care of Lauren as a baby at the start of my career as a NICU nurse,” the 65-year-old Foster said. “I’m at the tail end of my career but to know that I’ll be working with her at the bedside is incredible. To have the opportunity to pass on the knowledge I’ve gained over the years, it’s amazing.”  It won’t be the first time they’ve worked together. During Weintraub’s final clinical rotation at the Allentown campus, Foster served as her nurse preceptor, the person who watched over her and helped her put what she learned in nursing school into practice.  “I learned from the best of the best of the best,” Weintraub said.  As a NICU nurse with more than 20 years of experience and a mother to children who were born prematurely, Foster knows what it’s like to provide and receive excellent care in the NICU.  In 1989 she gave birth to twin boys at 29 weeks gestation, an experience that changed her life forever.  “I barely even knew what a NICU was, to be honest with you, but I was inspired by the nurses that took care of my boys. They were incredible,” Foster said. “It was truly probably one of the scariest times of my life but those nurses were amazing. They became my family.”  At the time, Foster was a flight attendant, but she decided on a career change. She went back to school and became a nurse in 1998. She started working in the NICU at St. Luke’s University Hospital in 2000.  “I couldn’t think of anything else that was more important to me than giving a little baby a chance at a great life like those nurses did for my boys,” Foster said.  Both of Weintraub’s parents are nurses, and Weintraub said from an early age she knew she wanted to do something health care related. The NICU stayed close to Weintraub’s heart as she was growing up. Every year on Christmas Eve, she and her brother would visit with cookies for the nurses.  “They loved seeing how much we’d grown each year and the new things we were doing,” Weintraub said.  But the Bethlehem native said she didn’t know she wanted to be a NICU nurse until middle school, when she volunteered in the Fountain Hill campus NICU through the St. Luke’s March of Dimes program.  “All of those nurses inspired me, just the way that they handled those babies and their natural ability to calm them and care for them was absolutely amazing to me,” Weintraub said. “And I realized how much I loved being there and I love sharing my story with parents in the NICU. We found that it was really inspiring to them and it gave them a sense of hope when they were struggling.”  Foster said during the clinical rotation, she saw Weintraub’s natural affinity for the job. She’s proud of the woman and nurse Weintraub has become.  “She can really put parents at ease,” Foster said. “One time she shared her story with parents and they couldn’t believe it, that she had been born at 29 weeks and was premature but here she was.”  Morning Call reporter Leif Greiss can be reached at 610-679-4028 or lgreiss@mcall.com.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tY2FsbC5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8xNi9ib3JuLXByZW1hdHVyZWx5LXNoZS1zcGVudC00LW1vbnRocy1pbi1zdC1sdWtlcy1uaWN1LXNoZS1yZXR1cm5zLWFzLWEtbnVyc2UtYWxvbmdzaWRlLXRoZS13b21hbi13aG8tY2FyZWQtZm9yLWhlctIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Mental health challenges can come unexpectedly and look different for everyone. They may appear at a time that is considered to be one of the happiest of your life, the birth of a baby. A new baby can bring big changes that cause a stir of emotions, from excitement to joy and fear to anxiety.  For one East Texas mother, the feelings were more severe and lasted longer.  “I really couldn’t do much. Like, I didn’t have much of a functioning capability, really, just to do day-to-day adult life things. They were hard,” a nurse at UT Health East Texas, Alyssa Brown, said. ” Eventually, I started having suicidal thoughts. Never tried to; never had a plan, necessarily, but I knew all of it was not normal.”  Brown gave birth to her baby while working as a nurse for UT Health East Texas in 2018. That’s around the time, she experienced postpartum depression.  Health officials say it can be mistaken for “baby blues,” but the symptoms are more intense and last longer. According to the C.D.C., one out of every eight new moms experience postpartum depression after giving birth.  For Brown, besides taking medication, she also decided to do therapy.  “I think therapy is what saved me for sure, what helped me just to learn,” Brown said. “How to think what I was thinking, you know, and how to process it and get past it.”  If you’re experiencing postpartum depression or if your “baby blues” don’t go away after two weeks, the C.D.C recommends getting in touch with your primary doctor.

An autopsy on the baby listed the cause and manner of the death as “undetermined,” according to a complaint warrant by the Scott County Sheriff’s Office.  Holtzclaw is accused of working alongside the juvenile, who is also charged in the case, to “conceal the child’s entire existence altogether, and/ or prevent the determination of whether it was born dead or alive,” according to the complaint.  Investigators wrote in the complaint that Holtzclaw and the juvenile admitted that they buried the baby in the backyard after birth between Dec. 5 and Dec. 6 of 2022.  The two are accused of attempting to bury the baby in a shoe box, but upon realizing the box wasn’t big enough they put the body in a plastic Dollar Tree shopping bag before burying it, according to the complaint.  Investigators allege that the actions of Holtzclaw and the juvenile contributed to the decomposition that prevented an autopsy from determining the baby’s cause of death, according to the complaint.  Holtzclaw is also accused of sending explicit videos to the juvenile he was in a “relationship” with and receiving explicit images in return, according to a separate complaint.  “Holtzclaw told investigators it was his opinion that it wasn’t right that he could legally have intercourse with the juvenile girlfriend, yet still be held accountable for having sexual performance imagery on his SnapChat or cellular device would get him into legal trouble,” an investigator wrote in the complaint warrant. “Holtzclaw told this investigator that we should change that law as in his opinion it was ‘not right.’”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxleDE4LmNvbS9uZXdzL3ZlcnNhaWxsZXMtbWFuLWFjY3VzZWQtb2YtaGF2aW5nLWJhYnktd2l0aC1qdXZlbmlsZS1kaXNwb3Npbmctb2YtYmFieXMtYm9kedIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"birth","2022-12-05","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 13:06:03","As Court Considers Child’s Adoption, Father Cannot Seek Visitation Rights from Another Court  A county juvenile court cannot grant visitation rights to the father of a child when placement for adoption was approved by a probate court in a nearby county, the Supreme Court of Ohio ruled today.  In a 6-1 decision, the Supreme Court blocked the Logan County Family Court from considering providing Kaidan Whitrock parenting time with an infant that is being adopted by a Van Wert County family selected by the birth mother. Whitrock lost his attempt to block the adoption when the Supreme Court decided in December 2022 that he waited too long to act after the adoption petition was filed.  The Court’s per curiam opinion noted that Whitrock sought the help of the Logan County court after the Van Wert County Probate Court would not allow him to participate in the adoption case when he requested to intervene. The Court wrote that instead of seeking help from another court, Whitrock could appeal the rejection of his right to intervene.  Chief Justice Sharon L. Kennedy and Justices R. Patrick DeWine, Michael P. Donnelly, Melody Stewart, Jennifer Brunner, and Joseph T. Deters joined the per curiam opinion. Justice Patrick F. Fischer dissented without a written opinion.  Click to Expand  Parenting Rights Considered After Adoption Request Submitted  Josephine Davis gave birth to a child identified in court records as “H.P.” in 2020. She was 17 years old at the time. Davis was not married to Whitrock, who was 18 years old, and presumed to be the child’s biological father. Whitrock’s paternity had not been established when H.P. was born.  To address paternity disputes, Ohio lawmakers established a Putative Father Registry in 1996 in R.C. 3107.061 et seq. Under this law, a father’s consent to the adoption of a minor child is not required unless the father registers with the putative father registry no later than 15 days after the child is born.  Three days after the birth of H.P., the married couple chosen by Davis filed a petition in the Van Wert County Probate Court to adopt the newborn baby. As the adoption request was pending, the probate court issued a placement order that granted the couple “care, custody, and control” over H.P., and Whitrock filed an objection to the adoption.  About two weeks after the adoption petition was filed, Whitrock asked Logan County Family Court Judge Natasha Kennedy to give parental rights and responsibilities to him, including authorizing genetic testing to determine paternity. While some counties have separate courts for matters dealing with children, the Logan County Family Court has combined jurisdiction over juvenile, domestic relations, and probate matters.  The genetic test results confirmed Whitrock is H.P.’s biological father. Judge Kennedy of Logan County stayed all action on Whitrock’s request for parental rights until after the Van Wert County probate court ruled in the H.P. adoption case. In January 2021, the Van Wert court denied Whitrock’s motion to intervene and ruled his consent was not required to grant the adoption.  Visitation Rights Case Resumed After Supreme Court Decision  Whitrock’s appeal of the Van Wert court’s decision to keep him out of the adoption case reached the Supreme Court in 2022. The Court remanded the matter to the Third District Court of Appeals, and in turn, the Third District remanded the case to the Van Wert probate court to consider whether Whitrock could claim his right to object to the adoption as the biological father of H.P.  The probate court is still considering the issue. As it does, Whitrock asked the Logan County Family Court to issue temporary orders granting him parenting time with H.P. and to move forward in determining if he should be granted custody.  H.P.’s mother and the adopting couple asked the Supreme Court for a writ of prohibition to prevent Judge Kennedy of Logan County from acting in the case. The mother and couple argued that the decisions regarding H.P. are solely to be made by the probate court in Van Wert.  Supreme Court Analyzed Roles of Multiple Courts in Adoption Cases  The per curiam opinion explains the Supreme Court must determine if the Logan County court is empowered to make decisions without interfering with the Van Wert court’s authority.  The Supreme Court explained that in general, only one court can have jurisdiction over a case at a time. In matters where it is possible that two or more courts could have the authority to consider a case, the general rule is the court that acts first is the one empowered to decide the case.  However, where two courts do not have the same powers the rule does not apply, the opinion stated. A probate court and a juvenile court have separate powers, and can both act, the opinion stated. Because the Logan County Family Court has the combined powers of three divisions, Judge Kennedy has some powers through her juvenile court responsibilities to “proceed with matters relevant to and in aid of the adoption proceedings,” the Supreme Court found.  Judge Kennedy has the power to determine the paternity of a child born out of wedlock and her finding that Whitrock was the biological father by use of genetic testing was not contested. However, the mother and the couple disputed Judge Kennedy’s right to decide matters beyond determining paternity, the opinion noted.  The Supreme Court ruled that the preadoption placement of H.P. with the couple was made by the Van Wert probate court. Once the probate court granted the placement, the probate court gained the exclusive right to determine the best interests of H.P.  Both the Logan County and Van Wert County courts contend they have the jurisdiction to determine the best interests of the child. The Supreme Court found any attempt by the Logan County court to grant visitation rights to Whitrock would be based on the assessment that it is in the best interest of H.P. By examining the best interests of H.P., the Logan County court is interfering with the Van Wert court’s right to determine the best interests of H.P., the opinion stated.  Any determination of whether Whitrock’s right to parenting time is in H.P.’s best interest is an issue that only the probate court in Van Wert can consider, the Court ruled.  In response to the mother and adopting couple’s attempt to prohibit her from acting, the Logan County judge argued that she must make the decision to consider Whitrock’s rights because the probate court denied Whitrock’s right to intervene and participate in the placement case.  The Supreme Court ruled that the Van Wert probate court’s decision to deny Whitrock’s participation does not create a right for the Logan Count Family Court to act on the matter. Whitrock instead should address his objections through the probate court, and any rights he has to appeal that court’s decisions, the Supreme Court concluded.  2022-0232. State ex rel. Davis v.

His was an emergency c-section, but this one we knew right away once I had my anatomy scan that a vbac was not a safe option for me or the baby.”  Raven concluded her post by writing, “With that being said, I think mothers who want an elected c-section should not be shamed, and we should just wish the best on any birth plan/decisions a mom makes. Whether she chose it or it was chosen for her.”  Couldn’t agree more, and we’re sending the entire Gottschalk family our love.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL2JhY2hlbG9ybmF0aW9uLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE2L3JhdmVuLWdhdGVzLWdldHMtY2FuZGlkLWFib3V0LWlzc3VlLXdpdGgtaGVyLXBsYWNlbnRhLWFuZC13aHktc2hlLW5lZWRzLWFub3RoZXItYy1zZWN0aW9uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"birth","2023-07-12","12:00:00","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 03:13:00","Is public or private healthcare the best choice when giving birth? (Source: Getty)  More than half of Ausssie parents were inclined to choose the public system when giving birth, according to new research by Finder .  According to Finder’s Parenting Report 2023, which surveyed 1,033 Australian parents of children under 12, 62 per cent said they would go through the public system if they were to have another child.  The research found one in four would go the private route, while one in 10 were on the fence.  Those who have previously gone with private healthcare paid, on average, more than three times as much in out-of-pocket fees ($2,394) than those who took the public path ($726).  Finder health insurance expert James Martin said the decision to have a child was one of life’s most significant milestones, and everyone had their own preferences when choosing to give birth.  “It really depends on personal circumstances but cost and choice are usually the two determining factors when choosing between a public or private birth,” Martin said.  “Some say the main advantage of going private for childbirth is that you can access a more individual level of care. This includes having your own room where your partner can remain at your side throughout your stay in the hospital.  “On the other hand, while you’re guaranteed your own obstetrician, the medical professionals are just as qualified in the public sector as they are in the private sector.”  Why parents said they would choose public  While cost was the number one reason for almost half (46 per cent) who said they would go public, almost two in five said the quality of treatment and care was just as good as going private.  Flexibility around seeing a different medical team (7 per cent) and not choosing an obstetrician (6 per cent) were other reasons some chose to stick with the public system.  Story continues  Why parents said they would choose private  On the other end of the spectrum, 16 per cent of those who said they would go private said it was down to better quality treatment and care.  The ability to choose an obstetrician (15 per cent) and access to a private room (15 per cent) were other determining factors.  Martin said a major difference between the two was the out-of-pocket fees.  “The cost of childbirth in a private hospital is far greater than in the public system, where it’s typically free under Medicare,” he said.  Martin said it was important to account for the costs involved in the private system.  “For one, you’ll need to pay more while you see out your insurance policy’s waiting period. For most, this means at least 12 months of higher premiums while holding a Gold health insurance policy that covers childbirth.  “Your total costs can run into several thousand dollars once you factor in out-of-pocket costs.  “These can include payments for physio visits, antenatal classes and lactation consultant appointments. Plus, you’ll need to pay your policy’s excess when making a claim at the private hospital.”  Follow Yahoo Finance on Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram and Twitter, and subscribe to our free daily newsletter.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vYXUuZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9jaGlsZGJpcnRoLWNvc3RzLXdoYXRzLXRoZS1wcmljZS1kaWZmZXJlbmNlLWZvci1wdWJsaWMtdnMtcHJpdmF0ZS0wMzEzNTI5NzAuaHRtbNIBemh0dHBzOi8vYXUuZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vYW1waHRtbC9uZXdzL2NoaWxkYmlydGgtY29zdHMtd2hhdHMtdGhlLXByaWNlLWRpZmZlcmVuY2UtZm9yLXB1YmxpYy12cy1wcml2YXRlLTAzMTM1Mjk3MC5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"birth","2023-07-12","Not Discerned","{""Springfield"", ""Missouri"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 09:07:07","Thirty-five states, including Missouri, have fewer children than they did five years ago, a situation caused by declining birth rates nationwide, but also by young families migrating across state borders in search of cheaper housing.  Even in the 15 states that gained children, all but North Dakota experienced greater growth in the adult population, meaning children now make up a lower percentage of residents.  In states where the number of children has declined, school officials are facing the possibility of teacher layoffs or even school closures when pandemic aid expires next year. A decline in school enrollment could provide short-term cost savings and might be a benefit to children if there are more resources to go around, but it bodes poorly for future state workforces.  In states where the drop in the number of children is part of a broader population decline, there will be additional fiscal, economic and political ramifications, such as diminished representation in Congress.  The states with the largest drops were California, Illinois and New Mexico, where the child population declined by 6 percent between 2017 and 2022, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data. Idaho and North Dakota saw the largest increases, at 4 percent.  The declines mostly are a reflection of historically low fertility rates, which have been below the replacement rate of two children per woman since 2010. Births increased in only a handful of states in 2021.  But in the 35 states that experienced declines, high housing prices also are a factor. In California, jobs pay well but the state's housing shortage has sent prices beyond the means of young families, said Hans Johnson, a senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California, a nonpartisan think tank.  ""People want to buy a house and have children, but they realize they can't do it here so they look in the vicinity, states close by, and work remotely so they can keep their California paychecks,"" Johnson said.  Slow population growth cost California a seat in Congress after the 2020 census. The number of adults in California grew in the past five years, according to the Stateline analysis, but the decline in the number of children led to a lower overall population.  California also has experienced a phenomenon shared by other Western states: The children of Hispanic immigrants have lower birth rates than their parents. California's total fertility rate dropped from 2.15 per woman in 2008 to a historic low of 1.52 in 2020, the lowest since records have been kept, Johnson wrote in a January report.  California, Illinois and New Mexico all have seen lower school enrollment in recent years, even as they've tried to rekindle interest in public education after pandemic upheavals.  In New Mexico, enrollment has dropped particularly sharply in the northwestern part of the state, where there are many Indigenous students, according to a January state report. Between 2012-2022, enrollment declined by 22 percent in the majority-Native Central Consolidated Schools in San Juan County, compared with a statewide decline of 7 percent, according to the report. Indigenous and other children in the mostly rural area struggle to stay in school because of long bus commutes and lack of internet access at home.  The recent closure of a coal mine and the power generating station it fueled forced many families with children to move away from San Juan County to find jobs, according to Central Consolidated school board President Christina Aspaas.  ""A lot of Navajo workers who were employed had to relocate to Phoenix or elsewhere out of state to earn the same wages,"" Aspaas said. ""It affected the local tribes, Hopi and Navajo, Diné. Seeing the impacts makes my heart break. These are all my children, and they deserve the best in education and in life.""  In Idaho and North Dakota, annual school enrollment has increased over the past five years, except for temporary drops early in the pandemic. But Idaho is bracing for a decline starting in 2025, when children from a historic 2007 baby boom in the state start turning 18.  Idaho has become known as a picturesque and affordable place to raise children, said Jaap Vos, a planning professor at the University of Idaho in Boise. He relocated from Florida with his 3-year-old son in 2012, ""when it was still the middle of nowhere,"" he said. The number of adults in the state grew by 16 percent during the same period.  Boise is getting a lot of new residents from California, and northern Idaho is seeing more movers from Northern California, Washington and Utah. ""It might be for ideological reasons, people looking for a more conservative lifestyle,"" Vos said. He added that some people have left Boise as it has grown more crowded.  Even in northern Idaho, housing prices have risen rapidly.  Writer Leah Hampton is moving from North Carolina to Moscow in northern Idaho to teach at the University of Idaho. But she said she is having trouble finding an affordable house -- even without children. Her husband is working remotely.  ""Moscow is definitely a great place to raise kids. It's like a 1950s movie up here but more diverse and left wing,"" Hampton said. ""All of my friends' children seem really happy and well-adjusted. But cost of living is much higher than we expected. We have money, and we literally can't find anything to buy.""  Many houses are sold sight unseen to investors offering cash, she said.  Another fast-growing state with meager growth in the number of children is Florida, where a decrease in births and an increase in deaths over the past five years has created a negative drag on overall population, according to census estimates. The state had almost 25,000 more births than deaths in 2017, but there were 40,000 more deaths than births by 2022.  Still, Florida had the third-highest increase in child population between 2017 and 2022, at 2 percent. One reason: Hispanic births in Florida have continued to increase, unlike in Western states, said Stefan Rayer, director of the population program at the state Bureau of Economic and Business Research. In fact, births are increasing for white, Black and Hispanic mothers in Florida, helping to offset some of the increasing deaths among the white population, Rayer said.  ""Unless births increase substantially, because of the aging of Florida's population, the state will likely see natural decrease for the foreseeable future, with all growth coming from migration,"" Rayer said.

Matthew Herbert shared photos on Twitter on Saturday (13 May) announcing the birth of his son Finn, saying, “he is just perfect”, and that “everyone is super happy and healthy”.  “Finn arrived literally into my hands with just four pushes at 3:03am on the 13 of May following 18 hours (!!!) of labour contractions,” he wrote.  “Finn has filled a hole in our hearts we didn’t even know existed”  Despite Herbert’s beautiful post celebrating the birth of his child, his post was viciously attacked by trolls, mostly due to his choice to have Finn through a surrogate, something which many people – straight, LGBTQ+, single, married – choose to do, including celebrities like Kim Kardashian.  “Oof. I had no idea surrogacy and adoption were so controversial before reading this … people need to mind their own,” a supportive commenter posted on Twitter.  But many social media users with paid-for blue ticks attacked his post and his new role as a father.  “This baby needs a mother, not you”, “Who suffered the labour contractions?”, “Return that poor baby to the mother” and “This is wrong on so many levels” were just some of the comments left under his photos.  Twitter, he is just perfect.  Finn arrived literally into my hands with just 4 pushes at 3:03am on the 13th of May following 18 hours (!!!) of labour contractions.  Everyone is super happy and healthy.    Finn has filled a hole in our hearts we didn’t even know existed 🥰🥰 pic.twitter.com/YOCCyJU229 — Matthew Herbert (@m_herbert) May 13, 2023  Hitting back at trolls, Herbert explained: “Reading the replies and unsolicited DMs has reminded me how much hate there is in this world, and how there are people who don’t want us and baby Finn to succeed in this world.  “Fear not, it’s all water off a duck’s back for us … but it won’t always be for Finn as he grows.  “Finn is surrounded by more love than could ever be measured.”  He added that he will be protecting the privacy of his baby’s birth mother, who will be a “huge part of our lives forever” and “chose us just as much as we chose her”.  Herbert pointed out to trolls who had attacked him choosing surrogacy, implying he had “purchased” his baby, that “commercial” surrogacy is illegal in New Zealand, therefore surrogates choose to carry the baby for altruistic reasons rather than being paid to do so.  Reading the replies and unsolicited DMs has reminded me how much hate there is in this world, and how there are people who don’t want us and baby Finn to succeed in this world.    Fear not, it’s all water off a ducks back for us.  But it won’t always be for Finn as he grows. 1/ pic.twitter.com/fRimsBNeg9 — Matthew Herbert (@m_herbert) May 15, 2023  In the UK, recommendations have been made for “major changes” to surrogacy law to make things easier for intended parents.  In a review commissioned by the government, the Law Commission of England and Wales and the Scottish Law Commission proposed a new pathway to legal parenthood that would mean intended parents have parental rights from birth.  Currently, intended parents must wait to obtain a court order in order to gain parental rights, which should take six weeks, but in reality can be much longer.  Under the proposals, intended parents would have those rights from birth – though the surrogate would be able to withdraw their consent and assert parental rights until six weeks after birth.  Father and surrogacy advocate Michael Johnson-Ellis “welcomed” the reforms, describing them as a “big win”.  “What it is doing is certainly providing equitable access to parenthood from birth, and that was something that obviously never existed previously,” Johnson-Ellis told PinkNews in March.  “The full report definitely shows more balance with between LGBTQ+ and heterosexual intended parents.”  Just as in New Zealand, paid-for surrogacy is illegal in the UK.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXBpbmtuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE2L2dheS1mYXRoZXItc3Vycm9nYXRlLXR3aXR0ZXItdHJvbGxpbmctbmV3LXplYWxhbmQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Mikaela and Matt Bennett were pregnant with twins. Mikalea was born with a rare disease that she did not know about, as symptoms did not show until she was pregnant. When she began to get nose bleeds and her legs swelled, they went to the hospital.  On Dec. 21, 2022, she was admitted to the hospital at 24 weeks pregnant with a rare condition known as HHT with AVMs. HHT causes some blood vessels to not develop properly, including the possibility of some not forming with capillaries. AVM stands for arteriovenous malformation, where an abnormal connection is formed between the arteries and the veins. This is usually present in the brain and the spine and present at birth. If AVMs rupture it can cause bleeding in the brain and spinal cords.  “In December the hospital detected it in her own body,” Matt Bennett’s aunt Karin McAdoo said. “It went undetected until she was pregnant with the twins. They also detected an embolism in her lungs which was bleeding, and a lot of other complications.”  After seeing many different types of specialists and baby doctors, McAdoo said Mikaela had an emergency C-Section at 30 weeks pregnant. She gave birth to a boy and a girl — Madalynn and Myles on Feb. 1. McAdoo said Mikaela was not able to see or hold them and they had to be immediately transferred to a different hospital, as they both had AVMs detected as well. The baby girl passed away four days later, but Myles Bennett is still here. McAdoo said Madalynn passed away at a different hospital than the one Mikaela was at, and that Mikaela never got to hold her daughter while she was alive.  “During the C-Section Mikaela coded, but was brought back,” McAdoo said. “Myles has AVMs on his brain. He may end up needing a liver transplant, which is scary for a baby. That’s not something they can do until he is six months old. He is only three months old now.”  The Bennetts have come home since the birth, but have had to travel back and forth to the hospital in Pittsburgh for appointments. McAdoo said at least three different hospitals have been involved in this situation. Matt Bennett did not work from Dec. 21 when they went to the hospital to April 12 when they were released. He had to ask his job to be able to come back, and the only income during that time was donations from people.  The spaghetti dinner — put on by the organization Brother’s By Choice — will be held on Sunday, May 21 from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. at the Celoron Legion, Herman Kent Post 777, 23 Jackson Ave., Jamestown. The price for the dinner is $10, and children five and under are free. Besides the dinner there will be a DJ, bake sale, and basket giveaway.  “We’ve had some amazing donations,” McAdoo said. “We’ve had a queen mattress set donated from Jamestown Mattress. There’s the bake sale, and a lot of other donations, including a grill. There’s a lot of nice stuff.”  Gift certificates and baskets will also be available.  A Go Fund Me for the Bennett family can be found at https://www.gofundme.com/f/cxb357-the-bennett-family.  McAdoo said while there is a long road ahead, the family has been staying strong during this hard time.  “They are an amazing family,” McAdoo said. “They are strong. Their faith has kept them going.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvc3Qtam91cm5hbC5jb20vbmV3cy90b3Atc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLzA1L3NwYWdoZXR0aS1kaW5uZXItYmVuZWZpdC10by1iZS1oZWxkLWZvci1sb2NhbC1mYW1pbHkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"birth","2023-05-16","14:00:00","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 15:06:06","Fundal height is a measurement taken during pregnancy to monitor fetal growth. Fundal height measures the distance between the top of the uterus and the pelvic bone in a pregnant person. It determines if your baby is growing as expected and confirms gestational age (how far along you are in pregnancy). It can also assess where the baby is in the uterus.    This article discusses fundal height, including what it is, when it's used, and what the measurements mean during pregnancy.  BSIP / Getty Images  Fundal Height Defined  Fundal height is a simple screening tool your healthcare provider uses to monitor your baby’s growth and development. It is measured in centimeters and is often first taken at prenatal appointments starting at 20 weeks of pregnancy. The fundal height measurement in centimeters should be close to the fetus’s gestational age in weeks. For example, if you are 27 weeks pregnant, your fundal height should be about 27 centimeters (give or take 2 centimeters).  A fundal height that is too small or too large could indicate a pregnancy complication. If your fundal height is out of the norm, your healthcare provider will recommend an ultrasound. People with high-risk pregnancies often require more ultrasounds as well.  Fundal height is an imprecise measurement, and some factors can affect it. For instance, fundal height may be more challenging to measure in pregnant people who have a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher. Having a history of uterine fibroids may also affect the accuracy of fundal height.  What Is Average Fundal Height? Average fundal height in centimeters usually is the same numeral as the fetus's gestational age in weeks. For example, if you are 32 weeks pregnant, your fundal height will likely be 32 centimeters.    How Fundal Height Measurements Work  Fundal height can be measured quickly and easily. Your healthcare provider will ask you to lie down face up on the exam table, similar to when you have an ultrasound or pelvic exam.  Your provider will then run a soft tape measure from the area of your belly where the top of your uterus would be down to your pubic bone.  After 20 weeks of pregnancy, your fundal height will likely be measured at each appointment. Before 20 weeks, an ultrasound exam estimates your baby’s gestational age. If your fundal height measurement is higher or lower than expected, your provider will likely remeasure you and then refer you for an ultrasound.    What Are Fundal Height Measurements Used For?  Measuring fundal height is used to monitor fetal growth and development. Several factors can affect how a fetus develops during pregnancy. Fundal height is a simple way to detect potential growth issues or complications.  If your fundal height is low, your baby may not be growing as expected. If your fundal height is high, your baby may grow faster than expected. When your fundal height measurement is below or above average, your healthcare provider will recommend an ultrasound to confirm the finding and determine the cause.  Genetics, nutrition, infection, environmental exposures, and the pregnant person’s overall health influence fetal size and growth.  Small for Gestational Age  ""Small for gestational age"" is a term that refers to a fetus that is smaller or less developed than usual. This is also referred to as intrauterine growth restriction. Babies with a birth weight below the 10th percentile are considered small for gestational age.  If your fundal height is smaller than expected, your baby may be small for gestational age. It is also possible that you are not as far along in pregnancy as previously estimated.  Possible causes of being small for gestational age include:  Genetic conditions  Metabolic diseases (medical conditions caused by a genetic defect)  Chromosome anomalies (a change in a baby's DNA that alters development before birth)  Multiple pregnancy (twins, triplets, etc.)  Infants who are small for gestational age are at higher risk of experiencing:  High red blood cell count  Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)  Low body temperature  Meconium aspiration (when a newborn breathes meconium or stool and amniotic fluid into the lungs)  (when a newborn breathes meconium or stool and amniotic fluid into the lungs) Neurological injury    Large for Gestational Age  ""Large for gestational age"" is a term referring to a fetus larger or more developed than average. Babies with a birth weight above the 90th percentile are considered large for gestational age.  If your fundal height exceeds the average, your baby may be large for gestational age. You may also be further along in pregnancy than previously estimated.  Possible causes of large gestational age include:  Gestational diabetes  Maternal obesity  Excessive pregnancy weight gain  Babies who are born large for gestational age are at a higher risk of experiencing:  An injury during childbirth  Shoulder dystocia (when a baby's shoulders get stuck during delivery)  Low blood sugar after delivery  Neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission  Risks and Warnings  A fundal height measurement is a noninvasive tool. There is no risk associated with this exam. It is important to note that fundal height is not always accurate and may vary depending on the healthcare provider’s technique, the pregnant person’s weight gain, and other factors.  For this reason, it is important to verify any abnormal findings with an ultrasound immediately. Research estimates that 75% to 90% of fetal growth abnormalities go undiagnosed until birth.  Summary  Fundal height is a measurement taken during pregnancy to monitor fetal growth. Fundal height measures the distance between the pelvic bone and the top of the uterus in a pregnant person. It determines if your baby is growing as expected.  Fundal height is measured in centimeters and is usually started around 20 weeks of pregnancy. It may be used to assess your baby for small or gestational age (SGA) or large for gestational age (LGA). If your measurement is abnormal, your provider will recommend an ultrasound exam.

A BBC Newsnight investigation has found scammers are using Facebook to find willing participants and claim to have “helped” thousands of women with the move, which helps the child to get UK citizenship and the mother a residency route.  Facebook told the BBC such content was banned by its rules.  A BBC researcher went undercover, posing as a pregnant woman who was in the UK illegally, and spoke to people offering the services.  One agent, who went by the name Thai, told her he had a number of British men who could act as fake fathers and offered a “full package” for £11,000.  He introduced the undercover researcher to a British man called Andrew, who he said would pose as a father and would be paid £8,000 from the total fee, the BBC reports.  A child is automatically British by birth if a migrant woman is in the UK illegally but gives birth to a child fathered by a British citizen or a man with indefinite leave to remain.  The mother can then apply for a family visa, which will give her the right to remain in the UK and apply for citizenship in due course.  Last year, 4,860 family visas were granted to “other dependants”, a category that includes those applying to stay in the UK as parents of British children.  Deliberately giving false details on a birth certificate is a criminal offence.  The Home Office told the BBC it had measures in place to prevent and detect immigration fraud using false birth certificates.  The BBC was told that the practice occurred in many different migrant communities including those from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nigeria and Sri Lanka, and had been happening for many years.  The investigation found that the illegal practice was advertised widely on some Vietnamese Facebook groups for jobseekers.  Meta, the company that owns Facebook, told the BBC it did not allow “the solicitation of adoptions or birth certificate fraud on Facebook”.

"birth","2022-12-05","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 11:49:47","THE NUMBER of registered births and deaths in 2022 declined by 8.2% and 29.2% year on year, respectively, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) reported on Tuesday.  Citing preliminary data from its Vital Statistics Report, the PSA said births last year totaled 1.25 million, declining by 8.2% from 1.36 million tallied in 2021.  The Calabarzon (Cavite-Laguna-Batangas-Rizal-Quezon) Region had the highest registration of birth, accounting for 15.6% or 195,795 of all births nationwide.  This was followed by Central Luzon with a 12% share (149,939) and capital region Metro Manila’s 10.1% (126,471).  However, Calabarzon’s birth tally last year was lower by 4.2% annually compared with 204,333 in 2021. Registered births in the National Capital Region (NCR) also contracted by 21.4%.  Preliminary vital statistics data from the PSA showed deaths from January to December reached 622,509, falling by 29.2% from 879,429 in 2021.  Calabarzon also accounted for the highest registered deaths with 15.1% of the total deaths last year at 94,084. This was lower by 32% from 138,298 recorded in 2021.  It was followed by Central Luzon with a 12.1% share at 75,397, and NCR with 11.4% at 70,801.  Meanwhile, registered marriages climbed by 12.5% year on year to 401,388 last year from 356,839 in 2021.  Calabarzon had the highest share of registered marriages at 15.2% with 60,831, followed by Central Luzon, 11.8% share or 47,273 and NCR’s 11.8% or 47,245.  The information in the vital statistics report was compiled from tallies generated by city or municipal Civil Registrars during the period, consolidated by the PSA’s Provincial Statistical Offices and then submitted to the Office of the Civil Registrar General as of Feb. 28.  CAUSES OF DEATH  In a separate report, the PSA said that ischemic heart diseases were the leading cause of deaths in the country with 114,557 cases in 2022. This is equivalent to 18.4% of the 622,509 total deaths listed in the January to December period.  Neoplasms diseases were the second-highest cause of death with 63,377 (10.2% share), followed by cerebrovascular diseases with 63,281 (10.2% share).  Meanwhile, deaths due to COVID-19 totaled 17,011 in 2022, declining by 84.9% from the 112,772 deaths registered in 2021.  Deaths associated with COVID-19 are classified into those with the virus identified and not identified at the time of death.  COVID-19 with virus identified accounted for 12,085 or 1.9% of total deaths. Taken by itself, this category would be the 11th leading cause of death during the period.  Some 4,926 deaths due to COVID-19 fell into the “virus not identified” category, accounting for 0.8% of total deaths, or 23rd overall.  According to the PSA, data on COVID-19 deaths were based on death certificates received and certified by health officers of local government units. — Lourdes O.

I’m Kaitlyn, and I’m one of the new members of the Gorilla Care Team. While I’m one of the newest humans on the team, I am not the newest addition in the gorilla building. I’m so excited to be sharing about the newest member of our gorilla family, Willie B. III, and how his family is responding to his arrival.  We welcomed the first baby of parents Shalia and Willie B., Jr., on April 24, and I can certainly say there is no better way to begin a new job. The Gorilla Care Team was pleasantly surprised by his arrival, as we were expecting him to make his debut in May. Shalia made childbirth look like a walk in the park! She was not only calm, cool, and collected all morning preceding his birth, but also remained that way throughout the day and gave birth with no complications, surrounded by her troop. As a new mom myself, I was in awe at her resilience and natural ability. Gorillas really are some of the most amazing animals.  Shalia isn’t new at motherhood, as this is her second baby, but for the rest of her troop, these are uncharted waters. New father Willie B., Jr. has remained cautiously interested in the small bundle that never leaves Shalia’s arms – something many new fathers can relate to. At first, the new dad was hesitant to be in the same space as the infant and would observe only at a distance. Recently, however, we have noticed him observing from much closer and even appearing to lean in and gaze directly at the baby. This of course has caused many happy tears and squeaks of joy from the humans on the team. It’s momentous to experience Willie B., Jr.’s journey into fatherhood, not only because he’s a favorite of most of his care team, but also because of the legacy the birth of his son continues.  You may be wondering how “aunties” Kambera and Amari are reacting. This birth is important for many reasons, but one of them is the opportunity for the other girls to experience infant rearing. Motherhood is hard enough without having to learn on the job, so for gorilla troops, it’s important for females to be able to gain experience from watching their mothers and troop members raise babies. We are hoping that Kambera especially shows interest in Willie B., III, so she can learn from supermom Shalia and will be ready to care for her own infant when the time comes. Amari was immediately interested in the baby and began following Shalia around on day one. She can often be found peering over Shalia’s shoulder and watching as the baby sleeps or nurses. Mom is very tolerant of Amari’s interest, but will gently redirect her if Amari comes too close. Kambera didn’t show much interest to begin with, but she has recently began sitting closer to Shalia and sneaking peeks at the baby when she thinks no one is watching her. She can pretend not to think Willie B., III is the cutest thing she’s ever seen, but we all know you love him too, Kambera!  Keep an eye out for more updates on our newest family group as we continue to watch them all adjust to this new life. Stop by Gorilla Habitat 4 on your next visit and you’ll be sure to spot proud mom Shalia cradling her bundle of joy.  Kaitlyn K.

"birth","2023-05-16","Not Discerned","{""Florence"", ""Toscana"", ""Italy""}","Tue 16 May 2023 07:12:10","REICHARD, HOST: Today is Tuesday, May 16th. Thank you for turning to WORLD Radio to help start your day. Good morning. I’m Mary Reichard.  NICK EICHER, HOST: And I’m Nick Eicher. Coming next on The World and Everything in It: adoption law and ethics.  Today, we launched Episode 5 of Effective Compassion. It tells the story of adoption from a legal perspective, circumstances where a child is removed from a home because of abuse or neglect and permanently placed with another family. That’s when a judge gets involved to help decide what’s best for the child.  REICHARD: But what about adoption by choice? When birth parents voluntarily place a child for adoption? The courts don’t typically get involved in those situations. But lawyers do. Today, WORLD reporter Jenny Rough talks with an adoption attorney who has dedicated her life to walking families through the process.  JENNY ROUGH, REPORTER: In 1883, a Christian businessman from New York opened the first Florence Crittenton home. He wanted to provide shelter for unwed pregnant women, and share the gospel with them. In the decades that followed, Crittenton homes spread to major cities across the country.  BARBARA JONES: You know, back in those days, they would whisk the girls away from school or wherever. It was kind of shameful if she was pregnant before she was married.    Barbara Jones lives in Clifton, Virginia. Her home is located on a former Crittenton farm. The pregnant women lived in a dormer home on the back of the property.  JONES: And they planted in the garden, and they actually worked on the farm. And then, after the babies were born, they went back to their life.    The babies were adopted. It’s fitting that Jones lives there now. She works as an adoption attorney.  JONES: It is a boutique specialty. I gravitated into it very quickly after I obtained my law license and just fell in love with it because it’s family oriented.    In the greeting area of her office, every wall is covered with photos.  ROUGH: Are these all the babies?    JONES: No, they’re some of them. The reason is now people do digital pictures.  Depending on the case, Jones works with birth parents and adoptive parents.  JONES: Representing a birth parent is painful, because there’s sorrow in separating from her baby, probably the hardest thing she’ll ever do. Representing adoptive parents, high anxiety, but great joy when they’re placed.    A stack of old newspapers sits on her conference table. Thirty-five years ago, when Jones first started practicing adoption law, matches were made through the classifieds 1-800 numbers.  JONES: Here’s a classified ad. Virginian-Pilot. Come to adoption. Sam and Sue wish to adopt healthy newborn child. Will pay legal, uninsured medical.    Now, those who hope to adopt advertise online. Either directly through word-of-mouth networking, or through an agency.  Adoption lawyers like Jones advise birth mothers of the law and help them think through what they want.  JONES: She can complete a hospital plan. A nursery consent, stating who could come into the nursery and hold and feed her baby. Who she wants in the delivery room. Does she want pictures?    She also helps birth moms fill out forms for medical history, family history, social history. Authorization releases and oaths that affirm the information is true.  One of Jones’ most important duties: helping the birth mom obtain the consent of the birth father. This can be harder than it sounds.  JONES: “I was drunk at a party,” we hear way too much. Sometimes there are girls prostituting or sex trafficking.    Jones has encountered many cases where the birth father is unknown.  JONES: And if a mother says, “I don’t know who he was. He said his name was Dave or Tripp,” You know how many Daves there are in Virginia?    State laws vary. But today, over 35 states, including Virginia, have a system in place to help track down fathers.  JONES: We implemented the birth father registry so we didn’t have to chase men in dark alleys at night, and we could say, “Hey, we’re representing Susie Smith. Step up now.” We want to protect fathers if they want to parent, but they need to step up in the window of time.    Adoptive parents also have a lot of paperwork. Most notably, a home study. An intensive process that involves everything from a criminal records check to biographical history.  So that’s the law of adoption. But what about ethics? Adoption scams are becoming more common. Historically, it was considered ethical for hopeful adoptive parents to cover some expenses for the birth mom—medical and pregnancy-related expenses, like maternity clothes. But in some states, it’s now the norm for adoptive parents to cover living expenses for the birth mom. Thousands of dollars a month.  JONES: Often I'll get a call from some of the states in the west and they'll say, well, what is your birth mom's budget? If she comes in here and it’s all about money.    Jones’ antenna goes up! The practice can be coercive on both ends. The pregnant woman might feel coerced to give up her child, even if she wants to legitimately change her mind, if the adoptive parents have been sending money. And adoptive parents may feel coerced to keep paying lest the birth mom go off and find someone else. Some states have implemented laws to guard against that.  JONES: Virginia is very restrictive. You can pay living expenses for the birth mom, but only if her doctor writes a note and says she cannot work due to medical complications or reasons of the pregnancy.    Finally, Jones draws up post-adoption contracts. An agreement between the parties to stay in touch through letters, pictures, and visits.  JONES: Oftentimes the birth parents like that. They know they picked a good family, they like them, but they’re just so afraid they’ll separate and that family will forget them. We will type it up, and we put the terms that the parties have agreed. They might do two visits a year. Birth parents may send gifts. The adoptive parents will send videos and pictures, whatever they agree upon.    Birth mothers do have time to change their minds. How long again, varies by state. Maryland is one the longest at 30 days.  JONES: And then in Virginia she has 7 days to revoke.  ROUGH: Okay.  JONES: No matter what. It’s a very small percentage that change their mind after the mom goes home and the baby goes out the door with the agency or the family.    When the time period to revoke passes, the child is adopted, welcomed into a new family, with the family’s full name, identity, and rights.  To this day, Jones tries to carry on the history of her property as a safe haven.  JONES: There’s peace in this place, and I know there was much prayer that went on here. And sometimes my clients will come in and say, “This place is so peaceful.” And I just feel like the Lord was here ahead of time.  Reporting for WORLD, I’m Jenny Rough in Clifton, Virginia.

What You Need To Know Clearwater residents Kaitlyn and Tim McCallum began to notice a shell-like growth on back of their newborn son, James    A pediatric dermatologist in Orlando diagnosed James with giant congenital melanocytic nevus    Doctors have completed the removal process and now they’ve started a series of procedures to replace the bad skin with good skin      View photos of James' journey below  Kaitlyn delivered James in August, 2021. When he came out, there was a scabby growth on his back.  “(It was) terrifying, to say the least,” Kaitlyn said. “Right when he was born, it was pretty flat. There was a bump by his neck, there was a lump.”  “That’s kind of concerning, when you have medical professionals and they’re telling you they’ve never seen this before,” said Tim, who said doctors were initially puzzled.  As the McCallum parents searched for answers, struggling with the uncertainty, the growth increased in size, becoming lumpier and fattier. The spots grew darker, the texture became fleshier and the exterior grew hairier.  The growth began to resemble a turtle shell, with Kaitlyn and Tim adopting the nickname of “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle” for their toddler.  “We try to give him any superhero nickname, because that’s what he is to us,” Kaitlyn said.  Unfortunately, the shell-like growth also began to hinder James’ life. He couldn’t sleep on his back, which is a safe sleep practice for babies, and his head and neck movement became more and more restricted.  Finally, a pediatric dermatologist in Orlando offered a diagnosis: A giant congenital melanocytic nevus.  It’s a large patch of skin, often described as a mole or a birthmark, which presents at birth or develops in a baby’s first year. It is usually not harmful, though it can develop into cancer or become dangerous if it reaches the brain or spine. Thankfully, in James’ case, it was cumbersome, but harmless.  “Getting that diagnosis of ‘Okay, here is what It is, here’s who you can go to, here’s how we’re going to fix it,’ that was the moment of, ‘Okay, we can do this,’” Kaitlyn said.  Doctors began the removal process when James was six months old, starting with the lump by his neck and then moving down his back to remove the bulk of the shell. Now, they’ve started a series of procedures to remove the bad skin and replace it with good skin. A specialist at the University of Chicago is spearheading that work.  When it’s all over, doctors hope James will be left with nothing more than a scar. His parents know their turtle-shell hero will have a story to tell and they’ll look back on the strength it took for all of them to endure this birth surprise.  “I’ve learned how strong you can be and how much a mother can do for a kid,” Kaitlyn said. “Just keep staying strong. There’s an end to this and we’re almost there.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vc3BlY3RydW1sb2NhbG5ld3MuY29tL3R4L2F1c3Rpbi9uZXdzLzIwMjMvMDUvMTYvLW5pbmphLXR1cnRsZS1iYWJ5LS1vdmVyY29taW5nLXNoZWxsLWxpa2UtZ3Jvd3RoLW9uLWJhY2vSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Thurza Blagg, from Nottingham, was rushed to hospital when she began bleeding whilst on holiday on the Greek island.  The 32-year-old, who is 28 weeks pregnant, is desperate to return home where she feels she can give birth safely. However, Ms Blagg says her insurance company AXA missed a chance to repatriate her, resulting instead in an urgent transfer to Alexandra hospital in Athens.  She said due to the language barrier and receiving little support, she does not understand what is happening with her baby. ""I don't feel very safe, I don't feel like I've got a clear birth plan,"" she said.  The UK government said it was supporting Ms Blagg and is in contact with local authorities. AXA has stated it was crucial to ensure any decision made was the right one and, after carefully reviewing her case, it is providing her with the medical assistance she needs.  On May 6, Ms Blagg went to Rhodes with her mum Kim, who was celebrating her 60th birthday.  Ms Blagg said it was an attempt to ""get away from it all"" after her partner - and dad to her unborn baby - Paul Ahad took his own life in January. ""This baby that I'm carrying now is really important because it's the only piece of my partner I've got left,"" she said.  She received a fit-to-fly letter ahead of her trip, but on May 12, just two days before she was due to return, she began bleeding. After being rushed to Rhodes General Hospital, Ms Blagg was told her waters had broke. She was given medication to delay the birth and contacted AXA so she could arrange a flight home.  Due to it being the weekend the insurance company were unable to acquire the necessary information from her GP. Instead, in a letter seen by Nottinghamshire Live, it said Ms Blagg could sign a medical disclaimer saying she would be liable for payment if she did not ""fall within the terms of your policy"".  However, after sending the signed documentation, Ms Blagg said AXA failed to organise her flight before the decision was made to move her to Athens. ""I should've been sent home but they basically ignored that,"" she said.  ""They left me in a hospital for 12 hours without neonatal facilities. Time was running out and a decision had to be made.  ""There was an opportunity for me to return home to receive the appropriate care. I did everything they asked, it isn't about money, I want my baby to be alive, healthy and safe. I'm scared and I want to go home and understand what's happening to my baby.  ""It's not like the UK here, it's hard to understand what my condition is. There is a massive language barrier, when they're saying medical terms and I'm carrying my first full term pregnancy, it's hard to understand what's going on.  ""I don't feel very safe, I don't feel like I've got a clear birth plan. They're changing my sheets today for the first time, I haven't been offered any food or water, my mum has to buy it all.""  She added that she was assessed in plain view of other patients and their visitors. ""People's boyfriends could be there and staff will rip off my pants to have a look at me, there's no curtain or privacy. I feel highly vulnerable.""  Ms Blagg is still in contact with AXA and the British Embassy, who she hopes will help her return to the UK. ""It's mine and Paul's baby, it's all I've got left of Paul,"" she said. ""I feel pressurised and I don't feel safe.""  Her mum, Kim, who has remained by her side throughout, said: ""It's been disgusting, shocking and frightening. It's been an awful ordeal and because of there being limited visiting hours I've had to fight to stay in the room with her. We've had no support whatsoever, the insurance company has been terrible.""  A spokesperson for the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said: “We are supporting a British woman hospitalised in Greece and are in contact with the local authorities.”  An AXA Partners spokesperson said:“We are very sorry to hear about Ms Blagg’s circumstances and we sympathise with her situation. Due to the complex nature of her condition, we have a duty of care to ensure any decision we take is in her best interest.  ""Therefore, it was essential for our medical team to obtain and review Ms Blagg’s full medical history in order to determine the appropriate next steps to ensure she receives the right level of care. Following a review of this information, we will provide her with the medical assistance she requires.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vZ3JlZWtjaXR5dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTcvcHJlZ25hbnQtYnJpdGlzaC13b21hbi1zdHVjay1pbi1yaG9kZXMtaG9zcGl0YWwtYW5kLWZlYXJpbmctZm9yLWJhYnkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Christina Ricci and her husband Mark Hampton tend to keep their family life pretty private, but occasionally share rare glimpses into their roles as parents.  The Casper actress shares son Freddie with ex-husband James Heerdegen. The then-couple welcomed son Freddie in 2014, nearly a year after tying the knot. Ricci filed for divorce from the dolly grip in July 2020; in January 2021, Us Weekly confirmed that a judge ordered Heerdegen to stay 100 yards away from the actress after she accused him of domestic violence. Heerdegen was also stripped of his visitation rights with their son.  Following the duo’s split, Ricci moved on with Hampton in July 2021. In August 2021, the twosome shared that they were expecting a little one together. After tying the knot two months after announcing the exciting news, the pair welcomed daughter Cleopatra in December 2021.  “My heart has exploded,” the hairdresser said alongside a photo of the newborn. “@riccigrams and baby Cleo are doing fantastic. We’re all resting after such an eventful morning.. Welcome to the world baby Cleopatra Ricci Hampton.”  A month after Cleo’s birth, Ricci revealed that Hampton had actually chosen their daughter’s full name.  “We were gonna call her Cleo and then right before they were preparing me for the C-section, they started talking about how we had to fill out birth certificate stuff, [and] my husband was like, ‘We’ve got to give her a full name, right? And then the nickname is Cleo,’” Ricci recalled during a January 2022 appearance on the Ellen DeGeneres Show. “I was sort of like, ‘Whatever, we can talk about this later.’ Then he got so excited that he put it on Instagram.”  In a November 2022 interview with The Sunday Times, the Wednesday actress opened up about how giving birth to her first-born changed her in a lot of ways.  “My son’s birth really broke my nihilism and it was a pretty surprising change,” Ricci explained to the outlet. “I thought I would really love him and feel a lot of emotions towards him.

In 2014, after the birth of my first child, I fell into a deep and dark hole. Food tasted like cardboard. My body buzzed with anxiety. I would beg my husband not to leave me alone with our colicky baby girl. I felt like I’d made a terrible mistake. I wasn’t cut out to be a mother.  What I didn’t realize was that this wasn’t motherhood: this was postpartum anxiety and OCD, and I was paralyzed by my symptoms. One night my husband persuaded me to attend a local support group for moms. I was skeptical. How could these moms help? But I got there and I saw, well, just a bunch of moms. They looked normal. They weren’t “crazy,” and some of them were even getting better. And it wasn’t like a light switch turned on, but slowly I found some hope, felt less alone, and got on medication because these other mothers normalized taking medication as a tool for recovery. I am positive that the group saved my life.  Once I recovered, I became a volunteer for Moms Supporting Moms (MSM), a local organization, then the program coordinator for MSM, and now I am the Support Groups Manager for Postpartum Support International, an international non-profit. I’ve focused on supporting pregnant and postpartum parents for the last eight years, and I’d like to share some of the resources that I have learned about along the way.  The Triangle area has a wealth of resources to support moms, birthing people, and new families during one of life’s biggest transitions: having a baby.  mental health challenge is the #1 complication from childbirth and that 15-20% of moms experience anxiety and/or depression during pregnancy and/or postpartum (the perinatal period). While these challenges are common, they are also very difficult. In honor of Maternal Mental Health Awareness Month, I want to highlight the resources we have for expectant and postpartum parents. We know that experiencing aand that(the perinatal period). While these challenges are common, they are also very difficult.  In the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill area, there are so many organizations, businesses, and providers who are ready to help and trained in perinatal mental health. The three main tools for supporting pregnant and postpartum moms who are experiencing anxiety and/or depression are medication, therapy and peer support. All of those tools are available in our area:  The UNC’s Center for Women’s Mood Clinic in Chapel Hill has an inpatient psychiatry unit dedicated to pregnant and postpartum people. North Carolina is home to 1 of 3 units like this in the entire country. At the UNC Women’s Mood Clinic, pregnant and postpartum moms in a mental health crisis can find expert, inpatient care, which is a rarity in our nation. Anchor Perinatal is an outpatient intensive program focused solely on perinatal clients. Moms (or parents) can receive therapy and support group sessions from therapists trained in perinatal mental health and then go home to their families each day. Anchor also has a free, walk-in clinic for screening for perinatal mood challenges. The founding therapists are all extensively trained in perinatal mental health. This is an amazing resource! Moms Supporting Moms (MSM) is the longest running, free peer support group for pregnant and postpartum moms in the Triangle. Moms Supporting Moms meets every Thursday evening (virtually), so that moms can join together and know they are not alone. MSM also provides free, volunteer mentors to new moms. An experienced mom volunteers to guide a new mom through the first-year of her baby’s life. Support groups and mentors help fight against the stigma of perinatal mental health challenges, and the connection MSM provides is a wonderful tool to help moms get on the road to recovery. Equity Before Birth (EBB) serves Black families by providing financial support for pregnancy-related services and needs. EBB pays birth workers and educators to support pregnant black birthing people. We know that this type of support can save lives and can help decrease physical and mental health complications. Triangle Area Parenting Support (TAPS) provides a 10-week session (virtual) with other new parents in each area of the Triangle, so parents connect with those in their city. The sessions focus on information but also support and connection. These groups can help decrease isolation and increase parent confidence with new skills and education. Sessions are in English and Spanish. Family Connects Durham is a free nurse home visiting program for all parents of newborns, regardless of financial need. Registered nurses support all families in Durham County by providing no-cost postpartum home visits. Nurses can help identify a perinatal mood challenge and connect parents with resources to help them cope and decrease feelings of isolation. Emerald Doulas provides birth and postpartum doula care, support groups and classes. Emerald Doulas have support groups for pregnant parents, new moms, LGBTQ+ parents, and moms of color. HER Health Collective is a supportive community for all moms, with in-person and virtual events to help moms connect. HER also provides women’s health information from experts via their events and podcasts. You can check out my interview on their podcast if you want even more information on perinatal support in the Triangle area. Rosenberg Perinatal & Waypoint Counseling are two group practices focused on perinatal mental health in the Triangle. Rosenberg Perinatal is a group of mental health clinicians supporting the emotional wellbeing of pregnant and postpartum parents, individuals experiencing fertility challenges and adoptive parents. Many of their clinicians also speak Spanish! Waypoint Counseling is a team of mental health professionals with a special focus on postpartum anxiety and depression, birth trauma, NICU parenting, and much more. Waypoint can also help with medication management. MAAME (Mobilizing African American Mothers through Empowerment) empowers Black, Indigenous, and other People of Color during pregnancy and postpartum. MAAME can help to navigate systems, offer resources, services, and support. MAAME also has a maternal mental health program for parents of 0-5 year old children. In this program, mothers or birthing people can find a support group, individual peer support, and therapy sessions.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndyYWwuY29tLzEwLXRyaWFuZ2xlLXJlc291cmNlcy10by1zdXBwb3J0LW1vbXMtYW5kLXBhcmVudHMvMjA4NTMzMzAv0gFUaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3JhbC5jb20vYW1wLzEwLXRyaWFuZ2xlLXJlc291cmNlcy10by1zdXBwb3J0LW1vbXMtYW5kLXBhcmVudHMvMjA4NTMzMzAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

What You Need To Know Clearwater residents Kaitlyn and Tim McCallum began to notice a shell-like growth on back of their newborn son, James    A pediatric dermatologist in Orlando diagnosed James with giant congenital melanocytic nevus    Doctors have completed the removal process and now they’ve started a series of procedures to replace the bad skin with good skin      View photos of James' journey below  Kaitlyn delivered James in August, 2021. When he came out, there was a scabby growth on his back.  “(It was) terrifying, to say the least,” Kaitlyn said. “Right when he was born, it was pretty flat. There was a bump by his neck, there was a lump.”  “That’s kind of concerning, when you have medical professionals and they’re telling you they’ve never seen this before,” said Tim, who said doctors were initially puzzled.  As the McCallum parents searched for answers, struggling with the uncertainty, the growth increased in size, becoming lumpier and fattier. The spots grew darker, the texture became fleshier and the exterior grew hairier.  The growth began to resemble a turtle shell, with Kaitlyn and Tim adopting the nickname of “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle” for their toddler.  “We try to give him any superhero nickname, because that’s what he is to us,” Kaitlyn said.  Unfortunately, the shell-like growth also began to hinder James’ life. He couldn’t sleep on his back, which is a safe sleep practice for babies, and his head and neck movement became more and more restricted.  Finally, a pediatric dermatologist in Orlando offered a diagnosis: A giant congenital melanocytic nevus.  It’s a large patch of skin, often described as a mole or a birthmark, which presents at birth or develops in a baby’s first year. It is usually not harmful, though it can develop into cancer or become dangerous if it reaches the brain or spine. Thankfully, in James’ case, it was cumbersome, but harmless.  “Getting that diagnosis of ‘Okay, here is what It is, here’s who you can go to, here’s how we’re going to fix it,’ that was the moment of, ‘Okay, we can do this,’” Kaitlyn said.  Doctors began the removal process when James was six months old, starting with the lump by his neck and then moving down his back to remove the bulk of the shell. Now, they’ve started a series of procedures to remove the bad skin and replace it with good skin. A specialist at the University of Chicago is spearheading that work.  When it’s all over, doctors hope James will be left with nothing more than a scar. His parents know their turtle-shell hero will have a story to tell and they’ll look back on the strength it took for all of them to endure this birth surprise.  “I’ve learned how strong you can be and how much a mother can do for a kid,” Kaitlyn said. “Just keep staying strong. There’s an end to this and we’re almost there.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJheW5ld3M5LmNvbS9mbC90YW1wYS9uZXdzLzIwMjMvMDUvMTYvLW5pbmphLXR1cnRsZS1iYWJ5LS1vdmVyY29taW5nLXNoZWxsLWxpa2UtZ3Jvd3RoLW9uLWJhY2vSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

It will increase the risk of bullying, discrimination, or violence, and impact the right to privacy. This bill should not pass.”  Background  The National Assembly of the Slovak Republic is due to vote on Bill No. 301/1995, also known as the Birth Number Act which, if adopted, would force transgender people to prove they have the ‘correct’ set of chromosomes to have their legal gender affirmed. The act regulates birth numbers, the personal 10 digit identifier given to everyone in Slovakia on the day they are born. It includes information about the date of birth, and numbers for two genders – women are given the number 5, and men the numeral 0. The birth number must be changed to have your gender legally affirmed, but the law would effectively make this impossible, as most transgender people don’t have chromosomes matching their gender identity.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbW5lc3R5Lm9yZy9lbi9sYXRlc3QvbmV3cy8yMDIzLzA1L3Nsb3Zha2lhLXNsb3Zhay1wYXJsaWFtZW50LXNob3VsZC1yZWplY3QtYmlsbC1tYWtpbmctbGVnYWwtZ2VuZGVyLXJlY29nbml0aW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Share this page on Facebook Share this page on Twitter Share this page on LinkedIn Email this page to a friend Print this page  When John Somers arrived to compete at the PGA Professional Championship in late April, he had more than golf on his mind. In fact, just days before, Somers did not know if he would even be able to play.  Somers, who played at Elon from 2009 to 2014, became a father for the first time two days before flying to New Mexico to play in the tournament. John and wife Catherine, another Elon alumna, welcomed daughter Colbie on April 25, just five days before the event was scheduled to begin.  The due date for Colbie’s birth was May 17 but Somers said the early birth was a “blessing in disguise” as it meant he would no longer have to worry about missing her birth while competing at a tournament. After spending some time in the neonatal intensive care unit, Colbie was able to come home with no health issues, which gave Somers the peace of mind he needed to compete at the PGA Professional Championship.  “I wasn’t even expecting to play,” Somers said. “It had always been on my mind, am I going to miss the birth of my baby? It worked out where the baby came and I got to be there with my wife and then welcome my little girl knowing that my wife and the baby are healthy and she’s got a huge family support system, which made me very comfortable and know that I can go out there and play golf and not have to worry about anything.”  Somers works as the head PGA professional at the Southern Hills Plantation Club in Brooksville, Fla. Among his duties include golf shop and staff oversight and running tournaments hosted by the club.  The PGA Professional Championship is a tournament for golf club professionals and teachers who are members of the Professional Golfers’ Association of America. This year, over 300 players competed, with the top 20 finishers earning spots at the PGA Championship, one of the four major tournaments in men’s golf.  During one of his practice rounds in the leadup to the tournament, Somers wrote Colbie’s name on a golf ball to honor his first daughter. However, he quickly had to alter his tribute upon teeing off.  “I lost it on that same hole and I felt so guilty and so bad about it,” Somers said. “I was like, maybe a golf ball’s not a thing to do. So, I started writing it on my glove right below my thumb so that way I can always see it. It’s just a really great tribute for her and hopefully, I can make her proud.”  After shooting a 68 in both the second and third rounds, Somers shared the 54-hole lead. Although he did not win the tournament after a final-round 73, Somers easily secured a spot in this week’s PGA Championship by tying for fourth.  Somers said he did not have a chance to reflect on qualifying for the PGA Championship following the round due to his media obligations and thinking about seeing his family.  “I was just so focused on getting back home and being with my daughter and my wife. It wasn’t really until probably Saturday or Sunday when I started getting all the emails and I’m looking at flights and hotels,” Somers said. “That’s when it kind of hit me like, oh man, I’m actually doing this. I’m playing a major.”  A graduate of Bartlett Yancey High School, located just over 30 minutes from Elon, Somers had a prolific college career with the Phoenix. He was named the team’s most valuable player in both 2013 and 2014 and won the 2014 Coca-Cola Wofford Invitational. He credited his time at Elon for helping him develop as a player.  “College golf is always special because it’s really your last time for a lot of people to experience a team atmosphere,” Somers said. “I made lifelong friends. We played some great golf courses. I had two great coaches with Bill Morningstar and Don Hill. It definitely shaped me into the player I am today.”  Somers has played tournaments on the PGA Latinoamerica and the Korn Ferry Tour, the direct feeder tour for the PGA Tour, but this will be his first appearance at a major championship. The event will be held at Oak Hill Country Club in Rochester, New York, on May 18-21. The course has hosted six major championships, including three PGA Championships, most recently in 2013.  To prepare for the event, Somers said he has spent time watching highlights from the 2013 PGA Championship and other videos overviewing the course. Despite this being his first appearance in a major, Somers said he has high expectations for the week.  “I’d love to win it,” Somers said.”That’s the thing I always tell myself – don’t enter a tournament unless you want to win it.”  Somers will play with Christiaan Bezuidenhout and Chez Reavie, who have combined to win six tournaments on the PGA and DP World Tours, in the first two days. They will tee off in the opening round on Thursday, May 18, at 1:14 p.m. and on Friday, May 19, at 7:49 a.m. The tournament will air on ESPN, ESPN+ and CBS throughout the week.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsb24uZWR1L3UvbmV3cy8yMDIzLzA1LzE2L2pvaG4tc29tZXJzLTE0LXNldC1mb3ItcGdhLWNoYW1waW9uc2hpcC1kZWJ1dC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

It has Kazi Nazrul’s own handwriting.”Das had joined as a trainer at the Gramaphone Co. in 1924. Later, the likes of Bimal Dasgupta and Tulsi Lahiri joined the music company too. “In 1928, K Mullick gained popularity by singing ‘Bagichae bulbuli tui’. When asked about the identity of the songwriter, he mentioned Kazi Nazrul Islam. One day, Mullick chanced upon Nazrul somewhere near Rajabazar and introduced the Gramophone Co. officials to him,” said Das’ son, Arabinda.On persuasion. Nazrul agreed to sign a contract with the Gramaphone Co. According to this contracts, Das’ responsibility was to learn the songs from him and then teach them to others. This process continued for long and soon the duo became great friends. What endeared Nazrul to Das further was the latter’s ability to memorize a song quickly. “He used to address Baba as ‘shrutidhor’. Kazi Jyathamoshai , as we referred him, would say: ‘If Dinu Thakur is Tagore’s ‘kandari’, Dhiren is my ‘gaandhari’ because he can retain my gaan (songs) in his memory. Baba was the first outsider to set Nazrul’s songs to his tunes. The tunes of his songs – ‘Kaalo meyer payer tolae’ and ‘Aar lukabi kothae Maa Kali ’ – that have become popular were composed by my father,” Arabinda said.Not just creative collaborations, Das also came to Nazrul’s aid when the latter had problems finding accommodation. “That was because of his religious identity. Baba got him an accommodation next to our house on Hari Ghosh Street,” Arabinda added.It was very natural for Nazrul to want posterity to know about this friendship. That’s why both decided that Nazrul would write a 14-stanza-long poem on their relationship and Das would set it to tune. But the poem never turned into a song. The untitled poem has Nazrul’s signature.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vbS50aW1lc29maW5kaWEuY29tL2NpdHkva29sa2F0YS9uYXpydWxzLW9kZS10by1mcmllbmQtdG8tYmUtZGlzcGxheWVkLW9uLWJpcnRoLWFubml2L2FydGljbGVzaG93LzEwMDI5MDU2My5jbXPSAXpodHRwczovL20udGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmNvbS9jaXR5L2tvbGthdGEvbmF6cnVscy1vZGUtdG8tZnJpZW5kLXRvLWJlLWRpc3BsYXllZC1vbi1iaXJ0aC1hbm5pdi9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvMTAwMjkwNTYzLmNtcw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Madeline Kaklikos, 24, was diagnosed with a rare condition called uterus didelphys after she and her husband Jon, 27, spent a year trying to have a baby naturally.  Uterus didelphys – where a woman is born with two uteruses – affects just 0.3% of the population. This meant that Kaklikos had both two uteruses and two cervixes.

During this scan, to their astonishment, the doctor told Kakliko and her husband that there was another baby showing, but that this baby was in her other uterus.  Kaklikos gave birth to twins Nate and Cole in February this year. (Caters)  “I thought she must have been joking with us,” Kaklikos recalls. “The second baby was measuring smaller than the first, so it's suspected that we conceived another baby spontaneously the week after our transfer.  “Medics told me that this was a one in 50 million pregnancy because Nate was in one uterus and Cole was in the other, and they had also been conceived in different ways and at different times. Nate was conceived through IVF and Cole was a spontaneous pregnancy.”  Kaklikos says that she and her husband were in such shock after they were told they were having two babies, they both sat in silence for 20 minutes.

"birth","2022-12-27","Not Discerned","{""Holt"", ""Michigan"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 21:25:34","VANCE AIR FORCE BASE, Okla. – Maj. Alayna Holt, 71st Comptroller Squadron commander, was the first at Vance Air Force Base to use the expanded military parental-leave program for Airmen and Guardians.  Following the birth of her daughter in early December 2022, Holt, and her husband, Maj. Zachary Jarvis, 71st Security Forces Squadron commander, were grateful to be a part of a team that fully supported their caregiver leave.  Although Holt and Jarvis became parents before the new policy became effective, Dec. 27, 2022, senior leadership at Vance Air Force Base approved caregiver leave in the spirit of the new policy.  The updated policy authorizes birth parents 12 weeks of caregiver leave following a health-provider recommended period of convalescent leave.  “It’s such a special time to bond with your new child and figure out how to be a first-time parent,” said Holt. “I’m thankful that I took that time.”  Under the previous policy, birth parents received six weeks of caregiver leave following their convalescent leave. But if caregiver leave was not taken immediately after the birth of a child it would be lost.  Non-birth parents received only 21 days of caregiver leave compared to the new policy which authorizes non-birth parents 12 weeks of caregiver leave following the birth of their child.  As a male caregiver, it’s a positive step forward from only 21 days of caregiver leave, said Jarvis.  “The policy is well written in that the leave can be taken in segments of seven days at a time,” said Jarvis. If mission requirements prevent taking the full 12 weeks at once, it can be spread out after the birth of the child.  “Leadership at Vance was supportive of taking ordinary leave in conjunction with my wife’s caregiver leave,” said Jarvis. “We were able to go back home and introduce our daughter to the family. The extra time gave us the opportunity to secure childcare once we returned to work.”  “The bond between a child and a parent is special and those first few months are critical to the formation of a bond that will last a lifetime,” said Col Jay Johnson, 71st Flying Training Wing commander. “I think the new policy is a step in the right direction and will have a positive impact on recruitment and retention.”  “Find what works best for your situation,” said Holt. “If that is not taking all 12 weeks at the same time, that’s okay. But take advantage of the great benefits we have.”  Holt was initially skeptical about being able to take off so much time from work, especially as a squadron commander. But she realized the importance of setting a precedent.  “I reached out to a fellow squadron commander at a different base who had a child a couple of weeks after I did,” said Holt. “She was in the same boat as me, unsure about taking so much time off.”  Both Holt and Jarvis felt it was important to demonstrate the value of what the Air Force was offering parents. “If I’m taking my caregiver leave, I’m showing my folks that it is important,” said Jarvis. “And I expect them to take caregiver leave when that time comes for them.”  Holt and Jarvis are optimistic that their Airmen will see that if their commanders can utilize the new policy, so can they.  “The right thing to do is to take this time to be with your family, because at the end of the day, at the end of the year, at the end of your career, your family is still going to be by your side,” said Holt. “However long you choose to serve, at the end of that time, you want your family there.”  “Major Holt and Major Jarvis are setting a fantastic example for Team Vance Airman to follow,” said Johnson. “They’ve proven that we’ll continue to do what we’ve always done, rally around each other to balance the demands of service to our country and obligations to care for our families.”  “I think the new policy shows we are committed to Airmen,” said Jarvis. “We recruit Airmen but we retain families.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy52YW5jZS5hZi5taWwvTmV3cy9BcnRpY2xlLURpc3BsYXkvQXJ0aWNsZS8zMzk3MzM5L2Fpci1mb3JjZS1wcmlvcml0aXplcy1mYW1pbHktdmFsdWVzLXdpdGgtdmFuY2UtY29tbWFuZGVycy1hcy1sZWFkaW5nLWV4YW1wbGVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The lady realised she was in difficulty and took her back to her home in nearby Dodleston before calling us,” said the animal rescue officer.  “We were able to give Lily the care she needed and she gave birth to four kittens, who are doing well.  “On the basis of her appearance she doesn’t look like she is a stray. I made door-to-door enquiries at properties near to where she was found and I put up a few posters as well.  ""So far no-one has come forward, but maybe someone is worried about the whereabouts of their cat?

She stated that nurses are present in every community, large or small, urban or rural, providing competent care from birth to death, emphasizing that ""nurses' responsibilities span from direct patient care and case management to implementing quality assurance procedures and overseeing complex nursing care systems.""  Ms. Enchill's remarks came during the weekly ""Your Health! Our Collective Responsibility,"" a Ghana News Agency Tema Regional Office initiative aimed at promoting health-related communication and providing a platform for health information dissemination in order to influence personal health choices through improved health literacy.  The Ghana News Agency's Tema Regional Office established the public health advocacy platform ""Your Health! Our Collective Responsibility"" to investigate the elements of four health communication approaches: informing, instructing, persuading, and promoting.  Ms. Enchill stated that as part of commemorating the 2023 International Nurses Day, nurses care for injuries, dispense drugs, conduct frequent medical checks, and record thorough medical histories.  She believes that nurses are the cornerstone of the health professionals since they monitor heart rate and blood pressure, do diagnostic tests, operate medical equipment, draw blood, and admit and discharge patients depending on physician orders.  She did, however, underline that, despite their role, nurses' efforts are not always recognized by patients and their families inside the health sector, and she pushed for a paradigm shift.  ""Without the contribution and active work of a nurse, no other professional in the health sector can operate; we are the engine in general health delivery, and we must be accorded the due recognition and appreciation,"" said the IMaH Registered General Nurse.  Mr. Samuel Adu Ntiamoah, also a Registered General Nurse at IMaH, contributed to the conversation by underlining the significance of nurses in the healthcare profession.  He argues they are the first point of contact for a patient at the hospital and the last person they see before leaving.  The nurse, according to Mr. Ntiamoah, directs the patient ""to see the doctor and attend the laboratory,"" making them the hospital's heart.  Speaking about patient rights, Mr. Francis Ameyibor, Tema Regional Manager, Ghana News Agency, remarked that a patient has the right to privacy regarding his or her medical condition.  He discovered that communication and compassion foster trust between patients and caretakers, increasing their overall satisfaction.  ""Patients are also more likely to adhere to their treatment recommendations when they are given more information and respect,"" he continues.  Mr. Ameyibor pushed for concerted efforts to educate the people on how to care for and conserve the environment, respect the rights of other patients and health providers, and use and not abuse the health care system responsibly.

Recently, astronomers utilised this telescope's cutting-edge technology to observe a distant star-forming galaxy, delving into its intricate structure with unprecedented detail.  Discovery of the Galaxy  Harnessing the capabilities of NASA's billion-dollar observatory, the James Webb Space Telescope's Orbiter Spacecraft has unveiled the stellar composition of GN20, one of the earliest-known galaxies in the universe. Situated a staggering 12 billion light years away, this captivating discovery represents a luminous and dust-laden star-forming galaxy of extraordinary brilliance.  Significance of the Galaxy  What makes GN20 particularly intriguing is its relatively recent formation, occurring a mere 1.5 billion years after the cataclysmic event known as the Big Bang. Positioned within a region of space referred to as a protocluster or galaxy overdensity, this area holds astronomers' fascination due to its eventual culmination in the formation of colossal galactic clusters.  Insights into the Galaxy's Structure  The captivating image captured by the James Webb Space Telescope allows us to peer back in time when the universe was a mere 1.5 billion years old, as it stands at approximately 13.5 million years presently. Astonishingly, this ancient galaxy boasts a star formation rate approximately 1,860 times greater than the mass of our Sun each year. Astronomers, under the guidance of Luis Colina from the Spanish Astrobiology Centre, employed the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) to examine GN20's structural properties during November 23-24, 2022.  Findings of the Study  Analysis of the MIRI images unveiled a clumpy molecular gas surrounding the galaxy, forming a colossal disk spanning about 46,000 light-years in diameter. Furthermore, the measurements indicated that the galaxy comprises a diffuse gas envelope encompassing a densely packed nucleus of shimmering stars. Remarkably, the nucleus spans a mere 2,600 light-years across, while the gaseous envelope extends approximately 23,000 light-years.  About the James Webb Space Telescope  James Webb Space Telescope stands as NASA's most prominent and powerful space science observatory. Boasting a large infrared telescope with a primary mirror of around 6.5 metres, this state-of-the-art instrument represents a monumental leap forward in our quest to understand the cosmos. It has been positioned a million miles out into space. It orbits the Sun and not the Earth.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3RlY2guaGluZHVzdGFudGltZXMuY29tL3RlY2gvbmV3cy9leHRyYW9yZGluYXJ5LWphbWVzLXdlYmItc3BhY2UtdGVsZXNjb3BlLXNuYXBzLWV4cGxvc2l2ZS1zdGFyLWJpcnRoLWFmdGVyLXRoZS1iaWctYmFuZy03MTY4NDIyMzE1MDY5OS5odG1s0gGYAWh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaC5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vYW1wL3RlY2gvbmV3cy9leHRyYW9yZGluYXJ5LWphbWVzLXdlYmItc3BhY2UtdGVsZXNjb3BlLXNuYXBzLWV4cGxvc2l2ZS1zdGFyLWJpcnRoLWFmdGVyLXRoZS1iaWctYmFuZy03MTY4NDIyMzE1MDY5OS5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"birth","2023-10-05","Not Discerned","{""Early"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 12:54:18","Today, WHO released two new resources to support wider uptake of kangaroo mother care (KMC) – a lifesaving technique which includes ongoing skin-to-skin contact and exclusive breastfeeding – to benefit more small and preterm babies.  Now the leading cause of death of children under 5, prematurity is an urgent public health issue. Every year, an estimated 13.4 million babies are born preterm (before 37 weeks of pregnancy) while an even higher number - over 20 million babies - have a low birthweight (under 2.5 kg at birth). For these babies, KMC is a proven, effective intervention for saving lives and improving their health and development.  “Kangaroo mother care is one of the most critical, lifesaving measures to improve the survival prospects and wellbeing of babies born early or small,” said Dr Anshu Banerjee, Director for Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health at WHO. “Ensuring mothers and babies everywhere can stay together and practice kangaroo mother care immediately after birth will require a radical rethink of how maternal and newborn care is organized - these new publications aim to support this process.”  The two publications - a global position paper and implementation strategy - seek to enable the expansion of KMC within health facilities and at home, globally. They follow the release of landmark new guidelines published last year, which recommend KMC as the essential standard of care for all preterm and low birthweight babies, starting right after birth. The new documents highlight that it should be available both for babies that are well and sick - for at least eight hours a day – including in intensive care.  “For most health facilities, achieving the widespread adoption of kangaroo mother care for all preterm or low birthweight babies will require fundamental changes in newborn care provision, especially neonatal intensive care,” said Dr Shuchita Gupta, Medical Officer at WHO who coordinated the development of the new documents. “This includes changes to the physical layout of care facilities, that enable the mother to stay with her small and sick baby inside the newborn care unit on a 24/7 basis. It also means changing the way healthcare is provided so that obstetricians, midwives, paediatricians, and nurses work together in harmony to care for mothers and babies in one place, as a unit.”  KMC has been shown to significantly improve survival and health outcomes for preterm and low birthweight babies, compared to clinical stabilization in a more ‘high-tech’ incubator or warmer. In fact, data shows it can increase preterm survival rates by as much as a third, reduce infections, prevent hypothermia, and improve feeding and growth. It is also empowering and reassuring for mothers and families who take a leading role in providing care for their infants.  Despite these benefits, only around a third of countries are estimated to have an updated policy or guideline on KMC, meaning millions of preterm and low birthweight babies are likely to be missing out on this lifesaving technique.  The new documents outline some key actions that should be taken to enable the wider adoption and implementation of KMC:  Governments should recognize and include KMC as essential care for all preterm or small babies, ensuring it is financed and monitored – including the necessary infrastructure changes within hospitals - as part of national programmes. Additional parental leave and entitlements can help address the special needs of caregivers of preterm or low birthweight infants so that they can provide the requisite care.  Facilities and healthcare providers should help ensure small and preterm babies can benefit from skin-to-skin contact with their mother for the recommended 8-24 hours a day, starting immediately after birth. Critically, both mother and newborn should receive respectful care, together, as a unit - even when the infant is sick and requires care inside the newborn care unit. Parents and caregivers should be involved in routine care and all aspects of decision-making around care for their newborns. They should be supported – with coaching, emotional and practical assistance - to provide KMC for their small and preterm babies.  Partners and family members can help in providing KMC, providing relief for the mother, stepping in if she is unwell, and helping meet her needs while she is caring for her baby.  Developed in collaboration with a multi-country, multi-stakeholder working group, these resources are directed to governments, programme partners, policy makers and the broader public health community, to help countries expand KMC for babies born early or small. Around the world, WHO is providing ongoing assistance in implementing and scaling up KMC as the foundation of small and/or sick newborn care within national maternal, newborn and child health programmes.  Editor’s note:  The Working Group that developed these documents is comprised of various scientific experts, Ministries of Health and representatives from UN agencies (UNICEF, the World Bank, WHO), bilateral agencies (USAID, Japan International Cooperation Agency -JICA, Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation-NORAD, the Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office of the United Kingdom- UK-FCDO), donor organizations (Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF), Laerdal Foundation), parents groups (European Foundation for the Care of Newborn Infants, FUNDAPREMA, Preemie Connect), professional associations (the American Academy of Pediatrics,, Council of International Neonatal Nurses (COINN), the International Confederation of Midwives, the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO), the International Pediatric Association), and non-governmental organizations (Kangaroo Foundation, Médecins sans Frontières, Save the Children) and specialized partnerships like the Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy53aG8uaW50L25ld3MvaXRlbS8xNi0wNS0yMDIzLW5ldy1yZXNvdXJjZXMtcmVsZWFzZWQtdG8taGVscC1tb3JlLXByZXRlcm0tYW5kLWxvdy1iaXJ0aHdlaWdodC1iYWJpZXMtYmVuZWZpdC1mcm9tLWthbmdhcm9vLW1vdGhlci1jYXJl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The child, born May 13, 2022, is named RZA Athelston Mayers, according to a copy of a birth certificate obtained by the Daily Mail and People.  RZA (pronounced rizz-uh) is also the performing name of Robert Fitzgerald Diggs, the main and founding member of legendary Staten Island hip-hop group Wu Tang Clan. Neither Rihanna or the baby’s father, rapper ASAP Rocky, have commented publicly on their child’s name.  ASAP Rocky, whose real name is Rakim Athelaston Mayers, was also named after hip-hop royalty. He and his sister Erika were named after the Long Island hip-hop duo Eric B. & Rakim, according to 2011 profiles from Pitchfork and Complex.  ASAP Rocky, who grew up in Harlem, has recalled being raised around hip-hop in multiple interviews. Along with other major acts of the 1980s and 1990s, he regularly names the Wu-Tang Clan as among his musical influences.  “I grew up listening to Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, DMX, UGK, Three 6 Mafia, Wu-Tang Clan, everybody,” he told Complex in 2011. “My mum and dad, they came to an agreement and they both named me after Rakim. Honestly, I can’t even meet that guy, man. That would be so crazy.  “I was thinking about naming my child Kanye,” he added with a laugh. ASAP Rocky has collaborated with Kanye West, who now goes by Ye, throughout his career.  Rihanna first revealed she was pregnant with RZA in January 2022 with an Instagram shot of her midsection and ASAP Rocky’s hand resting on her arm. Since giving birth that May, the Grammy-winning singer and business magnate has mostly kept the child from the public eye, sparingly sharing videos of RZA to social media.  She first introduced her son in a TikTok in December and posted a second video in April.  Before posting publicly about her child, with his name still under wraps, Rihanna was asked about her privacy in a November interview with the Associated Press.  “We just didn’t get around to it yet, really,” she said. “We’ve just been living. But I guess there’s a certain freedom that comes with kind of just like getting it out there.”  As rumours swirled of a second child, Rihanna revealed she was pregnant shortly after performing at the Super Bowl LVII halftime show in February.  The Lift Me Up performer and ASAP Rocky are not the first set of famous people to name their child after other famous people.  Fergie and Josh Duhamel, who have since divorced, reportedly named their son, Axl Jack Duhamel, 9, after Guns N’ Roses frontman Axl Rose.  Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon, who have also divorced, named one of their 11-year-old twins, Monroe Cannon, after the late actor Marilyn Monroe, one of Carey’s inspirations, according to ABC News.  David and Victoria Beckham took a more literary route, naming their child, Harper Seven Beckham, after To Kill A Mockingbird author Harper Lee, according to the Guardian. – Los Angeles Times/Tribune News Service","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVzdGFyLmNvbS5teS9saWZlc3R5bGUvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC8yMDIzLzA1LzE2L3JpaGFubmFzLWJhYnlzLW5hbWUtcmV2ZWFsZWQtYS15ZWFyLWFmdGVyLWhpcy1iaXJ0aC0tLWFuZC1pdC1oYXMtYS1iYWNrc3RvcnnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Derry City and Strabane District Council candidate said she’s “delighted” to announce the birth of baby Bennett in recent days as she thanked the “amazing Community Ante-natal Team” in Strabane.  ""I will still be contesting the election in two days’ time, and hope to get back to my campaign soon,” she added.  ""The fact that I have given birth so close to the election will make for a great story for Bennett when he's older.”  Aontú leader Peadar Tóibín TD welcomed the “most fantastic news” for all involved in this campaign.  ""With politics there is always a lot of negativity, especially so close to the finish line, but this brilliant news reaching us, of the birth of baby Bennett, has put a smile on all Aontú faces across the island, and given us all a fantastic boost of happiness.  ""In congratulating Leza and her family, I want to pay tribute to her hard work in this campaign. Leza Houston is a working student, currently studying Law in Ulster University.  ""She lives in West Tyrone with her young family. Leza’s passion for human rights motivated her to get involved in politics.

Speaking at the time she was selected, she added: “I believe in the traditional Republican vision that all the children of the nation should be cherished equally.”  Mrs Houston continued: ""I am especially frustrated with what’s happening to my county of Tyrone. The cost of living crisis is hurting so many families.  ""That people are going without food and heat while the political establishment are sitting on their hands in Stormont is not good enough.  ""We are calling on MLAs to lose their salaries if they won't do their job. It would not be tolerated in any other walk of life.

The Director, Vital Registration, Mathew Sunday, disclosed this to our correspondent on Tuesday.  It would be recalled that the United Nations Children’s Fund, on Friday said only 33 per cent of children in Nigeria have birth certificates.  UNICEF’s Chief of Kano Field Office, Rahama Farah, stated this during a stakeholders’ meeting on birth registration organised by UNICEF in collaboration with the NPC in Kano.  Farah, represented by the Senior Education Specialist, Michael Banda, said, “The Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey MICS 2021 shows that about one in every four births of Nigerian children aged under five years are not registered. According to MICS 2021, only 33 per cent of these registered children have a birth certificate.”  Giving updates on the efforts thus far by the NPC in ensuring that children in Nigeria get registered at birth, Sunday said, “We are collaborating with the health sector, especially the Primary Health Care. We are going to have a meeting very soon with all the stakeholders in the health sector. We are going digital.  “We are automating the processes of childbirth registration to ensure that there will be no double registration and for the purpose of probability. We are working with other sister agencies such as the Federal Ministry of Health and the National Bureau of Statistics because sharing data on the analogue platform is very difficult.  “A lot of children are born outside medical facilities, especially in rural areas. One measure that we have adopted is that we have found out that these children are immunised, irrespective of where they are born.  “We have been collaborating with the health sector for years but it is not enough. We are now moving into integrating birth registration into the health sector activities. For instance, on the immunisation card of a child, one will see a column if a child is registered and if not, the health personnel will advise the parents to go register the child.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vcHVuY2huZy5jb20vbnBjLXBsYW5zLXRvLWRpZ2l0aXNlLWJpcnRoLXJlZ2lzdHJhdGlvbi_SAUFodHRwczovL3B1bmNobmcuY29tL25wYy1wbGFucy10by1kaWdpdGlzZS1iaXJ0aC1yZWdpc3RyYXRpb24vP2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Toiréasa had been feeling some pains throughout the night on Tuesday so, when Barry came down ready for work, she told him to stay off so he could be close in case anything happened.  Toiréasa said: “I phoned the hospital in the morning but I was told to keep an eye on things for the meantime. We decided to go for a walk and lunch in the Sandwich Company at 1pm.

""Total creativity involves a certain degree of rebellion. To be completely creative, I tend to do things that are a little bit forbidden,"" said Eaves, who has fully controlled the distillation, aging and bottling of Forbidden from grain to glass. ""While creating Forbidden, I have had the freedom to cross deep into uncharted territory by using nontraditional ingredients and techniques. The resulting bourbon, on my palate, is perfection.""  Photos are available to download photos here.  The first release of Forbidden is a small batch, hand-blended 5-year-old bourbon bottled at 95.2 proof. This bold and elegant expression is beautifully balanced and complex. Forbidden's unique blend of cuisine-quality white corn, white winter wheat and malted barley give it a sweet and smooth profile. Darker notes balance Forbidden and originate from both charred barrels and fruity, floral yeast. Aroma leads with vanilla bean and crème brûlée, dried fruit, hazelnut, light sweet citrus notes and gentle layered spice. The palate: caramel, citrus oil and delicate floral along with baking spices, oak sugar, soft chewy sweet with a hint of grain. The finish lingers creamy sweetness with oak and spice.

While Moakler has reportedly not had the best relationship with her youngest child, she has made multiple attempts to find and build a connection between them. In a recent effort, the reality star uploaded a throwback image that she used to announce Alabama’s arrival into the world in 2005. She shares the teen with her ex-husband and musician Travis Barker.  Shanna Moakler Threw It Back To The Day She Announced The Arrival Of Her Baby Girl  It is not throwback Thursday yet, but December 24, 2005, will always hold a special place in Moakler’s as it was the third time she would become a mother. Even though the Miss Teen USA 1992 rep had welcomed two other kids — Atiana De La Hoya and Landon Barker, she was still ecstatic to hold the adorable chub in her arms.  To announce the big news, the doting mom created a Hollywood-inspired poster featuring the newborn sporting a serious look in the middle. Alabama was donned in a long-sleeved outfit, a blanket, and a head warmer.  Above her were numerous statements expressing joy, such as “2 thumbs way up!” “The cutest baby ever!” “She’ll laugh, she’ll cry, she’ll mess up her diaper!” and “Put her on your “must see” list for 2005/2006.”  The announcement banner also included a five-star rating for the tot, along with her full name, date and location of her birth, her weight at birth, and the doctor in charge of the labor. “She had the coolest birth announcement ever lol,” the enamored Moakler wrote under the pic, which she shared via her Instagram Story.  The Rhode Island native had most recently tried to work on her and Alabama’s tumultuous bond by trying to get her hooked on one of her favorite pastimes, gaming. Per The Blast, the mother-of-three had taken time from her busy schedule to play video games with the 17-year-old.  She shared evidence of their excellent time through an image that showed the teenager lying on a couch with headphones on her head. The Internet personality wore a pink and white striped two-piece set that could pass for pajamas for the occasion.  She finished her pose by throwing the peace sign at the camera, concealing her mouth and nose from view. However, the bits that could be seen showcased her slightly made-up face, consisting of a barely noticeable winged eyeliner.  Alabama’s hair was also styled perfectly, tucked under what appeared to be a multicolored bonnet. Tagging her, her mother penned, “I’m making a gamer out of her 😂😂😘,” across the image.  The ‘Search Party’ Celebrity Contestant Slammed Travis Barker’s New Wife On Her Birthday  Anybody who has recently followed the news is well aware of the tension between Moakler and Travis’ current wife, Kourtney Kardashian. However, in case you are unaware, the former Playboy Playmate of the Month has never shied away from airing her dislike for the Poosh founder publicly, and she did so again during the latter’s 44th birthday festivities.  The moment occurred after she uploaded a photo of herself wearing makeup following the premiere of her ex-husband and Kardashian’s wedding special, “Til Death Do Us Part,” in April.  “I hope that you get a huge apology some day for what was said on that exploitative, money grabbing, circus,” one fan had commented under the post, earning a like from the “Pacific Blue” series regular.  A second person had then chimed in, “Also kourtney wrote on twitter she’s now a mom of 6,” referring to the three children the D-A-S-H co-owner shares with ex-partner Scott Disick — Mason, Penelope, and Reign — in addition to her husband and Moakler’s three kids.  The “Friends ‘Til the End” star promptly responded, “she post more of my kids then [sic] her own lol.” She had previously taken a swipe at another Kardashian, when a fan mistook her for Khloe.  At the time, the netizen had written, “Literally thought that was Khloe Kardashian!” under another Instagram post. Moakler did not hesitate before dropping, “khloe doesn’t even look like khloe what are you people smoking lol.”  Judging by the amount of likes the reply received; it is clear that people shared the same sentiment and were glad to see it finally said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlYmxhc3QuY29tLzQ4ODI0NC9zaGFubmEtbW9ha2xlci1yZWNhbGxzLWRhdWdodGVyLWFsYWJhbWFzLWNvb2xlc3QtYmlydGgtYW5ub3VuY2VtZW50LWV2ZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Emma Taylor, 33, from Chelmsford, was around seven months pregnant when she was rushed to hospital after collapsing one evening in October 2022.  Emma was taken straight into A&E where doctors examined her and said Emma needed to deliver her baby immediately. But soon after the birth, doctors found Emma had a bleed on the brain, and she was airlifted to Queen's Hospital in Romford, where they discovered she had a huge tumour at the base of her skull.  Emma's partner Scott Weeks, 47, spoke to EssexLive, saying that October 13 began as a normal day, but soon descended into chaos. While out buying some bits and pieces for the baby, Emma was suddenly hit by a severe headache and told Scott she was going to have to go to bed to sleep it off.  Read more: Essex woman, 22, with 34H breasts denied NHS reduction surgery due to BMI  But at around 7pm that evening, Scott heard a thump: ""She was sprawled out on the floor, she literally looked like she'd fallen out of bed."" Emma was slurring and said she couldn't move her left side. Scott said: ""That sent alarm bells ringing as I thought, oh my god, this is much more serious than I thought.""  He and a neighbour eventually drove Emma to Broomfield Hospital, as Scott was told an ambulance would take four hours to arrive. She was soon examined by doctors, who told Scott Emma was going to have to deliver her baby immediately.  (Image: Scott Weeks)  Emma and Scott's daughter Ophelia was born at 9.08pm on October 13, and while she was a little small and had a slight breathing problem initially, she was healthy. Scott said: ""I was thinking, this is not quite what we'd planned. Our visions of us leaving hospital together in the usual romantic way with the baby seat and whatnot, suddenly that dream was decimated.""  The doctors came back and said Emma had a bleed on the brain. Scott said: ""That's never a pleasant thing. I remember just sitting there thinking, what the hell is happening. I have never felt so parched in my life.""  Scott continued: ""I felt sorrow for the fact that Emma was not only missing the events but she was potentially in a place that was going to take her out of her daughter's life for a fair while."" Broomfield Hospital isn't equipped for the specialist neurological treatment Emma needed, so she was airlifted to Queen's Hospital in Romford.  Scott said: ""She had another scan and it wasn't a pretty sight."" Emma had a tumour around 60mm long that had grown around the base of her skull and was wrapped around the spinal column underneath her brain.  Scott said: ""It was really kind of 50-50 whether she was going to make it through the night because they said the bleed could be so brutal they potentially couldn't do anything with her."" But by the next morning, Emma had stabilised and they were able to operate the next day.  (Image: Scott Weeks)  On Tuesday, November 1, Emma had surgery and two-thirds of the tumour was removed. The surgeon said Emma had not sustained any brain damage and the tumour was found to be non-cancerous.  Scott said: ""The surgeon predicted a sound recovery. With dedicated physiotherapy he saw that she should be able to live a relatively normal life with some impairment to her left side ability.""  After a few weeks, Emma started breathing by herself again and was moved off the ICU ward and back to Broomfield Hospital. It was while Emma was back at Broomfield that Scott remembers bringing Ophelia in for a dietitian appointment, and Emma had regained consciousness.  Scott said: ""It was an absolute miracle as the surgeon had said that consciousness would be her biggest hurdle because of the damage."" He explained that the right-hand brainstem, which had been damaged by the tumour, was like the brain's 'starter motor'.  Scott continued: ""So without that she could have been unconscious for the rest of her life, and that would have been it."" Emma was moved to Northwick Park hospital in north London, where she started a three-month rehabilitation programme funded by the NHS.  Emma has already made some progress in the months of rehab she's had. Emma was mostly paralysed from the neck down, but she's slowly started to regain some dexterity again, moving her thumb and fingers, then her toes.  Scott said: ""It's a very slow process. The frustrating thing is they say the rehabilitation for this kind of injury can be two years. Three months is not really enough to get someone back on their feet.""  (Image: Scott Weeks)  Emma has now been moved to a 'soft rehab', which is far less intense in supporting her recovery. Scott said: ""My problem with that is yes, eventually she should make the recovery we hope for, but it's just delaying the amount of time she's missing with her daughter. And I just didn't feel like that was a fair trade off.""  Scott says these first six months of bringing Ophelia up without Emma has been tough. He tries to involve Emma as much as he can with Ophelia, from letting her choose Ophelia's clothes to where their daughter should go to nursery.  But due to visiting times, Emma can only see Ophelia for a couple of hours a week, so Scott tries to keep Emma up to date by showing her lots of photos and videos. Scott says: ""Emma's very aware of what's going on and what she's missing. She does cry, we have some tears.""  At the moment, Emma still is unable to speak, but communicates through nodding and shaking her head, and can put her thumb up or down in agreement or disagreement. Scott said: ""She wants to be given the best shot of speeding up the process [of recovery].""  Scott has started a fundraiser to pay for Emma to continue more intensive physiotherapy privately, so she can come home in less than 12 months, he hopes. There has been a huge amount of local support, partly because Emma was so well-loved by everyone in Chelmsford, Scott said.  He said: ""She was a dedicated local dental hygienist and she'd been serving in Essex for over 10 years. I guess I'm just looking to get her the same kind of treatment she's given her patients over time.  ""I've had hundreds of them come to me and say she's amazing and donated, and that's really what I think she deserves."" Scott added: ""It's amazing that in times like this, when we put our heads together, we can achieve amazing things.  And not a lot of money from a lot of people can make a huge difference to this girl's life and her daughter's."" The fundraiser has only been running for a couple of weeks, but Scott has already raised more than £55,000 for Emma's rehab.  Emma is a very calm and caring person, Scott said, and always thoughtful and considerate of everyone around her. Scott said: ""She's a very well-liked person, and missed by everybody.""  A spokesperson for the London North West University Healthcare NHS Trust, which runs Northwick Park hospital, said: “Hyperacute rehabilitation units (HRUs) are highly specialised and patients are moved on once their medical condition is stabilised. Their ongoing treatment is not determined by resources and the handful of hospitals trusts hosting HRUs work closely with their local continuing healthcare teams to ensure their on- going rehabilitation in accordance with their needs.”  You can donate to the fundraiser here.

A woman who attempted to hide more than three pounds of cocaine under a fake pregnant belly has been apprehended by law enforcement officers. In the process of evading the authorities, the contraband fell out of the rubber belly that was allegedly attached to her.  So in a way, she gave birth to over 1,500 grams of cocaine.

During The Traffic Stop  During a proactive patrol on April 12th, officers from the Anderson County Sheriff's Office pulled over Anthony Miller and Cemeka Mitchem, residents of Charlotte, while traveling along Interstate 85. The reason for the stop was attributed to Miller's erratic driving behavior, as he drove haphazardly, crossing lanes of traffic and nearly colliding with a semi-truck.  Public Information Officer, Shale Remien, told ABC News that Miller and Mitchem appeared apprehensive during the stop and went out of their way to inform officers that Mitchem was pregnant. Nevertheless, conflicting information regarding her due date, as well as differing details about their intended destination, alerted officers to the possibility of criminal activity.  ""The first red flag began when the two gave conflicting information about her 'due date,'"" the release from the office said.  According to police, Mitchem fled from the officers as they grew increasingly suspicious of the ""conflicting story"" offered by the couple, and in the process, drugs fell out of a rubber stomach she had been carrying.  ""Mitchem immediately took off running and very quickly drugs fell from the fake rubber stomach,"" the release noted.

Even if you focused on one mom, you probably assumed she was confident and knew how to handle her baby. After all, she's the mom and she knows what the baby wants and needs.  Then you gave birth, and you found that motherhood came with some uncertainty, fear and confusion. Sometimes, you feel that you don't always know what your little baby wants and how to satisfy their needs.  Now you know that behind every mom with a stroller or a baby carrier were long minutes of necessary organization, many things that they're not allowed to forget, and maybe even a wish that this short trip will pass without hysterical crying, diaper surprises or any stressful comments from unknown passersby.  Now a week, two weeks, or a month after giving birth you may be ready to go out with your newborn child. It can be to the baby development clinic, to the post office, for a scheduled activity or just to get fresh air. Regardless of where it is you’re going, every outing requires you to be organized physically and mentally. In order to have a great time with your baby, look at this guide.  Equip yourself with what you need, but don't overload  You won't be out for long, so don't take the entire house with you. Yet, there are some basic things that are important to have in your stroller bag, even for half an hour of walking around:  Woman walking with stroller (illustrative). (credit: Wikimedia Commons)  A few diapers, two disposable diaper pads, cream, wipes and plastic trash bags.  Clothing: dress the baby in clothes suitable for the weather and always remember to take a change of clothes with you because there will be times the baby manages to poop all over his body. It will happen, albeit hopefully not too often.  Clean blanket  Feeding: Make sure to have a blanket you can wear when nursing, a bottle of water and a can of formula with a measuring scoop. Always take extra; you might be delayed in your return home.  Two pacifiers and some small toys for them to hold while you change them.  A carrier to store in the bottom of the baby carriage or pushchair. An activity mat or blanket suitable to use outdoors.  Don't forget to look out for yourself  And it's true that the baby requires most of the things you’ll be taking with you, but don’t forget that you need a few things too.  Take with you:  A charged phone, wallet, keys and water bottle  Snacks if you don’t want to sit in a cafe  Hand sanitizer  Take into account that the baby will cry  All babies cry. Obviously, it's great if a baby sleeps or is in a good mood, but it’s entirely possible that something will upset them, and you’ll need to respond.  First- breathe deeply. Even if you don't manage to quickly calm down the baby, no one's looking at you. Block out background noise and concentrate only on you and the baby.  Plan a route but be open to changes  In order to remain calm, the first time you take the baby out, choose a route you know. Don't walk on narrow streets or those filled with pedestrians, or go places you know are too steep.  For a first walk go to a park, or quiet streets near your home. You can deviate from the planned route and walk more but remember, however far you walk, you’ll also have to walk back with the baby.  Track the weather  Winter? Make sure it isn't too cold or rainy. Summer? Don't go out if it's really hot and humid. Stay in if it's hazy or very windy.  Don't be afraid to breastfeed outside  At first, nursing in public seems impossible but you'll get used to it. Still, take a blanket to cover you and don't worry if anyone sees you nursing.  Good luck with going out with your baby, especially the first few times. You're a champion mom and everything will be fine!

It seeks to understand how these cosmic events can influence a person’s life based on their birth date and time.  The concept of assigning different symbols for each month dates back centuries, with many ancient cultures believing that certain stones, flowers, or colors have special meanings and powers. This tradition has been passed down through generations and continues to be embraced by people around the world today.  For example, each birth month is associated with a specific flower that represents qualities that are believed to reflect the personality traits of individuals born during that month. These flowers vary from delicate lilies for those born in May to passionate roses for those born in June. Each birth flower blooms in the corresponding month, so be sure to pick a bouquet for yourself during your birth month.  Only The Top 1% Can Ace our Animal Quizzes Think You Can?

Overall, astrology provides an intriguing lens through which we can examine our lives and personalities more deeply – even if you don’t believe it holds any real truth or value beyond simple entertainment!  January — Carnation and Snowdrop  Carnations are one of two flowers for January. ©Diamant Studios/Shutterstock.com  As we delve into the world of birth month flowers, let us take a closer look at the carnation and snowdrop — two beautiful blooms that represent individuals born in January.  The carnation is known for its delicate beauty and subtle fragrance. This flower can come in a wide range of colors, including pink, red, white, yellow, and even purple. The petals are fringed with a unique texture that adds to their charm.  In ancient times, this flower was believed to have healing properties and was used as a remedy for various ailments such as fever or inflammation. It is also associated with love and admiration; hence it makes an ideal gift for someone you hold dear.  On the other hand, snowdrops symbolize hope and purity. These small yet elegant blossoms bloom during late winter when everything else seems dull and lifeless. They usually appear as drooping white bells accompanied by slender green leaves.  Their sweet scent has been described as having hints of honey or vanilla, which add to their allure. The snowdrop’s arrival signifies the end of winter’s harshness, giving way to new beginnings, thus making them perfect adornments for weddings or christenings.  So if you’re looking for something special to gift someone born in January or just want some lovely flowers around your home during these colder months- carnations or snowdrops may be just what you need!  February — Violet and Primrose  Primroses are beautiful flowers that symbolize new beginnings. © K.Jagielski/Shutterstock.com  For those born in February, the birth month flowers are violet and primrose. These two flowers not only offer a beautiful display of colors but also have significant meanings attached to them.  The violet is a small, delicate flower that blooms in shades of purple, blue, and white. Its petals fan out from its center, creating an intricate design that has captured the hearts of many for centuries. The plant itself grows low to the ground with heart-shaped leaves, making it perfect for borders or filler plants in garden beds. Violets are known for their sweet scent, which can range from mild to strong depending on their variety.  Primroses, on the other hand, come in various shapes and sizes but typically bloom as clusters of small flowers ranging from pale pink to deep reds and purples. They often grow taller than violets, with larger leaves resembling rosettes at times. Like violets, primroses are fragrant with scents ranging from sweet floral notes to subtle fruity undertones.  To someone born in February, the violet signifies faithfulness, loyalty, and devotion, while the primrose represents young love or new beginnings. Both qualities fit perfectly into this month’s theme, celebrating romance and renewal.  As far as blooming seasons go, violets tend to bloom early spring through late summer while primroses prefer cooler weather conditions like early spring or fall, where temperatures do not exceed 70 degrees Fahrenheit.  In conclusion: If you’re looking for a meaningful gift for your loved one born in February, consider a bouquet of violets and primroses.  March — Daffodil  New cultivars of daffodils have sweet scents. ©Tony Baggett/Shutterstock.com  Daffodils are beautiful and vibrant flowers that typically bloom in the early spring months. With their bright yellow petals and delicate trumpet-shaped centers, they are truly a sight to behold. The daffodil is known for symbolizing new beginnings, rebirth, and fresh starts — all fitting themes for those born in March who celebrate their birthday during this time of year.  In terms of fragrance, daffodils do not have a particularly strong scent, although newer cultivars are sweetly scented. However, some people describe them as having a subtle yet sweet aroma that can be quite pleasant when encountered up close.  When it comes to blooming times, daffodils typically start appearing in gardens and fields around mid-March through April, depending on the climate zone. They thrive best in moist soil conditions with plenty of sunlight exposure.  Overall, if you’re looking for a cheerful and iconic flower to represent your birth month or simply enjoy admiring nature’s beauty during the springtime season, then look no further than the lovely daffodil!  April — Sweet Pea and Daisy  Daisies are one of two flowers for the month of April. ©M9K/Shutterstock.com  As we move into April, the birth month flowers are sweet peas and daisies. Sweet peas are known for their delicate appearance and sweet fragrance. These flowers have a romantic feel to them, with their ruffled petals in shades of pink, purple, white, or red. They grow on long stems that can reach up to six feet tall and bloom from late spring to early summer.  Daisies, on the other hand, have a more simplistic look with their bright yellow center surrounded by white petals. However, they also come in different colors, such as pink or red depending on the species. daisies are often associated with innocence and purity but can also symbolize new beginnings or loyalty.  For those born in April who share these flowers as their birth month symbols, there is significant meaning behind each one. The sweet pea represents blissful pleasure, while the daisy signifies purity and innocence of heart – both traits commonly found among people born under this zodiac sign.  As for fragrance, sweet peas exude a beautiful scent that has been described as honey-like with subtle hints of fruitiness, while daisies typically do not have any scent at all.  In terms of when they bloom, sweet peas usually start blooming around late spring through early summer, whereas daisies tend to flower throughout most seasons except winter.  Overall if you’re looking for some unique yet meaningful gifts for someone special in your life born during this time period, then sweet pea and daisy bouquets may be perfect options!  May — Hawthorn and Lily of the Valley  Lily of the Valley flowers smells like honey. ©Agnes Kantaruk/Shutterstock.com  May babies have two birth month flowers to choose from — the hawthorn and lily of the valley. These stunning blooms are not only beautiful but also hold special meanings for those born in May.  The hawthorn is a small tree or shrub that produces delicate white or pink flowers in late spring. Its branches are spiny, and its leaves are lobed, creating an overall striking appearance. In terms of symbolism, the hawthorn represents hope and happiness as well as protection against evil spirits.  On the other hand, the lily of the valley is a fragrant woodland plant with bell-shaped white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. This flower symbolizes humility, sweetness, and purity. It has been used throughout history for medicinal purposes such as treating heart conditions but should be handled with care as all parts of it are poisonous if ingested.  Both these birth month flowers emit exquisite scents that can fill up any room they’re placed in! The sweet aroma of lily-of-the-valley has hints of honey, while hawthorns have notes of citrusy freshness mixed with floral undertones.  When do these blooms grace us with their presence? While both flower during May (as per tradition), hawthorns tend to begin blooming mid-May onwards, whereas lilies typically bloom towards the beginning half of this month.  In summary, May-born individuals can take pride in having two beautiful birth month flowers to represent them. The elegant hawthorn exudes optimism and protection, whilst the breathtakingly fragrant lily stands for purity and new beginnings.  June — Rose and Honeysuckle  Roses come in single or double-flowering varieties. ©Isabelle OHara/Shutterstock.com  If you’re a person born in June, your birth month flowers are the rose and honeysuckle. These two flowers have unique characteristics that make them stand out among other blooms. The rose is a classic flower that has been used for centuries to symbolize love, admiration, and beauty. It comes in various colors, such as red, pink, yellow, white, or even black.  The appearance of the rose varies depending on its species. Some roses bloom with large petals, while others have smaller ones. They also come in different shapes, like single blooms or clusters of buds. One thing they all share, though, is their sweet fragrance which can range from light to strong.  On the other hand, honeysuckles are known for their delicate tubular shape and bright colors ranging from pale yellows to deep oranges and pinks. Their sweet aroma attracts hummingbirds and bees, who help pollinate them so they can produce more flowers.  For those born in June, these two flowers hold special meanings that reflect their character traits. Roses represent love and passion, while honeysuckles signify sweetness and devotion towards family members or loved ones.  Roses typically bloom during late spring through early summer but may vary depending on where you live – some species may be available throughout the year too! Meanwhile, honeysuckles tend to blossom between the May-June period when conditions are optimal for growth.  July — Water Lily and Larkspur  Water lilies are the flower of July. ©Papp Szabolcs/Shutterstock.com  Water lilies and larkspur are the two birth month flowers for July. These flowers have unique appearances that make them stand out from other plants. Water lilies are aquatic plants with large, showy blooms that float on the surface of still or slow-moving water. They come in a range of colors, including white, pink, yellow, and red, with some varieties exhibiting delicate patterns on their petals. On the other hand, larkspur is tall and slender with spikes of small flowers ranging from blue to purple to pinkish-red.  For individuals born in July, these flowers hold special meaning. The water lily symbolizes purity of heart, while the larkspur represents strong bonds of love and affection which makes it an ideal gift for weddings or anniversaries. Both flowers exude a sweet fragrance; however, there is no definitive scent as different species may produce different aromas.  Water lilies usually bloom between June to September when temperatures are warmer, while larkspurs typically blossom in early summer through fall, depending on the climate conditions where they grow best.  August — Gladiolus and Poppy  Poppies are a symbol of everlasting life. ©MierCat Photography/Shutterstock.com  If you were born in August, the gladiolus and poppy flowers are your birth month flowers. Both of these vibrant blooms have their own unique characteristics that make them stand out amongst other flowers.  The gladiolus flower is characterized by its tall and slender stem with multiple blooms arranged in rows. This elegant flower comes in a variety of colors, including pink, red, yellow, orange, white, and purple. The meaning behind the gladiolus varies depending on the color it bears – for example, pink represents love and infatuation, while white signifies purity and innocence. Typically blooming from the late summer to early fall months (July-October), this hardy plant requires full sun exposure to thrive.  On the other hand, poppies boast their delicate petals, which come in shades of bright reds or oranges with black centers that look like buttons. Symbolizing imagination’s power over death or remembrance during wartime when remembering fallen heroes, poppies’ significance can vary based on culture as well as their location around the world, but they remain one of nature’s most beautiful offerings for those who adore them! They bloom throughout midsummer to early fall (usually June-August), providing an array of colorful hues to gardens around North America.  When it comes to scent, both flowers don’t usually emit any strong fragrance though some varieties may give off a subtle sweet aroma that attracts pollinators such as bees or butterflies towards them.  September — Morning Glory and Aster  Morning glories love to climb up fences and trellises. ©iStock.com/Wakhron  September is a special month for those born during this time as they have not just one but two beautiful birth flowers to celebrate their entry into the world. The morning glory and aster are both stunning blooms that hold unique meanings and significance.  The morning glory has an enchanting appearance with its trumpet-shaped petals that come in shades of blue, purple, pink, white, and red. This flower is known for its delicate beauty and symbolizes love, affection, mortality, rejuvenation, and rebirth. It’s also believed to represent unrequited love or even past memories.  On the other hand, asters are small daisy-like flowers with long stems that come in vibrant colors such as pink, lavender, or white. These blossoms commonly bloom from late summer through early fall, when most other plants start to fade away. Asters are associated with wisdom, faith, patience, good luck, valor, and admiration – all great qualities that September babies tend to embody themselves!  While morning glories don’t have much fragrance on their own (unless you get close enough!), some hybrids have been bred specifically for scent purposes. So if it matters enough to you, then seek out these options at your local nursery! On the other hand, asters carry a light floral aroma similar to chamomile tea which is soothing and calming.  Both flowers typically reach full bloom around mid-September, allowing them plenty of time throughout the rest of the autumn season before winter arrives. So whether you choose one type over another – or opt for both together, they are sure to brighten any fall day.  October — Marigold  Marigolds are long-blooming flowers, lasting clear until October in some areas. ©FunFamilyRu/Shutterstock.com  Marigold flowers belong to the genus Tagetes, which includes about 56 species of plants native to the Americas. These bright and cheerful flowers are known for their vibrant color and unique fragrance, which varies depending on the species.  Marigolds typically bloom in late spring or early summer, although some varieties can flower throughout the year. They are characterized by their daisy-like appearance with brightly colored petals ranging from yellow, orange, and red to maroon. The leaves of marigold plants are usually dark green and slightly hairy.  For people born in October, marigolds hold a special significance as they represent love and passion. In many cultures around the world, these flowers are also associated with celebration and joyous occasions such as weddings and festivals.  Apart from their symbolic meaning, marigolds have several practical uses as well. Their pungent aroma helps repel insects like mosquitoes and other pests that could harm garden crops. Extracts from certain types of marigold plants have also been used for medicinal purposes due to their anti-inflammatory properties.  In conclusion, marigolds are not only beautiful but versatile too – they serve both ornamental purposes in gardens while being functional at keeping pests away!  November — Chrysanthemum  Chrysanthemum blossoms are a lovely sight in the late fall. ©Volodymyr Yakovyna/Shutterstock.com  Chrysanthemums are beautiful flowers that come in a variety of colors, ranging from white and yellow to red and purple. They have a unique appearance, with many small petals clustered together in a circular shape.  For those born in November, the chrysanthemum holds special significance as it is their birth month flower. The meaning behind this flower varies depending on culture and context but typically represents optimism, joy, longevity, and good luck.  When it comes to scent, chrysanthemums do not have an overwhelming fragrance, but they do emit a subtle sweet aroma that can be enjoyed up close.  These flowers typically bloom during late summer through fall, which makes them perfect for autumn arrangements or decorations. However, certain varieties, like the Korean chrysanthemum, can bloom even into winter months.  In summary, chrysanthemums are stunning flowers known for their unique appearance and subtle sweetness. Their inclusion as November’s birth month flower adds special meaning for those with birthdays during this time of year.  December — Holly  Holly flowers and berries last throughout winter. ©EveTravels/Shutterstock.com  As we explore the birth month flowers, December brings us the beautiful holly flower. The holly plant is typically characterized by its deep green leaves and vibrant red berries that are often associated with the holiday season. Its appearance exudes a sense of festivity and joy, making it a popular decorative choice during Christmas time.  For those born in December, the holly flower holds significant meaning as it symbolizes strength and protection. This may be attributed to the plant’s ability to thrive even in harsh winter conditions, serving as a reminder for individuals born in this month to remain unyielding amidst adversity.  While not known for their fragrance, holly plants do produce small white flowers that bloom between May and June before maturing into bright red berries later in the year. These berries are not only visually stunning but also serve as an important food source for birds during wintertime when other sources of sustenance may be scarce.  Overall, the holly flower represents resilience and hopefulness — qualities that can inspire those born under its symbolic significance to persevere through challenges while maintaining a positive outlook on life.

We imagine women who come to the United States from other nations — particularly a great many in Latin America, Europe or Africa — asking some version of that question upon learning the pills are not available here for sale over the counter, as they are in 100 other countries around the globe.  Thankfully, this could soon be changing.  An advisory panel of the Food and Drug Administration has recommended that OTC sales of a particular birth control pill be allowed. Though this is only the next step in the process, with the full FDA still needing to sign off, the agency seldom bucks an advisory group’s recommendation.  Sales without a prescription are likely coming soon and that is a good development.  After the Supreme Court last year overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that made abortion legal in all 50 states, the need for women to be able to secure birth control pills as easily as possible became more pressing than ever.  But for far too many women, obtaining pills is anything but straightforward.  The FDA advisory panel has recommended that Opill, a daily contraceptive made by HRA Pharma, be made available for sale over the counter. Though this move involves just one pill, another company that manufactures another birth control pill has also applied for sales over the counter. For the sake of all women, this should be only the start, with other companies offering their own pills following suit, and FDA approval becoming increasingly routine.  This is an issue for all women, but it is of particular importance for those who lack significant financial resources and for women of color. If poorer Black and Hispanic women cannot gain access to birth control pills, while more well-to-do white women can, that’s patently unjust.  Every woman — white, Black, Hispanic, native American, rich, poor, you name it — needs to have access to birth control pills. Without a prescription.  This ought not be controversial.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc3NsaXZlLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uLzIwMjMvMDUvd29tZW4tbmVlZC1mdWxsLWFjY2Vzcy10by1iaXJ0aC1jb250cm9sLWVkaXRvcmlhbC5odG1s0gFuaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFzc2xpdmUuY29tL29waW5pb24vMjAyMy8wNS93b21lbi1uZWVkLWZ1bGwtYWNjZXNzLXRvLWJpcnRoLWNvbnRyb2wtZWRpdG9yaWFsLmh0bWw_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Giving birth to my third child, I agreed to let five students — in addition to a midwife, my husband, and my parents on Facetime — observe me in this very vulnerable moment, something I couldn't have imagined years before.  8 Kimberly Gladden-Eversley let nine people watch her give birth to her third child Credit: Courtesy Kimberly Gladden-Eversley  8 She admitted she wasn't always so comfortable with her body, but she realized: 'Body positivity starts with me' Credit: Courtesy Kimberly Gladden-Eversley  The body positivity movement has garnered the attention of women around the globe who desperately want acceptance — and yes, I was one of them.  From trendy diets, hour-long Tik Tok-worthy skincare routines, and waist trainers that will suck the life out of you — if you have seen it, I’ve probably tried it.  Despite the efforts of this movement, filtered photos, carefully angled poses, and edited bodies continue to take over our social media newsfeeds — and I admit, I've done it plenty of times.  I was body-shamed for not having note-worthy curves like Beyonce or the voluptuous genes that led to our obsession with plastic surgery.  So here I was, in my early 20s, forcibly poking out what my mama never gave me, hoping to generate likes and approval from an audience who would forget my existence by their next newsfeed scroll.  It wasn’t until seven years ago, when I was in labor during my third pregnancy, that I realized body positivity starts with me.  As I felt like I was splitting in half while I naturally fought through each contraction, my midwife asked if she could invite her med students into my delivery room.  Impressed by my laboring skills, she looked at me and said: “Kimberly, you are doing amazing. Would it be ok if I invite my med students in the room?”  You probably think I would never spread it wide for the world to see and told her: ""No way!""  Well, yes way, and without hesitation, I agreed.  After two back-to-back natural deliveries prior to this one, I felt like a purple-heart medal-wearing veteran ready for battle.  At this point, I could take on anything because fear had officially left the building, and my body had already proven how powerful it was before.  Within minutes, my quiet delivery room turned into a classroom with at least five students staring at my bare body.  Each student walked into the room wearing a permanent smile, exuding nervous excitement while anxiously preparing to witness their first live childbirth.  8 When her midwife asked if several students could come in and watch her give birth, she agreed Credit: Courtesy Kimberly Gladden-Eversley  In between contractions, we’d make eye contact that was complemented by reassuring words of encouragement: “You got this,” “You were so made for this,” “Wow, she is amazing.”  Eagerly standing in my room, we represented beauty in its natural form without an ounce of makeup, fake eyelashes, or selfie-worthy attire.  As I took off each layer of clothing, preparing to bring life into the world, I could feel the insecurities about my appearance quickly slip away.  I didn’t worry about the harsh judgment I’d receive or their thoughts about my body.  I wasn’t as concerned about my disproportionate curves or my nose, which had recently doubled in size as much as I was just a week ago.  I didn’t care about the pregnancy acne I’d cover up before posting with too much lighting and overly saturated filters.  I wasn’t concerned if anyone would pick me apart until nothing was left.  8 'Admittedly, the intensity of the pain increased my disconnection from the world around me,' she said Credit: Courtesy Kimberly Gladden-Eversley  I was too focused on the mission and massively in tune with the present moment, carefully monitoring each stage of labor as it rapidly progressed.  Admittedly, the intensity of the pain increased my disconnection from the world around me.  I probably wouldn’t have cared if Oprah decided to show up with a team of cameras for a feature on The Masterclass.  You probably think I would never spread it wide for the world to see and told her: ""No way!"" Well, yes way, and without hesitation, I agreed.  I felt powerful, called, liberated, and, most importantly, free.  The girl who was called “too skinny” suddenly had hips wide enough to deliver a baby safely and naturally for the third time.  The girl with acne-prone skin that required good lighting and concealer suddenly had skin strong enough to carry a full-term baby.  The girl, whose legs were called sticks, could stand tall, completely nude, while pushing with the help of gravity.  If you're wondering, yes, I gave birth while standing.  8 She sat in a birthing pool with her husband before standing up to deliver her daughter Credit: Courtesy Kimberly Gladden-Eversley  After sitting in a birthing pool for about thirty minutes, supported by my adoring husband, I could feel my contractions getting stronger.  My baby girl’s head was finally making its way further down the birth canal, and after months of research, I decided that gravity would offer me the best assistance.  As I got up, I could sense the hesitancy in the room, wondering if I’d finally gone mad or if my calm demeanor was a temporary act.  I saw random tremoring hands reaching out, ready to assist me from the birthing pool to the bed.  Without giving careful instruction, after I made my way to the bed, which felt like the longest walk ever, I crouched over, using the mattress as my support, and bore down, ready to push.  My midwife got on her knees, ready to catch my baby, and within minutes, her sweet cries filled the room, totaling my delivery time to over an hour and thirty minutes.  Shocked by my speedy delivery, my midwife jokingly informed her students that their short hour in the delivery room was not a typical day for a midwife.  8 'Who knew giving birth to my daughter would also deliver radiating confidence I never thought was possible?' she said Credit: Courtesy Kimberly Gladden-Eversley  The students, who were still speechless from the entire ordeal, managed to thank me for allowing them to bear witness to one of the most vulnerable moments of my life.  Honestly, I wanted to thank them for being there because I needed them more than they’d ever know.  Years of shouting body-positivity affirmations while staring at myself in the mirror, hoping no one would catch me seemingly talking to myself.  Or the times my friends and I would blast songs about women empowerment while singing like an audition for America’s Got Talent.  I probably wouldn’t have cared if Oprah decided to show up with a team of cameras for a feature on The Masterclass  None of it overpowered the hurling insults we’d hear about our bodies that “missed the mark.”  Overall, my level of comfort in my skin took a lot of emotional work and, apparently, physical pain during hours of labor in a crowded room.  Who knew giving birth to my daughter would also deliver radiating confidence I never thought was possible after years of listening to self-help audiobooks on laundry days?  I began to realize I was enough; in fact, I was more than enough to carry life for nine months, to nourish another body, and shockingly, my small breasts were enough to feed my baby for her entire first year of life.  8 Five students, Kimberly's husband, and her parents all watched her delivery Credit: Courtesy Kimberly Gladden-Eversley  Since then, I’ve embodied a sense of unfathomable bravery and was proud of my body from all angles.  I spent less time editing photos, less time working on my pose, and retired my filter button, vowing never to look back.  Let’s face it — after three children, who has time for that anyway?  All the work we put into achieving the picture-perfect body feels like a full-time job that doesn’t pay much.  So, I quit and didn’t give a two-week notice or write a resignation letter.  I proudly shifted jobs for a fulfilling life as a wife, mother, content creator, and gateway for future generations.  Some may falsely assume that my sudden transformation was due to the intensity of birthing pain that can naturally lead to psychological disassociation.  But something happened that day, changing my life forever, which gave birth to my daughter and a version of me that I’ve always aspired to be.  8 Now she's expecting baby number five and said: 'I’ve decided to extend an invitation to my labor and delivery room once again' Credit: Courtesy Kimberly Gladden-Eversley  I was able to experience life beyond fear while remaining present and comfortable in my skin.  My past insecurities were let go with the clothing on the floor that once hid my false perception of beauty.  Fast forward to today, as I prepare for the birth of baby number five, I’ve decided to extend an invitation to my labor and delivery room once again.  Making a conscious decision without pain or requests from my current midwife.  Sure, I’m 30 pounds heavier than I was seven years ago, I’ve accumulated more stretch marks than I could count, and my breasts look like they’ve seen better days.  Nevertheless, I am in love with the body I was given; I’m mesmerized by all the things it can do, and you should too.  As we witness our modern-day sex icons melt away their plastic surgery and Botox, it’s time for us to melt away our debilitating insecurities.  So, in the words of Taylor Swift, shake it off, and let’s redefine beauty together.  I want nothing more than to share my newfound courage and hope it continues to spread like wildfire.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS83OTc4MzYxL2JvZHktcG9zaXRpdmUtbmF0dXJhbC1iaXJ0aC1zdG9yeS_SAVBodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGUtc3VuLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvNzk3ODM2MS9ib2R5LXBvc2l0aXZlLW5hdHVyYWwtYmlydGgtc3RvcnkvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"birth","2018-12-05","Not Discerned","{""CapeTown"", ""WesternCape"", ""SouthAfrica""}","Tue 16 May 2023 08:22:56","Every two seconds, a baby is born too soon. Every 40 seconds, one of those babies dies. In the last decade, preterm birth rates have not changed in any region of the world. Coverage is highly inequitable and challenges disproportionately affect those most vulnerable. For example, nearly 1 in 10 preterm babies are born in the 10 most fragile countries affected by humanitarian crises where accessing care is particularly challenging.  A new report – Born Too Soon: Decade of Action on preterm birth – has highlighted that while encouraging progress has been made to prevent and protect preterm birth, much more concerted action is needed. Published at the International Maternal Newborn Health Conference (IMNHC) in Cape Town, South Africa, Born too soon sounds the alarm on the silent emergency of preterm birth, long under-recognised in its scale and severity, which is impeding progress in improving children’s health and survival.  The report has been produced by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) together with PMNCH – the world’s largest alliance for women, children and adolescents.  A pledge from leaders in women’s health and rights  As a member of the PMNCH Health-Care Professional Associations (HCPA) constituency, FIGO has come together with the Council of International Neonatal Nurses (COINN), International Confederation of Midwives (ICM), International Council of Nurses (ICN) and International Paediatric Association (IPA) have issued a joint statement to wholeheartedly commit to work together to take bold action to reduce the burden of preterm birth in the coming decade.  On the urgent need for collaborative action, Director of FIGO’s Division of Maternal and Newborn Health Professor Bo Jacobsson, said:  The inequities in coverage and quality of health services for women around the world are hindering progress towards the prevention of preterm births and stillbirths. Health care professionals have a key role to play as part of multi-stakeholder efforts to scale-up proven tools and resources aimed at the prevention of preterm birth, and to ensure women and families receive high quality, respectful and person-centred care.  FIGO and our partners re-affirm our commitment that all women and families receive respectful, person-centred care, and that women’s and adolescents’ voices are respected. Through the joint statement, we call upon our governments to support us in this critical work and invest in strengthening the health workforce so that skilled health care providers are comprehensively available to be able to ensure respectful high quality care reaches every mother and family  Partnership and people power  A decade on from the 2012 Born Too Soon report, more than 70 organisations have come together to develop an updated report. The report has been developed by more than 140 individuals from 46 countries, spanning national governments, civil society, including parents’ groups, health-care professional associations, young people, academic and research organisations, multilateral organisations, donors and foundations, and the private sector. Parents and families have shared their deeply personal experiences of preterm birth; a moving reminder that behind every statistic is a story of a family and a community deeply impacted, often for a lifetime.  The 2023 report is a testament to the power of partnership. Together, we are united in our call for a healthier and more equitable future for millions of babies, women and families.  Ensuring quality care for these tiniest, most vulnerable babies and their families is absolutely imperative for improving child health and survival. Progress is also needed to help prevent preterm births – this means every woman must be able to access quality health services before and during pregnancy to identify and manage risks. – Dr Anshu Banerjee, Director for Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health and Ageing, WHO  To make progress on maternal and newborn health, we must address preterm birth. Please share the report widely with your networks, partners, colleagues and friends. Together, we have all the ingredients for success.  More about the report  The report includes updated estimates from WHO and UNICEF, prepared with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, on the prevalence of preterm births. Overall, it finds that preterm birth rates have not changed in any region in the world in the past decade, with 152 million vulnerable babies born too soon from 2010 to 2020.  Image  Preterm birth is now the leading cause of child deaths, accounting for more than 1 in 5 of all deaths of children occurring before their 5th birthday. Preterm survivors can face lifelong health consequences, with an increased likelihood of disability and developmental delays.  The report notes that only 1 in 10 extremely preterm babies (<28 weeks) survive in low-income countries, compared to more than 9 in 10 in high-income countries. Gaping inequalities related to race, ethnicity, income, and access to quality care determine the likelihood of preterm birth, death, and disability, even in high-income countries.  Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa have the highest rates of preterm birth, and preterm babies in these regions face the highest mortality risk. Together, these two regions account for more than 65% of preterm births globally. The report also highlights that the impacts of conflict, climate change and environmental damage, COVID-19, and rising living costs are increasing risks for women and babies everywhere. For example, air pollution is estimated to contribute to 6 million preterm births each year. Nearly 1 in 10 preterm babies are born in the 10 most fragile countries affected by humanitarian crises, according to a new analysis in the report.  Maternal health risks, such as adolescent pregnancy and pre-eclampsia, are closely linked to preterm births.

The Canadian singer said he came to the decision while working on his new show, ""The Idol,"" a drama series he co-created and stars in. The series, which co-stars Lily-Rose Depp as a pop star named Jocelyn, premieres on HBO on June 4.  While bringing his character Tedros to life for a scene filmed at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles last fall, the ""Die For You"" singer said he had trouble oscillating between himself and the role. Tedros is described in a synopsis as ""a self-help guru and leader of a modern day cult.""  “I had to take off The Weeknd outfit, put on Tedros’ wig, shoot with Jocelyn, then go back to being The Weeknd,” he recalled to W. “It was tough to go from one head to another.""  The singer said the peak of how jarring the experience was for him was when he lost his voice after filming the scene, which was shot during an actual Weeknd concert.  ""Then, after the concert, I lost my voice,"" he said. ""No voice came out at all. That’s never happened before.""  ""My theory is that I forgot how to sing because I was playing Tedros, a character who doesn’t know how to sing,"" he said. ""I may be looking too deeply into this, but it was terrifying.""  He said the experience prompted deep introspection. In September, The Weeknd cancelled the second show of a two-night run in Los Angeles after he lost his voice, NBC News reported at the time.

"birth","2022-01-01","20:00:00","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 21:08:06","Crying baby at Japanese festival  Falling birth rates are a major concern for some of Asia's biggest economies.  Governments in the region are spending hundreds of billions of dollars trying to reverse the trend. Will it work?  Japan began introducing policies to encourage couples to have more children in the 1990s. South Korea started doing the same in the 2000s, while Singapore's first fertility policy dates back to 1987.  China, which has seen its population fall for the first time on 60 years, recently joined the growing club.  While it is difficult to quantify exactly how much these policies have cost, South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol recently said his country had spent more than $200bn (£160bn) over the past 16 years on trying to boost the population.  Yet last year South Korea broke its own record for the world's lowest fertility rate, with the average number of babies expected per woman falling to 0.78.  In neighbouring Japan, which had record low births of fewer than 800,000 last year, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has pledged to double the budget for child-related policies from 10tn yen ($74.7bn; £59.2bn), which is just over 2% of the country's gross domestic product.  Globally, while there are more countries that are trying to lower birth rates, the number of countries wanting to increase fertility has more than tripled since 1976, according to the most recent report by the United Nations.  China ditched its one-child policy in 2016  So why do these governments want to grow their populations?  Simply put, having a bigger population who can work and produce more goods and services leads to higher economic growth. And while a larger population can mean higher costs for governments, it can also result in bigger tax revenues.  Also, many Asian countries are ageing rapidly. Japan leads the pack with nearly 30% of its population now over the age of 65 and some other nations in the region are not far behind.  Compare that with India, which has just overtaken China as the world's most populous nation. More than a quarter of its people are between the age of 10 and 20, which gives its economy huge potential for growth.  Story continues  And when the share of the working age population gets smaller, the cost and burden of looking after the non-working population grow.  ""Negative population growth has an impact on the economy, and combined that with an ageing population, they won't be able to afford to support the elderly,"" said Xiujian Peng of Victoria University.  Graphic showing China's birthrate per 1,000 people, from 1978 to 2022. There has been a steady decline in recent years. The figure in 1978 was 18.25, while it was 6.77 in 2022.  Most of the measures across the region to increase birth rates have been similar: payments for new parents, subsidised or free education, extra nurseries, tax incentives and expanded parental leave.  But do these measures work?  Data for last few decades from Japan, South Korea and Singapore shows that attempts to boost their populations have had very little impact. Japan's finance ministry has published a study which said the policies were a failure.  It is a view echoed by the United Nations.  ""We know from history that the types of policies which we call demographic engineering where they try to incentivise women to have more babies, they just don't work,"" Alanna Armitage of United Nations Population Fund told the BBC.  ""We need to understand the underlying determinants of why women are not having children, and that is often the inability of women to be able to combine their work life with their family life,"" she added.  But in Scandinavian countries, fertility policies have worked better than they did in Asia, according to Ms Peng.  ""The main reason is because they have a good welfare system and the cost of raising children is cheaper. Their gender equality is also much more balanced than in Asian countries.""  Asian countries have ranked lower in comparison in the global gender gap report by the World Economic Forum.  Japan has the highest debt in the G7  There are also major questions over how these expensive measures should be funded, especially in Japan, which is the world's most indebted developed economy.  Options under consideration in Japan include selling more government bonds, which means increasing its debt, raising its sales tax or increasing social insurance premiums.  The first option adds financial burden to the future generations, while the other two would hit already struggling workers, which could convince them to have fewer children.  But Antonio Fatás, professor of economics at INSEAD says regardless of whether these policies work, they have to invest in them.  ""Fertility rates have not increased but what if there was less support? Maybe they would be even lower,"" he said.  Governments are also investing in other areas to prepare their economies for shrinking populations.  ""China has been investing in technologies and innovations to make up for the declining labour force in order to mitigate the negative impact of the shrinking population,"" said Ms Peng.  Also, while it remains unpopular in countries like Japan and South Korea, lawmakers are discussing changing their immigration rules to try to entice younger workers from overseas.  ""Globally, the fertility rate is falling so it'll be a race to attract young people to come and work in your country,"" Ms Peng added.  Whether the money is well spent on fertility policies, these governments appear to have no other choice.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vY2Euc3BvcnRzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FzaWEtc3BlbmRpbmctYmlnLWJhdHRsZS1sb3ctMjEwODA2OTY4Lmh0bWzSAVRodHRwczovL2NhLnNwb3J0cy55YWhvby5jb20vYW1waHRtbC9uZXdzL2FzaWEtc3BlbmRpbmctYmlnLWJhdHRsZS1sb3ctMjEwODA2OTY4Lmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The critically endangered pups were born on April 28, 2023, and are the offspring of four-year-old Gloria and three-year-old Oak, both first-time parents.  The nine pups – eight females and one male – are all healthy and doing well. The Nature Center’s veterinary care team carefully monitors the newborns during these critical first weeks. At just two weeks old, these pups are still wholly dependent on their parents, but Gloria and Oak have been seen moving them around the habitat, so guests may sporadically see them. The pups may begin venturing out of the den box around the end of May, and guests may begin to see the pups in the red wolf habitat in June. The WNC Nature Center’s social media channels will share updates on the progress of the pups.  Background:  Parents Gloria and Oak were paired in January 2023 based on a breeding recommendation from the Red Wolf SAFE (Saving Animals From Extinction) program of the Association of Zoos & Aquariums. SAFE is a collaborative effort between zoos and other conservation organizations to protect and recover the red wolf population through habitat restoration, genetically diverse breeding, and reintroducing red wolves into their natural habitat. Gloria was born in April 2019 at the Endangered Wolf Center in Missouri and Oak was born at the NC Zoo in Asheboro in April 2020.  By participating in this program, the WNC Nature Center is making a significant contribution to the conservation of this critically endangered species. “The WNC Nature Center is honored to be a part of the American red wolf conservation effort,” said WNC Nature Center Director Chris Gentile, “and we are so proud of Gloria and Oak for playing such an essential role in helping their species recover.”  American red wolves are native to North America and are one of the most endangered canine species in the world. In April 2023, the US Fish & Wildlife Service estimated that there are only 15 to 17 red wolves living in the wild in Eastern North Carolina. Red wolves in the SAFE program under human care numbered 235. The WNC Nature Center has been part of the American Red Wolf Recovery Program since 1990. Between 1996 and 2014, 13 pups were born at the Nature Center. This year’s litter brings that total to 22.  Community support:  Community members and supporters of red wolf conservation also have a role to play. With a pack of 11 red wolves at the WNC Nature Center, the community can help support a local effort to save these critically endangered animals. Donations can be made online at www.wildwnc.org/donate or mailed to Friends of the WNC Nature Center, PO Box 19151, Asheville, NC, 28815.  The WNC Nature Center connects people of all ages with the plants and animals of the Southern Appalachian Mountains.

Grady gave birth to five daughters. The first two were born in a hospital, but then she had a change of heart.  “There had been no trauma at the hospital births, and I have no idea where this thought originated, but I wanted to have the next baby at my friend’s home,” said Grady and laughed. “I had to look up 'Midwives' in the Yellow Pages.

Read, see, and hear exclusive commentary, stunning photography,…  All California midwives must be licensed with the California Medical Board to practice. Grady got her education at the National Midwifery Institute and is a Licensed Midwife (LM) with a national certification as a Certified Professional Midwife (CPM).  Grady runs the facility alongside the center’s executive director, husband Darren Grady. Also on the team is colleague Deborah (Fawn) Studebaker, LM, CPM. The center partners with midwife assistants and students, a lactation consultant, pregnancy and childbirth educators and consultant OB/GYN doctors.  The Napa center is located at 525 Lincoln Ave. and the Santa Rosa center (formerly Thrive Center for Birth and Family Wellness) is at 4859 Old Redwood Highway (themidwives.com). Should the need arise, they also work with nearby hospitals.  Natural childbirth is a vaginal birth involving no medical interventions such as forceps, vacuums, or epidurals. Medically trained professionals such as licensed midwives and doulas are available to assist with natural childbirth, whether the birth itself takes place in a hospital, stand-alone birthing center, or at home.  The American Association of Birth Centers describes birth centers as “a safe, alternative, choice 'in-between' home and hospital; a facility designed to support natural labor and delivery, supported by highly trained midwives and skilled staff, offering a family-centered, relaxed, calm, non-institutional experience.”  The Napa Valley and Sonoma Valley Birth Centers offer pre-natal care and childbirth attendance, along with emergency equipment and supplies if needed, and postpartum visits. The birth centers can also assist with home births, water births and doulas.  “There is a difference between midwives and doulas,” said Paula Grady. “A doula provides emotional and physical care, and postpartum support for the mother. As licensed midwives, we can provide medical care, order lab work such as ultrasound, and make medical decisions. Doulas don't provide medical care.”  Grady said that during natural birth, 99% of the mothers opt for using a birth tub, at least for part of the process. “I’d say that 75- 80% experience water births.” The birth centers have tubs available.  According to the Peterson-Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) Health System Tracker, hospital childbirth costs an average of $18,865 nationwide, which includes pregnancy, delivery and postpartum care. The International Federation of Health Plans says our state is higher, “California is particularly expensive… with hospitals there charging an average of $26,380 for mothers to give birth to their child.”  The cost for the Midwives Childbirth Services is $7,500, with discount options and payment plans. Most insurance PPO plans cover at least part of birth center childbirths, HMOs may not.  The midwives said that the best candidates for a natural birth are “normal, healthy moms with normal, healthy babies.”  “Mothers feel safe and comfortable with us,” said Paula Grady. “They know the birth team will take good care of them. It’s an emotional, mental event and a big transformation.”  Studebaker added that natural childbirth is an excellent option for first-time mothers. “I’d say it’s better for first-time moms; in fact, it’s vital.”  Prior to the opening of the Sonoma Valley Birth Center, Rhiannon Sanders of Guerneville had her first child in February. She chose Paula and the Napa Valley Birth Center for the delivery.  “Early in my pregnancy, I didn’t know what the experience would be like,” said Sanders. “I went to an OB/GYN thinking they’d give me an education; information about what I should be eating and so on. I got none of that. As soon as I met Paula, though, she gave me a large booklet on what I could expect week by week. By then, I was far along at 35 weeks.”  “Originally, I thought I’d give birth at home, but when I saw the Napa Valley Birth Center, it looked as pleasant and comfortable as my own home. Since I live over an hour and a half away, I was concerned about the drive while in labor. Paula said I could come during early labor and just hang out. That reassured me. I think for first-time moms, the birth center is a happy medium between a hospital and home birth. It’s great to have all the resources right there.”  Darren Grady summed up what was important for people who want to have a natural birth. “With the recent closing of several hospital Labor and Delivery departments, North Bay mamas do have alternatives to a hospital birth,” he said in an email. “A stand-alone birth center is becoming even more viable as a safe, supportive setting for pregnancy and childbirth. Paula and the midwives can provide midwifery care and a natural birth experience at the Napa Valley Birth Center in Napa or the Sonoma Valley Birth Center in Santa Rosa.”  Photos: Take a look inside the Napa Valley Birth Center","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL25hcGF2YWxsZXlyZWdpc3Rlci5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvbmFwYS12YWxsZXktYmlydGgtY2VudGVyLWFkZHMtbmV3LWZhY2lsaXR5L2FydGljbGVfYTNmOWRiNGMtZjAyOC0xMWVkLWI4OTUtOGZlOTc1ZjM4NTEwLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Share Copy Link Copy  Hide Transcript Show Transcript  ANNIVERSARY OF THE MAY 20TH TORNADO THAT DEVASTATED MOORE AND SURROUNDING AREAS, WE’RE TAKING A LOOK BACK AT SOME OF THOSE IMPACTED BY THAT DAY. OKAY. WE’RE TALKING ABOUT JUST WEST OF I-35. THIS IS GOING TO BE ESPECIALLY JUST RIGHT AROUND THE WARREN THEATER, THE MOORE MEDICAL CENTER, ROYAL PARK, MOORE. THIS IS ALL ON THE WEST SIDE OF I-35. YOU ARE IN THE PATH OF THIS TORNADO. SO I THINK THE MORE MEDICAL CENTER LOOKING DIRECTLY INTO THIS AND WHILE THAT DAY IN 2013 WAS FILLED WITH SO MUCH TRAGEDY AND DESTRUCTION FOR AT LEAST ONE FAMILY, A MIRACLE TOOK PLACE. AMONG THAT CHAOS, KOCO ZACH RAEL SPOKE WITH SHAYLA TAYLOR. SHE WAS IN LABOR AS THE TORNADO BARRELED DOWN ON MOORE MEDICAL CENTER. HE HAS AN UPDATE TODAY ON HER SON AND HOW THAT FATEFUL DAY HAS COME FULL CIRCLE A DECADE LATER. LOOKING BACK TEN YEARS LATER, SHAYLA TAYLOR SAYS STORMS, ESPECIALLY TORNADOES, WERE THE LAST THING ON HER MIND AS SHE STARTED HER DAY ON MAY 20TH, 2013. THAT’S BECAUSE TAYLOR WAS SCHEDULED TO BE INDUCED TO GIVE BIRTH TO HER SECOND SON. THAT AFTERNOON. SEVERE WEATHER, TORNADOES, NOTHING LIKE THAT WAS ON MY MIND AT ALL, WAS GO IN, HAVE A BABY, GO HOME. AND THAT’S THE END OF IT. AS IT TURNED OUT, HER DELIVERY WAS ANYTHING BUT THAT SIMPLE. AS SHE GOT TO MOORE MEDICAL CENTER, HER DOCTORS AND NURSES KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ON THE WEATHER FORECASTS. AS IT WAS PREDICTED, STRONG STORMS COULD BE FORMING THAT AFTERNOON WHEN I GOT THERE, THE DOCTOR TOLD ME THAT SHE WAS GOING TO CHECK THE WEATHER AND SEE IF I WAS ACTUALLY IN ACTIVE LABOR OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE THERE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE BAD WEATHER THAT DAY. WHATEVER THE WEATHER, THE BABY WAS WELL ON ITS WAY. AND TAYLOR WAS GIVEN AN EPIDURAL, WHICH MEANS THAT SHE CAN NO LONGER MOVE HERSELF FREELY. SHORTLY AFTER, THAT’S WHEN THINGS OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL TOOK A TURN FOR THE WORST. A TORNADO EMERGENCY WAS ISSUED AROUND MAYBE TWO OR SO. THEY COME IN AND SAY THAT WE’RE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE COVER AND MY FAMILY IS GOING TO HAVE TO GO DOWNSTAIRS TO THE CAFETERIA. I CAN’T GO ANYWHERE BECAUSE, LIKE I SAID, I CAN’T GET OUT OF BED. A RARE F5 TORNADO WAS HEADING RIGHT TOWARDS MOORE MEDICAL CENTER. DOCTORS AND NURSES RUSHING TO GET TAYLOR TO A SAFE SPOT. THEY DECIDE THEY’RE GOING TO HAVE TO MOVE ME TO THE PLACE WHERE THERE’S NO WINDOWS AS CLOSE AWAY FROM THE OUTSIDE OF THE BUILDING AS THEY CAN, WHICH ENDED UP BEING THE OR JUST MINUTES LATER, THAT MASSIVE TORNADO HIT THE HOSPITAL HEAD ON, DESTROYING THE BUILDING AROUND HER. A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THAT, YOU HEAR LIKE A SILENCE OR LIKE A TRAIN OR WHATEVER WHEN TORNADOES COME THROUGH. BUT IT WAS MORE OF A SILENT THING, LIKE YOU DIDN’T REALLY HEAR ANYTHING. YOU JUST SAW EVERYTHING KIND OF FALLING AROUND YOU. THIS IS A PHOTO OF WHAT WAS LEFT OF THE O.R. WHERE TAYLOR WAS HUNKERED DOWN. YOU CAN SEE THE DEBRIS AND DESTRUCTION ALL AROUND WHEN IT WAS ACTUALLY HITTING WAS WHEN I WAS THE MOST SCARED. TAYLOR AND HER FAMILY SURVIVED. BUT EVEN WITH THE DESTRUCTION AROUND THEM, THAT DIDN’T CHANGE THE FACT THAT SHE WAS GOING TO GIVE BIRTH VERY SOON. SHE NEEDED TO GET TO SAFETY. THAT WAS A TASK IN ITSELF BECAUSE I’M UPSTAIRS AND I SAID ALL THE HALLWAYS ARE DARK. EVEN WHEN THEY CARRIED ME DOWN ON THE BACKBOARD, IT WAS DARK GOING DOWN THE STAIRS. YOU KNOW, YOU’RE JUST KIND OF LOOKING AROUND. YOU CAN’T REALLY SEE MUCH OF ANYTHING. SO THE FIRST LIGHT I ACTUALLY SAW WAS ONCE WE GOT OUTSIDE OF THE HOSPITAL, ONCE SHE WAS OUTSIDE, TAYLOR SAYS, SHE STARTED TO REALIZE THE TRUE MAGNITUDE OF THE STORM. IT WAS MUDDY. THERE WAS THERE WERE TREES AND DEBRIS EVERYWHERE. THERE WERE CARS AND STUFF KIND OF EVERYWHERE. SO I KNEW THAT IT WAS PRETTY BAD. SHE WAS THEN RUSHED TO NORMAN REGIONAL HOSPITAL, WHERE SHE SUCCESSFULLY GAVE BIRTH AT 7:30 P.M. TO HER SECOND SON, BRADEN. HE WILL BE TEN AND HE HE’S DOING GOOD. HE’S IN FOURTH GRADE NOW. HE KNOWS A LOT ABOUT THE DAY HE WAS BORN. SO WE TALK ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME. A DECADE LATER. AND TAYLOR SAYS IT’S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT SO MUCH TIME HAS ALREADY PASSED. COMING UP ON TEN YEARS FEELS A LITTLE SURREAL, LIKE IT DOESN’T FEEL LIKE IT’S BEEN TEN YEARS SINCE THE TORNADO HAPPENED. OF COURSE, MY DAILY REMINDER IS MY CHILD, TAYLOR, USING HER UNIQUE DELIVERY EXPERIENCE TO HELP OTHERS SOON TO BE MOMS. TODAY, SHE’S NOW A NURSE AT THE VERY HOSPITAL WHERE SHE GAVE BIRTH AT NORMAN REGIONAL HOSPITAL. IT’S DEFINITELY COME FULL CIRCLE. I WORK IN LABOR AND DELIVERY, WHICH I ABSOLUTELY LOVE. IN FACT, SHE EVEN WORKS WITH THAT SAME DOCTOR WHO DELIVERED BRADEN. SHE DIDN’T REALIZE WHO I WAS FOR A WHILE BECAUSE I NEVER TOLD HER. AND THEN ONE DAY SHE JUST WALKS UP TO ME AND SHE’S LIKE, YOU’RE SHAYLA, AREN’T YOU? AND I WAS LIKE, YEAH. AND SO SHE STARTS SHOWING ME PICTURES THAT SHE HAD FROM THE HOSPITAL AND STUFF. AND SO WE JUST KIND OF SHARED OUR PICTURES AND I TOLD HER THANK YOU, EVEN THOUGH SO MANY PEOPLE LOST SO MUCH ON MAY 20TH, 2013, A GLIMMER OF HOPE AND A MIRACLE ALSO TOOK PLACE THAT DAY, SOMETHING TAYLOR SAYS SHE WILL NEVER TAKE FOR GRANTED.

I hate to use “Lynchian,” a term frequently — and slovenly — invoked for films with a merely surrealist bent. But Schaefer’s film, also steeped in a distinctly American nostalgia, more than deserves the description.  In this uncanny indie, we’re plunged into an American no-place, where a suburban father, Daryl (Paul Sparks), plans to open a diner despite not having any money; and where a former actress named Monica (Constance Shulman, channeling Norma Desmond in “Sunset Boulevard”) prepares for a big interview that will never happen. Opposite these tragic figures is Daryl’s wife, Diane (Annie Parisse), and Monica’s daughter Marlene (Gus Birney) — two women worn down by the follies of their loved ones.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTYvbW92aWVzL2dpdmluZy1iaXJ0aC10by1hLWJ1dHRlcmZseS1yZXZpZXcuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Then she asks if any of the students has ever seen a woman give birth. Most have not.  Curious about how cultural attitudes and expectations affect the physical experience of childbirth and its outcomes, Dr. Thayer began a study to assess the prevalence of tokophobia, the medical term for a pathological fear of childbirth.  Though tokophobia has been well studied in Scandinavian countries, some of which screen pregnant women and offer treatment for it, little research has been done in the United States. Dr. Thayer’s online survey of nearly 1,800 American women found that in the early days of the pandemic, tokophobia may have affected the majority of American women: 62 percent of pregnant respondents reported high levels of fear and worry about childbirth.  The results were published last month in the journal Evolution, Medicine, and Public Health.  Other scientists who study childbirth said the levels of fear in the United States were higher than those reported in Europe and Australia, which are lower than 20 percent. But they noted that birthing conditions in the United States are different and that pandemic circumstances may have exacerbated fears.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTYvaGVhbHRoL2NoaWxkYmlydGgtZmVhci13b21lbi5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

In addition to these findings, the reports recorded a net-gain in population to rural parts of the commonwealth through in-migration.  The reports, released by the Center for Rural Pennsylvania, a state legislative agency for rural policy, use data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Health, to better understand the commonwealth’s rural areas, including who is moving into — and out of — them.  In-Migration/Out-Migration  Data from the U.S. Census Bureau shows that in 2021, more than 144,900 people moved into rural Pennsylvania and approximately 123,300 moved out. This movement resulted in a net gain of approximately 21,600 new residents, down from 21,800 in 2019.  The report found that the majority of people (52%) moving to rural Pennsylvania, were from out-of-state.  In fact, more than 54% of the people moving to rural Pennsylvania came from neighboring states New York, New Jersey and Maryland.  Another 41% of the people who moved to rural areas of the commonwealth came from its urban areas, compared to 2019 when 38% came from urban Pennsylvania.  Lastly, 7% of the people who moved to rural Pennsylvania came from outside of the United States.  Of those who left rural Pennsylvania, 53% went to other states, compared to 61% in 2019.  Fifty-one percent of those moved to one of the following five states: Florida, New York, Maryland, North Carolina and South Carolina.  Additionally, 47% of those who moved out of rural Pennsylvania relocated to urban areas in 2021.  The report identified working adults and college students as the two largest demographic groups driving in-migration to rural areas of the commonwealth.  Working adults between the ages of 18 and 64 made up 40% of the people who moved out of rural Pennsylvania and 37% of those who moved into rural areas.  College students made up 22% of those who moved into rural Pennsylvania and 18% of those who moved out, according to the report.  Birth & Death Rates  From 2010 to 2020, deaths outnumbered births in rural Pennsylvania, accounting for the loss of nearly 85,000 residents.  Nationally, the birth rate from 2010 to 2020 was 12.13 per 1,000 residents, according to census data.  At 10.87 births per 1,000 residents, Pennsylvania had one of the nation’s lowest birth rates over the same time period with only eight states having lower birth rates.  In rural Pennsylvania, the birth rate was lower than the statewide rate at 9.17 births per 1,000 residents.  The report found that Wayne, Centre, Sullivan, Pike and Forest counties had the lowest birth rates with each having rates below 8 births per 1,000 residents.  ——  Pennsylvania Capital-Star is part of States Newsroom, a network of news bureaus supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

Every 2 seconds, a baby is born too soon. Every 40 seconds, one of those babies dies. In the last decade, preterm birth rates have not changed in any region of the world. Coverage is highly inequitable and challenges disproportionately affect those most vulnerable. For example, nearly 1 in 10 preterm babies are born in the 10 most fragile countries affected by humanitarian crises where accessing care is particularly challenging.

Kunal Sen believed his father would have adapted to the technological advancements to make low-budget films.    From ‘Mrigayaa’, ‘Calcutta 71’, ‘Kharij’, ‘Ek Din Pratidin’, to ‘Bhuvan Shome’, Sen, who gave birth to a new cinema movement in India, highlighted the middle-class lives in the city through most of his films.  However, as Anjan Dutt rightly pointed out, Sen’s films threw questions at the audience, actors and even himself. However, he never sought solutions.  Kolkata is celebrating the birth centenary of the master filmmaker. On Monday, an eight-day birth centenary celebration, titled ‘Sentenary’ kicked off at Gorky Sadan. Beginning Monday, (May 15), the celebrations which comprise exhibitions, talk shows and film screenings, will continue till May 22.  Madhabi Mukherjee, who stole our hearts forever with her performance in ‘Baishe Srabon’, Bangladesh filmmaker Tanvir Mokammel, Goutam Ghose, Mamata Shankar, Ashoke Viswanathan and Kunal were present at the inauguration at Gorky Sadan.  An exhibition of his photographs, posters, journals, books on and by Sen, letters and mementoes is on at Gorky Sadan for all film buffs from 3.30 pm to 5.30 pm, except May 17 and May 21.  The inauguration ceremony was followed by the screening of the documentary titled ‘With Mrinal Sen’ directed by Sanjay and Subrata Bhattacharya. For the next five days, his cult films like ‘Baishe Srabon’, ‘Matira Manisha’, ‘Oka Oori Katha’ and ‘Genesis’ would be screened along with adda sessions on the maestro.  “My father always made low-budget films. Today, technology has made huge advancements and I am sure, Bondhu (as he would call his father) would have adapted to this changing technology and made films within a restricted budget,” said Kunal, who has written a book, ‘Bondhu — My Father, My Friend?’ on the master filmmaker.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbGxlbm5pdW1wb3N0LmluL2JlbmdhbC9jZWxlYnJhdGluZy1iaXJ0aC1jZW50ZW5hcnktb2YtYXV0ZXVyLW1yaW5hbC1zZW4tZXhwby1vbi01MTg3NjLSAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5taWxsZW5uaXVtcG9zdC5pbi9hbXAvYmVuZ2FsL2NlbGVicmF0aW5nLWJpcnRoLWNlbnRlbmFyeS1vZi1hdXRldXItbXJpbmFsLXNlbi1leHBvLW9uLTUxODc2Mg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Little did she know, she was pregnant with her daughter Marley-Rae, who was born just six minutes after paramedics arrived.  'I said to (the paramedic), ''No I'm not (pregnant)'', and she said, ''Yes you are'',' Ms Wilson told Sunrise.  Ms Wilson could be heard wailing in agony in audio of the phone call she made to emergency services.  'The pain is coming right now, ugh!' she was heard crying out.  'Oh my God! I'm just sitting on the toilet because it feels like something's trying to come out but there's nothing there and it hurts!'  There was no time to rush to the hospital once paramedics arrived and Ms Wilson ended up giving birth to little Marley-Rae in her living room.  'I was in complete denial, I did not want to believe (the paramedic) at all,' she said.  'I was scared about what was happening to my body at the time and I was just in big denial.'  The 34-year-old had gone to her doctor complaining of a bloating issue but was bizarrely told just to drink more water and eat peanuts.  'Visually it was really hard to see, a lot of my family have been going through photos and saying ''even there you don't look pregnant'',' she said.  Ms Wilson admitted that because she had no idea she was pregnant, she was 'kind of in party mode'.  Ashlee Wilson, 34, from Banksia Grove, in Perth's north-east, was home alone last week when she rang triple zero complaining of severe stomach pains  'Of course there were things I was doing that I shouldn't have been doing that now I look back and think, ''Oh my God I'm so sorry if anything happens to you because of that'',' she added.  Both Ms Wilson and Marley-Rae are doing well one week on, with the mother saying the birth of her little girl is one of the best things that has ever happened to her.  'Here I was thinking I wanted to be an interstate truck driver a week-and-a-half-ago, now I want to give her the world and take it over with her,' she said.
