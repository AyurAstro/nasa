According to Henry, the 21-year-old chances of playing regularly for the Three Lions are slim considering the star-studded attack of the team.  Henry told CBS Sports, “I think it’s a great one [coup] because they [USA]are missing a number 9. Now for him it’s going to be important next season to play.  “We all know for the national team with England he had to battle with Callum Wilson, [Ivan] Toney, Ollie Watkins, Tammy Abraham, Harry Kane.  “He’s a great, great, great player for the US.”  Balogun was born in the States, but grew up in England and was also eligible to play for Nigeria."

On Wednesday night, local National Party delegates chose the 26-year-old Mount Maunganui communications executive as their electorate candidate, with Bay of Plenty MP Todd Muller retiring from politics.  Rutherford told the Bay of Plenty Times the selection experience was “really humbling”.  “The local party members have selected me and it’s [incredible] to have their support. I’m not going to let them down.”  “I feel really privileged. I’m really, really happy.”  Last week, horticulturalist and trust director Pare Taikato was selected as the Labour Party’s candidate for the Bay of Plenty seat after MP Angie Warren-Clark announced she was standing for election in Whangārei.  Rutherford most recently worked for Rotorua mayor Tania Tapsell, a former National Party East Coast candidate, at Rotorua Lakes Council.  Asked what he most wanted people to know him, Rutherford said “an empathetic and hard-working local MP who’s passionate for the Bay of Plenty and ensuring we have the best possible services”.  He would pick the baton up from Muller, who fought for key projects such as a 24/7 medical centre for Pāpāmoa.  Local transport such as the Takitimu North Link was also “really important to me”, Rutherford said.  Bay of Plenty MP Todd Muller. Photo / Mark Mitchell  “I’m going to be the strongest advocate for the electorate to ensure the transport projects we need are signed off.  “I’m going to be learning. I’m going to be listening, taking everything on board.”  Rutherford confirmed he lived in the electorate, and said he wanted people to feel they could reach out to him for support and advice.  He was one of four men shortlisted last year to become National’s Tauranga MP after Simon Bridges resigned.  The shortlist drew commentary at the time for its lack of diversity. Sam Uffindell was selected.  Rutherford said he would “stick up for every community member that calls this place home”.  “I’m going to be getting out and about to listen to people and understand the issues that [they have].  Rutherford said that included the cost of living crisis.  “Families are wondering where they are going to fund hundreds of dollars a week to pay the mortgage. That’s before we get to paying groceries.”  He named former Bay of Plenty MP and Minister of Health Tony Ryall, who retired in 2014 after 24 years in Parliament, as the New Zealand politician he was most inspired by.  Muller followed Ryall in the seat, which has been held by National since it was re-established in 1996, and for several decades in its previous iteration.  Muller announced in March this year he would not seek re-election, telling the Bay of Plenty Times at the time there wasn’t enough fire in the belly to continue.  It followed a rollercoaster few years that saw him spearhead a coup against Simon Bridges and lead National for 53 days before a mental health breakdown forced him out of the role, get demoted under Judith Collins’ leadership, resign, then change his mind when Christopher Luxon became leader.  Rutherford paid tribute to Muller and said he was looking forward to the chance of taking on his role as MP.  “You need to be prepared to stand up and fight for your community and bring their issues to the fore and get an electorate the things they deserve,” Rutherford said.  “I’ve got the skills to be the best possible advocate for the Bay of Plenty.  “I will earn the right to be MP.”  - Additional reporting Luke Kirkness"

Many of their peers had expected surging interest rates—up 5% points in just over a year—would've put a more material dent in hiring and personal consumption by now. Instead, the unemployment rate is hovering at a more-than-five-decade low, consumers are still spending, and the housing market is beginning to stabilise.  At the same time, inflation has slowed appreciably. That combination is reviving hopes among the true believers, including Fed Chair Jerome Powell, for a ""soft landing"" scenario in which price pressures dissipate without massive job losses or an economic downturn.  It's still an out-of-consensus call. Of the 27 forecasters surveyed by Bloomberg in early May, only five said they didn't expect the US economy to slip into a recession sometime over the next year. Still, the starting point keeps getting pushed back, as a robust labour market keeps wage growth elevated and excess savings accumulated during the pandemic continue to boost the spending power of American households.  ""We all hate that term, 'This time is different,' but we have not seen this dynamic before,"" says Ellen Zentner, chief US economist for Morgan Stanley. ""This is unique.""  Zentner, one of the few optimists on Wall Street, is quick to point out the headwinds facing an economy she describes as ""flying dangerously low to the ground."" The failure of several regional lenders that buckled under the weight of soaring interest rates continues to reverberate, and data revisions—especially to jobs numbers—could yet change the outlook.  That's similar to the message Powell offered reporters earlier this month, after the central bank raised its benchmark rate above 5% for the first time since 2007. ""It's possible that this time is really different,"" he said. But he also said, ""There are no promises in this.""  Lately, the data support the optimists.  Hiring picked up in April, pushing the unemployment rate down to 3.4%. Labour force participation, too, has been rising—especially among the cohort age 25 to 54 that economists like to refer to as ""prime working age."" It hit a 15-year high last month, alleviating some of the supply-side constraints that have been plaguing the labour market, while a falling number of job openings points to a gradual cooling in demand for workers.  Moreover, auto sales surged in April to the highest level in almost two years, suggesting consumers are still more than willing to buy big-ticket items as supply-chain issues ease. Retail sales more broadly posted gains last month, and factory production picked up.  And on the inflation front, services prices excluding energy and housing rose in April at the slowest pace in nine months. Given that Fed officials have been particularly worried about pressures in that part of the economy, the moderation in that metric reduces the chances of additional rate hikes.  David Mericle, the chief US economist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., is another among the few who've stuck to a no-recession call. It's been a lonely ride, but it's starting pay off, he says.  ""We did a lot of good research and came up with a lot of non-obvious things that people missed that informed that view,"" Mericle says. ""We were on the optimistic end of this debate, and in some respects things have gone even better than I would have dreamed.""  The vast majority of forecasters still see a recession as highly likely. But the recent run of good data is causing some to rethink the timing.  Wells Fargo & Co economists said last week that they now expect the recession to start in the fourth quarter of this year, instead of the third quarter. Jean-François Perrault, Scotiabank's chief economist, says that while his team expects the economy to fall into recession in the current quarter, they ""may be pushing that out"" to the third quarter in the next forecast. Kathy Bostjancic at Nationwide, who sees a recession beginning in the third quarter, says continued resilience in the labour market could delay the start to later in the year.  ""The consensus forecast for at least a year running has been that we're three months away from a recession, and it just keeps getting pushed back and pushed back and pushed back,"" says Stephen Stanley, the chief US economist at Santander US Capital Markets LLC. ""A big part of the reason is that consumer spending continues to grow.""  While a tight labour market remains a key support to spending, momentum is beginning to cool. And household balance sheets—while still padded by savings accumulated in the early part of the pandemic—are starting to show early signs of strain. This could make next year more ""touch and go,"" Stanley says, as the full weight of the Fed's tightening hits the economy.  He and Sarah House, a senior economist at Wells Fargo, also warned about the flip side of resilient consumer spending: It might keep inflation too high for the Fed's liking. ""Ultimately, we'll need to see a pullback in demand to get inflation under control, making a recession still seem fairly inevitable,"" House says.  A third view is that the economy is experiencing a ""rolling recession,"" a term Ed Yardeni says he first used in the 1980s when Texas was hit hard by an oil slump but the rest of the country held up. It's a similar picture today with pockets of pain—merchandise trade has been under pressure, and commercial real estate is teetering—but aggregate growth figures are unlikely to show a technical recession, according to Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research Inc.  ""That's the story so far, and that's my ongoing forecast,"" he says.  While the final judgment on the post-pandemic business cycle may not be written for years to come, views will probably continue to morph as new data accumulate and expectations change.  ""The recession narrative has been a somewhat inconsistent one over time,"" says Goldman's Mericle. ""I think we are on to Version 3 at this point.""

Johnson has revitalised his career since rejoining the Warriors last year but he’s off contract at the end of this season and is currently free to sign with a rival club.  The veteran playmaker met with the Tigers last week where they tabled a two-year deal from 2024 worth $650,000 per season.

Sources told TheMarker, the business newspaper in Haaretz's Hebrew edition, that the job was done by a paid “kashrut supervisor.” Kashrut normally refers to adherence to Jewish dietary laws.  Executives at the chain, Be, said the move was the result of pressure at one store by local rabbis, who threatened to call a boycott on the branch in the town of Bnei Brak.  More stickers at the branch.  The move marks the latest effort by some segments of the ultra-Orthodox community to cover images of women's faces in a bid to decrease contact between the sexes.  The executives said they were frustrated by the demand but had to comply. “Do you want us not to open stores in ultra-Orthodox cities?” one executive asked. “Or should we resist the residents’ demands and have them protesting in front of our stores all day?”  Photos of the purple stickers went viral on Tuesday; a resident of a nearby town who was shopping at the branch was the first to upload a picture. The purple on the stickers is the same color the chain uses in its marketing.  The effort caused a stir Tuesday, though a tweet posted nearly three years ago also shows stickers covering women’s faces.  The woman who uploaded the first photo Tuesday, whose first name is Galit, said she wanted to avoid an altercation so she did not talk to anyone in the store.  A post lampooning the move by referring to the declaring of Israel's independence in 1948.  “Anyway, what would they say?” Galit said. “But I think it’s crazy. What are they thinking – that a man is aroused by a woman's face? And what’s the message they're sending to girls who come to the store? That they should cover their faces?”  The women's group Bonot Alternativa has launched an online campaign against the pharmacy's actions.  “When we started with 'The Handmaid’s Tale' performances, we never imagined that women would be hidden in the public sphere so soon and so blatantly. Our warnings are already becoming a reality,” said Moran Zer Katzenstein, who founded Bonot Alternativa.  Be is owned by Shufersal, Israel's largest supermarket chain.  “Shufersal’s conscious decision to act as it did reinforces the tangible danger of unfathomable extremism and distortion, and paves the way for even more via the judicial coup,” Zer Katzenstein added, referring to the hard-right government's attempt to weaken the judicial system.  The pharmacy chain added: “We respect all segments of the Israeli population. The picture at issue was taken at a store in Bnei Brak serving the ultra-Orthodox community. Please note that this involves only that store.”"

That’s Thailand’s “lese majeste” law that can put offenders in jail for as many as 15 years if convicted of royal insults.  “This is Bhumjaithai’s core principle that cannot be changed or negotiated,” the party said in a statement posted on Facebook. “Bhumjaithai cannot vote for a prime minister candidate of a party that has a proposal to amend or abolish Article 112.”  The issue is proving to be a roadblock in Move Forward’s bid to form a government after it stunned the nation by winning Sunday’s parliamentary election. Earlier this week, Thaksin Shinawatra also sought to distance his family from the push of Pita’s party to “lese majeste” even as Pheu Thai party which the former premier backs had agreed to join hands with Move Forward.  The 42-year-old Harvard-educated Pita is seeking 376 votes in the lower house to bypass the military-appointed senate for him to become Thailand’s 30th premier. The coalition said it has secured about 310 seats so far, which means the 70 held by Bhumjaithai could prove pivotal.  Anutin Charnvirakul, the leader and prime minister candidate of Bhumjaithai, played kingmaker after the 2019 election before eventually siding with the military-backed Palang Pracharath and securing ministry positions for his party.  Story continues  The decision of Anutin’s party not to back Pita for prime minister means Move Forward will now need to look to pro-royalist senators and the conservative Democrat Party for support after previously ruling out any alliance with military backed groups.  The push to directly change laws affecting the monarchy breaks a longstanding taboo in Thailand, where in years past, even the suggestion of disloyalty to the palace had been grounds for the military to stage a coup.  Move Forward vowed to press ahead with the reform after the election. Pita has since said preliminary talks about government formation are going well and the bloc will hold a briefing Thursday in Bangkok to reveal details about a memorandum of understanding between the parties.  --With assistance from Suttinee Yuvejwattana.

Authorities are holding women and girls in incommunicado detention, sometimes for years, partly in an attempt to obtain information on male relatives suspected of links to Sinai Province, the local branch of the Islamic State group.  Many of the women were themselves victims of abuse at the hands of militants, according to the report by Human Rights Watch and the Sinai Foundation for Human Rights (SFHR).  “Egyptian authorities have been abusing many women and children in North Sinai to extract information about their suspected ISIS affiliate relatives or pressure these suspects to turn themselves in,” said Ahmed Salem, executive director of the Sinai Foundation, using a different acronym for IS.  “The authorities should immediately free all women and girls held merely for being related to or associated with male suspects, and investigate torture and other ill-treatment against them.”  Stay informed with MEE's newsletters Sign up to get the latest alerts, insights and analysis, starting with Turkey Unpacked  The rights groups documented cases involving 19 women and two girls between 2017 and 2022, interviewing relatives, lawyers, and current and former female detainees.  Relatives of three detainees said Egyptian authorities beat and used electric shocks on the women, while others were slapped, blindfolded and verbally abused.  Several of the women were abused by Sinai Province militants, including being raped and forced into marriage, sources said. But in all cases reviewed by the rights groups, detainees were not treated as potential victims of crime by Egyptian authorities.  In six cases, security forces detained women and girls who had escaped the IS-affiliated group and sought protection via state authorities. Several of them were charged with joining and providing logistical support to a terrorist group.  'Intolerable abuses'  “Many women and girls in North Sinai have already suffered intolerable abuse at the hands of ISIS-linked members,” said Adam Coogle, deputy Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch.  “The Egyptian government should be protecting them, not locking them up and torturing them.”  The rights groups called on Egypt's international partners to urge authorities to end security forces' abuses, and on the United Nations to address deteriorating human rights in the country.  'The Egyptian government should be protecting [women and girls], not locking them up and torturing them' - Adam Coogle, HRW  Egypt declared war on IS following the military coup led by President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, when the former army general ousted his democratically elected civilian predecessor, Mohamed Morsi.  Years of military operations in North Sinai between the Egyptian armed forces and the local branch of the Islamic State group have taken a heavy toll on civilians and soldiers.  Human Rights Watch believes that over 100,000 of the region’s 450,000 residents have been displaced or have left the region since 2013.  Death tolls in the conflict are not publicly available, but according to a count compiled by independent researchers who maintain anonymity for their safety, more than 1,500 military personnel were killed between 2011 and June 2018.  Middle East Eye reported last month that the Egyptian army “unnecessarily"" destroyed schools in the Sinai Peninsula in its war against militants, forcing a generation of pupils out of school.

In December, Universal announced a new interactive attraction, llumination's Villain-Con Minion Blast, would be joining the already popular Despicable Me Minion Mayhem attraction as part of a new Minion Land.  “As soon as guests enter the land, they’ll be greeted by a fun, photo-worthy ‘Minion Land’ marquee featuring 22 Minions before embarking on the mischief that awaits along Illumination Ave.,” the resort revealed Tuesday along with fresh details about the upcoming Minion Cafe, several themed eateries and new meet-and-greet opportunities featuring Illuminations characters.  Here’s what guests can expect when Minion Land opens at Universal Studios Florida.  HHN 2023:Everything we know about Universal Studios Halloween Horror Nights  5 mistakes I made at Universal OrlandoHow to save more time, money than me  What is the Villain-Con Minion Blast attraction?  “This will truly be a one-of-a-kind, interactive blaster game experience that will immerse guests in the world of Illumination’s Minions franchise as they compete to see if they have what it takes to be the next supervillain,” Thierry Coup, then-Senior Vice President of Universal Creative, told USA TODAY in December.  Fans will remember Villian-Con, the villain convention, from “Minions: The Rise of Gru.” Guests exiting Villain-Con Minion Blast will go through an all-new retail location called Evil Stuff, which will sell both Villain-Con and Minions merchandise.  The new attraction will be located on Illumination Avenue, where Shrek 4-D used to be, directly across from Despicable Me Minion Mayhem.  Can you meet the Minions in person?  Guests can meet Minions and other characters from their franchise like Gru, Margo, Edith and Agnes at an outdoor “Illumination Theater facade.”  And new to Universal Orlando, guests will also get to meet Rosita, Gunter and Johnny from the “Sing” films. Other Illumination characters may be seen in murals and photo opportunities around Minion Land.  Heading to Super Nintendo World?Tips for your first Universal Studios Hollywood visit  What’s cooking at Minion Cafe?  Minion Cafe will feature an entirely new menu, different from Universal Studios Hollywood’s Minion Cafe, Universal Orlando exclusively told USA TODAY.  There will be nearly 20 new dishes, including Otto’s Noodle Bowl, the Steak & “Cheese Ray” Sandwich and Carl’s Crispy Cauliflower, which will be vegan.  The sit-down eatery will feature three themed seating areas, the resort said in a news release:  ""The Kitchen – where guests will get a glimpse of the equipment and gear the Minions have used to whip up the cafe’s menu; the Breakroom – where guests can dine in the Minions’ break space that includes everything from ‘Office Safety Tips’ to a vending machine stocked with mischievous items; and the Dining Room – a vibrant space adorned with colorful artwork courtesy of the Minions and more.""  There will also be a walk-up express window, with a limited menu, for guests who don’t want to dine in.  What food do Minions eat?  Minions famously love bananas.  Guests will find banana (and regular) flavored popcorn at the new Pop-a-nana kiosk, which will also sell Minion popcorn buckets. For something even sweeter, guests can pop by Bake My Day, a bakery and retail shop with Minion-themed treats like cupcakes and macarons, or Freeze Ray Pops, a walk-up window with themed popsicles and cold drinks."

Trevor Jackson (Grown-ish, Superfly) will co-star. Myriad Pictures is shopping the project to buyers here in Cannes this week.  Mace is the harrowing story of two very different types of cops – a veteran officer Mace (LaBeouf), dangerous and corrupt, and Virgil Woods (Jackson), a young rookie who believes that he can change the system that fosters cops like Mace from within. It’s inspired by the recent racial injustice on the streets of America and Woods refuses to be bullied and pits his principles against the amoral Mac. Woods risks everything he believes to stop Mace from destroying the city when Mace unleashes a gang war to cover up his crimes. Everyone around Mace is in danger as Mace plays his game and tries to conceal his tracks, no matter the cost.  The Meyers Media Group production is projected to start later this year in New Jersey with additional casting underway. Lawrence Steven Meyers, John Evangelides, Randy Dannenberg and Robert Maclean will produce. Brendan McDonald and Kirk D’Amico will serve as exec producers. Tribune Pictures is onboard to co-produce and co-finance the film.  LaBeouf can next be seen in Francis Ford Coppola’s highly anticipated Megalopolis and he’s just joined the cast of David Mamet’s Assassination. He most recently wrapped production on Abel Ferarra’s Padre Pio which follows the life of the now saint during his time as a monk in Puglia, Italy.  Amiel is an award-winning director, writer and producer who garnered international acclaim for The Singing Detective and followed that with Queen of Hearts, which premiered in Cannes. His further credits include Tune in Tomorrow, with Keanu Reeves and Peter Falk, Copycat with Sigourney Weaver and Holly Hunter and Entrapment with Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones.  Myriad Pictures’ D’Amico said, “We are delighted that Shia LaBeouf will head up the cast for this film which explores the underbelly of a police precinct in contemporary New Jersey. We think that with Jon Amiel at the helm and Shia in the title role that the result will be extraordinary and exciting.”  Meyers added, “We are really excited to have assembled such a package. With the amazing screenplay, Jon at the helm, and Shia joining Trevor as the lead actors, it is an irresistible creative coup for us. Thankfully, the investment from Robert’s Tribune Pictures enabled us to greenlight the film in time for Myriad to bring it to the Cannes Market.”  Shia LaBeouf is represented by John Crosby Management and attorney Matt Saver."

On 16 April, a day after the fighting broke out in Khartoum, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), held an emergency Heads of State summit. It was attended virtually by the presidents of South Sudan, Kenya, Uganda and Djibouti. At the Summit, convened by IGAD’s executive secretary, the leaders called for a cessation of hostilities, opening of humanitarian corridors and a ceasefire to allow Sudanese citizens to peacefully observe the holy month of Ramadan.  In December last year, IGAD – alongside the other members of a Tripartite Mechanism constituted in June 2022, namely the UN and the African Union – brokered the Political Framework Agreement. The FA, as it is known, is the roadmap meant to take Sudan to civilian rule. It is a deal in which the generals agreed to relinquish power to civilians. According to the FA, a civilian government was to be formed by 11 April 2023. This didn’t happen. Four days later, the SAF and RSF were aiming guns at each other.  Formed in 1986 to tackle drought and desertification, twin preoccupations of the region’s developmentalist states, IGAD is composed of eight member states drawn from the Nile Valley, the Great Lakes and the Horn. Revitalised in 1996 with a specific mediation mandate, IGAD has been, for better or worse, the Horn’s conflict arbiter and its peace and security enforcer.  A difficult job in a tough neighbourhood, IGAD’s core strengths are its proximity to the region’s theatres of conflict – its conflict early warning mechanism, CEWARN, was designed to enhance this capability – and its accessibility to belligerents. But accessibility sometimes leads to paralysis, the most glaring example of which is the war in Tigray.  Peace-building in a tough neighbourhood  When IGAD has mediated successfully, it has done so because of the commitment of its dominant members – Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda – to stay the course: in Somalia over two decades, and in the Sudans, first midwifing the Comprehensive Peace Agreement between Omar al-Bashir’s NCP government and John Garang’s SPLM in 2004, and then intervening in South Sudan’s civil war between 2013 and 2018. And now in Khartoum, since the second coup in October 2019.  In Tigray, IGAD’s strengths became its major drawbacks. Bullied by Addis Ababa, it could not act without the approval of the Ethiopian state – a state of paralysis it shared with the Addis Ababa-headquartered African Union. In the end, secret arms deals between Gulf States and the Ahmed Abiy regime changed the course of the war. It was drones supplied by the Abiy’s Emirati and Turk friends that strafed the overstretched Tigrayan Defence Forces column advancing towards Addis Ababa, forcing them back into Tigray where a year-long siege forced them to the negotiating table in Pretoria.  The peace deal was eventually crafted under US tutelage, marginalising IGAD’s role in resolving the conflict. The same rings true for Somalia, where Qatar, Turkiye, the UAE, the US and the UK hold the most leverage over Hassan Sheikh Mahmoud, the current president.  Similarly, IGAD’s mediation of the civil war in South Sudan (2013-2018) came with the added complication of balancing the region’s oscillating positions, which were often influenced by Washington behind the scenes, or other members of the Troika (that is, Norway and the United Kingdom), against those of the dominant regional powers, who were themselves often interested in cutting backroom deals with individual members of the troika to advance their own narrow interests. However, it was ultimately IGAD’s commitment to the peace process that delivered the breakthrough agreement in September 2018.  A history of competing cartographies  But the Horn’s geopolitics are now increasingly shaped by rich Gulf hegemons for whom the region is a theatre for their competing commercial interests and ideological positions. In the ongoing conflict in Sudan, Saudi-Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) appear to hold the most leverage over the feuding generals, alongside Washington and London – the so-called ‘Quad’. More than anything, it is the growing influence of the larger Muslim world on the Horn of Africa that has become a determining factor in conflicts in the region.  Separated from the Middle East by the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden by as little as 60km, the colonial, cultural, religious and kinship ties between the old Ottoman Empire and the Horn of Africa are often overlooked, obscured by more recent readings of the Muslim world that privilege the colonial cartography of France and Britain. Consequently, while old-fashioned geopolitical analysis remains preoccupied with China’s growing influence in the region – as a counterweight, usually presented as problematic, to the West – Middle Eastern countries, especially the axis of Saudi-Arabia and the UAE on one side, and Qatar and Turkiye on the other, still operate below the radar of serious analysis.  Over the past two decades, however, Middle Eastern countries have been quietly building their influence in the Horn through bilateral military support and public infrastructure projects. In countries such as Somalia, Muslim states’ investments far outweigh Chinese capital. In the Horn, the UAE-based port logistics company, Dubai Ports World, has not only won 30-year concessions to develop and operate ports at Berbera in Somaliland and Bosaaso in Somalia’s semi-autonomous, federal state of Puntland, but it is negotiating a similar deal at the port of Kismayo in southern Somalia. A potential deal with Kenya to run the port of Mombasa leaked in 2022, causing a public outcry. The UAE government also has plans to establish military bases across the Horn. In sum, the Middle Eastern print in countries such as Djibouti, Eritrea, Somalia and Sudan is widening, with important consequences.  In Sudan, Saudi-Arabia and the UAE have long sought to shape events, seeing the transition from the disastrous three-decades long rule of Omar Ahmad al-Bashir as a way to roll back Islamist influence and stabilise the region. Investors from both Saudi-Arabia and the UAE have a range of interests in Sudan, from agricultural enterprises to an airline and strategic ports on the Red Sea coast. In this way, both Riyadh and Abu Dhabi have maintained a relationship with the feuding generals since they took power in 2021.  The return of al-Bashir’s Islamist crew  It is now known that the recent public appearance of Ali Karti, former foreign minister in the Bashir regime and currently the Secretary-General of the Islamic Movement, who has close relations with Islamists in SAF, irked both Saudi-Arabia and the UAE. Qatar, another rich Gulf state with geopolitical ambitions in the Horn of Africa, is known to be supportive of Islamist movements across the region. On learning that Bashir-era Islamists may be rising again under the SAF, the RSF, supported by Saudi-Arabia and the UAE, increased its deployments in Khartoum, intensifying tensions between al-Burhan and Hemedti.  Egypt, one of the few African countries holding some influence in Sudan, especially with Al-Burhan, successfully negotiated a ceasefire during the first week of the conflict, but only so that it could evacuate its 177 troops, based mostly in the northern town of Merowe, after which fighting resumed. At its southern border with Sudan, through which many civilians are fleeing the intensifying conflict, Egyptian officials seem reluctant to let in refugees, causing a serious humanitarian crisis at the border.  Libya, the other African country seemingly involved in the conflict, has denied its role in fanning the rift between the SAF and RSF. While Hemedti has accused Egypt of supporting Al-Burhan by sending soldiers and fighter jets to help the SAF – allegations that Egypt has denied – Libyan warlord, Khalifa Haftar, has reportedly sent military supplies to Hemedti’s RSF, which he also denies. Russia’s Wagner Group, suspected of supporting Hemedti, has denied that it is involved in Sudan. The US, the other instrumental actor in Sudan, has focussed most of its attention on evacuating its citizens, a request granted by Al-Burhan a few days after the fighting began.  Strange bedfellows  South Sudan, which exports its oil outputs of 170, 000 barrels per day via a 1,600-km pipeline through Sudan, its northern neighbour, has reported a disruption of logistics and transport links between its oilfields and Port Sudan. Its diplomats and military generals have offered to negotiate a truce between Al-Burhan and Hemedti, but this request, coming from an IGAD member that has itself endured conflict for several years, was derided in some quarters.  But it would be a mistake to ignore its significance, not least because of the history between Khartoum and Juba and a strong sense of reciprocity. Both Al-Burhan and Hemedti helped negotiate the 2018 peace deal between South Sudan’s president, Salva Kiir Mayardit and its current first vice-president, Riek Machar Teny. When Al-Bashir was ousted in 2019, South Sudan staged the Juba Agreement for Peace in Sudan, between the Transitional Government of Sudan, headed by then Prime Minister Abdallah Hamdok, Al-Burhan and other rebel movements in Sudan.  The Juba Peace Agreement considered various transitional justice issues, including the structure of government of a future Sudan and the parameters of absorption of the various armed movements into government forces. It was overtaken by the 25 October 2021 coup. Universal condemnation of the coup, including a suspension of Sudan from the AU, opened room for the beginning of the Tripartite Mechanism.  The FA sought to remove any formal role for the military in Sudan’s politics. The Tripartite mechanism that facilitated the FA also involved more than 40 civilian entities in the deliberations, including the Forces of Freedom and Change-Central Council (FFC-CC) – the only one of the three factions of the splintered 2019 protest movement willing to negotiate with the military – and a number of political parties and CSOs, notably including the Call for Sudan’s People Initiative, and former armed movements, all allied to the military.  The rise of the Quad, and IGAD’s retreat  But it is perhaps the ‘Quad’, consisting of Saudi-Arabia and the UAE, alongside the US and the UK, that holds the most influence over Al-Burhan and Hemedti. When contentious issues, especially regarding the place of the RSF in the future of Sudan persisted after the signing of the FA, and tensions between the two generals emerged, it is the Quad that negotiated a truce on 11 March. It didn’t hold.  Unlike its predecessor, the AU at its formation granted itself the power to intervene in the internal affairs of a member-state to restore peace and stability, to prevent widespread atrocities and genocide. In the aftermath of the Rwanda genocide, the AU was keen to spell out that the right to intervene in a member state’s territory would be shared between the UN Security Council, the AU itself and/or other regional blocs across the continent.  This experiment was first put to the test in Burundi and Sudan’s Darfur region, when the AU deployed peacekeepers. The African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) used the same template in 2007.  A major drawback for an interventionist AU was its reliance on external funding, which often force it to bow to the dictates of the West, particularly the US, UK and the EU, despite its direct mandate to protect the continent’s people.  IGAD’s mediating authority is further undermined by its member states, themselves facing multiple domestic challenges, worsened by a global economic recession. Take Kenya, which, as chair of the UN Security Council in 2021, led the UN’s mediation efforts in Tigray, is a major guarantor of state-building efforts in Somalia, and leads the East African Community Regional Force in the Democratic Republic of Congo. However, not only has the Kenyan state found itself locked in a protracted democratic transition at home, but its reputation as a haven of regional economic stability is being seriously threatened by a crippling debt crisis.  The Horn’s perennial dilemma  Ethiopia, the other IGAD member with a history as regional power-broker, is struggling to lift itself up from the Tigray war, whose tenuous resolution could be upset anytime by Eritrea. While both Kenya and Ethiopia are expected to rise to the occasion in resolving the conflict in Sudan, care must also be taken not to create competition between the two countries as regional peace builders. In the final analysis, any revamp plan for IGAD will most certainly require foreign funding, in this case, the EU, putting the question, again, over who has the leverage in resolving the region’s conflicts.  A case in point is a meeting on 27 April by the Heads of State of Troop Contributing Countries (TCC) under the African Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS) held in Entebbe, Uganda, which expressed concern over what they described as inadequate, unsustainable and unpredictable funding. Some ATMIS (formerly AMISOM) troops haven’t been paid for months, at a time when the mission is supposed to round-up its operations in Somalia and hand-over the security responsibilities to the Federal Government.  In Sudan, the asymmetry between competing external actors and regional blocs increasingly reliant on the same hegemons for individual and collective financial support, presents us with that perennial dilemma so characteristic of three decades of conflict in the Horn: the imperative to strike a deal, however transient, between the men with guns establishes a lopsided peace. How can a lasting peace be organised in which the democratic demands of the civilian forces are not merely an afterthought?"

Boris Titov, head of the Russian delegation of the Cuban-Russian Business Committee, told a forum of Russian entrepreneurs in Havana that Cuba had decisively opened the door to Russian investment.  ""They are giving us preferential treatment,"" Titov told the packed forum in Havana´s Hotel Nacional. ""The path is clear.""  Titov said Cuba had offered Russian businesses the right to make use of Cuban land for 30 year-terms, an unusual concession to foreign firms in the communist-run country.  He said Cuba would also exempt Russian companies from import tariffs on certain technology, and would allow Russian firms to repatriate their profits, a benefit in Cuba´s state-dominated economy.  The two countries, on opposite sides of the globe, are also considering ways to fast-track shipping between them, Titov said.  ""In Soviet times there was a direct port and maritime link,"" Titov told the forum. ""We are analyzing this possibility with the owners of Cuban ships.""  Cuba in recent months has sought to woo investors from Russia and other politically allied nations in a bid to shore up its devastated economy, ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic, harsh U.S. sanctions and rampant inefficiencies.  Russia, also reeling from Western sanctions over the conflict in Ukraine, has in recent months moved to strengthen economic ties with Cuba and other Latin American countries opposed to what it calls U.S. hegemony.  Ricardo Cabrisas, Cuba´s minister of foreign commerce told reporters on the sidelines of the forum that the economic ties between Russia and Cuba would only grow stronger.  ""Nothing and no one can stop it,"" Cabrisas said.  Bilateral trade between Cuba and Russia reached $450 million in 2022, three times that of 2021, according to Sergei Baldin, Russia´s trade representative in Cuba.  Baldin said 90% of that trade was comprised of sales of petroleum products and soy oil.  (Reporting by Dave Sherwood in Havana; Editing by Alistair Bell)"

A Pittsburgh native who played for Serra Catholic high school, Jackson was named first-team all-state at defensive back and second-team as an athlete in 2017, before joining the local Vulcans. He was drawn five-and-a-half hours east to Schiano, Dave Brock, offensive coordinator Kirk Ciarrocca, and their NFL backgrounds, which Jackson feels can help him reach the NFL himself.  Offensive line coach Pat Flaherty, who coached offensive linemen or tight ends for the New York Giants, 49ers, Redskins, Bears, Jaguars and Dolphins, add to Rutgers’ pro ties, which Jackson prioritized after spending five years at a small school.  Rutgers’ quarterback heading into the fall, Wimsatt completed just 44.8% of his passes for 757 yards while throwing five touchdowns and seven interceptions last season. He said improving his mechanics comes down to “more consistency”.  “Just being intentional with your work,” Wimsatt said when asked what goes into that consistency. “Whenever you’re doing any drill just be intentional about it. Every rep counts.”  Adding a player with the tools that Jackson brings can bolster an offense that moved with more intention this spring.  Jackson was hosted on his Rutgers official visit by junior wide receiver Chris Long, who alongside Wimsatt, spent the weekend tethered to Jackson’s hip. The visit consisted mostly of football meetings and schematic and developmental details.  It was topped off by lounging and fine dining in New York City with coaches and veteran players, including junior safety Max Melton, a likely early-round NFL Draft pick.  Senior Naseim Brantley will return from injury this summer while Long and sophomore Rashad Rochelle — another speedster — round into top targets, joining senior Isaiah Washington, from Jacksonville, Fla., on Wimsatt’s receiver route tree next fall.

The iconic dark ride, which also operates at Universal Orlando Resort in Florida, US, first opened at Universal Studios Japan on January 23, 2004.    Offering the same experience as its Orlando counterpart, the Spider-Man dark ride takes guests on a high-paced adventure with Spider-Man, as he tries to prevent the Sinister Syndicate - a supervillain criminal organisation made up of Doctor Octopus, Scream, Hydro-Man, Hobgoblin and Electro - from stealing the Statue of Liberty.    Combining an Omnimover system with both 3D and 4D elements, the ride was developed by an A-list of attractions industry veterans, including former senior VP and chief creative officer at Universal Creative Thierry Coup; Scott Trowbridge, portfolio creative executive at Walt Disney Imagineering; and Philip Hettema, president and creative director of The Hettema Group.    The ride came as part of a major expansion of Universal Studios Japan - the first since the park first opened to the public in 2001. It will close on January 22, 2024, just one day shy of its twentieth anniversary, as Marvel's 20-year licensing agreement with Universal for the Japanese rights expires.    While the licensing agreement with Marvel is expiring in Japan, it's unlikely that the Orlando version of the attraction will suffer the same fate, as Universal's rights agreement with Marvel for the region continues indefinitely.    This closure follows the recent shutdown of the nearby Terminator 2 3D attraction. Universal has not yet announced replacements for either attraction, leading to speculation that a permanent Pokémon land could be planned for the park.    To commemorate the ride's closing, Universal Studios Japan will launch The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man final campaign ride experience, available from July, which includes a special sticker celebrating the ride. Commemorative merchandise is also likely to be released.    Theme park    "

What is happening is potentially worse.  According to military and police officials, the possibility of the MUP pension system being reformed creates the possibility of wholesale early retirement in the security and public order agencies. If this happens in any significant scale, we could see our military and police agencies seriously decimated.  Choosing early retirement is a right – even if the possibility of dislocation is great. It will take years to train replacements for personnel choosing early retirement. That might not happen quickly enough. In the meantime, we will have to try and cope with gutted services.  We are told that the proposal to reform the MUP pension system is now causing serious demoralization in the ranks. But not undertaking the reform has become unsustainable.  The MUP pension system is a textbook case of myopic policymaking – in this case animated by the desire to curry political favor with the uniformed sector. This sector has been allowed a separate pension system where member contributions are minimal and benefits are generous.  This is an unsustainable system. It can only be kept afloat through humongous subsidies. Government now coughs up hundreds of billions to support this badly designed pension system. If left unattended, the subsidy will run into the trillions.  It seems this system was designed for popularity points in complete disregard of actuarial science. This is, unfortunately, how many of our policies are shaped.  This is a benefits-driven system, a way of rewarding the loyalty of our uniformed personnel without the transparency of a wage schedule. No one in the policy- and law-making process gave a thought about sustainability. It is as if government coffers are there for the looting.  A benefit, once granted, is very difficult to withdraw. We see that in the angry protest actions going on in France over the thoroughly sane proposal to raise the retirement age from the present 62 to 64. Even after adjustment, the French retirement age is still lower than what prevails elsewhere. And even after that adjustment, the pension system is still not sustainable, considering the aging population.  In our case, the faulty actuarial design of the MUP pension system is aggravated by the fact that our soldiers are made to retire at 56 – a waste, considering all the money spent on their training. After that, they begin receiving pensions. Soldiers who retire tend to live longer lives. That means they could be receiving pensions for more years than they actually served.  Add to this the survivorship clauses that allow spouses to continue collecting from the pension system. That extends the payout period even more.  Under the MUP, a retired officer could expect to receive P40,000 monthly for the rest of his life. That is much higher than what SSS and GSIS retirees get – even if, during their active service, MUPs contributed a much smaller share of their pay than those in the other two pension systems.  Government cannot continue funding the MUP pension fund without raising taxes dramatically across the board – or by wanton borrowing. It will be very hard to qualify borrowing to support a badly designed pension fund. Therefore, the borrowing is likely to cost more.  The GSIS and the SSS have both been criticized for having short actuarial lives. There is real danger that younger Filipinos in the workforce might be unable to collect pensions by the time they retire.  By comparison, the MUP pension system has no actuarial life to speak of. It already depends on subsidies to cover their payouts.  Much has been said about the irresponsible borrowing that brought us to a severe debt crisis in the eighties. Not enough has been said, however, about the fact that much of the borrowing prior to the debt crisis went to the Napocor and the MWSS. Government subsidized electricity and water to placate the people. A large portion of the debt we continue to pay to this day went to electricity and water consumers.  Today, unless the MUP pension system is dramatically reformed, we will be in danger of piling up our debt stock even more to subsidize an actuarially unsustainable setup. Those who enjoy the sumptuous benefits from the failed MUP system – and those who will try to lock in their benefits by retiring early – must be reminded that the payouts are made possible only by large public subsidies.  There is catastrophe lying in wait down the road. The MUP pension system has failed. The GSIS and SSS could fail in due time if contributions are not increased. Government will have a financing problem in the trillions if all pension systems are not corrected today.  But reconfiguring the pension system will be a political challenge. We have seen how everyone reflexively opposes any effort to raise contributions to the pension funds. Meanwhile, we all expect the SSS and the GSIS to suspend loan collections for communities hit by calamity. Our political system is not the most financially literate in the world.  In the particular case of the MUP pensions system, government will have to muster political will in heroic proportions to get the reforms done. The community of uniformed personnel is a powerful lobby group in our system. This community will definitely exert pressure for government to abandon pension reforms.  In they are unable to block the reforms, many will opt for early retirement. They will take the money and run. Patriotism will not hold them back."

The coup;e broke up soon after. However, what followed was a lot of controversial statements in public. Adhyayan’s father Shekhar Suman too, had slammed Kangana multiple times on social media or in interviews.  But now, years later, the ‘Dekh Bhai Dekh’ actor has mentioned that he was never against Adhyayan’s relationship with Kangana.  Speaking to Bollywood Hungama, he said, “I was aware of every single moment. But I never talked to Kangana. That’s his battle, he has to fight it. I can only give him the strength to fight that battle. I cannot fight his battles. I can never be that dad who would go and tell the other person, ‘tumne mere bachche ke saath..(why did you wrong my child)’. I think he is man enough and can fight his battles.”  Shekhar further said in the same interview, “I am never against any relationship. I was not against his relationship with Kangana. I think it’s a phase in life; sometimes you succeed in your first relationship, and sometimes you fail. Nobody wants that they fail in their first relationship. But society loves drama. People would have wanted Kangana and Adhyayan's relationship to end. Sometimes even your friends do not want your happiness.”  Talking about the disastrous end to their relationship, Shekhar added, “It was neither Adhyayan nor Kangana’s fault. It was the fault of circumstances because of which some things happened which were not meant to be. It should always end on a good note. Also, if by mistake Adhyayan said anything that he shouldn’t have, he apologised. He doesn’t have any anger for anybody.”"

Speaking about the Supreme Court’s ongoing efforts to accept charges against hundreds of January 8 rioters, Mr. Múcio said: “If we have relatives, friends, colleagues, soldiers, sailors, pilots who committed irresponsibilities, they [should be] punished.”  Of the 1,390 people charged in connection with the January 8 riots — when hordes of pro-Bolsonaro demonstrators stormed and ransacked the buildings that house Brazil’s three branches of government — several are retired military officers or their relatives.  Hundreds of the demonstrators joined the riots after leaving a pro-Bolsonaro putschist camp — set up shortly after Jair Bolsonaro’s defeat in the October election — outside the Army’s headquarters in Brasília.  On January 2, shortly after taking office and days before the riots, the defense minister said that he himself had relatives in the protest camps, but argued that they were simply a “manifestation of democracy.” He added that he believed the camps would “fade away” and refused to use his authority to dismantle them.  In late 2022, local Brasília police tried to dismantle the putschist camp, but they were prevented from doing so by the Army, which has jurisdiction over military areas. After President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva was sworn in on January 1, his Defense Ministry and government as a whole took no further action against the camp until after the riots. The camp was dismantled on the morning of January 9, and hundreds of people were arrested.  A report by the Justice Ministry later found that the protest camp was “central” to the unrest.  In addition to the retired military members who took part in the riots, the role of some active-duty officers is under investigation. Lula last month fired General Gonçalves Dias, his top security official, after leaked surveillance footage showed him to be inside the presidential palace on January 8.  Today’s public hearing was also a preview of the upcoming joint select committee on the January 8 riots. Two far-right lawmakers, Ricardo Salles and Marcel van Hattem, criticized the Armed Forces — a move that would have been unthinkable coming from them during the Bolsonaro administration.  Mr. van Hattem said that “what happened on January 8 ruined the credibility of the Armed Forces for a large part of the Brazilian population.” The strategy is clearly aimed at blaming the military for failing to stop the riots and whitewashing then-President Jair Bolsonaro’s very public efforts to threaten a coup and incite his voters to reject the election results.  Congressman van Hattem persisted in his putschist discourse, asking Army Commander Tomás Paiva: “What are the Armed Forces doing to reverse this [situation]? Because every day you salute a crook [a reference to Lula], the situation gets worse.” Other lawmakers fired back, stating that Mr. van Hattem has refused to accept Mr. Bolsonaro’s electoral defeat.  General Paiva politely replied that the military is “fulfilling its constitutional mission.”"

Sudanese security forces have arrested three activists from the country’s pro-democracy movement, according to a family member, their peers and local media reports.  Mohamad “Tupac” Adam, Mohamad al-Fattah and Mohamad al-Bushra were arrested while convening a meeting at a primary school to discuss how to aid internally displaced people on Tuesday morning in Madani, a city in northern Jazeera state, Adam’s mother told Al Jazeera.  Adam and al-Fattah often distributed food and aid to people arriving in the city after fleeing the conflict in the capital Khartoum, activists and residents said.  They added that the young men were detained by the Central Reserve Police Force, which is aligned with the Sudanese army in its fight against the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).  “I’m very scared and I don’t know what to do now,” Adam’s mother, Nidal Arbab Suliman, told Al Jazeera from her home in the capital Khartoum. “I’m afraid that if anyone else in our family leaves the house, they will be beaten up or arrested.”  It was not immediately clear why the men were arrested. Al Jazeera has contacted Sudan’s army spokesman Nabil Abdullah for comment.      Activists and analysts say the arrests on Tuesday are part of a broader campaign by the army and allied forces to crack down on well-known personalities from the pro-democracy movement and consolidate control over aid relief.  Since the conflict erupted on April 15, medics, journalists and politicians have been smeared, threatened and attacked. Members of the resistance committees – neighbourhood groups leading calls for democracy and providing vital provisions to civilians caught in the fighting – are also being targeted.  On May 7, the army detained two men from a resistance committee for escorting wounded RSF fighters to a hospital, before publishing a statement that justified the arrests by equating the activists with enemy combatants.  The two were released the following day after a public outcry.  “One narrative the army has tried to portray is that because resistance committees are engaged in humanitarian work, they are somehow supporting the RSF,” Hamid Murtada, a Sudanese analyst and a member of a resistance committee, told Al Jazeera from Cairo in Egypt, where he recently arrived after fleeing Khartoum.  “That gives the [army] an excuse to target them, kidnap them and even kill them.”  Torture and maltreatment  Adam and al-Fattah were among hundreds of prisoners who escaped last month after the RSF attacked prisons in Khartoum.  Adam was previously detained by security forces two months after the October 2021 military coup that derailed the country’s transition to democracy, after taking part in anti-coup protests. He and two other people were accused of killing a police officer. Adam’s lawyers said he was denied due process and was tortured.  His case became a rallying cry of the pro-democracy movement, prompting rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch to advocate for a fair trial and humane treatment.  But as the conflict in Sudan escalates, there is increasing domestic and international focus on allegations of human rights abuses but less attention on the treatment of prisoners. Rights groups have documented accounts of sexual abuse and rape, allegations of arbitrary arrests and abductions and damage to medical facilities.  The lack of monitoring means that the de facto authorities have little reason to fear repercussions for subjecting prisoners to maltreatment, according to Emma DiNapoli, an expert in international law who has followed Adam and al-Fattah’s cases.  “Even before the conflict … prisons were overcrowded, detainees were routinely subjected to torture and ill-treatment and the judiciary was not up to the task of safeguarding rights. Tupac and al-Fattah’s experiences in prison bear this out,” she told Al Jazeera.  “Now, given the situation in Sudan, we can only expect a deterioration in conditions in detention centres, with very high risks of torture or deprivation of food and water and only limited ability by lawyers to monitor conditions and advocate for detainees.”  Competing for legitimacy  Military intelligence arrested three more resistance committee members from Khartoum North on Tuesday, the area’s resistance committee tweeted.  It said in a statement that the activists were taken from their homes without explanation.  Murtada said he believes that the army and its allies are attempting to disrupt and punish resistance committees for assuming the role of service provision in order to consolidate control over the humanitarian response.  Since the conflict started, the committees have procured fuel to power hospitals, managed food and medicine distributions and set up clinics across the capital.      “[The arrests of activists] manifested in how the [army] is trying to control the international assistance coming in,” Murtada said.  Last week, Sudan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs called on international aid organisations to coordinate relief distribution with the Humanitarian Aid Commission (HAC), a government agency.  “Unfortunately, the international community isn’t saying no to [cooperating with the army] despite knowing how the entities of the Sudanese Armed Forces like HAC can’t be trusted to deliver humanitarian assistance,” Murtada told Al Jazeera. “The army is using [aid] for political gain.”  Additional reporting by Hiba Saleh Abdel Azeem"

Of course, it’s a shame that President Biden isn’t visiting next week. The image of the leaders of the United States, India, Japan and Australia assembling at the Sydney Opera House would have been a coup for Anthony Albanese and a show of solidarity by four democracies in the face of China’s challenging behaviour.  Biden’s speech to the Australian parliament would have been a notable moment in the history of the alliance.  More significantly, his visit to Port Moresby would have been the first by a sitting president to a Pacific Island country and a chance to finalise the new US-PNG security agreement.  So, Washington has missed an opportunity this week. But let’s keep things in perspective.  In America’s messy and disaggregated political system, the executive doesn’t control the legislature. Biden’s top priority in the coming week is to prevent the US government from defaulting on its debt, which would cause global financial instability and undercut American economic leadership. Biden judged that his presence in Washington was required to avoid that outcome. Should he have taken a chance with the global economy in order to save our blushes?  Advertisement  Americans need to take care that their domestic problems don’t spill over into foreign policy. But Biden’s cancellation is not a symptom of post-imperial decline. Bill Clinton cancelled a trip to APEC to avoid a government shutdown in 1995, when America was in the full flush of its unipolar moment.  Neither is it a sign of presidential “frailty”. Biden is a serious political figure and a potent foreign policy president.  Should he have taken a chance with the global economy in order to save our blushes?  In 2020, Biden did America’s allies a great service by marching the appalling and dangerous Donald Trump out of the White House.  His administration has responded to Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine with strength and subtlety. It has brought consistency to the US relationship with China. Last week, Biden’s National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan spent two days in Vienna talking sense to his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi.  The White House’s decision does not “raise questions about the reliability of the United States as a regional ally”, as political editor of The Australian Financial Review Phillip Coorey reported on Thursday.  Advertisement  On the contrary, Biden has restored America’s regional alliances after the trauma of the Trump years. He has deepened diplomatic and defence links with Japan.  Last month, he closed a deal with the president of South Korea to counter the nuclear threat from Pyongyang and prevent Seoul from pursuing its own nuclear deterrent.  This month, Biden hosted Ferdinand Marcos jnr – the first Philippines president to visit the Oval Office in a decade – and reinvigorated US-Filipino military ties.  It was Biden who first convened the Quad countries at the leaders’ level. Hopefully, the four leaders will now meet in Hiroshima and advance the Quad’s agenda.  What about Australia? As part of AUKUS, Biden agreed to share one of America’s most advanced technologies – its naval nuclear propulsion system – to enable us to build a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines.  This is a “big bet” on Australia, Jake Sullivan told the Lowy Institute in 2021. “We trust you, we believe in you. And we believe even more importantly in our collective combined capacity to produce greater stability, security and deterrence in the Indo-Pacific region.”  Advertisement  Some commentators seem to have a case of nerves. They should take their lead instead from the Australian public.  Over the course of nearly two decades of Lowy Institute polling – and even at the depths of the misbegotten Iraq war – strong majorities of Australians have seen the US alliance as “very” or “fairly” important for Australia’s security. In the 2023 Lowy Institute Poll, which will be released next month, eight in 10 (82 per cent) continue to see the alliance as important to our security. One presidential no-show won’t change that long-held view.  The US presence in Asia gives structure to the region, which would otherwise be dominated by one giant authoritarian power. Through our active diplomacy in South-East Asia and the Pacific, as well as through the alliance, AUKUS and the Quad, Australia is contributing to a stable balance of power.  Nothing has changed this week. The sky remains in place."

Four Fiji political parties were suspended for 30 days on Wednesday for not submitting audited accounts, local media reported.

Led by Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio and several right-leaning Christian advocacy groups, the backlash spurred the Dodgers to announce on Twitter that the team had rescinded the invitation, saying the Sisters’ inclusion was simply too controversial.  “In the spirit of unity, the Los Angeles Dodgers are proud to host our 10th annual LGBTQ+ Pride Night on June 16th,” the tweet said. “Given the strong feelings of people who have been offended by the sisters’ inclusion in our evening, and in an effort not to distract from the great benefits that we have seen over the years of Pride Night, we are deciding to remove them from this year’s group of honorees.”  “The ‘sisters’ are men who dress in lewd imitation of Roman Catholic nuns,” Rubio wrote in a letter to Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred. “The group’s motto, ‘Go and sin some more,’ is a perversion of Jesus’s command to ‘Go, and sin no more.’”  In San Francisco, where the kabuki-makeup-wearing Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence was founded in 1979, the group is known for producing the Hunky Jesus and Foxy Mary contests on Easter Sunday in Dolores Park and for collecting donations at the gates to the Folsom Street Fair.  Sister Roma, the “most photographed nun in the world,” was unsparing in her criticism.  “In two short hours, we went from celebrating the fact that they were giving us the Amazing Heroes Awards to basically caving to these pseudo-Christian media outlets and far-right conservative bigots like Marco Rubio,” Roma told The Standard. “It’s just insane to me that, here in California, the Dodgers would so quickly cave to this obvious bullshit rhetoric and hate.”  The fact that it happened in progressive California should send a signal to LGBTQ+ Americans that the reaction against queer visibility is not confined to red states like Florida, she said.  “This doesn’t bode well for the future for anyone who’s queer, trans, has an alternative lifestyle, for women,” Roma added. “People need to realize that these fascists are planning a coup of our entire country.”  San Francisco Pride has worked with the San Francisco Giants to produce large-scale events at Oracle Park. Executive Director Suzanne Ford, a trans woman, defended the Sisters’ work.  “I would like to highlight that they’re excluding a group that has helped countless people in the LGBTQ community in their fundraising efforts,” Ford said. “They’ve fed and housed people for years. That shouldn't get lost in all this.”  In the years since workplace protections were codified and marriage equality became legal nationwide, many LGBTQ+ rights organizations have seen professional sports as one of the few remaining domains of American life where institutional homophobia and LGBTQ+ exclusion remain the norm.  Although Pride Night has increasingly been a staple at American stadiums in June, homophobic incidents are not uncommon. In 2020, an announcer for the Cincinnati Reds was suspended for using an anti-gay slur. And the backlash against transgender athletes in sports has become part of a pretext for a wider crusade against LGBTQ+ visibility more generally."

The party’s win signifies a drastic change in the country’s political landscape. With goals for radical reform, Move Forward aims to challenge Thailand’s military-backed government which has ruled since 2014.  There are still barriers to Limjoroenrat becoming prime minister: as a new party Move Forward will have to persuade established opposition groups to co-operate in a coalition while also avoiding any intervention by Thailand’s deeply conservative military-royalist establishment. But there’s no doubting the impact the 42-year old and his party is having on politics in Thailand.  So, what do we know about Pita Limjoroenrat?  A Harvard educated, MIT Sloan MBA graduate  Pita Limjoroenrat is highly educated, having first graduated with a bachelor's degree in finance from Bangkok’s Thammasat University he later moved to the US to gain an MA in Public Policy from Harvard University.  This was followed by an MBA from the MIT Sloan School of Management, one of the most prestigious MBAs in the world—MIT came fourth in the US News & World Report 2023 Ranking, 11th in the Financial Times MBA Ranking 2023 and is one of the elite M7 business schools.  After graduating from MIT before his 25th birthday, Limjoroenrat was forced to begin his career in business after the death of his father. Taking over the running of his late father's rice bran oil company for several years, he later worked as an executive director for the Singapore-based ride and delivery app, Grab Thailand.  Alongside this strong business pedigree is a highly political background. His father was an adviser to the Thai agriculture ministry, while his uncle worked as an aide to Thai Thaksin Shinawatra—the billionaire telecoms tycoon and populist former premier who was unseated in a coup in 2006.  Limjoroenrat entered the political landscape in 2019, elected as the leader of the progressive Future Forward party which was controversially forced to disband after winning an unprecedented amount of votes in election polls that year.  The party was reincarnated as Move Forward, which was formed on the back of a series of anti-monarchy protests led by young and urban voters in 2020, who were frustrated by the endless cycle of military coups and crackdowns.  As the party’s charismatic leader, Limjoroenrat has since increased his popularity by posting viral social media campaign videos, showcasing him talking to street vendors while accompanied by his seven-year-old daughter.  Although he has not yet secured the premiership, following the general election results Limjoroenrat declared on Monday that he is “ready to be the next prime minister.”  Limjoroenrat is not the only MIT Sloan MBA to make waves after graduation. The highly academic degree is known for developing principled, innovative leaders including former Microsoft chairman, John W Thompson, and HubSpot co-founder Brian Halligan.  Next Read:"

Ramesh Rajasingham, head of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Geneva and director of the Coordination Division, said the fighting in Sudan has been a “cruel blow to the people of Sudan.”  Rajasingham said the conflict has left at least 676 dead, with the true toll likely much higher.

The Sudanese army, led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, is battling the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, led by General Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo.  The two generals are former allies who together orchestrated an October 2021 military coup that derailed a transition to civilian rule following the 2019 ouster of longtime leader Omar al-Bashir.  Tensions between the generals have been growing over disagreements about how the Rapid Support Forces should be integrated in the army and who should oversee that process.

Diplomatic sources familiar with the development told The Express Tribune that China, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in particular were worried over the deteriorating political stability in Pakistan.  When Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang recently undertook his maiden trip to Pakistan, he publicly expressed concerns over the current political situation and stressed the need for reaching a consensus to deal with the crisis.  The Chinese foreign minister was in Pakistan on May 5 and 6 on his first visit to Islamabad.

This was unusual on the part of China, which usually works behind the scenes to convey its concerns on any issue.  There were reports that the UAE president in a telephonic conversation with the Pakistani army chief called for unity in the country, a subtle message to resolve issues through talks.  It is believed that Saudi Arabia is also keen to seek some semblance of political stability returning to Pakistan.  Although there was no official confirmation, the visit of the deputy interior minister of Saudi Arabia was also seen in the context of efforts by Pakistan’s friends to defuse the ongoing political tensions.

The most prominent role Saudi Arabia played was after the 1999 coup when Riyadh managed to secure the release of former premier Nawaz Sharif as part of a deal with then military ruler General Pervez Musharraf.  Some observers believe that Pakistan’s friends may be concerned over the political stability in the country but none of them was willing to directly become involved.  “Yes, our friends indirectly do keep on passing messages to all sides to put our house in order,” said a source.  However, the source added that the current political situation in Pakistan was so toxic that no country could take the risk of directly interfering in its internal matters. “But the discreet messaging will continue,” the source continued."

Partners Relief and Development/Handout via REUTERS  Hundreds of people, including Rohingya Muslims, were feared dead after a cyclone struck Myanmar at the weekend, residents and aid groups said on Tuesday, with rescue efforts hampered by damage to infrastructure.  Myanmar's impoverished Rakhine State bore the brunt of Cyclone Mocha, during which winds of up to 210 kph (130 mph) ripped roofs off homes and brought a storm surge that inundated the state capital Sittwe.  The region has a large population of Rohingya Muslims, a persecuted minority that successive Myanmar governments have refused to recognise. More than a million live in sprawling camps in neighbouring Bangladesh, having fled military crackdowns in recent years.  Myanmar has been gripped by political and economic chaos since the military seized power in a coup in 2021. Since then, fighting has raged across the country between the military and pro-democracy or allied ethnic armed groups.  Residents of Rakhine State said at least 100 people had been killed and many more were missing and feared dead, adding that aid had yet to arrive. Bangladesh faced its worst power cuts in over seven months.  Reuters was not able to independently verify the death toll.  A resident in the area, who declined to be identified over concerns for his safety, told Reuters more than 100 Rohingya were killed, based on assessments from multiple villages he said he had visited in the aftermath.  Two other residents contacted by Reuters also said a large number of people had been killed, as did a diplomatic source briefed on the situation, who did not provide details.  News portal Myanmar Now reported hundreds were feared dead, while aid groups said there were a ""significant number of deaths"".  Myanmar's state media said three people were killed.  A spokesperson for the pro-democracy shadow National Unity Government told Reuters: ""We received confirmation of about 400 Rohingya deaths, mainly around Sittwe area"".  The storm was one of the worst since Cyclone Nargis swept across parts of southern Myanmar killing nearly 140,000 people in 2008.  'NIGHTMARE SCENARIO'  A United Nations official said 5.4 million people were expected to have been in the storm's path, the majority of whom were considered vulnerable.  ""It's really a nightmare scenario for the cyclone to hit areas with such deep pre-existing needs,"" said Ramanathan Balakrishnan at the UN's Office of Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Shelter, water, sanitation, and relief items were early priorities, he said.  Storm damage to communications and road infrastructure and ongoing restrictions by Myanmar's military government was making it difficult to get information from and deliver aid to the affected area, non-governmental organisations said.  ""It's difficult to obtain accurate or up to date information, which also makes responding to the crisis adequately even more difficult,"" said Manny Maung of Human Rights Watch.  Non-governmental relief organisation Partners said on Twitter: ""We are scaling up our response effort to provide critical relief supplies like rice and tarps to Rohingya communities affected by Cyclone Mocha as we are able.""  Myanmar's state media on Tuesday said junta chief Min Aung Hlaing had visited Sittwe to assess the damage, donate money and give instructions on the response.  Before the storm made landfall on Sunday about 400,000 people were evacuated in Myanmar and Bangladesh.  The U.N. humanitarian office (OCHA) said about 6 million people in the region were already in need of humanitarian assistance before the storm, among them 1.2 million people internally displaced by ethnic conflict."

Born in Hebron, Nebraska, Beverly Deepe Keever earned her journalism degree from University of Nebraska and a master’s from New York’s Columbia University. At age 26, she bought a one-way ticket to Asia to teach English and sell freelance stories to the Associated Press.  “I went into journalism because I wanted to understand people and culture in other countries,” Deepe Keever said.

The U.S. government sent 500 military advisors to help South Vietnam, and more U.S. troops began pouring in. In 1962, Deepe Keever sent a letter to her friend in Nebraska describing her experience.  “I am undergoing a shock treatment here,” she wrote. “All those professional and personal ideals which had never been shattered until I reached here seem to be under constant bombardment. The things that happen in the country would be a bombshell to the American public.”  Friends and family read Deepe Keever’s newspaper reports about all the fighting in Vietnam from 8,600 miles away.  “Paul would call up Dad,” she said. “’Get that girl out of there. Get that girl out of there.’ And Dad said, ‘We don’t even know how to contact her.’”"

Alfredo Castro – one of Latin America’s most respected actors and a Pablo Larraín regular, star of films such as “Karnawal” and “El Club” – leads the mini-series cast as Allende; Benjamín Vicuña (“Besieged,” “Locked Up”) plays Cuban dictator Fidel Castro.  The four-episode, 55-minute fiction drama shoot is taking place entirely in Chile, lensing from May 15 for two months, under “Besieged” and “Inés of My Soul” director Nicolás Acuña.  Leonora González and Sergio Gándara, Parox co-founders, are respectively the mini-series’ showrunner and producer.  A Chile-Spain-Argentina co-production, “Allende, the Thousand Days” teams Spain’s Mediterráneo Media Entertainment and Argentine companies Aleph, Mente Colectiva and HD Argentina.  Chilean public broadcaster TVN, Spanish nationwide group RTVE and Argentina’s Canal 9 are also backing the project.  “The Spanish part brings to the table talent and financing; Argentina puts talent, services and financing,” Gándara explained.  Written by Carla Stagno (“Sayen”), Cristián Jiménez (“Bonsai,” “Family Life”), Paco Mateo (“Inés of My Soul”) and Pablo Manzi, “Allende, the Thousand Days” tells the story of the last three years of the Chilean president and the experience in government of his Unidad Popular party, narrated by Manuel Ruiz, a 25-year-old Spaniard who becomes a close adviser to the president.  A fictional character, Ruiz is inspired by Spanish lawyer and political scientist Joan Garcés and played by Barcelona-born thesp Pablo Capuz (“Merlí. Sapere Aude”).  Allende died during the Sept. 11, 1973 coup d’etat of General Augusto Pinochet, whose troops shelled the Chilean government headquarters, in La Moneda Palace.  In the series, Ruiz accompanies Allende in La Moneda. He’s ready for anything, but minutes before the bombing, Allende tells him that he has to survive to tell the world what he saw in Chile.  “Allende is mainly known for his political decision to commit suicide in La Moneda while the government palace was bombed by the armed forces that had to protect the Chilean constitution,” showrunner Leonora González argued, calling his death a “tragic and symbolic act meaning that his name is in squares, streets, schools, hospitals in many countries around the world.”  “We want to go further to show the president in his complexity, in his feats, difficulties and contradictions, so that the audience can travel with Allende and the characters who accompany him, get emotional and suffer with them,” she noted.  The references for “Allende, the Thousand Days’” production come from series such as “Borgen” and “The West Wing” and movies such as “Darkest Hour” and “Argentina, 1985.”  “Despite the tragic final act of Allende’s death, we also want to show the light, joy, and hope that lay behind the project led by him,” González said.  She added: “Finally, [we want] to tell the story of a politician who, in a Cold War context, thought it was possible to make a unique social and economic transformation project a reality, without aligning himself with one of the two great powers: a left wing project, democratic, peaceful and with political and press freedoms.”  On the 50th anniversary of the coup d’etat, “the mini-series aims to be a programming event, which will be broadcast on the same dates by TVN, RTVE and Canal 9, during September 2023,” Gándara said.  “We are evaluating several alternative sales agents and platforms that would launch the series after its free-to-air release,” he added.  Launched in 2001 by Gándara and Gónzález, Parox has become one of Chile’s foremost TV companies, having produced fiction series such as TVN’s sci-fi thriller “Gen Mishima” and “Invisible Heroes,” a thriller-drama set during the 1973 military coup, co-produced with Finnish public broadcaster YLE and broadcast by Chilevisión.  Further Parox standout productions take in TVN’s “El reemplazante” and “Los archivos del Cardenal,” plus local adaptations of both HBO’s “In Treatment” for 3TV and Juan José Campanella Argentine comedy “El hombre de tu vida” for Canal 13."

Keir Starmer with Andy Burnham in parliament last year.  Andy Burnham has accused Keir Starmer’s advisers of briefing against him instead of “pulling together for a Labour majority government”.  In a furious attack, the mayor of Greater Manchester blamed “unelected people in their 20s or 30s who think they know it all”.  He said he was the victim of anonymous attacks every time he tried to highlight the work he is doing in Manchester.  He told Times Radio: “Whenever I go out there with something positive, the negative Westminster briefing machine somehow flicks into gear.  “All that I’d say is leave me alone.”  Burnham, who served in government under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown when he was a Labour MP, added: “I honestly don’t know what purpose they think it serves. It would be nice to have some support from a national level.”  Burnham is a divisive figure among his former parliamentary colleagues after he refused to join the coup attempt against Jeremy Corbyn's leadership in 2016.  He has also angered many Labour MPs by repeatedly criticising Westminster, despite being a former special adviser, an MP for 17 years and a cabinet minister in three different departments.  Burnham insisted he did not blame Starmer or members of the shadow cabinet personally for the negative briefings.  He said: “I know who they are and you know who they are, the kind of people who, you know, the unelected people in their 20s or 30s who think they know it all and they’re the kind of bee’s knees. And they go around sort of briefing against elected politicians.”  Drawing parallels with the last time Labour came to power in 1997, Burnham said: “These anonymous briefers need to sort of go back to [1997] and learn from that, and make sure that as we kind of build from here we’ve got all sides of the party involved, respected and pulling together for a Labour majority government.”  Related..."

It is a completely different proposition to see that machine spring to life. When everything is clicking on a baseball team, it is a beautiful thing to behold.  The Texas Rangers made some marquee acquisitions in the off season, placing their focus squarely on the bullpen, signing Jacob deGrom, Andrew Heaney, Nathan Eovaldi, Jake Odorizzi, and re-signing Martin Pérez on a qualifying offer.  When the dust settled on free agency, the frisson in the air around Arlington was around the coup of getting former Cy Young winner deGrom. Eovaldi felt like a nice addition, rounding out the rotation, but nobody was expecting more than solid, workmanlike pitching from the former Red Sox starter.  How wrong we were.  Nathan Eovaldi has turned out to be a revelation for Texas. And in Fenway, while Xander Bogaerts’ exit was the focus of much chagrin, it may turn out to be Eovaldi as “the one that got away.”  Nathan Eovaldi has thrown 28.2 straight scoreless innings, including a near complete game with a career-high 12 strikeouts tonight pic.twitter.com/duJal4mm0w — Talkin’ Baseball (@TalkinBaseball_) May 12, 2023  While his season got off to a slow start, the last month has seen Eovaldi come to life, the gears of the machine grinding into an awe-inspiring symphony of sparks, magic, and sometimes even flames. He is currently on a run of throwing 28.2 consecutive scoreless innings, which includes three straight scoreless outings throwing eight or more innings.  Along that run, Eovaldi threw a complete game shutout against the Yankees on April 29, and he came within one out of doing the same to Oakland. In that game, the Texan notched up a career-high 12 strikeouts over 8.2 innings.  But it isn’t just the lack of scoring that is eyebrow-raising, but the manner in which they have been achieved. In eight starts this season, Eovaldi has struck out 56 batters while only walking eight. Over the last three starts he has walked just three, which puts him into an elite, albeit esoteric, club of only six players in the modern era to throw over 25 scoreless innings, while chalking up 25-plus strikeouts and allowing 3 or fewer walks over a 3-start span. Yes, that is a stat just chock-full of qualifications, but the names are what should grab your eye.  Walter Johnson (1913)  Sandy Koufax (1963)  Bob Gibson (1968)  Orel Hershiser (1984)  Clayton Kershaw (2015)  Nathan Eovaldi (2023)  Nathan Eovaldi has been unhittable over his last 3 starts for the Rangers.    3-0 Record  25.2 Innings  0.00 ERA  25 Strikeouts  3 Walks    He's been the ace of the Texas rotation with Jacob DeGrom out with injury. pic.twitter.com/4mm3nUBoFd — Thomas Carrieri (@Thomas_Carrieri) May 16, 2023  While Eovaldi’s current run of scoreless innings pitched is a long way off the MLB record of 59, held by Orel Hershiser, it is already the longest by a Ranger in the past seven years. Fans in Arlington are warming to the idea that the real coup of the off season may have been Eovaldi, while fans in Fenway are perhaps slapping their foreheads in frustration.  Having spent more than half of last season on the injured list in Boston, there is an undercurrent of concern in Bruce Bochy’s clubhouse. Eovaldi needs to be ring fenced, perhaps even protected, especially now that deGrom is out until June and on Tommy John watch.  Due to start on Wednesday against the Atlanta Braves, Nathan Eovaldi may extend that scoreless streak even further. But even if he doesn’t, he is already proving to be the key to the Texas Rangers three game lead in the AL West. As the Astros keep grinding out wins and the fortunes of the Angels fluctuate, one thing is certain in Texas: Nate Eovaldi is a keeper."

(Image: Isle of Wight Council)  One of the only airworthy Lancaster bombers still in existence will take to the skies over the Isle of Wight later this year.  The Second World War aircraft will perform a flypast to mark Isle of Wight Armed Forces Day.  It follows this week's 80-year anniversary of the famous Dambusters Raid.  Armed Forces Day committee chair and Isle of Wight Armed Forces Champion, Councillor Ian Dore, said: “This has taken six months of patience, sleepless nights and being very nice on the phone, but the hard work has paid off and we are there.  ""My pen was quivering this week as I signed off the agreement for the flypast. It was squared away a few hours before the crews would be kitting up for the famous Dambusters raid, 80 years ago.  ""You can’t help but get goose bumps. The history, the heritage, the heroism; what a feeling. In a week that has seen the anniversary of that raid, to have the paperwork dripping in ink is something of a major coup for the Island.”  Find out more about Isle of Wight Armed Forces Day and the flypast  To read more on Isle of Wight Armed Forces Day, click HERE.  Eighty years ago, on the night of 16 and 17 May 1943, Wing Commander Guy Gibson led 617 Squadron of the Royal Air Force on an audacious bombing raid, into the industrial heartland of Germany.  Operation Chastise saw 19 Lancasters, crewed by 133 airmen, attack three dams in the Ruhr Valley and history was made. Lancaster PA474 is one of only two Lancasters that are still airworthy in the world (7,377 were built).  It is flown and maintained by the RAF's Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, and will now be gracing the skies above Ryde.  Councillor Dore added: “The ‘Lanc’ is an aircraft the evokes such emotion and admiration, linking us back to past aviation and reminding us of its pivotal role in World War Two.  ""I would humbly suggest that its appearance at Armed Forces Day is made even more poignant, given that there are now no remaining members of 617 squadron alive.  Story continues  ""As it cruises aloft the glorious seafront in Ryde, respect will be paid to those that made the ultimate sacrifice, as well as to those that are serving now.  ""From my recollection, the last time the Lancaster officially displayed here, was in 2013 over Cowes, so it’s going to be something for the memory books.”  The Battle of Britain Memorial Flight plane, PA474 will be seen off Ryde Seafront as part of the Armed Forces Day event on Sunday, June 25."

On Wednesday, the man known as ‘El Loco’ did not disappoint, enchanting listeners as he was introduced as the new coach of the Uruguay national team.  More than 300 journalists were present in Montevideo to hear what Bielsa had to say about his first job since leaving Leeds United a year ago. He had a sobering message to deliver. “I think the expectations here are out of proportion,” he warned, while at the same time noting that Uruguay “can fantasise [about winning the World Cup] and have enough about them to feed that fantasy.” He also expounded upon his deep admiration for Uruguay, pointing to the time he arrived in the nation's capital to spend a romantic weekend away with his wife and ended up staying two months. A positive start, then, and if he can keep it up both on and off the pitch there is no reason why Bielsa cannot join the great José ‘Pepe’ Mujica as Uruguay's most beloved eccentric, somewhat grouchy old men.  The appointment of the Rosario native is clearly a coup for the Celeste, who are looking to overhaul a team long on talent but which has let itself down through timid play across the last decade under Óscar Tábarez and Diego Alonso. The World Cup in Qatar demonstrated the Uruguay with eloquence: equipped with the players to unveil an expansive, intense attacking game the nation instead retreated back into its spiky shell, relying on the myth of the hard-tackling Garra Charrúa and crashing out with a whimper in the first round.  Bielsa at least has the knowledge and personality to drag Uruguay into this century, though it remains to be seen how he takes to international coaching a full 13 years after bringing an end to his extremely fruitful partnership with Chile. On a wider note, his appointment continues a startling domination of CONMEBOL benches on the part of the reigning World Cup champions. No fewer than seven of the confederation's 10 members boast an Argentine as head coach, a number that could be even higher had Gustavo Alfaro and Ricardo Gareca not walked out on Ecuador and Peru respectively towards the end of 2022. And there is still one job open: could Brazil take the plunge on a neighbour and make it a crazy eight?  A foot in both camps  Indeed, ignoring Argentine dominance of the world game just keeps getting harder. Saturday sees Javier Mascherano begin his do-over at the Under-20 helm as they kick off the World Cup in Santiago del Estero against mysterious Uzbekistan, the start of three weeks of elite youth football across the nation.  Only slightly older, Lautaro Martínez and Julián Álvarez are also flying the flag. Both World Cup winners found the net midweek to send Inter and Manchester City through to the Champions League final, to be played next month in Istanbul. And because absolutely everything here is black and white, debate has begun in earnest over which brilliant young striker is more brilliant than the other. Julián has proved a sparkling addition to City's already shining all-star team, adapting with ease to the English and European game; while so important has Lautaro been to Inter's fortunes that it is hard to see them anywhere near this showpiece game without his all-round talents and (notoriously absent in Qatar but now back with a vengeance) knack for finding the net.  In summary, this column holds both aces in the highest esteem and, rear end planted firmly on the fence, hopes they can both impress in Istanbul – while the real winner is none other than Lionel Scaloni and his embarrassment of riches at centre-forward."

Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine. ArrowRight War engulfed the African nation April 14 and shows little sign of abating after more than 1 million people fled their homes. Both the military and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have repeatedly pledged to respect cease-fires and humanitarian law, only to break those promises within minutes. Each side blames the other for sparking and continuing hostilities.  Many Sudanese resist calling the conflict a civil war, pointing out that neither side enjoys wide public support. Instead, they describe it as a naked power struggle between the two men who jointly directed a 2021 coup against a civilian-military government. Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan is the head of the military and the de facto head of state, and Gen. Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo — known as Hemedti — commands the powerful RSF.  In the country’s capital, Khartoum, and elsewhere, the RSF has taken up positions inside civilian homes, hospitals and even churches. Residents blame the RSF for widespread looting, several rapes and forced evictions into streets under crossfire. Social media is alight with images of military airstrikes pummeling the capital and accounts of families pulverized by heavy weapons.  Advertisement  As bombs rained down on hospitals and aid workers fled, civilians revived the neighborhood resistance committees that helped force a dictator from power in 2019 and ensured that the civilians had a place in the government. The committees document attacks, set up rudimentary clinics and try to pool resources such as water and safe housing for those fleeing the fighting. Now those activists are being targeted, some residents said.  Three days ago, the military arrested three activists from the resistance committee in Bahri, the town just north of Khartoum, said Mustafa Makki, who worked alongside them. All three are young: Saddam Juma is 29, while Amer Abboud and Mujahid Anwar are both 27, he said.  The reason for their arrests is unclear, but all were taken from their homes May 14 by uniformed military forces in marked vehicles, he said. They are being held in the Kadro area, north of Bahri, now the site of a major firefight, Makki said.  Advertisement  “We don’t know why they were arrested,” he said. “We don’t support either side, not the military or the RSF.” A second member of the committee confirmed his account.  It was the second time that activists from the Bahri committee have been targeted. Last week, the military arrested two other activists from Bahri and held them for 48 hours. The military’s spokesman was unreachable for comment.  The neighborhood is largely under the control of the RSF, but fierce battles have raged there every day. Its industrial area houses a munitions factory and is the target of frequent battles and airstrikes.  Doctors at Bahri’s Globe Hospital and Hag al-Safi Hospital have also been repeatedly taken against their will and forced to treat RSF fighters, Makki said. Only about 16 percent of the capital’s hospitals are still functioning; many have lost power or water, run out of supplies or been hit by shelling.  Advertisement  “The RSF come, and the doctors say: ‘We have wounded civilians here. Let us treat them first,’” Makki said. “But the RSF said no, we must be first.”  A member of the Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, said she and the other doctors on the committee have received death threats. Many fled, and others stopped going to work, changed their numbers and went into hiding, she said. At least 11 doctors have been killed; one was stabbed, and others were killed in crossfire or when their homes were hit.  She said the threats appeared to come from people connected to former president Omar Hassan al-Bashir, who was forced out of office in 2019 following massive street protests. The doctor told The Washington Post, “The purpose of this threat is to end all the tools of the revolution, including resistance committees and trade unions, so that they do not continue their civil struggle.”  Advertisement  On Wednesday, the U.N. humanitarian office in Geneva said 25 million people, more than half of Sudan’s population, need help. That is 10 million more than before the fighting started and the highest number ever recorded for the country. The office called for $2.6 billion in aid from the international community.  The rival sides are holding talks in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, with little apparent progress. They have issued statements saying they will protect civilians and allow aid to move, but no details have been given, and the fighting has continued unabated.  On Monday, the Professional Pharmacists Association of Sudan accused the RSF of hijacking a convoy of medical supplies headed to regional hospitals, which have also been hit hard by the fighting.  The group’s statement called the theft of supplies “a death sentence for the residents of the regions,” noting that 95 percent of all pharmaceutical production takes place in the capital. About 830,000 people fleeing the fighting have gone to other towns within Sudan and about 220,000 to neighboring countries, the United Nations said Wednesday.  Community leaders have also been targeted in the city of Geneina in the western region of Darfur, said an activist there, who listed their names in a message: Mahamed Badwi, an engineer, activist and writer; Motaz Abujalli, a journalist and human rights activist; and Adam Taiar, an activist and member of the medical committee. All were killed April 24, he said, by militias aligned with the RSF that went to their homes. The activist spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.  Advertisement  The activist said the militias — referred to locally as the Janjaweed, or “devils on horseback” — were carrying out ethnic killings and have also looted and burned the palace of the sultan of the Masalit tribe. The Janjaweed are ethnically Arab militias; the Masalit are a local African tribe that fought the central government and the Janjaweed for nearly 20 years until a peace deal three years ago.  “Janjaweed militia and RSF are using [gunmen] to shoot people who have influence like leaders, intellectuals and professionals,” the activist wrote, saying it was too dangerous to go home. The phone network was too weak to support calls, so he texted quick answers to questions. “No way to get out of the town … two days I haven’t met my family … even my young brother injured today … most of my friends were killed … I have no doubt I will be killed by them.”  The death toll in the town as of this past Friday was 556, he said, citing a list kept by clinics. On Tuesday, seven members of one family were killed when the RSF fired heavy weapons into a civilian area.  Lt. Gen. Khamis Abdullah Abkar, the governor of West Darfur, confirmed that more than 500 people have been killed in Geneina since the fighting erupted and that militia members were going house to house in some areas looking for individuals. The hospital was not functioning, and hundreds of wounded people needed urgent medical care, but there was no way to take them to help, he said.  GiftOutline Gift Article"

The Catalans hope to bring Lionel Messi back to the club from PSG but also need to register new contracts for key players such as Ronald Araujo and Gavi. Barca also need to cut costs to comply with Financial Fair Play but have seen an initial feasibility plan rejected by La Liga ahead of the opening of the transfer window.  AND WHAT'S MORE: Alemany's decision will also be a setback for Villa who looked to have pulled off something of a coup by landing the Barca chief. The Premier League side had hoped Alemany could help pull off a move for Real Madrid's Marco Asensio but must now rethink their plans ahead of the summer.

The commitments include $2 billion in incentives to accelerate the manufacture and export of renewable hydrogen gas and $80.5 million in program support to attract and monitor foreign investment in Australia’s diversifying critical minerals sector. These measures highlight the importance of striking the right balance between industry growth and international engagement.  The budget has been criticised for its lack of further funding for climate support in the Pacific. The Australian Defence Force will share in a $1.4 billion package to bolster cooperation with Pacific island countries on security infrastructure, maritime security, law enforcement and criminal justice. Only modest amounts will be spent on improving regional architecture and humanitarian relief and disaster preparedness. This suggests that there’s more work to be done as Australia looks to increase its international energy competitiveness and address the threats posed by climate change and other emerging security issues.  Democracy watch  Thailand’s election produced a strong expression of voter discontent reflecting a widespread yearning for change and raising questions about the willingness of the military-backed establishment to embrace the sentiment. The election outcome was a political earthquake as prodemocracy parties triumphed over their military-backed counterparts, with the progressive Move Forward party leading the pack. The party campaigned on the once-taboo topic of monarchy reform, a bold move in a country with a strict lèse-majesté law.  Given the military’s substantial influence and historical involvement in political affairs, including coups, any interference carries the risk of street violence and instability. The election outcome was a blow to Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha, a former coup leader whose popularity has declined.  Despite Move Forward’s clear majority, the presence of military-appointed senators in the electoral process could hinder the formation of a coalition government. The opposition is confronted with multiple challenges, including the undemocratic framing of the constitution, the need to form a democratic coalition, and the looming possibility of legal action to invalidate the election results.  Information operations  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan used a 14-second clip during a rally to accuse his rival, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, of colluding with Kurdish militants. The video purportedly showed Kilicdaroglu rallying his supporters alongside apparent members of the banned PKK. However, it was later revealed that the video was a skilfully edited montage, part of the disinformation campaign that has plagued this crucial election. In response, Kilicdaroglu, running closely with Erdogan, claimed that foreign hackers recruited by Erdogan’s team were preparing deepfakes and manipulated videos to discredit adversaries before the election.  This election has witnessed the weaponisation of misinformation propagated on social media platforms and counterfeit campaign materials. While the country has enacted legislation criminalising the dissemination of fake news, the government hasn’t enforced it during the electoral process. The disinformation campaign has intensified polarisation but it is considered unlikely to significantly sway the outcome. The extent of international involvement in spreading disinformation remains uncertain, with local political factions primarily responsible.  Follow the money  China and Pakistan have agreed to extend the Belt and Road initiative to Afghanistan. The decision to include Afghanistan in the multibillion-dollar project and to extend the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor to it, was included in broader commitments to expand trilateral contribution to boost Afghanistan’s reconstruction.  The BRI’s extension is a win for the Taliban, who have expressed their wish to be included, as they struggle to govern a cash-strapped nation and meet its infrastructure needs. Afghanistan’s central bank’s reserves of US$9 billion have been frozen since 2021. Meanwhile, the UN has estimated that US$4.6 billion is needed to alleviate the dire humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in the nation.  As other countries continue to debate whether to engage with the Taliban, China is swiftly moving to fill a gap left by nations once heavily involved in Afghanistan’s reconstruction. Earlier this year, the Taliban signed an oil-extraction contract with a subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corporation, and other Chinese firms have expressed an interest in investing in the country’s mineral resources, worth an estimated US$1 trillion.  Terror byte  France’s parliament has unanimously passed a non-binding resolution intended to encourage the European Union to register Russia’s Wagner Group on its list of terrorist organisations. In a speech to parliament last week supporting the resolution, MP Benjamin Haddad argued that Wagner wasn’t driven by financial motivations and instead followed ‘a broad strategy, from Mali to Ukraine, of supporting the aggressive policies of President [Vladimir] Putin’s regime’.  The EU’s terrorist list, which is approved by leaders of member countries at regular meetings, comprises 13 people and 21 groups or entities including al-Qaeda and Islamic State. The addition of Wagner Group to the list would allow EU countries to freeze its assets and those of its members. European countries and their citizens would be barred from dealing with the group. Aside from France, the parliaments of Lithuania and Estonia have similarly labelled Wagner a terrorist organisation, and the British government is reportedly planning to follow suit."

Since the military seized power and jailed democratic leaders, some opponents of military rule have taken up arms, in places joining ethnic minority insurgents, and the military has responded with air strikes and heavy weapons, including in civilian areas.  Russian-made Mi-35 helicopter, MiG-29 fighter jets and Yak-130 light aircraft, and Chinese K-8 jets, have been most frequently used to conduct air strikes that have hit schools, medical facilities, homes and other civilian sites, said the report by Tom Andrews, the UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in Myanmar.  In a single attack on a village gathering organized by the military's opponents in Sagaing region on April 11, two bombs dropped from a Yak-130 killed at least 160 people, reportedly including nearly 40 children, the report said.  Myanmar’s military says it is targeting insurgents and after the Sagaing attack said any civilians killed were probably supporters of opponents it calls ""terrorists.""  “The good news is we now know who is supplying these arms and the jurisdictions in which they operate,” Andrews said in a statement, calling for UN members to “step up and stop the flow of arms” with a complete ban on the arms transfers to Myanmar’s military, enforcement of existing bans and coordinated sanctions.  The UN expert used trade data to detail transfers of arms and other goods, including raw materials for Myanmar’s domestic arms production, to the military since the coup worth $406 million from Russia and $267 million from China, including from state-owned entities in both countries.  State-owned entities in India also made a smaller volume of transfers, and companies in Singapore, India and Thailand were also involved in transfers to the military.  Some $227 million of material came from Rosoboronexport, Moscow’s state-owned arms exporter, which has transferred SU-30 fighter jets, supplies for MiG-29 jets and rocket launch systems to Myanmar, the report said.  Other Russian companies provided a range of tools, equipment and spare parts for Russian-supplied weapons systems, it said.  “Weaponry provided by Russian suppliers has been used to commit probable war crimes and crimes against humanity in Myanmar,” the report said.  The UN missions of the five countries mentioned in the report as sources of arms and material did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  At a news conference in New York, Andrews said Chinese officials had earlier criticized his reporting, saying he was vilifying legitimate trade in arms and operating outside his mandate by conducting analysis. Russian officials had expressed a similar response, Andrews said.  (Reporting by Simon Lewis; Editing by Daniel Wallis)"

They know better than anyone how to create drama because drama boosts ratings, while difficult questions lower them. They portrayed the bombing of Gaza as a battle between giants, as war straight out of Hollywood. Hercules vs. Godzilla. The next minute, they would scream that it was a war of the few against the many (and guess who we are). The bombing of Gaza was covered as if it were the Battle of Stalingrad.

Not just last week but over the past 20 years, how is it that we have been destroying and killing without changing the power relations between the sides?  They also needed to ask: How is it that the citizens of a modern country have to go down into shelters once a year in submission, in resignation, without complaint, as if it is self-evident that life is a long war with cease-fires in between? How were we sold on the idea that there is “no solution”? How does the world’s most moral army always succeed in killing women and children? It’s not just that these trivial questions aren’t answered, they’re never asked.  In the face of this silence, the protest movement arose. The “judicial coup” was the straw that broke the camel’s back. It alone was not the straw, nor was it the war in Gaza, nor the millions to the Haredi parasites, nor the rising prices, but the convergence of all these and the lies they brought along.  The lies are the bad cholesterol that accumulates on the walls of the blood vessels, they are the fat cells that clog the arteries. The Haredi, ultranationalist and criminal cells – all of them are related, the occupation to the corruption and the corruption to the extreme nationalism. Eliminate one and others develop. The lying cells never die, they just keep multiplying.  When the lies keep accumulating, the arteries become blocked, perspiration increases and breath becomes short. These are lies that were told to us and that we told ourselves. The lie that “we can manage the conflict,” the lie that “the Haredim will be integrated,” the lie that “the people should choose their judges,” the lie of a “united Jerusalem” and the lie that “if we talk we’ll reach an agreement.” We won’t. Agreements can only be reached with solidarity. But our solidarity has disintegrated into loathing and disgust, each of us with our brand of disgust – with the occupation, with the Haredim, with the Ashkenazim/Mizrahim. Only the feeling that everything stinks is what unites us – along with the idea that what was will never be again.  Even if there was once a strong sense of solidarity here, it will never return. Without it, there will be no equality – not in the army, not in the economy and not in education. There is no “partial justice” and no “judicial balance.” The divisive genie that wiped out solidarity cannot be put back in the bottle. The greedy, lying leader who took him out cannot be returned to Caesarea. The division of Israel into sectors and tribes is a fact. The property tax fund suits the kind of society that no longer exists here.  A divided society had to find a way to live together with the recognition that it is made up of differing components. We can’t live apart, but we can learn to live side by side. The government must provide basic services to all, nothing more. The secular will no longer fund the ultra-Orthodox, the left will no longer defend the settlers. The Haredim won’t “kosher” electricity? Then they can pay for it. Rockets fall on Sderot? That’s their problem. Rockets fall on Tel Aviv? That’s our problem. The mayor of Sderot longs for the days of Operation Protective Edge? Let him find the 74 young people who paid with their lives in defense of his city.  The protests emerged because the sense of revulsion had reached its limit. We are fed up with the situation, with the corrupt government, with an opposition that is out of touch. We are likewise tired of the self-righteous protest movement that takes upon itself, instead of the government, the responsibility for the safety of the demonstrators. We are tired of a movement that in its effort to ensure diversity and inclusion does not know what they want, or does know but is afraid to admit it – that it wants to get Bibi out of our lives. And, to remove any doubt, as soon as possible, in the most democratic, most legal, most Jewish way possible, but to get rid of him."

Youssef Chelbi and Dhia Nsir had posted a clip on Tik Tok and Facebook this week showing them laughing and singing a sarcastic song criticizing the police's treatment of detainees and a drugs law.  Lawyer Imen Souissi said they are facing charges of insulting others through social networks and they could face up to a year in prison if the court finds them guilty. Police and the interior ministry were not immediately available for comment.  The arrest of the two men drew concern from activists and bloggers, who republished the song to show solidarity with them. Activists said that freedoms has become besieged and that Tunisia has become a large prison.  Freedom of speech and media was a key gain for Tunisians after the 2011 revolution that ended the rule of former President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and triggered the Arab Spring protests.  Saied, who shut down parliament in 2021, and seized all powers, pledged to protect rights and freedoms and said he would not be a dictator.  But his opponents, who described his moves as a coup, said that he had established one-man rule, imprisoned his opponents, and suppressed critical voices.  On Tuesday, an appeals court sentenced a radio journalist to five years in prison for disclosing information about the security services.  The main journalists union criticized the ruling and said that it is the most severe sentence against a journalist in Tunisia history and did not happen even during the most dictatorial periods in Tunisia. The verdict was a message to silence journalists, it said.  This year, police have arrested several prominent opposition leaders on charges of plotting against state security, a move the opposition described as consolidating a dictatorial regime.  Saeid rejected the criticism, saying that they are criminals and terrorists. A judge on Monday sentenced opposition leader Rached Ghannouchi to a year in prison on charges of incitement.

Just a few years ago, Sudan was considered a hybrid regime — a country that holds elections yet has strong autocratic characteristics. As recently as 2018, both Sudan and Zambia were hybrid regimes (although Sudan was certainly more authoritarian than Zambia), but the two countries took very different paths. In Sudan, under former President Omar al-Bashir, elections were not a legitimate avenue for the expression of the will of the people, and change only came through revolution. Even then, hopes for reform were dashed though a subsequent military coup, a troubled transition, and now the outbreak of war. In Zambia, by contrast, elections in 2021 provided an avenue for reform and democratic consolidation. Sudan, now a closed autocracy, holds little prospect for democratic reform. Zambia, now considered as having the potential to be a bright spot in democratic advancement, illustrates the hope that reform is possible in mixed democratic-autocratic systems.  Hybrid regimes, also known as “electoral autocracies,” are governments that endeavor to be seen as democracies but lack the fundamentals to warrant such a label. They hold elections but the playing field is rarely level, as ruling parties utilize a diversified portfolio of election manipulation tactics to secure power, including corrupted voter registration systems, intentional logistical delays, targeted violence, strategic results tampering, and compromised electoral management bodies.  Hybrid regimes pose a thorny policy challenge to the United States. In 2022, almost one-half of countries globally (72 in total) met the definition of “hybrid” or “electoral autocracy” and were present in every geographic region. Examples include Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Nigeria, Mexico, El Salvador, Egypt, Turkey, Iraq, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and the Philippines.  Unfortunately, since these governments hold elections and display other trappings of democracy, some policymakers give them a pass on their democratic track record -– especially if the country is relevant to other American interests.  This is short-sighted and counterproductive, even –- and especially — for U.S. national security. Consider the case of Egypt: despite receiving billions in U.S. security assistance, the Egyptian government has been offering to sell arms to Russia to aid the Kremlin’s illegal war in Ukraine, in direct conflict with American policies. It is also exceedingly difficult, if not dangerous, for U.S. companies to invest in or access the markets of hybrid regimes. The opaque and compromised nature of institutions common to these States often results in unclear or biased regulation. For example, while Nigeria has the fastest-growing population in Africa and a market ripe for U.S. exports, corruption and biased regulation make it difficult for U.S. companies to operate there.  Failing to address the democratic deficiencies of hybrid regimes sets up the United States for long-term strategic failure and hinders American economic prosperity. To avoid these outcomes, the United States must carve out a new path forward that preserves near-term U.S. interests while also pressing these States to make democratic progress. After all, there is hope for hybrid regimes. As a recent study notes, “In the face of the global wave of autocratization, data shows that no less than eight countries are bouncing back and making U-turns … Cases like these raise some hope for a future reversal of the last 20 years’ downward trend towards autocratization.”  Thwarting US Interests  Hybrid regimes are less likely to uphold the interests of the United States and its democratic allies on the world stage. Of the 72 hybrid regimes, only 20 voted to remove Russia from the U.N. Human Rights Council in April 2022 over the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Of the countries who joined with the United States in a U.N. General Assembly committee to condemn China’s human rights abuses in Xinjiang in October 2022, only four were hybrid regimes.  Hybrid regimes also are more prone to internal conflict and instability because they often lack legitimacy among politically marginalized groups (and sometimes large swaths of the population). They are ill-equipped to effectively handle security challenges –- often resorting to heavy-handed tactics that inflame violence –- and have weak institutions that are unable to challenge abuses of executive power.  The susceptibility of hybrid regimes to political violence and instability is perhaps most acute in sub-Saharan Africa. According to an analysis of 2022 data, hybrid regimes experienced almost three times as many conflict incidents and five times as many conflict fatalities compared to stronger democracies. Analysis of data for the past decade shows that hybrid regimes in sub-Saharan Africa are seven times as likely to experience a coup or attempted coup compared to democracies.  The Flawed Approach to Hybrid Regimes  As the United States increasingly engages in strategic competition with China and its authoritarian model, it must remember that it is free people and democratic societies who are its most valuable allies on the global stage. Premature acceptance of sub-standard elections and willful ignorance of democratic backsliding may provide short-term bilateral gains, but in the long term serves to further separate the people in these countries from the United States, eroding affinity between our peoples, and increasing risks of conflict and instability that weaken current and future allies.  It’s important to note the distinctions between hybrid regimes and authoritarian regimes, which do not hold plausibly competitive elections (if they hold elections at all) for the chief executive and the legislature and where institutions have little-to-no ability to check the power of the executive. This distinction enables the international community to minimize the democratic failures of hybrid regimes.  An example is the tendency to judge elections in hybrid regimes as “good enough” unless the fraud and violence are egregiously obvious. In February, the U.S. State Department rushed to congratulate the declared winner of Nigeria’s 2023 presidential election, even though the election was widely criticized by observers for targeted violence, lack of transparency, significant voter disenfranchisement, and outright vote manipulation in some states.  The United States has applied this low bar in other recent elections. Angola’s August 2022 presidential election saw the half-century rule of the MPLA party extended by another five years, in an election where the ruling party controlled the media and courts, imposed worrying changes to the vote-tabulation process, and heavily obstructed efforts to observe the election. Despite these red flags, the U.S. Embassy quickly congratulated the declared winner and commended “the millions of Angolan voters who cast their ballots in this election, and in doing so demonstrated their commitment to strengthening democracy.” Following Tunisia’s December 2022 parliamentary elections, which some international observers labeled a “sham,” the State Department issued a vanilla statement, noting low turnout and the need for greater political inclusion, but failing to cite any other major issues that impeded the credibility of the process, such as barriers to political party participation and egregious restrictions on the press.  Such omissions have immediate and direct consequences for U.S. security and economic interests. For instance, in Nigeria, the widely disputed election results and the high levels of regional disenfranchisement of voters will likely compound regional and sectarian grievances, fueling increased conflict and destabilization, and diverting even more resources and attention of the United States and like-minded partners to combat instability. And in Angola, the extension of MPLA rule under questionable circumstances could lead to continued democratic backsliding and undermine prospects for economic reform, harming U.S. economic interests, including trade (already in significant decline), and could make the country more vulnerable to the malign influence of Russia and China.  Sadly, hybrid regimes most often result from democratic backsliding, rather than autocracies moving toward democratic reform. Of today’s 72 hybrid regimes, 20 were considered stronger democracies 20 years ago, while eight were considered closed autocracies.  Democratic backsliding is usually a gradual process. The international community’s muted response to closing space in hybrid regimes tends to facilitate continued backsliding. Over the past five years, there has been a worrying global increase in the number of authoritarian regimes. This suggests that early action to address the democratic deficiencies of hybrid regimes is critical to forestalling autocratic consolidation.  Failing to make the distinction between hybrid regimes and democracies, and failure to comprehend trajectories of democratic backsliding, undermines the intent of democratic initiatives like the Biden administration’s Summit for Democracy. At the most recent summit, countries that have been experiencing years of democratic backsliding and refuse to publicize their commitments to democracy (such as Nigeria and Philippines) are given equal standing with countries that are actively and transparently consolidating democracy. Of the 120 countries invited to participate in the 2023 Summit for Democracy, 25 were hybrid regimes. Only about half of these countries publicized their commitments from the summit. And of the stronger democracies invited, almost 40 are countries that experienced notable democratic backsliding over the past five years and are at increasing risk of becoming hybrid regimes this decade.  Democracies are not only more stable than hybrid regimes, but they also enjoy better economic growth, equality, and educational achievement. The failure to adequately differentiate hybrid regimes from stronger democracies fuels the counterproductive perception that “democracy fails to deliver,” when it is in fact the failure to achieve meaningful democracy that prevents so much of the world from enjoying its dividends.  Walking and Chewing Gum at the Same Time  The United States and allies must balance their cooperation with hybrid regimes, when it is necessary at all, with a push for those governments to reform and realize broader democratic progress. These aims are not contradictory, but complementary and central to advancing U.S. objectives. Achieving this balance will require prioritizing respect for democratic practices, institutions, and norms when determining how to engage hybrid regimes. Democracy will not always trump other factors, but it should be moved up the rank order of priorities.  There are practical steps the United States and like-minded allies can take -– using diplomacy and foreign assistance -– to advance near-term pressing issues while targeting democratic deficiencies that make hybrid regimes problematic for American interests.  For instance, the United States and G7 allies should make clear they will not welcome with open arms leaders chosen through dubious, sub-standard elections. From Washington to London, leaders should get serious about issuing public sanctions, including asset freezes and visa bans, for malfeasance during elections. On the flip side, the U.S. and allies should make better use of high-level diplomatic engagement, such as leveraging the legitimacy conferred by Cabinet-level visits, to incentivize governments to make changes and adhere to international democratic best practices.  These steps can be impactful while not undercutting cooperation on pressing matters. In Nigeria, for instance, the United States can engage the government to achieve priorities via the U.S. Ambassador and U.S.-Nigeria Binational Commission (BNC), a forum established in 2010 to discuss a range of interests. The Secretary of State need not make plans to visit Abuja to meet newly elected President Bola Tinubu while key court decisions -– and a potential independent audit -– are pending on the results of the recent election.  The United States and G7 allies should pay more rigorous attention to elections in general. Rather than accepting elections as a continuation of the status quo, the West should view electoral processes as critical moments to correct or continue countries’ democratic trajectories, and apply commensurate attention, pressure, and incentives. One step in the right direction would be to more explicitly and publicly link future foreign aid funding used to support elections in such countries to recipient governments agreeing to abide by established electoral standards, including enforcement of election law, equitable access to voting, and transparency in reporting election results and election data. Failure to link foreign assistance to meaningful reforms results not only in sub-par elections and wasted U.S. taxpayer dollars, but also provides diplomatic cover for election malpractice and malfeasance.  Foreign aid has an important role to play in advancing U.S. interests in hybrid regimes by helping cultivate and reinforce democratic practices and norms outside a government in power. The United States is therefore smart to invest in civil society-led advocacy campaigns that hold leaders accountable and in efforts to strengthen political parties that can contest elections and offer an alternative to the status quo. Yet the United States can do more to couple such capacity building via foreign aid with creating the political will for reform. While building democratic capacity can incentivize and enable the will to reform, capacity should not be viewed as an end in itself; this is a convenient, but short-sighted and counterproductive, approach. Diplomacy and foreign assistance can help enable this political will through a combination of incentives, pressure, and advocacy campaigns, as well as identifying and equipping rising political stars unafraid to push for change.  Looking Forward  As the U.S. and allies navigate relations with hybrid regimes, they should approach evaluating a country’s democratic performance as science and not art. Objective third-party evaluations of democratic performance are widely available but largely ignored in U.S. policymaking. Robust and credible civil society organizations proliferate in many hybrid regimes; yet despite many of these organizations receiving assistance from the United States, their warnings about democratic backsliding are regularly disregarded. The United States should pair support to these organizations with listening to their perspectives -– to the extent they reflect the people’s perceptions and expectations of democracy -– and account for their views in the policymaking process.  U.S. officials must resist the convenient but inaccurate narrative that the hybrid regimes of the world are slowly but surely moving in the right direction. Evidence of backsliding in the past 10 years has shown that is far from certain. A narrative of wishful thinking only results in misleading analysis and poorly targeted foreign assistance and diplomacy, serving to reinforce one-party rule and compound public grievances around the world. Using rigorous metrics can help make progress in this area.  Major policy initiatives like the Summit for Democracy should require concrete commitments from all participants and demonstrable democratic progress against these commitments. These initiatives should include public accountability for democratic backsliding and for failure to achieve reform objectives. At minimum, governments on prior Summit invite lists who go on to enable backsliding should not be included moving forward.  Ideally, the United States should reward allies that make tangible democratic advances with tangible benefits. For example, the United States should consider re-initiating free-trade agreement discussions with Ecuador if President Guillermo Lasso’s government makes progress on anti-corruption and continues to consolidate democracy. Doing so would reward a key ally in the region and one of the remaining democratic bright spots with tangible changes that benefit the Ecuadorian people and U.S. interests. Similar carrots could be held out for progress in a range of other contexts as well. Participants should also commit to stand with democracy against autocracy on the world stage. Mitigating democratic backsliding and combatting authoritarianism requires the concerted efforts of a global community.  With major elections coming up in several hybrid regimes this year and next — including Turkey’s planned runoff election on May 28, as well as balloting in DRC, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Algeria, Egypt, Tunisia, Mexico, and El Salvador — the United States must think carefully about how it will assess and react to these elections, and whether perceived short-term bilateral gains will truly be worth the long-term costs.  Going forward, while it is important for the United States to shore up its alliances with the Philippines and other partners to thwart China’s malign influence and kinetic threat, U.S. leaders also must be acutely aware of the democratic backsliding that is occurring in these hybrid regimes and use American leverage to counter it. Without such clear accountability and seriousness in upholding of democratic values, the United States can expect to have “allies” and “partners” that are not only less free and stable, but also distinctly unreliable.

Graeme Murdoch, chairman of the Food Crop Contractors Association (FCCA), made up of commodity traders, offtakers and millers who have been funding the production of crops since 2020, told Reuters private traders would increase their activity.  ""The reality is that as the environment becomes more liberalised, and the government makes every effort to essentially crowd in the private sector, which they have done more and more both in terms of the financing and regulation, we see more and more involvement of the private sector in primary agriculture,"" he said in an interview.  About 76% of the planned 2023 wheat hectarage would be funded by the private sector, including the country's biggest bank CBZ Holdings (CBZ.ZI) and the state-owned AFC Commercial Bank, Murdoch said.  The balance will be funded directly by the government through its various input support schemes as well as some self-financing farmers.  Zimbabwe has frequently struggled to feed itself since 2000, when then-president Robert Mugabe championed the seizure of white-owned farms to resettle landless Blacks.  Food production plummeted due to the exodus of skilled farmers and a lack of funding for those newly resettled. The conversion of most farms into state land left the cash-strapped government struggling as the biggest funder of food crops.  President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who replaced Mugabe in a 2017 coup, has gradually opened the door for the private sector, including banks, to fund the production of staples such as maize, wheat and soyabeans.  The government has also ended the monopoly of the state-owned Grain Marketing Board (GMB) as the sole purchaser of maize and wheat.  After a record-breaking harvest of 375,131 tonnes of wheat in 2022, the government is targeting 408,000 tonnes this year.  Private firms under the FCCA spent $62.7 million to fund the production of 209,138 tonnes of maize, about 9% of this year's total maize harvest of 2.3 million tonnes, according to government data. Zimbabwe's 2023 maize harvest is a 58% increase on the previous season's haul.

A “treasonous charade,” former President Donald Trump declared. “Who should go to jail?” demanded Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga.  A report by special counsel John Durham on the origins of the FBI’s investigation into the Trump campaign’s work with Russia recommended no further prosecutions, produced no startling revelations and declined to suggest any “wholesale changes” to FBI rules for politically sensitive investigations.  ADVERTISING  Durham’s prosecutorial powers led to two minor criminal cases, both of which ended in acquittal. A former FBI lawyer pleaded guilty to altering an email to help prepare a wiretap application.  Yet the former president and his allies in the conservative media bubble and in Congress found in Durham’s 306-page report what they needed. In their view, the contents amplify a long-held position that the FBI’s investigation into Russia’s intervention in the 2016 election, known as Crossfire Hurricane — and the Trump campaign’s active or passive abetting of it — was a political vendetta concocted by Hillary Rodham Clinton and her willing accomplices in federal law enforcement.  No court cases or indictments will advance such claims. But the Republican interpretation of the final Durham report will feed a narrative of “deep state” corruption that is fueling not only Trump’s quest for the White House in 2024 but also that of many of his rivals for the Republican nomination. The vilification of federal bureaucracy was already an emerging theme in the fight to be the Republican standard-bearer. Regardless of Durham’s actual conclusions, his report appears to serve that theme.  Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, Trump’s closest competitor in the still-early Republican primary race, promised Monday “to clean house” at “weaponized federal agencies,” which he said had “manufactured a false conspiracy theory.”  “Heads need to roll,” said another competitor, former Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina.  Trump had termed the Russia investigation “the crime of the century,” and with no one doing time for that crime, the Durham report could still prove to be Exhibit A in how the American right seems to be living in its own universe — and how Trump still dictates the parameters of that separate reality.  On his Truth Social website, Trump said the special prosecutor had concluded that “the FBI should never have launched the Trump-Russia Probe!”  In fact, Durham said he agreed that the FBI should have opened a preliminary investigation.  “I, and much more importantly, the American public have been victims of this long-running and treasonous charade started by the Democrats — started by Comey,” Trump told Fox News Digital. “There must be a heavy price to pay for putting our country through this.”  Repeated fundraising emails from Trump were headlined “I WAS FRAMED.”  The conservative website The Federalist picked up the cudgel, attacking The New York Times’ initial coverage of contacts between Russian intelligence officials and associates of Trump, reporting that earned the Times a Pulitzer Prize.  And on Twitter, Trump’s most reliable allies in Congress framed the final report as explosive and groundbreaking, the opposite conclusion of mainstream media outlets. Durham may have pursued no major prosecutions, but Republicans demanded them.  “Democrats attempted a coup against President Trump with their ‘Russia Russia Russia’ hoax,” wrote Greene.  Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., urged her supporters to “get active” and “fight to make things better.”  “Let this be your wake-up call: they’re trying to take our country away from us,” she wrote on Twitter.  Others who piled on included Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, the House Republican Conference chair; commentator Ben Shapiro; and Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla. Conservative media outlets such as The New York Post and Breitbart weighed in, implicating Clinton, President Joe Biden, former President Barack Obama and a vast cast of Democrats in what Breitbart called the “collusion hoax.”  “Shut down the FBI,” said entrepreneur and Republican candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, who has made castigation of the “administrative state” central to his campaign."

Police charged the girl in the northern province of Phitsanulok on Monday with violating the lese majeste law and the Computer Crime Act, according to a statement from Thai Lawyers for Human Rights, a legal advocacy group. It said on Wednesday that police originally summoned her in 2021 when she was 14 years old, which appears to make her the youngest person in Thailand to face the charge.  The lese majeste law, also known as Article 112 of Thailand’s Criminal Code, makes insulting the monarch, his immediate family and the regent punishable by three to 15 years in prison.  It has long been controversial, especially because anyone, not just the royal family, can file a complaint with police. Critics say the law is often used as a tool to quash political dissent, and point to the many arrests of pro-democracy protesters by the government of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha.  The subject became an issue in Sunday's general election, in which the two top opposition vote-getting parties had acknowledged the need to consider changes to the law. Conservative-leaning parties, which have ruled Thailand since a 2014 coup, are in favor of maintaining it.  The top-ranked Move Forward Party, which has been more forthright in calling for reforms, has proposed an amendment to reduce the punishment. Its stand is seen by conservatives as radical, and may jeopardize its chances of forming a government when Parliament meets in July to select a new prime minister.  Devotion to the monarchy has long been a pillar of Thai society, and until recent years, the institution was considered untouchable. But sharp political schisms that began appearing two decades ago affected its reputation, particularly among young people seeking change.  The girl charged Monday denied all charges and was granted bail by the provincial juvenile court, according to Thai Lawyers for Human Rights. It said the police initially decided not to press charges against her, but were later instructed to do so by the local prosecutors. The Associated Press is not naming her because she's a minor.  At least 244 people have been charged with lese majeste in 264 cases since November 2020, when Prayuth’s government was facing street protests by student-led groups seeking greater democracy, including reforms of the monarchy.  At least 19 minors have been accused of the offense in that period, including four who were younger than 15 years, the lawyers group said.  In March, a 15-year-old girl was arrested in Bangkok and charged with lese majeste. She was detained by police as she was observing the arrest of an artist who spray-painted a message on the wall of Bangkok’s Grand Palace.  She was charged with lese majeste for participating in a political rally last year calling for an abolishment of the law when she was 14 years old, and has since been detained at a juvenile detention center in Nakhon Pathom province, west of Bangkok.  The arrest and prolonged detention of the girl drew widespread criticism from human rights groups both domestic and international. Human Rights Watch last month called for authorities to immediately drop charges and release her.  “By arresting a 15-year-old girl, the Thai government is sending the spine-chilling message that even children aren’t safe from being harshly punished for expressing their opinions,” Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said.  The Central Juvenile and Family Court in Bangkok released a statement last week saying her arrest and detention was lawful.  The girl remains locked up despite concerns that she would be forced to drop out from her school, which started a new semester on Tuesday.  ——-  Associated Press writer Grant Peck contributed to this report."

In the 75 minutes given to the twice impeached president, now the target of multiple criminal investigations, Trump encouraged Republicans to default on the nation’s debt, celebrated the failed Jan. 6 coup attempt he incited as a “beautiful day,” promised to pardon Jan. 6 rioters and yet again defamed E. Jean Carroll just one day after a jury awarded her $5 million for Trump’s sexual abuse and defamation. All this took place before a New Hampshire audience hand-picked by CNN that enthusiastically applauded and cheered every Trump lie and slur.  As Trump and several other long-shot Republican candidates vie for their party’s presidential nomination, GOP-controlled states are proposing and passing public policy measures that either target specific groups of Americans for repression and stigmatization or attack the very foundations of democracy and personal liberty. The authoritarian and fascist underpinnings of these initiatives are seen in laws that suppress the vote of people of color, gerrymander voting maps, criminalize abortion, ban books, censor public school teaching of America’s history of slavery and institutional racism, stigmatize LGBTQ and trans youth, impose fines on journalists with whom politicians disagree, repeal child labor laws, remove elected office holders who refuse to carry out oppressive policies, overturn election results and majority-supported referendums and much more.  Between The Lines’ Scott Harris spoke with Jason Stanley, Jacob Urowsky professor of philosophy at Yale University and author of “How Fascism Works: The Politics of Us and Them.” Here, Stanley examines the Republican party’s war against democratic accountability and governance as they work to impose minority rule.  JASON STANLEY: Isn’t it wild how there are so many different things happening at the same time? To understand that you need to step back and look. How are these different things related? These different things are related because they’re all attacks on freedom. Freedom to choose, for a woman. Freedom to have a same-sex relationship be normal. Freedom to vote.  They’re all attacks on kinds of freedom and the structure of the attacks, the ideology that links these together that goes after that, elevates the white Christian nationalism at the heart of our Jim Crow past. That elevates the white Christian nationalism in education and voting. In all of these areas, the concept one needs here is fascism. The U.S. fascism took this racial fascist form, anti-immigration, the panics over immigration, the structure of Great Replacement Theory that immigrants are coming to replace real Americans and vote instead of us.  Trump, in his speech, went back to the old themes targeting black majority are cities with large black populations as the sources of voter fraud. That’s the supposed justification between these absolutely absurd voter suppression moves. Florida just outdoes itself each month, it seems, with these voter suppression tactics of electoral police to tackle a non-existent problem of voter fraud.  So it’s an attack of democracy, an attack on education, an attack on LGBT, and they’re all happening together. It’s the same people. And they’re not stopping at high school education. They’re going after universities. They’re going after academic freedom. At each stage, the minimizers say, “Oh, they’re just targeting, you know, elementary schools.” So then they target high schools for education about LGBT issues. Then people say they’re not targeting universities and then they move to universities that make it illegal to talk about critical race theory or LGBT issues.  So they eliminate tenure (for professors). They target academic freedom. We’ve seen this before. It’s the rollback of democracy, authoritarianism, attacking education, attacking democracy. Fascism explains the violent militias. It also harkens back to U.S. history. Of course, the Confederacy, i.e. the Jim Crow era in particular, where some of these structures were laid down. So there’s a kind of familiarity about this, but we’ve let authoritarianism happen in state after state.  Look at Wisconsin. The governor voted in was a Democrat and the legislature met in a night session to remove all the powers from the governor. We’ve let all this happen. We’ve what we’ve let states that are 50-50 divided becomes dominated by Republican supermajority and legislatures. None of that is democratic. It’s like having a bunch of Hungary’s in the middle of the United States and then they venerate Hungary’s autocratic neo-fascist leader as the model.  So that’s the situation we face.  SCOTT HARRIS: You know, I did want to ask you to comment on one feature of this crisis we’re facing. The recent CNN town hall meeting with Donald Trump was really, in the view of many people, a 90-minute platform for this twice impeached president who incited a violent insurrection at the Capitol January 6, you know, was just convicted of sexual assault and defamation to spew his long list of lies and insults, further arousing hatred and fear in his base.  Has CNN and other media outlets normalized Trump and the GOP’s fascist agenda after all we’ve been through? And I would ask you to comment further on how you think our mainstream media can more responsibly cover Trump as he runs for president next year.  JASON STANLEY: The first question you asked was rhetorical. I mean, of course it was a normalization and of course it was repeating all the worst mistakes of 2016 and then some. So where they breathlessly covered every move of Trump like it was giving him billions in free media, like covering his rallies: “What will he do now?”  So as far as Trump’s speech, he brilliantly echoed these fascist themes. The Jan. 6 becomes a great patriotic moment, a heroic moment like the Beer Hall Putsch, Germany (coup attempt) in 1923. Ashli Babbitt becomes a Horst Wessel, the (German) storm trooper who was killed, supposedly by communists, who became this hero of Nazi propaganda that they sang about in the “Horst-Wessel-Lied.”  And Ashli Babbitt was shot by a black police officer. So if you look at what Trump said, he said, “The thug who killed Ashli Babbitt.” So it’s a clear reference to race. He’s setting up Ashli Babbitt as a pure martyr for his cause. It’s you know, it’s almost like he wrote a history book. But the main number one indicator of damage or severe democratic backsliding or loss of democracy is a coup that goes on punished.

Thurgate is Western’s first major signing on a three-year contract after they failed to reach the 2022-23 Finals Series.  Western’s unsuccessful title defence has prompted a shake-up of the playing squad, with Leo Lacroix, Jamie Young, Neil Kilkenny, Tongo Doumbia and James Troisi among the departures, while foundation player Dylan Pierias has also farewelled the 2021-22 champions.  Now, Thurgate arrives after six seasons at Newcastle Jets and kick-starts a new era for John Aloisi’s side.  ISUZU UTE A-LEAGUE: 2023-24 Ins & outs  “I’m buzzing to start a new challenge with Western United, I’m really looking forward to creating some history for this club and getting to work,” the 23-year-old said.  “Speaking with John (Aloisi) and Mal (Impiombato) and listening to the vision and plans for the  coming seasons really enticed me to want to join and add some more success to this club.  “I’m really excited to get down to Melbourne and get to work with the lads.”  READ MORE ON KEEPUP  ISUZU UTE A-LEAGUE SEMI FINAL SECOND LEGS: Everything you need to know  PODCAST VIEW: Adelaide urged to make ‘blockbuster’ Irankunda call to answer ‘massive, massive question’  TILIO GOES VIRAL: ‘Jesus… I’ve never seen that!’ Secret to incredible finals moment  THE MAKING OF MARINERS BOSS: The Zoo, ‘people stealing cars’ & Premier League ‘ambition’  TALBOT: An Olyroo’s ‘unreal’ transfer took 3 attempts: This is why he ‘couldn’t really say no’  Thurgate debuted for the Jets as a 17-year-old in 2018, and has since gone on to amass 116 Isuzu UTE A-League appearances, scoring 11 goals.  In 2019, then-Jets boss Ernie Merrick said: “He gets embarrassed because he’s from Port Macquarie and they call him the ‘Port Macquarie Pele’ which is a slight exaggeration.”  An Olyroo in 2021 and last year’s Isuzu UTE A-League Young Player of the Year, he scored two goals in 26 matches as the Jets finished six points short of the top six, while Western were three points outside the finals positions.  “We are extremely pleased to be able to bring a player of Angus’ calibre to our squad and to our club,” Aloisi said.  “Angus has been a regular first-team player from a young age and he will add significant quality into our midfield with his physicality, intelligence and his ability on the ball.  “As well as his talent, Angus has a fantastic character and will fit seamlessly into the culture of our club. I’m looking forward to seeing him join up with the squad as we strive to meet our goals next season.”  How did Newcastle react to losing Thurgate?  When Thurgate’s departure was confirmed on May 6, Newcastle Jets executive chairman Shane Mattiske expressed his disappointment, claiming an offer was tabled to the central midfielder which would have seen him become “one of the club’s highest earners.”  “Having worked hard to ensure he stays at this club,” Mattiske said.  “We felt that we made a very strong offer to Angus to stay here at the Jets. Our offer would have seen him become one of the club’s highest earners, however, we understand that his focus is on international opportunities, and if these don’t come in the short term, the ability to experience living in one of Australia’s big cities.  “Ultimately, we have to respect his decision.”"

On her part, De Lima, among the bravest opposition leaders in recent memory, exclaimed: “This is the beginning of my vindication. Answered prayers.”  As I have argued in the past, one should have expected a “whiff of change” under President Rodrigo Duterte’s successor. After all, the former commander in chief was so demagogically callous and amateur scattershot that some kind of “reboot” was inevitable, even under a supposed political ally.  Others would even go so far as arguing that since Ferdinand Marcos Sr. effectively broke the country—impoverishing a once-promising nation with unsustainable crony debt and one-of-a-kind decadent dictatorship—then maybe hope that Marcos Jr. will fix it. After all, not much changed for the vast majority of Filipinos in the four decades that separated his father’s tenure from his own.  De Lima’s acquittal can’t be separated from broader shifts in the political landscape, especially as the incumbent seeks better relations with traditional allies, which have been lobbying for a more modern and humane form of democratic governance in the country.  Dear reader: Anyone with a basic familiarity with facts on the ground, however, knows that “rule of law” is still an aspiration rather than a full-fledged reality in the country. Only sustained political struggle and effective mobilization by progressive forces can bring about genuine democracy.  And this brings us to the two most consequential elections of the year, which have demonstrated the power of progressive politics in even more illiberal-authoritarian contexts than in the Philippines. In neighboring Thailand, nothing less than an electoral revolt took place. Over the weekend, countless young voters propelled a progressive party to the center of Thai politics, thus effectively ending the binary struggle between the so-called “red shirt” faction, namely supporters of populist ex-prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, and the “yellow shirt” faction, namely supporters of the monarchy and urban middle class.  Barely years after resurrecting from the ashes of its predecessor, Future Forward Party, which was founded by young tycoon Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, and the Move Forward (MF) Party led by young technocrat Pita Limjaroenrat, defied all odds by topping all other major parties, including Thaksin’s, in this year’s elections.  Not long ago, the youthful and youth-driven party, broadly social democratic in ideological orientation, was seen as a tad too radical for the general Thai electorate. After all, this was a party that not only questioned mandatory military conscription and lèse-majesté, effectively challenging the two pillars of conservative power in Thailand, but also advocated for a massive increase in minimum wages as well as the legalization of same-sex marriage.  Over the weekend, Pita insisted that there would be no compromise on his party’s key policy agenda, though it remains unclear how he could assume power without forming a coalition with not only Thaksin’s Pheu Thai Party but also, at least, one faction of the pro-military establishment, most notably that of Deputy Prime Minister Gen. Prawit Wongsuwan. Nevertheless, MF’s electoral success under the shadow of a pro-military establishment, not to mention the threat of yet another coup, underscores the importance of authentically progressive and tirelessly charismatic leadership.  Meanwhile, Turkey has experienced its tightest elections in recent memory, with the strongman populist incumbent going neck and neck with the opposition. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is arguably one of the most successful politicians of the 21st century. Politically savvy, he is also a classic survivor, having overcome, in a span of a decade, a judicial coup (by secular rivals) as well as a military coup (by traditionalist allies) on the way to consolidating his grip on the country.  But by leveraging a unified opposition, and drawing on his well-established credentials as a capable and compassionate technocrat, Kemal Kilicdaroglu has come closer than anyone to defeating Erdogan in general elections. In both Thailand and Turkey, the progressive opposition has managed to pull off massive electoral gains and mobilize broad-based support groups even under the most intimidating conditions, which dwarf structural challenges in the Philippines. In both countries, charismatic, capable, and uncompromising leaders unified disparate civil society groups and fearlessly advocated for progressive reform against the tide of authoritarian populism."

In addition to casting Halle Bailey as a black Ariel, the new live-action remake of Disney’s 1989 animated classic will find the mermaid heroine having a “more grown-up and mature” relationship with Prince Eric, according to his portrayer Jonah Hauer-King.  That includes an update of Alan Menken’s “Kiss the Girl” lyrics so that it wouldn’t seem as if Eric was forcing himself on Ariel.  “My understanding is that there were some feelings around consent and asking to kiss someone, which makes total sense to me,” Hauer-King, 27, told the Hollywood Reporter.  Having witnessed the racist backlash that Bailey faced for playing Ariel, the London native said he does “not really understand what to make of it.”  “Rob [Marshall, the director] and the producers and Disney didn’t approach this film and this casting with any kind of agenda — they just wanted to cast the person who was best for the role,” said Hauer-King.

By FRONTIER  With temperatures soaring past 40 degrees Celsius for much of April, nationwide power shortages were keenly felt across Myanmar as the military regime tightly rationed electricity. The junta’s inability to keep the lights on has caused hardship for business owners, some of whom need constant electricity.  “When I operate my press, it needs to run continuously for eight hours,” said the owner of a printing press in Yangon’s downtown Pazundaung Township, who now relies on an expensive generator to avoid disruptions.  A rice mill owner in Ayeyarwady Region’s Maubin Township, meanwhile, told Frontier he had to shut down his business entirely.  As usual, the military regime has sought to blame those opposed to its rule, saying resistance forces conducted 229 attacks on electricity infrastructure since the 2021 coup. On April 6 state media accused “terrorists” of “intentionally attacking against the infrastructures related to the electric power generation, transmission and distribution to the public”.  But the National Unity Government, appointed by elected lawmakers deposed in the coup, and resistance forces say they are cutting off a vital source of military power while taking measures to avoid overly inconveniencing the general public.  “The military council needs electricity to run its war machine, like the production of weapons and ammunition. So, it’s important for us to cut the power supply,” U Naing Htoo Aung, permanent secretary of the NUG’s defence ministry, told Frontier.  The coup and subsequent violent crackdown on peaceful protests sparked a grassroots uprising against military rule, with armed resistance groups known as People’s Defence Forces emerging across the country.  While not lacking in courage or manpower, the PDFs are severely outgunned. The military receives sophisticated weapons from Russia and China, including aircraft, but resistance forces rely on the extortionate black market and homemade guns. Some have therefore turned their attention to levelling the playing field – by sabotaging the military’s weapons factories.  “We will attack and destroy anything that supports the military council’s production of arms and ammunition and its propaganda networks,” said Ko Wai Yan, spokesperson for the Bago Region PDF, which is under the NUG’s chain of command.  “We have instructed our forces to minimise as much as possible the effect on the people,” added Naing Htoo Aung.  But because of how Myanmar’s electricity grid operates, with virtually all nodes connected in a single network, taking any of them offline can temporarily disrupt the overall flow of electricity, which can result in knock-on power cuts in residential areas. This, however, is true both for targeted resistance assaults on infrastructure and more indiscriminate military attacks like village burnings and airstrikes.  Who’s to blame?  All of the civilians interviewed for this article blamed the power outages on the junta, but most also appealed to resistance forces to take measures to avoid making ordinary people’s lives more difficult.  “Under the National League for Democracy, there were times in the [March to May] hot season when power was only available part-time,” said a woman who lives in Yangon’s North Okkalapa Township, referring to the overthrown elected government.  She said under the junta, power is rationed even more severely, and frequently isn’t available even during scheduled times.  “The military council blames the power failures on this or that and it can say what it likes, but this situation is due to its mismanagement,” she said.  However, she said PDFs should take care to minimise the impact of sabotage attacks on the public.  “I only want attacks that will affect the military council. I can understand why the PDFs need to carry out such attacks, but as transmission lines deliver power from one place to another, we don’t want attacks that will harm the people,” she said.  But Mr Guillaume de Langre, a former advisor to the civilian government on energy policy, said while resistance attacks “occasionally disrupt the stability of the grid, most power cuts are the result of bad policy, economic chaos and loss of investor confidence in the junta”.  According to de Langre’s data, in this year’s second quarter, Myanmar is producing 2,444 megawatts less electricity than was projected before the coup. Most of the lost power – 1,418 MW – is because planned projects have been cancelled or left in limbo, while another 800 MW has been lost from power plants shutting down since the coup.  Chart showing the causes of the power shortage in Myanmar based on pre-coup projections of energy available in this year’s second quarter. (Guillaume de Langre)  A Yangon Electricity Supply Corporation official told the pro-military Popular News Journal in April that 1,500 MW was being distributed nationally, down from 3,200 MW before the coup. Repeated attempts by Frontier to seek comment from YESC chief executive officer U Kyaw Thu were unsuccessful.  “Investors lost trust in Myanmar, so dozens of power plants were either shut down or cancelled,” de Langre explained.  For example, 26 proposed solar power plants were reportedly cancelled last year after Chinese companies postponed signing power purchase agreements that were agreed on before the coup.  Another 226 MW, or around 9 percent of the lost energy, is a result of resistance attacks on power lines, de Langre’s data shows. In February, the Karenni Nationalities Defence Force said it blew up nine electricity towers in southern Shan State’s Pekon Township supplying power to the capital Nay Pyi Taw.  A spokesperson for the armed group, which was founded after the coup and primarily operates in Kayah and southern Shan states, said the KNDF only targeted transmission lines “that are to be used against us”.  But while Nay Pyi Taw may be the power centre of the regime, there are hundreds and thousands of ordinary civilians living there too. And besides increased hardship for affected communities, there has also been some cost in human lives.  In December, the junta claimed 19 electricity workers had been killed in resistance attacks on infrastructure since 2021, with another 56 injured.  Naing Htoo Aung said the NUG’s policy is to “act in accordance with international conventions”, but while they are considered civilians under international law, civil servants and local officials working for the regime have been targeted by resistance forces on an almost daily basis.  “What we want is for people better than Min Aung Hlaing to rule us. It’s true we support the NUG, but we don’t support anything that would hurt people,” said a woman from Nay Pyi Taw’s Zabuthiri Township, who criticised resistance attacks that have killed or injured civilians.  Nay Pyi Taw PDF spokesperson Bo Ngwe Soe admitted to setting off “warning bombs” to deter electricity workers from collecting unpaid bills from those participating in a boycott, but did not say whether his group had killed or injured any of the workers.  An electricity worker in Magway Region’s Chauk Township, an area with strong resistance activity, said he lives in fear.  “We’re worried we could be attacked at work or even while we’re off duty, because these things are happening and we don’t have any weapons,” he said.  He said a PDF once planted explosives near power lines in Chauk, and one of his friends and colleagues was briefly abducted last year in Shan State.  “I don’t know why they arrested him, but after 10 days in custody he was released,” he said.  Looking ahead  Contrary to de Langre’s data, the junta claimed in the state-run Myanma Alinn in December last year that sabotage attacks on the national power grid had reduced supply by about 160MW.  “It always lies, and it will continue to lie, and the people know that,” the NUG’s Naing Htoo Aung said.  A woman in Yangon’s Hlaing Township said the electricity shortages are evidence of Senior General Min Aung Hlaing’s shortcomings and called for the dictator to step down.  “I support what the PDF is doing, including the sabotage attacks on transmission towers. I want the revolution to succeed as quickly as possible,” she said.  The printing press owner agreed.  “They are ruling the country, so it’s their responsibility,” he said.  The December article in Myanma Alinn also said it had not been possible to carry out necessary repair work in some areas.  “Attacks on infrastructure are low risk/high impact, and they can happen anywhere,” said de Langre. “For the junta, it’s very expensive to keep repairing the lines. High voltage lines cost tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars to fix.”  Political analyst U Than Soe Naing said the junta’s priorities were clear from its budget allocations. For the 2023-24 fiscal year, the regime allocated more than K5.6 trillion to defence spending, up nearly K2 trillion compared to the previous year. By contrast, it granted only K680 billion to the electricity sector, which is heavily subsidised, and has experienced a collapse and only partial recovery in bill collection since the coup.  “We can assume that the military council will escalate military operations and will not solve the problems of the people in education, health and electricity supply. The reason for the chaos in electricity supply is the mismanagement of the military council,” he said.  De Langre said he expects these attacks to continue, and to become “more frequent and sophisticated”.  The woman from North Okkalapa said she would continue supporting the PDFs and called for others to do the same.  “They need to take great care not to hurt the people, but sometimes inconveniences might happen unexpectedly,” she said. “People should understand that PDFs are fighting for the people. So, I for one would support any attack they deem necessary.”"

The Karen National Union’s leadership is seen at the 75th anniversary of the group’s founding held at KNU headquarters in eastern Myanmar's Kayin state on the Thai-Myanmar border, Feb. 5, 2022.  The Karen National Union, Myanmar’s oldest ethnic armed group that has allied itself with the anti-junta People's Defense Forces and the shadow government made up of junta opponents, has rejected peace talks offered by Myanmar’s military regime that rules the country.  The junta made the proposal on May 9 after a leadership reshuffle during the 17th Congress of the Karen group, which has been engaged in an armed struggle for a federal democracy against the Myanmar military for more than 70 years.  The KNU held the conference online on April 24-May 4 at its headquarters on the Thai-Myanmar border in mountainous Kayin state. The group and its armed wing, the Karen National Liberation Army, operates mostly in Kayin and Mon states and the Bago and Tanintharyi regions.  KNU leaders decided that the organization and its armed wing, the Karen National Liberation Army, would join forces with other armed groups that have revolted against the junta and work towards the establishment of a federal democratic system in the country.  During the conference, the KNU named several newly elected officials to the organization’s leadership, including Padoh Saw Kwe Htoo Win, who served as vice president in the last term, as its new chair.  He was deeply involved in former peace talks between the KNU and successive Myanmar regimes, but after the February 2021 coup that brought the military to power, he was closely associated with and supported the armed resistance, according to KNU sources.  As the first ethnic armed group to publicly denounce the coup, the KNU paid dearly for its action, suffering heavy airstrikes and ground offensives after the KNLA captured a Myanmar military base and a later escalation of fighting when junta troops bombarded a site for internally displaced persons.  The KNLA also increased attacks on junta troops, sheltered protesters and trained local anti-coup forces.  Six members of the central executive committee were not re-elected, including KNU President General Saw Mutu Say Poe, who opposed armed resistance against the coup and called for a dialogue.  Rejects cease-fire  The KNU said it would fight against the military dictatorship and cooperate with other ethnic armed organizations, democratic forces and people who have been struggling for the establishment of a federal democratic union and for democracy, equality and autonomy.  KNU Central Committee member Padoh Saw Thamein Tun told RFA that it was impossible to talk with the Military Administration Council, the formal name of the junta regime, in accordance with the nationwide cease-fire agreement, or NCA.  The KNU was one of eight armed ethnic groups that signed the NCA with the national military in 2015, but its legitimacy wavered because of Myanmar military incursions into KNU-controlled areas.  “Now we can’t work under the NCA,” he told Radio Free Asia.  “What is happening now is that [ethnic-majority Bamar] chauvinism and military dictatorship prevail,” he said. “We will fight these and then establish a federal democracy.”  Trainees take part in military exercises with Karen National Union Brigade 6 in eastern Myanmar’s Kayin state, May 9, 2021. Credit: AFP  After the congress, the junta’s National Solidarity and Peacemaking Negotiation Committee issued a statement criticizing the KNU’s decision, saying it went against the terms of the NCA and would lead to confrontation. The committee also said holding talks would be the best way to work towards a solution for long-term peace.  KNU spokesman Padoh Saw Kler Say told local media outlets that the union did not accept the military council’s peace offer. RFA could not reach him by phone for comment.  The shadow National Unity Government said it hoped to cooperate with the new KNU leaders to speed up armed resistance to the junta this year, according to Kyaw Zaw, spokesman for the president’s office.  “We hope to work together with all the ethnic armed groups, including the KNU, to attack the common enemy, the military dictatorship, right away, and accelerate cooperation between us to topple the military dictatorship,” he said.  More fierce fighting likely  Political and military analysts said the KNU’s rejection of talks could intensify military offensives in areas it controls.  Thein Tun Oo, executive director of the Thayninga Strategic Studies Institute, a group of former Burmese military officers, believes that war will come about because the new KNU leaders are hardliners who have supported armed resistance against the national military.  “They prioritize the armed struggle rather than holding a dialogue,” he said. “If the other side chooses the hard way, the military side will respond the same way.”  Political analyst Ye Tun agreed that new KNU leaders are more inclined to fight than previous ones.  “Now, we have to say that the path of armed struggle has gained the upper hand,” he said.

TOKYO (AP) — Leaders of seven of the world’s most powerful democracies will gather this weekend for the Group of Seven summit in Hiroshima, the location of the world’s first atomic attack at the end of World War II. From the emergence of crucial developing countries to security worries, including growing aggression from China, North Korea and Russia, here’s a look at the G-7, who will attend and some of the key issues: ___ WHAT IS THE G-7 SUMMIT? The Group of Seven is an informal group of leading industrialized nations. It consists of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.  G-7 leaders likely to focus on the war in Ukraine and tensions in Asia at summit in Hiroshima  HIROSHIMA, Japan (AP) — The symbolism will be palpable when leaders of the world’s rich democracies sit down in Hiroshima, a city whose name evokes the tragedy of war, to tackle a host of challenges including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and rising tensions in Asia. The attention on the war in Europe comes just days after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy completed a whirlwind trip to meet many of the Group of Seven leaders now heading to Japan for the summit starting Friday. That tour was aimed at adding to his country’s weapons stockpile and building political support ahead of a widely anticipated counteroffensive to reclaim lands occupied by Moscow’s forces.  UN expert: Myanmar military imported $1 billion in weapons since 2021 coup  UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Myanmar’s military has imported at least $1 billion worth of weapons and related material from Russia, China and other countries since its February 2021 coup, some of which it has used to carry out atrocities against civilians, according to a U.N. report released Wednesday. The weapons continue to flow to the military despite overwhelming evidence of its responsibility for the atrocities, including some that amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, said Tom Andrews, the U.N. independent investigator on human rights in Myanmar. As an example of what he called the junta’s brutality, Andrews pointed to its April 11 airstrike using a Russian Yak-130 fighter jet on a ceremony attended by some 300 opponents of army rule, which was quickly followed by an attack by Russian Mi-35 helicopters on those who came to help.  Biden says there’s ‘work to do’ on global stage as he heads to Japan; US debt limit standoff looms  WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden said there’s “work to do” on the global stage as he headed to Japan on Wednesday to consult with allies on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and China’s assertiveness in the Pacific at the same time that a debt limit standoff looms at home. With high-stakes talks to head off a federal default underway in Washington, Biden pledged to remain in “constant contact” with negotiators in the capital city while he conducts international diplomacy. The president departed Washington aboard Air Force One a day after scrapping plans for a historic stop in Papua New Guinea and a key visit to Australia amid the showdown with House Republicans over raising the federal debt limit.  Ukraine’s foreign minister and visiting Chinese envoy discuss peace, but next steps unclear  KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine’s foreign minister met with a visiting Chinese mediator to discuss how to end Russia’s war, but no details were disclosed Wednesday and the next steps were unclear. Over two days, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba discussed with envoy Li Hui “ways to stop Russian aggression,” the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Kuleba briefed Li, a former Chinese ambassador to Moscow, “about the principles of restoring a stable and just peace based on respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.” Kuleba, according to the statement, repeated his government’s position that Ukraine wouldn’t accept any proposal involving the loss of its territories or the “freezing of the conflict.” There was no word on how Li responded to Kuleba.  Chinese envoy asks Australia to increase search for 39 aboard capsized fishing boat in Indian Ocean  CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — A Chinese envoy asked Australian authorities Thursday to increase efforts to find survivors in an Indian Ocean search for 39 missing from a capsized Chinese fishing boat. Ambassador to Australia Xiao Qian said the Australian authority had already sent four airplanes and three ships to the search area, which is in the center of the Indian Ocean. No survivors or life rafts have been spotted. Xiao said China wanted to coordinate with “friendly countries,” including Australia, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and the Maldives, on the search and rescue effort following the capsizing Tuesday. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority, the search coordinator, said the upturned hull was spotted Tuesday from a cargo ship 5,000 kilometers (3,100 miles) northwest of the Australian west coast city of Perth.  China asks embassies to avoid ‘propaganda’ in apparent reference to pro-Ukrainian displays  BEIJING (AP) — Foreign embassies in Beijing have been asked by the Chinese government to avoid displaying “propaganda” in an apparent response to shows of support for Ukraine. Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s government says it is neutral in Moscow’s 15-month-old invasion of Ukraine but has repeated Russian justifications for the attack, accusing the U.S. and NATO of provoking Moscow. Beijing was due to send an envoy this week to Ukraine and Russia to discuss a possible “political settlement,” but the effort is thought unlikely to make progress given China’s rhetorical, diplomatic and economic support for Moscow. A spokesperson for the European Union said the Protocol Department of the Chinese Foreign Ministry circulated a note on May 8 to all diplomatic missions to the effect that they should “respect Chinese laws and regulations” and “not to use the external walls of embassies to carry out politicized propaganda to avoid causing disputes between countries.” The note does not specify what might constitute “politicized propaganda”, nor communicates further on the matter, said the spokesperson, Nabila Massrali, adding that the EU Delegation in Beijing “has not changed any items displayed at its front wall.” Another European diplomat who asked not to be identified further due to the sensitivity of the issue, confirmed Massrali’s account, saying embassies had been asked by the Foreign Ministry not to use their outer walls for “political propaganda.” He also said his government doesn’t “see any reason to change” its display.  New Zealand budget plan offers modest financial relief ahead of election  WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Months before an election, New Zealand’s government on Thursday offered some modest financial relief to many people by making most prescription medicines free and increasing subsidies for child care and public transportation. But the government’s annual budget plan was notable for its lack of big new initiatives. Since taking office earlier this year, Prime Minister Chris Hipkins has promised a back-to-basics approach and axed many of the more ambitious — and contentious — plans of his predecessor, Jacinda Ardern. Finance Minister Grant Robertson said the budget was all about doing the basics well. “It’s pragmatic and it’s practical and it’s the right budget for these times,” Robertson said.  Thailand’s Move Forward Party in talks with 5 other parties in attempt to form coalition government  BANGKOK (AP) — Thailand’s progressive Move Forward Party on Wednesday held its first face-to-face discussions with five other parties in an attempt to form a coalition government, three days after scoring a stunning national election victory. A new government will be formed in July when the House of Representatives and the appointed Senate select a new prime minister. Because of the joint vote, Sunday’s election victor is not assured of taking power. Representatives of the five parties, mostly members of the opposition to Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha’s conservative government, met for several hours Wednesday.

Japan’s leader welcomes investment, exchanges to strengthen computer chip supply chain  TOKYO (AP) — Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida stressed that investment and international exchanges to strengthen the computer chip supply chain were welcome, as he met with the leaders of top computer chips makers Thursday. A recent shortage of chips was a sore point for Japan’s manufacturing powerhouses like Toyota Motor Corp., when social restrictions related to the coronavirus pandemic crimped supplies, serving as a wake-up call that solid access to production must be ensured. Computer chips are used in vehicles, mobile phones and an array of other products, and next-generation chips are going to be crucial for artificial intelligence, automated driving systems and other advanced technology."

Fiji Indians, who were a majority, did not insist on the “one man, one vote” principle. It was understood that the Fijians will be in power with the support of “others” and the Indians will take care of the economy based on cane cultivation and tourism.  Ratu Mara, the hereditary Chief of Fiji, became the Prime Minister and remained so for 17 years. This happy situation turned sour when some educated Fijians joined with the Indians to form a Labour Party and came to power in the elections in 1987. The Fijian chiefs revolted against the Labour government and instigated a bloodless military coup by Sitiveni Rabuka, the third-ranking military officer in the Fiji army. Colonel Rabuka overthrew the elected government and installed a regime mostly of Fijians and brought in a constitution which virtually disenfranchised the Indian Fijians. Rabuka happened to be an alumnus of India’s Defence Services Staff College in Wellington, Tamil Nadu.  Former Fiji Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka with TP Sreenivasan. Photo: Special arrangement  After three more coups and changes of government, Sitiveni Rabuka, the coup leader won the recent election and became Prime Minister with the support of the Fiji Indians.  Reconciliation efforts  Moreover, in a surprise move, Prime Minister Rabuka made a public apology in May 2023 for his role in the 1987 coup which overthrew the elected government of Prime Minister Timoci Bavadra. In his apology, Rabuka expressed his regret for the actions taken in the coup, stating, ""I make this confession on my own behalf and on behalf of all those who took part with me in the military coup on the 14th of May, 1987. We confess our wrongdoings, and we confess that we have hurt so many of our people in Fiji, particularly those of the Indo-Fijian community.”  ""Rabuka admitted in a tweet that ""you have every right to blame us for the difficulties you went through, we do not blame you for being angry with us or even hate us, you are justified in your anger and your hate. I stand here to confess and to ask for your forgiveness.""  Rabuka's apology came at a time when India is seeking to deepen its engagement with the Pacific Islands. The third Forum for India-Pacific Islands Cooperation (FIPIC) summit is being held in May in Papua New Guinea, which will be attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He is expected to announce several initiatives for cooperation with the island states.  The apology by Rabuka is also seen as a significant step towards reconciliation between the indigenous Fijian and Indian communities, and it is hoped that it will help to heal the wounds caused by the coup. It also sends a positive message to India and other countries in the region that Fiji is committed to democracy and good governance.  Some of the island nations of the South Pacific, which had traditionally maintained a pro-western policy under the influence of Australia and New Zealand have entered into strategic relations with China. The West is increasingly depending on Fiji to counter China and Prime Minister Rabuka may have found links with India extremely important at this time.  Rabuka over the years  Rabuka has been quite mercurial in the last 36 years. During his days in the Staff College, he was very popular as a soldier and a socialite. An admiral’s wife, who met him in Wellington, felt that the Fiji Indians might have been responsible for turning the “Steve” she knew into a dictator. He played golf with me and he was prim and proper in every way. A day before the coup he told me that he would be busy for the next few days and would not be able to play. He was ruthless in handling the coup and claimed that he and his soldiers who entered the parliament were fully armed, but he made sure that there was no bloodshed. He claimed throughout that he was acting on his own, but when I met him in 2014 in Suva, when neither of us had any official position, he said that both he and I had acted under instructions and, therefore, we should have no animosity with each other. He is the only coup leader in history who played himself in a movie on the coup.  With the unconditional apology Rabuka has made, Fiji has come full circle and it appears that Fiji is once again the world as it should be. But Rabuka should remain firm in his commitment to racial amity and good relations to regain the lost paradise.

He had died of a cardiac arrest.  News traveled quickly across the world: one of the faces of Argentina’s cruelest dictatorship, dead in the cell of a common prison.  The human rights organizations and survivors of the dictatorship era fought long and hard for the dictators to be tried and sentenced to jail. They asked for them to go through a process their victims never had: being properly investigated and judged.  To this day many questions and gaps about Videla’s role during those dark years of Argentine history remain unsolved. As he died, he took with him the truth about many of his victims’ fates.  The first five years of horror  On March 24, 1976, Videla sat before six microphones and a camera to read a 45-minute statement announcing the military coup against Isabel Perón’s government and the start of what he called a “national reorganization process”.  “Our country is undergoing one of the hardest phases in its history, the intervention of the armed forces is the only alternative,” he said  He was proclaimed president by the military junta that led the coup, and stayed in charge for five years.  Originally from Mercedes, a town in Buenos Aires province, Jorge Rafael Videla was a military man who built a long career between 1944 and 1975. He held various roles during the Argentine Revolution, a dictatorship that lasted from 1966 to 1973, and was, by 1976, the head of the armed forces. His designation in 1975 was announced by Antonio Cafiero, a member of Perón’s government at the time. He described Videla as “an apolitical, absolutely professional man, who could never carry out a coup.”  Although Videla was considered part of the “soft” wing of the junta, reportedly pushing for a quick transition back to democracy, those five years were the cruelest of the military dictatorship. They were tainted by an orchestrated and silent annihilation system against those labeled “subversive”: of the 30,000 kidnapped, tortured, murdered and disappeared, most were abducted during the Videla years.  Over 500 babies born in captivity were stolen by the military, some of whom have not recovered their true histories and identities to this day. A network of clandestine detention centers was set up across the country. There was a climate of terror that kept many from speaking out, while thousands fled the country in order to avoid being kidnapped.  It was also in 1976 that the Operation Condor, a scheme hatched by the armies of eight South American countries to capture and kill leftist militants, had Argentina as its epicenter.  During his years as de facto president, and those that came after, Videla insisted that the disappeareances, tortures, murders, rapes and abductions carried out by the armed forces during those years were the result of defending the interests of the country.  In a Casa Rosada press conference in 1979, Videla made one of his most notorious public statements when asked about claims of human rights violations in Argentina.  “We Argentines should not be ashamed, because what happened was a defense of human rights, threatened by terrorism,” he said. “The disappeared are an incognita (…) as long as they remain disappeared, they can’t have special treatment, for they are disappeared; they’ve no entity, they’re neither dead nor alive, they’re disappeared: we can’t do anything about it.”  During a TV interview in 1980, he said that the so-called “war” had “left an amount of dead, prisoners and disappeared that was painful,” but that he felt proud that the armed forces had “won”, because “today, the country enjoys peace, freedom, respect.”  “It came at a high cost,” he said, “but the people agreed that we had to do it in order to achieve peace.”  The military junta referred to the crimes against humanity perpetrated during the dictatorship as the “dirty war”, implying that its atrocities were a necessary evil to win a war between foes of equal standing. Today, it is considered an offensive and denialist term by Argentina’s human rights movement because it portrays victims of state terrorism as combatants.  At that point, the Mothers and Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo, alongside other human rights organizations, were working incessantly to find information about the fate of their loved ones. Videla and his associates targeted them as “crazy”.  After the return of democracy in 1983, a growing number of victims summoned the strength to speak out about what had happened to them.  Videla was tried in the historic Trial of the Juntas (portrayed recently in the film Argentina, 1985 by Santiago Mitre), where he was sentenced to life in prison for 469 crimes against humanity.  He was later pardoned in 1990 by President Carlos Menem alongside other Junta members and guerrilla activists, in what the president considered an attempt to “reconcile” the military with those who had fought against it.  Videla went back to prison briefly in 1998 when a Federal Judge ordered his pre-trial detention for the crime of child appropriation. After 38 days, he was placed under house arrest until 2008, when Federal Judge Norberto Oyarbide ordered his detention due to the gravity of his crimes. He spent the last five years of his life in prison.  With time, Videla would be convicted twice more: to another life sentence in 2010 for the killing of 29 political prisoners in San Martín in 1976, and to 50 years in prison in 2012 for the systematic plan that led to the abduction of twenty children under the age of 10.  In a document called “The dimension of impunity”, the Public Prosecution Ministry organized information about Videla’s court cases, showing that he was accused in 24 cases that encompassed more than 1,200 victims. He died before being tried for many of his crimes, including those under Operation Condor.  Jorge Rafael Videla never revealed the fate of those who remain missing, nor what happened to the babies abducted in captivity, among other questions. The victims’ families are still searching for answers to this day.  The Herald’s archive  On September 5, 1977, Videla traveled to the United States to take part in the signing of the Panama Canal Agreement at the OAS. During his weeklong trip, he held meetings with U.S. President Jimmy Carter. Carter expressed concern over human rights violations in Argentina, but Videla stood by his administration’s actions.  Several other Latin American leaders traveled to Washington those days – including dictators Alfredo Stroessner in Paraguay and Augusto Pinochet in Chile.  The Herald reported at the time that “when the two touched on the sensitive human rights issue, Carter expressed his concern for the number of people who are jailed in Argentina, the need for them to be quickly brought to trial, and the need for Argentina to let the rest of the world know the situation of the prisoners.”  Simultaneously, the Herald published an editorial by Robert Cox that said that, as Videla was in the US making commitments to improve the transparency of the detentions, Alfredo Bravo, the founder of the Education Workers’ Confederation (CTERA), had been kidnapped. “This incident,” wrote Cox, “calls for just the kind of action that President Videla has been promising in Washington. Unless the words that have, apparently, won over President Carter are followed by action, the country’s unfortunate image will become even blacker in foreign eyes – and with justice.”  As with the Deutsch’s family case in Córdoba, Cox’s views and the Herald’s coverage would become, once again, bold and necessary. Bravo would spend 10 days captive, being tortured by Miguel Etchecolatz, one of the dictatorship’s most violent repressors. His testimony before the US embassy’s officials in 1978 would become the grounds for a memorandum in which the U.S. government’s Latin America advisor Robert Pastor would recommend working on “a new strategy with Argentina.”  President Carter’s comments did not, however, alter the course of Videla and the Junta’s actions. Videla would be replaced as dictator by Roberto Viola in 1981. After being tried and pardoned, he spent most of the nineties avoiding the public eye. He was seen occasionally going to church and in a small number of media appearances.  Every day for the last 47 years, the families of the victims of his coup, civil society and human rights advocates across the world have worked to register, testify and tell the stories of the years when Videla and the Junta suspended Argentine democracy and inaugurated some of the darkest years in the country´s history. Videla is remembered in Argentina today not as a monster, but as the result of what authoritarianism, violence, and hatred can provoke.  Thanks to the efforts of those who sought truth and justice from the very beginning, he is also remembered as a dictator that underwent due trial, was sentenced, and died in a common prison cell ten years ago today."

Dozens of academics and public figures have signed an open letter calling for the release of jailed Tunisian opposition leader Rached Ghannouchi, who was arrested late last month, pending a trial.  Ghannouchi, who was the speaker of parliament before it was suspended by Tunisia’s President Kais Saied in July 2021, was jailed on suspicion of plotting against state security.  According to his lawyer, the 81-year-old was sentenced in absentia this week to a year in prison.  The 150 signatories in Wednesday’s open letter said Ghannouchi was arrested for a public statement in which he “criticised Tunisian President Kais Saied’s coup against democracy”.  They said his arrest is part of a wide-ranging “politically motivated witch hunt”.  “Mr Ghannouchi is recognised as one of the most prominent advocates of democracy in the Arab world,” the signatories, from 18 countries across North America and Europe, wrote.  “His consensus-building approach and consistent calls for dialogue and unity across political, intellectual and ideological lines are needed in Tunisia, the wider region and beyond more than ever.”  Saied has been conducting a continuing crackdown against the country’s opposition since he suspended parliament. Several opposition figures have been detained in recent months, many of them from the prominent Ennahdha Party.      He gave himself powers to rule and legislate by decree and seized control of the judiciary in what rivals saw as a blow to democracy in the birthplace of the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings.  “Tunisian democrats have not remained silent. Dozens are in prison for bravely defending their hard won rights and freedoms, and faced trumped up charges of ‘conspiring against the state’,” the letter read.  The signatories further expressed their “support and solidarity for all political prisoners”.  “We call on the Tunisian authorities to release all political prisoners and to restore freedoms and human rights in Tunisia.”  In October 2011, Ennahdha emerged as the largest party in the country’s first parliamentary elections since the removal of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, winning 37 percent of the vote.  Over the last several weeks, authorities in Tunisia have arrested at least 17 other Ennahdha party members, prompting rights groups like Human Rights Watch to condemn the Tunisian government.  The US-based rights group has warned that the government was “moving to neutralize the country’s largest political party”.  HRW said last week the total number of arrests of opposition figures considered critical of Saied stood at 30.  Other critics have said Saied has moved the country, which also faces a grinding economic crisis, down a dangerous path back towards autocracy.  Saied maintains that Tunisia needs a strong presidency to enable the officeholder to act quickly and decisively.  Those targeted in the latest crackdown included political activists and lawyers."

The demonstration was not welcomed, however, by pro-civilian rule activists and political leaders, who regard the protesters as lending support and legitimacy to a military that has committed abuses, including the 2021 coup.  Residents of the city, meanwhile, urged all sides to calm the situation in Port Sudan, which has become an important haven for hundreds of thousands of people in the war-torn country, not to mention a commercial lifeline.  Led by the same people who have previously shut down Sudan’s chief port to place political pressure on opponents, there are fears that the rally could escalate at a time when stability and prosperity in Port Sudan are needed more than ever.

Stay informed with MEE's newsletters Sign up to get the latest alerts, insights and analysis, starting with Turkey Unpacked  The Beja, many of whom follow the prominent traditional leader, Mohamed al-Amin Tirik, described Perthes as representative of “new colonialism” and an enemy to the Sudanese people.  They demanded that he leave the country within 72 hours, accusing him of malignly intervening in domestic issues and politics.  Perthes was a key player in negotiations for the framework agreement to bring a transitional political system in place following the October 2021 military coup, which was led by the military and RSF and removed Sudan’s civilian government.

The framework agreement negotiated this year to resume a civilian and democratic path for Sudanese rule was then rejected by Beja leaders, who felt their community’s concerns were not met. Meanwhile, the agreement’s plans to fold the RSF into the army broke into violence on 15 April, which a month later has claimed over 800 lives.  The Beja crowd chanted for Tirik, as well as shouting ""Volker get out"" and ""Sudan is a free country"".  Tirik addressed the crowd from the Red Sea state municipality building, saying no one will leave unless the special envoy is expelled soon.  “We can rule our country without these interventions. This is our priority and political path, then we can sit as an army, national political parties and communities to solve our problems and see how we can support the transitional path and the civilian democratic ruling,” Tirik told the rally.  “We have submitted a memo to the head of the army including our demands and we will see. If they adopt it that’s OK, but if not we will be back here to stay,” he added, claiming the UN envoy’s continuing presence would only bring instability to eastern Sudan.  Calls for calm  Activists from the Resistance Committees pro-democracy network and leading members of the Forces for Freedom and Change political alliance (FFC) from the Red Sea state denounced the Beja rally as “propaganda”, and suggested they had ties to the government under former autocrat, Omar al-Bashir.  “This is a part of the army’s propaganda that we know very well. These groups were part of the old regime and they are basically supporting the army and they previously closed the port and made a lot of economic troubles and paved the way for the military to make the coup and hinder the transition,” one activist told MEE, speaking on condition of anonymity for security reasons.  “Instead of playing these politics and adopting the agenda of the old regime, it’s better for those leaders to at least stand against the violations that are being committed by the two warring parties,” another said.  'We want peace and we want Port Sudan to continue helping those who fled the war' - Isam Hassan, resident  For Port Sudan’s civilian residents, the priority is keeping the country’s conflict and divisive politics out of the city.  With Sudan’s already threadbare infrastructure shredded by the war, Port Sudan has become a lifeline for everything from aid to commerce to evacuations.  Most Sudanese ministries and international organisations are currently operating out of the city after Khartoum was engulfed in fighting.  “We are not with the RSF or SAF [Sudanese armed forces]. We want peace and we want Port Sudan to continue helping those who fled the war from different parts of the country, including Khartoum,” Isam Hassan, a 34-year-old resident, told MEE in Port Sudan’s market.  “We don’t like this polarisation reaching here. We thank god that the activities of the RSF and the war in the Red Sea state stopped after one or two days of the war,” Fatima Gad al-Moula, another resident, added."

The Pacific island nation saw its first change of leader in 16 years at a tightly fought national election in December, where Fiji First, which won 42% of the vote, was defeated by a coalition of three parties.  Four Fiji political parties were suspended for 30 days on Wednesday for not submitting audited accounts, local media reported.  In a statement, the parliamentary speaker's office said it had been notified by the Acting Registrar of Political Parties of the suspension.  ""In light of the suspension of the registration of the Fiji First Party, all twenty-four members are not entitled to take part in the proceedings of Parliament or any committee of Parliament for the duration of the suspension,"" it said.

The public prosecutor's office in Darmstadt said police had searched the private apartments of two journalists aged 46 and 51 in the western town of Moerfelden-Walldorf on suspicion of dangerous dissemination of personal data.  Investigators confiscated electronic storage media and other devices, the office said, adding that police had detained the two men but later released them.  ""The German ambassador in Turkey was called to the Turkish Foreign Ministry today for an interview,"" a source at Germany's foreign minister told Reuters.  Germany is home to the world's largest Turkish diaspora community, but relations between Berlin and Ankara have suffered in recent years over many issues including Germany's handling of the followers of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, blamed by Ankara for a 2016 failed coup and labelled a terrorist organisation in Turkey.  Germany's refusal to extradite military officers whom Turkey accuses of participating in the coup attempt, after they claimed asylum, has enraged Ankara.  The Turkish state-owned Anadolu news agency reported that German police had raided the Frankfurt office of the Turkish daily Sabah before detaining the journalists.  The Turkish Foreign Ministry said the journalists had been detained because of their reporting on the Gulen network after a complaint by one of its members.  Germany interior ministry was not immediately available to comment on the case.

Advertising Read more  However MFP leader Pita Limjaroenrat's determination to modify the lese-majeste laws protecting King Maha Vajiralongkorn has quickly emerged as a key issue that could block his path to power.  The monarchy has long had an exalted status in Thai society, and is shielded from criticism by section 112 of the penal code, which punishes infractions with jail terms of up to 15 years.  Posters of the king are ubiquitous, from shops and homes to public buildings and motorway billboards, and cinema-goers are expected to stand for the royal anthem before screenings.  But youth-led pro-democracy demonstrators in 2020 breached the taboo against public discussion of the monarchy's status, with some protesters calling for the king's power and spending to be reined in.  MFP channelled the reforming zeal of the protest movement in its campaign for Sunday's election, pledging to limit who can bring lese-majeste charges and to cut the maximum sentence.  - Tough laws -  Critics say the law is abused to silence political dissent, and prosecutions rocketed in the years after the 2014 coup that brought Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha to power.  Section 112 outlaws defaming, insulting or threatening the king or certain members of his family.  But its interpretation has expanded to include almost any criticism, whether in public or on social media, including even indirect or lighthearted references.  Since the 2020 protests erupted more than 200 people have been prosecuted, including minors, some for seemingly trivial transgressions.  Earlier this year a man was jailed for two years for selling satirical calendars featuring yellow rubber ducks that a court ruled insulted the king.  MFP proposes to cut the maximum sentence for lese-majeste and restrict who can bring charges -- at the moment it can be done by anyone, and ultra-royalists are known to trawl social media looking for potential complaints to file.  Pita insists the changes are needed to heal rifts in Thai society, and that Move Forward will not eradicate the law.  ""We want to amend, not abolish, act 112, which can be done in the parliament,"" he said.  ""We would like to talk maturely in the parliament, and we will do it slowly but surely and thoroughly.""  But in the past the army has used even the suggestion of disloyalty to the crown as grounds to launch a coup.  The generals ousted elected governments in 2006 and 2014, promising both times to get tough on elements threatening the monarchy.  And the current, military-written constitution makes it extremely difficult for Pita to become prime minister, even though Move Forward won the most seats.  MFP and rival opposition party Pheu Thai are working on a multi-party coalition that would give them more than 300 out of 500 lower house seats.  But to secure the prime minister's job the coalition needs a majority across both houses -- including the Senate.  The 250 members of the Senate -- monarchist, pro-military arch-conservatives, hand-picked by Prayut's junta -- are threatening to block Pita's bid for the job.  ""I disapprove despite the number of MPs he gathered,"" Senator Jadet Inswang said.  ""I will not accept Pita as a PM because he... has previously said that he would abolish 112. I can't accept.""  Cycle of unrest  But given the results of the election, the issue is now part of the political debate regardless of whether Pita becomes prime minister, according to Napon Jatusripitak, a political scientist and researcher at the Yusof Ishak Institute.  ""I think there is going to be some political space for amending the lese-majeste clause, regardless of whether the MFP ends up in the government or not,"" Napon told AFP.  ""This election has sort of been a quiet referendum on that issue.""  Rejecting a prime minister chosen by a coalition government with such a large electoral mandate could plunge the country into a fresh crisis, with protesters likely to flood the streets.  This would reignite the cycle of elections, street protests and coups that have dogged Thailand for two decades, fomenting instability and hampering progress.  And despite the challenges facing them, many MFP supporters feel the dam has already been broken.  ""This election was a slap in the face of the older generation, the old mindset, the old belief, and the old politics -- the status quo has been demolished,"" Panussaya Sitthijirawattanakul, a 2020 protest leader hit with multiple lese-majeste charges, told AFP.  © 2023 AFP"

The crisis in Sudan is in its fifth week with no end in sight.  Neither the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) nor the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have been able to gain decisive victories in the capital, Khartoum.  But their inability to overpower each other is not totally surprising. Instead, it is largely a byproduct of longtime President Omar al-Bashir’s strategy of rule in a country that has witnessed 16 failed and successful coup attempts since its independence.  Having come to power through a military coup himself in 1989, al-Bashir needed to keep his own army in check without rendering it too weak to maintain his hold on power. A sizable paramilitary is seen as reducing the risk of military coups because it shifts executive power away from a regular military to add a layer of protection against foreseeable mutinies.  For one state to have two sizable, quasi-independent armed forces is extremely risky and only works if these armed forces fulfil different functions to counterbalance each other.  The RSF pitted against the SAF  Numbers on the size of Sudan’s army and the RSF vary widely. The SAF is estimated to have about 200,000 active personnel compared with the RSF, where estimates range from 70,000-150,000.  With the constitutional task of upholding domestic order and contributing to the country’s development, the SAF is the coercive backbone of Sudan’s political system. Under al-Bashir, military spending accounted for up to 29 percent of Sudanese government expenditures.  Al-Bashir ruled Sudan for 30 years until the military removed him in April 2019 on the back of months-long popular protests. After months of wrangling, the new ruling generals agreed in August 2019 to share power with civilians representing the protest movement during a transitional period before elections.  But in October 2021, Sudan’s fragile democratisation process came to an abrupt end when the leader of the army, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the RSF commander, Mohamed Hamdan “Hemedti” Dagalo, seized total power in a coup. Cracks, however, soon emerged as the pro-democracy protests continued and the thorny issue of the RSF’s integration into the regular army remained unsolved.  Cameron Hudson, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that in terms of their equipment and training, “[the] SAF are a conventional African army in the sense that their order of battle is in the domain of heavy weaponry and armour. They have tanks, armoured personnel carriers, and they have an air force which gives them air superiority.”  According to the SIPRI Arms Transfers Database, in the last decade, Belarus, China, Russia, and Ukraine were the SAF’s most important suppliers of aircraft, missiles and armoured vehicles. A United Nations arms embargo imposed in 2004 in response to violence in the Sudanese region of Darfur had disrupted supply chains for the SAF’s weapons.  “They struggled to keep their equipment operating because they could not get spare parts. Sudan is also a punishing environment for sophisticated weaponry because of the sand and heat. Equipment and maintenance were a challenge [for the SAF]”, Hudson said.  The RSF, on the other hand, is a non-conscripted force that was formally set up as an extension and counterweight to the SAF a decade ago, evolving from the so-called Janjaweed militias under the auspices of al-Bashir to combat secessionism in Darfur.  In 2015, the RSF was officially incorporated into the state’s coercive apparatus under the command of Hemedti, subjugated only under al-Bashir and his National Intelligence and Security Service.  Like the Janjaweed, members of the RSF were recruited by Hemedti from Arab tribes in Darfur. This makes the RSF culturally, ethnically and religiously more cohesive than the conscripted corps of the SAF.  The RSF also has its own revenue streams; private companies owned by Hemedti and members of his family, including holdings in gold mining, livestock and infrastructure.      In contrast to the SAF, the Janjaweed’s chief purpose was targeted armed campaigns against non-Arabs in remote areas. The RSF retained the Janjaweed’s tactical setup as a mobile guerrilla and counterinsurgency force. Domestically, it has previously fought in Kordofan, the Blue Nile State and Khartoum in 2019; outside Sudan, RSF members have fought against the Houthi rebels in Yemen.  In terms of weapons, the RSF uses some government-supplied arms, though it is also known to confiscate weaponry and vehicles from other militia.  “They are much more lightweight, using light armoured jeeps like Thatchers or Toyota Hilux vehicles with 50-calibre machine guns on them,” Hudson said. “The RSF was allowed to diverge and to sustain itself because it played a role that the SAF did not want to play. The SAF has often mobilised militia around the country to do the dirty work and hand-to-hand combat that they did not want to do or could not do.”  Hemedti’s political ambitions  As long as the RSF specialised in armed campaigns outside Khartoum, it could grow without directly challenging the SAF’s traditional political hegemony.  But the alliance between al-Burhan and Hemedti during the 2019 and 2021 coups disrupted the fragile co-existence of the two forces. Ultimately, analysts say Hemedti’s political ambitions pulled the RSF towards the centre of political power, trespassing into the SAF’s political domain.  With al-Burhan unable to rebuild a political base that would anchor his regime, the RSF’s original role as mutiny insurance devolved into a serious coup risk. The differences in the SAF’s and RSF’s internal organisation, equipment, and specialisation kept both armed forces in check until major disagreements emerged in March over a planned security sector reform aimed at restructuring the military. The intended merger of the RSF into the regular army would have eliminated the paramilitary force as a substantive coup risk while absorbing its firepower and reach in the country’s periphery.  “Usually, there is the risk of power struggles after coups. But coup plotters would find ways to mitigate them before attempting a coup,” researcher Jonathan Powell, from the University of Central Florida, said.  “New incumbents appease potential rivals early on, allocate ministries differently, or assign individuals to political posts far away from the political capital where they cannot cause trouble,” Powell explained.  If fighting does break out from within the military establishment, it is usually short-lived and ends in a quick and clear winner. “It is bizarre that a regime would let an armed force like the RSF become a serious rival in the political capital,” Powell said.  As the sticky matter of the RSF’s integration heated up in the weeks before the fighting, Powell noted that “it could have been that al-Burhan felt more secure in his position than he was.  “I would not discount the possibility that Al-Burhan’s lack of action was to avoid the clashes [between SAF and RSF] that we are seeing right now,” he added.  Khartoum’s urban setting is a problem for both SAF and RSF  With the fighting now in its second month, analysts say the urban setting of Khartoum poses a problem for both the RSF and SAF due to their combat histories and specialisations.  “[The SAF is] not known for being highly mobile on the ground, or even being precise with respect to their air force”, Hudson said.  The RSF, on the other hand, never had the same training as the army in defending fixed positions, holding territory, or sustaining attacks.  “The military can use long-range artillery and fighter jets to defend their positions. Up close they have tanks and heavy armour,” Hudson added. “The RSF is not positioned to hold territory and defend positions because it is configured like a guerilla force that strikes and retreats quickly.”  Many RSF recruits are also unfamiliar with the operational environment in the capital.  “These are people from the peripheral regions of the country with very little knowledge of the streets and neighbourhoods in Khartoum. The SAF has an advantage there because the SAF knows Khartoum. At the same time, the SAF is not mobile; it cannot defend positions reasonably well and it is not going to be able to chase the RSF around the city,” said Hudson.  Still, neither force appears to be adjusting its combat tactics to its surroundings.  Hudson pointed out that “the RSF uses the same tactics we know from the Janjaweed: they are pillaging, marauding, and looting in neighbourhoods”. With no established supply lines in Khartoum and their headquarters destroyed, Hudson said RSF fighters “go into people’s homes to steal food, water, supplies, and occupy [them]”.  Early in the crisis, meanwhile, reports surfaced that the Russian Wagner Group was lending tactical support to the RSF. Marcel Plichta, a research fellow at the Centre for Global Law and Governance, said that “there are claims on the use of Wagner aircraft or Wagner-operated airfields to lift material to the RSF, in particular portable surface-to-air missiles. From a military perspective, this niche capability is highly valuable to the RSF because al-Burhan controls the regular military’s air force and the RSF lack strong anti-aircraft capabilities”.  But Plichta cautioned that Wagner is still not a decisive force in this battle.  “The number of contractors currently active in Sudan is small compared to the tens of thousands of RSF and SAF personnel. The founder of the Wagner Group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, benefits from portraying it as more influential than it is. It is important to not overestimate the strength and influence of this group, as much as it is important to not downplay the harm it brings to civilians,” he said.  An exit from the conflict needs a decisive tactical win  Because the SAF and RSF were designed to be complementary rather than competing forces within one state, the conflict setting in Khartoum puts both in a deadlock, observers say. At the same time, the rift between al-Burhan and Hemedti has weakened state power.  The unclear situation on the ground deters political actors from intervening, in another blow to the already faltering democratic process.  “The coup in 2021 made it very clear that powerful figures in the security services were not willing to allow democratisation without serious preservation of their powers and the spoils they are getting from the system,” Powell said.  Hudson forecast that as long as neither RSF nor SAF has the upper hand, a chance for negotiations will not be in sight.  “I fear that neither of these sides wants to end the fighting,” he said.  “They have agreed to every ceasefire, though they did not implement them. What might create a real opening for dialogue is if one side is about to win. If one side gains a tactical advantage – like if the RSF is driven out of Khartoum – that might create a real opportunity for them to talk”."

At the same time, the right-wing group Mateh 64 organized a counter-protest march in support of the Haredi community. Ahead of the main march, which departed from Ramat Gan's Ayalon Mall, police closed roads in the area.  ""The ultra-Orthodox leadership is cooperating with the dictatorship with one hand, and the other hand is in the till,"" the organizers of the protest said in an apparent reference to the government's judicial plans. The Netanyahu government has agreed to provide 13.7 billion shekels ($3.8 billion) to meet the funding demands of its coalition's parties, including 230 million shekels for independent ultra-Orthodox educational institutions and a 150 million shekel increase in funding for food vouchers sought by the ultra-Orthodox Shas party.  The budget hikes for ultra-Orthodox community needs was initially penned in the coalition agreements that the two ultra-Orthodox parties struck to join the current government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu back in November.  Since the eruption of the mass protests against the government's plans to undermine the independence of the judiciary, there have been several protests targeting Bnei Brak. About two months ago, dozens of protesters demonstrated in front of the home of Moshe Gafni, the United Torah Judaism lawmaker who is chairman of the Knesset's Finance Committee. Residents shot firecrackers at the demonstrators and clashed with police. Four residents were arrested on suspicion of attacking protesters.  As the largest ultra-Orthodox Tel Aviv suburb, Bnei Brak has been the target of protest not only over increased government funding for Israel's ultra-Orthodox population but also due to the exemption of draft-aged ultra-Orthodox yeshiva students from compulsory military service. Israel's high court has ruled that the exemption is a violation of the principle of equality before the law, but legislation changing the law has yet to be passed.  Ultra-Orthodox lawmakers have sought the passage of a Basic Law, with constitutional standing, that would enshrine Torah study as a fundamental value in its own right."

A joint statement issued by the Ministry of Interior, the State Security Service, and the Prosecutor General's Office on May 16 revealed that the suspects ""were working for Iranian secret services.""  They are accused of seeking to ""disrupt stability"" in the South Caucasus country by disseminating ""religious propaganda.""  The statement said that Ruhollah Akhundzadeh and his son Al-Morsel Akhundzadeh, in collaboration with the Iranian special services, plotted ""to forcefully change the constitutional structure of the Republic of Azerbaijan and orchestrate armed rebellions with the objective to establish the ""Karima"" state, and to organize assassination attempts on prominent personalities and senior officials,"" the statement reads.  The two men formed clandestine groups on WhatsApp, Telegram and other instant messaging systems, and provided members of the group with a list of government officials and prominent figures, along with their residential and workplace addresses, in order to organize their assassinations.  Azerbaijani media reported that Akhundzadeh intended to send members of the group to Iran, under the guise of religious education, to receive military training.  Last month, Azerbaijani news agencies reported the alleged arrest of the leaders of a group called ""Hosseiniun"" in the Iranian city of Qom.  Tohid Ebrahim Beigli and Orkhan Mamedov are accused by Azerbaijani authorities of planning to establish the ""Karima"" state in Azerbaijan.  In late 2015, Ebrahim Beigli formed the ""Hosseiniun Brigade"" (Hosseinchiler) with 14 Azerbaijani students who were studying in Qom and Mashhad.  The aim of the group was to fight against the ISIS extremist group in Syria and prepare for an armed conflict in Azerbaijan.  In late 2015, Ebrahim Beigli, along with 14 students from the Republic of Azerbaijan who were studying in Qom and Mashhad, formed the ""Hosseiniun Brigade,"" with the stated objective of fighting against the ISIS extremist group in Syria and prepare for an armed conflict in Azerbaijan.  Who is Ruhollah Akhundzadeh?  Ruhollah Akhundzadeh, the deputy of the Islamic Party of Azerbaijan, was sentenced to 11 years in prison in 2011. Following his release, he traveled to Iran in 2020 where he has been actively involved in organizing religious extremist groups closely associated with the Islamic Republic.  The State Security Service of Azerbaijan issued a statement in November last year saying it had conducted an operation against an illegal armed group which operated under the guidance of the Iranian intelligence services. Akhundzadeh was apprehended during the operation.  In the past year alone, Akhundzadeh, with the support of the intelligence agencies of the Islamic Republic, has reportedly made two attempts to establish an armed group aimed at carrying out acts of sabotage and terrorism in Azerbaijan.  According to the newspaper Mosavat, the intelligence agencies of the Islamic Republic are secretly promoting religious extremist ideas in Azerbaijan to encourage citizens to participate in military exercises abroad and finance their activities.  Lasting Tensions Between the Two Neighbors  Baku and Tehran have often had strained relations, with Azerbaijan accusing the Islamic Republic of trying to destabilize the country. Azerbaijan also criticizes Iran for allegedly backing Armenia in the long-standing conflict over Azerbaijan's breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh region.  According to the Baku Post, Iranian intelligence agencies attempted to use Azerbaijani citizens to act against Azerbaijan's interests and in favor of Armenia during the 44-day war between the two countries over Nagorno-Karabakh in 2020.  In turn, Tehran has long accused Baku of fueling separatist sentiments among its sizeable ethnic Azeri minority. The Islamic Republic also fears that Azerbaijani territory could be used for a possible attack against Iran by Israel.  The Azerbaijani authorities strongly reacted to military maneuvers conducted by the Islamic Republic along the Azerbaijan border, calling them provocative and unacceptable.  Tensions between the two neighbors escalated over the past months following a ""terrorist attack"" on the Azerbaijani Embassy in Tehran, the arrest of individuals affiliated with Iranian intelligence services on charges of espionage, the assassination attempt on a member of an Azerbaijani lawmaker, the expulsion of diplomats from both nations, and the opening of an Azerbaijani embassy in Israel.  ""Iran Seeks to Regain Influence"" in the South Caucasus  ""Over the past 30 years, Iran has consistently sought to interfere in Azerbaijan's internal affairs,"" university professor and political analyst Nazem Jafar Soy tells IranWire.  ""This has included sending mullahs to Azerbaijan, influencing the youth of the country through religious teachings in Iran, engaging in espionage, and exploiting the religious sentiments of the Azerbaijani people,"" he added.

We confess our wrongdoings, and we confess that we have hurt so many of our people in Fiji, particularly those of the Indo-Fijian community of the time and among them sons, daughters, grandsons and granddaughters of those who were indentured as labourers from India between 1879 and 1916,” Rabuka said in the country’s capital, Suva.  Rabuka, who was then an army lieutenant colonel, entered Fiji’s parliament, arrested Prime Minister Bavadra, and suspended the constitution. The takeover, the first of several military coups in Fiji, was driven by indigenous Fijians’ fear of losing political control to Indo-Fijians, who dominated the country’s economy.  Rabuka’s action had far-reaching and long-term consequences for Fiji, and altered its relationship with the rest of the world, especially India.  The May 1987 coup  On the morning of May 14, 1987, Rabuka, who was accompanied by 10 masked soldiers, stormed the parliament building, herded Bavadra and 27 members of the ruling coalition into a waiting truck, and drove them to an unknown destination.

Advertisement  Meanwhile, the country’s Governor General Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau declared a national emergency and announced he was taking charge of the government under the provisions of Fiji’s British-made Constitution. Fiji was a member of the British Commonwealth (the country has been in and out of the British Commonwealth over the years. It was most recently reinstated as a member in 2014) at the time, Queen Elizabeth II was the head of state, and Penaia Ganilau was officially her representative.  The coup took place a little over a month after an alliance of the National Federation Party and Labour Party won elections that led to the formation of a cabinet dominated by ethnic Indians for the first time since Fiji’s independence from Britain in 1970.  Paper cutting of The Indian Express from May 15, 1987. Paper cutting of The Indian Express from May 15, 1987.  A day after his takeover, Lt Col Rabuka announced he was drafting a new constitution that would guarantee Fiji would never again have an Indian-dominated government (‘No Power for Indians: Rabuka’, The Indian Express, May 16, 1987). He denied discriminating against Indians, and claimed that he was only “looking after the Fijians’ interest”.  Advertisement  On May 19, anti-Indian riots broke out in the country. “[A] crowd of ethnic Fijians ran through the streets of Suva in an hour-long rampage, attacking Indians and Indian-owned shops” despite Rabuka’s appeals for calm, The Indian Express reported on May 20. At least 50 Indians were reported injured in the violence that was provoked by a rally that Indians took out in support of the ousted Prime Minister.  Also in Explained | 25th anniversary of Pokhran-II: India’s journey to become a nuclear power  Rabuka’s second coup  Widespread racial violence followed the military takeover, wrote academic Dr Amba Pande in an article published in Strategic Analysis, a monthly journal of Columbia University (Race and Power Struggle in Fiji). Pande wrote that an attempt by the governor-general to form an advisory council with both Bavadra and Rabuka failed after the ousted Prime Minister refused to participate “on the grounds that the composition of the council was unconstitutional and biased”.  Following weeks of negotiations, in July 1987, plans to reform the constitution were approved, and it was decided that Bavadra and Kamisese Mara — a former Prime Minister popular with indigenous Fijians — would form an interim government.  In response, Rabuka orchestrated a second coup on September 25 of that year. He declared Fiji a republic, and proclaimed himself head of the state, replacing the Queen. Countries around the world condemned these actions and refused to recognise his regime, and India imposed trade sanctions on Fiji.  Advertisement  Under pressure, Rabuka resigned as head of state on December 6, 1987, and Penaia Ganilau became the first President of the Fijian republic. A new constitution was promulgated in 1990, and elections were held two years later.  Background of crisis  The election victory of the Indo-Fijians was only a trigger for Rabuka’s coup. Since independence, the South Pacific Ocean archipelago had been seeing a widening political divide between ethnic Indians and indigenous Fijians.  Advertisement  Indians were brought to Fiji from 1879 onward as “girmitiyas” or indentured labour transported to work in sugar plantations. The majority of these Indians stay back after the indenture system ended and, over time, gained prosperity. The Indian community eventually became the backbone of Fiji’s economic system, and they had, by the 1940s, outnumbered ethnic Fijians in the islands’ population.  Another reason for the Fijians’ resentment was the nature of landholdings. Indigenous Fijians owned more than 83% of the land on the islands, but Indian tenant farmers held most of it on 99-year leases, according to Pande’s article. “Despite the fact that the land was legally made inalienable by the constitution of 1970, the fear of losing it had always been there in the minds of the Fijians,” Pande wrote.  Advertisement  All these insecurities came to a boil after the general elections of 1987, and a section of indigenous Fijians sought to thwart Indo-Fijians from getting political power. Rabuka’s two coups triggered a massive wave of emigration — according to a report published by The Guardian in 2000, around 70,000 Indians fled the country to “escape the oppression”.  Monday’s apology by Rabuka — who was elected Prime Minister in 1992 and then again last year — was not his first for the 1987 coups. He had apologised publicly on the 21st anniversary of the takeover in 2008. “It was a mistake and I admit I was wrong…Staging a coup is something no one should be proud of because you don’t become a hero, so all the copycats should not think they will be heroes,” he said on that occasion, according to a Reuters report."

Five people are going on trial in Germany on Wednesday over their alleged participation in a plot to kidnap the country’s health minister and overthrow the government in a far-right coup.  Four men, aged 44 to 56, and a woman, 75, are accused of treason and of founding or being members of a terrorist organization.  Federal prosecutors say the group is linked to the Reich Citizens community, which rejects the legitimacy of Germany’s postwar constitution and has similarities to the Sovereign Citizens and QAnon movements in the U.S.  Advertisement  Prosecutors say the five defendants intended to create “conditions similar to civil war” by using explosives to cause nationwide blackouts, then kidnapping Health Minister Karl Lauterbach — a prominent advocate of strict coronavirus measures.  There were no indications that the group, which called itself United Patriots, was close to launching a coup attempt. But prosecutors said the group’s procurement of weapons and money showed they were “dangerous criminals who wanted to implement their plans.”  The men, whose names weren’t released for privacy reasons, were arrested in April last year. Police at the time seized 22 firearms, including a Kalashnikov rifle, and hundreds of rounds of ammunition, as well as large sums of cash, gold and silver.  The woman, who was arrested six months later, is alleged to have drafted numerous documents for the group, including an “arrest warrant” for Lauterbach. The retired teacher also wrote letters addressed to Russian President Vladimir Putin and Polish President Andrzej Duda.  Lauterbach told German weekly Der Spiegel that he hopes for a “hard, fair verdict” that would deter others from planning similar plots.  The case is separate from that of the more than two dozen people arrested in December, also on suspicion of planning to topple the government.

On the surface, everything looked good early on. Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo came out aggressive scoring 14 of the HEAT’s first 17 points. Kyle Lowry scored 13 points in the second quarter. Everything was falling outside the paint. Three. Mid-range. You name it, it was going in. Midway through the second quarter, the score was knotted.  Problem was, the vast majority of the HEAT’s offense was coming from the outside, and the majority of those opportunities were self-created, non-assisted. Boston’s switching scheme wasn’t slowing them down, but it was keeping bodies out of the paint. Unlike against Milwaukee’s drop-back scheme, the jumpers weren’t off the comfortable, walk-on-in variety – Butler’s four mid-range makes in the first quarter were one off his season high for an entire contest. Meanwhile, the Celtics were punishing the paint much as the New York Knicks did in Game 1 of that series. Unlike the Knicks, Boston was actually hitting a few threes. After a few stagnant possessions from the HEAT, the Celtics ran off an 8-0 run capped off by an Al Horford triple, and went into the half up 66-57, outscoring Miami 40-16 in the paint with Marcus Smart posting 10 assists.  Of course, four minutes into the third it was tied because the HEAT just kept hitting all their shots, just as they did against the Bucks, because they stopped turning the ball over, because Adebayo was incredible and because Miami started to earn more points in the paint while preventing them on the other end. By the end of that 46-point quarter – the highest scoring quarter in franchise postseason history – with Miami stringing together multiple threes to close it out, it was HEAT by 12.  Boston isn’t a team to fold. About 90 seconds into the fourth, they had closed it to five on a 7-0 run. As they have so often in this postseason, Miami held out a stiff arm, holding the lead and answering every punch with a made shot. Five minutes to go, the lead remained five, Butler quieting the crowd as he picked off Boston’s cross-court passes. In the end, it was the makes. It had to be the makes. Caleb Martin and Butler putting Miami up 10 with under two minutes to play with another pair of threes essentially decided it, Boston – with just 22 paint points in the second half – coming up short despite multiple chances to make it a one possession game. HEAT take Game 1, 123-116.  2. Coming into this series, it was expected that Boston would likely win the Shot Quality – the actual statistical measurement – category on most nights. They were among the league leaders in catch-and-shoot threes in part because they had so many players who could attack, drive and pass. Outside of the Warriors, if there was a team built to put up a mathematically efficient shot profile every night, it was Boston.  All that said, the way that particular relationship played out in Game 1 was not to expectations. Miami has long been a team that prioritizes keeping the ball out of the paint even if it means giving up some threes, but it was almost as if their scheme had been turned on its head in those first two quarters. The perimeter closeouts were excellent as far as meeting the pass at the shooter and keeping the three-point volume down (13 attempts through two quarters), but Boston was driving those closeouts and getting into the teeth of the defense and through it. Just as it was against the Knicks, allowing 40 paint points in a half is a highly, highly unusual occurrence for this HEAT group.  Shot profile also doesn’t matter if you keep hitting all your shots, and Miami shot 16-of-31 from deep and 11-of-16 on long two-point jumpers. The shots came about in different ways, but this was exactly what Miami did to Milwaukee – make what you get, whatever you get. We don’t have the numbers as of this writing, but Game 1 against Milwaukee was one of the single best shotmaking games – actual percentages over expected percentages based on opportunities – in recent league postseason history. This one will probably rival that, if not exceed it.  3. Due to Boston’s switching, this was always going to be a Butler and Adebayo series. Sure, you can beat switches with slips and double screens. You can induce miscommunications and you can attack the seams left open mid-switch. But at the end of the day you’re going to have to be able to score one-on-one for sustained half-court success, and Butler and Adebayo are the guys who are most reliably going to score one-on-one."

In a statement directed at Petro, Marulanda said they are going to “defenestrate a guy who was a guerrilla."" Those comments came a day after hundreds of Colombia’s military veterans protested against Petro in Bogota. Since taking office on August 7, 2022, the relationship between former socialist guerrilla Petro, who is Colombia’s first ever leftwing president, and the public forces, which have experienced substantial resignations, has been particularly strained. Since then, fears have emerged that Colombia’s armed forces, a politically influential body with close ties to former hard-right President Alvaro Uribe, will not accept a former socialist guerrilla as president.  The political intrigues and conflict playing out in Bogota, long a focal point for clashes between the extreme left and right, are being fanned by considerable unease in the upper socioeconomic levels of Colombian society over a one-time leftwing revolutionary holding the office of president. As a young man, Petro joined the socialist M19 guerrilla movement, founded after the disputed and allegedly fraudulent 1970 presidential election. During his time with the M19 Petro was imprisoned and according to him tortured. After the group disbanded as part of the March 1990 peace deal - where Petro was a negotiator - struck with the government of President Virgilio Barco, he held various government appointments. Petro then went on to become a congressional representative in 2002 and a senator in 2006. After two earlier failed attempts to win Colombia’s presidency, in 2010 and 2018, Petro finally succeeded during the 2022 election.  Tensions are further heightened in Colombia because of the impact of the fallout from the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic with the Andean country struggling to recover from spiraling poverty, crime, and violence. By the end of 2021, nearly 40% of Colombians were living in poverty (Spanish) compared to 36% in 2019, while 12% of the population was living in extreme poverty against just under 10% 2 years earlier. Petro’s predecessor President Ivan Duque ignited a tinderbox of simmering community resentment in April 2021 when he announced plans to hike taxes subsequently triggering Colombia-wide violent anti-government protests.  After emerging victorious during the July 2022 presidential run-off, Petro announced his ambitious yet what increasingly appears to be an unachievable plan for total peace. This focuses on obliging the state policy to seek peace with the disparate illegal armed groups engaged in Colombia’s decades-long bloody civil conflict that has claimed 262,000 lives, the vast majority of whom were civilians. It is this low-level asymmetric war which is responsible for much of the violence occurring in the strife-torn country, notably in remote rural regions. As part of that plan, Petro prematurely declared a ceasefire at the start of 2023, but it was not recognized by the numerous illegal armed groups operating in Colombia which continued attacking crucial infrastructure, civilians, and the armed forces. That only heightened tensions with the military and police which have borne much of the brunt of the uptick in violence.  Petro, to the displeasure of the hard-right and many within the armed forces, resumed peace talks with the last remaining leftist guerrillas the National Liberation Army, known by its Spanish initials ELN. His predecessor Duque suspended negotiations (Spanish) with the guerrillas after their January 2019 bombing of a Bogota police academy claimed 21 lives. The ELN, which was founded in 1964, is believed to have as many as 2,500 combatants making it the second largest illegal armed group in Colombia after the Gulf Clan, a neo-paramilitary group that has an estimated 5,000 fighters. The Gulf Clan emerged in 2006 when senior paramilitary leader Vincente Castaño broke away from the demobilization process of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC – Spanish initials) and rearmed a paramilitary group. After clashing with a variety of other illegal armed groups the Gulf Clan emerged as Colombia’s most powerful criminal organization. There are also various bands of combatants from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC – Spanish initials) who didn’t accept the 2016 peace accord with Bogota.  There have been frequent scandals and allegations concerning Colombia’s police and army’s involvement in human rights abuses, illegal detention, torture, extrajudicial killings, and rampant corruption over the last two decades. The most severe instances occurred during the 2021 national strike where thousands of Colombians took to the streets to protest against President Duque’s proposed tax hikes, soaring corruption, and economic mismanagement. The crisis of impunity among Colombia’s public forces is so severe that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR – Spanish initials) expressed concerns over endemic police violence in Colombia in 2021. Petro’s desire to secure peace, eliminate corruption, and end the impunity enjoyed by Colombia’s armed forces and police when it comes to human rights abuses saw him appoint controversial prominent anti-corruption investigator Iván Velásquez as Minister of Defense. That further inflamed tensions with Colombia’s armed forces.  This is all occurring at a time when there is considerable rumor and innuendo about a rightwing campaign by various former senior security officials as well as business leaders and supporters of former President Uribe to undermine Petro’s presidency. While Petro has been able to maintain an overall semblance of a functional relationship with Colombia’s Armed Forces despite evident tensions, his relationship with retired members of the military has been strained and antagonistic. Regardless of the issues discussed, Colombia’s active military has, thus far, shown no interest in Marulanda’s comments. Petro ridiculed the statement and warned the Colombian people of the threat writing via Twitter “Why are they conspiring for a coup d’état? Because they are terrified that we will put an end to impunity.” Indeed, the retired colonel later walked back his comments claiming that he was referring to the President of Peru Pedro Castillo, who was ousted from office during the first week of December 2022 to be later arrested and detained.  While a coup certainly appears unlikely with Marulanda’s comments appearing to amount to nothing more than saber rattling, Colombia’s Attorney General’s Office has opened an investigation (Spanish) to determine whether a crime has been committed. They have also inflamed tensions at a crucial time for Petro whose controversial health reforms, aimed at establishing a centralized government-monitored payment system to reduce corruption and improve care, were rejected. After the clashes over his health reform proposals, the president replaced seven ministers in his cabinet who were seen by many as moderates. There are also accusations that retired military members protested to create a distraction from the explosive testimony from paramilitary leader Salvatore Mancuso before the Special Jurisdiction for Peace. That includes claims of close ties between paramilitary forces, the Army, and police as well as their participation in extrajudicial killings.

Advertising Read more  Since the military seized power and jailed democratic leaders, some opponents of military rule have taken up arms, in places joining ethnic minority insurgents, and the military has responded with air strikes and heavy weapons, including in civilian areas.  Russian-made Mi-35 helicopter, MiG-29 fighter jets and Yak-130 light aircraft, and Chinese K-8 jets, have been most frequently used to conduct air strikes that have hit schools, medical facilities, homes and other civilian sites, said the report by Tom Andrews, the UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in Myanmar.  A single attack on a village gathering organized by the military's opponents in Sagaing region on April 11 killed at least 160 people, reportedly including nearly 40 children, the report said.  Myanmar’s military says it is targeting insurgents and after the Sagaing attack said any civilians killed were probably supporters of opponents it calls ""terrorists.""  “The good news is we now know who is supplying these arms and the jurisdictions in which they operate,” Andrews said in a statement, calling for UN members to “step up and stop the flow of arms” with a complete ban on the arms transfers to Myanmar’s military, enforcement of existing bans and coordinated sanctions.  The UN expert used trade data to detail transfers of arms and other goods, including raw materials for Myanmar’s domestic arms production, to the military since the coup worth $406 million from Russia and $267 million from China, including from state-owned entities in both countries.  State-owned entities in India also made a smaller volume of transfers, and companies in Singapore, India and Thailand were also involved in transfers to the military.  Some $227 million of material came from Rosoboronexport, Moscow’s state-owned arms exporter, which has transferred SU-30 fighter jets, supplies for MiG-29 jets and rocket launch systems to Myanmar, the report said.  Other Russian companies provided a range of tools, equipment and spare parts for Russian-supplied weapons systems, it said.  “Weaponry provided by Russian suppliers has been used to commit probable war crimes and crimes against humanity in Myanmar,” the report said.

Myanmar’s military government is urging people fighting against its rule to surrender their weapons, offering a cash reward if they do so along with the possibility of reduced sentences if they broke the law. The official announcement was made in the edition of the Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper Wednesday, May 10. (AP Photo/Aung Shine Oo, File)  UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Myanmar’s military has imported at least $1 billion worth of weapons and related material from Russia, China and other countries since its February 2021 coup, some of which it has used to carry out atrocities against civilians, according to a U.N. report released Wednesday.  The weapons continue to flow to the military despite overwhelming evidence of its responsibility for the atrocities, including some that amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, said Tom Andrews, the U.N. independent investigator on human rights in Myanmar.  As an example of what he called the junta’s brutality, Andrews pointed to its April 11 airstrike using a Russian Yak-130 fighter jet on a ceremony attended by some 300 opponents of army rule, which was quickly followed by an attack by Russian Mi-35 helicopters on those who came to help. He said at least 160 people were killed, including many children.  In addition, the machine guns and bombs used in the attacks included parts and materials from companies located in Singapore, China and Thailand, he said.  Myanmar is mired in strife because of a political crisis unleashed when the military took power. Its takeover prompted widespread peaceful protests that security forces suppressed with deadly force, triggering armed resistance throughout the country that the army has been unable to quell. Andrews said at least 22,000 political prisoners have been detained since the coup, at least 3.500 civilians have been killed and 1.5 million people have been forcibly displaced.  The report documents over 12,500 purchases that were shipped directly to the Myanmar military or known Myanmar arms dealers working for the military from Feb. 1, 2021, when the military ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, until December 2022, Andrews said at a news conference.  He said the volume and diversity of equipment the military received was “staggering,” ranging from fighter jets and attack helicopters and drones to advanced missile systems, tank upgrades, sophisticated communications equipment, radar complexes and components for naval ships.  Andrews, a former Democratic congressman from Maine , said he had received “highly credible and detailed information from confidential sources” identifying the major networks and companies involved in the arms trade with Myanmar.  The report to the Geneva-based Human Rights Council identifies $406 million in weapons and material that went to the Myanmar military from Russia, $267 million from China, $254 million from Singapore, $51 million from India and $28 million from Thailand.  Since the coup, the report said, 28 Russian private and state-owned companies have transferred fighter jets and their spare parts, advanced missile systems, reconnaissance and attack drones, attack helicopters and other systems to the junta.  The report identified 41 private and state-owned companies registered in China and Hong Kong that supplied the Myanmar military with an extensive array of arms, equipment and raw materials between October 2021 and December 2022, including advanced trainer jets, light attack aircraft, tank upgrades and repairs for Chinese fighter jets, which make up the Myanmar Air Force fleet, the report said.  They also supplied aluminum, copper, steel, rubber and lubricants for use in Myanmar’s domestic weapons manufacturing, it said.  Unlike with Russia and China, and to a lesser extent India, Andrews said he received no information indicating that the governments of Singapore or Thailand approved or transferred arms to the Myanmar military.  He said companies in Singapore are of critical importance to the junta, having supplied spare parts, raw materials and manufacturing equipment, especially for Myanmar’s KaPaSa weapons factories. Thai companies have done the same, the report said.  Twelve Thai companies were established after the coup, many by sanctioned arms networks already operating in Singapore, which suggests arms dealers may be looking at Thailand as an alternative route to avoid scrutiny, the report said.  Andrews said Singapore has a policy prohibiting the transfer of arms to Myanmar, and he reported his detailed findings to the government, which he said expressed appreciation for the information and indicated it was reviewing the effectiveness of its export controls.  If the Singapore government stopped all arms shipments to the Myanmar military, he said, the impact on the ability of the junta to manufacture arms “would be significant.”  Andrews said China and Russia both criticized the report, saying it went beyond his human rights mandate, and accused him of “vilifying legitimate arms trade.” He countered that “identifying the sources of gross human rights violations and atrocities, including crimes against humanity and war crimes, is within my mandate and in my moral obligation.”  Andrews said India responded to the report’s findings that 22 state-owned and private firms shipped a coastal surveillance system, a remote-controlled weapons system, components from an ammunition and missile manufacturer, and 122 mm howitzer barrels by saying these involved contracts with the previous civilian government.  A U.N. General Assembly resolution adopted on June 18, 2021, calls upon all member states to prevent the flow of arms into Myanmar, but unlike a Security Council resolution it is not legally binding.

Andrews said the sanctions weren’t coordinated and have been largely ineffective. He called for countries to impose coordinated sanctions that target the networks that procure weapons and also the junta’s finances."

Myanmar’s military has imported arms worth at least $1bn since seizing power in February 2021, despite “overwhelming evidence of its responsibility for atrocity crimes”, a United Nations expert has said.  Most of the weapons came from Russia, China and companies in Singapore, Tom Andrews, the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Myanmar said in a report [PDF] released on Wednesday in New York.  The exports cover weapons, dual-use technology and materials used to manufacture weapons exported from the day of the coup on February 1, 2021, to December 2022.  “These weapons, and the materials to manufacture more of them, have continued to flow uninterrupted to the Myanmar military despite overwhelming evidence of its responsibility for atrocity crimes,” said the report. It identified more than 12,500 unique purchases or recorded shipments directly to the Myanmar military or known Myanmar arms dealers working on the military’s behalf.  “The diversity and volume of goods provided to the Myanmar military since the coup is staggering,” it added, saying the military had taken delivery of weapons and equipment from fighter jets to drones, communications equipment and components for navy ships.  Myanmar was plunged into crisis by the coup, which triggered mass protests. A deadly crackdown ignited armed resistance, with ethnic armed groups that have long been fighting the military joining forces with so-called People’s Defence Forces (PDFs) to fight against the generals.  The PDFs are aligned with the National Unity Government (NUG) established by legislators removed in the coup and others opposed to military rule.      The UN and rights groups have accused the military of human rights abuses in its attempts to suppress opposition, saying some incidents may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity.  In his report to the UN’s Human Rights Council in Geneva, Andrews pointed to last month’s attack on Pazigyi village in the central Sagaing region, where reports indicate near-daily confrontations between resistance forces and soldiers.  As some 300 villagers, including children, gathered to mark the opening of a new NUG office, a Russian-made Yak-130 fighter jet dropped two 250kg (550 pounds) bombs on the crowd.  “The ordinance detonated with deadly impact – ripping the bodies of men, women, and children open, turning their skin to ash, and inflicting critical shrapnel wounds,” the report said.  Amid the carnage, the attack continued as two Mi-35 attack helicopters fired on the survivors and those trying to help the wounded.  At least 160 people were killed and the remains of only 59 people were identifiable, the report noted.  “The attack is yet another example of the Myanmar junta’s probable crimes against humanity and war crimes against the people of Myanmar,” it said.  No doubt about buyer  According to the report, Russian entities were the source of $406m of the arms and related-equipment, China entities $254m and Singapore-operating entities $254m.  Armaments were also sent from entities in India ($51m) and Thailand ($28m).  State-owned entities in Russia, China and India were among those Andrews identified as exporters.  “Over $947 million of arms-related trade identified went directly to entities controlled by the Myanmar military—e.g., the Directorate of Procurement, Directorate of Defense Industries, or specific branches of the military like the Myanmar Air Force or Tatmadaw Basic Training School,” the report said.  “This means that the military itself was listed as recipient on trade-related documents, eliminating any doubt of who the end recipient would be.”      Andrews said he had shared his findings with the relevant governments.  In their response, Russia and China accused the rapporteur of going beyond his mandate and “vilifying legitimate arms trade”.  India, meanwhile, said the arms contracts involving state-owned companies had been signed by a previous government.  Andrews noted that he had found no information indicating that entities owned or controlled by the governments of Singapore or Thailand, or the governments themselves, had approved or transferred the arms to the Myanmar military, and that it seemed arms dealers were using the territories to carry out their business “specifically the banking and shipping sectors”.  As a result of the report, the Singapore government indicated it was reviewing the effectiveness of its export controls, Andrews said."

REUTERS/Yves Herman  Tayyip Erdogan's presidential challenger appealed to young Turkish voters on Tuesday to support him in a May 28 election runoff, as he seeks to prevent the president extending his rule of NATO-member Turkey into a third decade.  Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the candidate of a six-party opposition alliance, won 45% support in Sunday's vote while Erdogan got 49.5%, falling just short of the majority needed to avoid a runoff of a vote seen as a referendum on his autocratic rule.  Turkish assets weakened for a second day, especially government and corporate bonds and banking stocks, as investors bet that Erdogan would win another five-year term and continue his unorthodox economic policies.  However, Kilicdaroglu, 74, sought to rally his supporters, many now downcast, putting a positive spin on the outcome.  ""A message of change emerged from the ballot box. Those who want change in this country are now more than those that don't want it,"" Kilicdaroglu said, referring to Erdogan falling short of 50%, in a series of tweets addressed to ""dear young people"".  In a parliamentary election held simultaneously, Erdogan's AK Party and its nationalist and Islamist partners won 322 of 600 seats in the new parliament, achieving a majority that will enable him to argue that voting for him will ensure stability.  'DARK TUNNEL'  Kilicdaroglu appealed to young voters with references to the cost-of-living crisis, which in Turkey has been much exacerbated by Erdogan's insistence on cutting interest rates, causing a sharp slide in the lira and soaring inflation.  ""You don't have enough money for anything,"" he said. ""Your joy of life was taken away. Whereas youth should be free of worry.""  ""You won't get your youth back again. We have 12 days to get out of this dark tunnel...,"" Kilicdaroglu added.  Kilicdaroglu has vowed to revive democracy after years of state repression, return to orthodox economic policies, empower institutions that lost autonomy under Erdogan and rebuild frayed ties with the West.  The vote is being closely followed in Washington, Europe and across the region, where Erdogan has asserted Turkish power. He has also strengthened ties to Russia, putting strain on Ankara's traditional alliance with the United States.  The European Union's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, called on Turkey on Tuesday to fix shortcomings in its election process that were identified by European observers.  In Sunday's presidential vote, nationalist candidate Sinan Ogan came third with 5.2% support and there will be much focus now on how his supporters will vote on May 28.  In a potential boost to Erdogan, Ogan told Reuters in an interview on Monday he would only endorse Kilicdaroglu in the runoff if the latter ruled out any concessions to a pro-Kurdish party, parliament's third largest.  That party, the HDP, backs Kilicdaroglu but is accused of ties to Kurdish militants, which it denies.  Opinion polls had shown Erdogan, 69, trailing Kilicdaroglu, but Sunday's outcome suggested he and his Islamist-rooted AK Party were able to rally conservative voters despite Turkey's economic woes.  Kilicdaroglu and his alliance want to restore a parliamentary system of government and scrap the powerful executive presidency introduced by Erdogan.  The AKP came first in Sunday's parliamentary vote with 267 lawmakers, followed by Kilicdaroglu's secularist CHP on 169 and the pro-Kurdish party on 61.  The prospect of five more years of Erdogan's rule will upset civil rights activists campaigning for reforms to undo the damage they say he has done to Turkey's democracy. He says he respects democracy.  Thousands of political prisoners and activists could be released if the opposition prevails."

The Malaysian ministry has announced that the stranded workers have been hired successfully by a new company that has offered to pay their salaries according to the minimum wage, reports Free Malaysia Today.  ""The human resources minister will give details of their employment soon,"" the source told FMT.  Yesterday, the workers gathered at the Bangladeshi High Commission due to the growing frustration over their woes, says FMT.  Abraham, a spokesman for the workers, revealed that they had not been given jobs upon their arrival in February or paid any allowance in the last four months.  ""They came here and their accommodation is not appropriate. Some of the places they were asked to stay at do not have proper sanitation and facilities. Their situation is very bad.  ""Besides this, they have no jobs, no money, and no food to survive,"" he told FMT.  According to Abraham, as many as 600 Bangladeshi migrant workers came into the country through four companies believing they would get jobs as housekeepers in Genting Highlands.  The Malaysian labour department released a statement saying it would sanction firms and withdraw licences from recruitment agencies involved in hiring migrant workers who found themselves stranded without jobs after arrival. They would also act against recruitment companies that misused government quotas and licences for hiring migrant workers.  Investigation involving companies related to the matter has already begun and the findings will be announced soon."

This is despite council claims that a water leak is “entirely unrelated” to the extra traffic.  Southern Water chief operating officer Bob Collington wrote to Brighton MP Caroline Lucas saying that heavy vehicles “may have played a part” in a mains failure which has blocked Upper North Street for repairs.  However, Brighton and Hove City Council has repeatedly denied that the extra bus traffic caused the damage despite similar leaks popping up on other diversion routes.  In the letter to Ms Lucas, Mr Collington said: “The additional traffic or weight of vehicles coupled with the failing road surface may have played a part in the mains fitting failure, however, this would be difficult to confirm.”  He said Southern Water had worked with the council to agree a longer closure to the road, which The Argus understands has been extended to June 9.  MOST READ:  Repair works on the road were originally scheduled to be done by May 5 but remain unfinished.  The letter also said that between 2019 and 2023 only one leak had previously been reported on the road.  A concerned member of the public said: “Days and days go by with no trucks or workers and there is garbage in some of the holes.  “This has been very disruptive. It’s still a big problem but often there’s no one there.”  Previously, the council said the original water leak had “nothing to do with the recent use of the road as a bus diversion” during the improvement works in Western Road.  The council doubled down on the remarks after a similar leak was spotted on a new diversion route in Montpelier Road, saying the leaks were “entirely unrelated” to the buses.  Services heading eastbound in Western Road are currently being diverted along Montpelier Road and through Seven Dials before returning to their normal routes at Churchill Square.  Brighton and Hove City Council was approached for comment in response to the letter."

Argentina World Cup winner Emiliano Martinez is all set to visit Kolkata in his tour of India in July. It is expected to be a two-day tour from July 4-5. The Aston Villa no.1 remains a major favourite in the city after starring for the Albieceleste at the Qatar World Cup and playing a pivotal role over their win.  Martinez is currently playing for the Villans in the final stretch of their Premier League campaign. Villa are pushing to secure qualification for a European competition next year and the Argentine goalkeeper is focused on ensuring that happens.  Emiliano Martinez to visit Mohun Bagan Club in July  Kolkata giants Mohun Bagan have confirmed that Martinez has promised to visit their club on July 4, as part of his Kolkata tour. The Mariners have managed to secure an agreement with the World Cup-winning goalkeeper to pay them a visit when he arrives at the City of Joy.  In an official statement, Mohun Bagan General Secretary Debashis Dutta confirmed that Martinez will visit the club tent in Maidan, Kolkata on the evening of the 4th of July. Further details of the programme in which the Argentine will be celebrated is going to be revealed in due course.  Martinez will join group of legends who have visited the Mohun Bagan Ground during their tour of Kolkata in the past. The likes of Pele and Diego Maradona both visited the tent in the past and the Mariners have managed another major coup in the World Cup-winning goalkeeper. It is said that Emi will kick his autographed footballs into the gallery as well.  Where else will Martinez visit?  In his promotional visit to India, Martinez will spend two days in Kolkata in July. He will also meet West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee as well as former India cricket team captain Sourav Ganguly during his visit.  He’ll also be a chief guest for a charity match that will take place at the Mohun Bagan Ground during his visit. Moreover, Martinez will also visit some other heritage sights in Kolkata. He’ll travel to Santosh Mitra Square, which has earned its fame for hosting one of the city’s biggest Durja Puja festivities.  Also, he’ll visit Sreebhumi Sporting Club, where a Diego Maradona statue is located at. He could even visit some other famous places in the city, but that is yet to be confirmed.  Martinez was the Golden Glove winner in the 2022 Qatar World Cup, having kept three clean sheets. He also starred in the penalty shootout win against the Netherlands in the quarter-finals, before playing a massive role in the penalty shootout win over France in the final to help Argentina earn their third World Cup."

Photo / Otago Daily Times  The biggest local council drama of the year has come to a surprising end with Gore District Council mayor Ben Bell surviving a vote of no-confidence raised by his councillors.  In fact, in Tuesday’s extraordinary meeting of council, none of the councillors at the table even voted to advance the motion to hold a vote - despite seven of the district’s 10 councillors last week asking Bell to resign.  It was a sudden end to a drama that dates back to last year’s local elections, where tensions between the newly-elected Bell and his chief executive Stephen Parry reportedly started to fray shortly after Bell’s narrow election victory.  Speaking to On the Tiles - Local Edition host Georgina Campbell, NZ Herald reporter Kurt Bayer said that the “extraordinary extraordinary meeting” had a packed public gallery, more media in attendance than usual, and protesters out front in support of Bell, all waiting for the motion to advance to the vote of no confidence.  “When it came to the big motion, there was silence. Nobody wanted to move the motion, and it died a death right there. That resulted in some big cheers from the public gallery and applause, and a pretty relieved-looking Mayor Bell.”  Bayer said that the move wasn’t a total surprise, as the motion was sold as being a symbolic move to try and change the situation and ease the tensions around the council table.  The intense national attention on the council and the town likely led to a change of heart as well.  “The attention was plainly unwarranted by the town. Yesterday and in the days leading up to it, they’ve talked a lot about ‘the Gore Way’. It’s a pretty conservative farming region, mainland types, so they just want to crack on with things and not be in the national headlights where this is played out. It goes against all of that.  “I would say it’s definitely played into things, whether it made them back down from a coup. I think there was a lot of pressure behind the scenes to sort it out.”  One motion to write to Local Government New Zealand and seek support was supported unanimously, but Bayer said that despite the no-confidence motion failing, there are still big questions about what will change with the central frayed relationship.  “One key figure in all of this, the CEO Parry, wasn’t at Tuesday’s meeting,” Bayer said. “That’s the real key one, I think. Parry, who’s been there 20-plus years running that council, he had a six-term mayor, Tracy Hicks, who he had been working with. And then he got this young out-of-towner, 24-year-old, coming in.  “So they have admitted themselves to a very strained relationship, so how they can work together will remain to be seen.”  Listen to the full episode for more about the Gore District Council drama.

Mohammed Ali, 39, woke to “panicked screams” from his girls, aged seven and 12, as robbers burst through his front door with machetes, a meat cleaver and a brick. The HGV driver first saw two of the intruders on the stairs of his semi-detached four-bed home as another held a knife against his daughters’ throats in their living room. And when his son emerged from his upstairs bedroom seconds later, one of the men chilling yelled “Kill him! Kill him!” before advancing towards the 18-year-old. Mohammed said he pushed the lad back into his bedroom and ran to a bathroom, where they took refuge while the robbers hacked at the doors with their machetes. After five minutes, the brutes finally fled the property and stole his white Seat Leon car from his driveway when they found his keys. Mohammed, who didn’t know why his home was targeted, said he had been left “broken” by the incident - adding he felt like he’d “failed” his family. He said: “My daughter said one of them had a knife and he was saying, ‘It’s all your dad’s fault, be f*cking quiet,’ and was putting a knife to her neck. “They all had gloves and everything, but you could see their eyes through the balaclava – and their voice, I could never forget it. “I’ve not slept since. My family is broken. My kids wouldn’t come home. “It was my daughter’s birthday yesterday, and literally everything is spoiled and I don’t know what to do or what to say to them. I feel like I’ve failed them.” Mohammed said he'd gone to bed at 9.30 pm on May 9, leaving his youngest son, who is five, and two daughters watching the TV at their home in Oldham, Grtr. Manchester. His make-up artist wife Michelle Dunkley, 40, had forgotten her keys when she left the house for work in the evening so he’d unlocked the door before heading upstairs. But at 11 pm, he heard one of his daughters utter a high-pitched scream before finding two masked men on the stairs holding metre-long machetes. He said: “It wasn’t a scream where the kids were fighting. This was a panicked scream, a worried scream. I knew as a parent this was not normal. “As I was trying to get down the stairs, I was faced by three guys in balaclavas. Two were on the stairs, one at the bottom, and one had my kids downstairs. “I started screaming: “Get out! Get out!”. They started swearing at me. My son had the room next to the stairs, and when he came out, they said: “Kill him! kill him!” “I pushed him into his room and closed the door, and they started coming up the stairs. I went to the bathroom, which was right behind me. “I was just screaming: “Make sure they don’t get to you!” “They started hacking at the doors with the machetes, and while they were hacking it, the third guy was ransacking my house.” Mohammed said he spent a terrifying five minutes holding the door shut, hoping the men wouldn’t break through. And when he finally realised they had made their way down the stairs, he heard the rev of his car engine and realised they were trying to steal his car. He added: “I was still half asleep. I was dazed and in a panic and I didn’t know if they’d got my son or my other kids downstairs. “Once my car started and they were driving off, I gave chase then went inside and saw my kids were alright.” Mohammed said his children were thankfully unharmed despite their trauma, and besides his vehicle, the men only took a box of his daughter's miniature dolls. But after he shared footage of the robbery on social media, he said another family in nearby Rochdale reported the same gang had attacked them just an hour later. The disturbed dad said he had reported the attack to Greater Manchester Police but didn’t think they were taking the incident seriously. He said: “It’s absolutely disgraceful. I left it with the police. But it’s like they’re not bothered. “They will only take action when someone is seriously hurt or dead but I don’t want that on my conscious.” Greater Manchester Police have been approached for comment."

The country of almost 85 million people holds the unfortunate record of the longest process to join the bloc: 36 years – and counting. No other candidate state in Eastern Europe or the Western Balkans comes even close to matching Turkey's protracted path to EU membership.  In fact, since Turkey submitted its official application on 14 April 1987 to be part of what was then the European Economic Community (EEC), 16 countries have seen their bids green-lighted, making Ankara's omission even more glaring.  After a continued succession of ups and downs, promises and threats, it has become apparent that Turkey's accession is a unique case of policy-making that Brussels has not quite learned how to manage.  From Atatürk to Hallstein  To understand Turkey's EU ambitions, we must go all the way back to the days of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the revolutionary leader who resisted the country's partition in the aftermath of World War I and forced the victorious Allies to negotiate favourable terms under the Treaty of Lausanne.  This paved the way for the proclamation of the Republic of Turkey on 29 October 1923 as a one-party parliamentary system with a president, Atatürk himself, as head of state.  Atatürk then launched an intense and rapid series of reforms to build a modern, Westernised country: in the span of a decade, the newly-formed republic saw the abolition of the Caliphate, the introduction of a Latin-script alphabet, a raft of European-inspired laws, drastic changes in dressing codes and the enactment of secularism in the constitution.  The radical transformation paid off. In 1949, Turkey was among the first countries to join the Council of Europe, the Strasbourg-based human rights organisation. In 1952, it became a member of NATO, the transatlantic military alliance created in direct opposition to the Soviet Union.  Story continues  By then, Ankara had set its sights on the nascent project of European integration in Western Europe. In 1959, the country applied to become an associate member of the European Economic Community (EEC), a request granted four years later.  ""Turkey is part of Europe,"" declared Walter Hallstein, the president of the EEC Commission, while celebrating the signature of the association agreement in September 1963.  ""It is an event without parallel in the history of the influence exerted by European culture and politics. I would even say that we sense in it a certain kinship with the most modern of European developments: the unification of Europe.""  But a first major roadblock was erected in the summer of 1974 when Turkish troops invaded the northern part of Cyprus in response to a coup d'état sponsored by the Greek military junta. The conflict split the island in two, a division that still looms large over Turkey's European dreams.  A long-awaited declaration  Nevertheless, the association agreement provided Ankara with a solid foundation to gradually move forward.  In 1987, Turkey formally submitted its application to join the EEC, then made up of 12 members, including Greece. At the time, Turkey's GDP per capita was $1,700 – a far cry from the over $16,000 in both Germany and France.  The huge economic gap, coupled with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the reunification of Germany and persistently poor relations with Cyprus and Greece, slowed down Ankara's bid.  During this time, Turkey was expected to carry out additional reforms to meet the so-called Copenhagen criteria, the fundamental rules that determine a country's eligibility to join the EU. The criteria, laid down in 1993, impose high standards on democracy, the rule of law, human rights, the protection of minorities and an open market economy.  Mustafa Kemal Atatürk (pictured centre) is considered the founding father of the Republic of Turkey. - AP/AP1932  In the meantime, Brussels offered Ankara an intermediate step in the form of a customs union for the trade of goods other than agriculture, coal and steel, which became fully operational in early 1996.  It wasn't until December 1999 when EU leaders, during a European Council in Helsinki, unanimously declared Turkey a candidate country, opening the door for Ankara to join their ranks on an equal footing.  ""Turkey is a candidate State destined to join the Union on the basis of the same criteria as applied to the other candidate States,"" the leaders wrote in their joint conclusions.  The declaration was not merely rhetorical: it gave Turkey access to millions of EU funds in pre-accession assistance.  The absorption capacity  The 2004 enlargement saw the EU move decisively Eastwards and welcome a total of 10 new members, many of which had been subject to the iron fist of the Soviet Union.  For Ankara, it was an awkward affair: the country had submitted its bid well before any of the newcomers, including Cyprus, and was still waiting for the accession process to kick off.  In 2005, the Council finally adopted the framework for negotiations, a nine-page document peppered with references to the rule of law, the EU's ""absorption capacity,"" the importance of ""good neighbourly relations"" and the possible suspension of talks.  ""The shared objective of the negotiations is accession. These negotiations are an open-ended process, the outcome of which cannot be guaranteed beforehand,"" the document says.  ""If Turkey is not in a position to assume in full all the obligations of membership, it must be ensured that Turkey is fully anchored in the European structures through the strongest possible bond.""  The framework served as the main guidelines for the European Commission, which was tasked with steering the negotiations. The talks are split into 35 chapters, a highly complex undertaking that is meant to perfectly align the candidate with all EU rules.  The chapter on science and research was the first one to be opened in 2006 and was provisionally concluded that very same year. In the decade that followed, Turkey, under the leadership of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, managed to open an additional 15 chapters.  But none were closed.  Total standstill  The 2000s marked a period of impressive economic growth for Turkey: its GDP per capita more than tripled, from $3,100 in 2001 to $10,615 in 2010, while services rapidly expanded thanks to sectors such as transport, tourism and finance, deepening the country's modernisation.  Still, the evolution was not enough to overcome tensions in the Mediterranean and the growing reticence among EU leaders, some of whom began suggesting a full-time membership could be replaced by a ""privileged partnership"" – a big no for Ankara.  ""Between accession and (special) partnership, which Turkey says it does not accept, there is a path of equilibrium that we can find,"" French President Nicolas Sarkozy said in 2011. ""The best way of getting out of what risks being a deadlock is to find a compromise.""  In response to cautionary words coming from Paris, Berlin and Vienna, Erdoğan raised the stakes and said he expected accession to be completed by 2023 to coincide with the republic's 100th anniversary. The migration crisis of 2015-2016 gave Turkey political leverage as the country standing between the bloc and millions of Syrian and Afghan refugees.  But things went sour after the July 2016 coup d'état attempt, a critical episode that led Erdoğan to strengthen his grip on power and consolidate what critics decried as a one-man rule.  In November of that year, Members of the European Parliament approved a resolution blasting the ""disproportionate repressive measures"" introduced under the state of emergency and calling for a ""temporary freeze"" on accession talks.  Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel had a complex relation with Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. - FRITZ REISS/2006 AP  The 2017 referendum to install a unitary presidential system granting the head of state vast executive powers further undermined Ankara's application and fuelled criticism from EU officials and lawmakers, with some even questioning if Turkey could still be considered an eligible candidate according to the Copenhagen criteria.  The fast deterioration culminated in June 2018 when member states put negotiations on hold.  ""The Council notes that Turkey has been moving further away from the European Union,"" said the conclusions from a meeting in June 2018. ""Turkey's accession negotiations have therefore effectively come to a standstill and no further chapters can be considered for opening or closing.""  Since then, progress has been almost non-existent.  Freed from the expectation of having to meet EU standards, Erdoğan has ramped up his denunciations against the West, ordered controversial drilling operations in the Eastern Mediterranean and maintained active ties with Vladimir Putin despite Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.  Ties with Brussels have gone so awry that Turkey, which technically speaking is still a candidate country, is now suspected of helping Russia evade EU sanctions.  The 2022 enlargement report released by the European Commission offered a sombre assessment of where things stand now.  ""The Turkish government has not reversed the negative trend in relation to reform, despite its repeated commitment to EU accession,"" the report reads. ""The EU's serious concerns on the continued deterioration of democracy, the rule of law, fundamental rights and the independence of the judiciary have not been addressed."""

Within a year he was working as translator to elected Socialist President Salvador Allende. In September 1973, 50 years ago, the Chilean military and police, backed by the CIA, conspired to overthrow Allende and establish a brutal military dictatorship that lasted 17 years. Thousands were killed and tortured; tens of thousands were exiled.  The following, excerpted with permission from Cooper’s book “Pinochet and Me: A Chilean Anti-Memoir,” courtesy of Verso Books, details how Cooper was caught in the sweeping violence of the coup, how he survived it and how he escaped Chile eight days later. Truthdig will host a livestream event with Marc Cooper and Suzi Weissman on Wed. May 17 at noon (PDT) — click here for more information.  7 a.m., Tuesday September 11 1973  The fledgling Santiago sun and the transparent sky, the fresh spring chill in the air and the blossoming jacaranda made that Chilean morning glorious. As I stood in the yard of my friend Melvin’s suburban house in Santiago and glanced at the lingering snowcaps on the Andes towering right behind me, as I sucked the fragrant, misty air into my lungs, I resolved I would, from that moment forward, make a sea change in my life. Quit smoking, cut back on drinking, get to bed before 3 a.m. and start rising earlier so as to enjoy more frequently these morning wonders.  I had gotten up early because my Chilean residency visa expired that day and I needed to renew it. For a year now I had been working as a translator to Salvador Allende, and in this capacity I was scheduled to travel with him the next week.  I knew that presidential translator status would afford me little advantage in navigating Santiago’s byzantine bureaucracy. Renewing my visa would still take the entire morning. And getting an Argentine visa so I could travel with Allende to Buenos Aires for the inauguration of the new Argentine president would take the rest of the day. An early start was imperative.  Taxis had become harder to come by as many of the cab companies had joined the work stoppage led by the Truckers’ Association — a group floated with CIA dollars. Retail merchants, doctors, lawyers and almost everyone more elevated than manual workers and farmers had joined the stoppage. In daily entreaties, they pleaded with the armed forces to do away with the popularly-elected President Allende and restore Chile to Business-As-Usual.  Indeed, Chile had already pitched itself into a dizzying dance of chaos and blood. As Allende’s reforms deepened, as he nationalized the American copper mines and the telephone company, as large rural estates were handed over to their sharecroppers, as wages soared and unions gained a voice in national affairs, as rents were lowered and taxes on the rich increased, the political Right and eventually the Center jettisoned their attachment to the rule of law. Opposition groups fielded chain-swinging thugs. Oil pipelines were dynamited. Industrial production was sabotaged. The wealthy hoarded food and other consumer goods and then complained loudly about the resulting shortages.  Just a week previous to this morning, on September 4, the Chilean Left held its last great public gathering to commemorate the third anniversary of Allende’s election. While the president stood granite-faced on a balcony from early afternoon till late at night, more than half a million Chilean workers marched before him, voicing the nearly unanimous chant: “We want guns! We want guns!” It was a horrible, wrenching moment, one permanently seared in my consciousness. Yes, guns. But what guns? From where? My friends and I walked home that evening with a dark foreboding. The end was surely near.  President Allende and General Pinochet, seen together before the coup. Photo by AFP  In the seven days that followed, the Right drew the noose tighter. Commerce and transport ground to a halt. The night before September 11, the transport stoppage had waylaid me and my girlfriend at Melvin’s house. We had gone out as a foursome, wound up snacking at Melvin’s, and got stranded without a way back to my downtown apartment.  My only chance of transportation that morning came from my friends at RadioTaxi 33. Militant revolutionaries, the drivers there had long ago seized the company from its conservative owners and had turned the place into the most efficient cab service in Santiago. And when the drivers weren’t working their shifts, they would volunteer as drivers and messengers for the most powerful workers’ council in Santiago, the Cordon Vicuña McKenna.  After a 45 minute wait on the corner, I became concerned. I went back to the house to call the cab company again but, inexplicably, the phone lines were now permanently busy. I walked back to the corner and eventually was able to flag down a passing cab.  The driver, pale and harried, rolled down the window. “Can you take me downtown?” I asked.  “Downtown?”  “Yeah, to the immigration office,” I answered.  With a classic Chilean understatement, the cabbie replied: “But, sir, there are problems downtown.”  “Problems?”  “Yes, problems,” he said, refusing to be more specific. After all, these were highly polarized times. You never knew who you were talking to. One person’s problem was another person’s liberation. But a sinking feeling in my gut told me the worst was upon us.  Mustering my own diplomatic skills, I asked: “Problems, you say? Problems with men in uniform, you mean?”  “Yes, sir, problems with men in uniform,” the cabbie said. But now, the fear of the future already imprinted on him, he took what he probably knew would be his last foray into freedom for some time and added: “Yes, the fucking fascists are overthrowing the government.”  7:55 a.m., Tuesday September 11  Everyone else in the house was still asleep. I switched on the massive Grundig radio and waited impatiently for the tubes to heat up. As the audio came alive I turned the dial and confirmed the cabbie’s report: virtually every station was playing the same military march.  I stopped the dial on Radio Corporación, the station of the Socialist party. Allende was speaking, a nervous inflection in his voice. His words made material the nightmares that had haunted us for months: “This is the president of the republic speaking from La Moneda Palace. Confirmed reports indicate that a sector of the navy has isolated and occupied the port city of Valparaiso, which means an uprising against the government is under way…Under these circumstances, I call upon the workers of the country to occupy your workplaces…but I urge you to stay calm…At the moment there have been on extraordinary troop movements in the capital…I am here defending the government that represents the will of the people…”  On just about every other radio station a stern-voiced announcer suddenly materialized. By order of the military junta, he said, all stations were immediately to link up to the armed forces network or “they will be bombarded.” The names of the four commanders making up the junta were then read: leading the national police — the carabineros — was a general, César Mendoza, a little-known name; for the air force, Gustavo Leigh; for the navy, Admiral José Merino. But the most important name on the list was Army General Augusto Pinochet. Pinochet, previously Commander of the Central Garrison, had two weeks earlier taken over as Commander-in-Chief, swearing his loyalty to the president he was now trying to overthrow.  Some more Prussian marches. And then another announcement. An ultimatum to Allende. I sat chilled and shaking as I strained to scribble down the text of what a steely voice called Military Communiqué Number 2: “The Moneda Palace must be evacuated before 11 a.m. otherwise it will be attacked by the Chilean air force. The workers must remain in their workplaces and homes as it is strictly prohibited to leave them. If they disobey, they will also be attacked by air and ground forces.”  I sat paralyzed. A few moments later the same dry baritone voice read out Communique Number 3. Again I noted it on a yellow pad. “The population is hereby warned not to let themselves be carried away by incitements to violence from either foreign or national activists. And let the foreign ones know that in this country we do not accept violent attitudes or extreme positions. This should be remembered, as means are adopted for their rapid deportation from the country. Any resistance will be met with the full rigor of military justice.”  Yet another announcement proclaimed a curfew “until further notice.” Anyone found on the streets “will be shot on sight.” I had roused the others in the house. We sat dumbfounded in the chilly living room listening to Radio Magallanes, the Communist party station, boldly resisting the order to broadcast the armed forces network. Over the air, workers were being urged to report to their factories and organize defense committees.  But we knew this was an empty gesture. Those of us who worked in the Allende government knew the sad truth: that in spite of the right-wing chorus that Allende had formed a “parallel army,” no such units existed. Allende had been scrupulous in his commitment to the constitutional, legal and peaceful transition to socialism. The only guns in the country, he vowed, would remain in the hands of the armed forces. Yes, some Socialists and others had formed clandestine militias — but they were operationally risible.  This war was going to be a short, one-sided massacre. And the tragic irony was that those conservative and centrist political forces that for 150 years had defended a constitutional system as long as it served their interests were now rebelling against it. The last man standing in defense of the “bourgeois” constitution would be the Marxist President, AK-47 in hand.  10 a.m., Tuesday September 11  Miraculously, my first attempt to phone the office where I worked in the Moneda Palace went through. Over the sound of crackling gun fire, a secretary, Ximena, told me in tears that she and the others were about to flee the building. My next call was to the U.S. Embassy — up on the 14th floor of an office building diagonally opposite the Moneda. I had had virtually no contact with the embassy and had, in fact, made every effort to steer clear of it. Even my mail was routed to the Canadian Embassy — a government that had shown more sympathy to Allende.  This war was going to be a short, one-sided massacre. And the tragic irony was that those conservative and centrist political forces that for 150 years had defended a constitutional system as long as it served their interests were now rebelling against it.  But I phoned the U.S. Embassy that morning hoping that some safety provisions were being made for resident Americans. I figured it was only a matter of hours before I would be swept up in the military dragnet.  The embassy phone answered on the first ring. An accented English told me that I was speaking with a Chilean employee — always more American than the Americans. When I asked if the embassy had issued any special instructions, my respondent only laughed: “No special orders. Just stay off the streets.” And then with another chuckle she added: “I’m looking out the window now with binoculars. Looks like Mr Allende is finally going to get it.” She hung up.  11 a.m., Tuesday September 11    The leftist Radio Corporación and Radio Portales are off the air. But Salvador Allende’s metallic voice is coming live over Radio Magallanes. Via telephone, from inside the Moneda, with troops and tanks poised outside, with the Air Force Hawker-Hunter jets arming their rockets in readiness, Allende spoke:  This is surely the last opportunity I will have to address you. The air force has bombed the towers of Radio Portales and Corporación. My words are not bitter but they are full of disillusionment. And they will serve as moral sanction for those who have betrayed their oath of loyalty: the soldiers of Chile, the branch commanders…Admiral Merino who has named himself Chief of the Navy. Mr. Mendoza, a slinking general who only yesterday swore his loyalty to the government, has proclaimed himself head of the police… In the face of these events I can only say this to the workers. I will not resign… With my life I will pay for defending the principles dear to our nation… History cannot be stopped by repression or violence… Surely Radio Magallanes will be silenced and with it my voice. But that’s of no importance. You will continue hearing me as I will always be by your side… At least you will remember me as a man with dignity, a man who was always loyal to you. You must know that, sooner rather than later, the grand avenues on which a free people walk will be open and a better society will be at hand… These are my last words…  I sat stunned and devastated. I can only remember the four of us listening and sobbing for I don’t know how long. The fear was palpable. To go into the streets was to risk arrest and execution. We had no access to any information except what the military broadcast over the radio. The phone lines were now dead.  Everything I learned over the previous two years told me that the Chilean Revolution was now dead.  4 p.m., Tuesday September 11  A non-stop cascade of military communiques: that the Moneda had been bombed, that the Allende government was no longer, that all political activity was banned, that a dawn-to-dusk curfew was in effect, that the citizenry should denounce all “suspicious foreigners.” As that first evening enveloped us I felt as if I were already in prison.  I knew I was a prime target: Allende’s translator, an activist in the radical wing of the Socialist party and a foreigner to boot at a moment when all foreigners were ipso facto suspect. I thought of my apartment and cringed, a downtown high-rise located directly across the street — no more than 20 yards — from the new junta headquarters. Régis Debray, the French writer and radical who had spent time with Che Guevara in Bolivia, had lived in my building when Allende first came to power. Other units were rented to exiled guerrillas from Argentina and Uruguay. The building teemed with the international New Left. One room of my apartment was stocked with the cheap editions of political classics and classic fiction made available under Allende. On my studio desk were copies of the work I had translated for Allende. In my top drawer was my passport, a visa to Cuba where I was scheduled to visit with Allende, and to top it all off, a .22 revolver with a couple of boxes of ammunition. On the floor were two radio transceivers that I was repairing for my buddies at Radio Taxi 33. In short, once the troops broke into my apartment, as they undoubtedly would, a warrant would be issued for a 22-year-old American named Marc Cooper.  Tuesday night to Thursday night, September 11 to 13  Those days were passed in the sort of blur produced by a state of deep shock. All that remains now is a kaleidoscope provided with a semblance of meaning by scraps of hurried, sometimes incoherent notes. I know I didn’t sleep that first night. I imagined Allende riddled and bloodied on his office floor. I could see the Moneda reduced to rubble by rockets and fire. The following morning, an official communique announced that Allende had committed suicide.  I knew I was a prime target: Allende’s translator, an activist in the radical wing of the Socialist party and a foreigner to boot at a moment when all foreigners were ipso facto suspect.  The resumption of Chilean TV. A wavering, black-and-white image — now in the annals of history’s infamy — of General Pinochet sitting ramrod straight in the presidential chair, his arms crossed over his chest, Ray-Ban Wayfarers hiding his dulled eyes, his accomplices in the junta standing beside him.  I thought of the poor neighborhoods and factories, now surrounded by vengeful troops. I wondered about my friends: about Vincente and an American named Vince; Ximena, Jorge, Orlando; about the journalists, the coworkers. How many were already dead? How many would I ever see again? How long would it be before the troops came crashing through Melvin’s door to take me away?  I thought of the celebrations no doubt taking place that night in the lush suburbs of Providencia and Las Condes. I listened to the radio and noted down the congratulatory notes pouring in to Pinochet from the Doctors’ Association, the Lawyers’ Guild, the Chamber of Commerce, the Truckers — all the business sectors that had paved the way for the coup.  On Wednesday a statement from the supreme court chief justice, Enrique Urrutia, affirming the court’s “pleasure” with the military takeover. A terse military statement suspending habeas corpus and announcing a declared state of siege. Military communique number 29 dated September 13: “On this date the government junta has decreed the following: the closure of the National Congress and the vacancy of all its parliamentary seats. Signed, the governing junta of the armed forces and carabineros of Chile.”  People lie on the ground after being arrested by the military during the coup against the government of President Salvador Allende in Santiago, Chile. (AP Photo, File)  I winced at what I knew would be the wave of bloodletting, homicide and torture that was about to wash over Chile. I wondered how the hell I was going to get out alive.  I remember getting up at four in the morning and shaving off my beard. I remember opening my wallet and taking out my union card, my Socialist party membership, my ID from the Moneda and setting them ablaze. Those two days after the coup, Wednesday and Thursday, were marked by the sort of looming madness that I imagine accompanies solitary confinement. We had little food in the house. Melvin — a 30-year-old Bronx-born American — had never told me why he was in Chile. I had always assumed he was ducking a drug possession charge coming out of the ’60s. A fervent Allende supporter, and a fervent anticapitalist, he made his living buying and selling on the black market.  The only food in the house was a freezer full of Eskimo pies, several sacks of onions and a case of Pisco liquor. This odd diet, peppered with fear and haunted by uncertainty, drove me into a feverish, swirling retreat. I could barely talk to my Chilean girlfriend — now my wife — Patricia. I slept, I paced, ate ice cream, read Jim Thompson novels, cried and waited either for the curfew to lift or the door to come crashing down. But mostly we sat and listened to the radio. List after list of the wanted: Allende’s cabinet ministers, party activists, union leaders, prominent and not so prominent exiles had their names read over the air and were ordered to surrender at the Ministry of Defense. How they were expected to step out on the curfew-swept streets without being shot was not explained. As every announcement began, I was sure my name would be next.  10am, Friday September 14  Melvin and his girlfriend have drunk themselves into a stupor. As the radio announces that the curfew will be lifted today for five hours, Patricia and I decide we must leave Melvin’s. She had to check on her family. I had to get my passport out of my apartment and figure a way to safety. Two weeks before the coup my former roommate Carlos Luna, an exiled Argentinian guerilla fighter, had shown up at my apartment with a 9mm automatic. “The shit is coming,” he said, pulling the pistol from his jacket. “When it does, I am getting into the Swedish embassy even if I have to shoot my way in.” But I had no such formidable weapon nor such courage. The military had already announced it had put rings of troops around European embassies. I wondered where Carlos was. Was he dead by now?  My impulse to flight was heightened when, during the break in curfew, a client of Melvin’s, a deli owner, came to the house in his 3-cylinder Citroneta. Well-connected to the military, I took his words at face value when he told me matter of factly, “Cooper, you’re fucked. Your apartment has been raided and they’re out looking for you,” I asked him to drive me some­where safe. He refused.  A numbing panic gripped me. For the next four hours I could move, but I had nowhere to go. My apartment had been trashed, I was told, my passport seized, my name was on a wanted list, and the streets were full of soldiers and check­points. The phone started working again. In what must have been the moment of greatest naivety in my adult life, I thought again of the U.S. Embassy. I had an image in my head from Rossellini’s Rome: open City. I could see the grainy black-and-­white footage of Embassy staff cars rushing around the battle-littered streets, their white flags flapping.  I am embarrassed now, years later, to confess that I thought that, given the mounting bloodshed in Chile, the American Embassy on that day would be sending out rescue cars to pick up beleaguered stragglers like myself. I was under no illusions as to where the Embassy was at politically. The Nixon-Kissinger regime had made clear its intention to do away with Allende and it was now three days deep into implementing that goal. But I was deluded enough to think that, in order to avoid the uncomfortable spectacle of American citizens being killed by its new client military dictatorship, the U.S. government might do something to protect us. In this I was entirely wrong.  As the curfew temporarily lifted that Friday I called the U.S. Consulate. Explaining merely that I was an “American student,” that I had done nothing wrong, but that the Chilean Police had raided my apartment and seized my passport, I told the Vice-Consul, Mrs. Tipton, that I needed help. Even as I asked, my heart began to sink. Her husband was the Embassy’s top “polit­ical officer,” tied to the darkest aspects of U.S. policy.  The Nixon-Kissinger regime had made clear its intention to do away with Allende and it was now three days deep into implementing that goal.  “Do you have a U.S. driver’s license?” Mrs. Tipton asked me. “Yes.”  “Good,” the Vice-Consul said. “Don’t bother to come in today because we’re about to close. But come in on Monday. Bring your license and $10 and we ‘II expedite you a new passport. Should take about a week, maybe 10 days.”  Stupefied, I argued with her. But to no avail. No special instructions to U.S. citizens were being offered. “Just stay away from shooting and obey the new authorities,” she said. As far as the Embassy was concerned, my predicament was a simple case of a lost passport.  They certainly knew better. But the political calculation had already been made. It was more important to give political sup­port to the new dictatorship than it was to undermine its credibility by suggesting that American citizens needed protec­tion against it.  Noon, Friday September 14  Turned away by the Embassy, I was now desperate. I rummaged through my mental Rolodex and focused on a long shot. An American friend of mine, an Allendista, had told me some months before that a guy named Dennis Allred, who served as the U.S. Embassy’s Student Affairs Counselor, was a decent man, a closet Allende sympathizer who took secret delight in handing out U.S. scholarships to the most radical of Chilean students. True or not it seemed like the only chance I had.  I phoned the Embassy back. No, I was told, Mr. Allred wasn’t in. But, yes, being a fellow American, I could have his home phone number. “Dennis, you don’t know me,” I told him after he answered his phone. “But I’m an American and I’m in trou­ble. I need … “  “OK,” he said, cutting me short. “I don’t care about the details. If you need a place to stay you’re welcome here. Come now. I’m at Merced 280.”  I thanked him and hung up. Merced 280? That would put him right next door to the heavily guarded U.S. Consulate. Could I get past the troops? Patricia and I hurriedly made a plan. She would catch a bus to her parents’ home but first would swing by my apartment and check its condition. She would call me later at Allred’s. I would walk the seven miles to Allred’s house as I had no ID and buses were being boarded and checked by soldiers.  My clothes were filthy. Melvin, who is 6′ 2″, lent me a pair of pants. I am 5′ 3″. I tucked the bottom of the pants up and pinned them inside with safety pins. He gave me a fresh shirt and I rolled the sleeves up over my wrists. On top of this unlikely outfit I wore my black leather jacket. For three hours I trudged toward Allred’s house, protected only by sunglasses, taking side streets and looking far ahead for any checkpoints.  By 4 o’clock I was on the perimeter of the U.S. Consulate. Neighboring Forestal Park was literally an armed camp. Armored carriers bristled with machine guns and helmeted troops. In front of the Consulate, a few steps from Dennis Allred’s apartment, a company of soldiers lounged on a tank. I could hear my heart beating in my ears. I had no idea what I would tell the soldiers if challenged. I walked straight ahead, my eyes fixed on the door of Allred’s building, my pace steady. Like passing through a time warp, I floated into the building uninterrupted.  A big, red-headed Bostoner, Allred greeted me alone in his luxury apartment. I was so pent up I could hardly talk at first. And then I began to talk too much. “I don’t need to hear the details of your story. You can stay here as long as you have to,”” he said. He then offered me a tumbler full of Old Grandad which I gulped down like water. The booze took the edge off, and I slumped back in the broad padded mahogany chair. I called Patricia at her parents’ house. I was relieved to hear that my apartment had not been raided. She had got in, picked up my passport and a couple hundred dollars, and tossed my .22 and the two boxes of ammo down a garbage chute. She would come and visit me the next day when the curfew was again to be lifted for a short time.  Over a real meal that evening — salad and Kraft macaroni and cheese — Allred told me the news, good and bad. “This apartment theoretically has diplomatic immunity, theoretically Chilean security cannot enter,” he said. “On the other hand, the morning of the coup, the U.S. Embassy took my passport, locked it in a safe, sent me home, and told me they’d call me when I should come back to work. So I don’t know how much protection we really have.” I could only guess that the stories my friend had told me about Allred were true.  She had got in, picked up my passport and a couple hundred dollars, and tossed my .22 and the two boxes of ammo down a garbage chute.  That night, on the convertible bed in his den, the saddest of Portuguese fadas I had fished out of Allred’s record collection drowned the sounds of sporadic gunfire and the rumble of tanks outside my window. With a strong sleeping pill Denis gave me I slept soundly for the first time in almost 100 hours.  6 p.m., Sunday September 16    The word was apparently out on Allred’s generosity. Over the weekend the apartment filled up with other hunted prey. A few had been beaten and bruised by troops who had broken down their doors. Others, like me, had nowhere to go. Still others were there because I had contacted them. Allred had taken the courageous step of abandoning his direct-dial diplomatic phone to us — a luxury in a country where long-distance calls even under optimum circumstances were difficult to make and where now so-called “press-calls” of the sort we were making had to be cleared by a military censor. With Allred’s phone we skipped over those obstacles.  In Allred’s study we set up a mini information clearing house. We called around the city to check on the safety of over­lapping networks of friends and co-workers. Once the information was compiled from a mongrel mix of sources — friends, friendly reporters, diplomats, health workers, UN func­tionaries — we were able to skirt Chilean censorship and pass the information directly on to family, media and human rights groups in the U.S. Painstakingly, we cobbled together lists of those safe, those arrested, and those simply missing. But there was still no way out of Chile. The airports were closed, the embassies sealed. Any foreigner on the street was ipso facto a sus­pect. Who knew who was on the myriad wanted, arrest and kill-on-sight lists? We already knew the U.S. Embassy was useless.  A friend of mine, a Mexican reporter, called me from his Embassy. Would I be interested in getting on a list that the Mexican Embassy was putting together to be evacuated? “Absolutely,” I answered. I gave him the names of three or four other desperate friends. He told me to sit tight and wait, that word of the flight out could come at any time. I had no choice but to comply.  A few friends who had come to see me at Allred’s told tales of serious resistance, of a regrouping of Allende forces, of guns that were on their way, of former Army General Carlos Prats, forced from office a few weeks before the coup, who was now pulling together a People’s Army. The rumors all sounded wonderful. And we knew they were all false. The Chilean armed forces, the CIA, Nixon, Kissinger, the Chilean business elite had won their victory early that first morning when the Army didn’t divide and when Allende perished inside the Moneda. Now they were just mopping up the rest of us.  Noon, Monday September 17  Word had come that some Americans were missing. David Hathaway had been taken from his apartment. Frank Teruggi was unaccounted for. Sometime that day, our friend Charlie Horman would be seized.  During my time in Chile I had only limited contact with the American expatriate radical community. Some of them had come together in a group called Fuente de Informaci6n Norteamericana (FIN), which struggled to gain a voice as an alternative source of information on Chile to the mainstream media. I had no participation in that project but, for a short time shortly after I arrived in Santiago, I spent a string of Saturday mornings in a “study group” with Frank Teruggi and others. I soon tired of those meetings and what seemed to me at the time their uncritical attachment to the MIR. But I always thought fondly of the spry and witty Teruggi, who was clearly the brightest among his friends.  I had first met Charlie Horman only recently. One after­noon he showed up unannounced at my apartment door and introduced himself as a friend of some of my friends. That was sufficient basis for us, fueled by a couple of liters of rich Chilean red wine, to talk of politics and life deep into the night. We had a few other sporadic lunches and chats.  Now I can only regret that I did not spend more time with Charlie and Frank. I would next see them a decade later and then only as celluloid ghosts conjured up in the Costa-Gavras film “Missing.”  One young American professor rallied us in Allred’s living room and we went as a delegation next door to speak to the U.S. Consul. Enough was enough, we shouted. We wanted the U.S. Embassy to do everything it could to find those who had been arrested. And we wanted protection for ourselves. We wanted the Americans to do what every other diplomatic delegation was doing in Chile — protecting its own citizens from a rampag­ing, barbarous military. The Consul, Frank Purdy, stood in the hall, blocking access to his office. He spouted the party line: he would look into these matters but there was nothing else to be done that day. The State Department had still issued no specific instructions for Americans in Chile. No special protection was to be extended.  “I recommend you be careful,”” Consul Purdy said. And then he looked us in the eye and came up with a straight-out lie. “The armed forces are restoring order but there’s still a danger of scattered left-wing snipers. Be careful.” With that he shooed us out of the Consulate. In retrospect we made mistakes. Our disgust with our government kept us from making what should have been the next logical move. We should have sat down and occupied the Consulate.  That afternoon, shortly after we slumped back from the meeting with the Consul, the whole apartment shook with a thud. Then another bone-chilling thud. Walking out onto Allred’s second-floor balcony we saw the two tanks that were doing the shelling. Comfortably squatting in the park, they lobbed artillery rounds into the Fine Arts Campus of the University of Chile across the river. That’s how the armed forces of Chile were restoring order.  8 p.m., Tuesday September 18  One week since the coup, and the call came through from the Mexicans. Thanks to the Mexican government I was to be on a flight organized by the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees for the next morning. Apart from a special military aircraft that carried Allende’s widow to Mexico, this would be the first flight allowed out of Chile. There was a catch, of course. I had to be at the distant Sheraton Hotel the next morn­ing at 7:30 sharp. But curfew didn’t lift till 7. It was going to be tight. Nor could I get word to Patricia to meet me to say good­bye. She used a neighbor’s phone and if I called her now, at night, it would be too dangerous to defy the curfew. I’d have to wait till morning to call. This was another low point. The mix of emotion I felt was paralyzing. I was ecstatic at the thought I might get out the next day, but terrified that something might go wrong. I was also deeply depressed, laden with survivor’s guilt: my only prospect for joy was to flee the slaughterhouse of my friends.  7 a.m., Wednesday September 19  The moment the curfew lifted, I called Patricia and asked her to do what she could to meet me at the Sheraton. I hugged Allred goodbye. With only my passport, $200 in cash and the borrowed clothes on my back, I walked past the encampment of soldiers outside Allred’s door. On the corner, a daring taxi driver was ready for the post-curfew fares. When we got to the Sheraton, I began to reach into my pocket to pay him. The cabbie turned around and commenced one of those skilfully coded dialogues.  “Are you a foreigner?” he asked.  “Yes, an American.”  “Have you been living in Chile?” he asked, noting my local accent.  “Yes, for nearly three years.”  “Are you leaving today?”  “Yes. I am leaving.”  “Then,” the cabbie said, “there will be no charge. I want your thoughts about your last moments in Chile to be positive ones.”  Operating on an emotional hair-trigger, I couldn’t answer through my tears. I only nodded.  Inside the Sheraton lobby I was met by UN and Mexican officials. There was to be a motley mix of about 50 of us on this flight. Few of us knew each other. There were some Spanish clergy. Some Mexican teachers. An American researcher black and blue from a beating. A Texas high-school swim team that had had the bad luck to be passing through Santiago on the wrong day. Because Americans were on the flight manifest, American consular officials were there with clipboards in hand. We refused to talk to them.  The mix of emotion I felt was paralyzing. I was ecstatic at the thought I might get out the next day, but terrified that something might go wrong. I was also deeply depressed, laden with survivor’s guilt: my only prospect for joy was to flee the slaughterhouse of my friends.  Just before I boarded the bus to the airport Patricia arrived for a short goodbye — she would arrange to meet me later in the U.S. Under heavily armed military escort we were taken to the Cerrillos military airport. After bureaucratic stalling by the junta’s new immigration officers, who challenged the validity of our UN-secured safe-conduct pass, we were herded onto a cor­porate 737 owned by LADECO, one of the copper companies nationalized by Allende.  There was an eerie silence as we took off. No one was sure of anyone else on the flight. As we gained altitude, the plane banked around and began to cross the majestic, snow-sparkled Andes en route to Buenos Aires. Twenty minutes into the flight a crackling voice came over the intercom. “Ladies and gentle­men,” the captain announced crisply, “we have just entered Argentine air space.”  The entire plane exploded into yelps of joy and applause. Soon we were all on our feet embracing each other, even the Texas swim team. The Kool-Aid and baloney sandwiches that were served remain to this day the best airplane meal I’ve ever had.  We were greeted in Buenos Aires as heroes even by the immigration police. And that night we marched with 100,000 Argentines to protest the Chilean military dictatorship.  The following week Patricia called me to tell me that on September 22 she went by my apartment and found the front door blown off its hinges, the entire residence sacked by sol­diers.  Two months afterwards she came to the U.S. and we have been married ever since. Dennis Allred resigned from the U.S. Foreign Service. Ten years later when I passed through Sweden I found my old guerrilla roommate Carlos Luna running an import-export business with Cuba.  In his final speech on Magallanes Radio, Salvador Allende promised us that one day there would be a “moral punishment” for the crime and treason that killed him and his Chile. We are still waiting.  Of Salvador Allende, his sacrifice and legacy, Gabriel Garcia Marquez lamented: “His greatest virtue was following through, but fate could only grant him that rare and tragic greatness of dying in armed defense of the whole moth-eaten paraphernalia of an execrable system which he proposed abolishing without a shot.”  Extracted from “Pinochet and Me: A Chilean Anti-Memoir” by Marc Cooper, published by Verso Books.  Author’s note: Diplomat Dennis Allred left the foreign service after the coup in Chile. He moved to Chicago and later to Brazil. He died in 1990 at age 45 from alcohol-related diseases."

The party at a meeting with some of its candidates in the last general elections, said that a legal team had offered to render services to candidates who felt cheated following the outcome of the Feb. 25 and March 18 general elections in the state.  The Lagos State LP Chairperson, Pastor Dayo Ekong, disclosed this while addressing the frontline candidates and other critical stakeholders at the party’s Secretariat in Ikeja on Tuesday evening in Lagos.  “We have a group of professionals and lawyers who want to volunteer their services for free to help our candidates retrieve their stolen mandates.  “Feel free to contact them in case you need legal advice. We are hopeful that legal practitioners will help those who do not have money to hire lawyers to fight their cases in court.  “All eyes are on the judiciary. We are going to win,” Ekong said.  The chairperson expressed optimism that the party would recover allegedly stolen mandates.  “This is the time for us to stand strong, tall and stay focused no matter the attacks and intimidation.  “We are with you. We want to feel more of you, we want you to support us and together we can move this party forward,” she said  Ekong assured that the state exco would continue to stand behind all candidates challenging the outcome of the last general elections.  According to her, the leadership challenges rocking the party will fizzle out very soon, as the party has commenced processes to expose and show the infiltrators the way out.  “We cannot allow people who are playing the script of some paymasters in our midst to continue. Our children must grow up to see a new Nigeria and that is our passion and commitment.  “Be part of the history, fight the battle no matter the castigation and intimidation. If our country is better, our children will sing a new song,” she added.  According to her, the chapter is solidly behind the Julius Abure-led National Working Committee and would not be part of any back-door coup against the party leadership for any monetary gain.  Urging the candidates not to be distracted but to be focused, Ekong assured them that the truth would prevail at the end of the tunnel.  She urged all the candidates to be closer to the party hierarchy in the state.  “We are at a period in this party when everything looks uncertain because of infiltrations,” she said.  She begged all aggrieved candidates to shelve their grievances and work to promote the party and its ideas in their various constituencies.  Corroborating the chairperson, the LP Secretary in the state, Chief Sam Okpala, said that some people had become ‘comrades in crimes’ to destroy the party and its structure in the state because of selfish gains.  “We need your support to stand and face the shenanigans who are hell-bent to destroy the party. They are out to play the spoiler’s role but God will continue to expose them.  “The party is standing strongly with you in the efforts to reclaim these mandates. We want you to help defend the interests and cause of this party in your various constituencies.  “We have almost 20 lawyers working together with some other professionals working together on this,” Okpala said.  Stating that the Lagos State LP chapter remained the bedrock of the party, Okpala described the interaction as a confidence-building meeting to clear airs on myriads of false narratives making the round about the party.  Commenting, the candidates and leaders of the party unanimously agreed to work with the party and Ekong-led state executive committee of the party.  The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the meeting had in attendance some House of Assembly, House of Representatives and Senatorial District candidates of the party in the last general elections with other stakeholders in the state.

Brian Cox pointed out to me that there’s a lot of Henry IV parts one and two in there, given the way Logan distrusts the focus of the generation below him (Kendall’s obsession with looking cool makes him a good analog to Prince Hal). In Shiv and Tom you can probably read into some sort of Macbeth dynamic (who is Lady Macbeth? Depends on the episode) and Greg is, of course, a great Fool, kept around in the court for wasabi-based jests and japes. But as the series heads toward its endgame, watching Sunday night’s election episode, the finale of another big Shakespeare tragedy kept coming to mind: Hamlet.  There’s some resemblance in the plot of that play to what’s currently transpiring with the GoJo deal — squint hard and Kendall’s equivocations about whether to commit to throwing his support behind Mencken and stopping the deal with Mattson are a bit like Hamlet trying to decide whether to kill his usurper uncle. But what’s really interesting is how Hamlet ends, which might provide a glimpse into how Succession unravels. After almost everyone in Elsinore kills each other, the militant prince of Norway, Fortinbras, arrives and claims the castle for himself. Hamlet, right before he dies, lends his support to Fortinbras, saying, “He has my dying voice” (it’s right before the whole “the rest is silence” bit), and Fortinbras then delivers the customary return-to-order speech at the end of the play, announcing that he’s going to give Hamlet a soldier’s burial with “the rites of war.”  It’s an ironic end for Hamlet, considering his whole problem is that he’s bad at taking action, but it tracks with the fact that Hamlet’s had a bit of a crush on Fortinbras from a distance (not unlike Roman Roy and Jeryd Mencken) for the whole play. He’s obsessed with the fact that the Norwegian prince is spending his time marching armies into Poland while he waffles about whether to kill his uncle or not — never mind the fact that Hamlet’s dad (named Hamlet) killed Fortinbras’s dad (also called Fortinbras). If you’re directing Hamlet, you can take that dynamic in all sorts of directions, casting Fortinbras’s crowning at the end as rightful or a coup. Robert Icke’s production at the Armory last summer had recorded cable-TV footage of Fortinbras, played by Starstruck’s Nikesh Patel, leading an invasion. In this way, Hamlet’s dithering leads to his kingdom, already in dire straights, being subsumed by fascism.  That brings us back to our pals in the court of the Roy family. At the end of Sunday night’s Succession, we have Jeryd Mencken — call him “far-right-inbras” — giving his speech on TV about purifying America while Shiv, Roy, and Kendall are at each other’s throats about the fate of Waystar, which is already floundering. Kendall, Succession’s most melancholy prince, goes along with the idea that Mencken is the one to support, simply because he convinces himself it will be possible to do business with him — not unlike going, “Hey, well, at least this guy is also a Scandinavian prince.” Extrapolating forward into the last two episodes, it seems quite plausible that, instead of any one of the Roy children ending up in charge of the company, the three of them destroy each other and then hand over the actual power to outside invaders.  Speaking of which, we should acknowledge the actual six-foot-four-inch Scandinavian prince in the room: Lukas Mattson, who is also watching things from the sidelines, an old (sort of) foe of the Roys’ father. Really, we should have seen a Fortinbras-style ending coming with a character like him from the moment everyone started talking about how their media empire was losing the battle to tech back in season one. Mattson’s numbers in India are probably fake, but in terms of deportment, he’s everything the Roy children are not: decisive, canny, an actual killer. As much as Kendall and Roman think they might be able to use Mencken to stop the GoJo acquisition, or even reverse the flow and swallow the tech giant back (good luck with that), if we’re looking to Hamlet as a model, all the internal conflict between the family will just make it easier, in the end, for Mattson to sweep in and take control without expending much blood of his own (except for the bricks he’s already FedExed to Ebba). Maybe he’ll even be nice and give a little speech about how noble and soldierly the Roy children were right at the end of the show. If that happens, tallying up the numbers, Succession will end up having two Fortinbrases, three Hamlets, and one Yorick (Karl)."

External analysis of Turkish politics often tends to focus on the divide between political Islamism and secularism, between liberals and conservatives.  But looking at Turkish politics today, there is one ideology that is represented across the board: nationalism.  Nationalists, in the form of the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) and its leader Devlet Bahceli, are the main allies of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.  Former MHP members who split with the party over its support for Erdogan went on to form the Iyi Party in 2017, now a key part of the opposition alliance.  Another ex-MHP member, Sinan Ogan, has been labelled as the “kingmaker” ahead of the presidential run-off scheduled for May 28 after he surprisingly won more than 5 percent in the first round of presidential elections on Sunday.  And then there are nationalists of a different flavour – left-wing Kurdish nationalists of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP), who fought the election under the banner of the Yesil Sol Party.  Even before Ogan’s emergence, the presence of Turkish nationalists at the centre of the two main alliances that fought the elections has allowed the ideology to have a greater effect on both sides of the debate.  It has led to a harder push from both sides to resolve the issue of approximately 3.7 million Syrian refugees living in Turkey — with both Erdogan and his opponent in the presidential run-off, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, tacking to the right on the issue in the past year.  A combination of anti-refugee sentiment and economic hardships has even led to pressure on politicians to send Syrians back to their home country, despite the ongoing rule there of President Bashar al-Assad, and even a spike in violence towards people perceived to be Syrian.  Turkish nationalists have also been able to seize on those same economic problems to foment xenophobic attitudes towards other refugee and migrant populations, and anti-Arab attitudes are also on the rise, both on the left and the right.  Ogan himself has already referenced “terrorism” as a red line for his support in the second round – a clear reference to Kurdish groups. While Erdogan’s AK Party included politicians from the predominantly Kurdish Huda-Par Islamist party in its parliamentary candidate lists, this will be more of a problem for Kilicdaroglu, who received a huge amount of support from HDP voters and will struggle to win over Ogan voters without losing Kurdish support.      Islamic movement replaced by nationalism?  Turkish nationalism has always been present in the post-Ottoman Republic of Turkey but really gained its own distinct path after the emergence of former army colonel Alparslan Turkes in the 1960s.  Turkes founded the MHP, which, along with its paramilitary organisation, the Grey Wolves, fought leftist groups in the 1970s. The Grey Wolves has gone on to be designated a “terrorist” group in Kazakhstan and banned in France, with calls for a “terrorist” designation to also be applied in the wider European Union and the United States. The Turkish government has denied the group’s existence.  While the MHP has moderated under Bahceli, it is still considered to be a hardline nationalist movement, the presence of which has pushed the Turkish government further to the right.  This was not always the case – the MHP opposed Erdogan’s peace process with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) in the early 2010s.  But from 2015 onwards, once the peace process broke down, and particularly after the failed coup against Erdogan in 2016, the MHP became a firm ally.  In that sense, the MHP replaced the group that has largely been blamed for the coup, the Gulenists – who were once Erdogan’s close partners.  Bahceli has replaced figures like former president Abdullah Gul and former prime minister Ahmet Davutoglu, men who were pivotal in Erdogan’s rise but who eventually split with him.  Davutoglu himself was famous for his “zero problems with neighbours” foreign policy. The Arab Spring, and a desire to support groups with a background in political Islam, such as Ennahdha in Tunisia and the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, ended that.  But the growth in power of the nationalist narrative also contributed to Turkey entrenching itself militarily fighting the PKK and its affiliates in Syria and Iraq, while a desire to project Turkish power has also seen disputes emerge outside of the Middle East, most notably in the eastern Mediterranean.  It all means that while Erdogan’s roots in political Islam can never be discounted and continue to be attractive to domestic conservatives, Turkish nationalism is arguably the stronger ideology within the Turkish government and will continue to be going forward.      What comes next?  Erdogan is now expected to win the run-off against Kilicdaroglu on May 28, having defied the expectations of the pollsters to emerge within a percentage point of winning the presidential election in the first round outright.  But the Turkish leader, who has led the country for 20 years, will turn 70 next year and will be 74 at the time of the next presidential election in 2028. Thoughts will surely be turning to who his successor will be.  It is a big problem for the AK Party, which appears rudderless without Erdogan. While his popularity has generally held steady, the party’s has dipped, shedding voters to nationalist parties.  Within the party, no one has Erdogan’s gravitas or popularity.  Some analysts predict that this means that the path will open for a member of the Republican People’s Party (CHP), perhaps someone like Istanbul’s mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, and that Erdogan’s successor will come from the left.  But it is Turkish nationalism that is on the ascendancy, in both the government and opposition camps, which makes it more likely that successor will emerge from the right."

Six Opposition parties came together to seize the momentum and fielded a joint candidate, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, a mild-mannered former bureaucrat who promised to arrest Turkey’s “slide towards authoritarianism” and fix its economy. Most opinion polls predicted that Mr. Erdoğan was trailing Mr. Kılıçdaroğlu. Yet, in the preliminary results, Mr. Erdoğan won 49.5% of the votes in the presidential election, a tad lower than the threshold that would have avoided a run-off, against Mr. Kılıçdaroğlu’s 44.9%. The President’s nationalist-conservative coalition also took a comfortable majority in Parliament. Mr. Erdoğan was facing serious criticism, particularly about his mismanagement of the economy. Turkey’s lira has lost some 60% of its value against the dollar in just two years. Foreign investors are fleeing and the current account deficit is ballooning. Annual inflation has hit the middle-class. After a devastating earthquake in February, the government’s response to the calamity and its building permit rules were slammed. Yet, the Opposition failed to turn these challenges Mr. Erdoğan faced into votes.  Mr. Erdoğan, whose Islamist Justice and Development Party (AKP) came to power in 2003, has remained a towering figure in Turkey’s politics. He rewrote its Constitution, turning its parliamentary system into an executive presidency, and got himself elected as the first President under the new Constitution. He used the failed 2016 coup to purge his rivals and tame the generals. He moved Turkey away from the western orbit and began building stronger ties with Russia and Arab countries, while retaining its NATO membership. His promise was to turn Turkey, once the core of the Ottoman Empire, into a major global power again. He presented himself as an outsider who revolted against the Kemalist establishment, and built a new order rooted in Islamist conservatism, public welfare and an Ottoman imperial nostalgia. Sunday’s election results show that this revivalist brand of politics still remains powerful. But that is not the whole story. The results also suggest that there are cracks in his base. In 2018, he won the presidential election in the first round with a 22-percentage point lead over his closest rival. This time, he was not just forced to go into a run-off, but the gap is just five points. Public resentment towards his policies was particularly high in and around Ankara and Istanbul. A directionless Opposition finally seems united and potent. Mr. Erdoğan may still be in the lead, but he has been humbled by Turkey’s voters."

Enter Daw Khine Zaw, chief executive officer of the Earth Group Companies. She is a sister-in-law of arch-crony and major arms dealer U Tay Za, the chairman of the Htoo Group of Companies.  Daw Khine Zaw has been involved in military-linked businesses since the days of former military dictator Than Shwe. She also has ties with current junta chief Min Aung Hlaing and his relatives.  According to The Irrawaddy’s business sources, it was Daw Khine Zaw who sold Min Aung Hlaing on the idea of promoting the use of EVs, including electric buses, in Myanmar. She has already been engaged in the renewable energy business, including solar power, for several years.  One Yangon car dealer told The Irrawaddy: “Daw Khine Zaw’s Prime Company alone is handling EVs. She has connections and she has won most of the licenses related to EVs.”  Prime Automotive Myanmar, a subsidiary of Daw Khine Zaw’s Earth Renewable Energy, is licensed to import EVs, while Earth Renewable Energy is licensed to build charging stations for them.  Under the now ousted National League for Democracy government, Daw Khine Zaw rarely appeared at the meetings of the Union of Myanmar Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry (UMFCCI). But since 2022, she has appeared at UMFCCI and is mainly engaged in solar power and EVs, added the car dealer.  While there is still no necessary infrastructure and facilities for EVs, the military regime formed a national-level committee on EVs and related businesses in June 2022, and took immediate steps to import electric cars and build charging stations.  The junta has also waived the tax on the import of EVs and parts for charging stations for the 2022-23 fiscal year. There are also reports that the tax will be exempted until the end of the 2024-25 fiscal year. Daw Khine Zaw’s companies are enjoying tax exemptions, too, according to automobile dealers.  This March, Earth Renewable Energy opened Myanmar’s first charging station for electric buses on the Yangon-Naypyitaw-Mandalay Highway in Naypyitaw’s Dekkhinathiri Township. So far it has built three charging stations along the highway, according to the company.  Traditionally, foreign automakers distribute their cars through authorized dealers in Myanmar. Prime Automotive Myanmar Co has, however, attempted to import vehicles directly from foreign companies, resulting in disputes with local dealers.  The Yangon car dealer said: “They reached out to foreign car companies and asked them to sell branded vehicles, saying they have the permits [to import].”  Who is Daw Khine Zaw?  Daw Khine Zaw is the sister of Daw Thida Zaw, the wife of arch-crony U Tay Za. The 60-year-old businesswoman engages in around five industries including manufacturing, transportation, and renewable energy.  She won the Association of Southeast Asian Nations 2019 Women Entrepreneur of the Year award. She is also a vice chair of the Myanmar Industries Association, which is a sister association of the UMFCCI.  Over the past decade Daw Khine Zaw has portrayed herself as a female entrepreneur to boost her image among international business owners, despite her ties to the former and current military regime. She is also close to people who move in political circles in Thailand.  Daw Khine Zaw has previously won licenses for construction projects in the Myanmar capital Naypyitaw that were backed by former generals. The most notable tender was to construct solar-powered lighting along the Yangon-Naypyitaw-Mandalay highway. The tender was worth billions of kyats, but the lighting failed within a few years because it was of poor quality.  She is also a laywoman of Sitagu Sayadaw, a military-linked Buddhist monk who is close to Min Aung Hlaing. The monk served as the vice-chair of ultranationalist Buddhist group The Association for Protection of Race and Religion, better known by the Burmese acronym Ma Ba Tha.  The group has become known for racial and religious hate speeches since it was established in 2013, some two years after Min Aung Hlaing succeeded Than Shwe as Myanmar military chief."

Netanyahu is now trapped between his need and desire to kill Justice Minister Yariv Levin’s poisonous legal upheaval and his inability to publicly announce its demise. So meanwhile, he’s handing out money to the settlers and the ultra-Orthodox, who are raiding the public coffers even as average Israelis are being hammered by rising inflation.  'When Trump said F**K Bibi, it wasn't a slip of the tongue' Subscribe 0:00 -- : -- 15 Skip 15 seconds backwards Play audio 15 Skip 15 seconds ahead 1 X Change playback rate from 1 to 1 Mute audio  The story of the arnona (property tax) fund – a proposal to have wealthy towns allocate a portion of their property taxes to a fund that would benefit poorer communities – took over the battle between the blocs this week. But it also includes two political stories whose implications are greater than they seem.  The first is the divorce between Haim Bibas – mayor of Modi’in-Maccabim-Re’ut, chairman of the Federation of Local Authorities and someone the Likud party marked as potential leadership material some years ago – and Netanyahu’s Likud.  This isn’t the first time Bibas has dared to come out against Netanyahu from his position of power as local authorities leader. He criticized the prime minister during the coronavirus pandemic, he opposed giving homophobe Avi Maoz some of the Education Ministry’s powers, and he bravely spoke out against the government’s destructive efforts to enact its legal coup. But his battle against the arnona fund seems likely to be the straw that breaks the camel’s back.  The fault line emerged when Bibas and his fellow big-city mayors discovered that Likud MKs who had supported their position in the Knesset Finance Committee were nevertheless obliged to vote for the bill – because the prime minister was enforcing coalition discipline. People close to Bibas say that contrary to the Finance Ministry’s claims, Bibas never agreed to any compromise on this issue. That’s because he views the fund as harming big-city residents by nationalizing their money, and the “negotiations” as having been forced on the cities by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Knesset Finance Committee chairman Moshe Gafni.  We lost Bibas  “Bibas is no longer with us,” one Likud minister said. “We realized this during the story of the [legal] reform, and now it’s already public. This isn’t just a fight with Netanyahu; the biggest heartbreak is his rift with Yariv Levin. They were brothers, cornerstones of the Likud branch in Modi’in. But today, when you’re against Netanyahu and Levin, Likud is scorched earth for you.”  People close to Bibas also realize that Netanyahu is likely to oust him from his position as chairman of Likud’s municipalities committee – a group with a strong foothold among the grassroots that will be of great importance in the upcoming municipal elections.  During the crisis over the arnona fund, Bibas’ associates said, many attempts to silence him were made, but he is willing to pay any political price, including “being burned with the [Likud] base,” to defend the interests of the city residents he represents.  Yet it’s not at all clear that Bibas will be the big loser in this story. Several centrist parties will likely propose that he run on their ticket in the municipal elections – Benny Gantz’s National Unity Party, Yair Lapid’s Yesh Atid, Naftali Bennett’s expected new party and who knows what others may arise. Some of the above are already courting him.  Open gallery view Modi'in Mayor Haim Bibas. Credit: Jorge Novominsky  But the prevailing political wisdom is that he won’t enter national politics as long as Netanyahu is around. “Bibas is the archetype of what Likud should be – Mizrahi, born in Beit She’an, right-wing, social-welfare-oriented and liberal,” one prominent rightist said. “For Likud to sacrifice him, an act that looks like caving in to Gafni and Smotrich, is a mistake.”  The second story, which was bolstered by the arnona fund, is the ultra-Orthodox community’s blindness about its situation and insistence on making itself hated, to the point that its exclusion from the next governing coalition will become genuinely essential.  The arnona fund wasn’t created solely to benefit the Haredim, but it will benefit most of their towns, at the expense of the wealthiest cities. Coming on top of the scandalous coalition funding (money earmarked for the pet projects of coalition parties and MKs), and given that Gafni, of United Torah Judaism party, was a key player in creating the fund, the proposal looks like another aggressive, avaricious act by the ultra-Orthodox.

Credit: Olivier Fitoussi  “There are no greater extorters than the Haredim. They are never satisfied, they always ask for more and more until you tell them ‘enough,’ and even that isn’t enough. They are taking this situation to the extreme, and they will also pay the price.”  Those comments didn’t come from a center-left politician like Lapid or Labor MK Gilad Kariv, but from a Likud minister. In short, the ultra-Orthodox have managed to annoy everybody except themselves."

Starting in November 2010, the Doha Talks was a process of intermittent negotiations between the United States and the Afghan Taliban. The culmination of this process was the Doha Agreement, signed in February 2020. The agreement facilitated the withdrawal of US and NATO troops from Afghanistan.  The Geneva talks  However, about three decades earlier, the US government had also played a pivotal role in another peace process on Afghanistan — Geneva Talks. The outcome of the latter talks was the Geneva Accords which facilitated the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan in February 1989.  The Geneva Talks took place in the background of a military occupation of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union. In late December 1979, tens of thousands of Soviet troops invaded Afghanistan to prop up a client regime in Kabul. The regime — also known as the Afghan Communist regime — had been established a year earlier following a military coup in April 1978. Ever since its establishment the Communist regime faced an armed resistance from anti-Communist resistance fighters — Mujahideen. At the time, the United States along with neighboring Pakistan supported the Mujahideen.  The Soviet Union claimed that it had deployed its forces in Afghanistan at the request of the Afghan government to fend off the threat from the Mujahideen. The United States refuted the Soviet claim. According to American President Jimmy Carter, the Soviet Union had occupied Afghanistan as part of an expansionist policy to acquire warmwater ports on the Indian Ocean — which implied further expansion into neighboring Pakistan. Hence, the United States claimed that the rationale behind its support for the Afghan Mujahideen was to stop the claimed Soviet expansion into the Persian Gulf.  Indirect negotiations for six years  Brokered by the United Nations, the Geneva Talks was a series of twelve rounds of indirect negotiations that ran for six years starting from June 1982 to April 1988. The talks nominally took place between the governments of Afghanistan and Pakistan, but the key actors behind the scenes were the Soviet Union and the United States. The outcome of this process was the Geneva Accords which was a set of four interrelated agreements signed on 14 April 1988 by the foreign ministers of Afghanistan and Pakistan and by the US Secretary of State and the Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union as the international guarantors.  At the heart of the Geneva talks was an effort by the United Nations to help the parties find a negotiated solution for the withdrawal of the Soviet troops from Afghanistan. The Soviet Union and the Afghan Communist regime reasoned that the Soviet troops would leave Afghanistan once the threat from the Mujahideen was removed. To remove the threat from the Mujahideen, they demanded the United States and Pakistan to halt their support for the Mujahideen first and then the Soviet forces would withdraw. However, the United States and Pakistan contended that the Mujahideen was not the cause but the consequence of the Soviet involvement in Afghanistan and therefore the Soviet troops must withdraw without any preconditions.  Seeking regime change  The removal of the Communist regime … was one of the main objectives behind the US involvement in the Afghan conflict.  In addition to the issue of the Soviet troops, there was another issue at stake which was not overtly part of the negotiations in Geneva but important to both the Soviet Union and the United States. Besides a withdrawal of the Soviet troops, the United States and Pakistan sought a regime change in Kabul. The removal of the Communist regime in Kabul was one of the main objectives behind the US involvement in the Afghan conflict. For that reason the US government, under Jimmy Carter, had supplied covert financial assistance to the Mujahideen about six months prior to the Soviet invasion. However, for the Soviet Union the survival of the regime in Kabul was of paramount importance because according to the Soviet leader, Leonid Brezhnev, the primary reason for the presence of Soviet troops in Afghanistan was to prevent the fall of the regime.  Withdrawal and noninterference  Hence, the two main issues in the Geneva Talks were withdrawal of the Soviet troops and noninterference. Noninterference referred to a cessation of the US and Pakistan’s support for the Afghan Mujahideen. By implication it also meant that the United States and Pakistan would not pursue a regime change in Kabul.  Differences over who would rule Afghanistan after a withdrawal of the Soviet forces withheld progress in the Geneva Talks for several years. In June 1985, following the ascension of Mikhail Gorbachev as the leader of the Soviet Union, the US and Soviet governments launched bilateral negotiations over regional issues, including Afghanistan.  [Gorbachev] was determined to withdraw from Afghanistan — calling it a bleeding wound for the Soviet Union.  The new Soviet leader was determined to withdraw from Afghanistan — calling it a bleeding wound for the Soviet Union. However, the commencement of bilateral US-Soviet negotiations on Afghanistan meant that the Geneva Talks between Afghanistan and Pakistan was merely a proforma exercise. This meant that substantive negotiations took place between the governments of the United States and the Soviet Union, and their outcomes manifested in the Geneva format which was nominally taking place between the governments of Afghanistan and Pakistan.  In November 1985, Premier Gorbachev and President Reagan met in Geneva. Afghanistan was part of the agenda, and once again, a main point of contention between the two leaders was about the status of the Afghan government. Gorbachev proposed declaring Afghanistan a nonaligned state followed by a withdrawal of the Soviet troops. Reagan, however, demurred. He pointed out that the president of Afghanistan — Babrak Karmal — was a Soviet client and therefore implied that it was not feasible to establish Afghanistan’s nonalignment without a replacement of the Soviet-backed regime in Kabul.  The Soviet Union, however, aimed to preserve the regime in Kabul. In early 1987, the Afghan Communist regime launched a National Reconciliation Program. The program — funded by the Soviet Union — was designed, in addition to offering a share of power to Mujahideen leaders, to lure individual Mujahideen commanders to reconcile with the regime by offering them financial and economic incentives. In other words, the objective of the National Reconciliation Program was to integrate the Mujahideen within the existing political structure in Kabul. Nonetheless, the Mujahideen rejected the program, as they vowed to continue the fight until the destruction of the Communist regime. In Washington, President Reagan also dismissed the Soviet-funded reconciliation program as a “sham.”  Failed reconciliation and intensifying conflict  The failure of the National Reconciliation Program and an intensifying conflict in Afghanistan prompted the Soviet Union to shift its policy from seeking to preserve the Communist regime to preventing a government led by the Mujahideen. In early December 1987, Soviet officials informed their American counterparts that the Soviet Union had made a decision to withdraw from Afghanistan. They urged the Americans to consider mutual interests. A Mujahideen-led government, the Soviet officials said, would also complicate American interests in the region.  Around the same time, Gorbachev and Reagan held another meeting in Washington. On 9 and 10 December 1987, the two leaders discussed the issue of Afghanistan. Reflecting the change in the Soviet position, Gorbachev said that Afghanistan was not a socialist country but a “semi-feudal pluralistic” country. The Soviet Union, he added, was no more concerned about how the people of Afghanistan chose to live. He invited Reagan to “think together in a businesslike approach” to establish a neutral government in the context of a Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan.  The US position, however, was that a neutral government could not be established without the removal of the Soviet-backed regime in Kabul. Hence, Reagan proposed disbanding the military structures of the Afghan Communist regime in the context of a Soviet withdrawal. In other words, Reagan wanted to dismantle the ruling regime and then “start from scratch.”  Breaking the deadlock  Two months after the Washington Summit, Gorbachev announced on 9 February 1988 that the Soviet Union was ready to start the withdrawal of its troops from Afghanistan on 15 May 1988 and to complete it within ten months. He added that the withdrawal from Afghanistan was no more conditional on an agreement about the future government of Afghanistan. That, he said, is “none of our business.”  The unilateral announcement by Gorbachev broke the insistent deadlock in the Geneva Talks which had been taking place between the governments of Afghanistan and Pakistan but without substantial progress. However, two months after Gorbachev’s announcement, the Geneva Talks concluded in April 1988 with the signing of the Geneva Accords which, among other elements, set a nine-month timeframe for the withdrawal of the Soviet troops from Afghanistan.  Letting the conflict take its course  Following the withdrawal of the Soviet troops in February 1989, the two superpowers allowed the conflict between the Mujahideen and the Afghan Communist regime to take its course. The expression of this policy was best exemplified in a conversation between Gorbachev and the US Secretary of State, James Baker, in February 1990. Referring to the ongoing war in Afghanistan, Gorbachev said: “Let them boil in their own juices over there.” To which, Baker responded: “When you said, ‘Let them boil,’ I thought we have the same feeling.”  ***  Rahmat Hashemi is a Doctoral Researcher at PRIO."

Munir had to endure the former PM’s reciprocal indignity of supposed corruption charges  When the relatively unknown and perceptibly dour Gen. Syed Asim Munir took over as Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff from the barrel-chested and garrulous Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa on November 29, 2022, it seemed like a change of sensibilities and perhaps even narrative. Gen. Bajwa’s initial “selection” (2018 elections) and later “ejection” (2022 no-trust vote) of Imran Khan was completed. Gen. Bajwa hung up his boots while the vainglorious Imran was given the boot! But it wasn’t the end as Imran kept ranting, provoking and getting under the Pakistan Army’s skin. Beyond Gen. Bajwa and the current ISI chief (Lt. Gen. Nadeem Anjum), Imran called out the ISI number two (Maj. Gen. Faisal Naseer, “Dirty Harry”) to shame the “establishment”. It was a pressure test for Gen. Munir. Imran baited, Gen. Munir bit hard. Ultimately, no change of narrative resulted.  In hindsight, Gen. Munir was always the establishment’s “chosen one” — meaning of Gen. Bajwa. The reasons are clearer now. Gen. Munir had tellingly overcome the technicality of getting “selected” for COAS despite his then retirement date as a lieutenant-general falling on November 27, while Gen. Bajwa was to doff his uniform only by November 29, yet Gen. Munir defied the odds of required adjustment. The farce of Schedule V-A of Pakistan’s Rule of Business says: “The appointment of, and above the rank of, lieutenant-general in the Army and equivalent ranks in the other defence services will be made by the Prime Minister in consultation with the President”. The real McCoy for passing the COAS’ Malacca cane was singularly Gen. Bajwa, representing the establishment. Incidentally, the sitting Pakistan President, Arif-ur-Rehman Alvi, is a founder member of Imran’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaaf (PTI): he couldn’t possibly have been allowed to exercise his mandated choice, not in the circumstances then prevailing.  As a rare Shia COAS, Gen. Munir faces the onerous task of exhibiting his fidelity to the “establishment” and steely resolve to the nation, just as it drove the only two other Shia COAS — Gen. Muhammad Musa and Gen. Yahya Khan — to wars with India in 1965 and 1971. Gen. Munir carries the unsaid burden of proving himself in a deeply sectarian society. He was ISI D-G when the Pulwama attack took place on February 14, 2019. Not responding or succumbing to Imran’s accusations about Pakistan’s Army was not an option.  Lo and behold, on May 9, 2023, Imran was bumped into a personnel carrier of the Punjab Rangers and whisked away rather unceremoniously for a former Prime Minister. It was reminiscent of the arrests of Iskander Mirza in 1958 (Ayub Khan’s coup), Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto in 1978 (Zia-ul Haq’s coup) and Nawaz Sharif in 1999 (Pervez Musharraf’s coup). Gen. Munir moved against a man who seemed to be unsettling the Deep State even more than the ruling civilian government.  Gen. Munir earned his place at the top with the critical “one crescent, one star and three crowns” on his epaulettes (as a brigadier), directly under then X Corps commander Gen. Bajwa. Clearly not wet behind his ears in terms of societal posturing, Gen. Munir is a Hafiz-e-Quran (one who has memorised the complete Quran). Unlike many flamboyant colleagues, he served “under the radar” and seemed “safe” (as was ironically, and wrongly, assumed for Ayub Khan, Zia-ul Haq and Pervez Musahrraf). Well-versed with the intrigues of Pakistan, Gen. Munir is the only COAS to have worn the dual hats of director-general of military intelligence and also director-general of ISI.  With the shortest tenure as the ISI D-G, due to his unusual questioning of the corruption trail leading to the wife of then PM Imran Khan, Gen. Munir has his unhealed personal history with him. As Imran’s bête noire, Gen. Munir had to endure the former PM’s reciprocal indignity of supposed corruption charges, while posted as XXX Corps commander. However, as ISI D-G, he would have been wise enough to know the consequences of pointing fingers at the PM’s wife, so presumably he would have only been doing Gen. Bajwa’s bidding to send out a message to Imran to adhere to the establishment’s playbook. But Imran didn’t confine himself to the establishment’s red lines. While Gen. Munir was to be the sacrificial lamb in 2019, he romped home in 2022 as the dark horse who became the all-powerful COAS.  If ever there was any doubt about Gen. Munir as Gen. Bajwa’s acolyte, it was put to rest with his “taking stock” of the situation, as Pakistan’s generals tend to do historically, whenever they or their institution stand to get besmirched. Whether Imran Khan has tripped Gen. Munir into making him an ever-bigger hero in the public eye, or, has bitten more than he can chew, will depend on how the emotions get manufactured and controlled in the days and weeks to come. But the “establishment” has moved decisively, and committed itself to a point of no return — at least for the next two and a half years of Gen. Munir’s tenure. Imran stands to be politically neutralised (not physically, as he melodramatically claimed, as that would irreversibly turn the public tide against the Army).  So, brace yourself for sneaky leaks, sleazy exposés and corruption charges against “Taliban Khan” (as the world increasingly sees him), that will be gleefully and dutifully supported by the discredited ruling side and scared judiciary. Whenever the “establishment” decides to do something, they usually get it, legitimately or illegitimately. Gen. Munir has turned out to be a chip of the old block!"

But the Republican interpretation of the final Durham report will feed a narrative of “Deep State” corruption that is fueling not only Mr. Trump’s quest for the White House in 2024 but that of many of his rivals for the Republican nomination. The vilification of federal bureaucracy was already an emerging theme in the fight to be the Republican standard-bearer. Regardless of Mr. Durham’s actual conclusions, his report appears to serve that theme.  Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, Mr. Trump’s closest competitor in the still-early Republican primary race, promised on Monday “to clean house” at “weaponized federal agencies,” which he said had “manufactured a false conspiracy theory.”  “Heads need to roll,” another competitor, former Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina, said.  Mr. Trump had termed the Russia investigation “the crime of the century,” and with no one doing time for that crime, the Durham report could still prove to be Exhibit A in how the American right seems to be living in its own universe — and how Mr. Trump still dictates the parameters of that separate reality.  On his Truth Social website, Mr. Trump said the special prosecutor had concluded that “the FBI should never have launched the Trump-Russia Probe!” In fact, Mr. Durham said he agreed that the F.B.I. should have opened a preliminary investigation.  “I, and much more importantly, the American public have been victims of this long-running and treasonous charade started by the Democrats — started by Comey,” Mr. Trump told Fox News Digital. “There must be a heavy price to pay for putting our country through this.”"

But if the Welsh club want to stay in the EFL, or challenge for promotion from League Two, they will need to bring in some fresh faces this summer. Manager Phil Parkinson already boasts an impressive squad but knows there is always room for improvement.  Wrexham's Hollywood owners Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney want to sign Gareth Bale, but that is highly unlikely to happen. Yet there's a chance they will lure some more former internationals to the Racecourse after persuading Ben Foster out of retirement.  Image: Getty Images) Getty Images)  Foster's short-term deal with Wrexham will expire shortly, but the club are in talks with the former England goalkeeper, 40, over an extension. It will be difficult for Foster to say no after the joyous celebrations that followed Wrexham's title triumph.  One area of the team that Parkinson doesn't need to worry about too much is the defence. Wrexham boasted the third-best defence in the National League this season thanks to a solid back three, with Jordan Tunnicliffe, Ben Tozer, Eoghan O'Connell, Aaron Hayden and Thomas O'Connor all impressing at different times in the year.  O'Connell, 27, is likely to continue playing in defence having only signed from Charlton in January. Tunnicliffe, 29, Tozer, 33, Hayden, 26, and O'Connor, 24, also have EFL experience and will continue playing while Parkinson looks for long-term replacements.  Who do you think Wrexham should sign this summer? Let us know in the comments below!  At right-wing-back, Ryan Barnett, 23, was snapped up from Solihull Moors in February and will be confident of playing in League Two next season. On the opposite flank, Danny Rose could make a shock move to Wrexham to reignite his football career.  The Champions League finalist, 32, has expressed a desire to make a comeback but will want the right club after a year out of the game. Considering the bond between Reynolds, McElhenney and the club's employees, Wrexham could be the perfect fit.  The same could be said about Danny Drinkwater, who would be a huge coup for the Welsh club. The Premier League winner, 33, has also been without a club since last summer but recently admitted he was ""waiting for an offer to excite me"". You heard him, Wrexham.  Drinkwater could form a partnership with James Jones in midfield. The Scot, 27, has played 88 games for Wrexham during the last two years and has plenty of experience in the EFL, making more than 200 appearances in League One and League Two combined.  In terms of the No.10 role, Jonny Williams would be an ideal candidate. The Welshman, 29, helped his country reach the semi-finals of Euro 2016 and has played at every level in the Football League. His contract with Swindon will expire next month.  But who plays alongside Paul Mullin? The 28-year-old could be joined by his former strike partner Joe Ironside, 29, who has just been released. The pair scored 48 goals between them to fire Cambridge to promotion from League Two during the 2020/21 campaign."

Early this year, the regime halted insurance payouts for families of 66th Light Infantry Division (LID) soldiers killed in Kayah (Karenni) State whose bodies could not be recovered. They are listed as missing in action rather than dead, a source close to families of the 66th LID told The Irrawaddy.  “They are not listed as dead because [the Myanmar military] does not want to give insurance payouts,” he said.  The 66th LID is based in Inma town on the Yangon-Pyay Road some 20 miles to the south of Pyay in Bago Region, and overseen by the Southern Command.  Soldiers who have recently deserted say the bereaved families are not receiving the money owed to them for two reasons. Firstly, corrupt officers are pocketing the payments, and secondly the regime wants to impose news blackouts on the heavy military casualties it is suffering.  The payments were made for regime soldiers who died in clashes with the Arakan Army (AA) in Rakhine State between late 2018 and November 2020 even when their bodies could not be retrieved, said Hein Zaw Oo, a 19-year-old private who defected from the army in April.  “But lately, [the military] has not been sending death benefits and bank savings for soldiers whose bodies cannot be retrieved,” he said.  Hein Zaw Oo last served in Light Infantry Battalion 2 based in Kyaikto, Mon State. The battalion is under the command of 44th LID and is fighting the Karen National Union and People’s Defense Force in Karen State.  It is mandatory for junta soldiers to buy life insurance. Privates are required to buy a minimum two-year policy worth 500,000 kyats (US$ 238 at the official exchange rate) and pay a monthly premium of around 8,400 kyats.  Also compulsory for military personnel is saving money at the military-owned Myawaddy Bank, and buying shares in the military-owned Myanmar Economic Holdings Ltd.  Defector Ye Htet Kyaw, who served as a private in Light Infantry Battalion 341 based in Karen State’s Papun, said battalion commanders would siphon off the money when the dead soldiers had no relatives, or their relatives could not be contacted.  “My superior died after stepping on a land mine while carrying food supplies. He had around two million kyats in his bank account. The battalion commander took the money after his death and said it was deposited in battalion funds. I don’t buy it.”  An estimated 14,890 junta soldiers were killed, and nearly 5,000 wounded in the 12 months after armed revolution began on June 1, 2021, following the military coup in February that year.  CDM captain Htet Myat said: “Most military family members do not know how much military personnel have paid for insurance premiums. Only the soldiers themselves know. And insurance certificates are usually kept at battalion offices. And some family members don’t know about the insurance, in which case they do not get death benefits.”  As family members do not know the insurance amount paid, battalion commanders never give death benefits in full, said defector Ye Htet Kyaw.  “If there is three million kyats in the bank, family members only receive 1.5 million kyats” he said.  Former captain Htet Myat said officers have been siphoning off life insurance payouts since before the coup, listing soldiers killed at front line as missing in action. But the exploitation has worsened since the coup, he added.  Previously, Myanmar military personnel had been required to buy life insurance at state-owned company Myanma Insurance. But since 2015, four years after Min Aung Hlaing became the military chief, military personnel have been required to take out insurance with Aung Myint Moh Min Insurance Co, which is owned by Min Aung Hlaing’s son, Aung Pyae Sone."

When Mohi el-deen Jibril checked his phone on May 11, he saw his name on a list of people accused of betraying the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and supporting the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). Instantly, he thought of leaving his war-torn country.  “Seven journalists appeared on the list, but I was the only one still in Sudan,” Jibril, 48, told Al Jazeera. “I have since received threats from many people. Two [wrote to me on WhatsApp] and said that after the army kills the RSF, they will come for me next.”      Since fighting erupted in Sudan between the army and the RSF last month, supporters from both sides have threatened journalists for criticising human rights violations by both sides, according to the Sudanese Journalists Syndicate.  The number of journalists who have been targeted or intimidated remains unknown, but Al Jazeera identified six people who were told that they would be hurt or killed if they continued reporting abuses.  Many others have appeared on lists circulating on social media, where those mentioned are accused of betraying Sudan in an apparent effort to incite violence against them. The list that Jibril was on was shared in a private WhatsApp group for Sudanese journalists, but he later discovered it on Facebook, too.  As a veteran television reporter, Jibril has been critical of the army for derailing popular aspirations for democracy by spearheading a coup in October 2021. Now, he fears he could be killed.  “I haven’t taken any position in the war, neither in favour of the RSF or army,” said Jibril. “But the people threatening me keep saying that I should support the army.”      Muzzling dissent  Several journalists also told Al Jazeera that members of the National Congress Party (NCP), which is tied to the political Islamic movement in Sudan and former authoritarian leader Omar al-Bashir, are implicated in intimidating journalists.  Members of the NCP have reportedly smeared civilian politicians and incited violence against medics. Many NCP loyalists also hold senior positions in the army and blame RSF leader Mohamed Hamdan “Hemedti” Dagalo for turning against al-Bashir in the face of a popular uprising in April 2019.  Now, they are claiming that anyone who appears neutral is against the army and with the RSF.  “I don’t know some of the people that threatened me, but others I recognise as [remnants] from al-Bashir’s regime,” said Jibril.      Another journalist, who asked Al Jazeera not to disclose her name for fear of reprisal, said she criticised the RSF in a private WhatsApp group for Sudanese media workers after reports that the paramilitary was raiding and looting homes and raping women.  One member in the group who supports the RSF then sent her an ominous message: “He said, ‘Go ahead and keep talking. I’ll be waiting for you. I’ll be waiting,’” she told Al Jazeera.  “The [threats] are coming from both sides. Supporters of the army are making [threatening] calls and [sending threatening] messages to journalists that they perceive to be pro-RSF and the RSF is making calls to people that they think are pro-army,” said Abdelmoneim Abu Idriss, the elected head of the journalists’ syndicate.  Kholood Khair, a Sudan expert and the founding director of the Confluence Advisory think tank, added that both generals are very clearly aligned in suppressing free speech.  “They are not just against each other … but they are very aligned and have always been aligned … in destroying the parts of the state that they don’t like and parts of Sudanese political life that they don’t like,” she told Al Jazeera.      Raids and attacks  On Thursday, the RSF reportedly stormed the media office of the independent newspaper el-Hirak el-Siyasi to intimidate staff and steal their belongings, according to the syndicate.  In the same week, it reported that an RSF fighter shot photojournalist Faiz Abubakr in the back while he was filming clashes on the street. The RSF then detained, interrogated and beat Abubakr, accusing him of spying for military intelligence.  “Journalists are in real danger,” said Mohamad el-Fatih Yousif, a member of the Sudanese Journalists Network, a press freedom group. “Nobody is allowed to take a neutral position.”  Al Jazeera contacted RSF spokesman and political adviser Youssef Ezzat to ask him about the group’s reported threats and attacks against journalists.  “I didn’t hear about any incidents against journalists and actually the RSF cooperates with journalists and reporters for TV channels,” he said.  None of the journalists who spoke to Al Jazeera described the RSF as cooperative, with some adding that they were thinking of fleeing the country out of fear of being targeted by the group or the army.  ‘Duty to stay in Sudan’  But Abu Idriss said that while he understands why his colleagues would escape Sudan, he believes journalists must stay to offer a factual narrative of the war.  “Both sides in the conflict have their information machines on social media that make fake news, publish hate speech and spread propaganda. For this reason, journalists need to stay, so that we have neutral voices,” he told Al Jazeera.  Abu Idriss added that he won’t leave his colleagues behind as the head of the press syndicate.  “It’s my duty to stay in Sudan,” he said. “I have to try and protect [journalists].”"

E-fuels are direct substitutes for conventional fossil fuels such as petrol, diesel and aviation kerosene. To classify as carbon neutral they must be made from hydrogen generated by electricity from renewable sources and carbon dioxide captured from the atmosphere. Although this carbon dioxide is emitted again when the fuel is burned, there is no net contribution to the atmosphere.  That is the basis for the case e-fuels are environmentally sustainable. However, the current process for producing them, by using renewable electricity to split water and produce hydrogen and then combining it with carbon dioxide under pressure and with the use of a catalyst, is highly energy inefficient.  For Amy Hebert, chief executive of Danish start-up Arcadia eFuels, the last-minute decision taken in March to allow new cars running on e-fuels onto the market represents an opportunity. “It’s a huge step,” she said. While electric vehicles will go a long way to decarbonising road transport, she thinks a substantial market will remain for e-fuels.  “If cars can be electrified, that makes absolute sense. In cases where that can’t happen, and people need to drive long distances, then we believe e-fuels are an appropriate alternative,” she said.  Others are not so sure. Swiss solar fuel producer Synhelion expects the opportunity to be small. “As sustainable fuels are generally used where electrification is difficult to implement, we do not believe that the decision will have a major impact,” said Carmen Murer, the company’s head of corporate communications.  Norsk e-Fuel, headquartered in Oslo, also sees little in the decision to make it change its plans. “We are specifically focusing on the sectors where we know there is currently no alternative if you want to have a substantial impact on reducing emissions quickly,” said Luisa Wagner, the company’s communications manager.  Aviation is seen as the sector where e-fuels will find a home. Electrification is challenging, even for short flights, and the use of e-fuels is backed by legislative quotas. Until March there was no such legislative opening for road e-fuels. And even if the decision is implemented, the automotive industry still needs to get behind it.  “E-fuel projects such as ours are dependent on the industry supporting our plans, and so far we have seen a much stronger interest and drive from the aviation sector,” said Wagner.  The eFuel Alliance, which lobbies for the industry in Brussels, is also clear that the opportunity is not yet in the bag. “It’s just a declaration right now. We need concrete proposals from the Commission, and then to see how these will be worked out,” said Ralf Diemer, the Alliance’s managing director.  e-fuel only vehicles  A road map for implementing the decision is expected by the autumn of 2024. The first step is likely to be a regulation for the type approval of vehicles exclusively powered by e-fuels. Work will also be required to define how these vehicles contribute to carbon dioxide emission reduction targets.  The use of e-fuels in existing vehicles will also receive support in legislation. A revision to the Renewable Energy Directive, also agreed in March, sets a mandatory quota that covers advanced biofuels and e-fuels in the transport sector. The revision also contains an option for a binding sub-quota for renewable fuels of non-biological origin, which covers the direct use of renewable hydrogen as well fuels derived from it. Still subject to confirmation by the Parliament and Council of Ministers, both measures would support the development of a market for e-fuels.  For the industry, there is considerable work to be done to meet the existing mandates for e-fuels in aviation and shipping, let alone any eventual road transport market. Start-ups are important players in doing that.  “The big oil companies are the natural choice for producing these products,” Hebert said, “but the regulatory landscape is still a little bit uncertain for them, and the size of production is smaller than what they are used to, at least at the beginning.” This is because of limitations in renewable energy supply and electrolyser maturity. “So it is up to start-up companies to get this market going.”  Diemer also sees start-ups and scale-ups playing an important role. “Especially when it comes to the technologies around electrolysers, around CO2 technologies, around improving efficiency, a lot of new players are on the field, and they are often start-ups,” he said. “This abundance of start-ups underlines that we are operating in an innovative and emerging market.”  However, for industrial scale production they will have to work with the oil industry. “I don’t think this value chain will be possible without big oil,” Diemer said. “You need a lot of capital, you need the industry’s knowledge and distribution channels to put a product in place. And you might also need to use its refineries.”  He thinks it will be interesting to see how start-ups position themselves as the market evolves, with some electrolyser specialists already broadening their scope to support the whole e-fuel production chain, or moving into production.  This is the case for Ineratec, which in April started work on an e-fuel production plant in Frankfurt. “So far, Ineratec has been a technology producer, but now it has decided to run a first production site by itself, together with partners, and in the end it might end up as a fuel producer,” he said  The chemistry of e-fuel production is well established. One route is the Fischer–Tropsch process, developed in the 1920s to convert coal into liquid fuels. The other is to use hydrogen and carbon dioxide to create methanol, which can then be shipped or stored for use as a fuel feedstock. In both cases the technology is mature, so it would be relatively simple for companies producing e-fuels for one sector to pivot to another if demand changed.  Arcadia eFuels, for example, was set up in 2021 to leverage various technologies for the production of e-fuels in transport applications. The company plans to build its first plant at the Port of Vordingborg in the southern part of Zeeland, with production currently scheduled to begin in 2026.  “With the plants we are building we are able produce e-kerosene for jet fuel, we can produce e-diesel for long-haul trucks, for cars or for the shipping industry, and we also produce naphtha, which is a product that can be used for gasoline blending,” Hebert said.  Intermediate product  Norsk e-Fuel is a consortium formed in 2019 including electrolyser technology company Sunfire and carbon capture specialist Climeworks. The company's first production facility, at Mosjøen in northern Norway, is also due to come on line on 2026, and it recently signed a partnership agreement to supply fuel to Norwegian, Norway’s largest airline.  It uses the Fischer-Tropsch route to produce a synthetic crude oil. “From that intermediate product we can do anything that you do with oil, so from a technical point of view we could easily adapt our process to produce diesel or gasoline,” Wagner said.  Regardless of where the fuel is used, the e-fuel industry faces a number of hurdles when it comes to scaling up production. These include development of carbon capture infrastructure, the availability of renewable energy, and production of the technical components.  And there is scope for further innovation. “Electrolyser efficiency is currently around 70%, but there is no reason that cannot increase to more than 95% over the next five to ten years,” said Hebert.  More work also needs to be done on carbon capture. “The ideal technology is direct air capture, but this is currently too expensive and inefficient for industrial production. So, this will require a lot of research and development,” Diemer said.  Even where technology is proven in other spheres, work is required to apply it to e-fuels. “We are filing several patents on the integration of these technologies, which have never been put together in this way before,” Hebert said. “So there is quite a lot of innovation there, and ways to reduce cost.”  Although the chemical processes involved are mature, there is scope for innovation to provide further efficiencies. Already in its first plant, Norsk e-Fuel is planning to integrate a co-electrolyser based on solid oxide cell technology. This makes it possible to combine two process steps in the conventional approach, and to re-use heat generated in the Fischer-Tropsch process.  “Since electricity is the main cost driver in the production of e-fuels, that means more productivity for any given amount of electricity and less cost for the final product,” Wagner said.  Finally, there needs to be political support for the development of the industry and surrounding value chains. “The challenge lies in the industrial scale-up, which we don’t have right now, since we produce only small amounts of e-fuels,” Diemer said. “Unfortunately, the political framework conditions at EU level are thwarting precisely this ramp-up.”  Investment is particularly challenging for the companies. “The e-fuel projects that are ramping up production now are all first movers,” Wagner said. “It’s a new value chain, a new market, and a new product, and those innovations accumulate. So we need investors who are not too risk averse and ready to take on new opportunities.”  Help is also required if e-fuels are to compete on price with fossil fuels. Hebert draws a parallel with wind and solar energy, whose price has fallen dramatically over the past two decades so that it is now competitive with fossil fuels. “I think the same will be true of e-fuels, but we need more incentives and government support to make that happen,” she said.  The challenge for producers in Europe is that the incentives and penalties are aimed at users, such as airlines, or the fuel distributors, not at the companies making the fuels. “In the US, with the Inflation Reduction Act, the incentives go directly to the producer,” Hebert said. “That means the producer can lower the overall price to the end user, so then you’re sure that more plants will get built.”  One aspect of this political support is stability. In this respect, the March decision on new cars was not necessarily a positive development. Made at the last-minute following strong pressure from the German government, some see it as setting a dangerous precedent.  “Where negotiations have been going for years on decisions that industry needs in order to ramp up production, we think it is dangerous if states can intervene at the last moment,” Wagner said. “So, even if it gives us a market in the future, we concerned about the way it came about.”"

Yet within a few hours, the news was already reverberating on both sides of the Atlantic, with global soccer's governing body soon confirming the Brooklyn-born, London-raised Balogun's one-time switch of allegiance. The intense interest in Balogun's decision is understandable in both countries.  Balogun becomes the latest in a parade of highly regarded young dual citizens to choose the U.S. over more decorated programs in recent years. In 2020, midfielder Yunus Musah also opted for the Stars and Stripes over England; last November, Musah played all 90 minutes in a scoreless draw with the Three Lions at the World Cup.  ""To represent the United States means a lot,"" Balogun said in a press release. ""I'm very proud and honored to have this opportunity, and I want to give everything I have to make our team successful.""  U.S. fans are even more excited about Balogun, who just happens to fill the Americans' most glaring positional need. The 21-year-old has 19 goals in 34 games on loan from the Gunners to French team Reims this season.  Balogun instantly becomes the leading candidate to start at center forward for the Americans in next month's CONCACAF Nations League semifinal against chief rival Mexico.  ""Having the opportunity to play against Mexico in a rivalry match would be amazing,"" he said. ""Hopefully, I can make a difference.""  ADVERTISEMENT  Another recruiting coup for the U.S., maybe the most important yet  Like many countries, the U.S. has been fielding dual nationals for decades. And like most others, they've also lost some along the way — most notably New Jersey product Giuseppe Rossi, who opted to play for Italy in the mid-2000s.  But the Americans have been on a roll since 2019, when then-USMNT coach Gregg Berhalter and then-U.S. Soccer sporting director Earnie Stewart flew to the Netherlands to secure the commitment of fullback Sergiño Dest, who was being aggressively recruited by the Dutch. Musah joined up a year later. So did others during Berhalter's four years at the helm, including forwards Jesús Ferreira (Colombia), Ricardo Pepi (Mexico) and Daryl Dike (Nigeria).  Berhalter and his staff didn't land everyone they wanted. But by and large, U.S. Soccer has been wildly successful in this space in recent years — success that has built on itself.  Musah spent time with Balogun in Arsenal's academy and shared his positive experiences with the U.S. program with his former (and now future) teammate, a source confirmed to FOX Sports. The Americans' showing at the World Cup in Qatar didn't hurt, either, nor did the fact the U.S. will host the Copa America next summer and the World Cup in 2026.  ""It's almost too good to be true,"" Balogun said. ""To have the World Cup in America is just crazy, and then to be the host nation and my first World Cup, it's all come together nicely. Some things are just meant to be.""  However it happened, it's another clear coup for the U.S. And given Balogun's age, pedigree and obvious scoring touch, he has a chance to end up being the most impactful of them all.  No coach? No problem for Balogun  The timing of Balogun's decision says a lot about how far the USMNT has come since failing to qualify for the 2018 World Cup. The program's first contact with the player came last year, through Berhalter. Berhalter's contract expired last year, and while recently hired U.S. Soccer sporting director Matt Crocker insists he's a candidate to return, the uncertainty didn't dissuade Balogun any.  Not only did the USMNT not have a coach when U.S. Soccer rolled out the red carpet for Balogun in Orlando in late March, Crocker wasn't yet on board. Neither was Oguchi Onyewu, who effectively became Crocker's deputy last week. Former USMNT general manager Brian McBride had departed months earlier.  None of that organizational uncertainty moved Balogun to wait to make his choice. The fact he picked the U.S. without even knowing which coach will be making the lineup decisions between now and 2026 speaks to how comfortable he was, how sure he is that playing for his birth nation — which he left at age 2 — is the best option.  ""In the end, it became a no-brainer,"" Balogun said of his decision. ""It feels like I'm at home here.""  That's a testament to the culture that has been built in the American dressing room.  Newcomer could lead American line for years  While Musah and other recent commits lauded how they were immediately accepted by their U.S. teammates, and while the Americans no doubt did all they could to make Balogun feel welcome when he visited their camp, the on-field fit was surely also a factor.  Harry Kane is England's captain and starting striker when healthy, and he's still just 29. Behind him are at least two other established Premier League scorers: Marcus Rashford and Callum Wilson.  The U.S., meanwhile, has been without a clear-cut center forward since Jozy Altidore's days with the national team ended in 2019. Three different men — Ferreira, Haji Wright and Josh Sargent — started games for the Americans at the World Cup. Only Wright scored in Qatar. Balogun has more goals this season than any of them, plus Dike and Pepi, despite playing in a stronger league.  The opportunity for Balogun is clear. He withdrew from England's U-21 camp in March and flew to Florida only after England senior team boss Gareth Southgate didn't name a replacement for the injured Rashford. Now, he's likely to make his full international debut inside a packed NFL stadium in Las Vegas in less than a month, with plenty more high-profile games to follow.  ""It's a really young, energetic squad and for sure the potential of the squad is amazing,"" Balogun said. ""I think I can add my qualities.""  In the end, the chance to quickly establish himself as the guy for the Americans for the better part of the next decade simply was too attractive for Balogun to pass up.

To contribute, click here.  •••  The 10th Ward violence has been a long time coming, and no one cares till it's filmed (""DFL melee is a sign of the times,"" editorial, May 16). The truth is the politics of division and derision were on display during the failed Jan. 6 coup, and at the Minneapolis 10th Ward convention. This is not a Republican or Democratic issue, this is an American political system issue.  What needs to be addressed is not only the behavior of those on the floor; there must be accountability for those running for office and seeking the party endorsement. I lived in the 10th Ward for over a decade, till two years ago. I watched the escalation, especially in the last four years, toward this politics of division, derision and hate: ""Those not supporting me are the enemy.""  The races are not about ideas, a vision of leadership and unity after a hard-fought race. It's us vs. them. You only talk to your base and rile them up by saying in subtle ways that your opponent and their supporters are the enemy.  Until the party stands up and holds the candidates responsible for sparking this and the supporters who follow through with the inevitable violence responsible, nothing will change. The party needs to draw the line. If violence is not the answer, then hold everyone accountable. But we all know nothing will be done and the politics of hate will just grow stronger, and everyone will lose.  David Schlosser, Minneapolis  GUN LEGISLATION  Popular in the abstract  In response to a May 15 letter about gun legislation: Thank for your spirited take on Minnesota's public safety bill. I must, however, correct a few misinterpretations.  Public policy polling doesn't equate to support for specific legislation. The devil, as they say, is in the details. When the minutiae of a policy are revealed, public approval fluctuates dramatically as people learn the actual scope of legislation.  When we question the potential political fallout for Sens. Grant Hauschild, Rob Kupec and Judy Seeberger, we're not issuing threats but merely observing the political pulse of their districts. It's not a threat to predict a storm when the clouds are already gathering.  The ""cloak and dagger"" approach to passing this bill, sneaking language into a 500-plus-page omnibus bill after it never saw the Senate floor, thus avoiding a clear up or down vote, doesn't scream ""confidence in constituent support"" to me. It's more like a shell game meant to obfuscate their intent from their voters. That's not bravery, it's political subterfuge.  And let's touch on the ""independent spirit"" of these senators. On the campaign trail, and even during session, they've pledged to be mavericks, but one glance at their voting record shows they fall in line with their party like ducks in a row. Independence isn't just a word; it's an action. And sometimes, it means disagreeing with your party.  We don't make threats; we advocate for the rights of Minnesota's peaceable gun owners. It'd be nice if our senators did the same.  Rob Doar, Blaine  The writer is a lobbyist for the Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus.  ELECTIONS  State can empower average voters  According to Open Secrets, 2022 national midterm elections fundraising skyrocketed to $8.9 billion, a new record. The U.S. Supreme Court's Citizens United ruling made it legal for corporations to contribute unlimited amounts to campaigns in the name of free speech. Regardless of political affiliations, wealthy special interests look out for themselves, not everyday Americans. Two items at the Minnesota Legislature are flying below the radar that could strengthen our democracy by reducing candidates' dependence on big money.  The first is in the state government and election omnibus bill. It would triple the Campaign Finance Board's public subsidy program for political candidates who register with the board. The public subsidy program was started in 1974 in response to the Watergate scandal. A candidate must sign and file a public subsidy agreement to qualify for the program. They have to abide by the disclosure and fundraising requirements the board sets.  For years the budget has stagnated at $1.2 million per biennium for candidates running for office. That amount comes from the general fund and is equally divided among all candidates of major political parties running for a specified office. If the conference committee includes this provision, it will increase by $2.1 million for fiscal years 2024 and 2025 for a total of $3.3 million. This means less money to raise and more time communicating with voters about the issues that matter to them.  The next is in the Senate tax omnibus bill. The Senate and House have proposed to increase the political contribution reimbursement program from $50 per individual to $75 and for married couples from $100 to $150. If passed, it would increase the proportional importance of small donors and average Minnesotans so that candidates do not depend as much on large contributions, lobbyists or special interests.  Earlier this session the Democracy Dollars bill was introduced that would issue a $25 dollar voucher to each voter to donate to candidates. It didn't advance. Seattle adopted this program in 2015 with great success. It's seen that it not only reduces the influence of big contributors but it encourages more people to run for office, increases the number of voters and gives everyday people a bigger voice in their elections. We've been advocating for a voucher program since 2017 and hope to see it return in the next biennium.  We must restore balance and create a system where every citizen has an equal vote and say. More public financing of campaigns is good for democracy and is a bipartisan issue. We urge the tax committee and the state government and elections conference committee to include these increases in their final reports, for the House and Senate to pass them so they can be signed by the governor and be available for the 2024 election.  Mary Hartnett, Minneapolis  The writer is executive director, Clean Elections Minnesota.  DURHAM REPORT  Where was the detailed coverage?  Admittedly the report by John Durham into the origins of the Trump-Russia collusion allegation was less than the ""blockbuster "" President Donald Trump promised. Nevertheless, the 306-page report should have been treated with far more importance than the Star Tribune gave it, limiting its coverage to two paragraphs on page A6, which reported only that Durham accused the FBI of a ""lack of analytical rigor"" (""Durham issues final Russia inquiry report,"" May 16). With another presidential election on the horizon, Durham's findings should have been given far more comprehensive coverage.  Durham's conclusion that the FBI ""failed to uphold their important mission of strict fidelity to the law"" when it launched its investigation into the Trump campaign using ""seriously flawed information"" is of major importance if we are to avoid a repeat in 2024. His finding that the FBI rushed to investigate the Trump campaign even as it proceeded cautiously on allegations related to his Democratic opponent suggests it favored one candidate over another. Its disparate treatment went even further, giving defensive briefings to the Clinton campaign that were denied the Trump campaign. The report went so far as to suggest the FBI should have considered whether it was being ""manipulated for political or other purposes.""  Democracy is threatened when its premier intelligence agency demonstrates a clear preference of one candidate over another. That is the importance of the Durham report, and for that reason it merited far more comprehensive coverage than it was given by this paper.  Ronald Haskvitz, Golden Valley"

Since the country’s transition to democracy in 2010, it has faced pressure to implement effective reforms and regulations for companies, particularly in relation to foreign investments. One crucial aspect of these reforms has been the protection of human rights (HR) violated by corporations. However, due to the Military Coup in February 2021, legal reform progress has been halted, and the country is now facing even more serious human rights violations. Therefore, this article aims to shed light on the problems with existing laws and enforcement mechanisms concerning human rights violations from an Environmental Human Rights (EHR) perspective. Additionally, it proposes potential solutions under the current circumstances.  Legal Framework  In Myanmar, the concept of corporate crime is relatively new to regulators and law enforcement agencies. This is evident in the recent laws that regulate the Environmental Human Rights (EHR) Protection Agenda. The notion of corporate social responsibility related to EHR was only introduced in 2012 through the Environmental Conservation Law and the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (EIA) Procedure in 2015. Other regulatory developments include the Myanmar Investment Law and Rules, which establish a licensing procedure for projects with significant environmental and community impacts, the Conservation of Biodiversity and Protected Area Law of 2018, and the Forest Law of 2018. For the purpose of this article, these laws will be collectively referred to as “the Legal Framework.”  Despite the existence of this Legal Framework, exploitation and abuses persist, indicating its ineffectiveness in deterring companies from committing EHR violations. Thus, this article aims to identify the reasons why the Legal Framework falls short in deterring EHR offenses and explore alternative approaches to achieve deterrence.  Issues  According to American legal philosopher Lon L. Fuller, a successful legal system must possess the following characteristics: (1) generality, (2) publicity, (3) prospectivity, (4) clarity, (5) consistency, (6) stability, (7) capacity to be performed, and (8) congruence (Fuller’s eight principles). The failure of the Legal Framework in Myanmar may be attributed to a lack of adherence to some of these principles. A more comprehensive examination is required to determine which of the eight principles are lacking in the Legal Framework. This article primarily highlights issues related to congruence and clarity.  The issues identified in this article are as follows:  1) Inefficiency of Punishments  The Legal Framework criminalizes all environmental offenses, and the available punishments are divided into three categories: civil penalties, administrative penalties, and criminal actions. Administrative penalties empower relevant government agencies to impose fines, business suspension or closure, and blacklisting, among other measures. Alternatively, civil and criminal actions can be pursued, with prosecutors presenting cases before the court for stronger sanctions such as imprisonment or larger fines, in accordance with the Attorney-General of the Union Law of 2010. Notably, prosecutors in Myanmar do not currently possess the discretion to enter into Deferred Prosecution Agreements (DPAs) or Non-Prosecution Agreements (NPAs) that would incentivize organizational reform. Consequently, it can be concluded that the Legal Framework in Myanmar leans towards retribution and deterrence theories rather than the reformative theory.  To effectively deter corporate crimes, the laws should be designed to increase the costs and reduce the profitability associated with such offenses, given the profit-driven nature of companies. However, the available sanctions under the Legal Framework are insufficient to shift this balance.  Under the existing Framework, the highest fine for environmental offenses is set at USD 10,000.  Although this amount may carry significance for individuals, it represents a low risk for companies engaged in investments that can have a substantial impact on the environment. Additionally, administrative officials have the authority to impose other penalties alongside fines. However, the lack of clear guidelines is a legal concern. As Professor Fuller mentioned in his aforementioned book, “Obscure and incoherent legislation can make legality unattainable by anyone, or at least unattainable without an unauthorized revision, which itself impairs legality.” When officers are granted discretionary power without proper guidelines, the consideration for effective deterrence is often overlooked. For instance, under the Forest Law, the arresting Forest Officer possesses the authority to cancel permits as a form of punishment. However, there are no rules or guidelines regarding the determination of such penalties, such as considering the scale of the offense, the nature of the offender, or the impact of the offense. Consequently, it is less likely that corporate offenders are deterred from committing crimes.  It is worth noting that some of these laws allow for criminal sanctions, where the amount of fines is determined based on the judge’s discretion. Although this represents progress towards achieving deterrence, it can also be ineffective for three reasons:  Court procedures are often time-consuming, which may delay addressing urgent environmental issues. There is a lack of guidelines for judges to consider factors such as the size of the company and the scale of the impact. Most judges have limited exposure to large companies and environmental assessments, which can hinder their ability to impose larger fines.  2) Compliance and Enforcement Issues  Congruence between official action and the law is essential for the functioning of a legal system. One factor that can impair congruence is “stupidity.” Strong evidence of this can be observed in the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Procedure and its implementation gap. The World Bank’s 2019 Report identified issues with the implementation of the EIA procedure, highlighting the slow progress in approvals. For example, out of 1,971 Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) submitted, only 112 were approved in 2019. Compared to the data from 2018, the approval rate had only increased by 4. The report also recognized the limited technical capacity and resources of the EIA Division to effectively review EIAs/IEEs/EMPs. These findings demonstrate that the existing EIA procedure cannot function properly given the current capacity of the officers.  Professor Fuller has pointed out additional challenges to congruence, including bribery, prejudice, and the pursuit of personal power, collectively known as “corruption.” In 2022, Myanmar ranked 157 out of 180 countries in Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index, marking a new low in the ranking after the Military took over the country in February 2021. Prior to the coup, corruption in Myanmar was monitored by the Anti-Corruption Commission. However, following the conviction and accusation of corruption against State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the commission lost its credibility. This situation has created opportunities for government officials to engage in corruption. Furthermore, the new political situation has caused a 16% rise in the inflation index, leading to socio-economic difficulties in the country. This puts significant strain on government officials whose salaries are already low. Additionally, due to the revolution, many government officials have joined the Civil Disobedience Movement, resulting in a labor shortage within the government system. As a result, those who choose to remain in the system become susceptible to corruption either due to personal strain or the lack of supervision and opportunity. The prevalence of corruption among officials has created a culture of neutrality, further exacerbating the issue.  This corruption incentivizes the growth of corporate crimes in the country due to the administrative discretionary power held by government officials, as mentioned earlier. This situation is particularly problematic in cases of environmental offenses, as most issues and complaints arise from communities in remote areas where large-scale projects are taking place. Consequently, this corruption has undermined the effectiveness of the Legal Framework intended to deter offenders.  Solution  Under normal circumstances, these issues could be addressed through legislative amendments, training programs, or rigorous monitoring. However, given the ongoing unrest in Myanmar, creative solutions are required.  In Myanmar, the People’s Republic of China (China) is the second-largest investor, reportedly holding 23.48% of foreign investments. Specifically, many small-scale Myanmar operations in the mining sector, particularly in border areas, receive informal backing from Chinese capital. These projects are expanding rapidly after the coup and are unlikely to comply with environmental standards. The corrupted local officials and military regime are unwilling to interfere with these projects due to their shared private interests. This article proposes that this situation could be addressed through the implementation of Human Rights Due Diligence (HRDD) measures mandated by the EU Directive on Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence.  According to the Interpretive Guide to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights provided by OHCHR, HRDD is “an ongoing management process that a reasonable and prudent enterprise needs to undertake, in light of its circumstances (including sector, operating context, size, and similar factors) to meet its responsibility to respect human rights.” While the concept of HRDD is reflected in many international standards, none of these standards, principles, and guidelines are legally binding or require corporations to actively engage. This lack of binding requirements hampers corporate compliance. However, a new EU Directive aims to change this. Under this Directive, EU companies will be obligated to conduct due diligence throughout their entire value chain, including subsidiaries and cross-border independent third parties, to ensure the protection of human rights and the environment, regardless of the presence or absence of laws in third countries. This obligation expands the corporate liability of EU companies and imposes pecuniary fines, compensations, or other legal remedies for HR and EHR violations committed by their affiliated companies.  Being the major actor in global value chain, Chinese companies work closely with the companies in the EU Market. In fact, China holds $770 million FDI in the EU. The Directive, therefore, will surely have impact not only on the local Chinese companies but also those in the third-world countries like Myanmar where the productions of raw materials are taking place. This impact will, hopefully, indirectly help reducing the HR and EHR violations in Myanmar.  Conclusion"

AFP via Getty Images  One month after fighting between Sudan's two military factions broke out in the capital, Khartoum, internationally-brokered peace talks in Saudi Arabia have yielded no solution. Airstrikes and artillery continued to pound the country's capital and surrounding regions in recent days, and violence has also spread to the long-embattled Darfur region in the west. The International Rescue Committee (IRC) said Monday that more than 600 people had been killed and over 5,000 injured as a result of the fighting. The real toll is expected to be far higher. Almost a million people have fled their homes, both to locations within Sudan and across the border to neighboring countries. Meanwhile, those who have stayed put often have no access to essentials despite a commitment from the two warring factions to restore access to food and electricity. Prices of food and fuel have soared, exacerbating malnutrition and hammering the local economy. Warring generals Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, leader of the Sudanese Armed Forces, and Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (or ""Hemedti""), leader of the Rapid Support Forces, show no signs of halting the conflict as they vie for total control of the state's military and government, natural resources and 46 million inhabitants. The U.S., U.N. and Saudi Arabia are brokering talks between the two sides, though tentative cease-fires and commitments to allow humanitarian corridors into the sprawling country have collapsed almost immediately.  'The needs are immense'  The IRC warned Monday that the humanitarian situation will continue to deteriorate unless all parties involved prioritize the protection of civilians. ""We know there are many uncertainties for people right now, but one thing that's clear is the needs are immense, immediate and will be for a long time,"" said IRC Vice President for East Africa Kurt Tjossem. ""The longer they remain in these conditions, the more vulnerable they become to disease, hunger, and other hardships."" Things have come a long way from 2021 when Burhan and Hemedti led a military coup that ousted the civilian government of Abdalla Hamdok. Since then, the SAF and RSF had been sharing power in Khartoum to facilitate what most Sudanese citizens hoped would be a transition back to civilian rule. The World Bank and several global powers froze aid to the country after the military takeover, honoring calls from civilians not to legitimize its leadership. However, Burhan and Hemedti's divergent political visions were never reconciled, and the fragile power-sharing arrangement began to unravel in early April, culminating in the breakout of a full-scale conflict in Khaartoum on April 15.

Amanuel Sileshi / AFP via Getty Images  In a speech at the UN Human Rights Council last week, U.K. Minister for International Development and Africa Andrew Mitchell stressed the importance of the international community in helping to revert Sudan to the ""political track"" by sending a ""united message of concern and of horror"" and breaking the ""cycle of impunity in Sudan."" Yet many Sudanese believe that despite the efforts of various regional and international bodies, the Jeddah talks — lacking a substantial civilian voice and the threat of harsh international sanctions against the generals and their respective inner circles — will not be part of the solution.  Rewarding 'belligerence'  Sudanese-Australian writer, broadcaster and activist Yassmin Abdel-Magied told CNBC last week that global leaders had inadvertently given Burhan and Hemedti political legitimacy and rewarded their ""belligerence,"" leaving the majority of Sudanese who long for civilian government unrepresented. Both the SAF and RSF benefit from financial and political support from foreign powers including Egypt, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Libya, the University of Cambridge's Associate Professor Sharath Srinivasan told CNBC last month. While Benjamin Hunter from risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft, said these close relationships make it more difficult for a resolution to the conflict to be found imminently. Targeted and collaborative efforts by the international community to exert pressure on the countries supporting Sudan's military factions were needed, Abdel-Magied said. ""If [their] resource[s], financial and otherwise, can be throttled, then we might actually be able to find the right kind of incentive that's going to make them stop fighting,"" she told CNBC via telephone.  watch now"

The air strikes, explosions and clashes could be heard in the south of Khartoum, and there was heavy shelling across the River Nile in parts of the adjoining cities of Bahri and Omdurman, witnesses said.  The fighting between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has triggered unrest in other areas of Sudan, especially in the western region of Darfur, but is concentrated in Khartoum.  It has caused a humanitarian crisis that threatens to destabilise the region,displacing more than 700,000 people inside Sudan and forcing about 200,000 to flee into neighbouring countries.  ""The situation is unbearable. We left our house to go to a neighbour's house in Khartoum, escaping from the war, but the bombardment follows us wherever we go,"" said Ayman Hassan, a 32-year-old resident.  ""We don't know what the citizens did to deserve a war in the middle of the houses.""  Fighting has surged both in Khartoum and in Geneina, capital of West Darfur, since the two warring parties began talks in Jeddah brokered by Saudi Arabia and the United States more than a week ago.  The talks have produced a statement of principles around providing access for aid supplies and protecting civilians, but mechanisms for setting up humanitarian corridors and agreeing to a ceasefire are still being discussed.  The army has relied mainly on air strikes and shelling, only occasionally engaging in ground fighting, as it tries to push back RSF forces that took up positions in neighbourhoods across Khartoum soon after the fighting erupted on April 15.  The RSF attacked major military bases in northern Omdurman and southern Khartoum on Tuesday in an apparent attempt to prevent the army from deploying heavy weaponry and fighter jets, residents and witnesses said.  The army has been trying to cut off RSF supply lines from outside the capital and to secure strategic sites including the airport in central Khartoum and the major Al-Jaili oil refinery in Bahri.  The war began after disputes over plans for the RSF to join the army and the future chain of command under an internationally backed deal for a political transition towards civilian rule and elections.  Army chief General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, took the top positions on Sudan's ruling council following the 2019 overthrow of former leader Omar al-Bashir during a popular uprising.  They staged a coup two years later as a deadline to hand power to civilians approached, but both sides began to mobilise their forces as mediators tried to finalise the new transition plan.

Footage of that evening, on 20 November 1970, was broadcast live from the Royal Albert Hall in London to about 100 million viewers worldwide, and shows Hosten, representing Grenada, looking radiantly beautiful and endearingly stunned, as host Bob Hope places the winner’s crown on her head.  Her moment in the spotlight had already been overshadowed, however. Approximately 40 minutes earlier, the proceedings were interrupted when a group of women’s liberation activists began sounding football rattles and throwing flour-bombs in protest at what they saw as an egregious display of sexism.  Hosten, who was backstage at that point, could only hear the demonstrators. “I don’t think I was scared,” she says, “but the sound made us wonder what was going on. People thought the contest had come to an end.” Once order was restored, a visibly shaken Hope returned to the stage and attempted to assign meaning to the melee: “I want to tell you anybody that would try to break up an affair as wonderful as this … with these wonderful girls from the entire world, have got to be on some kind of dope!”  Hosten as Miss World in 1970. Photograph: Bill Zygmant/REX/Shutterstock  In the half-century since, Miss World 1970 has been touted as an example of the need for “intersectional feminism”, before the phrase had even been invented. Was the contest ever really intended as a celebration of international womanhood? Or was it always just an organised excuse for an ogle? Either way, in the eye of the storm, Miss World herself found some clarity: “It seemed like all these things were supposed to happen, that it was meant to be,” says Hosten, who is now 75, from her home just outside Toronto, Canada. “At that point, I realised how much I had to do on my own.”  Even if the event made her a global celebrity, Miss World was by no means the culmination of Hosten’s career: she would go on to travel the world, meet movie stars and heads of state, obtain several advanced degrees and have a ringside seat for history in the making. She has very much written her own script.  Hosten was born in 1947 in St George’s, the picturesque capital of her Caribbean island home, the youngest of five children. It was an idyllic childhood, characterised by morning sea-swims and evenings spent gathered around the radio, which fostered a patriotism that Hosten has carried throughout her life. “When I look back on my childhood I realise I really was quite blessed,” she says. “We didn’t know about drugs and we didn’t have social media to contend with. We made our own fun.”  Jennifer Hosten with her brother Robin, her mother and father, and her sister Pommie. Photograph: Sutherland House  As her parents were professionals – her father a prominent lawyer, her mother a schoolteacher – there were standards to live up to, but the family were not part of any island elite, she says. “Grenada is a small community, so the structures are not so defined, not like in England,” although she describes Grenadians at the time as more class conscious than colour conscious. “Most of us were of mixed blood,” she says, and describes her own heritage as including African, Scottish, Flemish and Carib Indian.  The radio was Hosten’s main window into a world beyond Grenada, and after leaving school, she pursued a career in broadcasting, eventually travelling to London, aged 18, to enrol on a BBC training scheme. After nearly two years in the UK, and six months as an au pair in France, she returned to Grenada a cosmopolitan, bilingual, polished woman of 20 – an ideal candidate to work as a flight attendant for British West Indies Airways.  It was in this role that a series of events – “what you might consider coincidences, which I don’t think are coincidences, really” – propelled her towards her date with destiny at the Royal Albert Hall. There was a fateful in-flight meeting with the recently crowned Miss Guyana; happening to pick up a discarded newspaper reporting Grenada’s plans to send a representative to Miss World; and bumping into an old friend whose mother was the head of Grenada’s tourist board. He persuaded Hosten to compete, suggesting Miss World would be no different from the traditional carnival queen contests she had participated in as a teenager. “They were never really about beauty. They were always more about promoting the culture of the island,” she says. “Throughout the Caribbean, you were considered ‘attractive’, rather than ‘beautiful’; and that meant that you had a nice smile, that you presented yourself well.”  I can’t believe that’s how I answered questions! It makes you cringe, you know?  Miss World was very different. “The objectification was exemplified by having to turn around for your backside to be judged,” she says. “Even back then, it was shocking, because I never had to do that in Grenada. And it was shocking to my daughter, who later saw the contest. She was embarrassed for me. She said: ‘Oh Mum, I can’t imagine that you had to do that!’” Hosten is also a little embarrassed for her younger self, watching the footage back. “It seems so corny. I can’t believe that’s how I answered questions! It makes you cringe, you know? But that’s what it was.”  Her win made the front pages around the world, but Hosten was disturbed by the tone of much of the reporting. “The first time I ever saw myself as a minority was when I came to England for Miss World, because the day after I won, the headline was: Miss World is Black,” she says. “I found it shocking that your colour or race should be a headline … because even if they thought of me as Black, was that the most important thing for them to be highlighting?”  The same articles often included allegations that the contest must have been rigged, since the judging panel included the Grenadian premier, Eric Gairy. Hosten found this risible: “There were three British judges, there was also an African judge, a judge from Denmark, I think there was a judge from India … and all of a sudden, the one from Grenada should have made the difference?” It seemed to her the fuss was a cover for their true objections: “It was really because there were two women of colour [Pearl Jansen, Miss Africa South, placed second], and the fact that I wasn’t the standard European type of winner. [In their minds] I could not possibly, naturally, have been able to win. It was hurtful.”  Protesters invade the Royal Albert Hall during the 1970 Miss World contest. Photograph: Leonard Burt/Getty Images  Coming face to face with the women’s lib protesters was, by comparison, less disconcerting. When crowds singing the protest song We Shall Overcome accosted an official Miss World coach en route to the Royal Albert Hall that day, she remembers some of the contestants on board joined in the singing. “Well, at one level we thought, this is a women’s demonstration, and we’re women.” Hosten says she agreed with much of what the UK women’s liberation movement had to say, but they made one great tactical error: “They never reached out to us at any point in time, to explain anything about what they were trying to achieve, or who they were against.”  If they had, she would have tried to describe to them her experience – as a woman of colour from one of the smallest nations in the world – and how it might differ from theirs, as white women in the UK. “I was able to represent women that really had not had an opportunity like this. And let’s be frank: it was a stepping stone for most of us. I never saw myself as a beauty contest winner, really. I saw it as an opportunity, which I took, to have an experience, and to make some money!”  At that time, the simple fact of a Black woman being proclaimed the world’s “most beautiful” sent a powerfully countercultural message. While the “Black is beautiful” movement had been challenging internalised racism among African Americans since the early 1960s, in much of the western world the existence of women with darker skin tones or afro hair textures was ignored by the media and the cosmetics industry. “It was always a job to find something that would really complement my skin,” says Hosten. “When I won, no cosmetic companies or hair product companies contacted me to advertise for them, as they had done for previous Miss Worlds.”  Hosten realised she was also carrying a banner for long underrepresented women of colour from all over the world: “I think I was one of the first Miss Worlds to be invited to Africa, for instance. I didn’t accept the invitation to South Africa, during the height of apartheid, but I did go to Nigeria, and pass through Ghana, and they were wonderful to me, just like a homecoming.”  Hosten and Bob Hope on Hope’s Christmas tour of US military bases. Photograph: AP  If Hosten’s only goal had been personal advancement, she’d likely have parlayed her Miss World fame into a showbiz career. There was ample opportunity, including all the contacts she made on Bob Hope’s Christmas tour of US military bases. Despite Hope’s self-perpetuated reputation as a womaniser, she describes the man she got to know as an avuncular, if slightly detached figure, who continued to send her a Christmas card every year for decades afterwards. “It was only ever addressed to ‘Miss World, Jennifer Hosten, Grenada’, but somehow it always got to me.” Then there was a teatime tête-à-tête at Joan Crawford’s New York home, which Hosten remembers as a flurry of small dogs and big hats, during which the Hollywood star personally invited Hosten to enrol at her acting school. Instead, after fulfilling her year of contractual obligations, she went a different way.  Many beauty queens claim to strive for “world peace”, but few have put those words into action as literally as Hosten has. A year after Miss World, she married a Canadian IBM manager named David Craig and set up home with him in rural Ontario, where they raised two children and Hosten did the daily commute to her customer relations job at Air Canada on a snowmobile. One day in 1978, however, she received a phone call from Gairy, by then the Grenadian prime minister, inviting her to serve as high commissioner (equivalent to ambassador) to Canada.  Being a woman meant she was expected to be ambassador and ambassador’s wife, combining her diplomatic duties with the full domestic schedule of a mother of two. “I would have to come home and plan the cocktail parties, organise the childcare. I remember an occasion where [former Canadian PM] Pierre Trudeau came to my home and read the children a bedtime story … That was quite special.” Special, but also a nightmare of parenting logistics: “I was the one that had to arrange for them to actually go to bed, and here I was, also the ambassador.”  Any notion that this would be a ceremonial role was soon dramatically disproven. “I was returning from a UN meeting in Ecuador when the government fell,” she says, referring to the 1979 coup in Grenada led by Maurice Bishop, the leader of the Marxist-Leninist New Jewel Movement (NJM) and an old acquaintance from her London days. “I had to very quickly use whatever skills I had, and get recognition for the new government. I think I was instrumental in that, actually.” Hosten stayed on until 1981, through what would turn out to be one of her nation’s most tumultuous chapters. She is critical of the fallen Gairy government, describing it as “verging on authoritarian” and presiding over a long discontented populace: “The people wanted independence [from Britain, which happened in 1974], but they didn’t want independence under that government.” The NJM government, however, soon descended into something “much worse … total abuse of power, the doing away of all freedoms”. In 1983 Bishop was executed by dissident members of his own party, triggering a US invasion. These are events that Hosten is still sorting through in her mind. “There is actually much more to that story that I can tell, that I will sometime write about. I don’t know if they’ll ever publish it.”  With their children grown up and their careers taking them to different countries, Hosten and her husband divorced after 28 years of “a fairly good marriage”. She went on to marry – and separate – twice more and accept other high-level diplomatic and trade roles, including at the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States and Canada’s High Commission in Bangladesh before, aged 60, retraining once again, as a psychotherapist and counsellor. These days Hosten is a proud grandmother who enjoys a close relationship with her family, as well as keeping in touch with the many friends she has made around the world. Throughout all her reinventions, she has retained the grace and sincerity that won her that 1970 title.  Hosten at the Misbehaviour premiere in London, in 2020. Photograph: PA Images/Alamy  In 2020, the events of the 1970 Miss World were dramatised in the movie Misbehaviour, with Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Hosten and Keira Knightley as Sally Alexander, the organiser of the women’s rights protest. It was during the publicity tour for Misbehaviour, listening to Knightley discuss her choice of acting roles, that Hosten landed on a useful analogy forher own sense of identity: “She’s played pirates in the Caribbean, and been in Jane Austen adaptations, and lots of other types of movies, because actresses don’t like to be typecast,” she says. “Well, people don’t want to be typecast … I didn’t want to be remembered just as a beauty contest winner, because there are so many other sides to us.”  This plurality of womanhood is what Hosten hoped – and still hopes – to convey: “I don’t know how far [the women’s movement] has come in the sense of really including the interests of a broader section of women,” she concludes. “But I do think they achieved a great deal and I really have to congratulate them. What, it seems to me, is still missing, is asking: who are we to be limiting the roles of other women?”"

The powerful cyclone came ashore in Myanmar's Rakhine state near Sittwe, with wind speeds of up to 130mph, according to the country's meteorological department.  Figures for the number of deaths in Myanmar - a country run by military leadership following a 2021 coup - have yet to be independently verified.  State media, which is tightly controlled by the military junta, have reported around two dozen deaths and hundreds of others injured due to Mocha.  However, residents of the western region of Rakhine state, where there is a large population of Rohingya Muslims, said at least 100 people had died and many more were missing and feared dead.  Scroll across the before-and-after pictures to see the extent of the damage in the city of Sittwe, where homes have been destroyed, roofs have collapsed and public buildings left damaged.  As much as 90% of the city has reportedly been destroyed, while the area has been declared a natural disaster zone.  Others images show what is left of a coastal road and bridge covered in seawater and dirt thrown up from the storm.  Pictures from inside the town show paths and roads blocked off in the aftermath of the cyclone.  Before-and-after images also show the significant damage to Sittwe University - a technical university focused on science and engineering.  The pictures show a number of buildings on the campus with collapsed roofs and blown-out windows.  In other images, an old lighthouse, which remains as a historical landmark, appears unscathed, while a number of buildings around it appear damaged by the cyclone.  The storm is one of the worst since Cyclone Nargis swept across parts of southern Myanmar - one of Asia's least developed nations - killing nearly 140,000 people in 2008.  Thousands of people living along the western coast of Rakhine state were evacuated or moved into shelters before the cyclone came ashore.  Story continues  But at camps for displaced Rohingya, the presence of aid agencies is spotty and help from the country's military government is negligible.  At the world's largest refugee camp in neighbour Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar district, Rohingya from Myanmar were moved to safer areas until Cyclone Mocha passed - potentially saving thousands of lives.  Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said in total more than 700,000 people were moved to cyclone shelters or makeshift facilities including schools and mosques.  On Monday, rescuers evacuated about 1,000 people trapped by seawater 3.6 meters (12 feet) deep along western Myanmar's coast."

The shipment included blankets, kitchen sets and mosquito nets for 500 families, the IFRC said in a statement.  Another shipment was expected in the coming days containing medical supplies.  “Most of our aid supplies were already distributed to people in need, despite some being looted in Khartoum and Darfur,” said IFRC Regional Director for Africa Mohammed Mukhier. “So, this international humanitarian shipment comes at a crucial time as it will help the Sudanese Red Crescent Society to assist people caught between the conflict and the next flooding, which is typical in the country.”  Since the fighting broke out more than a month ago, at least 600 people have been killed, according to the World Health Organization.  The conflict has displaced more than 700,000 people within Sudan, while another 200,000 have fled to neighboring countries, the United Nations said.  The Sudanese army, led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, is battling the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, led by General Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo.  The two generals are former allies who together orchestrated an October 2021 military coup that derailed a transition to civilian rule following the 2019 ouster of longtime leader Omar al-Bashir.  Tensions between the generals have been growing over disagreements about how the Rapid Support Forces should be integrated in the army and who should oversee that process. The restructuring of the military was part of an effort to restore the country to civilian rule and end the political crisis sparked by the 2021 military coup.  Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters."

He aims to turn up the pressure on the ruling junta, and cut off their financial resources, and he sees this week's G7 summit in Hiroshima as an opportunity.  Kyaw Moe Tun has been a thorn in the side of Myanmar's military regime ever since it seized power in a February 2021 coup. He was appointed ambassador to the United Nations under the democratically elected administration of Aung San Suu Kyi and remains loyal to the democratic government in exile.  The regime has tried more than once to unseat Kyaw Moe Tun, but the UN committee that oversees his tenure has so far allowed him to remain in the role, which he is now using to call for international support to restore democracy in his country.  ""The military has committed serious human rights violations amounting to the crisis, humanity, and war crimes,"" he says. ""It includes massacres, indiscriminate and disproportionate aerial bombings, wholesale burning of homes, and destroying our schools and hospitals. So many innocent people, including women and children, were brutally killed by the military.""  The pro-democracy National Unity Government, or NUG, says at least 168 people, including children aged 5 or younger, were killed in the Sagaing region on a single day in April. It is believed to be the deadliest attack since the junta seized power.  Human rights group Assistance Association for Political Prisoners says that more than 3,500 people have been killed by the military since the coup, and the UN's refugee agency UNHCR says nearly 1.5 million people have been internally displaced.  Kyaw Moe Tun gave a three-finger salute at a UN General Assembly meeting in February 2021, a gesture that shows resistance against the military.  Kyaw Moe Tun is calling for an end to the violence and a return to democracy. He says it is essential to cut the military off from its revenue.  ""G7 leaders should urge the international community, in particular the countries in the region to stand firm with the people of Myanmar to stop financial flow to the military,"" he says.  The Japanese government decided in 2021 that it would provide no new Official Development Assistance (ODA) to Myanmar. The Foreign Ministry says Japan provided 1.4 billion dollars worth in fiscal year 2019. But the government also said it would follow through on aid projects already promised.  The ambassador has rejected the junta's demands that he step down. In August 2021, investigators in the US uncovered a plot to assassinate him. But he continues to urge the international community to cut the military's funding sources and sees the upcoming G7 summit in Hiroshima as a chance for those nations to use their collective leverage.  ""G7 leaders should urge the international community, in particular the countries in the region to stand firm with the people of Myanmar to stop financial flow to the military. I just want to urge Japan not to normalize engagement with the military junta when the military is killing its own people and committing area attacks on civilians,"" he says.  Kyaw Moe Tun says he hopes the situation in Myanmar is one of the main items on the agenda at the summit.  ""There are so many pressing issues in the world, from climate change to conflicts, including the Russian aggression against Ukraine,"" he says. ""No doubt G7 leaders will pay attention to all these pressing issues. Myanmar is also one of the pressing issues that world leaders should pay attention to. It already has implications for regional peace and stability."""

Less international attention would usually attach to Turkey’s presidential race but when critical alliances are at stake, results matter far beyond the Golden Horn.  This vote is a reminder that autocracy is not easily dislodged. Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s AKP (Justice and Development Party) has channelled regional resentments, Islamic frustration, strongman fantasies, and grudges against the country’s business and cultural elites to consolidate power for the best part of 20 years.  The result — Erdogan won just under 50 per cent of the vote, putting him in pole position in the run-off in a fortnight — is a setback. But it is not terribly surprising in a country where to be an opponent of the ruling party is an uphill struggle. Visiting Turkey for the past decade, each encounter has featured some conversation which provides a glimpse of over-weening power. Newspaper editors and publishers who refused to toe the line are stripped of jobs and assets. Professional groups who raise concerns about unsafe building practices, the backdrop to the country’s recent harrowing earthquake, find their leaders facing onerous “investigations”. The tax system is routinely used as a weapon against companies disfavoured by a corrupt and economically reckless leadership. The 2016 coup attempt was followed by a ferocious reckoning and waves of imprisonment — and a school curriculum bent since with Maoist determination to write history only as Erdogan would like it to be read.  Like many modern power-grabbers he also has support and the combination of that defiant base and the pre-electoral advantages of media domination, corruption and intimidation have won him 49.4 per cent of the vote. His centre-Left opponent Kemal KÄ±lÄ±çdaroÄlu, meanwhile, has underperformed in this election. Now both parties will scrap it out for the three million or so votes of the third party. It looks like a better shot for the incumbent. Erdogan also has a performer’s ability to hold the limelight. Mocking his rival, who had filmed campaign ads in his modest kitchen, Erdogan took to his party HQ balcony boasting, “Some are in the kitchen, we are on the balcony” and singing to the crowd. All this while insisting that Twitter bans opposition and anti-corruption accounts in the run-up to the vote.  Story continues  In short order, another Erdogan victory would be a headache for both Volodomyr Zelensky and Rishi Sunak, who held talks yesterday to advance UK support for supplying additional weapons to Ukraine to supplement a decisive counter-offensive against Russia — and training Ukrainian pilots to use Nato standard F-16 jets.  Turkey is already the main strategic beneficiary of the war. It serves the Kremlin’s interests by undermining Nato’s unity, helps Russia dodge Western sanctions and reaps dubious construction deals with cash advances to bail out an ongoing financial crisis.  Russia and China are the new “lenders of last resort” in a shaken global system, prepared to spend lavishly to buy loyalty or at least fealty. Erdogan’s prosperity track record is a sham — poor Turks struggle to buy staple goods.  Erdogan has played an advanced game of Risk, leveraging favours from both sides in the war. That is unlikely to change. Crucially, as an early member of Nato, Turkey has a central but often conflicted role in a security alliance on which the Ukraine war outcome depends. The blocking of Swedish accession is a signal of its ability to deploy cunning brinkmanship when its support can command a bidding war for favours and trade deals.  It’s no coincidence that one of the most astute James Bond novel plots, From Russia With Love, is set in Turkey as Soviet-inspired and Western spies battle it out for technological superiority. That fiction has roared back to life, with a 21st-century twist — an authoritarian leader eroding a fragile democracy and a doomed economic model.  That also poses a conundrum for the West — how far to indulge a wayward ally whose values are all wrong but who may re-emerge as key to a vital but vulnerable security compact? The nail-biting election will be decided in weeks. The consequences will resonate across Europe and beyond, down the decades.  Anne McElvoy is Executive Editor at Politico"

It is a remarkable journey for Hagabimana, who just eight years ago was jailed in his native Burundi for refusing to open fire on anti-government protesters as a high-ranking officer of the National Police.  It would also be a historic win in a country where migrants rarely hold official posts and where, less than a decade ago, the extreme-right Golden Dawn party was the third-most popular political force on a fiercely anti-immigrant agenda.  Dressed in a suit and tie, Hagabimana walks the streets of the constituency he is contesting in Greece’s May 21 election, meeting voters in farmers’ markets and cafes.  “I have an opinion about racism,” Hagabimana, 54, now a senior migration ministry official and candidate with the conservative New Democracy party, told Reuters in an interview.  “Racism cannot be fought with words alone. Racism is fought with everyday actions. When the other person is afraid of the unknown, you must give them an opportunity to come into contact with what they are afraid of.”  In a sign that Greek society is beginning to change, another Black candidate, Nikodimos-Maina Kinyua, the Kenyan-born founder of ASANTE, a non-governmental organization helping migrants, is also running with the leftist Syriza party in Athens, though he is seen as having less of a chance of winning a seat.  The district where Hagabimana is running, which includes the poverty-hit town of Perama and island of Salamina, just west of Athens, was a bastion of Golden Dawn at the height of Greece’s economic crisis in 2015.  Golden Dawn later imploded and its leaders were jailed over hate crimes in 2020.  For Hagabimana, it meant Greece had turned a page.  “(Golden Dawn) executives were in parliament. Now they’re in prison. I have faith in the Greek people,” he said.  ‘I WOULD HAVE BEEN FINISHED’  Hagabimana first arrived in Greece in 1991 on a scholarship to study at the Naval Academy.  When he graduated in 1996, Burundi was roiled by a military coup and he was forced to seek asylum in Greece. He studied law and joined New Democracy’s youth wing.  In 2005, the year he received Greek citizenship, Burundi’s 12-year civil war ended and Hagabimana decided to return to help peacekeeping efforts with the United Nations.  A decade later, the country was gripped by protests opposing a third presidential term. Hagabimana, then a National Police officer, refused orders to suppress demonstrators and was jailed and beaten, he said.  Recalling a night in prison, he said: “I knew if they hit me on the head I would have been finished.”  While in jail, a lawyer friend in Athens launched an international campaign for his release. He returned to Athens in 2016, with the help of Greek authorities.  Hagabimana’s agenda is business-focused, but he also hopes to inspire migrants that “they can be equal members of society… and that everything I achieved, they can do more”.  The colour of his skin should not be the focus, he said.  “It is more important to me that I am a Greek citizen by choice.”  (Reporting by Karolina Tagaris; Editing by Alex Richardson)"

Buffett and longtime business partner Charlie Munger have shared their thoughts on what happened. However, at Berkshire Hathaway's 2023 annual meeting, Buffett offered a little more insight into Berkshire's decision on the world's largest contract chipmaker, and what he would be looking for in an alternative semiconductor stock.  Buffett says TSMC is like no other, but...  When asked (again) about selling Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC), Buffett reaffirmed that he likes the business -- a lot. In fact, Buffett said ""[TSMC] is one of the best-managed companies and important companies in the world,"" and that ""there's no one in the chip industry that's in [TSMC's] league, at least in my view.""  You could also make a very solid argument that TSMC stock was dirt cheap the summer and autumn of 2022, and still is, at less than 13 times trailing-12-month earnings. With the entire semiconductor industry expecting a rally in sales in the back half of 2023 and into 2024, TSMC's earnings could be headed higher as soon as this summer, which would make the stock even cheaper (assuming stock price stays the same). That also satisfies Buffett's buying a ""wonderful company at a fair price"" criteria.  So here's the catch: Buffett dislikes instability, and TSMC's location in Taiwan unsettles him. As I wrote a few months ago, it's possible that Buffett changed his mind after the U.S. CHIPS Act was passed last August. After that, the U.S. started dialing up its restrictions of advanced chips and chip manufacturing equipment to China. That, in turn, has led to rising China-U.S. tensions, as well as China's hints it might invade Taiwan to reunify it with mainland China.  Such an event would be disastrous for TSMC, not to mention the global economy and its reliance on the advanced chips TSMC makes.  What does Buffett want in a semiconductor stock?  Buffett said he wants to find that wonderful business in the semiconductor industry like TSMC, but he wants to ""find it in the United States.""  Currently, as Buffett stated, there currently isn't anyone who can operate with the same level of chip manufacturing or financial precision of TSMC -- in the U.S., or anywhere else. Perhaps Intel can pull off a coup and retake the manufacturing crown, but that will be a very expensive multiyear process, if it succeeds at all. At least as far as semiconductor manufacturers go, don't count on Buffett buying anything anytime soon.  But manufacturing is just one area of the chip industry. There are high-quality, dominant names based in the U.S. That said, fair values are tough to come by. There's no way Buffett and company are ever going to invest in an Nvidia or AMD. Charlie Munger has expressed his dislike of companies like this that have to reinvest lots of cash into new research and development to maintain their technological edge, rather than return most of that cash to shareholders.  However, the semiconductor manufacturing equipment makers are one corner of the chip industry that could fit all three of Buffett's metrics. Most of this space is dominated by just five companies:  These businesses have been around for decades and operate in an oligopoly. That means they face little in the way of competition, the entire semiconductor industry relies on their equipment to make chips, and they thus enjoy high rates of profitability.  Applied Materials especially fits the bill because it has the broadest range of tools covering all parts of the chipmaking process, it's valued reasonably (under 16 times trailing-12-month earnings), and it's based in the U.S. And it also pays a growing dividend and repurchases lots of stock.  This is just my opinion on a stock that would fit within Warren Buffett's framework. As it stands right now, Berkshire Hathaway is continuing its aversion to high tech, focusing instead on more industrial companies with well-entrenched business models. If Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing doesn't make the cut for Buffett, I'm not sure any other business in the space will either.  10 stocks we like better than Berkshire Hathaway  When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

He also suggested that Russia is entering a volatile period.  McFaul says that Ukraine's victory should be the restoration of the 1991 borders, which includes Crimea, and that any country that believes in sovereignty, democracy and opposing annexation should support those goals as well.  The former diplomat says that he believes the Biden administration should provide Ukraine with more weapons and faster. ""I most certainly believe that if Putin loses the war in Russia, it will undermine his political standing in Russia.""  McFaul agrees that hoping for Ukraine's victory to cause the Russian regime to collapse is wishful thinking. The goal of the U.S. and NATO should be to restore Ukraine's sovereignty, he finds. He also says that everybody would be better off if Ukraine was given security guarantees and the ability to defend itself against future attacks, suggesting that Ukraine should be able to join NATO eventually.  He harks back to when Estonia joined NATO and how everyone thought that would be destabilizing and anger the Russians. ""But look at what has happened as a result of that. Countries that are inside NATO have not been attacked. Countries that are outside NATO – Georgia is on my mind, Ukraine is on my mind – have been attacked. I think NATO expansion could be stabilizing for all countries.""  McFaul suggests there is plenty of disappointment with Putin among the economic and political elites of Russia, while it is too dangerous to express it now. ""But my prediction is that Putin will stay in power as long he is physically capable. I don't see a scenario where he is overthrown, that a general will lead a coup d'état. I think they're very unlikely.""  He adds that the day after Putin will be a volatile time in Russia. ""Because he will pick his successor, Putin 2.0, without question. But that person will not have the political support that Putin had. They won't have the history of having been in place when the Russian recovery recovered,"" McFaul says, adding that Putin had no hand in that and simply got lucky with his timing.  Talking about scenarios where Russia might become even worse after Putin or fall apart, McFaul says that maybe the leader after Putin might be more radical but they will be a transitionary figure. ""Secondly, the Russian state today is a lot stronger than it was in 1992. So the nightmare scenarios where criminal regimes will take over nuclear weapons – I think that is very unlikely."" He goes on to say that while there is a lot of corruption in Russia, influential criminal groups and private armies, they are all signs of weakness, as Putin would not need the Wagner mercenary group, would not need to hand down lengthy prison sentences [pointing to Vladimir Kara-Murza] if he was beloved and strong.

Small is also infamous for exacting aggressive retaliation efforts towards his perceived political enemies.  For example, Small led a political coup to have John Devlin removed from the Atlantic City Municipal Utilities Authority … in a move so outrageous that Atlantic City Council President George Tibbitt publicly called out Small, saying:  We were lied to by Mayor Small. We owe John Devlin a public apology.  Tibbitt then went on to issue a public apology for Devlin being unjustly removed from the Atlantic City Municipal Utilities Authority. Devlin was the board chairman of the time of ouster.  Devlin presently has a massive lawsuit working its way through the New Jersey court system against Marty Small, the City of Atlantic City and many other elected and appointed Atlantic City officials.  From the Believe it or Not files … tonight, Tuesday, May 16, 2023, political retaliation against Devlin has struck again.  The Atlantic City Board of Education has officially voted to remove Devlin from his duly elected Board of Education seat.  Devlin has now lost two public board seats at the hands of Small. It’s outrageous by any civilized norm.  Devlin is/was the Dean of the Atlantic City Board of Education.  Devlin has had an exemplary attendance record over the past two decades … many of those years serving as Board President.  Devlin has only missed two regular board meetings as of late. He missed one due to contracting COVID-19 and he missed a second regular board meeting because of a death in his family.  Devlin notified the Board Secretary in advance of missing these meetings.  There is a policy in New Jersey, that if a board member misses three unexcused meetings in a row, a board can consider removal proceedings.  It’s rarely done and it’s especially not considered when a board member has a legitimate reason for missing a meeting(s).  I have spoken with Devlin just after tonight’s adverse board action against him. As usual, he did not hold back.  ""They couldn't beat me in an election so they fabricated a frivolous reason to vote for my removal. I don't even know where to start … they even prevented me from seeking legal representation, I didn't even get due process.”  “This is a perfect definition of a whistleblower case … this was orchestrated by Shay Steele and his boss Marty Small.”  “This all stems from when I demanded an independent investigation into how a child molester living in The Marty and La’Quetta Small Home was allowed to work in our district. This matter is under litigation and I will assure you I will have my day in court,” said Devlin.  We published a letter recently hat was sent to Devlin that addressed his attendance … however, nothing about the letter would have indicated that they were prepared to move this swift against Devlin.  Heres the letter.  Harry Hurley, TSM. Harry Hurley, TSM. loading...  Harry Hurley, TSM. Harry Hurley, TSM. loading...  Devlin only received a few hours notice about the adverse action that the board was considering against him at tonight’s meeting.  He wanted to have his attorney with him … but, he could not do so on only a few hours notice.  Devlin does have the option of a formal appeal before the state board of education, regarding the action taken tonight by the Atlantic City Board of Education.  This appears to be an obvious case of political retaliation against Devlin, that will serve him well in his current lawsuit against the City of Atlantic City… As a continued example of political retaliation taken against him.  If this unjust move against Devlin is allowed to stand… It is a big loss for the taxpayers of Atlantic City… As Devlin was the only one on the school buses that was keeping checks and balances on both Marty and La’Quetta Small.  Devlin will be appearing on-air with us tomorrow morning, Wednesday, May 17, 2023 from 6:30 a.m. to 7:30 a.m. in his first interview since his removal from The Atlantic City Board of Education.

No other set of teams can claim meeting in three of the past four Conference Finals. No other set of teams has had the results swing in either direction – a necessity for a true rivalry – with Miami winning one series in six games and Boston winning the other in seven. Maybe the back and forth doesn’t extend into the pre-handcheck era, but you’d be hard pressed to find a matchup with more recent history – particularly when you consider the changing cast of characters over the years.  None of that really matters. It’s just a fun thing to consider before diving into the meat of a series, the reality of which should be stated clearly – Boston was the better team this season. By any measurement, they came out well ahead of a HEAT team that, by the same measurements, would likely be the worst to win a title (they had a negative points differential after all) in the three-point era, statistically speaking. The Celtics may not have been quite a dominant as they were in the second half of the previous season, but their league-leading Net Rating (+6.7) was close enough.  Boston is going to be favored. The projection systems are going to give them heavy odds. Journalists and analysts are going to pick them. It makes sense. The HEAT can win, undoubtedly, but picking them requires discarding much of what we saw during the regular season and choosing to believe in the smaller sample sizes, both in recent weeks and in toughness and resolve that shows up in the late, tight minutes.  The counter argument is that Miami was building something all season long, even if the results were never quite there. Erik Spoelstra saw what happened to his team’s offense against Boston last year, when the shooting fell off and Boston’s switching defense guided (pushed) them into quicksand, and decided changes were necessary in order to maximize their postseason potential. One of the beneficiaries of those changes broke his hand about a month ago, but otherwise it was Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo first and everything else built off of them – their matchup hunting, their scoring, their playmaking, their impact on the geography of the floor.  The offense cratered as the shooting couldn’t sustain the previous season’s results, but there was always a glimmer of something meaningful in the way the team was playing off of its stars. Meaningful in the sense that it would matter in the most important games, if they could just get back to them.  They got back there alright. It took 45 percent three-point shooting, Butler having one of the best series anyone has ever played and Giannis Antetokounmpo missing a few games – not to mention consecutive fourth-quarter double-digit comebacks – but they knocked off the No. 1 seed all the same. They thrived in the grind of the Knicks series, always looking like the better team despite Jalen Brunson’s most willful efforts. And now they have a chance to face the team which spurred many of their changes in the first place.  “We’ve had to find a lot of different solutions for a bunch of different coverages,” Spoelstra said. “That’s the most important thing. You let the game dictate. We still have to get to our main things. We’re aggressive but we also have to move the ball, that’s regardless of the scheme. Cycling through different challenges in some weird way has allowed us to wrap our minds around that.”  Any series against a team that switches a ton automatically becomes a Butler series. It’s a matter of fact, if not record. He’s the HEAT’s best isolation player, one of the best in the league, and you’re going to have to score one-on-one against switches. But now he’s got Adebayo, with his isolation usage pumped up all season, to help shoulder that burden. Al Horford is a brilliant defender – check what he did against Joel Embiid in the last round – who is both well acquainted with Adebayo and trusted by his team to defend him in single coverage, but Adebayo has a couple big games against him last year and averaged 25 against Boston this regular season. Even if the weight of this series isn’t on his shoulders, this is another opportunity, after facing Milwaukee’s drop coverage, to test the theory held season-long that he was building his postseason profile.  “His development has been built for, not specifically any team,” Spoelstra said of Adebayo. “It’s been all of these experiences we’ve had on these deep runs. You need to find different ways to get your best players impactful. There are different schemes. When you play against the Bucks, New York and Boston, it’s three different kinds of gameplans. It’s been 2-3 years of Bam’s iron will of player development. I’ve seen great improvement in his ability to be effective against different kinds of schemes and teams.”  Miami can win this series, they’ll just have to do it in ways they haven’t won with this postseason. Good thing their entire team identity has been finding different ways to win, whatever-it-takes-ing their way through every moment, every second.  WHAT THE STARTERS MEAN  One of the most relevant developments in this series happened in the last one. No, not against the New York Knicks. Against Philadelphia.  Trailing 3-2 and facing elimination on the road, Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla made the call to return to the starting frontcourt combination of Al Horford and Robert Williams. That’s the configuration that kickstarted one of the best defensive runs of the past two decades for Boston last year. But with Williams missing the first 29 games of this season and Boston opening the season at a historic offensive level, Mazzulla never returned to the two-big look for more than a handful of games.  Games 6 and 7 marked the first time in the postseason that Horford and Williams started together, having averaged just 5.2 minutes together in the previous 11 games. The 76ers proceeded to post Offensive Ratings of 89.6 and 95.7 as Boston kept Horford mostly attached to Joel Embiid in his pick-and-rolls with James Harden and brought Williams over from the weakside on any downhill attack.  Celtics Preview: Rob Williams Paint Help  That’s a tough look for any team to score on, even if Boston was essentially challenging Harden to score. With how much Miami has been reliant on Adebayo pick-and-rolls, it’s not hard to see how third-party rim protection could throw a wrench in the gears, especially with good wing defenders chasing the ball from behind – or attached at the hip – and Horford cutting off those dotted line catches for Adebayo just as he did Embiid’s nail opportunities.  Of course, that type of coverage is only possible because Boston was comfortable with Williams helping off P.J. Tucker and conceding that spray pass to the corner – just as they were last year leading to Tucker not being on the floor down the stretch of Game 7. And there’s the predicament at the dawn of this series. Coaches tend to stick with what has been working most recently until proven otherwise. Mazzulla has already stated, on Tuesday, that Williams will remain a starter. With Erik Spoelstra starting Kevin Love, can the Celtics be as effective as they’ve been with what might not only be their best defensive lineup, but their best overall lineup?  On paper, that’s a win for Miami. If the other team is going to help off a good shooter, you let that shooter try to punish the defense. But it’s never that simple. Williams, who is capable of some of the best three-point closeouts you’ve ever seen from a player his size, doesn’t have to concede the same shots to Love that he did Tucker. Boston can stay in rotation, sending an additional defender to the corner and filling in from there. They’re capable of that. Williams also doesn’t have to be assigned to Love in the first place. In Game 1 against Milwaukee this year, Giannis Antetokounmpo – wanting to play a similar free-safety role alongside Brook Lopez – was on Gabe Vincent with Miami otherwise starting two good shooters in Max Strus and Tyler Herro. Those plans went awry, of course, but it was their plan.  It might only take a few threes from Love to force an adjustment, but there are further layers to consider. Say Boston decides to go back to their spread, five-out lineup used for most of the regular season, with Derrick White – or Grant Williams, even, for maximum switchability – alongside the four regulars. That’s a group that stretches your defense out as well as any. They’ll test Love’s defense in space, whether he’s dropping back or showing out off of screens, in ways that neither Milwaukee nor New York could even dream of.  What if Miami adjusts first and moves someone like Caleb Martin into the starting lineup despite Spoelstra’s seeming resistance to doing so with how successful Martin has been with bench groups? The Celtics put Williams on Martin last year during the regular season and to Martin’s credit, he didn’t try to punish the coverage only with outside shots – though he will shoot if left open – and regularly drove the paint.  “Shooting the ball is going to be big for me especially if they’re going to have guys overhelping,” Martin said. “There are multiple ways I’m going to try and be effective and impactful if they’re going to put guys like that on me.”  There’s another layer to this that wasn’t exactly present last time around, namely that with Miami less focused on switching this year they’ve often thrived in this postseason the closer they can keep Adebayo to the rim. That was especially true against New York, when Mitchell Robinson’s presence, plus a decent dose of zone, meant Adebayo could hang around the paint and deter the attacks the Knicks were so dependent on. Boston’s stretch will make that more difficult, but at least with Williams – literally the only non-shooter in Boston’s rotation – in the game that makes it easier for Adebayo to be the same kind of help defender, and rim deterrent, that Williams is on the court to be.  It’s popular to say that starting lineups don’t matter, but with Boston essentially playing a two-big rotation, with Horford and Williams both playing the five, a two-big starting lineup is the cleanest way for them to get to that look. Miami has the personnel options to make it tougher on the Celtics to crowd the paint with length. Keep an eye on how this plays out over the first couple games. Maybe someone blinks first. Maybe nobody does. Maybe blinking isn’t even a battle lost in the long run.  HOW THE TURNTABLES…  There are some stats that you never forget. Even if the exact numbers escape you over time, the meaning behind them linger in the shallow recesses of the brain ready to be called upon whenever the right context presents itself.  For last year’s Eastern Conference Finals, it was all about the turnovers.  On all possessions which started off a defensive rebound or a live-ball turnover in that series, the HEAT scored a pristine 1.30 points per possession. But when they were playing off Celtics scores, either field-goals are free-throws, their efficiency dropped all the way down to 0.94. The effect for Boston was not nearly as dramatic, as they mustered 1.10 points per possessions playing off Miami scores. In other words, turnovers and stops were the source of everything good on offense for the HEAT, which is why there were so many dramatic, snowball runs over the course of those seven games. The Celtics averaged 12.3 turnovers in their four wins. They averaged 19.3 in three losses. Even this season, Boston’s 13.3 turnover percentage jumped up to 18.8 in four games against the HEAT.  The main culprits on Boston’s part were their highest usage players in Tatum and Brown, who combined for about eight turnovers a game, 10 in Boston’s losses. Many of those weren’t just any turnovers, setting illegal screens or offensive fouls or throwing the ball out of bounds. They were direct transferences of possession, often outside the paint, where Miami could quickly take the ball in the other direction. Miami had 21 pick-six possessions overall (turnovers becoming near-immediate transition scores) in the series.  Celtics Preview: Tatum/Brown Turnovers  These things did not happen by accident. Rather, they were a direct result of the intersection of occasionally brute-force attackers and a scheme that specifically shrinks those attacking lanes. In that area, Miami hasn’t changed at all. Whatever pick-and-roll coverage they’re in, they are going to bring extra limbs and bodies into the path of the ball.  “That’s where we find our strength on defense,” Strus says. “We’ll keep being the aggressor.”  The personnel is a bit different, though, and neither Brown nor Tatum have been quite as loose with the ball this year. Among the regular rotation guys in the previous series, Victor Oladipo – who appeared to have timed out Brown’s dribble and gather specifically – led all players with three steals per 100 possessions. P.J. Tucker was fourth in that category, behind Jimmy Butler and Kyle Lowry. What all those players have in common is that they have incredible hands, swiping and grabbing and making the act of turning a dribble into a shot as miserable an experience as possible. The HEAT still have good defenders in their spots – this might be a series for Haywood Highsmith for this exact reason, along with simple one-on-one defense – and Lowry and Butler will create their own brands of chaos, but it’s tough to replicate true First Team All-Hands Team guys.  Maybe this series is different. Maybe Miami doesn’t need to force turnovers this time around in order to produce consistent offense. Maybe they force them all the same, with different players doing the forcing. All we have to go on is past performances, and based on what we’ve seen, and what we know from watching the Celtics play just about anyone else over the past 18 months, the turnover column in the box score might be second in importance only to the one that tells you how well a team is shooting from three. It won’t be a panacea, but it factors into who Miami wants to be.  “We’re at our best when we’re disruptive, but we also feel like our offense has taken some strides,” Spoelstra said. “Against a really good team like Boston, you have to compete at a high level on both sides. It’s not as simple as we’re going to get stops or turn them over.”  DROP IT, SWITCH IT, BOP IT  It’s been a postseason of drop coverage for Miami. Between Brook Lopez and Mitchell Robinson – even with Robinson playing up higher and New York crowding the paint – there have been plenty of opportunities for HEAT ballhandlers to come off a screen and know a shot will be available to them. You could even make the argument that, aside from Butler entering the Konami Code on himself, the confidence Miami’s shooters had knowing where and when they could get shots was the primary driver of the team’s blistering offensive pace in that series.  Al Horford is going to drop, too, but the difference with Horford is that he’s not dropping because it’s Boston’s only scheme. It’s almost calculated, giving the offense a look that Horford can toggle out of whenever the need is there. Just look at Horford’s switch rate, per 100 possessions, by quarter this season:  First Quarter: 6.6 switches per 100  Second Quarter: 7.8 switches per 100  Third Quarter: 8.4 switches per 100  Fourth Quarter: 11.2 switches per 100  That’s not someone who switches because he has to. That’s intentional, saving the bulk of his switches for the moments where protecting the paint above all else, playing the math game, is less important than contesting every shot. The later in the game it gets, the less important your points per possession becomes as simply maximizing your chances of putting points on the board, even on shots of lesser value, is often what wins you games. In other words, you might catch the HEAT getting some solid looks against Horford’s drop early on, but chances are they’re going to have to beat late-game switches one way or another.  “They’re second in switches but that can also play a more traditional drop coverage, so you can’t just prepare for one thing,” Spoelstra said.  Williams, on the other hand, will be in drop most of the time. It’ll look more like New York than Milwaukee, generally speaking, with Williams able to adjust the depth of his positioning while also being a bit more mobile, a bit more quick-twitch than both Robinson and Lopez before him – meaning he can both contest shots while shadowing a ballhandler that might get a stop on him. When Miami needs to stabilize and get a look, this might be where to get it, though keep in mind Boston also has the capability of pre-switching Williams out of those actions as his man gets called up should Mazzulla see the coverage being exploited too often.  The switch is still the thing. Only Brooklyn switched more screens than Boston this season, and you could argue that nobody executes as creative, sophisticated switch schemes as this Celtics squad, just as capable of switching away from the ball as they are on it. Like the HEAT, they also haven’t been quite as good at it this year. A possession featuring a Boston switched screen during the 2021-22 season was expected to allow 0.87 points-per – bordering on silliness. This year it’s jumped back up to 0.96, elite but not historically so. They haven’t been as razor sharp as before, though we should consider that having their backs up against the wall against the 76ers could very well have revitalized said tool.  For all the gains Miami has made with their offense this year – we know what you’re thinking, but it was all reflected more in style and process than in results, with an eye on postseason basketball – they continued to struggle at times against switches, scoring just 0.97 points-per-switched-screen. The good news there is that Butler, considering switches often lead to isolations, produced 1.09 points-per-switch this season as a ballhandler.  Chances are that the HEAT’s offense is going to look stalled out at times. It’s an inescapable reality when you’re playing a switching team hitting their apex. But switching requires an incredible amount of individual ability and team-wide precision, which is why most teams don’t even attempt to switch at the volume Boston does, including Miami after a few roster changes. When it looks bad, the HEAT are going to have to weather the storm. Butler and Adebayo in particular are going to have to break them out of those rough patches with some hard-earned buckets.  But the Celtics of this year have not shown an ability to execute with the same consistency as a season ago. That’s where the HEAT are going to have to make hay, forcing Boston into situations where they either have to execute, two, three or four switches in a row, or – by stacking actions and screens – execute two, three or four switches at the same time. There are seams in there to attack, a defender a step slow to get in front of the ball or a miscommunication in the madness, and Miami is a team more than familiar with forcing teams into mistakes and then capitalizing on them.  In that sense it’s going to look bad for Boston sometimes, too, because if there’s anything this Miami team does well it’s make the other team look bad – even if it’s sometimes at the cost of making themselves look good.  DESERVES GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH IT  With all their shooters and scorers, rather with all their players who can both shoot and score, the Celtics can get a good look at a three just about any time they want. It’s an ability that can sometimes seduce a team as they lose sight of the paint, but it’s a dangerous ability nonetheless. Consistently running a true five-out lineup off the arc is one of the most difficult things to do in this league.  “When it comes to breaking down our half-court defense that we take so much pride in,” Love said, “we’re going to have to make four, five maybe six efforts at some point and some guys are going to be throwing their fists up saying, ‘Hey, I need a blow, I need a break.’ We’re going to have to go extremely hard to get these wins.”  Adds Lowry, “You can’t take away everything. You have to be to work an extra four seconds longer, or an extra three seconds harder or an extra rotation. We have to be on the same page and ready to go.”  Even if they’ve changed a bit from last year, Miami and Boston’s schemes aren’t so different. We’re once again going to learn the answer to the question of what happens when a team that takes a lot of threes going up against a defense which allows a ton of them. Difference is that Boston tends to get cleaner looks – the most catch-and-shoot opportunities in the league – and their Shot Quality (second best behind the Golden State Warriors) is going to routinely be better than Miami’s. There are going to be games in this series where it looks like Boston should be winning based on the differences in shots earned, but Miami might still be the team out in front through some combination of turnovers and offensive boards. Deserving to win doesn’t matter in the playoffs if you don’t actually win, and as the Bucks just learned sometimes a seven-game series is too short a time for percentages to normalize.  Miami’s win conditions in this series aren’t too complicated. They’ll need to force turnovers. They’ll need Boston to miss some good threes. They’ll need to capitalize against Boston’s early drop coverage just as they did against the Bucks. They need to win the possession game, ending up with more shots than their opponent. Their perimeter rotations and closeouts will have to be as good as they’ve been all season. And they need individual scoring efforts from Butler and Adebayo when the switching flattens them out and mucks up their movement actions.  But more than anything, they need to be who they’ve been. Not necessarily how they’ve played, but what this season has made them. Boston is supremely talented, but they have moments at the end of games where they take their foot off the gas. They leave the door open at times when it should be shut. This HEAT group, two games away from setting the record for games decided by five points or less in the regular season and postseason combined, is more than happy to kick doors down if they’re open even just a crack.  Maybe picking the HEAT in this series requires less schematic analysis and a couple more taps of the ‘Believe’ sign above the door. That’s fitting, because that’s what this team has been doing for the past month."

Some of the bullets flew through the windows of the house next door, where there were children. The attack, in which no one was injured, occurred in the Los Jazmines neighborhood in the city of Valdivia, some 850 kilometers (530 miles) south of Santiago, Chile. When Investigations Police (PDI) agents arrived at the scene, the attackers fled. One of the gang members, aged 15, threw a pistol into a backyard as he ran away. The following day, a resident called the police to report that he had found the gun on his property. It was a .380 Pietro Beretta, with a brown grip and a name embossed on it: Augusto Pinochet U.  After running the weapon’s serial number, the General Directorate of National Mobilization confirmed that the pistol was registered in the name of Augusto José Ramón Pinochet Ugarte, the former Chilean dictator who died in 2006. The system also showed that the gun had been reported as lost. The question authorities are now asking is: how did a pistol belonging to the general who staged the 1973 coup d’état find its way into the hands of a teenage member of a street gang in the south of the country?  The Pinochet family lost track of the gun a decade ago. In April 2014, Marco Antonio Pinochet Hiriart, the dictator’s son, reported the pistol missing at a police station in Lo Barnechea, in the province of Santiago, along with 17 other weapons including a rifle and several pistols and revolvers. There are around 770,000 registered firearms in Chile. Of those added to the registry over the last three years, at least 60% have been reported as lost or stolen, chief prosecutor of the North Central Metropolitan Region, Tania Sironvalle, said in an interview last November.  Pinochet's name engraved on the pistol grip. PDI Chile  Marco Antonio Pinochet noticed the missing weapons when he decided to make an inventory of his late father’s objects in what had been his residence during his final days, a property located in the municipality of Lo Barnechea, one of the most affluent areas of the Chilean capital. According to the police report, as quoted by the newspaper La Tercera, the fourth of the dictator’s five sons said “a large number of weapons of different brands and calibers were missing, and that they were duly registered with a collector’s description and one of them was defined as a weapon for personal defense.” According to sources familiar with the case, Marco Antonio told the police it was a case of “misappropriation.”  At the end of 2014, Lucía Hiriart, Pinochet’s widow, sold the mansion where the former dictator resided from 2000 following his return to Chile after being arrested in London. The following year, the new owners — who bought the home for $1.6 million — demolished the 1,500 square meter property to build a condominium.  Almost three months after the complaint lodged by Marco Antonio Pinochet, the Eastern Metropolitan Prosecutor’s Office ruled out investigating the case due to a lack of evidence. However, now that Pinochet’s Beretta pistol has resurfaced as part of a criminal investigation, the original case has been reopened. The Regional Prosecutor’s Office of Los Ríos, led by Juan Agustín Meléndez, has decided to separate the investigation of the attack on the house in Los Jazmines into two branches: one will deal with the two rival gangs of drug traffickers, in which 10 people have already been arrested, and the other will work toward solving the theft of Pinochet’s small personal armory in 2014.  The local prosecutor in Valdivia, Tatiana Esquivel, said that the 10 detainees in the gang case have been charged with attempted homicide, illegal possession of firearms and the unjustified discharge of weapons on public streets. Among the charges being brought against the 15-year-old gang member who discarded Pinochet’s pistol is illegal possession of firearms. On the night of the shooting, the teenager was also carrying a black bag containing 26 grams of cocaine and three shotgun cartridges. The PDI’s Anti-Narcotics and Organized Crime Squad arrested him almost a month after the attack, along with nine other members of his gang and a criminal organization known as Población Libertad, of which the son of the woman whose house was shot at was a member. He is currently in prison in Valdivia for drug-related crimes.  Sign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA Edition"

HARARE - Zimbabwe's upcoming presidential election and compensation of white farmers whose land was seized two decades ago are key to efforts to restructure its crippling debt, the African development bank chief said Monday.  African Development Bank (AfDB) president Akinwumi Adesina and Mozambique's ex-president Joaquim Chissano, are leading efforts to help Zimbabwe re-engage with the West to clear its $8.3 billion bilateral and multilateral debt.  ""The success of the efforts we have all put into this process will depend on what happens with the upcoming presidential elections,"" Adesina said at debt resolution talks with President Emmerson Mnangagwa in Harare.  He said the international community will be ""watching very closely"" the vote.  ""The full weight of re-engagement with the international community will depend on this... (and) the entire electoral process that guarantees a credible election"".  ""Success on the political and electoral reforms, and a free and fair election, are crucial to clear the pathway towards arrears clearance and debt resolution for Zimbabwe,"" he added.  Rights groups and opposition parties have complained of a clampdown ahead of elections, whose date is yet to be set.  Chissano, a respected statesman said holding ""free and fair elections"" and settling the issue of compensation for white former commercial farmers were among ""low-hanging fruits"" in advancing dialogue with the West and international financial institutions.  ""Harvesting these low-hanging fruits is critical as they are likely to trigger decisive action towards arrears clearance and debt resolution,"" he said.  Chissano and Adesina last week met members of the US Congress, State Department, Treasury among other agencies to discuss Zimbabwe.  Adesina revealed that the AfDB is working with Zimbabwe to develop ""innovative financial instruments and structures that can be used to front-load the mobilization of the $3.5 billion for compensations"", without getting into further debt.  ""It is important that we find a mechanism to try to fast-track...the payment of these compensations"".  Zimbabwe's late ex-president Robert Mugabe launched land reforms in 2000, grabbing white-owned farms to reverse a historical land ownership imbalance that favoured the white minority population.  More than 4,000 of Zimbabwe's 4,500 white commercial farmers were evicted from their properties, which were given to black tenants.  But in 2020 Mnangagwa, who succeeded Mugabe following a military-led coup, signed a $3.5 billion deal with dispossessed farmers to compensate them for infrastructure developments on their former land."

(MPVA)  South Korea is set to mark the 43rd anniversary of the 1980 pro-democracy uprising in the southwestern city of Gwangju later this week, the Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs said Wednesday.  Some 3,000 people are expected to gather at a national cemetery in Gwangju, 330 kilometers southwest of Seoul, on Thursday to commemorate the May 18 uprising, a watershed event for the country's democratization.  On May 18, 1980, demonstrators, including students, protested against the then ruling junta led by Chun Doo-hwan who seized power in a military coup the previous year. The military conducted a bloody crackdown on them, leaving hundreds dead.  Thursday's 45-minute-long ceremony will be held under the theme of sharing the ""spirit of May together with citizens"" -- a message meant to uphold the spirit of the Gwangju movement to safeguard the values of liberal democracy and human rights, according to the ministry.  It features a performance to console the bereaved families and a video clip of interviews with citizens highlighting their efforts to preserve the ""spirit of May"" and move forward to the future.  At the end of the ceremony, participants are to sing in unison the ""March for the Beloved,"" an iconic song representative of the nation's past struggle for consolidated democracy.  Whether to sing the song together used to be a controversial issue in the past as some right-wing politicians shunned it, in part because it was favored by their liberal rivals.

Each year, the Australia-based Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) produces Global Terrorism Index, or GTI, for 163 separate countries. The most recent GTI finds that, by the numbers, terrorism deaths dropped slightly during 2022. However, much of that “decline” is a result of the Taliban takeover in Afghanistan: since the Taliban is now the government, it isn’t included in GTI’s terrorist calculations.  But the index’s most eye-opening finding? The Sahel now accounts for 43 percent of the world’s terrorism deaths—more than South Asia and the MENA region combined. That percentage is on the rise. According to GTI, two Sahel countries—Mali and Burkina Faso—are among the world’s five countries most impacted by terrorism deaths. With 1,135 terrorism deaths in 2022, Burkina Faso now accounts for more terrorism deaths annually than any other country.  The Sahel is usually defined as the region in West and Central Africa with the Sahara to its north and the savanna to its south. The IEP includes parts of ten countries in their definition of the Sahel region: Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Gambia, Guinea, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, and Senegal.  So why is this region particularly vulnerable to terrorism? Many are quick to blame ethnic and religious conflict made more destructive by the growing availability of weapons from outside the region. But there are other contributing factors that are fueling deeper stressors and frustrations within and between communities. Weather extremes, unpredictable growing cycles, desertification, and diminishing arable land all contribute to the sense of declining economic opportunity that many feel—especially the region’s youth. Instead of using their authority to resolve disputes and build inter-communal understanding, many political leaders, armed with social media, appear all too ready to exploit these pressures for their own political gain. It’s also interesting to note that there have been six coup attempts in the region just since 2021.  All of these stressors open the door for violent extremists—including a number of deadly terrorist groups—to amass more power and gain more followers. Nowhere is that more true than the area where Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger come together. Here there is a growing presence of IS affiliates and Jamaat Nursat Al-Islam wal Muslimeen—a coalition of militant jihadists. But other violent groups, many not formally aligned with outside terrorist organizations, are engaging in crime and violence. An attack on Saturday, April 22, killed 10 people and wounded more than 60 when a bomb was detonated in the town of Sevare in Mali’s Mopti region. Less than two weeks earlier, the Burkina Faso villages of Kourakou and Tondobi near the Niger border, were attacked simultaneously killing 44 people.  With France’s withdrawal of its military forces from Mali last year, Russian mercenaries have seen an opening to increase their own presence and activities in the region. The Russian paramilitary organization Wagner Group is believed to be operating in Mali and Central African Republic. They are also suspected of operating—or soon to be—in Burkina Faso and Chad. And there are rumors of other outside groups taking advantage of the region’s weak governance and lack of western assistance.  During my time as the USAID administrator, our programs in the Sahel region were pointed toward building resilience, increasing constructive options and opportunities for individuals (especially youths), resolving conflict through tailored mediation and reconciliation programs, and promoting messages that affirm peace-and-stability to counter extremist propaganda. While military efforts to counter terrorism are important, it is also critical to work with local governments to increase their responsiveness to citizen needs and counter extremism through opportunity.

It was the 10-member bloc’s third summit since the February 2021 coup d’etat in Myanmar, which pushed the country into a prolonged state of violent conflict and economic decay.  It was also the third summit since ASEAN adopted the “Five-Point Consensus” and created a special envoy mechanism to resolve the crisis in Myanmar. In keeping with the bloc’s current policy, Myanmar’s seat at the 42nd summit remained vacant, with the Burmese junta disinvited to the high-level event.  Despite the policy of snubbing the junta, ASEAN has failed to implement the Five-Point Consensus. One could even argue it has allowed the consensus to fail. Myanmar’s obstinate generals continue to take the bloc for a ride by ignoring the consensus’ stipulations and setting their own terms, definitions, and timelines for its implementation. This obduracy hasn’t noticeably damaged the junta’s already-tarnished image, but it has certainly soured ASEAN’s reputation as a regional organization.  Meanwhile, the current ASEAN chair, Indonesia, has initiated a backdoor process that might potentially break the political and diplomatic ennui over the crisis. The exact contours of this shadow mechanism remain fuzzy, but in the current scheme of things, it certainly indicates forward movement of the glacier.

Can they find a resolution to the Myanmar imbroglio?  The ASEAN Way: A Broken Record?  In the latest ASEAN summit’s 25-page “Chairman’s Statement,” the Myanmar crisis triggered by the coup and the ASEAN’s Five-Point Consensus were mentioned in the very last point, below the Russia-Ukraine war. Beyond noting the recent completion of the Joint Needs Assessment (JNA) and “partial delivery” of humanitarian aid in Myanmar by the ASEAN Coordinating Center for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management (AHA Center), the bloc said nothing new on the crisis. It continues to hold the Five-Point Consensus as its “main reference point” on the issue, despite negligible progress on its implementation.  Advertisement  Save for the recent attack on an AHA aid convoy in eastern Shan State by an unidentified “militia,” ASEAN did not condemn nor mention any other violent incident in Myanmar in the final statement. In fact, the bloc condemned the convoy attack and called for the perpetrators to be held accountable in a separate statement on the very first day of the summit.  In the final statement, there was no mention of the devastating aerial bombing of a large civilian gathering in Sagaing Region’s Pazi Gyi village on April 11, which killed more than 175 people. Indonesia, as the bloc’s chair, had “strongly condemn[ed]” the attack in a statement released on behalf of the entire organization on April 13. However, ASEAN stuck to neutrally urging for “immediate cessation of all forms of violence” in the post-summit statement.  Notably, the bloc also did not highlight the junta’s failure in making any progress on the Five-Point Consensus, which it did in last year’s final statement. However, during the meeting, Indonesian President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo said that “there has not been significant progress” on the consensus’ implementation.  ASEAN appears to be locked in an endless and all but futile cycle of taking cognizance and issuing condemnation. In fact, its repetitive refrains on Myanmar have started to sound trite and unimaginative. This vagueness comes from two places – structural constraints on making hard interventions in Myanmar, and serious internal disagreements on how to deal with the junta.  By now, it is an open secret that ASEAN is divided over the latter. According to CNA correspondent, Leong Wai Kit, a “leaked memo” from the latest summit revealed that while some member states want ASEAN to re-include the junta at the highest levels, others, like Indonesia and Singapore, favor the current boycott policy.  This is hardly a surprise given that the bloc continues to employ a hybrid – some would say, indecisive – strategy of including and boycotting the junta. While the junta remains uninvited to the annual summits, its senior officials have participated in dozens of ASEAN meetings since the coup, including the ASEAN Defense Ministers’ Meetings (ADMM) in 2021 and 2022 and a meeting-cum-exercise of the ADMM-Plus in February. The junta was, however, excluded from the defense ministers’ annual retreat in November 2022.  Ultimately, ASEAN remains awkwardly stuck between censuring and entertaining the coup regime. This has generated widespread frustration and confusion in external quarters, including Myanmar’s revolutionary forces, who are aghast at ASEAN’s failure to hold the junta accountable for its brutality and foot-dragging.

Many of them might want to eventually deprioritize Myanmar and focus on other issues, such as the Indo-Pacific. As a result, Myanmar’s issue with ASEAN might slip into a state of comatose.  The Indonesian Way: A Breakthrough?  Earlier this month, Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi told Reuters that Jakarta had been “quietly engaging key stakeholders in Myanmar’s conflict, as well as neighbors India, Thailand and China in an effort to kick-start a peace process.” She revealed that Indonesian diplomats have had more than 60 “engagements” with parties involved in the Myanmar crisis, including the military junta, ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) and the civilian-led National Unity Government (NUG). Retno characterized Jakarta’s conflict mediation efforts as “non-megaphone diplomacy” designed to “build trust with all stakeholders.”  Advertisement  This came four months after Jakarta revealed that it would use its ASEAN chairmanship to set up a “special envoy’s office” in order to manage the bloc’s conflict diplomacy on the Myanmar crisis. The office was later set up with Retno as its head. Senior diplomats are playing a supporting role by conducting closed-door meetings with various stakeholders on her behalf, while a small coterie of administrative and logistical staff has been handling day-to-day operations.  It remains to be seen whether the office will be carried forward into next year, when Laos takes over from Indonesia as the ASEAN chair. Jakarta might want to remain active in the mediational efforts beyond its chairmanship. However, it has not yet fully institutionalized the office or resourced it to a level where it can become a concrete, ASEAN-level unit. This is a major concern, as the bloc’s rotating chairmanship has come in the way of ensuring continuity and consistency of intent and action on Myanmar.  Since the 2021 coup and the signing of the Five-Point Consensus two months later, this is the first time an ASEAN chair has done something beyond what is understood to be its standard remit on the Myanmar issue. In fact, Indonesia has demonstrated that with political willingness and diplomatic tenacity, progress is possible. Crisis diplomacy is delicate business, and Jakarta’s approach reaffirms the constructive possibility of going behind closed doors to build confidence and create trust where there is none.  Most importantly, unlike India and Thailand – who are known for their own “silent diplomacy” on Myanmar – Indonesia has engaged all sides, and not just the junta, in its shadow diplomacy. This may look like a radical move given the region’s conservative legacy, but is simply in line with the Five-Point Consensus.  Despite this, the closed format has its own downsides. Outside observers do not get to assess the outcomes of the talks. This means there is little to no public accountability. It becomes impossible to assess whether such a process is actually working, or if its outcomes align with the broader objectives enshrined in the Five-Point Consensus. So the risks of expecting too much from “the Indonesian way” are real. Jakarta may be trying its best to find a meaningful, people-centric solution to the crisis, but it remains hostage to more than one restraining factor.  One, Indonesia faces a serious normative dilemma over ASEAN’s non-interference principle, on which the jury is still very much out. On the one hand, Jakarta wants to be principled and seek accountability from a member that has grossly violated the ASEAN Charter. On the other, there is also a limit to what Indonesia can do to seek such accountability. Any wrong move might be seen as conferring legitimacy to one side in the conflict, which could instantly alienate the other sides. Further, fellow ASEAN countries could see Indonesia’s Myanmar diplomacy as idealistic unilateralism, which could then widen existing fissures within the bloc and eventually, dilute its centrality. This is a scenario that Jakarta would want to avoid at all cost.  Indonesia also remains apprehensive of the fact that the Myanmar imbroglio could hijack the entirety of the ASEAN agenda under its chairmanship. Jokowi, during the latest summit, said that the “issue of Myanmar must not hinder the acceleration of ASEAN community building because community building is awaited by the people of ASEAN.” Earlier, Teuku Faizasyah, the Indonesian Foreign Ministry’s director general of information and public diplomacy, in an op-ed for The Jakarta Post, argued against judging Indonesia’s ASEAN chairmanship “solely by the ongoing stalemate in Myanmar.”  Finally, Indonesia lacks the capacity to sustain a comprehensive mediational initiative that is backed by sufficient political willingness and resources. There is no doubt that the Foreign Ministry is keen on moving ahead. But, beyond the Rohingya crisis, the general Indonesian public does not yet see the Myanmar situation as a strategic impediment. This might disincentivize the Jokowi government from continuing to invest diplomatic capital in the crisis. Throw in the fact that Jokowi himself is term limited and will be replaced by a new president in 2024, and the longevity of the current effort is questionable.  A Third Pole?  Besides the collective ASEAN track and the distinctive “Indonesian way,” there is a third regional approach that has emerged regarding the Myanmar crisis. This Track 1.5 approach is primarily led by Thailand and India, Myanmar’ two influential neighbors to the east and west, respectively.  The latest meeting of this “third pole” took place on April 25 in New Delhi as a follow up to the first one hosted by the Thai government in Bangkok on March 13. The Indian government, along with the Indian Council on World Affairs (ICWA), hosted it. Government and think tank representatives from Thailand, Bangladesh, Laos, China, Vietnam, and the former and current ASEAN chairs, Cambodia and Indonesia, joined the Track 1.5. The hosts also invited “mid-level” junta representatives from Myanmar, but left the NUG out.  As per media reports, the participants discussed “reduction of violence, countering transnational crimes, national reconciliation, delivery of humanitarian aid” as well as “creating space for dialogue.” They also agreed to support “Myanmar’s capacity to fight transnational crimes,” indicating a desire to work with the junta on specific issues. According to a Nikkei Asia report, India “agreed with Myanmar to send a delegation to Naypyidaw to help push for a ‘full resumption of dialogue’ between the regional governments.”  Advertisement  Enjoying this article?

It is clear that this third track is designed to serve the interests of Myanmar’s immediate neighbors in South Asia and the Mekong region, who feel flustered by ASEAN’s vague approach. The overall tone and tenor of the discussions suggest that the hosts, instead of finding a solution that respects the wishes of the Myanmar people, only seek to normalize relations between the coup regime and regional governments, including with themselves.  Most of the states joining this effort see the Myanmar situation from a pragmatist-realist perspective, and have resumed normal diplomatic engagement with the junta over the last one year. They also have little track record in seeking accountability from autocratic military regimes. This creates a very narrow and instrumentalist pathway to conflict resolution that privileges geopolitics over justice and accountability. The meeting’s secretive nature also allows its participants to dodge public accountability, not unlike Jakarta’s own shadow diplomacy.  These are serious concerns that Indonesia, or any ASEAN chair, should take note of. Four months before New Delhi hosted the Track 1.5, Retno told The Hindu that India (and all ASEAN partners) should follow the Five-Point Consensus, instead of going their own way on Myanmar. But, contrary to claims made by its hosts, this process appears to be only negating, not complementing, the ASEAN consensus, which stipulates engagement with all stakeholders, and not just the junta. By drawing in only a select few ASEAN member states, further, the Track 1.5 risks widening the cracks within ASEAN.  Overall, there seems to be a clash of views and methods between Myanmar’s immediate neighbors, who seek short-term solutions as countries directly impacted by the conflict’s cross-border spillover, and the ASEAN perspective, which is more normative, although internally conflicted. Yet, even “distant” countries that have felt the ripple effects of the Myanmar situation – such as Indonesia, which has seen an expansion of Myanmar-linked transnational criminal networks – may gravitate toward short-term fixes instead of a comprehensive resolution. Hence, ASEAN needs to reconcile with its own abstractions and confusions before attributing its failures to external entities.  The ASEAN Five-Point Consensus approach, the Track 1.5 process, and Indonesia’s “silent diplomacy” will have critical implications on each other and ultimately, on the dire situation in Myanmar. They may complement each other if all three operate in tandem. But, if the processes unfold in silos, they may end up scuttling each other and doing more harm than good."

(AP Photo/Hassene Dridi, File)  A court has sentenced moderate Tunisian Islamist leader Rached Ghannouchi to a year in prison for allegedly referring to police officers as tyrants in what his party said early Tuesday amounted to a sham trial  TUNIS, Tunisia -- A court has sentenced moderate Tunisian Islamist leader Rached Ghannouchi to a year in prison for allegedly referring to police officers as tyrants in what his party said Tuesday amounted to a sham trial.  Ghannouchi, 81, founder of the Ennahdha party, has refused to be removed from his place of detention for questioning or to attend Monday’s trial, considering that the cases are “political settling of scores targeting opponents of the regime,” lawyer Samir Dilou, a former party leader, said in an interview with The Associated Press.  Ghannouchi, a former speaker of parliament, is the most prominent critic of Tunisian President Kais Saied. He has maintained that Saied’s move in 2021 to take all powers into his hands amounted to a coup d’etat.  Ghannouchi was detained in mid-April on the charge of plotting against the security of the state. He has been called in numerous times for questioning on various matters, but this was the first time he wasn't released.  Monday's case grew out of a complaint by a security union member claiming that Ghannouchi used the word “taghout,” or tyrant, while eulogizing a member of his party at a February 2022 funeral. According to a tweet by his daughter Soumaya, he said that the deceased ""did not fear poverty, ruler or tyrant.”  Ennahda condemned the decision to prosecute as “an unjust political ruling” and called for his immediate release.  Ghannouchi is also being investigated for what his party says is another case of twisting words — allegedly evoking the threat of civil war if Ennahdha and other opposition parties are excluded from the political scene.  His party said on its English-language account that Ghannouchi was charged with conspiracy against state security and ordered to remain in prison pending trial.  “Kais Saied is making a mockery of the judiciary, using it as a tool for political revenge and persecution,” his daughter tweeted.  About 20 other people, including the director of the respected radio Mosaique, Noureddine Bouttar, are currently detained on a variety of charges.  The crackdown on opponents comes amid growing social tensions and deepening economic troubles in Tunisia, the birthplace of the Arab Spring pro-democracy movement more than a decade ago."

According to Saw Nanda Hsue, a spokesperson for the Karen Human Rights Group (KHRG), in the two years following the military coup, people have witnessed a rise in arbitrary arrests, killings, and the destruction of their homes and property by the military.  ""Based on our records, we have observed an alarming increase in extrajudicial arrests, looting, and killings primarily during the period between 2022 and 2023. Particularly in areas such as Brigade 3, Brigade 6, and Brigade 5, there has been a significant occurrence of looting and destruction targeting the homes of local residents, especially those who are fleeing. They unlawfully enter people's homes, prioritizing the seizure of valuable possessions. Even worse they often resort to burning down their homes.”  KHRG also reports they are carrying out arrests and killings upon encountering people in the area. "" We have noticed a rise in incidents where the public is being arrested, tortured, and killed if they are spotted in any fighting zone. These occurrences are happening more frequently,” he said.  Saw Nanda Hsue further stated that the military forcibly displaced villagers from their homes, arrested them, and employed them as human shields. In addition, airstrikes and artillery shells were unleashed, resulting in the loss of numerous lives.  ""These acts blatantly disregard international humanitarian law and qualify as war crimes. Consequently, We urge the international community to intensify their efforts in implementing sanctions, particularly concerning the fuel supply with a specific focus on airstrikes. We also strongly advocate for the complete cessation of military and business cooperation, accompanied by the escalation of sanctions,"" said Saw Nanda Hsue.  KHRG has made a plea to the international community, urging them to cut off the supply of jet fuel to the Military Council.

The move is a coup for the PFL, whose previous marquee signings have included social media influencer Jake Paul — signed in January — and two-time Olympic Games judo gold medalist Kayla Harrison, who has fought 15 times for them since 2018 and twice won the company's lightweight tournament.  Ngannou will fight in the PFL's Super Fight division, a pay-per-view roster of fighters that gives 50% of event revenue to competitors and was co-founded by Paul, who has outspokenly criticised UFC pay and called for fighters to receive more money.  Part of the reason behind Ngannou's UFC departure was the 36-year-old's desire to compete in professional boxing, with the fighter known as 'The Predator' publicly agreeing in February 2023 to the terms set out by heavyweight boxing world champion Tyson Fury for a bout between the towering pair.  MORE: Follow Francis Ngannou in the PFL on DAZN  Francis Ngannou joins Professional Fighters League  Ngannou's next move has been the subject of significant conjecture during his hiatus since his most recent fight, when he defended the UFC belt he had originally won against Stipe Miocic in March 2021 by beating Ciryl Gane at UFC 270 in January 2022.  Now he will become part of the PFL's tournament format, which works in seasons as part of a knockout competition giving fighters the chance to reach a final with a prize of $1 million (£800,000) for the winners.  The PFL launched in 2018 and has continuously expanded, agreeing major deals with broadcasters including DAZN and ESPN and recently beginning its inaugural season in Europe.  Promotions including MMA organisations ONE Championship and Bellator MMA and Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship are thought to have tried to sign Ngannou, whose UFC deal expired in January 2023.

Ngannou will be given equity and chairmanship of PFL Africa, a ""priority market"" for the company and one of six new international leagues the PFL wants to introduce by 2026 to form what it is calling a Champions League of MMA.  He will be part of an advisory board representing fighter interests in a position harbouring parallels with the 'head of fighter advocacy' role handed to Paul.  The deal will be for two-to-three fights, guarantee a ""seven-figure"" purse per fight and a split of net event profits, and afford Ngannou a bonus or salary to serve as a PFL ambassador, according to Bloody Elbow, which also claimed he will have his own sponsors in the cage, no 'champion's clause' or other extensions.  PFL CEO Peter Murray called Ngannou ""the greatest heavyweight MMA fighter in the world"" and pledged support for the fighter's work with communities in Africa and around the world, including his charitable foundation.  ""You have to give a ton of credit to Francis,"" said Marquel Martin, the head of Ngannou's management company. ""Most fighters couldn't go through what he went through this past year.  ""He understands his value and has been extremely patient to get to this point. Now, not only is he the best heavyweight in the world, but he has a deal that is unmatched and will set him up for life.""  Francis Ngannou PFL move: What has the MMA star said?  Ngannou had teased that an announcement was imminent, causing some fans to speculate that one of the most popular MMA fighters in the world might be about to return to the UFC.  He has called his partnership with the PFL ""game-changing"" and described himself as ""very excited"" about the agreement. ""I believe in the PFL's 'fighter-first' culture and global vision, including developing the sport in Africa,"" he added.  Will Francis Ngannou fight Tyson Fury?  The PFL announced that Ngannou will not make his debut for the promotion until mid-2024, leaving the door open for the boxing match he wants in 2023.  One of the reported stipulations in the contract Ngannou has signed is that he will not be exclusively tied to fighting for the PFL.  After Tyson Fury knocked out Dillian Whyte in a boxing match at Wembley Stadium in April 2022, the Englishman was joined by Ngannou for a live TV interview in the ring, when they spoke jovially about a bout both have said they want to happen.  In another interview, Fury said he wants the fight to take place in a cage using Queensbury rules and 4oz gloves, with former world heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson as referee.  Ngannou responded on social media agreeing to all of those conditions, and reports have suggested their showdown is close to being finalised in what would be Ngannou's professional boxing debut.  Whether or not his opponent is Fury — a fighter known for his tendency to talk up huge fights that subsequently fall through — it looks likely that Ngannou will box before he appears for the PFL.  Ngannou next fight: Who could he face in the PFL?  PFL boss Donn Davis has said he wants the 2023 PFL season to be ""the road to Francis"". ""I want to see the heavyweight division fight it out,"" he told Aaron Bronsteter in January 2023.  ""Whoever wins the 2023 heavyweight division, challenge Francis at the end of this year or the beginning of next year.""  2022 heavyweight champion Ante Delija could be the man to face Ngannou if the Croat continues his winning streak in the next stage of the tournament in June 2023.  Delija had been due to fight Gane in the UFC in 2020. The fight was cancelled because of a contract dispute between the PFL and Delija, ESPN reported.  Why did Francis Ngannou leave UFC?  Ngannou had repeatedly said that he did not feel the terms the UFC offered to him and its wider roster of fighters were sufficient.  A three-fight deal had been discussed between Ngannou and the UFC, with a reported offer to fight fellow heavyweight great Jon Jones in return for $8m.  Bloody Elbow said that Ngannou would ""very likely"" have earned more money than he will with the PFL had he stayed with the UFC and not lost his title within his next three fights.  MORE: History of boxing vs MMA: How Mayweather, Shields and UFC stars have fared  However, his PFL deal will handsomely reimburse Ngannou and address the issues he was unhappy about, including a one-year exclusive negotiating window and matching rights clause following the expiry of any contract. He also wanted in-cage sponsorships and health insurance for fighters.  UFC president Dana White said the company had allowed Ngannou to leave, claiming their former fighter ""doesn't want to take a lot of risks"" and ""feels he's in a good position where he can fight lesser opponents and make more money"".  ""In that contract, I'm not free,"" Ngannou told Ariel Helwani about the terms he said he had been offered. ""In that contract, I'm not an independent contractor.  ""In that contract, I have no rights, I have no power. I hand over all the power to you guys [UFC], and I've seen in the past how you can utilise that power.  ""How about those guys at the bottom? They can't really afford that health insurance. I have been there, so it's something I still carry in my heart.  ""I need some respect. I need some freedom. I need to feel like a man.

The self-exiled tycoon, a towering figure in Thai politics whose family is the driving force behind the dominant Pheu Thai party, said Move Forward proved social media and user-generated content (UGC) can triumph over big-spending campaigns and vote-buying.  Before Sunday's vote, Thaksin's populist political juggernaut had won every election since 2001, despite being ousted from office three times. It lost to the progressive Move Forward by 10 seats.  ""They used UGC on TikTok because the youngsters use TikTok. It's getting votes and canvassers organically and you don't use a lot of resources,"" Thaksin said during a two-hour political discussion streamed online.  Move Forward had strong appeal and organisation in university towns, Thaksin said, adding many young people convinced their parents to vote for Move Forward.  ""Pheu Thai got hammered because we did not disrupt ourselves enough. Move Forward's trend overcame Pheu Thai and the other parties that had money,"" he said.  Move Forward rode a wave of excitement among the youth generated by its liberal agenda and promises of bold change, including tackling monopolies and amending a law that prescribes long jail sentences for insulting the monarchy, a taboo issue.  Pheu Thai has agreed to form a six-party alliance with Move Forward, hoping more will join to keep the defeated pro-military parties out of government in the coup-prone country.  'WHATEVER WILL BE'  Thaksin wields significant influence despite being in exile for 17 years to avoid a jail sentence for abuse of power, which he denies. He reiterated his plan to return to Thailand in July and asked about prison said: ""whatever will be, will be.""  Thaksin also pledged loyalty to the palace and stressed Pheu Thai would not back any actions by Move Forward that would impact the monarchy.  Move Forward and Pheu Thai trounced parties backed by the royalist military, two of those led by former army chiefs involved in coups against Thaksin and the government of sister Yingluck Shinawatra.  Thaksin dismissed speculation of a secret deal with one of those generals to form a government, calling it an attempt to discredit Pheu Thai using online trolls.  He said Move Forward even won support in districts with large concentrations of rank-and-file soldiers, highlighting a generational differences over the military's political role.  ""For the two uncles, it should be enough is enough,"" he said, referring to the generals. ""Hanging up your gloves has dignity,"" he added.  ""It's a wake up call for the army. Using excessive power is something Thai society rejects. So it added to Move Forward's currency.""

The report, which analyzes the status of religious freedom in every country, is published annually and is an important tool to increase understanding of persecution in its many forms worldwide.  At the release of the report, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken stated, “We defend the right to believe or to not believe, not only because it’s the right thing to do, but also because of the extraordinary good that people of faith can do in our societies and around the world to promote peace, to care for the sick, to protect our planet, to expand opportunity for underserved communities, and so much more.”  The State Department noted that some countries showed improvement in religious freedom in 2022, including Brazil, which passed legislation making it a crime to carry out discriminatory acts on religious practices. Lawmakers in Brazil also codified religious freedom protections for followers of Afro-Brazilian religions, which are minority religious groups who have historically faced discrimination for their beliefs in the country.  And in the Central African Republic, authorities continued to prosecute cases of religious-based violence and other human rights violations against civilians following the military coup in 2003. In July, Idriss Ibrahim Khalil was arrested for his war crimes which led to the killing of multiple civilians, including a massacre in 2018 that left over 100 Christians dead.  Among the isolated cases of improvement, however, is a global trend that speaks to the deteriorating situation for religious minorities around the world. For example, the IRF report raised deep concern for the situation in Iran, where the government routinely convicted and executed protestors on charges of spreading anti-Islamic propaganda. Reports show that these prisoners were given punishments, including amputations, flogging, solitary confinement, and the death penalty.  In Nicaragua, the Catholic church faced government and societal discrimination, including arbitrary arrests, withholding tax exemptions, death threats, and unlawful entry. The anti-Catholic sentiment was further pushed by President Daniel Ortega, who called for the arrest of priests and bishops across the country, labeling them as “criminals” and “coup-plotters.”  And in Nigeria, the report highlighted the ongoing violence against Muslims and Christians, particularly in the northern region. Terrorist groups, militant herdsmen, and criminal gangs continue to target and attack religious minorities, all while the Nigerian government turns a blind eye to their suffering.  In November 2021, the State Department removed Nigeria’s Country of Particular Concern (CPC) designation, a move that drew widespread and continued criticism from human rights watchdogs. CPC designations are assigned to countries that engage in “systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom.”  Under the International Religious Freedom Act (IRFA), the President has 90 days following the release of the IRF Report to issue these designations.

The attack was one of Russia’s largest aerial assaults since March: Ukraine said Russia had fired an “exceptional” blitz of missiles and drones at Kyiv, but that it had shot all the Kinzhals down. Russia said one missile had hit an American-made Patriot system.

These would seem to be bad weeks for President Vladimir Putin.  Already, the Russian military has been forced into multiple retreats, and since last year has been mostly stalled along the 600-mile front line.

President AMLO said that there was a consensus between Mexico, Colombia and Chile not to give the presidency of the alliance to Peru.  “There are four countries [in the bloc]: Colombia, Chile, Mexico and Peru. And the opinion of the president of Colombia is similar to mine and the president of Chile. He is [also] not interested in giving Peru the presidency of this group called the Pacific Alliance… We can hand it over to Chile, to Colombia and let them decide what they [want to] do, but this lady, with all due respect, [is] a usurper, [who] expelled our ambassador from Peru,” said AMLO in response to a journalist’s question during his daily morning press conference.  President AMLO reiterated that the former Peruvian President Pedro Castillo was unjustly imprisoned because he came from a humble background and he did not allow the conservative forces to plunder his country as they are doing today. In this regard, he suggested that Boluarte leave the presidency to Castillo, who obtained a legitimate victory in free elections.  “I suggest that she resign from the presidency because she is usurping that position and that she gets Pedro Castillo out of jail, a humble person, a teacher from the mountains of Peru and unfortunately in that country as in others racism and classism prevail,” said AMLO.  AMLO once again insisted that he cannot hand over the presidency of the Pacific Alliance to Boluarte because “for us, she is not legally and legitimately the president of Peru.”  Last month, on April 25, the Boluarte government requested the AMLO administration for the transfer of the pro tempore presidency of the trade bloc for the second time since December 2022. Through an official communique, sent to the foreign ministries of Mexico, Colombia and Chile, the Boluarte government demanded respect for Peru’s right to assume the rotating presidency of the bloc “without further delay” and said that “Mexico’s refusal breaches international obligations that affect the prestige of the alliance.”  Boluarte took office on December 7, 2022, after Castillo was removed by the right-wing dominated Congress in a legislative coup, and was subsequently arrested for having tried to dissolve the Congress by decree.  Following Castillo’s forcible removal and illegal arrest, hundreds of thousands of people, mainly from the long-neglected and marginalized countryside of Peru who identify themselves with Castillo, mobilized in different parts of the country. The protesters condemned Boluarte for betraying the progressive ticket she was elected on after she entered into a political alliance with the country’s right-wing forces. They demanded Castillo’s immediate release, Boluarte’s resignation, new elections, and a new constitution.  The Boluarte government unleashed brutal police and military repression against those who took to the streets against her government. According to reports from local media and human rights organizations, around 70 people have been killed in the protests, most of them in violent repression by state security forces.  On May 3, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) confirmed its report that 57 people died in these protests, and said that the state’s response to demonstrators was characterized by the “disproportionate, indiscriminate and lethal use of force.” It added that in some cases, the actions could be classified as “extrajudicial executions” and “massacres.”  Various Latin American political leaders have criticized the Boluarte government for violating Castillo’s political rights as well as the human rights of thousands of Peruvians who demanded her resignation. Mexico President AMLO, Colombian President Gustavo Petro, Chilean President Gabriel Boric, Honduran President Xiomara Castro, and Bolivian President Luis Arce are among those who have explicitly expressed support for Castillo and repeatedly called on Peruvian authorities to respect human rights and not to repress the people.  In the past months, the Boluarte government also announced the definitive withdrawal of the Peruvian ambassadors to Honduras, Mexico and Colombia. Peru has been maintaining bilateral relations with the countries through the chargé d’affaires. Additionally, in January and February, the Peruvian Congress also declared former Bolivian President Evo Morales and Colombian President Petro, respectively, a ‘persona non grata’ and prohibited them from entering Peru, due to their comments rejecting the coup against Castillo.  According to a recent survey conducted by the IPSOS Peru, 75% of the Peruvian citizens disapprove of the Boluarte administration, 79% reject the performance of the Congress, 68% are dissatisfied with the Judiciary, and 57% are displeased with the work of the Prosecutor’s Office."

In our part of the world, the military has played a significant — some might say an indispensable — role in the polity, society and even economy of quite a few countries. In Indonesia, the military under Suharto seized power from its founding father Sukarno and proceeded to rule the country until almost the end of the last century when the country transitioned into a more functioning democracy. Even today, the strong military presence is palpable across Indonesia, although some might say it could become a crucial counterbalance against the impending ""green wave,"" a broad movement of religiously inspired political activism. In Myanmar, the military has been running the country under various juntas since almost the earliest days of independence. The latest military coup happened but two years ago, ruthlessly ending a decade of democratic experiment and reimposing repressive rule by military strongmen. The international community appears to be helpless in resolving the enigmatic, multifaceted Myanmar crisis.  Then there is Thailand. The country distinguished itself in being the only country in Southeast Asia not to have been ruled by colonial powers. And that was perhaps why its military has also entrenched itself in all aspects of Thai society, not least in politics. Successive democratically elected Thai governments were often toppled by the powerful military as soon as the latter subjectively saw the former as being deleterious to national interest, which is often self-servingly interpreted as its interest. In this century alone, democratically elected Prime Minister Thaksin Sinawatra was deposed by the military in 2006, and eight years later, his similarly democratically elected sister Yingluck Sinawatra was similarly stripped of her premiership by the military.  The Thai military's coup playbook is remarkably consistent, although sometimes accidental — to the military mind — results which the military would ""rectify,"" sooner or later. Typically, the relationship between a Thai government with genuine popular mandate that is pushing some reforms with which the military is displeased would see its working relationship with the omnipotent military sour to the point of no return. Then the long-standing or even newly appointed military chief would launch a coup with his brother generals, sweeping the civilian leaders aside. Then after a number of years of outright military rule, the military would supposedly cede power to a civilian government if it's to its liking, sometimes with the same generals shedding their uniforms in favor of suits, with the vested interest of the military having been well-preserved or even enhanced. But sometimes, the supposedly well-controlled electoral results could go awry, and a genuinely popular civilian government is elected. Then the whole vicious cycle would repeat itself.  To forestall the ""unexpected"" and thus unfavorable results, the latest Thai ruling junta crafted a constitution which almost guarantees their continued hold on, or at least their participation in, future Thai governments. A wholly military-appointed Senate was created in addition to the popularly elected lower house of parliament, with the number of senators equal to half the number of lower house members. And then the military gets creative. Thailand is supposedly a parliamentary democracy, and in most other such jurisdictions, the lower house member who commands a majority of other lower house members' support would be appointed prime minister and form the next government. But the new Thai military-inspired constitution curiously provides that the successful prime ministerial candidate must command the majority of the total number of senators and lower house members. As such, unless the democratic opposition wins well over three quarters of the lower house seats, it cannot form a new government, and must work with, or even cede leading power to, the militarily connected parties.  Get the latest news  delivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times’ daily newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy  So, in the latest round of Thai elections over the weekend, a new youth-led party, Moving Forward Party (MVP), unexpectedly won the most number of lower house seats, trumping the popular Sinawatras' populist Pheu Thai party. The military political elite appeared to be momentarily split in recent months, and the two militarily connected parties garnered only the fourth and fifth most number of seats. Despite its second-best electoral showing, Pheu Thai conceded defeat to MVP, but even the combined seats won by these two major parties cannot reach the three-quarters needed to take the premiership. MVP's young and charismatic leader, Pita Limjaroenrat, was educated in the best Western universities, and in a sense brings a breath of fresh political air to Thai politics, wishfully away — from many voters' perspective — from both the military and the Shinawatras. But Pita could possibly clinch the premiership if he is able to round up not only Pheu Thai, but also a plethora of minor parties with lower house seats, to support him and together to form a new civilian government.  But an MVP-led Thai government may again not be in the good graces of the military, especially when the military is not a part of the ruling coalition. MVP put out as its main electoral appeal the ""Three D's"" of demilitarization, demonopolization and decentralization to restore Thai democracy. MVP also promised to end military conscription. All these measures, if really proposed, would no doubt irk the Thai military, and if its previous patterns persist, another coup can almost be expected in the months to come. Such is the relentless fate of modern Thai politics, with heavy-handed military intervention always at the back of the civilian leaders' minds.  Across the globe, as Turkey looks set to enter the second round of its presidential election, a discussion of its implications, not the least to this part of the world, will also come in due course."

Former paramilitary leader Salvatore Mancuso made the revelations during his testimony to Colombia’s Special Jurisdiction for Peace on Thursday.  “At one point a Venezuelan general came along with his son and some Venezuelan politicians to propose Carlos Castaño and I [...] that we carry out a coup d'état with a part of the Venezuelan Armed Forces allied with us to overthrow and assassinate Hugo Chávez,” Mancuso told the tribunal.  Mancuso, together with Carlos Castaño, led the the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC by its Spanish acronym), a former paramilitary group with ties to the Colombian Armed Forces that fought the country’s guerrilla armies, waging a violent campaign in the countryside that claimed thousands of victims.  The paramilitary chief was testifying before the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP by its Spanish acronym), a tribunal established as part of a peace agreement between the Colombian state and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) in 2016. Mancuso delivered his testimony via video from a prison inside the United States after being extradited in 2008 to face drug trafficking charges.  Mancuso, who seeks to return to Colombia, faces a long series of serious charges related to his time as a leader of the AUC. People involved in the country’s decades-long armed conflict who participate in JEP tribunals are eligible to receive special consideration, including reduced sentences, if their testimony is found to be truthful.  The work of the Special Jurisdiction for Peace has grown in prominence as Colombian President Gustavo Petro seeks to implement what his government has termed “Total Peace” in the country after his conservative predecessor deliberately sidelined peace efforts. The AUC itself formally demobilized between 2003 and 2006 as part of a separate deal promoted by former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe, which was criticized for being too accommodating to the paramilitary groups and leaders.  In his testimony to the JEP, Mancuso added that Castaño rejected the Venezuelan opposition proposal but nonetheless offered to send AUC troops to train their Venezuelan counterparts to carry out the coup. In 2004, a group of 50 Colombian paramilitaries was caught in an estate outside Caracas with an alleged plot to assassinate Chávez, who was elected in 1998 and served as president until his death from cancer in 2013.  Mancuso’s claim bolsters accusations of collaboration and coordination between Venezuela’s hardline opposition and paramilitary groups on both sides of the border. Self-proclaimed former “interim president” Juan Guaidó and his allies faced heavy criticism after photos emerged of the opposition figure embracing high ranking members of Colombia’s Los Rastrojos after he crossed from Venezuela into Colombia to participate in US-led effort to force “humanitarian aid” across the border in 2019.  Former US National Security Advisor John Bolton later revealed that the so-called aid scheme was indeed an effort to try to embarrass Maduro and trigger a break in the armed forces, as Venezuelan government officials had denounced.  Guaidó again illegally entered Colombia last month as part of an effort to sabotage an international conference on Venezuela hosted by Petro. It was not clear if he relied on the help of armed actors in the border region once more. Guaidó eventually fled Colombia for Miami and subsequently held meetings with US politicians from both sides of the aisle who reiterated their support for him and Venezuela’s hardline opposition.  Petro has similarly denounced a coup plot by former Colombian security officials, mercenaries and paramilitary outfits. Retired state security officials and reservists staged a protest against the Colombian president’s security policies last Wednesday, with some openly calling for his ouster. Human rights activists in Colombia have long denounced the closeness between Colombian state security forces and paramilitary outfits.  Colombian mercenaries are also accused of involvement in the 2021 assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moïse, with 18 Colombians, many of them former soldiers, having been arrested in connection with Moïse’s killing. The assassination is suspected of being organized with the help of a Florida-based security firm.  In 2020, Venezuela foiled an effort by a 60-man paramilitary force organized by US special operations veteran Jordan Goudreau and retired Venezuelan Major General Cliver Alcalá to infiltrate the country via Colombia with the aim of assassinating Maduro.  The plot, known as “Operation Gideon”, counted on the support and blessing of high-profile Venezuelan opposition figures, despite denials from Guaidó. Goudreau has produced evidence showing the opposition hired his Florida-based security company Silvercorp and has sued anti-government operators for breach of contract.  Mancuso additionally testified that the AUC buried at least 200 bodies in mass graves inside Venezuelan territory in the early 2000s. The former paramilitary chief said that practice emerged after communities inside Colombia started to speak out against the incineration of victims in crematoriums as part of an effort to disappear bodies. Following Mancuso’s claims, Colombia and Venezuela announced that the two countries had agreed to “immediately” work together to help find the remains.  Edited by Ricardo Vaz in Caracas."

He spent over an hour of prime-time television before an adoring crowd — courtesy of CNN — suggesting America should default on its debts (the crowd applauded) and that we should not defend Ukraine from Russia (cheers).  He defended his infamous “grab ’em by the pussy” comments, and called E. Jean Carroll, against whom a Manhattan jury had just found him liable for sexual abuse and defamation, a “whack job” and said her trial was “a rigged deal” (cheers and applause).  All of this was bad enough.  But what really got my attention was his attempt to rewrite the history of his attempted coup: He asserted that Jan. 6, 2021 was “a beautiful day” (more cheers), that the Capitol rioters had “love in their heart,” and that if elected, he’d pardon those who have been convicted (big applause). He denied moderator Kaitlan Collins’ factual assertion that he took three hours to tell the Jan. 6 rioters to go home (more cheers).  He claimed that he never asked Georgia election officials to “find” him the exact number of votes needed to defeat Biden in Georgia. (He did, and it’s on tape.) He claimed that ex-Vice President Mike Pence had the power to overturn the election. (He didn’t.) He called Michael Byrd — the Black Capitol Police lieutenant who fatally shot Ashli Babbitt while protecting lawmakers during the storming of the Capitol — a “thug.” (He isn’t.)  And he reiterated that the 2020 election was stolen from him, and — menacingly — refused to commit to the results of the 2024 presidential election (more applause).  What’s been the reaction to this prime-time squalor?  No Republican lawmaker has condemned it — except for Utah’s Mitt Romney (remember him? He was the Republican Party’s presidential nominee in 2012, as amazing as that now seems).  From the rest of the Republican Party — Speaker Kevin McCarthy, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, other Republican leaders in Congress, Republican governors? Nothing.  What about Democratic lawmakers?  Besides questioning CNN’s judgment in giving Trump the platform, remarkably little.  My sources in the Biden administration say they were “delighted” with the CNN event because it gave Biden even “more ammo” against Trump and will “drive more Dems and independents to the polls to vote for Biden next year.”  Maybe. But what if it convinced more Americans of Trump’s lies? Of his “strength?” Of his baseless convictions?  CNN has gone into overdrive defending itself (and its CEO, Chris Licht) for giving Trump the platform. After all, said CNN repeatedly, Trump is the leading Republican in the race for president and the public has a right to see and hear him. Others in the media claimed it would be irresponsible to “ignore” Trump and “keep him under a bushel basket.”  As if that were the issue.  The issue was CNN’s decision to give Trump exactly what he wanted — more than an hour by himself, with a hand-picked audience, and a single reporter who couldn’t possibly correct his torrent of lies (after Kaitlan Collins repeatedly asked him about his handling of classified documents, he called her a “nasty person,” eliciting audience cheers).  But the problem we face is larger than the silence of Republican lawmakers, the smug tactical response of Democrats, and the blinkered defense of CNN by the media.  Two and a half years after Trump summoned supporters to Washington, rallied them outside the White House, and, knowing they were armed and dangerous, sent them to “stop the steal” on Capitol Hill — where they rioted, threatened the lives of Congress, and caused five deaths — he has still not been held legally accountable.  Yes, he has been found liable in a civil trial for sexually harassing and defaming one woman and indicted for making hush-money payments to another.  But he instigated an attempted coup of the United States in plain sight. Where is the Attorney General? The Special Counsel? The law?  Silence.  Wake up, America!  We are no longer dealing with politics as we have come to understand it — as I have seen and practiced it over the last half century: Democrats versus Republicans, liberals versus conservatives, left versus right. In this old form of politics, compromise was expected and often necessary.  It is now democracy versus authoritarianism.  There can be no compromise. And there must not be silence.  In 2016, Trump was a joke. He is no longer a joke. He has taken over the Republican Party, turning it into an anti-democracy party containing many officials who have bought into and magnified his big lie about winning the 2020 election.  Those who stood up to Trump have now been purged. Most Republican lawmakers who remain have made it clear that they will bend or disregard any rule that gets in their way.  Trump’s racism, sexism, homophobia, and xenophobia have fueled a dramatic rise in hate crimes across America.  His grievances and calls for vengeance are causing the nation to become ever more bitterly divided, paranoid, and suspicious.  He is less constrained than he was before. His lies are even larger. He is even more self-assured in telling them.  His rhetoric is even more menacing. “In 2016, I declared I am your voice,” Trump said at the recent Conservative Political Action Conference. “Today, I add: I am your warrior. I am your justice. And for those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution.”  Yet if the tepid silence from the rest of America continues, he has a fair shot at becoming president again in 2024.  Friends, we do not have the luxury of waiting 18 months until the 2024 election. The danger is now.  We must speak out against Trumpian fascism.  Demand that Trump be held fully accountable for what he has done.  Condemn the media for allowing him to set the terms for appearing, and for magnifying and legitimizing his lies.  Urge secretaries of state and other state election officials to refuse to put him on the ballot — under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which bars anyone from holding office who, having taken an oath to support the Constitution, has engaged in an insurrection against the United States.  And we must make good trouble, as John Lewis put it: Mobilize to protect equal rights and preserve the rule of law. Call out haters and bigots. Take to the streets, if necessary, to defend our democracy."

The Red Devils are said to be keen admirers of Kim, who has turned plenty of heads with his impressive form in Italy to help Napoli clinch the Serie A title for the first time since 1990.  Kim is thought to have been earmarked as the player United want to become their first summer signing when the bidding opens later this year, with Erik ten Hag eager to strengthen his defensive ranks by activating the South Korea international's £52million release clause. It seems as though Arsenal could also be set to benefit from the move if it goes ahead over the coming weeks, with LondonWorld reporting that Napoli have identified former Gunners defender Konstantinos Mavropanos as Kim's long-term replacement.    It is claimed that Mavropanos has already been 'lined up' by Napoli in advance of next season, although his current focus will be to help preserve Stuttgart's status in the Bundesliga as they battle to avoid relegation to Germany's second tier. They only signed Mavropanos on a permanent basis last summer following two season-long loan spells at the club but could be poised to lose him in the not-too-distant future if Napoli manage to tempt them with a suitable offer before the new campaign gets underway.    Stuttgart are believed to value Mavropanos at around £25m, which would see Arsenal pick up a chunk of any transfer fee given the presence of a sell-on clause that was inserted into the deal which saw him join the Bundesliga strugglers nearly a year ago. The move would also pave the way for Kim to join United, which would get the Red Devils off to a promising start in terms of their summer recruitment drive before the Premier League resumes in August. JUST IN: Six stars that won Premier League and got relegated as Jamie Vardy could be next  Arsenal could reportedly be set to benefit from United's first bit of summer business  It had recently been claimed that Napoli were willing to enter into talks with Kim over a new and improved contract in Italy, but everything now appears to be pointing to an exit at the end of the season in order for him to pursue a new challenge in the Premier League. It remains to be seen whether United will be able to win the race for his signature in the not-too-distant future, with Liverpool and Tottenham having also been linked, although they are seemingly in pole position to snap him up ahead of their divisional rivals as things stand.    The 26-year-old was recently given the ultimate compliment by Napoli boss Luciano Spalletti, who labelled him the best defender on the planet and underlined his impressive physical qualities after their victory over Atalanta in Serie A back in March. He told DAZN: ""Kim does at least 20 incredible things per game. For me, he truly is the best centre-back in the world. When he starts to run, he can get into the opposition penalty area in five seconds flat.""  Konstantinos Mavropanos is said to have been lined up as Kim Min-jae's long-term replacement"

Ibrahim Babangida (retd.) in 1990.  Orkar, who hailed from Benue State, and his conspirators seized the FRCN radio station, various military posts around Lagos and the Dodan Barracks, Lagos, the military headquarters and presidential Villa.  Babangida was present when the barracks were attacked but managed to escape by a back route.  In his coup address, Orkar called for the excision of five northern states, alleging that the Babangida regime marginalised the South.  However, the coup was crushed by the Babangida regime and Orkar including 41 other coconspirators were tried, convicted of treason and were executed by firing squad on July 27, 1990.  Related News  The Commissioner for Information, Benue State, Mike Inalegwu, told journalists in Markurdi on Tuesdaythat the decision to immortalise Orkar was taken at the meeting of the State Executive Council.  According to the information commissioner, the State Executive Council, at its Tuesday meeting, declared that everything that Orkar said then had come to pass, hence, its decision to immortalise him.  Inalegwu said, “To recognise one of its heroes, the Executive Council today decided to name a 9km township road that burst out at Apir after the late Major Gideon Orkar.  “When Orkar came out with that broadcast, nobody took it seriously but today all that Orkar said in that broadcast has come to pass. So, we, in Benue State, have come to realise that Orkar meant well for this country.  “So, in the council meeting today, we resolved that a street should be named after Gideon Orkar and that is to tell Nigerians that Orkar had prophesied about what the country is facing today and unfortunately, he was executed. The 9.7km road that bursts out at Apir will be named after Gideon Orkar.”"

According to the Times, Arsenal are far from content to rest on their laurels this summer. The Gunners are in no mood to sit back and admire the progress they’ve made this term and as such, are gearing up for a blockbuster transfer window.  Indeed, the publication report Arsenal have given Arteta the greenlight to sign West Ham captain, Declan Rice, and Brighton midfielder, Moises Caicedo.  The latter was a transfer target for the Gunners in January, though despite lodging sizeable bids, neither Arsenal or Chelsea could convince Brighton to cash in.  The situation could be different at season’s end and Arsenal are prepared to go above and beyond from a financial perspective to get deals done.  The Times report Arsenal’s summer spend ‘may exceed £200m’ when all is said and done. Rice and Caicedo are up first and per the report, will cost a combined £170m. The breakdown is speculated to be roughly £100m (including add-ons) for Rice and around £70m for Caicedo.  To free up both funds and squad space for the colossal outlay, the report names four first-team stars who could be sold.  Centre-back, Rob Holding, midfielder Granit Xhaka and attackers Emile Smith Rowe and Folarin Balogun are the quartet in question.  Of that foursome, it’s Xhaka who already has his next move lined up.  Xhaka nearing four-year deal with Leverkusen  Indeed, Sky Germany’s Florian Plettenberg brought news of Bayer Leverkusen lining the 30-year-old up. Their manager, Xabi Alonso, reportedly views Xhaka as a ‘top leader’ leader who can add a missing ingredient to his side.  Not long after, Fabrizio Romano tweeted a move to Leverkusen is quickly taking shape.  The trusted reporter noted Xhaka is “set to leave Arsenal at the end of the season”. A new contract is out of the question and both his and Arsenal’s plan is to sever ties.  Romano added Leverkusen are in “advanced” discussions over the deal and an agreement on personal terms is close. A four-year deal running until 2027 will be signed.  Story continues  Arsenal are primed to pocket around €15m (approx. £13m) from the sale. That is a far cry from the roughly £30m he was signed for from Borussia Monchengladbach in 2017, though is merely a by-product of the fact he’s now the wrong side of 30.  Xhaka is the first high profile exit on the agenda at the Emirates, though won’t be the last.  The Times named Holding, Smith Rowe and Balogun who were also present on a 14-man out-list, as reported by Goal.

With the country’s four mobile service providers now either directly or indirectly linked to Myanmar’s military, sensitive user data is more easily accessible and could be used to persecute opposition voices, experts say.  “The military in Myanmar has continued to oppress human rights online in the face of ongoing civil disobedience, political opposition, and armed conflict,” Freedom House researcher Kian Vesteinsson said.  The consolidation of mobile service providers means “people lose out on being able to express themselves freely or enjoy the privacy of their communications,” he said. “The distinct risk here is source safety and the safety of journalists.”  Since the coup, Myanmar’s military has killed more than 3,500 people, and over 17,900 remain detained for resisting the coup, according to the human rights research group, Assistance Association for Political Prisoners.  The U.N. Human Rights Office has said that the military’s actions, including airstrikes, likely amount to crimes against humanity and war crimes.  Consolidating control over mobile service providers is part of the military's broader strategy to monitor and censor the internet, according to experts and journalists.  Kyaw Hsan Hlaing, a freelance reporter who left Myanmar after the coup, believes media are at risk.  “For sure, independent media workers and journalists are the most at target,” said Kyaw Hsan Hlaing, who is now based in Hawaii.  Myanmar’s military did not reply to VOA’s request for comment about its use of telecommunication companies to track people in the country.  Myanmar has four mobile service providers: Mytel, ATOM, Ooredoo and MPT. Before the coup, the military already owned Mytel and MPT. Following the coup, ATOM — formerly the Myanmar operation of Norwegian telecom giant Telenor — and Qatari-owned Ooredoo’s Myanmar operation came under ownership of junta-affiliated firms, according to media reports.  But even before the coup, telecom and internet service providers had been ordered to install intercept spyware that could give the military power to listen in on calls, view texts and web traffic including emails, and to track user location, Reuters reported.  In Myanmar, telecom company ownership is shrouded in layers of secrecy. “It’s purposefully opaque,” says Oliver Spencer, an adviser at the group Free Expression Myanmar.  A former Myanmar telecom company employee, however, told VOA that to a certain extent, it doesn’t matter that all four companies are now linked to the military to varying degrees. The employee requested that their name and former company be withheld for safety reasons.  “In this current period, it doesn’t matter who owns or how linked the company is to the military. The response of the companies would be identical,” they said. “Compliance is the result.”  In an email to VOA, ATOM’s communications team said the telecom company respects its customers’ rights and privacy.  “ATOM Myanmar will never facilitate or allow unlawful interception requests or equipment,” ATOM said. “Our telecom operation will always act in a law-abiding, ethical manner.”  “We continue to provide essential communication services to the people of Myanmar while respecting local and international laws; upholding human rights; and advocating for consumer protection regulations, especially in terms of data security, data resilience, privacy, connectivity, roaming, internet access, and others,” ATOM said.  The other three telecom companies did not reply to VOA’s requests for comment.  The military is most interested in accessing the user data of potential political opponents, resistance members and journalists as part of its broader effort to squash dissent, analysts believe.  That data can include details on who a user texts or calls, the length of calls, location data, and contents of unencrypted messages. Sometimes data can even reveal website history and whether a user is using a VPN.  “All types of data requests that you can dream of — it’s all done here,” the former employee said.  All the military needs is a phone number. That allows them to track who else that individual calls and texts, according to Spencer. “They’re basically enabling the military to spy on their customers,” he said.  A former journalist, who has left Myanmar but asked for anonymity for safety reasons, says that when a reporter’s “mobile number is exposed to police and military intelligence” they are no longer secure.  “The journalists who are living in Myanmar are aware of digital safety,” he said, adding that more and more reporters use encrypted platforms, regularly delete messages, and use two phones — one for reporting and another for non-sensitive use. The latter helps them pass through checkpoints, where police regularly check and confiscate phones.  Journalists still inside Myanmar also often change their SIM cards for security reasons, according to Nu Nu Lusan, a freelance reporter based in Malaysia.  “I don’t have much to worry about since I live outside the country, but my concern is for the sources in Myanmar,” she said. She uses secure messaging platforms to communicate with sources on the ground.  The Myanmar military’s control over technology and the internet with web shutdowns, online censorship, and surveillance has led U.N. experts to describe the strategy as an attempt to establish a “digital dictatorship.”  Although the former telecom company employee said the situation is less risky if users have access to a VPN and use encrypted messaging platforms, “where the internet is cut off but the phone line is not — that’s where the risks are for journalists and activists.”  Across the country, all 330 townships have been subjected to internet shutdowns at least once in 2022, with about 50 townships facing shutdowns that measure more than one year, according to a February report from the digital rights group Access Now.  “I try secure online communication options, but most conflict areas have no internet access,” Lusan said, so sources have to go somewhere with service. “There is no absolute safe communication when I communicate via telephone with the sources.”  All of this means it can be dangerous for people on the ground to communicate with each other and access banned independent news websites, which makes it harder for people to stay up to date on what’s happening in their country and around the world.  “This is the military strategy,” Spencer said, “to create a system of fear.”"

For decades, as Pakistani military remained the force that decided the country's fate, Ustad Daman's mockery stood the test of time; a subsistence of dry humour typical of two Punjabs of the Indian subcontinent, bitterly partitioned into present-day India, Pakistan and eventually Bangladesh after the British left in 1947.  But on May 9, 2023, when hundreds of enraged supporters of ousted Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan pushed through the gates of army headquarters in Rawalpindi, the army, unlike Ustad Daman's poetic assertion, was nowhere to be seen.  Hours earlier, Khan, Pakistan's cricket icon-turned-populist politician, was arrested from a courtroom in capital Islamabad, where he had sought bail for one of over 142 corruption cases filed against him through the Army-run National Accountability Bureau (NAB).  ALSO WATCH | Imran Khan arrest: 9 killed, over 2,000 arrested across Pakistan | WION Fineprint × Days later, after the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief managed to get bail and a two-week arrest freeze following the Supreme Court's intervention, an emboldened Khan launched an even more vigorous attack on the army; recalling its humiliating defeat in 1971 that led to the creation of Bangladesh and Osama bin Laden's killing in 2011 in Abbottabad in an operation by the US Special Forces. Pakistan turmoil: Cracks within the army in spotlight For the first time in Pakistan’s history, action against a political leader inspired a 'mini-intifada' against the military itself. But despite an unprecedented action from Khan's supporters, there is no unprecedented counter-reaction from the army (which history suggests, is usually a coup or imposition of Emergency in Pakistan). Instead, the army was quick enough to ward off the speculations of Martial Law imposition.  The army pulled its guards back, and let the looting of its officers’ homes take place, avoiding bloodshed near key military installations.  But why such stoicism?  Divisions or rifts within the army are now emerging as the most plausible reason behind Rawalpindi's refusal to formally take over Islamabad's corridors of power.  The rift within the army has been evident since General Asim Munir took over as Army chief against officers like Lieutenant General Faiz Hameed, who were seen as more sympathetic to Imran Khan.  ""It would be unwise of the army to take over directly because the situation is so bad in Pakistan when it comes to not just the economy but also the terrorism. Whoever is directly in charge would incur further unpopularity,"" Sharat Sabharwal, India's former ambassador to Pakistan, and author of 'India's Pakistan Conundrum: Managing a Complex Relationship', told WION.  Pointing towards the relationship of ""mutual dependence"" between the army and the civilian leadership, Sabharwal asked: ""Why would they do it when they have a civilian façade from where they continue to operate?"" What lies ahead for Pakistan: Emergency or technocratic government? Immediately after the events of May 9th, a proposal for the imposition of a state of Emergency was laid out in a cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.  A national state of Emergency will give the authority to the army without taking over directly. ""A civilian government can declare Emergency and call the army out and the latter can do their bit,"" Sabharwal told WION.  In the past, the moments of crisis in the chaotic relationship of mutual dependence between the Pakistan Army and the civilian government have led to the formation of technocratic governments.  In a technocratic government, individuals are appointed to the ministries on the basis of their expertise and are not necessarily career politicians. Most recently, between 2004 and 2007, Pakistani dictator Pervez Musharraf installed Shaukat Aziz, a former banker and financier, as prime minister in a technocratic government.  Pakistan has justified military takeovers and formation of such technocratic governments with a ""doctrine of necessity"", which refers to extraordinary actions to restore order even if such actions contravene established laws.  ""The Supreme Court is made to give an endorsement in making an exception to the constitution,"" Sabharwal said, while cautioning that such an endorsement may not come easy during the tenure of current chief justice Umar Ata Bandial.  ""The chief justices in the past have been browbeaten by the army and made to act in their favour. But this one so far has not done so. He would have known that the army was behind Imran Khan's arrest and despite that he ordered his release. He's a bold guy,"" Sabharwal said. A novel outburst against the army Meanwhile, a number of Pakistanis have come out to cheer the way a section of their fellow citizens have brazenly rounded upon the armed forces. This, according to Burzine Waghmar, a member of the Centre for the Study of Pakistan at SOAS University of London, is a “novel outburst”.  But this does not, according to Waghmar, imply Pakistanis are reclaiming their agency or dignity.  Waghmar contends that eventually, Army chief General Asim Munir's hand ""may be forced into declaring martial law"".  “And this would be privately welcomed by the West, even if they publicly feign empathy, for the Pakistani populace,” Waghmar told WION.

Ecuador’s National Assembly has begun an impeachment hearing against President Guillermo Lasso, who stands accused of corruption with regard to an embezzlement scheme involving a state-owned oil transport company.  But the hearings, which launched on Tuesday, could trigger a potentially explosive showdown between the president and the country’s unicameral legislature.  Experts have speculated that Lasso could invoke a never-before-used constitutional clause known as “two-way death”, which would allow him to both dissolve the legislature and end his presidency.  Speaking to the legislators on Tuesday, Lasso maintained he was guilty of no wrongdoing. “There is no evidence, nor relevant testimonies,” he told the lawmakers. “Rather, all there is is information that proves my total, evident and unquestionable innocence.”  In an interview with Al Jazeera, Ana Belen, a member of Lasso’s Creating Opportunities party, called Tuesday’s proceedings, if successful, “nothing short of a parliamentarian coup”.  But members of the opposition have rejected such accusations, calling instead for an end to government corruption.  “This is no coup. We’re not trying to destabilise the country,” Viviana Veloz, an opposition member of the assembly, told Al Jazeera. “It is a response to a demand by citizens, a desperate clamour for a constitutional solution to a problem called Guillermo Lasso.”  At issue in Tuesday’s hearing was Lasso’s decision not to intervene to end an embezzlement scheme between the state-owned oil transport company Flota Petrolera Ecuatoriana and the private entity Amazonas Tankers.  Opponents say the scheme cost the state millions in losses and is part of a pattern of corruption within the administration.      Lasso has denied the allegations, with his supporters saying the president had no responsibility to intervene in the deal between the two companies, which had been struck before he took office in 2021.  “Remember that this contract was signed in 2018 by the previous government,” Belen told Al Jazeera. “Investigators have found no penal responsibility, so there can’t be a political one.”  Lasso has previously hinted that he could trigger the “muerte cruzada” or “two-way death” clause of Ecuador’s constitution if he appears to be on the cusp of impeachment, according to Al Jazeera correspondent Alessandro Rampietti, who reported from the capital Quito.  That decision could happen any time before the vote, Rampietti added.  Such a move would mean Lasso is declaring “the situation in the country is so complicated that governing is not an option anymore”, he said.  “That would mean essentially dissolving Congress, also the end of his presidency and calling for early elections. But he would then have the opportunity to continue governing by decree for the next six months.”  “It has never been done before in Ecuador,” Rampietti explained. “It’s considered an extreme political decision.”  Analysts fear such a move could spark protests similar to those that broke out last year over the rising cost of living. Further instability would rock a country already contending with deteriorating economic conditions and a tide of drug-related killings.  For its part, the opposition believes it has the supermajority needed to succeed in its impeachment attempt. A supermajority is reached with 92 votes out of the 137-person chamber — in other words, a two-thirds majority.  Lasso, a 67-year-old former banker, narrowly survived an impeachment vote last year, with only 80 legislators voting in favour.      Opinions were divided on the streets of Quito, where some citizens spoke in support of Lasso’s impeachment.  “The Congress is representing the will of the people. This government has only destroyed our health and education systems,” Carla Araujo told Al Jazeera.

Watching it again this past week made me wonder: Is it remotely possible that America’s domestic spies and malefactors – who conspired to subvert and perhaps destroy our republic the past seven years – might also someday feel guilt and shame enough to come clean?  The Durham report on the FBI’s Russia collusion coup lays bare the fact that federal intelligence and law enforcement agencies under Barack Obama cynically conspired to gin up an investigation of candidate-turned-President Donald Trump. While cozying up to the Hillary Clinton campaign, the agency ignored intelligence of “a trusted foreign source pointing to a Clinton campaign plan to vilify Trump by tying him to Vladimir Putin so as to divert attention from her own concerns relating to her use of a private email server.”  The world-class conspiracy, involving an unknown number of unindicted co-conspirators, led to trumped-up charges against former Trump National Security Advisor Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn (who is now suing the government for $50 million for wrongful prosecution); illegal surveillance of a Trump supporter, aided by the phony Steele dossier and by repeated bald-faced government lies to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court; and a two-year, multimillion-dollar Potemkin “probe” by special prosecutor Robert Mueller that hamstrung and further divided America.  All this, despite the fact that Christopher Steele’s own researcher had told the FBI in May 2017 there was absolutely nothing to the dossier. Yet the political operatives atop the agency plowed on in their scheme to destroy Trump and install their preferred political regime.  Does that even sound like America?  Even the far-left New York Times had to admit that Inspector General Michael Horowitz “painted a bleak portrait of the F.B.I. as a dysfunctional agency that severely mishandled its surveillance powers.”  There is a long history and a tragic trail of victims of FBI incompetence and corruption. But the Russia collusion fabrication – an attempt to first swing an election and then, failing that, nothing short of an attempted coup – is the darkest hour of a now wholly discredited law enforcement agency.  Emboldened by their ability to get away with their crimes against the American people, federal intelligence officials more recently conspired before the 2020 election to help Joe Biden by insinuating the damning Hunter Biden laptop was Russian disinformation. To pull off the ruse, they produced a letter bearing the weight of 51 former intelligence officials. And now we know it was all to give the elder Biden cover during a presidential debate with Trump.  It also helped the Biden family corruption story – which, three years later, has fresh legs – to go away in time for the fateful election.  But again, as bad as that was, the Russia hoax is “the biggest scandal in American history, that we’re still living with today,” says former U.S. Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., who was among the first to unearth the conspiracy years ago.  “This changed the course of human history. It changed the course of our elections.”  Undoubtedly. Still, the reason we’re “still living” with it is because the spies and malefactors behind it all can somehow live with themselves, and apparently won’t slink out of the slimy sewers of espionage to own up to their crimes.  They should. And they must.  If there’s a shred of decency, a shard of shame, left inside them, they’ll step out of the darkened alleys of their contemptible crimes to tell their countrymen, the world and posterity what they have done to the nation and to the cause of freedom.  And then they’ll fall to their knees and beg Americans for forgiveness.  I’ve watched The Lives of Others before, but it has a particularly somber resonance today. For, like the East Germans of old, we, too, live under a government that has turned on its own people – at least those of us who refuse to conform to the liberal orthodoxy of the current ruling class and its torch-wielding sycophants bent on breaking down the few doors to power they don’t already control.  In the film, the victim eventually learns that his Stasi spy had secretly grown to care for and actually protect him from government overseers. In a free and unified Germany, the victim later writes a book called Sonata for a Good Man – which he has cryptically dedicated to the spy who came in from the cold.  Could that happen here? Could any of those in our intelligence and law enforcement agencies who have knowingly subverted our republic feel remorse sufficient to admit their crimes – offenses which they compound every morning when they wake up in a free country they don’t deserve to live in, much less “serve”?  Are there no good men left?"

Now, five suspected members of a terrorist group linked to the ""Reichsbürger"" movement are facing trial.  The trial of five suspected members of the ""Vereinte Patrioten"" (United Patriots) group begins on Wednesday (May 17) at the Higher Regional Court in the western German city of Koblenz.  The four men, along with a 75-year-old woman who is suspected of being the group's ringleader, are accused of planning to overthrow the German government. According to federal prosecutors, they got together in mid-January 2022 and called themselves the ""Vereinte Patrioten"". They are now charged with founding or being a member of a terrorist organization.  The group stands accused of wanting to unleash a civil war-like situation by causing an electricity blackout and kidnapping German Health Minister Karl Lauterbach. Their goal: the end of the parliamentary democracy in Germany.  After their planned takeover, the accused wanted to assume control of government agencies themselves. Federal prosecutors, therefore, accused them of ""preparing high treason against the federal government.""  The plotters had been planning to kidnap Health Minister Karl Lauterbach. Image: Tobias Schwarz/AFP/Getty Images  How advanced were the group's plans?  Investigators have described ""concrete preparations"" by the accused, who communicated primarily via a chat group on the Telegram online messaging service and met several times in various locations.  One of the accused scouted targets for attacks on the electricity network. Another planned the kidnapping of the health minister, ""if necessary, by killing his bodyguards.""  To that end, the group obtained kalashnikovs and pistols as well as ammunition. They also wanted to import barrels of explosives from the former Yugoslavia.  Part of the 'Reichsbürger' movement?  The alleged ideological leader of the group is a 75-year-old former pastor and teacher who most recently lived in Saxony. Her writings were found on the blogs of the ""Reichsbürger"" (Citizens of the Reich) movement. They are written in the characteristic style of the 23,000-member movement which claims that the German Reich — Germany under the rule of an emperor — still exists as it did until 1918. The Reichsbürger reject all current state authorities as unlawful.  Open letters the woman is accused of writing on ""Reichsbürger"" blogs are addressed to Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump, or ""the Allies."" In them, she expresses antisemitic thoughts, signed with ""Wilhelm-Emperor-Rex-Descendants,"" implying that she saw herself as a successor of the last German emperor.  Federal prosecutors are convinced that the woman and her accomplices were more than eccentric imposters. According to the group's theory that the German Reich continues to exist based on the constitution of 1871, they would conclude that the democratic order of the Federal Republic of Germany was invalid. Instead, an authoritarian system of government modeled on the German Empire must be reintroduced.  Why target the health minister?  Karl Lauterbach has long been considered a bogeyman by Germany's ""Querdenker"" (lateral thinkers) and ""Reichsbürger"" movements. Even before he was appointed health minister in December 2021, the professor of medicine made countless media appearances as an expert during the COVID-19 pandemic. During these, he advocated for strict measures such as limitations on interpersonal contact to combat the spread of the virus. He continued this course when he entered office as minister.  In doing so, he drew hatred from extremist circles who rejected government measures to combat the pandemic in Germany. Lauterbach remains under round-the-clock protection to this day.  How was the group discovered?  An undercover investigator is said to have played a key role in the arrests of the suspects. He was deployed in the surroundings of the accused for months.  On April 13, 2022, the four accused men were arrested, and the woman on October 13 the same year. Since then, they have been remanded in custody.  If the court finds them guilty, they are likely to face several years in prison.  This article was originally written in German.

The latest round in tensions between Baku and Tehran, whose relations have traditionally been strained, came after the expulsion of diplomats from both countries.  On Tuesday, Azerbaijan’s law enforcement forces arrested people who “were working for Iranian secret services,” the interior ministry, security service, and the office of prosecutor general said in a joint statement.  The statement gave nine names and said several other people had been arrested.  The group was plotting a “violent overthrow of the government and the assassinations of prominent personalities and senior officials,” the statement said.  The wave of arrests follows the detention of six Azerbaijani nationals in a different case in April. They were accused of being “recruited by Iranian secret services to destabilize the situation in the country.”  Azerbaijan is a close ally of Iran’s historical rival, Turkey.  Tehran also fears that Israel – a major weapons supplier to Azerbaijan – could use Azerbaijani territory for an offensive against Iran.  Ties between neighbors Azerbaijan and Iran further soured in January when a gunman stormed into Baku’s embassy in Tehran.  He killed a diplomat and wounded two embassy security guards.  The Azerbaijani foreign ministry blamed Iran for the shooting, a claim that the Iranian foreign ministry has rejected.  Earlier in May, Iran expelled four Azerbaijani diplomats. The foreign ministry said the move was “in response” to Baku’s expulsion of Iranian embassy staff in April."

The drifting of the trusted Muslim vote bank from the SP has added to the woes of the party struggling to reclaim its dominant position in Uttar Pradesh politics.  The SP, claiming to be the only viable alternative to the Bharatiya Janata Party in Uttar Pradesh, has tasted successive defeats in the last 10 years in two elections to Lok Sabha in 2014, 2019 and two to UP assembly in 2017 and 2022. The SP has also failed to retain two Lok Sabha and two assembly seats in by-elections and lost them to the BJP.  Sources in the party said successive defeats coupled with near rout in urban local bodies elections do not augur well for the future of SP, the main opposition party in UP.

In some places land subsidence is 20cm a year. Sea level rises are around 0.5cm/year. The rate of land subsidence is therefore far above that of sea-level rise; in some places, by a factor of 40. The sinking land, combined with sea level rise, increases the flood risk of the city as a whole.  Flood events have dramatically increased over the past century. In 1892, only two flood events were recorded. By 1960 that had risen to five. By 2010 that had leapt to 10.  This increase is not so much related to rainfall as the data for total monthly rainfall between 1860 2007 is flat. Jakarta's increasing susceptibility to flood risk, therefore, cannot be attributed to climate change-induced changes in rainfall patterns.

But those increases also reflected a big gap from the slow activity at the height of China’s “zero-COVID” restrictions, which Beijing abandoned late in 2022.  “While the boost from reopening should still underpin a further recovery in the near-term, the bulk of China’s rebound is now behind us,” Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a report.

Use Next and Previous buttons to navigate  BANGKOK (AP) — Following a stunning election victory in which they together captured a majority of seats in the House of Representatives, Thailand’s top two opposition parties began planning Monday for the next stage in their bid to replace the military-dominated government.  The Move Forward Party, led by 42-year-old businessman Pita Limjaroenrat, placed first in the election, surpassing most expectations. It squeaked past the Pheu Thai party, which had been favored to top the polls.  Pheu Thai stumbled despite the star power of Paetongtarn Shinawatra, daughter of Thaksin Shinawatra, the former populist prime minister who was toppled by a 2006 military coup and is the driving force behind the party.  “The overwhelming electoral victory by Move Forward and Pheu Thai is a decisive sign that voters want a polity where the people, not the military, decide their future,” said Tyrell Haberkorn, a Thai studies scholar at the University of Wisconsin.  “Voters want a Thailand with free speech, without compulsory military conscription, and where the people’s voices are valued, not something to be silenced or bought,” she said.  Pita said Monday he has been talking to five other parties about forming a coalition government. It would have 309 House seats in total, providing more stability than the 292-seat partnership with Pheu Thai as a sole ally. Parliament selects a new prime minister in July, so has about two months to seal a deal.  Move Forward's supporters drove through the streets of Bangkok on Monday afternoon to celebrate their victory. Pita smiled broadly and waved as a convoy of open trucks took him and other party members slowly through the streets of the old part of the capital.  Thailand for the past nine years has been led by former army commander Prayuth Chan-ocha, who seized power in a 2014 military coup and was returned as prime minister after the 2019 election. He ran for reelection on Sunday, but has been blamed for a lagging economy, a botched initial response to the coronavirus pandemic and for thwarting democratic reforms — a particular sore point with younger voters.  “The sentiment of the era has changed and it’s right,” Pita said Monday. “And today it’s a new day and hopefully it’s full of bright sunshine of hope going forward.”  Earlier, as it became clear his party was taking the lead, he tweeted that he is ready to bring about change as the country’s 30th prime minister. “Whether you agree or disagree with me, I will be your prime minister. Whether you have voted for me or not, I will serve you.""  Move Forward and Pheu Thai are mostly allied in their opposition to the military’s recurring interference in politics, demonstrated by more than a dozen coups it has staged since 1932, when Thailand became a constitutional monarchy, and most recently in 2006 and 2014.  Both parties also favor reform of some aspects of the monarchy, a position that riles the conservative royalist establishment that regards the institution as sacrosanct. Because Move Forward has been more outspoken on the subject, it is regarded as radical in the context of mainstream Thai politics.  With almost all votes counted Monday, Move Forward had captured a projected 151 seats in the lower house by winning over 24% of the popular vote for 400 constituency seats, and more than 36% of the votes for the 100 seats allocated by proportional representation.  Pheu Thai party trailed a close second with its combined seat total projected at 141.  Prayuth's United Thai Nation Party holds fifth spot in the constituency vote and third in the party-preference tally, for a projected total of 36 seats.  Although the numbers place Pita in a favorable position for becoming the next prime minister, he faces a difficult path.  Candidates are handicapped by constitutional rules crafted by the military government to restrain political parties with populist appeals from taking root and upending the long-established conservative order.  The prime minister is elected by a joint session of the 500 members of the newly elected House and 250 senators, who were appointed by the military. The winner must secure at least 376 votes.  The Senate, a stalwart defender of the royalist order along with the army and the courts, voted unanimously for Prayuth in 2019, enabling him to overcome Pheu Thai’s first-place finish and form a coalition government.  There is a strong possibility that Pita will be seen as too radical by some partner parties, and they will have to look for a more moderate candidate.  Pheu Thai’s Paetongtarn is the most popular choice of her party base. But her ties to her father, Thaksin, with whom the military has never reconciled since ousting him in 2006, would make winning any support from the Senate difficult. One of Pheu Thai’s other candidates for prime minister, real estate magnate Srettha Thavisin, would stand a better chance in that case.  There are also fears the conservative elements in Thai politics would again employ what critics consider to be dirty tricks to keep a hold on power. Since Thaksin’s fall, they have repeatedly used the courts and so-called independent state agencies such as the Election Commission to issue controversial legal rulings to cripple or sink political threats from opponents. Such efforts would likely stir up vigorous street protests.  “Is the form of coalition that Pita proposed, with 309 seats, stable enough? In a democratic world, it’s the most stable. But in a world of half-dictatorship that has the Senate as an important variable, Move Forward must lever the Senate with the people’s voices,” said Pinkaew Laungaramsri, a professor of anthropology at Chiang Mai University.  “We have to wait and see whether the authoritarians will dare using their illegitimate authorities that go against the will of the people. If they do that, it’s just creating a condition for the people to go back onto the streets,* she said.  ___  Associated Press video journalist Jerry Harmer contributed to this report."

The progressive Move Forward Party, which gained a huge following among young Thais for its reformist platform, won the most seats and the largest share of the popular vote.  Pheu Thai, the main opposition party that has been a populist force in Thailand for 20 years, came second.  Together they delivered a crushing blow to the conservative, military-backed establishment that has ruled on and off for decades, often by turfing out popularly elected governments in coups.  “This is an unmistakable frontal rebuke, a rejection of Thailand’s military authoritarian past. It’s a rejection of military dominance in politics,” said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political scientist from Chulalongkorn University.  Over the last two decades, each time Thais have been allowed to vote, they have done so overwhelmingly in support of the military’s political opponents. Sunday’s vote – which saw a record turnout – was a continuation of that tradition.  But despite winning a landslide, it is far from certain who will be the next leader.  Supporters of the Move Forward Party react as they watch results come in at the party headquarters in Bangkok on May 14, after polls closed in Thailand's general election. Jack Taylor/AFP/Getty Images  That’s because the military junta that last seized power in 2014 rewrote the constitution to ensure they maintain a huge say in who can lead, whether or not they win the popular vote.  Neither opposition party won an outright majority of 376 seats needed to form a government outright, they will need to strike deals and wrangle support from other parties to form a coalition big enough to ensure victory.  But that won’t necessarily be straightforward.  Dangerous territory  The first thing to know is that any opposition party or coalition hoping to form a government must overcome the powerful voting bloc of the senate.  Under the junta-era constitution, Thailand’s unelected 250-seat senate is chosen entirely by the military and has previously voted for a pro-military candidate.  Because a party needs a majority of the combined houses – 750 seats – to elect a prime minister, it means opposition parties need almost three times as many votes in the lower house to be able to elect the next leader and form a government.  In 2019, coup leader Prayut Chan-o-cha won the senate votes which ensured his party’s coalition gained enough seats to elect him as prime minister, despite Pheu Thai being the largest party.  There are also other threats to the progressive movement’s win. Parties that have previously pushed for change have run afoul of the powerful conservative establishment – a nexus of the military, monarchy and influential elites.  Move Forward Party leader and prime ministerial candidate, Pita Limjaroenrat, attends a press conference following the general election, at the party's headquarters in Bangkok, Thailand, on May 15. Athit Perawongmetha/Reuters  Lawmakers have faced bans, parties have been dissolved, and governments have been overthrown. Thailand has witnessed a dozen successful coups since 1932, including two in the past 17 years.  And the purportedly independent election commission, anti-corruption commission and the constitutional court are all dominated in favor of the establishment.  In the progressive camp’s favor, however, is their large margin over the military-backed parties.  “If the results were murky, or if the pro-military parties got more, then we would be looking at manipulation, trying to shave the margins. But the results are so clear and very difficult to overturn now,” said Thitinan, adding that if there were attempts to subvert the vote, there would be public anger and protests.  Move Forward’s predecessor the Future Forward Party won the third most seats in the 2019 election. Shortly afterward, several of the party’s leaders were banned from politics and the party was later dissolved after a court ruled it violated electoral finance rules.  In the short term, that decision ended the threat from the Future Forward Party. But it also, in many ways, laid the foundation for Sunday’s historic vote.  Youth-led protests erupted across Thailand in 2020 after Future Forward was dissolved and a whole new generation of young political leaders were born, some of whom were willing to debate a previously taboo topic – royal reform.  Those calls electrified Thailand, where any frank discussion of the monarchy is fraught with the threat of prison under one of the strictest lese majeste laws in the world.  Many youth leaders were jailed or face ongoing prosecution linked to those protests. But some also went on to create the Move Forward party that swept to victory in the popular vote on Sunday.  That leaves the military establishment now locked in a political battle with a party that has kept the subject of royal reform on its manifesto.  Experts have said another coup would be costly, and dissolving a party with such a mandate would be “drastic.”  “Dissolving a party is a fairly drastic move. If there’s a way of keeping Move Forward out without dissolving them, then conservative politicians would probably prefer to do that. Because it’s not as strong a step in subverting the will that people have expressed,” said Susannah Patton, director of the Southeast Asia Program at the Lowy Institute.  “But you can’t rule that out.”  See why Thailand's ex-coup leader is showing a softer side ahead of election 02:58 - Source: CNN  Vote for change cannot be ignored  Move Forward’s allure went beyond the youth vote on which it built its base.  Unofficial results showed the party captured 32 out of 33 seats in Bangkok – traditionally a stronghold for conservative parties.  “What this shows is that people who are living in urban areas are really fed up with the government that the military has provided for almost a decade,” said Patton.  “They are wanting to choose something different, and Move Forward is not just the youth party but actually can attract a wider cross section of support as well.”  Move Forward’s radical agenda includes reforming the military, getting rid of the draft, reducing the military’s budget, making it more transparent and accountable, as well as constitutional change and to bring the military and monarchy within the constitution.  The party’s win over the populist juggernaut Pheu Thai is also significant. This is the first time a party linked with ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has lost an election since 2001.  And Pheu Thai’s marginal defeat to Move Forward shows voters’ frustration with the old cycle of politics that pitted populist Thaksin-linked parties against the establishment.  Thailand’s “two party system was already breaking down in 2019, but it’s continuing to break down this election,” said Patton.  In a press conference on Monday, Move Forward leader Pita Limjaroenrat said the party would go forward with plans to amend the country’s strict lese majeste laws – a key campaign pledge despite the taboo surrounding any discussion of the royal family in Thailand.  One of his priorities is to support young people facing jail terms on lese majeste charges, and Pita warned that if the law remains as it is, the relationship between the Thai people and the monarchy will only worsen.  His policies “strike at heart of the establishment,” said Thitinan, and even talking about the monarchy openly “is an affront to the palace.”  The Move Forward leader said Monday that he wants to form an alliance with the four other opposition parties to secure a majority in the lower house.  It could take 60 days before a prime ministerial candidate is endorsed by Thailand’s combined houses of parliament, but Sunday’s vote shows the people are ready for change.  However, if Thailand’s turbulent recent history is anything to go by, that could mean little. The military has shown in the past that it has few qualms about ignoring the popular vote."

Who becomes the next prime minister will depend on a vote set for July that includes all the House lawmakers plus the 250-seat military-appointed Senate, whose members share the establishment’s conservative policies. The winner must attain at least 376 of their combined 750 seats.  Opposition parties have criticized the process as undemocratic. It’s a legacy of the 2014 coup and a new constitution drafted in its aftermath that was meant to ensure that the military and the state bureaucracy, the main upholders of the royal order, continue to hold sway.  Analysts have pointed out that a lot can still happen before the Election Commission even declares the results valid, a process that can take up to 75 days and will almost certainly include legal challenges.  In the past, the commission and the courts have used their authority to disqualify opposition parties.  What the opposition wants  Move Forward leader Pita Limjaroenrat tweeted that he is ready to bring about change as the country’s 30th prime minister.  “Whether you agree or disagree with me, I will be your prime minister. Whether you have voted for me or not, I will serve you,” he wrote.  Although he energized younger voters with his progressive agenda, the businessman has alarmed conservatives with calls for reform of the monarchy, the institution that has been traditionally treated as sacrosanct.  In 2019, the Constitutional Court ousted his colleague from Parliament on charges of violating the election law and dissolved the Future Forward party, which then changed its name and leadership to become Move Forward.  It had been supporting amending the draconian law that punishes defaming the monarchy, which according to critics has been used as a tool to quash political dissent and imprison pro-democracy student activists.  Student-led protests beginning in 2020 openly criticized the monarchy, previously a taboo subject, leading to vigorous prosecutions under the law. They were also dismayed by the dissolution of the Future Forward party, which they believed was an unfair use of state power.  Thaksin’s shadow  Pheu Thai is led by Paetongtarn Shinawatra, the daughter of billionaire former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra who was toppled in a 2006 coup.  The power struggle between Thaksin’s supporters, many of them rural poor who benefited from his populist policies, and his conservative opponents has been fought – sometimes in the street, sometimes at the ballot box – for almost two decades.  In the 2014 coup, Mr. Chan-ocha unseated the government of Yingluck Shinawatra – Paetongtarn’s aunt, Thaksin’s sister – as prime minister. And Pheu Thai topped the field in the 2019 vote, only to be denied power when the army-backed Palang Pracharath Party found partners to assemble a coalition government.

Photo: Lillian Suwanrumpha/AFP via Getty  Thai voters made clear in Sunday's election that they want change. The question is now whether the military-aligned establishment will let them have it.  Why it matters: Sunday's result was a political earthquake, not just because pro-democracy parties trounced pro-military ones, but also because the progressive party that finished first, Move Forward, campaigned on the once-taboo topic of reforming the monarchy.  Move Forward leader Pita Limjaroenrat, a former business executive and relative newcomer to politics who studied at Harvard and MIT, introduced himself on Monday as ""the next prime minister of Thailand.""  The twin pillars of Thailand's establishment, the military and the monarchy, have the power to block him. Thailand has seen 12 successful coups since 1932, and parties or candidates have frequently been disqualified from holding office even after elections were held.  But such an intervention would risk ""major street violence"" and create ""an incredibly unstable situation,"" says Joshua Kurlantzick, senior fellow for Southeast Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations.  ""Thailand is the only upper-middle income country that regularly has coups,"" Kurlantzick tells Axios. ""Young Thais are tired of the economy and politics being stuck in this archaic past, run by generals and kings.""  The big picture: Before Sunday's shock result, the election had been billed as a showdown between the military and the Shinawatra political dynasty, represented by the Pheu Thai party.  Parties associated with former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra had won the most seats in every election since 2001, but were repeatedly elbowed out of power by the coup-prone military.  This time, Thaksin's daughter Paethongtarn Shinawatra was on the ballot, facing off against Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who led a 2014 coup and retained power after the 2019 election. His popularity has since collapsed.  Meanwhile, massive pro-democracy protests broke out in 2020, with student leaders demanding reform not just of the military, but also of the monarchy.  That was unprecedented in a country where lèse-majesté laws mean criticizing Thailand's king can result in jail time. Dozens of protesters remain in prison.  In this election, Pheu Thai stuck to its pitch of lifting up lower-income voters but avoided the reform proposals that had energized the youthful protesters.  ""Pheu Thai fought the wrong war, the populism war that it already won. Move Forward takes the game to the next level with institutional reform. That's the new battleground in Thai politics,"" Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political scientist at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, told Reuters.  By the numbers: Move Forward won an estimated 151 of the 500 lower house seats, nearly sweeping the capital, Bangkok. Pheu Thai won 141. Pita announced on Monday that they'll try to form a government with four smaller parties, bringing the bloc's total to 309 seats.  That clear majority could nonetheless be insufficient because a new constitution brought in under Prayuth's junta gave 250 military-appointed senators a vote on prospective prime ministers. If the Senate votes against Pita's coalition, it would be rejected.  But Prayuth's party and another military-backed party only won a combined 76 seats.  Even if the pro-military bloc gets other nonaligned parties onside, it could only cobble together a very weak minority government. That is, unless it enticed Pheu Thai to join forces, though that currently looks unlikely.  What they're saying: Paethongtarn Shinawatra congratulated Pita and said she expects their parties to be able to work ""smoothly together.""  Prayuth said he respects ""the democratic process and the election results,"" a message that's undercut somewhat by his recent history as a coup leader.  For his part, Pita said there would be ""a hefty price to pay for someone who’s thinking of abolishing the election results or forming a minority government,"" adding: ""I don’t think the people of Thailand would allow that to happen.”  What's next: Thailand's Election Commission has 60 days to confirm the results, during which time Pita will likely work to solidify his coalition, while the other major players will plan their next moves."

Zelensky landed by helicopter at Chequers, the British leader’s official country retreat, and was greeted by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. It’s Zelensky’s second trip to the UK since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.  This is the fourth European country Zelenskky has visited in the past few days. He is seeking more aid as Ukraine prepares a long-anticipated spring offensive to retake territory seized by Russia.  Ukraine’s leader made an unannounced visit to Paris on Sunday evening to meet French President Emmanuel Macron, after trips to Germany and Italy, where he met those countries’ leaders and Pope Francis.  A message posted Monday on Zelensky’s official Telegram Channel said: “Today — London. The UK is leading the way when it comes to expanding our capabilities on the ground and in the air. This cooperation will continue today. I will meet my friend Rishi. We will conduct substantive negotiations face-to-face and in delegations.”  The UK has become one of Ukraine’s major military allies, sending Kyiv short-range missiles and Challenger tanks and training 15,000 Ukrainian troops on British soil. Last week Britain announced it had sent Ukraine Storm Shadow cruise missiles, which have a range of more than 250 kilometers (150 miles) — the first known shipment of the weaponry that Kyiv has long sought from its allies.  Sunak’s office said that on Monday Britain will confirm it is giving Ukraine hundreds more air defense missiles, as well as “long-range attack drones” with a range of more than 200 kilometers (120 miles).  “This is a crucial moment in Ukraine’s resistance to a terrible war of aggression they did not choose or provoke,” Sunak said. “They need the sustained support of the international community to defend against the barrage of unrelenting and indiscriminate attacks that have been their daily reality for over a year.  “We must not let them down.”  Sunak will also push allies to deliver more support to Ukraine at a meeting of Group of Seven leaders in Japan later this week, Downing Street said.  As Zelensky visited European capitals, Russia stepped up attacks across Ukraine with drones and missiles over the weekend. On Sunday, Russia shelled two communities in the northern border region of Sumy, the region’s military administration said in a statement on its official Telegram channel. It said 109 explosions were recorded.  Zelensky and Macron met for about three hours on Sunday at the French presidential Elysee Palace — an encounter kept under wraps until shortly before the Ukrainian leader’s arrival in Paris.  Macron’s office said France will supply dozens of light tanks and armored vehicles “in the weeks ahead,” without giving specific numbers. Also promised were more air defense systems, but again details weren’t made public.  More Ukrainians will also be made battle-ready, with France aiming to train about 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers in France this year and nearly 4,000 others in Poland as part of a wider European effort, Macron’s office said.  France has supplied Ukraine with an array of weaponry, include air defense systems, light tanks, howitzers and other arms and equipment and fuel.  France had dispatched a plane to pick up Zelensky in Germany, where he met with Chancellor Olaf Scholz earlier Sunday and discussed his country’s planned counteroffensive.  It was his first visit to Berlin since the start of the invasion and came a day after the German government announced a new package of military aid for Ukraine worth more than 2.7 billion euros ($3 billion), including tanks, anti-aircraft systems and ammunition.  After initially hesitating to provide Ukraine with lethal weapons, Germany has become one of the biggest suppliers of arms to Ukraine, including Leopard 1 and 2 battle tanks, and the sophisticated IRIS-T SLM air defense system. Modern Western hardware is considered crucial if Ukraine is to succeed in its planned counteroffensive.  In the western German city of Aachen, Zelensky also received the prestigious International Charlemagne Prize, awarded to him and the people of Ukraine.  On Saturday. he met Francis and Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni in Rome.  On the European trip, Zelensky said Ukraine will aim to liberate Russian-occupied areas within Ukraine’s internationally recognized borders, and not attack Russian territory.  The Washington Post cited previously undisclosed documents from a trove of US intelligence leaks suggesting that Zelensky has considered trying to capture areas in Russia proper for possible use as bargaining chips in peace negotiations to end the war launched by Moscow in February 2022. This would put him at odds with Western governments that have insisted that weapons they provide must not be used to attack targets in Russia.  Asked about the report, Zelensky said: “We don’t attack Russian territory, we liberate our own legitimate territory.”  “We have neither the time nor the strength (to attack Russia),” he said, according to an official interpreter. “And we also don’t have weapons to spare with which we could do this.”  “We are preparing a counterattack for the illegally occupied areas based on our constitutionally defined legitimate borders, which are recognized internationally,” Zelensky said.  Among areas still occupied by Russia are the Crimean peninsula and parts of eastern Ukraine with mainly Russian-speaking populations."

Awami League lawmaker Naheed on Wednesday filed the case against former army chief and former president Ziaur Rahman, retired Lieutenant Colonel Abu Taher, and 25 others, accusing them of taking part in the killings of her father Colonel Khandker Nazmul Huda, Major General Khaled Mosharraf, and Lieutenant Colonel ATM Haider in Dhaka during a turmoil inside the army on November 7, 1975.  ‘Naheed Izahar Khan filed the case against Ziaur Rahman for her father’s murder for the benefit of the current fascist Awami League regime. There is a political conspiracy behind it. The main reason is to divert domestic and foreign democracy-lovers’ attention from the ongoing anti-fascist movement,’ BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir said at a press conference at the party chairperson’s Gulshan office in Dhaka.  Giving a formal reaction about the case filed 48 years after the killing of Colonel Nazmul Huda in an army mutiny on November 7, 1975, the BNP leader said that Ziaur Rahman rather ordered the protection of Nazmul Huda.  In a written statement, the BNP secretary general mentioned that it was an irony that Naheed Ezaher Khan probably did not even read the book authored by her mother. Her mother, Neelufar Huda, clearly writes in the book titled ‘Colonel Huda O Amar Juddha’, stating the situation in which Colonel Huda was killed.  ‘The testimony of the people present there proves that on that day Ziaur Rahman ordered Colonel Nawazish Ahmed to protect Khaled Mosharraf, Colonel Huda, and Major Haider. On page 134 of the book written by the mother of the plaintiff, Naheed Ezaher Khan, Colonel Taher’s involvement in the murder has clearly emerged,’ Fakhrul said.  Mentioning that Colonel Huda was the brigade commander in Rangpur Cantonment in 1975, Fakhrul said that Colonel Huda was one of the participants in the military coup led by Khaled Mosharraf on November 3, 1975.  ‘He [Colonel Huda] came to Dhaka to lead the coup. It should be noted that the then army chief, Major General Ziaur Rahman, was put under house arrest to seize state power under Khaled Mosharraf. Basically, Khaled Mosharraf and his associates’ political ambitions led to the most brutal prison killings in history,’ he added.  Fakhrul said that the Khaled Mosharraf-led coup created an extremely chaotic environment in the army.  ‘By taking the opportunity, the Revolutionary Soldier Organization and Jasad Gono Bahini, led by Colonel Taher-Inu [Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal president Hasanul Haq Inu], staged a counter-coup, creating an army officer-soldier dispute in the army and participating in a far-reaching domestic-foreign plot to kill brutal army officers. Colonel Nazmul Huda, one of the participants in the Khaled Mosharraf-led coup, is a cruel victim,’ he said."

Now we know what he means.  If Labour wins next year, Starmer plans to rig future elections by giving the vote to millions of EU nationals, plus millions more 16 and 17-year-olds.  The plan would mean that 3.4million EU citizens with 'settled status' would be eligible to vote. Another 2.6million are 'pre-settled' and would doubtless be fast-tracked by Labour.  At a stroke, the electorate would be packed with some 6million foreign voters: More than enough to swing any general election – or a new EU referendum.  Enfranchising under-18s would add another 1.4million voters to the electoral roll.  © Provided by Daily Mail If Labour wins next year, Keir Starmer (pictured) plans to rig future elections by giving the vote to millions of EU nationals, plus millions more 16 and 17-year-olds  The audacity of this expansion of the franchise – the biggest for nearly a century since 1928, when most women got the vote – is exceeded only by its cynicism.  For Sir Keir knows, of course, that the great majority of these extra votes would go to him.  Handing the right to vote to foreigners and mid-teens would tilt the delicate balance of British politics permanently in Labour's favour. We know that Sir Keir would dearly love to reverse Brexit. Several million extra votes would enable him to pull off just such a coup within a few years of taking power.  Labour's plan would also be a giant step towards a one-party state. Many on the Left have looked enviously north of the border, as the SNP lowered the Scottish Parliament's voting age to 16 and extended it to EU citizens too.  Nicola Sturgeon, the former first minister, may now be disgraced and discredited, but – when it comes to her electoral initiatives – Labour is following her example.  Sir Keir's electoral stitch-up is so transparently self-interested that it amounts to political chicanery – 'dirty and nasty' indeed.  Yet the fact that it fails the smell test doesn't mean it could not happen. Most people will instinctively know that Labour's plan is wrong. But why?  Giving votes in general elections to EU residents would be a bad idea even if it were reciprocal. But it is not. Last year the European Court of Justice ruled that UK citizens living in France cannot vote even in local elections, let alone national ones.  © Provided by Daily Mail Labour's plan would also be a giant step towards a one-party state. Pictured: Starmer at a pro-EU rally in 2019  That ruling applies to all other EU countries apart from Ireland because it has a century-old reciprocal agreement on voting with Britain.  Why should the UK give votes to EU nationals who live and work here, when Brussels refuses to do the same for British expats in Europe?  A more fundamental reason for rejecting Labour's plan is that voting is the most basic of democratic rights, which ought to be granted only to British citizens with a permanent stake in the future of this country. My Polish daughter-in-law gained UK citizenship, not just by living here for a decade and mastering English, but by demonstrating her knowledge of and commitment to Britain, by – among other things – making a solemn oath of allegiance to the Crown.  To give the vote to foreigners who have done none of this, but merely have 'settled status', is to devalue the very idea of citizenship.  We all loathe the idea of 'health tourists' – visitors who come here only to take advantage of the NHS. So why create 'voting tourists'? As for giving the vote to 16 and 17-year-olds, this preposterous proposal ignores the fact that they are still adolescents and considered insufficiently mature to enjoy many of the rights and freedoms that over-18s enjoy.  We don't allow under-18s to gamble, to buy alcohol or tobacco, or even to have a credit card. In England and Wales, it is not possible to get married until the age of 18.  These and many other legal prohibitions exist because, in law, 16 and 17-year-olds are not adults but children, who need protection and cannot be held fully responsible for their actions.  That is why courts are much more lenient in sentencing minors. By the same token, however, under-18s should not expect to enjoy the same rights as adults. That includes the right to vote.  By dangling this precious right in front of youngsters who cannot yet properly grasp its significance, Sir Keir shows that he cares nothing for their welfare but everything for his own party political interest.  Lowering the voting age is a policy he has inherited from Jeremy Corbyn – the most dangerous man ever to lead a major party in Britain.  And let it never be forgotten that Sir Keir campaigned to put Corbyn into No 10.  It is chilling to imagine the consequences of giving the vote to EU citizens and children. The temptation to promise them favours at the expense of others would be overwhelming.  It's easy to imagine Left-wing politicians lifting border controls to please EU voters. Or wooing teenagers with a bonfire of age restrictions on alcohol, cigarettes, betting and nightclubs.  Britons are rightly proud of having exported liberty under the law to the whole world. But if Labour's rigged the electoral system, it would be a sinister kind of euthanasia for the oldest parliamentary democracy on Earth.  'Dirty and nasty'? The words are yours, Sir Keir."

Some 400,000 people were evacuated in Myanmar and Bangladesh ahead of Cyclone Mocha making landfall, as authorities and aid agencies scrambled to avoid heavy casualties.  ""All communication is still down and people are in trouble because all the roofs are gone,"" said Khine Thu Kha, a spokesman for the Arakan Army, which control swathes of Rakhine state. ""We are using military devices to communicate with them.""  Benjamin Small, a consultant with the United Nations Development Programme, said it was hard to understand the scale of destruction because of ruptured communications in Rakhine.  ""But with reported 250 kph (155 mph) winds making Cyclone Mocha one of the strongest in Myanmar on record and the worrying images online, it's not looking good,"" Small said on his Twitter account.  In 2008, Cyclone Nargis swept across parts of Myanmar with winds of 240 kph (150 mph), killing nearly 140,000 people.  Since a junta topped a democratically elected government two years ago, Myanmar has been plunged into chaos and a resistance movement is fighting the military on various fronts following a crackdown on protests.  A junta spokesperson did not immediately answer a telephone call from Reuters seeking comment.  The military has imposed internet shutdowns across parts of the country, including some areas in Rakhine and neighbouring Chin state, which was also in Cyclone Mocha's path.  ""There is significant overlap between the shutdown areas and the cyclone's path, which is a major concern, as it's hindering efforts to reach people,"" said digital rights activist Htaike Htaike Aung.  In remote and hilly Chin, which has previously seen heavy fighting between the junta and the resistance, the areas the storm swept through is under a communications blackout since the coup, the Chin Human Rights Organization said.  ""We have not yet been able to establish the extent of the devastation,"" said the group's deputy director Salai Za Uk Ling. ""The storm itself is a trigger for more problems as heavy rains continue and landslides and flooding tend to follow.""
