REUTERS/Yves Herman  Tayyip Erdogan's presidential challenger appealed to young Turkish voters on Tuesday to support him in a May 28 election runoff, as he seeks to prevent the president extending his rule of NATO-member Turkey into a third decade.  Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the candidate of a six-party opposition alliance, won 45% support in Sunday's vote while Erdogan got 49.5%, falling just short of the majority needed to avoid a runoff of a vote seen as a referendum on his autocratic rule.  Turkish assets weakened for a second day, especially government and corporate bonds and banking stocks, as investors bet that Erdogan would win another five-year term and continue his unorthodox economic policies.  However, Kilicdaroglu, 74, sought to rally his supporters, many now downcast, putting a positive spin on the outcome.  ""A message of change emerged from the ballot box. Those who want change in this country are now more than those that don't want it,"" Kilicdaroglu said, referring to Erdogan falling short of 50%, in a series of tweets addressed to ""dear young people"".  In a parliamentary election held simultaneously, Erdogan's AK Party and its nationalist and Islamist partners won 322 of 600 seats in the new parliament, achieving a majority that will enable him to argue that voting for him will ensure stability.  'DARK TUNNEL'  Kilicdaroglu appealed to young voters with references to the cost-of-living crisis, which in Turkey has been much exacerbated by Erdogan's insistence on cutting interest rates, causing a sharp slide in the lira and soaring inflation.  ""You don't have enough money for anything,"" he said. ""Your joy of life was taken away. Whereas youth should be free of worry.""  ""You won't get your youth back again. We have 12 days to get out of this dark tunnel...,"" Kilicdaroglu added.  Kilicdaroglu has vowed to revive democracy after years of state repression, return to orthodox economic policies, empower institutions that lost autonomy under Erdogan and rebuild frayed ties with the West.  The vote is being closely followed in Washington, Europe and across the region, where Erdogan has asserted Turkish power. He has also strengthened ties to Russia, putting strain on Ankara's traditional alliance with the United States.  The European Union's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, called on Turkey on Tuesday to fix shortcomings in its election process that were identified by European observers.  In Sunday's presidential vote, nationalist candidate Sinan Ogan came third with 5.2% support and there will be much focus now on how his supporters will vote on May 28.  In a potential boost to Erdogan, Ogan told Reuters in an interview on Monday he would only endorse Kilicdaroglu in the runoff if the latter ruled out any concessions to a pro-Kurdish party, parliament's third largest.  That party, the HDP, backs Kilicdaroglu but is accused of ties to Kurdish militants, which it denies.  Opinion polls had shown Erdogan, 69, trailing Kilicdaroglu, but Sunday's outcome suggested he and his Islamist-rooted AK Party were able to rally conservative voters despite Turkey's economic woes.  Kilicdaroglu and his alliance want to restore a parliamentary system of government and scrap the powerful executive presidency introduced by Erdogan.  The AKP came first in Sunday's parliamentary vote with 267 lawmakers, followed by Kilicdaroglu's secularist CHP on 169 and the pro-Kurdish party on 61.  The prospect of five more years of Erdogan's rule will upset civil rights activists campaigning for reforms to undo the damage they say he has done to Turkey's democracy. He says he respects democracy.  Thousands of political prisoners and activists could be released if the opposition prevails."

The Malaysian ministry has announced that the stranded workers have been hired successfully by a new company that has offered to pay their salaries according to the minimum wage, reports Free Malaysia Today.  ""The human resources minister will give details of their employment soon,"" the source told FMT.  Yesterday, the workers gathered at the Bangladeshi High Commission due to the growing frustration over their woes, says FMT.  Abraham, a spokesman for the workers, revealed that they had not been given jobs upon their arrival in February or paid any allowance in the last four months.  ""They came here and their accommodation is not appropriate. Some of the places they were asked to stay at do not have proper sanitation and facilities. Their situation is very bad.  ""Besides this, they have no jobs, no money, and no food to survive,"" he told FMT.  According to Abraham, as many as 600 Bangladeshi migrant workers came into the country through four companies believing they would get jobs as housekeepers in Genting Highlands.  The Malaysian labour department released a statement saying it would sanction firms and withdraw licences from recruitment agencies involved in hiring migrant workers who found themselves stranded without jobs after arrival. They would also act against recruitment companies that misused government quotas and licences for hiring migrant workers.  Investigation involving companies related to the matter has already begun and the findings will be announced soon."

This is despite council claims that a water leak is “entirely unrelated” to the extra traffic.  Southern Water chief operating officer Bob Collington wrote to Brighton MP Caroline Lucas saying that heavy vehicles “may have played a part” in a mains failure which has blocked Upper North Street for repairs.  However, Brighton and Hove City Council has repeatedly denied that the extra bus traffic caused the damage despite similar leaks popping up on other diversion routes.  In the letter to Ms Lucas, Mr Collington said: “The additional traffic or weight of vehicles coupled with the failing road surface may have played a part in the mains fitting failure, however, this would be difficult to confirm.”  He said Southern Water had worked with the council to agree a longer closure to the road, which The Argus understands has been extended to June 9.  MOST READ:  Repair works on the road were originally scheduled to be done by May 5 but remain unfinished.  The letter also said that between 2019 and 2023 only one leak had previously been reported on the road.  A concerned member of the public said: “Days and days go by with no trucks or workers and there is garbage in some of the holes.  “This has been very disruptive. It’s still a big problem but often there’s no one there.”  Previously, the council said the original water leak had “nothing to do with the recent use of the road as a bus diversion” during the improvement works in Western Road.  The council doubled down on the remarks after a similar leak was spotted on a new diversion route in Montpelier Road, saying the leaks were “entirely unrelated” to the buses.  Services heading eastbound in Western Road are currently being diverted along Montpelier Road and through Seven Dials before returning to their normal routes at Churchill Square.  Brighton and Hove City Council was approached for comment in response to the letter."

Argentina World Cup winner Emiliano Martinez is all set to visit Kolkata in his tour of India in July. It is expected to be a two-day tour from July 4-5. The Aston Villa no.1 remains a major favourite in the city after starring for the Albieceleste at the Qatar World Cup and playing a pivotal role over their win.  Martinez is currently playing for the Villans in the final stretch of their Premier League campaign. Villa are pushing to secure qualification for a European competition next year and the Argentine goalkeeper is focused on ensuring that happens.  Emiliano Martinez to visit Mohun Bagan Club in July  Kolkata giants Mohun Bagan have confirmed that Martinez has promised to visit their club on July 4, as part of his Kolkata tour. The Mariners have managed to secure an agreement with the World Cup-winning goalkeeper to pay them a visit when he arrives at the City of Joy.  In an official statement, Mohun Bagan General Secretary Debashis Dutta confirmed that Martinez will visit the club tent in Maidan, Kolkata on the evening of the 4th of July. Further details of the programme in which the Argentine will be celebrated is going to be revealed in due course.  Martinez will join group of legends who have visited the Mohun Bagan Ground during their tour of Kolkata in the past. The likes of Pele and Diego Maradona both visited the tent in the past and the Mariners have managed another major coup in the World Cup-winning goalkeeper. It is said that Emi will kick his autographed footballs into the gallery as well.  Where else will Martinez visit?  In his promotional visit to India, Martinez will spend two days in Kolkata in July.

Also, he’ll visit Sreebhumi Sporting Club, where a Diego Maradona statue is located at. He could even visit some other famous places in the city, but that is yet to be confirmed.  Martinez was the Golden Glove winner in the 2022 Qatar World Cup, having kept three clean sheets. He also starred in the penalty shootout win against the Netherlands in the quarter-finals, before playing a massive role in the penalty shootout win over France in the final to help Argentina earn their third World Cup."

Photo / Otago Daily Times  The biggest local council drama of the year has come to a surprising end with Gore District Council mayor Ben Bell surviving a vote of no-confidence raised by his councillors.  In fact, in Tuesday’s extraordinary meeting of council, none of the councillors at the table even voted to advance the motion to hold a vote - despite seven of the district’s 10 councillors last week asking Bell to resign.  It was a sudden end to a drama that dates back to last year’s local elections, where tensions between the newly-elected Bell and his chief executive Stephen Parry reportedly started to fray shortly after Bell’s narrow election victory.  Speaking to On the Tiles - Local Edition host Georgina Campbell, NZ Herald reporter Kurt Bayer said that the “extraordinary extraordinary meeting” had a packed public gallery, more media in attendance than usual, and protesters out front in support of Bell, all waiting for the motion to advance to the vote of no confidence.  “When it came to the big motion, there was silence. Nobody wanted to move the motion, and it died a death right there. That resulted in some big cheers from the public gallery and applause, and a pretty relieved-looking Mayor Bell.”  Bayer said that the move wasn’t a total surprise, as the motion was sold as being a symbolic move to try and change the situation and ease the tensions around the council table.  The intense national attention on the council and the town likely led to a change of heart as well.  “The attention was plainly unwarranted by the town. Yesterday and in the days leading up to it, they’ve talked a lot about ‘the Gore Way’. It’s a pretty conservative farming region, mainland types, so they just want to crack on with things and not be in the national headlights where this is played out. It goes against all of that.  “I would say it’s definitely played into things, whether it made them back down from a coup. I think there was a lot of pressure behind the scenes to sort it out.”  One motion to write to Local Government New Zealand and seek support was supported unanimously, but Bayer said that despite the no-confidence motion failing, there are still big questions about what will change with the central frayed relationship.  “One key figure in all of this, the CEO Parry, wasn’t at Tuesday’s meeting,” Bayer said. “That’s the real key one, I think. Parry, who’s been there 20-plus years running that council, he had a six-term mayor, Tracy Hicks, who he had been working with. And then he got this young out-of-towner, 24-year-old, coming in.  “So they have admitted themselves to a very strained relationship, so how they can work together will remain to be seen.”  Listen to the full episode for more about the Gore District Council drama.

Mohammed Ali, 39, woke to “panicked screams” from his girls, aged seven and 12, as robbers burst through his front door with machetes, a meat cleaver and a brick. The HGV driver first saw two of the intruders on the stairs of his semi-detached four-bed home as another held a knife against his daughters’ throats in their living room. And when his son emerged from his upstairs bedroom seconds later, one of the men chilling yelled “Kill him! Kill him!” before advancing towards the 18-year-old. Mohammed said he pushed the lad back into his bedroom and ran to a bathroom, where they took refuge while the robbers hacked at the doors with their machetes. After five minutes, the brutes finally fled the property and stole his white Seat Leon car from his driveway when they found his keys. Mohammed, who didn’t know why his home was targeted, said he had been left “broken” by the incident - adding he felt like he’d “failed” his family. He said: “My daughter said one of them had a knife and he was saying, ‘It’s all your dad’s fault, be f*cking quiet,’ and was putting a knife to her neck. “They all had gloves and everything, but you could see their eyes through the balaclava – and their voice, I could never forget it. “I’ve not slept since. My family is broken. My kids wouldn’t come home. “It was my daughter’s birthday yesterday, and literally everything is spoiled and I don’t know what to do or what to say to them. I feel like I’ve failed them.” Mohammed said he'd gone to bed at 9.30 pm on May 9, leaving his youngest son, who is five, and two daughters watching the TV at their home in Oldham, Grtr. Manchester. His make-up artist wife Michelle Dunkley, 40, had forgotten her keys when she left the house for work in the evening so he’d unlocked the door before heading upstairs. But at 11 pm, he heard one of his daughters utter a high-pitched scream before finding two masked men on the stairs holding metre-long machetes. He said: “It wasn’t a scream where the kids were fighting. This was a panicked scream, a worried scream. I knew as a parent this was not normal. “As I was trying to get down the stairs, I was faced by three guys in balaclavas. Two were on the stairs, one at the bottom, and one had my kids downstairs. “I started screaming: “Get out! Get out!”. They started swearing at me. My son had the room next to the stairs, and when he came out, they said: “Kill him! kill him!” “I pushed him into his room and closed the door, and they started coming up the stairs. I went to the bathroom, which was right behind me. “I was just screaming: “Make sure they don’t get to you!” “They started hacking at the doors with the machetes, and while they were hacking it, the third guy was ransacking my house.” Mohammed said he spent a terrifying five minutes holding the door shut, hoping the men wouldn’t break through. And when he finally realised they had made their way down the stairs, he heard the rev of his car engine and realised they were trying to steal his car. He added: “I was still half asleep. I was dazed and in a panic and I didn’t know if they’d got my son or my other kids downstairs. “Once my car started and they were driving off, I gave chase then went inside and saw my kids were alright.” Mohammed said his children were thankfully unharmed despite their trauma, and besides his vehicle, the men only took a box of his daughter's miniature dolls. But after he shared footage of the robbery on social media, he said another family in nearby Rochdale reported the same gang had attacked them just an hour later. The disturbed dad said he had reported the attack to Greater Manchester Police but didn’t think they were taking the incident seriously. He said: “It’s absolutely disgraceful. I left it with the police. But it’s like they’re not bothered. “They will only take action when someone is seriously hurt or dead but I don’t want that on my conscious.” Greater Manchester Police have been approached for comment."

The country of almost 85 million people holds the unfortunate record of the longest process to join the bloc: 36 years – and counting. No other candidate state in Eastern Europe or the Western Balkans comes even close to matching Turkey's protracted path to EU membership.  In fact, since Turkey submitted its official application on 14 April 1987 to be part of what was then the European Economic Community (EEC), 16 countries have seen their bids green-lighted, making Ankara's omission even more glaring.  After a continued succession of ups and downs, promises and threats, it has become apparent that Turkey's accession is a unique case of policy-making that Brussels has not quite learned how to manage.  From Atatürk to Hallstein  To understand Turkey's EU ambitions, we must go all the way back to the days of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the revolutionary leader who resisted the country's partition in the aftermath of World War I and forced the victorious Allies to negotiate favourable terms under the Treaty of Lausanne.  This paved the way for the proclamation of the Republic of Turkey on 29 October 1923 as a one-party parliamentary system with a president, Atatürk himself, as head of state.  Atatürk then launched an intense and rapid series of reforms to build a modern, Westernised country: in the span of a decade, the newly-formed republic saw the abolition of the Caliphate, the introduction of a Latin-script alphabet, a raft of European-inspired laws, drastic changes in dressing codes and the enactment of secularism in the constitution.  The radical transformation paid off. In 1949, Turkey was among the first countries to join the Council of Europe, the Strasbourg-based human rights organisation. In 1952, it became a member of NATO, the transatlantic military alliance created in direct opposition to the Soviet Union.  Story continues  By then, Ankara had set its sights on the nascent project of European integration in Western Europe. In 1959, the country applied to become an associate member of the European Economic Community (EEC), a request granted four years later.  ""Turkey is part of Europe,"" declared Walter Hallstein, the president of the EEC Commission, while celebrating the signature of the association agreement in September 1963.  ""It is an event without parallel in the history of the influence exerted by European culture and politics. I would even say that we sense in it a certain kinship with the most modern of European developments: the unification of Europe.""  But a first major roadblock was erected in the summer of 1974 when Turkish troops invaded the northern part of Cyprus in response to a coup d'état sponsored by the Greek military junta. The conflict split the island in two, a division that still looms large over Turkey's European dreams.  A long-awaited declaration  Nevertheless, the association agreement provided Ankara with a solid foundation to gradually move forward.  In 1987, Turkey formally submitted its application to join the EEC, then made up of 12 members, including Greece. At the time, Turkey's GDP per capita was $1,700 – a far cry from the over $16,000 in both Germany and France.  The huge economic gap, coupled with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the reunification of Germany and persistently poor relations with Cyprus and Greece, slowed down Ankara's bid.  During this time, Turkey was expected to carry out additional reforms to meet the so-called Copenhagen criteria, the fundamental rules that determine a country's eligibility to join the EU. The criteria, laid down in 1993, impose high standards on democracy, the rule of law, human rights, the protection of minorities and an open market economy.  Mustafa Kemal Atatürk (pictured centre) is considered the founding father of the Republic of Turkey. - AP/AP1932  In the meantime, Brussels offered Ankara an intermediate step in the form of a customs union for the trade of goods other than agriculture, coal and steel, which became fully operational in early 1996.  It wasn't until December 1999 when EU leaders, during a European Council in Helsinki, unanimously declared Turkey a candidate country, opening the door for Ankara to join their ranks on an equal footing.  ""Turkey is a candidate State destined to join the Union on the basis of the same criteria as applied to the other candidate States,"" the leaders wrote in their joint conclusions.  The declaration was not merely rhetorical: it gave Turkey access to millions of EU funds in pre-accession assistance.  The absorption capacity  The 2004 enlargement saw the EU move decisively Eastwards and welcome a total of 10 new members, many of which had been subject to the iron fist of the Soviet Union.  For Ankara, it was an awkward affair: the country had submitted its bid well before any of the newcomers, including Cyprus, and was still waiting for the accession process to kick off.  In 2005, the Council finally adopted the framework for negotiations, a nine-page document peppered with references to the rule of law, the EU's ""absorption capacity,"" the importance of ""good neighbourly relations"" and the possible suspension of talks.  ""The shared objective of the negotiations is accession. These negotiations are an open-ended process, the outcome of which cannot be guaranteed beforehand,"" the document says.  ""If Turkey is not in a position to assume in full all the obligations of membership, it must be ensured that Turkey is fully anchored in the European structures through the strongest possible bond.""  The framework served as the main guidelines for the European Commission, which was tasked with steering the negotiations. The talks are split into 35 chapters, a highly complex undertaking that is meant to perfectly align the candidate with all EU rules.  The chapter on science and research was the first one to be opened in 2006 and was provisionally concluded that very same year. In the decade that followed, Turkey, under the leadership of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, managed to open an additional 15 chapters.  But none were closed.  Total standstill  The 2000s marked a period of impressive economic growth for Turkey: its GDP per capita more than tripled, from $3,100 in 2001 to $10,615 in 2010, while services rapidly expanded thanks to sectors such as transport, tourism and finance, deepening the country's modernisation.  Still, the evolution was not enough to overcome tensions in the Mediterranean and the growing reticence among EU leaders, some of whom began suggesting a full-time membership could be replaced by a ""privileged partnership"" – a big no for Ankara.  ""Between accession and (special) partnership, which Turkey says it does not accept, there is a path of equilibrium that we can find,"" French President Nicolas Sarkozy said in 2011. ""The best way of getting out of what risks being a deadlock is to find a compromise.""  In response to cautionary words coming from Paris, Berlin and Vienna, Erdoğan raised the stakes and said he expected accession to be completed by 2023 to coincide with the republic's 100th anniversary. The migration crisis of 2015-2016 gave Turkey political leverage as the country standing between the bloc and millions of Syrian and Afghan refugees.  But things went sour after the July 2016 coup d'état attempt, a critical episode that led Erdoğan to strengthen his grip on power and consolidate what critics decried as a one-man rule.  In November of that year, Members of the European Parliament approved a resolution blasting the ""disproportionate repressive measures"" introduced under the state of emergency and calling for a ""temporary freeze"" on accession talks.  Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel had a complex relation with Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. - FRITZ REISS/2006 AP  The 2017 referendum to install a unitary presidential system granting the head of state vast executive powers further undermined Ankara's application and fuelled criticism from EU officials and lawmakers, with some even questioning if Turkey could still be considered an eligible candidate according to the Copenhagen criteria.  The fast deterioration culminated in June 2018 when member states put negotiations on hold.  ""The Council notes that Turkey has been moving further away from the European Union,"" said the conclusions from a meeting in June 2018. ""Turkey's accession negotiations have therefore effectively come to a standstill and no further chapters can be considered for opening or closing.""  Since then, progress has been almost non-existent.  Freed from the expectation of having to meet EU standards, Erdoğan has ramped up his denunciations against the West, ordered controversial drilling operations in the Eastern Mediterranean and maintained active ties with Vladimir Putin despite Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.  Ties with Brussels have gone so awry that Turkey, which technically speaking is still a candidate country, is now suspected of helping Russia evade EU sanctions.  The 2022 enlargement report released by the European Commission offered a sombre assessment of where things stand now.  ""The Turkish government has not reversed the negative trend in relation to reform, despite its repeated commitment to EU accession,"" the report reads. ""The EU's serious concerns on the continued deterioration of democracy, the rule of law, fundamental rights and the independence of the judiciary have not been addressed."""

Within a year he was working as translator to elected Socialist President Salvador Allende. In September 1973, 50 years ago, the Chilean military and police, backed by the CIA, conspired to overthrow Allende and establish a brutal military dictatorship that lasted 17 years. Thousands were killed and tortured; tens of thousands were exiled.  The following, excerpted with permission from Cooper’s book “Pinochet and Me: A Chilean Anti-Memoir,” courtesy of Verso Books, details how Cooper was caught in the sweeping violence of the coup, how he survived it and how he escaped Chile eight days later. Truthdig will host a livestream event with Marc Cooper and Suzi Weissman on Wed. May 17 at noon (PDT) — click here for more information.  7 a.m., Tuesday September 11 1973  The fledgling Santiago sun and the transparent sky, the fresh spring chill in the air and the blossoming jacaranda made that Chilean morning glorious. As I stood in the yard of my friend Melvin’s suburban house in Santiago and glanced at the lingering snowcaps on the Andes towering right behind me, as I sucked the fragrant, misty air into my lungs, I resolved I would, from that moment forward, make a sea change in my life. Quit smoking, cut back on drinking, get to bed before 3 a.m. and start rising earlier so as to enjoy more frequently these morning wonders.  I had gotten up early because my Chilean residency visa expired that day and I needed to renew it. For a year now I had been working as a translator to Salvador Allende, and in this capacity I was scheduled to travel with him the next week.  I knew that presidential translator status would afford me little advantage in navigating Santiago’s byzantine bureaucracy. Renewing my visa would still take the entire morning. And getting an Argentine visa so I could travel with Allende to Buenos Aires for the inauguration of the new Argentine president would take the rest of the day. An early start was imperative.  Taxis had become harder to come by as many of the cab companies had joined the work stoppage led by the Truckers’ Association — a group floated with CIA dollars. Retail merchants, doctors, lawyers and almost everyone more elevated than manual workers and farmers had joined the stoppage. In daily entreaties, they pleaded with the armed forces to do away with the popularly-elected President Allende and restore Chile to Business-As-Usual.  Indeed, Chile had already pitched itself into a dizzying dance of chaos and blood. As Allende’s reforms deepened, as he nationalized the American copper mines and the telephone company, as large rural estates were handed over to their sharecroppers, as wages soared and unions gained a voice in national affairs, as rents were lowered and taxes on the rich increased, the political Right and eventually the Center jettisoned their attachment to the rule of law. Opposition groups fielded chain-swinging thugs. Oil pipelines were dynamited. Industrial production was sabotaged. The wealthy hoarded food and other consumer goods and then complained loudly about the resulting shortages.  Just a week previous to this morning, on September 4, the Chilean Left held its last great public gathering to commemorate the third anniversary of Allende’s election. While the president stood granite-faced on a balcony from early afternoon till late at night, more than half a million Chilean workers marched before him, voicing the nearly unanimous chant: “We want guns! We want guns!” It was a horrible, wrenching moment, one permanently seared in my consciousness. Yes, guns. But what guns? From where? My friends and I walked home that evening with a dark foreboding. The end was surely near.  President Allende and General Pinochet, seen together before the coup. Photo by AFP  In the seven days that followed, the Right drew the noose tighter. Commerce and transport ground to a halt. The night before September 11, the transport stoppage had waylaid me and my girlfriend at Melvin’s house. We had gone out as a foursome, wound up snacking at Melvin’s, and got stranded without a way back to my downtown apartment.  My only chance of transportation that morning came from my friends at RadioTaxi 33. Militant revolutionaries, the drivers there had long ago seized the company from its conservative owners and had turned the place into the most efficient cab service in Santiago. And when the drivers weren’t working their shifts, they would volunteer as drivers and messengers for the most powerful workers’ council in Santiago, the Cordon Vicuña McKenna.  After a 45 minute wait on the corner, I became concerned. I went back to the house to call the cab company again but, inexplicably, the phone lines were now permanently busy. I walked back to the corner and eventually was able to flag down a passing cab.  The driver, pale and harried, rolled down the window. “Can you take me downtown?” I asked.  “Downtown?”  “Yeah, to the immigration office,” I answered.  With a classic Chilean understatement, the cabbie replied: “But, sir, there are problems downtown.”  “Problems?”  “Yes, problems,” he said, refusing to be more specific. After all, these were highly polarized times. You never knew who you were talking to. One person’s problem was another person’s liberation. But a sinking feeling in my gut told me the worst was upon us.  Mustering my own diplomatic skills, I asked: “Problems, you say? Problems with men in uniform, you mean?”  “Yes, sir, problems with men in uniform,” the cabbie said. But now, the fear of the future already imprinted on him, he took what he probably knew would be his last foray into freedom for some time and added: “Yes, the fucking fascists are overthrowing the government.”  7:55 a.m., Tuesday September 11  Everyone else in the house was still asleep. I switched on the massive Grundig radio and waited impatiently for the tubes to heat up. As the audio came alive I turned the dial and confirmed the cabbie’s report: virtually every station was playing the same military march.  I stopped the dial on Radio Corporación, the station of the Socialist party. Allende was speaking, a nervous inflection in his voice. His words made material the nightmares that had haunted us for months: “This is the president of the republic speaking from La Moneda Palace. Confirmed reports indicate that a sector of the navy has isolated and occupied the port city of Valparaiso, which means an uprising against the government is under way…Under these circumstances, I call upon the workers of the country to occupy your workplaces…but I urge you to stay calm…At the moment there have been on extraordinary troop movements in the capital…I am here defending the government that represents the will of the people…”  On just about every other radio station a stern-voiced announcer suddenly materialized. By order of the military junta, he said, all stations were immediately to link up to the armed forces network or “they will be bombarded.” The names of the four commanders making up the junta were then read: leading the national police — the carabineros — was a general, César Mendoza, a little-known name; for the air force, Gustavo Leigh; for the navy, Admiral José Merino. But the most important name on the list was Army General Augusto Pinochet. Pinochet, previously Commander of the Central Garrison, had two weeks earlier taken over as Commander-in-Chief, swearing his loyalty to the president he was now trying to overthrow.  Some more Prussian marches. And then another announcement. An ultimatum to Allende. I sat chilled and shaking as I strained to scribble down the text of what a steely voice called Military Communiqué Number 2: “The Moneda Palace must be evacuated before 11 a.m. otherwise it will be attacked by the Chilean air force. The workers must remain in their workplaces and homes as it is strictly prohibited to leave them. If they disobey, they will also be attacked by air and ground forces.”  I sat paralyzed. A few moments later the same dry baritone voice read out Communique Number 3. Again I noted it on a yellow pad. “The population is hereby warned not to let themselves be carried away by incitements to violence from either foreign or national activists. And let the foreign ones know that in this country we do not accept violent attitudes or extreme positions. This should be remembered, as means are adopted for their rapid deportation from the country. Any resistance will be met with the full rigor of military justice.”  Yet another announcement proclaimed a curfew “until further notice.” Anyone found on the streets “will be shot on sight.” I had roused the others in the house. We sat dumbfounded in the chilly living room listening to Radio Magallanes, the Communist party station, boldly resisting the order to broadcast the armed forces network. Over the air, workers were being urged to report to their factories and organize defense committees.  But we knew this was an empty gesture. Those of us who worked in the Allende government knew the sad truth: that in spite of the right-wing chorus that Allende had formed a “parallel army,” no such units existed. Allende had been scrupulous in his commitment to the constitutional, legal and peaceful transition to socialism. The only guns in the country, he vowed, would remain in the hands of the armed forces. Yes, some Socialists and others had formed clandestine militias — but they were operationally risible.  This war was going to be a short, one-sided massacre. And the tragic irony was that those conservative and centrist political forces that for 150 years had defended a constitutional system as long as it served their interests were now rebelling against it. The last man standing in defense of the “bourgeois” constitution would be the Marxist President, AK-47 in hand.  10 a.m., Tuesday September 11  Miraculously, my first attempt to phone the office where I worked in the Moneda Palace went through. Over the sound of crackling gun fire, a secretary, Ximena, told me in tears that she and the others were about to flee the building. My next call was to the U.S. Embassy — up on the 14th floor of an office building diagonally opposite the Moneda. I had had virtually no contact with the embassy and had, in fact, made every effort to steer clear of it. Even my mail was routed to the Canadian Embassy — a government that had shown more sympathy to Allende.  This war was going to be a short, one-sided massacre. And the tragic irony was that those conservative and centrist political forces that for 150 years had defended a constitutional system as long as it served their interests were now rebelling against it.  But I phoned the U.S. Embassy that morning hoping that some safety provisions were being made for resident Americans. I figured it was only a matter of hours before I would be swept up in the military dragnet.  The embassy phone answered on the first ring. An accented English told me that I was speaking with a Chilean employee — always more American than the Americans. When I asked if the embassy had issued any special instructions, my respondent only laughed: “No special orders. Just stay off the streets.” And then with another chuckle she added: “I’m looking out the window now with binoculars. Looks like Mr Allende is finally going to get it.” She hung up.  11 a.m., Tuesday September 11    The leftist Radio Corporación and Radio Portales are off the air. But Salvador Allende’s metallic voice is coming live over Radio Magallanes. Via telephone, from inside the Moneda, with troops and tanks poised outside, with the Air Force Hawker-Hunter jets arming their rockets in readiness, Allende spoke:  This is surely the last opportunity I will have to address you. The air force has bombed the towers of Radio Portales and Corporación. My words are not bitter but they are full of disillusionment. And they will serve as moral sanction for those who have betrayed their oath of loyalty: the soldiers of Chile, the branch commanders…Admiral Merino who has named himself Chief of the Navy. Mr. Mendoza, a slinking general who only yesterday swore his loyalty to the government, has proclaimed himself head of the police… In the face of these events I can only say this to the workers. I will not resign… With my life I will pay for defending the principles dear to our nation… History cannot be stopped by repression or violence… Surely Radio Magallanes will be silenced and with it my voice. But that’s of no importance. You will continue hearing me as I will always be by your side… At least you will remember me as a man with dignity, a man who was always loyal to you. You must know that, sooner rather than later, the grand avenues on which a free people walk will be open and a better society will be at hand… These are my last words…  I sat stunned and devastated. I can only remember the four of us listening and sobbing for I don’t know how long. The fear was palpable. To go into the streets was to risk arrest and execution. We had no access to any information except what the military broadcast over the radio. The phone lines were now dead.  Everything I learned over the previous two years told me that the Chilean Revolution was now dead.  4 p.m., Tuesday September 11  A non-stop cascade of military communiques: that the Moneda had been bombed, that the Allende government was no longer, that all political activity was banned, that a dawn-to-dusk curfew was in effect, that the citizenry should denounce all “suspicious foreigners.” As that first evening enveloped us I felt as if I were already in prison.  I knew I was a prime target: Allende’s translator, an activist in the radical wing of the Socialist party and a foreigner to boot at a moment when all foreigners were ipso facto suspect. I thought of my apartment and cringed, a downtown high-rise located directly across the street — no more than 20 yards — from the new junta headquarters. Régis Debray, the French writer and radical who had spent time with Che Guevara in Bolivia, had lived in my building when Allende first came to power. Other units were rented to exiled guerrillas from Argentina and Uruguay. The building teemed with the international New Left. One room of my apartment was stocked with the cheap editions of political classics and classic fiction made available under Allende. On my studio desk were copies of the work I had translated for Allende. In my top drawer was my passport, a visa to Cuba where I was scheduled to visit with Allende, and to top it all off, a .22 revolver with a couple of boxes of ammunition. On the floor were two radio transceivers that I was repairing for my buddies at Radio Taxi 33. In short, once the troops broke into my apartment, as they undoubtedly would, a warrant would be issued for a 22-year-old American named Marc Cooper.  Tuesday night to Thursday night, September 11 to 13  Those days were passed in the sort of blur produced by a state of deep shock. All that remains now is a kaleidoscope provided with a semblance of meaning by scraps of hurried, sometimes incoherent notes. I know I didn’t sleep that first night. I imagined Allende riddled and bloodied on his office floor. I could see the Moneda reduced to rubble by rockets and fire. The following morning, an official communique announced that Allende had committed suicide.  I knew I was a prime target: Allende’s translator, an activist in the radical wing of the Socialist party and a foreigner to boot at a moment when all foreigners were ipso facto suspect.  The resumption of Chilean TV. A wavering, black-and-white image — now in the annals of history’s infamy — of General Pinochet sitting ramrod straight in the presidential chair, his arms crossed over his chest, Ray-Ban Wayfarers hiding his dulled eyes, his accomplices in the junta standing beside him.  I thought of the poor neighborhoods and factories, now surrounded by vengeful troops. I wondered about my friends: about Vincente and an American named Vince; Ximena, Jorge, Orlando; about the journalists, the coworkers. How many were already dead? How many would I ever see again? How long would it be before the troops came crashing through Melvin’s door to take me away?  I thought of the celebrations no doubt taking place that night in the lush suburbs of Providencia and Las Condes. I listened to the radio and noted down the congratulatory notes pouring in to Pinochet from the Doctors’ Association, the Lawyers’ Guild, the Chamber of Commerce, the Truckers — all the business sectors that had paved the way for the coup.  On Wednesday a statement from the supreme court chief justice, Enrique Urrutia, affirming the court’s “pleasure” with the military takeover. A terse military statement suspending habeas corpus and announcing a declared state of siege. Military communique number 29 dated September 13: “On this date the government junta has decreed the following: the closure of the National Congress and the vacancy of all its parliamentary seats. Signed, the governing junta of the armed forces and carabineros of Chile.”  People lie on the ground after being arrested by the military during the coup against the government of President Salvador Allende in Santiago, Chile. (AP Photo, File)  I winced at what I knew would be the wave of bloodletting, homicide and torture that was about to wash over Chile. I wondered how the hell I was going to get out alive.  I remember getting up at four in the morning and shaving off my beard. I remember opening my wallet and taking out my union card, my Socialist party membership, my ID from the Moneda and setting them ablaze. Those two days after the coup, Wednesday and Thursday, were marked by the sort of looming madness that I imagine accompanies solitary confinement. We had little food in the house. Melvin — a 30-year-old Bronx-born American — had never told me why he was in Chile. I had always assumed he was ducking a drug possession charge coming out of the ’60s. A fervent Allende supporter, and a fervent anticapitalist, he made his living buying and selling on the black market.  The only food in the house was a freezer full of Eskimo pies, several sacks of onions and a case of Pisco liquor. This odd diet, peppered with fear and haunted by uncertainty, drove me into a feverish, swirling retreat. I could barely talk to my Chilean girlfriend — now my wife — Patricia. I slept, I paced, ate ice cream, read Jim Thompson novels, cried and waited either for the curfew to lift or the door to come crashing down. But mostly we sat and listened to the radio. List after list of the wanted: Allende’s cabinet ministers, party activists, union leaders, prominent and not so prominent exiles had their names read over the air and were ordered to surrender at the Ministry of Defense. How they were expected to step out on the curfew-swept streets without being shot was not explained. As every announcement began, I was sure my name would be next.  10am, Friday September 14  Melvin and his girlfriend have drunk themselves into a stupor. As the radio announces that the curfew will be lifted today for five hours, Patricia and I decide we must leave Melvin’s. She had to check on her family. I had to get my passport out of my apartment and figure a way to safety. Two weeks before the coup my former roommate Carlos Luna, an exiled Argentinian guerilla fighter, had shown up at my apartment with a 9mm automatic. “The shit is coming,” he said, pulling the pistol from his jacket. “When it does, I am getting into the Swedish embassy even if I have to shoot my way in.” But I had no such formidable weapon nor such courage. The military had already announced it had put rings of troops around European embassies. I wondered where Carlos was. Was he dead by now?  My impulse to flight was heightened when, during the break in curfew, a client of Melvin’s, a deli owner, came to the house in his 3-cylinder Citroneta. Well-connected to the military, I took his words at face value when he told me matter of factly, “Cooper, you’re fucked. Your apartment has been raided and they’re out looking for you,” I asked him to drive me some­where safe. He refused.  A numbing panic gripped me. For the next four hours I could move, but I had nowhere to go. My apartment had been trashed, I was told, my passport seized, my name was on a wanted list, and the streets were full of soldiers and check­points. The phone started working again. In what must have been the moment of greatest naivety in my adult life, I thought again of the U.S. Embassy. I had an image in my head from Rossellini’s Rome: open City. I could see the grainy black-and-­white footage of Embassy staff cars rushing around the battle-littered streets, their white flags flapping.  I am embarrassed now, years later, to confess that I thought that, given the mounting bloodshed in Chile, the American Embassy on that day would be sending out rescue cars to pick up beleaguered stragglers like myself. I was under no illusions as to where the Embassy was at politically. The Nixon-Kissinger regime had made clear its intention to do away with Allende and it was now three days deep into implementing that goal. But I was deluded enough to think that, in order to avoid the uncomfortable spectacle of American citizens being killed by its new client military dictatorship, the U.S. government might do something to protect us. In this I was entirely wrong.  As the curfew temporarily lifted that Friday I called the U.S. Consulate. Explaining merely that I was an “American student,” that I had done nothing wrong, but that the Chilean Police had raided my apartment and seized my passport, I told the Vice-Consul, Mrs. Tipton, that I needed help. Even as I asked, my heart began to sink. Her husband was the Embassy’s top “polit­ical officer,” tied to the darkest aspects of U.S. policy.  The Nixon-Kissinger regime had made clear its intention to do away with Allende and it was now three days deep into implementing that goal.  “Do you have a U.S. driver’s license?” Mrs. Tipton asked me. “Yes.”  “Good,” the Vice-Consul said. “Don’t bother to come in today because we’re about to close. But come in on Monday. Bring your license and $10 and we ‘II expedite you a new passport. Should take about a week, maybe 10 days.”  Stupefied, I argued with her. But to no avail. No special instructions to U.S. citizens were being offered. “Just stay away from shooting and obey the new authorities,” she said. As far as the Embassy was concerned, my predicament was a simple case of a lost passport.  They certainly knew better. But the political calculation had already been made. It was more important to give political sup­port to the new dictatorship than it was to undermine its credibility by suggesting that American citizens needed protec­tion against it.  Noon, Friday September 14  Turned away by the Embassy, I was now desperate. I rummaged through my mental Rolodex and focused on a long shot. An American friend of mine, an Allendista, had told me some months before that a guy named Dennis Allred, who served as the U.S. Embassy’s Student Affairs Counselor, was a decent man, a closet Allende sympathizer who took secret delight in handing out U.S. scholarships to the most radical of Chilean students. True or not it seemed like the only chance I had.  I phoned the Embassy back. No, I was told, Mr. Allred wasn’t in. But, yes, being a fellow American, I could have his home phone number. “Dennis, you don’t know me,” I told him after he answered his phone. “But I’m an American and I’m in trou­ble. I need … “  “OK,” he said, cutting me short. “I don’t care about the details. If you need a place to stay you’re welcome here. Come now. I’m at Merced 280.”  I thanked him and hung up. Merced 280? That would put him right next door to the heavily guarded U.S. Consulate. Could I get past the troops? Patricia and I hurriedly made a plan. She would catch a bus to her parents’ home but first would swing by my apartment and check its condition. She would call me later at Allred’s. I would walk the seven miles to Allred’s house as I had no ID and buses were being boarded and checked by soldiers.  My clothes were filthy. Melvin, who is 6′ 2″, lent me a pair of pants. I am 5′ 3″. I tucked the bottom of the pants up and pinned them inside with safety pins. He gave me a fresh shirt and I rolled the sleeves up over my wrists. On top of this unlikely outfit I wore my black leather jacket. For three hours I trudged toward Allred’s house, protected only by sunglasses, taking side streets and looking far ahead for any checkpoints.  By 4 o’clock I was on the perimeter of the U.S. Consulate. Neighboring Forestal Park was literally an armed camp. Armored carriers bristled with machine guns and helmeted troops. In front of the Consulate, a few steps from Dennis Allred’s apartment, a company of soldiers lounged on a tank. I could hear my heart beating in my ears. I had no idea what I would tell the soldiers if challenged. I walked straight ahead, my eyes fixed on the door of Allred’s building, my pace steady. Like passing through a time warp, I floated into the building uninterrupted.  A big, red-headed Bostoner, Allred greeted me alone in his luxury apartment. I was so pent up I could hardly talk at first. And then I began to talk too much. “I don’t need to hear the details of your story. You can stay here as long as you have to,”” he said. He then offered me a tumbler full of Old Grandad which I gulped down like water. The booze took the edge off, and I slumped back in the broad padded mahogany chair. I called Patricia at her parents’ house. I was relieved to hear that my apartment had not been raided. She had got in, picked up my passport and a couple hundred dollars, and tossed my .22 and the two boxes of ammo down a garbage chute. She would come and visit me the next day when the curfew was again to be lifted for a short time.  Over a real meal that evening — salad and Kraft macaroni and cheese — Allred told me the news, good and bad. “This apartment theoretically has diplomatic immunity, theoretically Chilean security cannot enter,” he said. “On the other hand, the morning of the coup, the U.S. Embassy took my passport, locked it in a safe, sent me home, and told me they’d call me when I should come back to work. So I don’t know how much protection we really have.” I could only guess that the stories my friend had told me about Allred were true.  She had got in, picked up my passport and a couple hundred dollars, and tossed my .22 and the two boxes of ammo down a garbage chute.  That night, on the convertible bed in his den, the saddest of Portuguese fadas I had fished out of Allred’s record collection drowned the sounds of sporadic gunfire and the rumble of tanks outside my window. With a strong sleeping pill Denis gave me I slept soundly for the first time in almost 100 hours.  6 p.m., Sunday September 16    The word was apparently out on Allred’s generosity. Over the weekend the apartment filled up with other hunted prey. A few had been beaten and bruised by troops who had broken down their doors. Others, like me, had nowhere to go. Still others were there because I had contacted them. Allred had taken the courageous step of abandoning his direct-dial diplomatic phone to us — a luxury in a country where long-distance calls even under optimum circumstances were difficult to make and where now so-called “press-calls” of the sort we were making had to be cleared by a military censor. With Allred’s phone we skipped over those obstacles.  In Allred’s study we set up a mini information clearing house. We called around the city to check on the safety of over­lapping networks of friends and co-workers. Once the information was compiled from a mongrel mix of sources — friends, friendly reporters, diplomats, health workers, UN func­tionaries — we were able to skirt Chilean censorship and pass the information directly on to family, media and human rights groups in the U.S. Painstakingly, we cobbled together lists of those safe, those arrested, and those simply missing. But there was still no way out of Chile. The airports were closed, the embassies sealed. Any foreigner on the street was ipso facto a sus­pect. Who knew who was on the myriad wanted, arrest and kill-on-sight lists? We already knew the U.S. Embassy was useless.  A friend of mine, a Mexican reporter, called me from his Embassy. Would I be interested in getting on a list that the Mexican Embassy was putting together to be evacuated? “Absolutely,” I answered. I gave him the names of three or four other desperate friends. He told me to sit tight and wait, that word of the flight out could come at any time. I had no choice but to comply.  A few friends who had come to see me at Allred’s told tales of serious resistance, of a regrouping of Allende forces, of guns that were on their way, of former Army General Carlos Prats, forced from office a few weeks before the coup, who was now pulling together a People’s Army. The rumors all sounded wonderful. And we knew they were all false. The Chilean armed forces, the CIA, Nixon, Kissinger, the Chilean business elite had won their victory early that first morning when the Army didn’t divide and when Allende perished inside the Moneda. Now they were just mopping up the rest of us.  Noon, Monday September 17  Word had come that some Americans were missing. David Hathaway had been taken from his apartment. Frank Teruggi was unaccounted for. Sometime that day, our friend Charlie Horman would be seized.  During my time in Chile I had only limited contact with the American expatriate radical community. Some of them had come together in a group called Fuente de Informaci6n Norteamericana (FIN), which struggled to gain a voice as an alternative source of information on Chile to the mainstream media. I had no participation in that project but, for a short time shortly after I arrived in Santiago, I spent a string of Saturday mornings in a “study group” with Frank Teruggi and others. I soon tired of those meetings and what seemed to me at the time their uncritical attachment to the MIR. But I always thought fondly of the spry and witty Teruggi, who was clearly the brightest among his friends.  I had first met Charlie Horman only recently. One after­noon he showed up unannounced at my apartment door and introduced himself as a friend of some of my friends. That was sufficient basis for us, fueled by a couple of liters of rich Chilean red wine, to talk of politics and life deep into the night. We had a few other sporadic lunches and chats.  Now I can only regret that I did not spend more time with Charlie and Frank. I would next see them a decade later and then only as celluloid ghosts conjured up in the Costa-Gavras film “Missing.”  One young American professor rallied us in Allred’s living room and we went as a delegation next door to speak to the U.S. Consul. Enough was enough, we shouted. We wanted the U.S. Embassy to do everything it could to find those who had been arrested. And we wanted protection for ourselves. We wanted the Americans to do what every other diplomatic delegation was doing in Chile — protecting its own citizens from a rampag­ing, barbarous military. The Consul, Frank Purdy, stood in the hall, blocking access to his office. He spouted the party line: he would look into these matters but there was nothing else to be done that day. The State Department had still issued no specific instructions for Americans in Chile. No special protection was to be extended.  “I recommend you be careful,”” Consul Purdy said. And then he looked us in the eye and came up with a straight-out lie. “The armed forces are restoring order but there’s still a danger of scattered left-wing snipers. Be careful.” With that he shooed us out of the Consulate. In retrospect we made mistakes. Our disgust with our government kept us from making what should have been the next logical move. We should have sat down and occupied the Consulate.  That afternoon, shortly after we slumped back from the meeting with the Consul, the whole apartment shook with a thud. Then another bone-chilling thud. Walking out onto Allred’s second-floor balcony we saw the two tanks that were doing the shelling. Comfortably squatting in the park, they lobbed artillery rounds into the Fine Arts Campus of the University of Chile across the river. That’s how the armed forces of Chile were restoring order.  8 p.m., Tuesday September 18  One week since the coup, and the call came through from the Mexicans. Thanks to the Mexican government I was to be on a flight organized by the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees for the next morning. Apart from a special military aircraft that carried Allende’s widow to Mexico, this would be the first flight allowed out of Chile. There was a catch, of course. I had to be at the distant Sheraton Hotel the next morn­ing at 7:30 sharp. But curfew didn’t lift till 7. It was going to be tight. Nor could I get word to Patricia to meet me to say good­bye. She used a neighbor’s phone and if I called her now, at night, it would be too dangerous to defy the curfew. I’d have to wait till morning to call. This was another low point. The mix of emotion I felt was paralyzing. I was ecstatic at the thought I might get out the next day, but terrified that something might go wrong. I was also deeply depressed, laden with survivor’s guilt: my only prospect for joy was to flee the slaughterhouse of my friends.  7 a.m., Wednesday September 19  The moment the curfew lifted, I called Patricia and asked her to do what she could to meet me at the Sheraton. I hugged Allred goodbye. With only my passport, $200 in cash and the borrowed clothes on my back, I walked past the encampment of soldiers outside Allred’s door. On the corner, a daring taxi driver was ready for the post-curfew fares. When we got to the Sheraton, I began to reach into my pocket to pay him. The cabbie turned around and commenced one of those skilfully coded dialogues.  “Are you a foreigner?” he asked.  “Yes, an American.”  “Have you been living in Chile?” he asked, noting my local accent.  “Yes, for nearly three years.”  “Are you leaving today?”  “Yes. I am leaving.”  “Then,” the cabbie said, “there will be no charge. I want your thoughts about your last moments in Chile to be positive ones.”  Operating on an emotional hair-trigger, I couldn’t answer through my tears. I only nodded.  Inside the Sheraton lobby I was met by UN and Mexican officials. There was to be a motley mix of about 50 of us on this flight. Few of us knew each other. There were some Spanish clergy. Some Mexican teachers. An American researcher black and blue from a beating. A Texas high-school swim team that had had the bad luck to be passing through Santiago on the wrong day. Because Americans were on the flight manifest, American consular officials were there with clipboards in hand. We refused to talk to them.  The mix of emotion I felt was paralyzing. I was ecstatic at the thought I might get out the next day, but terrified that something might go wrong. I was also deeply depressed, laden with survivor’s guilt: my only prospect for joy was to flee the slaughterhouse of my friends.  Just before I boarded the bus to the airport Patricia arrived for a short goodbye — she would arrange to meet me later in the U.S. Under heavily armed military escort we were taken to the Cerrillos military airport. After bureaucratic stalling by the junta’s new immigration officers, who challenged the validity of our UN-secured safe-conduct pass, we were herded onto a cor­porate 737 owned by LADECO, one of the copper companies nationalized by Allende.  There was an eerie silence as we took off. No one was sure of anyone else on the flight. As we gained altitude, the plane banked around and began to cross the majestic, snow-sparkled Andes en route to Buenos Aires. Twenty minutes into the flight a crackling voice came over the intercom. “Ladies and gentle­men,” the captain announced crisply, “we have just entered Argentine air space.”  The entire plane exploded into yelps of joy and applause. Soon we were all on our feet embracing each other, even the Texas swim team. The Kool-Aid and baloney sandwiches that were served remain to this day the best airplane meal I’ve ever had.  We were greeted in Buenos Aires as heroes even by the immigration police. And that night we marched with 100,000 Argentines to protest the Chilean military dictatorship.  The following week Patricia called me to tell me that on September 22 she went by my apartment and found the front door blown off its hinges, the entire residence sacked by sol­diers.  Two months afterwards she came to the U.S. and we have been married ever since. Dennis Allred resigned from the U.S. Foreign Service. Ten years later when I passed through Sweden I found my old guerrilla roommate Carlos Luna running an import-export business with Cuba.  In his final speech on Magallanes Radio, Salvador Allende promised us that one day there would be a “moral punishment” for the crime and treason that killed him and his Chile. We are still waiting.  Of Salvador Allende, his sacrifice and legacy, Gabriel Garcia Marquez lamented: “His greatest virtue was following through, but fate could only grant him that rare and tragic greatness of dying in armed defense of the whole moth-eaten paraphernalia of an execrable system which he proposed abolishing without a shot.”  Extracted from “Pinochet and Me: A Chilean Anti-Memoir” by Marc Cooper, published by Verso Books.  Author’s note: Diplomat Dennis Allred left the foreign service after the coup in Chile. He moved to Chicago and later to Brazil. He died in 1990 at age 45 from alcohol-related diseases."

The party at a meeting with some of its candidates in the last general elections, said that a legal team had offered to render services to candidates who felt cheated following the outcome of the Feb. 25 and March 18 general elections in the state.  The Lagos State LP Chairperson, Pastor Dayo Ekong, disclosed this while addressing the frontline candidates and other critical stakeholders at the party’s Secretariat in Ikeja on Tuesday evening in Lagos.  “We have a group of professionals and lawyers who want to volunteer their services for free to help our candidates retrieve their stolen mandates.  “Feel free to contact them in case you need legal advice. We are hopeful that legal practitioners will help those who do not have money to hire lawyers to fight their cases in court.  “All eyes are on the judiciary. We are going to win,” Ekong said.  The chairperson expressed optimism that the party would recover allegedly stolen mandates.  “This is the time for us to stand strong, tall and stay focused no matter the attacks and intimidation.  “We are with you. We want to feel more of you, we want you to support us and together we can move this party forward,” she said  Ekong assured that the state exco would continue to stand behind all candidates challenging the outcome of the last general elections.  According to her, the leadership challenges rocking the party will fizzle out very soon, as the party has commenced processes to expose and show the infiltrators the way out.  “We cannot allow people who are playing the script of some paymasters in our midst to continue. Our children must grow up to see a new Nigeria and that is our passion and commitment.  “Be part of the history, fight the battle no matter the castigation and intimidation. If our country is better, our children will sing a new song,” she added.  According to her, the chapter is solidly behind the Julius Abure-led National Working Committee and would not be part of any back-door coup against the party leadership for any monetary gain.  Urging the candidates not to be distracted but to be focused, Ekong assured them that the truth would prevail at the end of the tunnel.  She urged all the candidates to be closer to the party hierarchy in the state.  “We are at a period in this party when everything looks uncertain because of infiltrations,” she said.  She begged all aggrieved candidates to shelve their grievances and work to promote the party and its ideas in their various constituencies.  Corroborating the chairperson, the LP Secretary in the state, Chief Sam Okpala, said that some people had become ‘comrades in crimes’ to destroy the party and its structure in the state because of selfish gains.  “We need your support to stand and face the shenanigans who are hell-bent to destroy the party. They are out to play the spoiler’s role but God will continue to expose them.  “The party is standing strongly with you in the efforts to reclaim these mandates. We want you to help defend the interests and cause of this party in your various constituencies.  “We have almost 20 lawyers working together with some other professionals working together on this,” Okpala said.  Stating that the Lagos State LP chapter remained the bedrock of the party, Okpala described the interaction as a confidence-building meeting to clear airs on myriads of false narratives making the round about the party.  Commenting, the candidates and leaders of the party unanimously agreed to work with the party and Ekong-led state executive committee of the party.  The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the meeting had in attendance some House of Assembly, House of Representatives and Senatorial District candidates of the party in the last general elections with other stakeholders in the state.

Brian Cox pointed out to me that there’s a lot of Henry IV parts one and two in there, given the way Logan distrusts the focus of the generation below him (Kendall’s obsession with looking cool makes him a good analog to Prince Hal). In Shiv and Tom you can probably read into some sort of Macbeth dynamic (who is Lady Macbeth? Depends on the episode) and Greg is, of course, a great Fool, kept around in the court for wasabi-based jests and japes. But as the series heads toward its endgame, watching Sunday night’s election episode, the finale of another big Shakespeare tragedy kept coming to mind: Hamlet.  There’s some resemblance in the plot of that play to what’s currently transpiring with the GoJo deal — squint hard and Kendall’s equivocations about whether to commit to throwing his support behind Mencken and stopping the deal with Mattson are a bit like Hamlet trying to decide whether to kill his usurper uncle. But what’s really interesting is how Hamlet ends, which might provide a glimpse into how Succession unravels. After almost everyone in Elsinore kills each other, the militant prince of Norway, Fortinbras, arrives and claims the castle for himself. Hamlet, right before he dies, lends his support to Fortinbras, saying, “He has my dying voice” (it’s right before the whole “the rest is silence” bit), and Fortinbras then delivers the customary return-to-order speech at the end of the play, announcing that he’s going to give Hamlet a soldier’s burial with “the rites of war.”  It’s an ironic end for Hamlet, considering his whole problem is that he’s bad at taking action, but it tracks with the fact that Hamlet’s had a bit of a crush on Fortinbras from a distance (not unlike Roman Roy and Jeryd Mencken) for the whole play. He’s obsessed with the fact that the Norwegian prince is spending his time marching armies into Poland while he waffles about whether to kill his uncle or not — never mind the fact that Hamlet’s dad (named Hamlet) killed Fortinbras’s dad (also called Fortinbras). If you’re directing Hamlet, you can take that dynamic in all sorts of directions, casting Fortinbras’s crowning at the end as rightful or a coup. Robert Icke’s production at the Armory last summer had recorded cable-TV footage of Fortinbras, played by Starstruck’s Nikesh Patel, leading an invasion. In this way, Hamlet’s dithering leads to his kingdom, already in dire straights, being subsumed by fascism.  That brings us back to our pals in the court of the Roy family. At the end of Sunday night’s Succession, we have Jeryd Mencken — call him “far-right-inbras” — giving his speech on TV about purifying America while Shiv, Roy, and Kendall are at each other’s throats about the fate of Waystar, which is already floundering. Kendall, Succession’s most melancholy prince, goes along with the idea that Mencken is the one to support, simply because he convinces himself it will be possible to do business with him — not unlike going, “Hey, well, at least this guy is also a Scandinavian prince.” Extrapolating forward into the last two episodes, it seems quite plausible that, instead of any one of the Roy children ending up in charge of the company, the three of them destroy each other and then hand over the actual power to outside invaders.  Speaking of which, we should acknowledge the actual six-foot-four-inch Scandinavian prince in the room: Lukas Mattson, who is also watching things from the sidelines, an old (sort of) foe of the Roys’ father. Really, we should have seen a Fortinbras-style ending coming with a character like him from the moment everyone started talking about how their media empire was losing the battle to tech back in season one. Mattson’s numbers in India are probably fake, but in terms of deportment, he’s everything the Roy children are not: decisive, canny, an actual killer. As much as Kendall and Roman think they might be able to use Mencken to stop the GoJo acquisition, or even reverse the flow and swallow the tech giant back (good luck with that), if we’re looking to Hamlet as a model, all the internal conflict between the family will just make it easier, in the end, for Mattson to sweep in and take control without expending much blood of his own (except for the bricks he’s already FedExed to Ebba). Maybe he’ll even be nice and give a little speech about how noble and soldierly the Roy children were right at the end of the show. If that happens, tallying up the numbers, Succession will end up having two Fortinbrases, three Hamlets, and one Yorick (Karl)."

External analysis of Turkish politics often tends to focus on the divide between political Islamism and secularism, between liberals and conservatives.  But looking at Turkish politics today, there is one ideology that is represented across the board: nationalism.  Nationalists, in the form of the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) and its leader Devlet Bahceli, are the main allies of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.  Former MHP members who split with the party over its support for Erdogan went on to form the Iyi Party in 2017, now a key part of the opposition alliance.  Another ex-MHP member, Sinan Ogan, has been labelled as the “kingmaker” ahead of the presidential run-off scheduled for May 28 after he surprisingly won more than 5 percent in the first round of presidential elections on Sunday.  And then there are nationalists of a different flavour – left-wing Kurdish nationalists of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP), who fought the election under the banner of the Yesil Sol Party.  Even before Ogan’s emergence, the presence of Turkish nationalists at the centre of the two main alliances that fought the elections has allowed the ideology to have a greater effect on both sides of the debate.  It has led to a harder push from both sides to resolve the issue of approximately 3.7 million Syrian refugees living in Turkey — with both Erdogan and his opponent in the presidential run-off, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, tacking to the right on the issue in the past year.  A combination of anti-refugee sentiment and economic hardships has even led to pressure on politicians to send Syrians back to their home country, despite the ongoing rule there of President Bashar al-Assad, and even a spike in violence towards people perceived to be Syrian.  Turkish nationalists have also been able to seize on those same economic problems to foment xenophobic attitudes towards other refugee and migrant populations, and anti-Arab attitudes are also on the rise, both on the left and the right.  Ogan himself has already referenced “terrorism” as a red line for his support in the second round – a clear reference to Kurdish groups. While Erdogan’s AK Party included politicians from the predominantly Kurdish Huda-Par Islamist party in its parliamentary candidate lists, this will be more of a problem for Kilicdaroglu, who received a huge amount of support from HDP voters and will struggle to win over Ogan voters without losing Kurdish support.      Islamic movement replaced by nationalism?  Turkish nationalism has always been present in the post-Ottoman Republic of Turkey but really gained its own distinct path after the emergence of former army colonel Alparslan Turkes in the 1960s.  Turkes founded the MHP, which, along with its paramilitary organisation, the Grey Wolves, fought leftist groups in the 1970s. The Grey Wolves has gone on to be designated a “terrorist” group in Kazakhstan and banned in France, with calls for a “terrorist” designation to also be applied in the wider European Union and the United States. The Turkish government has denied the group’s existence.  While the MHP has moderated under Bahceli, it is still considered to be a hardline nationalist movement, the presence of which has pushed the Turkish government further to the right.  This was not always the case – the MHP opposed Erdogan’s peace process with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) in the early 2010s.  But from 2015 onwards, once the peace process broke down, and particularly after the failed coup against Erdogan in 2016, the MHP became a firm ally.  In that sense, the MHP replaced the group that has largely been blamed for the coup, the Gulenists – who were once Erdogan’s close partners.  Bahceli has replaced figures like former president Abdullah Gul and former prime minister Ahmet Davutoglu, men who were pivotal in Erdogan’s rise but who eventually split with him.  Davutoglu himself was famous for his “zero problems with neighbours” foreign policy. The Arab Spring, and a desire to support groups with a background in political Islam, such as Ennahdha in Tunisia and the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, ended that.  But the growth in power of the nationalist narrative also contributed to Turkey entrenching itself militarily fighting the PKK and its affiliates in Syria and Iraq, while a desire to project Turkish power has also seen disputes emerge outside of the Middle East, most notably in the eastern Mediterranean.  It all means that while Erdogan’s roots in political Islam can never be discounted and continue to be attractive to domestic conservatives, Turkish nationalism is arguably the stronger ideology within the Turkish government and will continue to be going forward.      What comes next?  Erdogan is now expected to win the run-off against Kilicdaroglu on May 28, having defied the expectations of the pollsters to emerge within a percentage point of winning the presidential election in the first round outright.  But the Turkish leader, who has led the country for 20 years, will turn 70 next year and will be 74 at the time of the next presidential election in 2028. Thoughts will surely be turning to who his successor will be.  It is a big problem for the AK Party, which appears rudderless without Erdogan. While his popularity has generally held steady, the party’s has dipped, shedding voters to nationalist parties.  Within the party, no one has Erdogan’s gravitas or popularity.  Some analysts predict that this means that the path will open for a member of the Republican People’s Party (CHP), perhaps someone like Istanbul’s mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, and that Erdogan’s successor will come from the left.  But it is Turkish nationalism that is on the ascendancy, in both the government and opposition camps, which makes it more likely that successor will emerge from the right."

Six Opposition parties came together to seize the momentum and fielded a joint candidate, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, a mild-mannered former bureaucrat who promised to arrest Turkey’s “slide towards authoritarianism” and fix its economy. Most opinion polls predicted that Mr. Erdoğan was trailing Mr. Kılıçdaroğlu. Yet, in the preliminary results, Mr. Erdoğan won 49.5% of the votes in the presidential election, a tad lower than the threshold that would have avoided a run-off, against Mr. Kılıçdaroğlu’s 44.9%. The President’s nationalist-conservative coalition also took a comfortable majority in Parliament. Mr. Erdoğan was facing serious criticism, particularly about his mismanagement of the economy. Turkey’s lira has lost some 60% of its value against the dollar in just two years. Foreign investors are fleeing and the current account deficit is ballooning. Annual inflation has hit the middle-class. After a devastating earthquake in February, the government’s response to the calamity and its building permit rules were slammed. Yet, the Opposition failed to turn these challenges Mr. Erdoğan faced into votes.  Mr. Erdoğan, whose Islamist Justice and Development Party (AKP) came to power in 2003, has remained a towering figure in Turkey’s politics. He rewrote its Constitution, turning its parliamentary system into an executive presidency, and got himself elected as the first President under the new Constitution. He used the failed 2016 coup to purge his rivals and tame the generals. He moved Turkey away from the western orbit and began building stronger ties with Russia and Arab countries, while retaining its NATO membership. His promise was to turn Turkey, once the core of the Ottoman Empire, into a major global power again. He presented himself as an outsider who revolted against the Kemalist establishment, and built a new order rooted in Islamist conservatism, public welfare and an Ottoman imperial nostalgia. Sunday’s election results show that this revivalist brand of politics still remains powerful. But that is not the whole story. The results also suggest that there are cracks in his base. In 2018, he won the presidential election in the first round with a 22-percentage point lead over his closest rival. This time, he was not just forced to go into a run-off, but the gap is just five points. Public resentment towards his policies was particularly high in and around Ankara and Istanbul. A directionless Opposition finally seems united and potent. Mr. Erdoğan may still be in the lead, but he has been humbled by Turkey’s voters."

Enter Daw Khine Zaw, chief executive officer of the Earth Group Companies. She is a sister-in-law of arch-crony and major arms dealer U Tay Za, the chairman of the Htoo Group of Companies.  Daw Khine Zaw has been involved in military-linked businesses since the days of former military dictator Than Shwe. She also has ties with current junta chief Min Aung Hlaing and his relatives.  According to The Irrawaddy’s business sources, it was Daw Khine Zaw who sold Min Aung Hlaing on the idea of promoting the use of EVs, including electric buses, in Myanmar. She has already been engaged in the renewable energy business, including solar power, for several years.  One Yangon car dealer told The Irrawaddy: “Daw Khine Zaw’s Prime Company alone is handling EVs. She has connections and she has won most of the licenses related to EVs.”  Prime Automotive Myanmar, a subsidiary of Daw Khine Zaw’s Earth Renewable Energy, is licensed to import EVs, while Earth Renewable Energy is licensed to build charging stations for them.  Under the now ousted National League for Democracy government, Daw Khine Zaw rarely appeared at the meetings of the Union of Myanmar Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry (UMFCCI). But since 2022, she has appeared at UMFCCI and is mainly engaged in solar power and EVs, added the car dealer.  While there is still no necessary infrastructure and facilities for EVs, the military regime formed a national-level committee on EVs and related businesses in June 2022, and took immediate steps to import electric cars and build charging stations.  The junta has also waived the tax on the import of EVs and parts for charging stations for the 2022-23 fiscal year. There are also reports that the tax will be exempted until the end of the 2024-25 fiscal year. Daw Khine Zaw’s companies are enjoying tax exemptions, too, according to automobile dealers.  This March, Earth Renewable Energy opened Myanmar’s first charging station for electric buses on the Yangon-Naypyitaw-Mandalay Highway in Naypyitaw’s Dekkhinathiri Township. So far it has built three charging stations along the highway, according to the company.  Traditionally, foreign automakers distribute their cars through authorized dealers in Myanmar. Prime Automotive Myanmar Co has, however, attempted to import vehicles directly from foreign companies, resulting in disputes with local dealers.  The Yangon car dealer said: “They reached out to foreign car companies and asked them to sell branded vehicles, saying they have the permits [to import].”  Who is Daw Khine Zaw?  Daw Khine Zaw is the sister of Daw Thida Zaw, the wife of arch-crony U Tay Za. The 60-year-old businesswoman engages in around five industries including manufacturing, transportation, and renewable energy.  She won the Association of Southeast Asian Nations 2019 Women Entrepreneur of the Year award. She is also a vice chair of the Myanmar Industries Association, which is a sister association of the UMFCCI.  Over the past decade Daw Khine Zaw has portrayed herself as a female entrepreneur to boost her image among international business owners, despite her ties to the former and current military regime. She is also close to people who move in political circles in Thailand.  Daw Khine Zaw has previously won licenses for construction projects in the Myanmar capital Naypyitaw that were backed by former generals. The most notable tender was to construct solar-powered lighting along the Yangon-Naypyitaw-Mandalay highway. The tender was worth billions of kyats, but the lighting failed within a few years because it was of poor quality.  She is also a laywoman of Sitagu Sayadaw, a military-linked Buddhist monk who is close to Min Aung Hlaing. The monk served as the vice-chair of ultranationalist Buddhist group The Association for Protection of Race and Religion, better known by the Burmese acronym Ma Ba Tha.  The group has become known for racial and religious hate speeches since it was established in 2013, some two years after Min Aung Hlaing succeeded Than Shwe as Myanmar military chief."

Netanyahu is now trapped between his need and desire to kill Justice Minister Yariv Levin’s poisonous legal upheaval and his inability to publicly announce its demise. So meanwhile, he’s handing out money to the settlers and the ultra-Orthodox, who are raiding the public coffers even as average Israelis are being hammered by rising inflation.  'When Trump said F**K Bibi, it wasn't a slip of the tongue' Subscribe 0:00 -- : -- 15 Skip 15 seconds backwards Play audio 15 Skip 15 seconds ahead 1 X Change playback rate from 1 to 1 Mute audio  The story of the arnona (property tax) fund – a proposal to have wealthy towns allocate a portion of their property taxes to a fund that would benefit poorer communities – took over the battle between the blocs this week. But it also includes two political stories whose implications are greater than they seem.  The first is the divorce between Haim Bibas – mayor of Modi’in-Maccabim-Re’ut, chairman of the Federation of Local Authorities and someone the Likud party marked as potential leadership material some years ago – and Netanyahu’s Likud.  This isn’t the first time Bibas has dared to come out against Netanyahu from his position of power as local authorities leader. He criticized the prime minister during the coronavirus pandemic, he opposed giving homophobe Avi Maoz some of the Education Ministry’s powers, and he bravely spoke out against the government’s destructive efforts to enact its legal coup. But his battle against the arnona fund seems likely to be the straw that breaks the camel’s back.  The fault line emerged when Bibas and his fellow big-city mayors discovered that Likud MKs who had supported their position in the Knesset Finance Committee were nevertheless obliged to vote for the bill – because the prime minister was enforcing coalition discipline. People close to Bibas say that contrary to the Finance Ministry’s claims, Bibas never agreed to any compromise on this issue. That’s because he views the fund as harming big-city residents by nationalizing their money, and the “negotiations” as having been forced on the cities by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Knesset Finance Committee chairman Moshe Gafni.  We lost Bibas  “Bibas is no longer with us,” one Likud minister said. “We realized this during the story of the [legal] reform, and now it’s already public. This isn’t just a fight with Netanyahu; the biggest heartbreak is his rift with Yariv Levin. They were brothers, cornerstones of the Likud branch in Modi’in. But today, when you’re against Netanyahu and Levin, Likud is scorched earth for you.”  People close to Bibas also realize that Netanyahu is likely to oust him from his position as chairman of Likud’s municipalities committee – a group with a strong foothold among the grassroots that will be of great importance in the upcoming municipal elections.  During the crisis over the arnona fund, Bibas’ associates said, many attempts to silence him were made, but he is willing to pay any political price, including “being burned with the [Likud] base,” to defend the interests of the city residents he represents.  Yet it’s not at all clear that Bibas will be the big loser in this story. Several centrist parties will likely propose that he run on their ticket in the municipal elections – Benny Gantz’s National Unity Party, Yair Lapid’s Yesh Atid, Naftali Bennett’s expected new party and who knows what others may arise. Some of the above are already courting him.  Open gallery view Modi'in Mayor Haim Bibas. Credit: Jorge Novominsky  But the prevailing political wisdom is that he won’t enter national politics as long as Netanyahu is around. “Bibas is the archetype of what Likud should be – Mizrahi, born in Beit She’an, right-wing, social-welfare-oriented and liberal,” one prominent rightist said. “For Likud to sacrifice him, an act that looks like caving in to Gafni and Smotrich, is a mistake.”  The second story, which was bolstered by the arnona fund, is the ultra-Orthodox community’s blindness about its situation and insistence on making itself hated, to the point that its exclusion from the next governing coalition will become genuinely essential.  The arnona fund wasn’t created solely to benefit the Haredim, but it will benefit most of their towns, at the expense of the wealthiest cities. Coming on top of the scandalous coalition funding (money earmarked for the pet projects of coalition parties and MKs), and given that Gafni, of United Torah Judaism party, was a key player in creating the fund, the proposal looks like another aggressive, avaricious act by the ultra-Orthodox.

Credit: Olivier Fitoussi  “There are no greater extorters than the Haredim. They are never satisfied, they always ask for more and more until you tell them ‘enough,’ and even that isn’t enough. They are taking this situation to the extreme, and they will also pay the price.”  Those comments didn’t come from a center-left politician like Lapid or Labor MK Gilad Kariv, but from a Likud minister. In short, the ultra-Orthodox have managed to annoy everybody except themselves."

Starting in November 2010, the Doha Talks was a process of intermittent negotiations between the United States and the Afghan Taliban. The culmination of this process was the Doha Agreement, signed in February 2020. The agreement facilitated the withdrawal of US and NATO troops from Afghanistan.  The Geneva talks  However, about three decades earlier, the US government had also played a pivotal role in another peace process on Afghanistan — Geneva Talks. The outcome of the latter talks was the Geneva Accords which facilitated the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan in February 1989.  The Geneva Talks took place in the background of a military occupation of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union. In late December 1979, tens of thousands of Soviet troops invaded Afghanistan to prop up a client regime in Kabul. The regime — also known as the Afghan Communist regime — had been established a year earlier following a military coup in April 1978. Ever since its establishment the Communist regime faced an armed resistance from anti-Communist resistance fighters — Mujahideen. At the time, the United States along with neighboring Pakistan supported the Mujahideen.  The Soviet Union claimed that it had deployed its forces in Afghanistan at the request of the Afghan government to fend off the threat from the Mujahideen. The United States refuted the Soviet claim. According to American President Jimmy Carter, the Soviet Union had occupied Afghanistan as part of an expansionist policy to acquire warmwater ports on the Indian Ocean — which implied further expansion into neighboring Pakistan. Hence, the United States claimed that the rationale behind its support for the Afghan Mujahideen was to stop the claimed Soviet expansion into the Persian Gulf.  Indirect negotiations for six years  Brokered by the United Nations, the Geneva Talks was a series of twelve rounds of indirect negotiations that ran for six years starting from June 1982 to April 1988. The talks nominally took place between the governments of Afghanistan and Pakistan, but the key actors behind the scenes were the Soviet Union and the United States. The outcome of this process was the Geneva Accords which was a set of four interrelated agreements signed on 14 April 1988 by the foreign ministers of Afghanistan and Pakistan and by the US Secretary of State and the Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union as the international guarantors.  At the heart of the Geneva talks was an effort by the United Nations to help the parties find a negotiated solution for the withdrawal of the Soviet troops from Afghanistan. The Soviet Union and the Afghan Communist regime reasoned that the Soviet troops would leave Afghanistan once the threat from the Mujahideen was removed. To remove the threat from the Mujahideen, they demanded the United States and Pakistan to halt their support for the Mujahideen first and then the Soviet forces would withdraw. However, the United States and Pakistan contended that the Mujahideen was not the cause but the consequence of the Soviet involvement in Afghanistan and therefore the Soviet troops must withdraw without any preconditions.  Seeking regime change  The removal of the Communist regime … was one of the main objectives behind the US involvement in the Afghan conflict.  In addition to the issue of the Soviet troops, there was another issue at stake which was not overtly part of the negotiations in Geneva but important to both the Soviet Union and the United States. Besides a withdrawal of the Soviet troops, the United States and Pakistan sought a regime change in Kabul. The removal of the Communist regime in Kabul was one of the main objectives behind the US involvement in the Afghan conflict. For that reason the US government, under Jimmy Carter, had supplied covert financial assistance to the Mujahideen about six months prior to the Soviet invasion. However, for the Soviet Union the survival of the regime in Kabul was of paramount importance because according to the Soviet leader, Leonid Brezhnev, the primary reason for the presence of Soviet troops in Afghanistan was to prevent the fall of the regime.  Withdrawal and noninterference  Hence, the two main issues in the Geneva Talks were withdrawal of the Soviet troops and noninterference. Noninterference referred to a cessation of the US and Pakistan’s support for the Afghan Mujahideen. By implication it also meant that the United States and Pakistan would not pursue a regime change in Kabul.  Differences over who would rule Afghanistan after a withdrawal of the Soviet forces withheld progress in the Geneva Talks for several years. In June 1985, following the ascension of Mikhail Gorbachev as the leader of the Soviet Union, the US and Soviet governments launched bilateral negotiations over regional issues, including Afghanistan.  [Gorbachev] was determined to withdraw from Afghanistan — calling it a bleeding wound for the Soviet Union.  The new Soviet leader was determined to withdraw from Afghanistan — calling it a bleeding wound for the Soviet Union. However, the commencement of bilateral US-Soviet negotiations on Afghanistan meant that the Geneva Talks between Afghanistan and Pakistan was merely a proforma exercise. This meant that substantive negotiations took place between the governments of the United States and the Soviet Union, and their outcomes manifested in the Geneva format which was nominally taking place between the governments of Afghanistan and Pakistan.  In November 1985, Premier Gorbachev and President Reagan met in Geneva. Afghanistan was part of the agenda, and once again, a main point of contention between the two leaders was about the status of the Afghan government. Gorbachev proposed declaring Afghanistan a nonaligned state followed by a withdrawal of the Soviet troops. Reagan, however, demurred. He pointed out that the president of Afghanistan — Babrak Karmal — was a Soviet client and therefore implied that it was not feasible to establish Afghanistan’s nonalignment without a replacement of the Soviet-backed regime in Kabul.  The Soviet Union, however, aimed to preserve the regime in Kabul. In early 1987, the Afghan Communist regime launched a National Reconciliation Program. The program — funded by the Soviet Union — was designed, in addition to offering a share of power to Mujahideen leaders, to lure individual Mujahideen commanders to reconcile with the regime by offering them financial and economic incentives. In other words, the objective of the National Reconciliation Program was to integrate the Mujahideen within the existing political structure in Kabul. Nonetheless, the Mujahideen rejected the program, as they vowed to continue the fight until the destruction of the Communist regime. In Washington, President Reagan also dismissed the Soviet-funded reconciliation program as a “sham.”  Failed reconciliation and intensifying conflict  The failure of the National Reconciliation Program and an intensifying conflict in Afghanistan prompted the Soviet Union to shift its policy from seeking to preserve the Communist regime to preventing a government led by the Mujahideen. In early December 1987, Soviet officials informed their American counterparts that the Soviet Union had made a decision to withdraw from Afghanistan. They urged the Americans to consider mutual interests. A Mujahideen-led government, the Soviet officials said, would also complicate American interests in the region.  Around the same time, Gorbachev and Reagan held another meeting in Washington. On 9 and 10 December 1987, the two leaders discussed the issue of Afghanistan. Reflecting the change in the Soviet position, Gorbachev said that Afghanistan was not a socialist country but a “semi-feudal pluralistic” country. The Soviet Union, he added, was no more concerned about how the people of Afghanistan chose to live. He invited Reagan to “think together in a businesslike approach” to establish a neutral government in the context of a Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan.  The US position, however, was that a neutral government could not be established without the removal of the Soviet-backed regime in Kabul. Hence, Reagan proposed disbanding the military structures of the Afghan Communist regime in the context of a Soviet withdrawal. In other words, Reagan wanted to dismantle the ruling regime and then “start from scratch.”  Breaking the deadlock  Two months after the Washington Summit, Gorbachev announced on 9 February 1988 that the Soviet Union was ready to start the withdrawal of its troops from Afghanistan on 15 May 1988 and to complete it within ten months. He added that the withdrawal from Afghanistan was no more conditional on an agreement about the future government of Afghanistan. That, he said, is “none of our business.”  The unilateral announcement by Gorbachev broke the insistent deadlock in the Geneva Talks which had been taking place between the governments of Afghanistan and Pakistan but without substantial progress. However, two months after Gorbachev’s announcement, the Geneva Talks concluded in April 1988 with the signing of the Geneva Accords which, among other elements, set a nine-month timeframe for the withdrawal of the Soviet troops from Afghanistan.  Letting the conflict take its course  Following the withdrawal of the Soviet troops in February 1989, the two superpowers allowed the conflict between the Mujahideen and the Afghan Communist regime to take its course. The expression of this policy was best exemplified in a conversation between Gorbachev and the US Secretary of State, James Baker, in February 1990. Referring to the ongoing war in Afghanistan, Gorbachev said: “Let them boil in their own juices over there.” To which, Baker responded: “When you said, ‘Let them boil,’ I thought we have the same feeling.”  ***  Rahmat Hashemi is a Doctoral Researcher at PRIO."

Munir had to endure the former PM’s reciprocal indignity of supposed corruption charges  When the relatively unknown and perceptibly dour Gen. Syed Asim Munir took over as Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff from the barrel-chested and garrulous Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa on November 29, 2022, it seemed like a change of sensibilities and perhaps even narrative. Gen. Bajwa’s initial “selection” (2018 elections) and later “ejection” (2022 no-trust vote) of Imran Khan was completed. Gen. Bajwa hung up his boots while the vainglorious Imran was given the boot! But it wasn’t the end as Imran kept ranting, provoking and getting under the Pakistan Army’s skin. Beyond Gen. Bajwa and the current ISI chief (Lt. Gen. Nadeem Anjum), Imran called out the ISI number two (Maj. Gen. Faisal Naseer, “Dirty Harry”) to shame the “establishment”. It was a pressure test for Gen. Munir. Imran baited, Gen. Munir bit hard. Ultimately, no change of narrative resulted.  In hindsight, Gen. Munir was always the establishment’s “chosen one” — meaning of Gen. Bajwa. The reasons are clearer now. Gen. Munir had tellingly overcome the technicality of getting “selected” for COAS despite his then retirement date as a lieutenant-general falling on November 27, while Gen. Bajwa was to doff his uniform only by November 29, yet Gen. Munir defied the odds of required adjustment. The farce of Schedule V-A of Pakistan’s Rule of Business says: “The appointment of, and above the rank of, lieutenant-general in the Army and equivalent ranks in the other defence services will be made by the Prime Minister in consultation with the President”. The real McCoy for passing the COAS’ Malacca cane was singularly Gen. Bajwa, representing the establishment. Incidentally, the sitting Pakistan President, Arif-ur-Rehman Alvi, is a founder member of Imran’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaaf (PTI): he couldn’t possibly have been allowed to exercise his mandated choice, not in the circumstances then prevailing.  As a rare Shia COAS, Gen. Munir faces the onerous task of exhibiting his fidelity to the “establishment” and steely resolve to the nation, just as it drove the only two other Shia COAS — Gen. Muhammad Musa and Gen. Yahya Khan — to wars with India in 1965 and 1971. Gen. Munir carries the unsaid burden of proving himself in a deeply sectarian society. He was ISI D-G when the Pulwama attack took place on February 14, 2019. Not responding or succumbing to Imran’s accusations about Pakistan’s Army was not an option.  Lo and behold, on May 9, 2023, Imran was bumped into a personnel carrier of the Punjab Rangers and whisked away rather unceremoniously for a former Prime Minister. It was reminiscent of the arrests of Iskander Mirza in 1958 (Ayub Khan’s coup), Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto in 1978 (Zia-ul Haq’s coup) and Nawaz Sharif in 1999 (Pervez Musharraf’s coup). Gen. Munir moved against a man who seemed to be unsettling the Deep State even more than the ruling civilian government.  Gen. Munir earned his place at the top with the critical “one crescent, one star and three crowns” on his epaulettes (as a brigadier), directly under then X Corps commander Gen. Bajwa. Clearly not wet behind his ears in terms of societal posturing, Gen. Munir is a Hafiz-e-Quran (one who has memorised the complete Quran). Unlike many flamboyant colleagues, he served “under the radar” and seemed “safe” (as was ironically, and wrongly, assumed for Ayub Khan, Zia-ul Haq and Pervez Musahrraf). Well-versed with the intrigues of Pakistan, Gen. Munir is the only COAS to have worn the dual hats of director-general of military intelligence and also director-general of ISI.  With the shortest tenure as the ISI D-G, due to his unusual questioning of the corruption trail leading to the wife of then PM Imran Khan, Gen. Munir has his unhealed personal history with him. As Imran’s bête noire, Gen. Munir had to endure the former PM’s reciprocal indignity of supposed corruption charges, while posted as XXX Corps commander. However, as ISI D-G, he would have been wise enough to know the consequences of pointing fingers at the PM’s wife, so presumably he would have only been doing Gen. Bajwa’s bidding to send out a message to Imran to adhere to the establishment’s playbook. But Imran didn’t confine himself to the establishment’s red lines. While Gen. Munir was to be the sacrificial lamb in 2019, he romped home in 2022 as the dark horse who became the all-powerful COAS.  If ever there was any doubt about Gen. Munir as Gen. Bajwa’s acolyte, it was put to rest with his “taking stock” of the situation, as Pakistan’s generals tend to do historically, whenever they or their institution stand to get besmirched. Whether Imran Khan has tripped Gen. Munir into making him an ever-bigger hero in the public eye, or, has bitten more than he can chew, will depend on how the emotions get manufactured and controlled in the days and weeks to come. But the “establishment” has moved decisively, and committed itself to a point of no return — at least for the next two and a half years of Gen. Munir’s tenure. Imran stands to be politically neutralised (not physically, as he melodramatically claimed, as that would irreversibly turn the public tide against the Army).  So, brace yourself for sneaky leaks, sleazy exposés and corruption charges against “Taliban Khan” (as the world increasingly sees him), that will be gleefully and dutifully supported by the discredited ruling side and scared judiciary. Whenever the “establishment” decides to do something, they usually get it, legitimately or illegitimately. Gen. Munir has turned out to be a chip of the old block!"

But the Republican interpretation of the final Durham report will feed a narrative of “Deep State” corruption that is fueling not only Mr. Trump’s quest for the White House in 2024 but that of many of his rivals for the Republican nomination. The vilification of federal bureaucracy was already an emerging theme in the fight to be the Republican standard-bearer. Regardless of Mr. Durham’s actual conclusions, his report appears to serve that theme.  Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, Mr. Trump’s closest competitor in the still-early Republican primary race, promised on Monday “to clean house” at “weaponized federal agencies,” which he said had “manufactured a false conspiracy theory.”  “Heads need to roll,” another competitor, former Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina, said.  Mr. Trump had termed the Russia investigation “the crime of the century,” and with no one doing time for that crime, the Durham report could still prove to be Exhibit A in how the American right seems to be living in its own universe — and how Mr. Trump still dictates the parameters of that separate reality.  On his Truth Social website, Mr. Trump said the special prosecutor had concluded that “the FBI should never have launched the Trump-Russia Probe!” In fact, Mr. Durham said he agreed that the F.B.I. should have opened a preliminary investigation.  “I, and much more importantly, the American public have been victims of this long-running and treasonous charade started by the Democrats — started by Comey,” Mr. Trump told Fox News Digital. “There must be a heavy price to pay for putting our country through this.”"

But if the Welsh club want to stay in the EFL, or challenge for promotion from League Two, they will need to bring in some fresh faces this summer. Manager Phil Parkinson already boasts an impressive squad but knows there is always room for improvement.  Wrexham's Hollywood owners Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney want to sign Gareth Bale, but that is highly unlikely to happen. Yet there's a chance they will lure some more former internationals to the Racecourse after persuading Ben Foster out of retirement.  Image: Getty Images) Getty Images)  Foster's short-term deal with Wrexham will expire shortly, but the club are in talks with the former England goalkeeper, 40, over an extension. It will be difficult for Foster to say no after the joyous celebrations that followed Wrexham's title triumph.  One area of the team that Parkinson doesn't need to worry about too much is the defence. Wrexham boasted the third-best defence in the National League this season thanks to a solid back three, with Jordan Tunnicliffe, Ben Tozer, Eoghan O'Connell, Aaron Hayden and Thomas O'Connor all impressing at different times in the year.  O'Connell, 27, is likely to continue playing in defence having only signed from Charlton in January. Tunnicliffe, 29, Tozer, 33, Hayden, 26, and O'Connor, 24, also have EFL experience and will continue playing while Parkinson looks for long-term replacements.  Who do you think Wrexham should sign this summer? Let us know in the comments below!  At right-wing-back, Ryan Barnett, 23, was snapped up from Solihull Moors in February and will be confident of playing in League Two next season. On the opposite flank, Danny Rose could make a shock move to Wrexham to reignite his football career.  The Champions League finalist, 32, has expressed a desire to make a comeback but will want the right club after a year out of the game. Considering the bond between Reynolds, McElhenney and the club's employees, Wrexham could be the perfect fit.  The same could be said about Danny Drinkwater, who would be a huge coup for the Welsh club. The Premier League winner, 33, has also been without a club since last summer but recently admitted he was ""waiting for an offer to excite me"". You heard him, Wrexham.  Drinkwater could form a partnership with James Jones in midfield. The Scot, 27, has played 88 games for Wrexham during the last two years and has plenty of experience in the EFL, making more than 200 appearances in League One and League Two combined.  In terms of the No.10 role, Jonny Williams would be an ideal candidate. The Welshman, 29, helped his country reach the semi-finals of Euro 2016 and has played at every level in the Football League. His contract with Swindon will expire next month.  But who plays alongside Paul Mullin? The 28-year-old could be joined by his former strike partner Joe Ironside, 29, who has just been released. The pair scored 48 goals between them to fire Cambridge to promotion from League Two during the 2020/21 campaign."

Early this year, the regime halted insurance payouts for families of 66th Light Infantry Division (LID) soldiers killed in Kayah (Karenni) State whose bodies could not be recovered. They are listed as missing in action rather than dead, a source close to families of the 66th LID told The Irrawaddy.  “They are not listed as dead because [the Myanmar military] does not want to give insurance payouts,” he said.  The 66th LID is based in Inma town on the Yangon-Pyay Road some 20 miles to the south of Pyay in Bago Region, and overseen by the Southern Command.  Soldiers who have recently deserted say the bereaved families are not receiving the money owed to them for two reasons. Firstly, corrupt officers are pocketing the payments, and secondly the regime wants to impose news blackouts on the heavy military casualties it is suffering.  The payments were made for regime soldiers who died in clashes with the Arakan Army (AA) in Rakhine State between late 2018 and November 2020 even when their bodies could not be retrieved, said Hein Zaw Oo, a 19-year-old private who defected from the army in April.  “But lately, [the military] has not been sending death benefits and bank savings for soldiers whose bodies cannot be retrieved,” he said.  Hein Zaw Oo last served in Light Infantry Battalion 2 based in Kyaikto, Mon State. The battalion is under the command of 44th LID and is fighting the Karen National Union and People’s Defense Force in Karen State.  It is mandatory for junta soldiers to buy life insurance. Privates are required to buy a minimum two-year policy worth 500,000 kyats (US$ 238 at the official exchange rate) and pay a monthly premium of around 8,400 kyats.  Also compulsory for military personnel is saving money at the military-owned Myawaddy Bank, and buying shares in the military-owned Myanmar Economic Holdings Ltd.  Defector Ye Htet Kyaw, who served as a private in Light Infantry Battalion 341 based in Karen State’s Papun, said battalion commanders would siphon off the money when the dead soldiers had no relatives, or their relatives could not be contacted.  “My superior died after stepping on a land mine while carrying food supplies. He had around two million kyats in his bank account. The battalion commander took the money after his death and said it was deposited in battalion funds. I don’t buy it.”  An estimated 14,890 junta soldiers were killed, and nearly 5,000 wounded in the 12 months after armed revolution began on June 1, 2021, following the military coup in February that year.  CDM captain Htet Myat said: “Most military family members do not know how much military personnel have paid for insurance premiums. Only the soldiers themselves know. And insurance certificates are usually kept at battalion offices. And some family members don’t know about the insurance, in which case they do not get death benefits.”  As family members do not know the insurance amount paid, battalion commanders never give death benefits in full, said defector Ye Htet Kyaw.  “If there is three million kyats in the bank, family members only receive 1.5 million kyats” he said.  Former captain Htet Myat said officers have been siphoning off life insurance payouts since before the coup, listing soldiers killed at front line as missing in action. But the exploitation has worsened since the coup, he added.  Previously, Myanmar military personnel had been required to buy life insurance at state-owned company Myanma Insurance. But since 2015, four years after Min Aung Hlaing became the military chief, military personnel have been required to take out insurance with Aung Myint Moh Min Insurance Co, which is owned by Min Aung Hlaing’s son, Aung Pyae Sone."

When Mohi el-deen Jibril checked his phone on May 11, he saw his name on a list of people accused of betraying the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and supporting the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). Instantly, he thought of leaving his war-torn country.  “Seven journalists appeared on the list, but I was the only one still in Sudan,” Jibril, 48, told Al Jazeera. “I have since received threats from many people. Two [wrote to me on WhatsApp] and said that after the army kills the RSF, they will come for me next.”      Since fighting erupted in Sudan between the army and the RSF last month, supporters from both sides have threatened journalists for criticising human rights violations by both sides, according to the Sudanese Journalists Syndicate.  The number of journalists who have been targeted or intimidated remains unknown, but Al Jazeera identified six people who were told that they would be hurt or killed if they continued reporting abuses.  Many others have appeared on lists circulating on social media, where those mentioned are accused of betraying Sudan in an apparent effort to incite violence against them. The list that Jibril was on was shared in a private WhatsApp group for Sudanese journalists, but he later discovered it on Facebook, too.  As a veteran television reporter, Jibril has been critical of the army for derailing popular aspirations for democracy by spearheading a coup in October 2021. Now, he fears he could be killed.  “I haven’t taken any position in the war, neither in favour of the RSF or army,” said Jibril. “But the people threatening me keep saying that I should support the army.”      Muzzling dissent  Several journalists also told Al Jazeera that members of the National Congress Party (NCP), which is tied to the political Islamic movement in Sudan and former authoritarian leader Omar al-Bashir, are implicated in intimidating journalists.  Members of the NCP have reportedly smeared civilian politicians and incited violence against medics. Many NCP loyalists also hold senior positions in the army and blame RSF leader Mohamed Hamdan “Hemedti” Dagalo for turning against al-Bashir in the face of a popular uprising in April 2019.  Now, they are claiming that anyone who appears neutral is against the army and with the RSF.  “I don’t know some of the people that threatened me, but others I recognise as [remnants] from al-Bashir’s regime,” said Jibril.      Another journalist, who asked Al Jazeera not to disclose her name for fear of reprisal, said she criticised the RSF in a private WhatsApp group for Sudanese media workers after reports that the paramilitary was raiding and looting homes and raping women.  One member in the group who supports the RSF then sent her an ominous message: “He said, ‘Go ahead and keep talking. I’ll be waiting for you. I’ll be waiting,’” she told Al Jazeera.  “The [threats] are coming from both sides. Supporters of the army are making [threatening] calls and [sending threatening] messages to journalists that they perceive to be pro-RSF and the RSF is making calls to people that they think are pro-army,” said Abdelmoneim Abu Idriss, the elected head of the journalists’ syndicate.  Kholood Khair, a Sudan expert and the founding director of the Confluence Advisory think tank, added that both generals are very clearly aligned in suppressing free speech.  “They are not just against each other … but they are very aligned and have always been aligned … in destroying the parts of the state that they don’t like and parts of Sudanese political life that they don’t like,” she told Al Jazeera.      Raids and attacks  On Thursday, the RSF reportedly stormed the media office of the independent newspaper el-Hirak el-Siyasi to intimidate staff and steal their belongings, according to the syndicate.  In the same week, it reported that an RSF fighter shot photojournalist Faiz Abubakr in the back while he was filming clashes on the street. The RSF then detained, interrogated and beat Abubakr, accusing him of spying for military intelligence.  “Journalists are in real danger,” said Mohamad el-Fatih Yousif, a member of the Sudanese Journalists Network, a press freedom group. “Nobody is allowed to take a neutral position.”  Al Jazeera contacted RSF spokesman and political adviser Youssef Ezzat to ask him about the group’s reported threats and attacks against journalists.  “I didn’t hear about any incidents against journalists and actually the RSF cooperates with journalists and reporters for TV channels,” he said.  None of the journalists who spoke to Al Jazeera described the RSF as cooperative, with some adding that they were thinking of fleeing the country out of fear of being targeted by the group or the army.  ‘Duty to stay in Sudan’  But Abu Idriss said that while he understands why his colleagues would escape Sudan, he believes journalists must stay to offer a factual narrative of the war.  “Both sides in the conflict have their information machines on social media that make fake news, publish hate speech and spread propaganda. For this reason, journalists need to stay, so that we have neutral voices,” he told Al Jazeera.  Abu Idriss added that he won’t leave his colleagues behind as the head of the press syndicate.  “It’s my duty to stay in Sudan,” he said. “I have to try and protect [journalists].”"

But opinion is divided over what this means for Europe’s electrofuels (e-fuels) ecosystem, which is largely driven by start-ups and scale-ups.  E-fuels are direct substitutes for conventional fossil fuels such as petrol, diesel and aviation kerosene. To classify as carbon neutral they must be made from hydrogen generated by electricity from renewable sources and carbon dioxide captured from the atmosphere. Although this carbon dioxide is emitted again when the fuel is burned, there is no net contribution to the atmosphere.  That is the basis for the case e-fuels are environmentally sustainable. However, the current process for producing them, by using renewable electricity to split water and produce hydrogen and then combining it with carbon dioxide under pressure and with the use of a catalyst, is highly energy inefficient.  For Amy Hebert, chief executive of Danish start-up Arcadia eFuels, the last-minute decision taken in March to allow new cars running on e-fuels onto the market represents an opportunity. “It’s a huge step,” she said. While electric vehicles will go a long way to decarbonising road transport, she thinks a substantial market will remain for e-fuels.  “If cars can be electrified, that makes absolute sense. In cases where that can’t happen, and people need to drive long distances, then we believe e-fuels are an appropriate alternative,” she said.  Others are not so sure. Swiss solar fuel producer Synhelion expects the opportunity to be small. “As sustainable fuels are generally used where electrification is difficult to implement, we do not believe that the decision will have a major impact,” said Carmen Murer, the company’s head of corporate communications.  Norsk e-Fuel, headquartered in Oslo, also sees little in the decision to make it change its plans. “We are specifically focusing on the sectors where we know there is currently no alternative if you want to have a substantial impact on reducing emissions quickly,” said Luisa Wagner, the company’s communications manager.  Aviation is seen as the sector where e-fuels will find a home. Electrification is challenging, even for short flights, and the use of e-fuels is backed by legislative quotas. Until March there was no such legislative opening for road e-fuels. And even if the decision is implemented, the automotive industry still needs to get behind it.  “E-fuel projects such as ours are dependent on the industry supporting our plans, and so far we have seen a much stronger interest and drive from the aviation sector,” said Wagner.  The eFuel Alliance, which lobbies for the industry in Brussels, is also clear that the opportunity is not yet in the bag. “It’s just a declaration right now. We need concrete proposals from the Commission, and then to see how these will be worked out,” said Ralf Diemer, the Alliance’s managing director.  e-fuel only vehicles  A road map for implementing the decision is expected by the autumn of 2024. The first step is likely to be a regulation for the type approval of vehicles exclusively powered by e-fuels. Work will also be required to define how these vehicles contribute to carbon dioxide emission reduction targets.  The use of e-fuels in existing vehicles will also receive support in legislation. A revision to the Renewable Energy Directive, also agreed in March, sets a mandatory quota that covers advanced biofuels and e-fuels in the transport sector. The revision also contains an option for a binding sub-quota for renewable fuels of non-biological origin, which covers the direct use of renewable hydrogen as well fuels derived from it. Still subject to confirmation by the Parliament and Council of Ministers, both measures would support the development of a market for e-fuels.  For the industry, there is considerable work to be done to meet the existing mandates for e-fuels in aviation and shipping, let alone any eventual road transport market. Start-ups are important players in doing that.  “The big oil companies are the natural choice for producing these products,” Hebert said, “but the regulatory landscape is still a little bit uncertain for them, and the size of production is smaller than what they are used to, at least at the beginning.” This is because of limitations in renewable energy supply and electrolyser maturity. “So it is up to start-up companies to get this market going.”  Diemer also sees start-ups and scale-ups playing an important role. “Especially when it comes to the technologies around electrolysers, around CO2 technologies, around improving efficiency, a lot of new players are on the field, and they are often start-ups,” he said. “This abundance of start-ups underlines that we are operating in an innovative and emerging market.”  However, for industrial scale production they will have to work with the oil industry. “I don’t think this value chain will be possible without big oil,” Diemer said. “You need a lot of capital, you need the industry’s knowledge and distribution channels to put a product in place. And you might also need to use its refineries.”  He thinks it will be interesting to see how start-ups position themselves as the market evolves, with some electrolyser specialists already broadening their scope to support the whole e-fuel production chain, or moving into production.  This is the case for Ineratec, which in April started work on an e-fuel production plant in Frankfurt. “So far, Ineratec has been a technology producer, but now it has decided to run a first production site by itself, together with partners, and in the end it might end up as a fuel producer,” he said  The chemistry of e-fuel production is well established. One route is the Fischer–Tropsch process, developed in the 1920s to convert coal into liquid fuels. The other is to use hydrogen and carbon dioxide to create methanol, which can then be shipped or stored for use as a fuel feedstock. In both cases the technology is mature, so it would be relatively simple for companies producing e-fuels for one sector to pivot to another if demand changed.  Arcadia eFuels, for example, was set up in 2021 to leverage various technologies for the production of e-fuels in transport applications. The company plans to build its first plant at the Port of Vordingborg in the southern part of Zeeland, with production currently scheduled to begin in 2026.  “With the plants we are building we are able produce e-kerosene for jet fuel, we can produce e-diesel for long-haul trucks, for cars or for the shipping industry, and we also produce naphtha, which is a product that can be used for gasoline blending,” Hebert said.  Intermediate product  Norsk e-Fuel is a consortium formed in 2019 including electrolyser technology company Sunfire and carbon capture specialist Climeworks. The company's first production facility, at Mosjøen in northern Norway, is also due to come on line on 2026, and it recently signed a partnership agreement to supply fuel to Norwegian, Norway’s largest airline.  It uses the Fischer-Tropsch route to produce a synthetic crude oil. “From that intermediate product we can do anything that you do with oil, so from a technical point of view we could easily adapt our process to produce diesel or gasoline,” Wagner said.  Regardless of where the fuel is used, the e-fuel industry faces a number of hurdles when it comes to scaling up production. These include development of carbon capture infrastructure, the availability of renewable energy, and production of the technical components.  And there is scope for further innovation. “Electrolyser efficiency is currently around 70%, but there is no reason that cannot increase to more than 95% over the next five to ten years,” said Hebert.  More work also needs to be done on carbon capture. “The ideal technology is direct air capture, but this is currently too expensive and inefficient for industrial production. So, this will require a lot of research and development,” Diemer said.  Even where technology is proven in other spheres, work is required to apply it to e-fuels. “We are filing several patents on the integration of these technologies, which have never been put together in this way before,” Hebert said. “So there is quite a lot of innovation there, and ways to reduce cost.”  Although the chemical processes involved are mature, there is scope for innovation to provide further efficiencies. Already in its first plant, Norsk e-Fuel is planning to integrate a co-electrolyser based on solid oxide cell technology. This makes it possible to combine two process steps in the conventional approach, and to re-use heat generated in the Fischer-Tropsch process.  “Since electricity is the main cost driver in the production of e-fuels, that means more productivity for any given amount of electricity and less cost for the final product,” Wagner said.  Finally, there needs to be political support for the development of the industry and surrounding value chains. “The challenge lies in the industrial scale-up, which we don’t have right now, since we produce only small amounts of e-fuels,” Diemer said. “Unfortunately, the political framework conditions at EU level are thwarting precisely this ramp-up.”  Investment is particularly challenging for the companies. “The e-fuel projects that are ramping up production now are all first movers,” Wagner said. “It’s a new value chain, a new market, and a new product, and those innovations accumulate. So we need investors who are not too risk averse and ready to take on new opportunities.”  Help is also required if e-fuels are to compete on price with fossil fuels. Hebert draws a parallel with wind and solar energy, whose price has fallen dramatically over the past two decades so that it is now competitive with fossil fuels. “I think the same will be true of e-fuels, but we need more incentives and government support to make that happen,” she said.  The challenge for producers in Europe is that the incentives and penalties are aimed at users, such as airlines, or the fuel distributors, not at the companies making the fuels. “In the US, with the Inflation Reduction Act, the incentives go directly to the producer,” Hebert said. “That means the producer can lower the overall price to the end user, so then you’re sure that more plants will get built.”  One aspect of this political support is stability. In this respect, the March decision on new cars was not necessarily a positive development. Made at the last-minute following strong pressure from the German government, some see it as setting a dangerous precedent.  “Where negotiations have been going for years on decisions that industry needs in order to ramp up production, we think it is dangerous if states can intervene at the last moment,” Wagner said. “So, even if it gives us a market in the future, we concerned about the way it came about.”"

Yet within a few hours, the news was already reverberating on both sides of the Atlantic, with global soccer's governing body soon confirming the Brooklyn-born, London-raised Balogun's one-time switch of allegiance. The intense interest in Balogun's decision is understandable in both countries.  Balogun becomes the latest in a parade of highly regarded young dual citizens to choose the U.S. over more decorated programs in recent years. In 2020, midfielder Yunus Musah also opted for the Stars and Stripes over England; last November, Musah played all 90 minutes in a scoreless draw with the Three Lions at the World Cup.  ""To represent the United States means a lot,"" Balogun said in a press release. ""I'm very proud and honored to have this opportunity, and I want to give everything I have to make our team successful.""  U.S. fans are even more excited about Balogun, who just happens to fill the Americans' most glaring positional need. The 21-year-old has 19 goals in 34 games on loan from the Gunners to French team Reims this season.  Balogun instantly becomes the leading candidate to start at center forward for the Americans in next month's CONCACAF Nations League semifinal against chief rival Mexico.  ""Having the opportunity to play against Mexico in a rivalry match would be amazing,"" he said. ""Hopefully, I can make a difference.""  ADVERTISEMENT  Another recruiting coup for the U.S., maybe the most important yet  Like many countries, the U.S. has been fielding dual nationals for decades. And like most others, they've also lost some along the way — most notably New Jersey product Giuseppe Rossi, who opted to play for Italy in the mid-2000s.  But the Americans have been on a roll since 2019, when then-USMNT coach Gregg Berhalter and then-U.S. Soccer sporting director Earnie Stewart flew to the Netherlands to secure the commitment of fullback Sergiño Dest, who was being aggressively recruited by the Dutch. Musah joined up a year later. So did others during Berhalter's four years at the helm, including forwards Jesús Ferreira (Colombia), Ricardo Pepi (Mexico) and Daryl Dike (Nigeria).  Berhalter and his staff didn't land everyone they wanted. But by and large, U.S. Soccer has been wildly successful in this space in recent years — success that has built on itself.  Musah spent time with Balogun in Arsenal's academy and shared his positive experiences with the U.S. program with his former (and now future) teammate, a source confirmed to FOX Sports. The Americans' showing at the World Cup in Qatar didn't hurt, either, nor did the fact the U.S. will host the Copa America next summer and the World Cup in 2026.  ""It's almost too good to be true,"" Balogun said. ""To have the World Cup in America is just crazy, and then to be the host nation and my first World Cup, it's all come together nicely. Some things are just meant to be.""  However it happened, it's another clear coup for the U.S. And given Balogun's age, pedigree and obvious scoring touch, he has a chance to end up being the most impactful of them all.  No coach? No problem for Balogun  The timing of Balogun's decision says a lot about how far the USMNT has come since failing to qualify for the 2018 World Cup. The program's first contact with the player came last year, through Berhalter. Berhalter's contract expired last year, and while recently hired U.S. Soccer sporting director Matt Crocker insists he's a candidate to return, the uncertainty didn't dissuade Balogun any.  Not only did the USMNT not have a coach when U.S. Soccer rolled out the red carpet for Balogun in Orlando in late March, Crocker wasn't yet on board. Neither was Oguchi Onyewu, who effectively became Crocker's deputy last week. Former USMNT general manager Brian McBride had departed months earlier.  None of that organizational uncertainty moved Balogun to wait to make his choice. The fact he picked the U.S. without even knowing which coach will be making the lineup decisions between now and 2026 speaks to how comfortable he was, how sure he is that playing for his birth nation — which he left at age 2 — is the best option.  ""In the end, it became a no-brainer,"" Balogun said of his decision. ""It feels like I'm at home here.""  That's a testament to the culture that has been built in the American dressing room.  Newcomer could lead American line for years  While Musah and other recent commits lauded how they were immediately accepted by their U.S. teammates, and while the Americans no doubt did all they could to make Balogun feel welcome when he visited their camp, the on-field fit was surely also a factor.  Harry Kane is England's captain and starting striker when healthy, and he's still just 29. Behind him are at least two other established Premier League scorers: Marcus Rashford and Callum Wilson.  The U.S., meanwhile, has been without a clear-cut center forward since Jozy Altidore's days with the national team ended in 2019. Three different men — Ferreira, Haji Wright and Josh Sargent — started games for the Americans at the World Cup. Only Wright scored in Qatar. Balogun has more goals this season than any of them, plus Dike and Pepi, despite playing in a stronger league.  The opportunity for Balogun is clear. He withdrew from England's U-21 camp in March and flew to Florida only after England senior team boss Gareth Southgate didn't name a replacement for the injured Rashford. Now, he's likely to make his full international debut inside a packed NFL stadium in Las Vegas in less than a month, with plenty more high-profile games to follow.  ""It's a really young, energetic squad and for sure the potential of the squad is amazing,"" Balogun said. ""I think I can add my qualities.""  In the end, the chance to quickly establish himself as the guy for the Americans for the better part of the next decade simply was too attractive for Balogun to pass up.

To contribute, click here.  •••  The 10th Ward violence has been a long time coming, and no one cares till it's filmed (""DFL melee is a sign of the times,"" editorial, May 16). The truth is the politics of division and derision were on display during the failed Jan. 6 coup, and at the Minneapolis 10th Ward convention. This is not a Republican or Democratic issue, this is an American political system issue.  What needs to be addressed is not only the behavior of those on the floor; there must be accountability for those running for office and seeking the party endorsement. I lived in the 10th Ward for over a decade, till two years ago. I watched the escalation, especially in the last four years, toward this politics of division, derision and hate: ""Those not supporting me are the enemy.""  The races are not about ideas, a vision of leadership and unity after a hard-fought race. It's us vs. them. You only talk to your base and rile them up by saying in subtle ways that your opponent and their supporters are the enemy.  Until the party stands up and holds the candidates responsible for sparking this and the supporters who follow through with the inevitable violence responsible, nothing will change. The party needs to draw the line. If violence is not the answer, then hold everyone accountable. But we all know nothing will be done and the politics of hate will just grow stronger, and everyone will lose.  David Schlosser, Minneapolis  GUN LEGISLATION  Popular in the abstract  In response to a May 15 letter about gun legislation: Thank for your spirited take on Minnesota's public safety bill. I must, however, correct a few misinterpretations.  Public policy polling doesn't equate to support for specific legislation. The devil, as they say, is in the details. When the minutiae of a policy are revealed, public approval fluctuates dramatically as people learn the actual scope of legislation.  When we question the potential political fallout for Sens. Grant Hauschild, Rob Kupec and Judy Seeberger, we're not issuing threats but merely observing the political pulse of their districts. It's not a threat to predict a storm when the clouds are already gathering.  The ""cloak and dagger"" approach to passing this bill, sneaking language into a 500-plus-page omnibus bill after it never saw the Senate floor, thus avoiding a clear up or down vote, doesn't scream ""confidence in constituent support"" to me. It's more like a shell game meant to obfuscate their intent from their voters. That's not bravery, it's political subterfuge.  And let's touch on the ""independent spirit"" of these senators. On the campaign trail, and even during session, they've pledged to be mavericks, but one glance at their voting record shows they fall in line with their party like ducks in a row. Independence isn't just a word; it's an action. And sometimes, it means disagreeing with your party.  We don't make threats; we advocate for the rights of Minnesota's peaceable gun owners. It'd be nice if our senators did the same.  Rob Doar, Blaine  The writer is a lobbyist for the Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus.  ELECTIONS  State can empower average voters  According to Open Secrets, 2022 national midterm elections fundraising skyrocketed to $8.9 billion, a new record. The U.S. Supreme Court's Citizens United ruling made it legal for corporations to contribute unlimited amounts to campaigns in the name of free speech. Regardless of political affiliations, wealthy special interests look out for themselves, not everyday Americans. Two items at the Minnesota Legislature are flying below the radar that could strengthen our democracy by reducing candidates' dependence on big money.  The first is in the state government and election omnibus bill. It would triple the Campaign Finance Board's public subsidy program for political candidates who register with the board. The public subsidy program was started in 1974 in response to the Watergate scandal. A candidate must sign and file a public subsidy agreement to qualify for the program. They have to abide by the disclosure and fundraising requirements the board sets.  For years the budget has stagnated at $1.2 million per biennium for candidates running for office. That amount comes from the general fund and is equally divided among all candidates of major political parties running for a specified office. If the conference committee includes this provision, it will increase by $2.1 million for fiscal years 2024 and 2025 for a total of $3.3 million. This means less money to raise and more time communicating with voters about the issues that matter to them.  The next is in the Senate tax omnibus bill. The Senate and House have proposed to increase the political contribution reimbursement program from $50 per individual to $75 and for married couples from $100 to $150. If passed, it would increase the proportional importance of small donors and average Minnesotans so that candidates do not depend as much on large contributions, lobbyists or special interests.  Earlier this session the Democracy Dollars bill was introduced that would issue a $25 dollar voucher to each voter to donate to candidates. It didn't advance. Seattle adopted this program in 2015 with great success. It's seen that it not only reduces the influence of big contributors but it encourages more people to run for office, increases the number of voters and gives everyday people a bigger voice in their elections. We've been advocating for a voucher program since 2017 and hope to see it return in the next biennium.  We must restore balance and create a system where every citizen has an equal vote and say. More public financing of campaigns is good for democracy and is a bipartisan issue. We urge the tax committee and the state government and elections conference committee to include these increases in their final reports, for the House and Senate to pass them so they can be signed by the governor and be available for the 2024 election.  Mary Hartnett, Minneapolis  The writer is executive director, Clean Elections Minnesota.  DURHAM REPORT  Where was the detailed coverage?  Admittedly the report by John Durham into the origins of the Trump-Russia collusion allegation was less than the ""blockbuster "" President Donald Trump promised. Nevertheless, the 306-page report should have been treated with far more importance than the Star Tribune gave it, limiting its coverage to two paragraphs on page A6, which reported only that Durham accused the FBI of a ""lack of analytical rigor"" (""Durham issues final Russia inquiry report,"" May 16). With another presidential election on the horizon, Durham's findings should have been given far more comprehensive coverage.  Durham's conclusion that the FBI ""failed to uphold their important mission of strict fidelity to the law"" when it launched its investigation into the Trump campaign using ""seriously flawed information"" is of major importance if we are to avoid a repeat in 2024. His finding that the FBI rushed to investigate the Trump campaign even as it proceeded cautiously on allegations related to his Democratic opponent suggests it favored one candidate over another. Its disparate treatment went even further, giving defensive briefings to the Clinton campaign that were denied the Trump campaign. The report went so far as to suggest the FBI should have considered whether it was being ""manipulated for political or other purposes.""  Democracy is threatened when its premier intelligence agency demonstrates a clear preference of one candidate over another. That is the importance of the Durham report, and for that reason it merited far more comprehensive coverage than it was given by this paper.  Ronald Haskvitz, Golden Valley"

Since the country’s transition to democracy in 2010, it has faced pressure to implement effective reforms and regulations for companies, particularly in relation to foreign investments. One crucial aspect of these reforms has been the protection of human rights (HR) violated by corporations. However, due to the Military Coup in February 2021, legal reform progress has been halted, and the country is now facing even more serious human rights violations. Therefore, this article aims to shed light on the problems with existing laws and enforcement mechanisms concerning human rights violations from an Environmental Human Rights (EHR) perspective. Additionally, it proposes potential solutions under the current circumstances.  Legal Framework  In Myanmar, the concept of corporate crime is relatively new to regulators and law enforcement agencies. This is evident in the recent laws that regulate the Environmental Human Rights (EHR) Protection Agenda. The notion of corporate social responsibility related to EHR was only introduced in 2012 through the Environmental Conservation Law and the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (EIA) Procedure in 2015. Other regulatory developments include the Myanmar Investment Law and Rules, which establish a licensing procedure for projects with significant environmental and community impacts, the Conservation of Biodiversity and Protected Area Law of 2018, and the Forest Law of 2018. For the purpose of this article, these laws will be collectively referred to as “the Legal Framework.”  Despite the existence of this Legal Framework, exploitation and abuses persist, indicating its ineffectiveness in deterring companies from committing EHR violations. Thus, this article aims to identify the reasons why the Legal Framework falls short in deterring EHR offenses and explore alternative approaches to achieve deterrence.  Issues  According to American legal philosopher Lon L. Fuller, a successful legal system must possess the following characteristics: (1) generality, (2) publicity, (3) prospectivity, (4) clarity, (5) consistency, (6) stability, (7) capacity to be performed, and (8) congruence (Fuller’s eight principles). The failure of the Legal Framework in Myanmar may be attributed to a lack of adherence to some of these principles. A more comprehensive examination is required to determine which of the eight principles are lacking in the Legal Framework. This article primarily highlights issues related to congruence and clarity.  The issues identified in this article are as follows:  1) Inefficiency of Punishments  The Legal Framework criminalizes all environmental offenses, and the available punishments are divided into three categories: civil penalties, administrative penalties, and criminal actions. Administrative penalties empower relevant government agencies to impose fines, business suspension or closure, and blacklisting, among other measures. Alternatively, civil and criminal actions can be pursued, with prosecutors presenting cases before the court for stronger sanctions such as imprisonment or larger fines, in accordance with the Attorney-General of the Union Law of 2010. Notably, prosecutors in Myanmar do not currently possess the discretion to enter into Deferred Prosecution Agreements (DPAs) or Non-Prosecution Agreements (NPAs) that would incentivize organizational reform. Consequently, it can be concluded that the Legal Framework in Myanmar leans towards retribution and deterrence theories rather than the reformative theory.  To effectively deter corporate crimes, the laws should be designed to increase the costs and reduce the profitability associated with such offenses, given the profit-driven nature of companies. However, the available sanctions under the Legal Framework are insufficient to shift this balance.  Under the existing Framework, the highest fine for environmental offenses is set at USD 10,000.  Although this amount may carry significance for individuals, it represents a low risk for companies engaged in investments that can have a substantial impact on the environment. Additionally, administrative officials have the authority to impose other penalties alongside fines. However, the lack of clear guidelines is a legal concern. As Professor Fuller mentioned in his aforementioned book, “Obscure and incoherent legislation can make legality unattainable by anyone, or at least unattainable without an unauthorized revision, which itself impairs legality.” When officers are granted discretionary power without proper guidelines, the consideration for effective deterrence is often overlooked. For instance, under the Forest Law, the arresting Forest Officer possesses the authority to cancel permits as a form of punishment. However, there are no rules or guidelines regarding the determination of such penalties, such as considering the scale of the offense, the nature of the offender, or the impact of the offense. Consequently, it is less likely that corporate offenders are deterred from committing crimes.  It is worth noting that some of these laws allow for criminal sanctions, where the amount of fines is determined based on the judge’s discretion. Although this represents progress towards achieving deterrence, it can also be ineffective for three reasons:  Court procedures are often time-consuming, which may delay addressing urgent environmental issues. There is a lack of guidelines for judges to consider factors such as the size of the company and the scale of the impact. Most judges have limited exposure to large companies and environmental assessments, which can hinder their ability to impose larger fines.  2) Compliance and Enforcement Issues  Congruence between official action and the law is essential for the functioning of a legal system. One factor that can impair congruence is “stupidity.” Strong evidence of this can be observed in the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Procedure and its implementation gap. The World Bank’s 2019 Report identified issues with the implementation of the EIA procedure, highlighting the slow progress in approvals. For example, out of 1,971 Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) submitted, only 112 were approved in 2019. Compared to the data from 2018, the approval rate had only increased by 4. The report also recognized the limited technical capacity and resources of the EIA Division to effectively review EIAs/IEEs/EMPs. These findings demonstrate that the existing EIA procedure cannot function properly given the current capacity of the officers.  Professor Fuller has pointed out additional challenges to congruence, including bribery, prejudice, and the pursuit of personal power, collectively known as “corruption.” In 2022, Myanmar ranked 157 out of 180 countries in Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index, marking a new low in the ranking after the Military took over the country in February 2021. Prior to the coup, corruption in Myanmar was monitored by the Anti-Corruption Commission. However, following the conviction and accusation of corruption against State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the commission lost its credibility. This situation has created opportunities for government officials to engage in corruption. Furthermore, the new political situation has caused a 16% rise in the inflation index, leading to socio-economic difficulties in the country. This puts significant strain on government officials whose salaries are already low. Additionally, due to the revolution, many government officials have joined the Civil Disobedience Movement, resulting in a labor shortage within the government system. As a result, those who choose to remain in the system become susceptible to corruption either due to personal strain or the lack of supervision and opportunity. The prevalence of corruption among officials has created a culture of neutrality, further exacerbating the issue.  This corruption incentivizes the growth of corporate crimes in the country due to the administrative discretionary power held by government officials, as mentioned earlier. This situation is particularly problematic in cases of environmental offenses, as most issues and complaints arise from communities in remote areas where large-scale projects are taking place. Consequently, this corruption has undermined the effectiveness of the Legal Framework intended to deter offenders.  Solution  Under normal circumstances, these issues could be addressed through legislative amendments, training programs, or rigorous monitoring. However, given the ongoing unrest in Myanmar, creative solutions are required.  In Myanmar, the People’s Republic of China (China) is the second-largest investor, reportedly holding 23.48% of foreign investments. Specifically, many small-scale Myanmar operations in the mining sector, particularly in border areas, receive informal backing from Chinese capital. These projects are expanding rapidly after the coup and are unlikely to comply with environmental standards. The corrupted local officials and military regime are unwilling to interfere with these projects due to their shared private interests. This article proposes that this situation could be addressed through the implementation of Human Rights Due Diligence (HRDD) measures mandated by the EU Directive on Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence.  According to the Interpretive Guide to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights provided by OHCHR, HRDD is “an ongoing management process that a reasonable and prudent enterprise needs to undertake, in light of its circumstances (including sector, operating context, size, and similar factors) to meet its responsibility to respect human rights.” While the concept of HRDD is reflected in many international standards, none of these standards, principles, and guidelines are legally binding or require corporations to actively engage. This lack of binding requirements hampers corporate compliance. However, a new EU Directive aims to change this. Under this Directive, EU companies will be obligated to conduct due diligence throughout their entire value chain, including subsidiaries and cross-border independent third parties, to ensure the protection of human rights and the environment, regardless of the presence or absence of laws in third countries. This obligation expands the corporate liability of EU companies and imposes pecuniary fines, compensations, or other legal remedies for HR and EHR violations committed by their affiliated companies.  Being the major actor in global value chain, Chinese companies work closely with the companies in the EU Market. In fact, China holds $770 million FDI in the EU. The Directive, therefore, will surely have impact not only on the local Chinese companies but also those in the third-world countries like Myanmar where the productions of raw materials are taking place. This impact will, hopefully, indirectly help reducing the HR and EHR violations in Myanmar.  Conclusion"

AFP via Getty Images  One month after fighting between Sudan's two military factions broke out in the capital, Khartoum, internationally-brokered peace talks in Saudi Arabia have yielded no solution. Airstrikes and artillery continued to pound the country's capital and surrounding regions in recent days, and violence has also spread to the long-embattled Darfur region in the west. The International Rescue Committee (IRC) said Monday that more than 600 people had been killed and over 5,000 injured as a result of the fighting. The real toll is expected to be far higher. Almost a million people have fled their homes, both to locations within Sudan and across the border to neighboring countries. Meanwhile, those who have stayed put often have no access to essentials despite a commitment from the two warring factions to restore access to food and electricity. Prices of food and fuel have soared, exacerbating malnutrition and hammering the local economy. Warring generals Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, leader of the Sudanese Armed Forces, and Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (or ""Hemedti""), leader of the Rapid Support Forces, show no signs of halting the conflict as they vie for total control of the state's military and government, natural resources and 46 million inhabitants. The U.S., U.N. and Saudi Arabia are brokering talks between the two sides, though tentative cease-fires and commitments to allow humanitarian corridors into the sprawling country have collapsed almost immediately.  'The needs are immense'  The IRC warned Monday that the humanitarian situation will continue to deteriorate unless all parties involved prioritize the protection of civilians. ""We know there are many uncertainties for people right now, but one thing that's clear is the needs are immense, immediate and will be for a long time,"" said IRC Vice President for East Africa Kurt Tjossem. ""The longer they remain in these conditions, the more vulnerable they become to disease, hunger, and other hardships."" Things have come a long way from 2021 when Burhan and Hemedti led a military coup that ousted the civilian government of Abdalla Hamdok. Since then, the SAF and RSF had been sharing power in Khartoum to facilitate what most Sudanese citizens hoped would be a transition back to civilian rule. The World Bank and several global powers froze aid to the country after the military takeover, honoring calls from civilians not to legitimize its leadership. However, Burhan and Hemedti's divergent political visions were never reconciled, and the fragile power-sharing arrangement began to unravel in early April, culminating in the breakout of a full-scale conflict in Khaartoum on April 15.

Yet many Sudanese believe that despite the efforts of various regional and international bodies, the Jeddah talks — lacking a substantial civilian voice and the threat of harsh international sanctions against the generals and their respective inner circles — will not be part of the solution.  Rewarding 'belligerence'  Sudanese-Australian writer, broadcaster and activist Yassmin Abdel-Magied told CNBC last week that global leaders had inadvertently given Burhan and Hemedti political legitimacy and rewarded their ""belligerence,"" leaving the majority of Sudanese who long for civilian government unrepresented. Both the SAF and RSF benefit from financial and political support from foreign powers including Egypt, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Libya, the University of Cambridge's Associate Professor Sharath Srinivasan told CNBC last month. While Benjamin Hunter from risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft, said these close relationships make it more difficult for a resolution to the conflict to be found imminently. Targeted and collaborative efforts by the international community to exert pressure on the countries supporting Sudan's military factions were needed, Abdel-Magied said. ""If [their] resource[s], financial and otherwise, can be throttled, then we might actually be able to find the right kind of incentive that's going to make them stop fighting,"" she told CNBC via telephone.  watch now"

The air strikes, explosions and clashes could be heard in the south of Khartoum, and there was heavy shelling across the River Nile in parts of the adjoining cities of Bahri and Omdurman, witnesses said.  The fighting between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has triggered unrest in other areas of Sudan, especially in the western region of Darfur, but is concentrated in Khartoum.  It has caused a humanitarian crisis that threatens to destabilise the region,displacing more than 700,000 people inside Sudan and forcing about 200,000 to flee into neighbouring countries.  ""The situation is unbearable. We left our house to go to a neighbour's house in Khartoum, escaping from the war, but the bombardment follows us wherever we go,"" said Ayman Hassan, a 32-year-old resident.  ""We don't know what the citizens did to deserve a war in the middle of the houses.""  Fighting has surged both in Khartoum and in Geneina, capital of West Darfur, since the two warring parties began talks in Jeddah brokered by Saudi Arabia and the United States more than a week ago.  The talks have produced a statement of principles around providing access for aid supplies and protecting civilians, but mechanisms for setting up humanitarian corridors and agreeing to a ceasefire are still being discussed.  The army has relied mainly on air strikes and shelling, only occasionally engaging in ground fighting, as it tries to push back RSF forces that took up positions in neighbourhoods across Khartoum soon after the fighting erupted on April 15.  The RSF attacked major military bases in northern Omdurman and southern Khartoum on Tuesday in an apparent attempt to prevent the army from deploying heavy weaponry and fighter jets, residents and witnesses said.  The army has been trying to cut off RSF supply lines from outside the capital and to secure strategic sites including the airport in central Khartoum and the major Al-Jaili oil refinery in Bahri.  The war began after disputes over plans for the RSF to join the army and the future chain of command under an internationally backed deal for a political transition towards civilian rule and elections.  Army chief General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, took the top positions on Sudan's ruling council following the 2019 overthrow of former leader Omar al-Bashir during a popular uprising.  They staged a coup two years later as a deadline to hand power to civilians approached, but both sides began to mobilise their forces as mediators tried to finalise the new transition plan.

Footage of that evening, on 20 November 1970, was broadcast live from the Royal Albert Hall in London to about 100 million viewers worldwide, and shows Hosten, representing Grenada, looking radiantly beautiful and endearingly stunned, as host Bob Hope places the winner’s crown on her head.  Her moment in the spotlight had already been overshadowed, however. Approximately 40 minutes earlier, the proceedings were interrupted when a group of women’s liberation activists began sounding football rattles and throwing flour-bombs in protest at what they saw as an egregious display of sexism.  Hosten, who was backstage at that point, could only hear the demonstrators. “I don’t think I was scared,” she says, “but the sound made us wonder what was going on. People thought the contest had come to an end.” Once order was restored, a visibly shaken Hope returned to the stage and attempted to assign meaning to the melee: “I want to tell you anybody that would try to break up an affair as wonderful as this … with these wonderful girls from the entire world, have got to be on some kind of dope!”  Hosten as Miss World in 1970. Photograph: Bill Zygmant/REX/Shutterstock  In the half-century since, Miss World 1970 has been touted as an example of the need for “intersectional feminism”, before the phrase had even been invented. Was the contest ever really intended as a celebration of international womanhood? Or was it always just an organised excuse for an ogle? Either way, in the eye of the storm, Miss World herself found some clarity: “It seemed like all these things were supposed to happen, that it was meant to be,” says Hosten, who is now 75, from her home just outside Toronto, Canada. “At that point, I realised how much I had to do on my own.”  Even if the event made her a global celebrity, Miss World was by no means the culmination of Hosten’s career: she would go on to travel the world, meet movie stars and heads of state, obtain several advanced degrees and have a ringside seat for history in the making. She has very much written her own script.  Hosten was born in 1947 in St George’s, the picturesque capital of her Caribbean island home, the youngest of five children. It was an idyllic childhood, characterised by morning sea-swims and evenings spent gathered around the radio, which fostered a patriotism that Hosten has carried throughout her life. “When I look back on my childhood I realise I really was quite blessed,” she says. “We didn’t know about drugs and we didn’t have social media to contend with. We made our own fun.”  Jennifer Hosten with her brother Robin, her mother and father, and her sister Pommie. Photograph: Sutherland House  As her parents were professionals – her father a prominent lawyer, her mother a schoolteacher – there were standards to live up to, but the family were not part of any island elite, she says. “Grenada is a small community, so the structures are not so defined, not like in England,” although she describes Grenadians at the time as more class conscious than colour conscious. “Most of us were of mixed blood,” she says, and describes her own heritage as including African, Scottish, Flemish and Carib Indian.  The radio was Hosten’s main window into a world beyond Grenada, and after leaving school, she pursued a career in broadcasting, eventually travelling to London, aged 18, to enrol on a BBC training scheme. After nearly two years in the UK, and six months as an au pair in France, she returned to Grenada a cosmopolitan, bilingual, polished woman of 20 – an ideal candidate to work as a flight attendant for British West Indies Airways.  It was in this role that a series of events – “what you might consider coincidences, which I don’t think are coincidences, really” – propelled her towards her date with destiny at the Royal Albert Hall. There was a fateful in-flight meeting with the recently crowned Miss Guyana; happening to pick up a discarded newspaper reporting Grenada’s plans to send a representative to Miss World; and bumping into an old friend whose mother was the head of Grenada’s tourist board. He persuaded Hosten to compete, suggesting Miss World would be no different from the traditional carnival queen contests she had participated in as a teenager. “They were never really about beauty. They were always more about promoting the culture of the island,” she says. “Throughout the Caribbean, you were considered ‘attractive’, rather than ‘beautiful’; and that meant that you had a nice smile, that you presented yourself well.”  I can’t believe that’s how I answered questions! It makes you cringe, you know?  Miss World was very different. “The objectification was exemplified by having to turn around for your backside to be judged,” she says. “Even back then, it was shocking, because I never had to do that in Grenada. And it was shocking to my daughter, who later saw the contest. She was embarrassed for me. She said: ‘Oh Mum, I can’t imagine that you had to do that!’” Hosten is also a little embarrassed for her younger self, watching the footage back. “It seems so corny. I can’t believe that’s how I answered questions! It makes you cringe, you know? But that’s what it was.”  Her win made the front pages around the world, but Hosten was disturbed by the tone of much of the reporting. “The first time I ever saw myself as a minority was when I came to England for Miss World, because the day after I won, the headline was: Miss World is Black,” she says. “I found it shocking that your colour or race should be a headline … because even if they thought of me as Black, was that the most important thing for them to be highlighting?”  The same articles often included allegations that the contest must have been rigged, since the judging panel included the Grenadian premier, Eric Gairy. Hosten found this risible: “There were three British judges, there was also an African judge, a judge from Denmark, I think there was a judge from India … and all of a sudden, the one from Grenada should have made the difference?” It seemed to her the fuss was a cover for their true objections: “It was really because there were two women of colour [Pearl Jansen, Miss Africa South, placed second], and the fact that I wasn’t the standard European type of winner. [In their minds] I could not possibly, naturally, have been able to win. It was hurtful.”  Protesters invade the Royal Albert Hall during the 1970 Miss World contest. Photograph: Leonard Burt/Getty Images  Coming face to face with the women’s lib protesters was, by comparison, less disconcerting. When crowds singing the protest song We Shall Overcome accosted an official Miss World coach en route to the Royal Albert Hall that day, she remembers some of the contestants on board joined in the singing. “Well, at one level we thought, this is a women’s demonstration, and we’re women.” Hosten says she agreed with much of what the UK women’s liberation movement had to say, but they made one great tactical error: “They never reached out to us at any point in time, to explain anything about what they were trying to achieve, or who they were against.”  If they had, she would have tried to describe to them her experience – as a woman of colour from one of the smallest nations in the world – and how it might differ from theirs, as white women in the UK. “I was able to represent women that really had not had an opportunity like this. And let’s be frank: it was a stepping stone for most of us. I never saw myself as a beauty contest winner, really. I saw it as an opportunity, which I took, to have an experience, and to make some money!”  At that time, the simple fact of a Black woman being proclaimed the world’s “most beautiful” sent a powerfully countercultural message. While the “Black is beautiful” movement had been challenging internalised racism among African Americans since the early 1960s, in much of the western world the existence of women with darker skin tones or afro hair textures was ignored by the media and the cosmetics industry. “It was always a job to find something that would really complement my skin,” says Hosten. “When I won, no cosmetic companies or hair product companies contacted me to advertise for them, as they had done for previous Miss Worlds.”  Hosten realised she was also carrying a banner for long underrepresented women of colour from all over the world: “I think I was one of the first Miss Worlds to be invited to Africa, for instance. I didn’t accept the invitation to South Africa, during the height of apartheid, but I did go to Nigeria, and pass through Ghana, and they were wonderful to me, just like a homecoming.”  Hosten and Bob Hope on Hope’s Christmas tour of US military bases. Photograph: AP  If Hosten’s only goal had been personal advancement, she’d likely have parlayed her Miss World fame into a showbiz career. There was ample opportunity, including all the contacts she made on Bob Hope’s Christmas tour of US military bases. Despite Hope’s self-perpetuated reputation as a womaniser, she describes the man she got to know as an avuncular, if slightly detached figure, who continued to send her a Christmas card every year for decades afterwards. “It was only ever addressed to ‘Miss World, Jennifer Hosten, Grenada’, but somehow it always got to me.” Then there was a teatime tête-à-tête at Joan Crawford’s New York home, which Hosten remembers as a flurry of small dogs and big hats, during which the Hollywood star personally invited Hosten to enrol at her acting school. Instead, after fulfilling her year of contractual obligations, she went a different way.  Many beauty queens claim to strive for “world peace”, but few have put those words into action as literally as Hosten has. A year after Miss World, she married a Canadian IBM manager named David Craig and set up home with him in rural Ontario, where they raised two children and Hosten did the daily commute to her customer relations job at Air Canada on a snowmobile. One day in 1978, however, she received a phone call from Gairy, by then the Grenadian prime minister, inviting her to serve as high commissioner (equivalent to ambassador) to Canada.  Being a woman meant she was expected to be ambassador and ambassador’s wife, combining her diplomatic duties with the full domestic schedule of a mother of two. “I would have to come home and plan the cocktail parties, organise the childcare. I remember an occasion where [former Canadian PM] Pierre Trudeau came to my home and read the children a bedtime story … That was quite special.” Special, but also a nightmare of parenting logistics: “I was the one that had to arrange for them to actually go to bed, and here I was, also the ambassador.”  Any notion that this would be a ceremonial role was soon dramatically disproven. “I was returning from a UN meeting in Ecuador when the government fell,” she says, referring to the 1979 coup in Grenada led by Maurice Bishop, the leader of the Marxist-Leninist New Jewel Movement (NJM) and an old acquaintance from her London days. “I had to very quickly use whatever skills I had, and get recognition for the new government. I think I was instrumental in that, actually.” Hosten stayed on until 1981, through what would turn out to be one of her nation’s most tumultuous chapters. She is critical of the fallen Gairy government, describing it as “verging on authoritarian” and presiding over a long discontented populace: “The people wanted independence [from Britain, which happened in 1974], but they didn’t want independence under that government.” The NJM government, however, soon descended into something “much worse … total abuse of power, the doing away of all freedoms”. In 1983 Bishop was executed by dissident members of his own party, triggering a US invasion. These are events that Hosten is still sorting through in her mind. “There is actually much more to that story that I can tell, that I will sometime write about. I don’t know if they’ll ever publish it.”  With their children grown up and their careers taking them to different countries, Hosten and her husband divorced after 28 years of “a fairly good marriage”. She went on to marry – and separate – twice more and accept other high-level diplomatic and trade roles, including at the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States and Canada’s High Commission in Bangladesh before, aged 60, retraining once again, as a psychotherapist and counsellor. These days Hosten is a proud grandmother who enjoys a close relationship with her family, as well as keeping in touch with the many friends she has made around the world. Throughout all her reinventions, she has retained the grace and sincerity that won her that 1970 title.  Hosten at the Misbehaviour premiere in London, in 2020. Photograph: PA Images/Alamy  In 2020, the events of the 1970 Miss World were dramatised in the movie Misbehaviour, with Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Hosten and Keira Knightley as Sally Alexander, the organiser of the women’s rights protest. It was during the publicity tour for Misbehaviour, listening to Knightley discuss her choice of acting roles, that Hosten landed on a useful analogy forher own sense of identity: “She’s played pirates in the Caribbean, and been in Jane Austen adaptations, and lots of other types of movies, because actresses don’t like to be typecast,” she says. “Well, people don’t want to be typecast … I didn’t want to be remembered just as a beauty contest winner, because there are so many other sides to us.”  This plurality of womanhood is what Hosten hoped – and still hopes – to convey: “I don’t know how far [the women’s movement] has come in the sense of really including the interests of a broader section of women,” she concludes. “But I do think they achieved a great deal and I really have to congratulate them. What, it seems to me, is still missing, is asking: who are we to be limiting the roles of other women?”"

The powerful cyclone came ashore in Myanmar's Rakhine state near Sittwe, with wind speeds of up to 130mph, according to the country's meteorological department.  Figures for the number of deaths in Myanmar - a country run by military leadership following a 2021 coup - have yet to be independently verified.  State media, which is tightly controlled by the military junta, have reported around two dozen deaths and hundreds of others injured due to Mocha.  However, residents of the western region of Rakhine state, where there is a large population of Rohingya Muslims, said at least 100 people had died and many more were missing and feared dead.  Scroll across the before-and-after pictures to see the extent of the damage in the city of Sittwe, where homes have been destroyed, roofs have collapsed and public buildings left damaged.  As much as 90% of the city has reportedly been destroyed, while the area has been declared a natural disaster zone.  Others images show what is left of a coastal road and bridge covered in seawater and dirt thrown up from the storm.  Pictures from inside the town show paths and roads blocked off in the aftermath of the cyclone.  Before-and-after images also show the significant damage to Sittwe University - a technical university focused on science and engineering.  The pictures show a number of buildings on the campus with collapsed roofs and blown-out windows.  In other images, an old lighthouse, which remains as a historical landmark, appears unscathed, while a number of buildings around it appear damaged by the cyclone.  The storm is one of the worst since Cyclone Nargis swept across parts of southern Myanmar - one of Asia's least developed nations - killing nearly 140,000 people in 2008.  Thousands of people living along the western coast of Rakhine state were evacuated or moved into shelters before the cyclone came ashore.  Story continues  But at camps for displaced Rohingya, the presence of aid agencies is spotty and help from the country's military government is negligible.  At the world's largest refugee camp in neighbour Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar district, Rohingya from Myanmar were moved to safer areas until Cyclone Mocha passed - potentially saving thousands of lives.  Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said in total more than 700,000 people were moved to cyclone shelters or makeshift facilities including schools and mosques.  On Monday, rescuers evacuated about 1,000 people trapped by seawater 3.6 meters (12 feet) deep along western Myanmar's coast."

Another shipment was expected in the coming days containing medical supplies.  “Most of our aid supplies were already distributed to people in need, despite some being looted in Khartoum and Darfur,” said IFRC Regional Director for Africa Mohammed Mukhier. “So, this international humanitarian shipment comes at a crucial time as it will help the Sudanese Red Crescent Society to assist people caught between the conflict and the next flooding, which is typical in the country.”  Since the fighting broke out more than a month ago, at least 600 people have been killed, according to the World Health Organization.  The conflict has displaced more than 700,000 people within Sudan, while another 200,000 have fled to neighboring countries, the United Nations said.  The Sudanese army, led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, is battling the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, led by General Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo.  The two generals are former allies who together orchestrated an October 2021 military coup that derailed a transition to civilian rule following the 2019 ouster of longtime leader Omar al-Bashir.  Tensions between the generals have been growing over disagreements about how the Rapid Support Forces should be integrated in the army and who should oversee that process. The restructuring of the military was part of an effort to restore the country to civilian rule and end the political crisis sparked by the 2021 military coup.  Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters."

He aims to turn up the pressure on the ruling junta, and cut off their financial resources, and he sees this week's G7 summit in Hiroshima as an opportunity.  Kyaw Moe Tun has been a thorn in the side of Myanmar's military regime ever since it seized power in a February 2021 coup. He was appointed ambassador to the United Nations under the democratically elected administration of Aung San Suu Kyi and remains loyal to the democratic government in exile.  The regime has tried more than once to unseat Kyaw Moe Tun, but the UN committee that oversees his tenure has so far allowed him to remain in the role, which he is now using to call for international support to restore democracy in his country.  ""The military has committed serious human rights violations amounting to the crisis, humanity, and war crimes,"" he says. ""It includes massacres, indiscriminate and disproportionate aerial bombings, wholesale burning of homes, and destroying our schools and hospitals. So many innocent people, including women and children, were brutally killed by the military.""  The pro-democracy National Unity Government, or NUG, says at least 168 people, including children aged 5 or younger, were killed in the Sagaing region on a single day in April. It is believed to be the deadliest attack since the junta seized power.  Human rights group Assistance Association for Political Prisoners says that more than 3,500 people have been killed by the military since the coup, and the UN's refugee agency UNHCR says nearly 1.5 million people have been internally displaced.  Kyaw Moe Tun gave a three-finger salute at a UN General Assembly meeting in February 2021, a gesture that shows resistance against the military.  Kyaw Moe Tun is calling for an end to the violence and a return to democracy. He says it is essential to cut the military off from its revenue.  ""G7 leaders should urge the international community, in particular the countries in the region to stand firm with the people of Myanmar to stop financial flow to the military,"" he says.  The Japanese government decided in 2021 that it would provide no new Official Development Assistance (ODA) to Myanmar. The Foreign Ministry says Japan provided 1.4 billion dollars worth in fiscal year 2019. But the government also said it would follow through on aid projects already promised.  The ambassador has rejected the junta's demands that he step down. In August 2021, investigators in the US uncovered a plot to assassinate him. But he continues to urge the international community to cut the military's funding sources and sees the upcoming G7 summit in Hiroshima as a chance for those nations to use their collective leverage.  ""G7 leaders should urge the international community, in particular the countries in the region to stand firm with the people of Myanmar to stop financial flow to the military. I just want to urge Japan not to normalize engagement with the military junta when the military is killing its own people and committing area attacks on civilians,"" he says.  Kyaw Moe Tun says he hopes the situation in Myanmar is one of the main items on the agenda at the summit.  ""There are so many pressing issues in the world, from climate change to conflicts, including the Russian aggression against Ukraine,"" he says. ""No doubt G7 leaders will pay attention to all these pressing issues. Myanmar is also one of the pressing issues that world leaders should pay attention to. It already has implications for regional peace and stability."""

Less international attention would usually attach to Turkey’s presidential race but when critical alliances are at stake, results matter far beyond the Golden Horn.  This vote is a reminder that autocracy is not easily dislodged. Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s AKP (Justice and Development Party) has channelled regional resentments, Islamic frustration, strongman fantasies, and grudges against the country’s business and cultural elites to consolidate power for the best part of 20 years.  The result — Erdogan won just under 50 per cent of the vote, putting him in pole position in the run-off in a fortnight — is a setback. But it is not terribly surprising in a country where to be an opponent of the ruling party is an uphill struggle. Visiting Turkey for the past decade, each encounter has featured some conversation which provides a glimpse of over-weening power. Newspaper editors and publishers who refused to toe the line are stripped of jobs and assets. Professional groups who raise concerns about unsafe building practices, the backdrop to the country’s recent harrowing earthquake, find their leaders facing onerous “investigations”. The tax system is routinely used as a weapon against companies disfavoured by a corrupt and economically reckless leadership. The 2016 coup attempt was followed by a ferocious reckoning and waves of imprisonment — and a school curriculum bent since with Maoist determination to write history only as Erdogan would like it to be read.  Like many modern power-grabbers he also has support and the combination of that defiant base and the pre-electoral advantages of media domination, corruption and intimidation have won him 49.4 per cent of the vote. His centre-Left opponent Kemal KÄ±lÄ±çdaroÄlu, meanwhile, has underperformed in this election. Now both parties will scrap it out for the three million or so votes of the third party. It looks like a better shot for the incumbent. Erdogan also has a performer’s ability to hold the limelight. Mocking his rival, who had filmed campaign ads in his modest kitchen, Erdogan took to his party HQ balcony boasting, “Some are in the kitchen, we are on the balcony” and singing to the crowd. All this while insisting that Twitter bans opposition and anti-corruption accounts in the run-up to the vote.  Story continues  In short order, another Erdogan victory would be a headache for both Volodomyr Zelensky and Rishi Sunak, who held talks yesterday to advance UK support for supplying additional weapons to Ukraine to supplement a decisive counter-offensive against Russia — and training Ukrainian pilots to use Nato standard F-16 jets.  Turkey is already the main strategic beneficiary of the war. It serves the Kremlin’s interests by undermining Nato’s unity, helps Russia dodge Western sanctions and reaps dubious construction deals with cash advances to bail out an ongoing financial crisis.  Russia and China are the new “lenders of last resort” in a shaken global system, prepared to spend lavishly to buy loyalty or at least fealty. Erdogan’s prosperity track record is a sham — poor Turks struggle to buy staple goods.  Erdogan has played an advanced game of Risk, leveraging favours from both sides in the war. That is unlikely to change. Crucially, as an early member of Nato, Turkey has a central but often conflicted role in a security alliance on which the Ukraine war outcome depends. The blocking of Swedish accession is a signal of its ability to deploy cunning brinkmanship when its support can command a bidding war for favours and trade deals.  It’s no coincidence that one of the most astute James Bond novel plots, From Russia With Love, is set in Turkey as Soviet-inspired and Western spies battle it out for technological superiority. That fiction has roared back to life, with a 21st-century twist — an authoritarian leader eroding a fragile democracy and a doomed economic model.  That also poses a conundrum for the West — how far to indulge a wayward ally whose values are all wrong but who may re-emerge as key to a vital but vulnerable security compact? The nail-biting election will be decided in weeks. The consequences will resonate across Europe and beyond, down the decades.  Anne McElvoy is Executive Editor at Politico"

It is a remarkable journey for Hagabimana, who just eight years ago was jailed in his native Burundi for refusing to open fire on anti-government protesters as a high-ranking officer of the National Police.  It would also be a historic win in a country where migrants rarely hold official posts and where, less than a decade ago, the extreme-right Golden Dawn party was the third-most popular political force on a fiercely anti-immigrant agenda.  Dressed in a suit and tie, Hagabimana walks the streets of the constituency he is contesting in Greece’s May 21 election, meeting voters in farmers’ markets and cafes.  “I have an opinion about racism,” Hagabimana, 54, now a senior migration ministry official and candidate with the conservative New Democracy party, told Reuters in an interview.  “Racism cannot be fought with words alone. Racism is fought with everyday actions. When the other person is afraid of the unknown, you must give them an opportunity to come into contact with what they are afraid of.”  In a sign that Greek society is beginning to change, another Black candidate, Nikodimos-Maina Kinyua, the Kenyan-born founder of ASANTE, a non-governmental organization helping migrants, is also running with the leftist Syriza party in Athens, though he is seen as having less of a chance of winning a seat.  The district where Hagabimana is running, which includes the poverty-hit town of Perama and island of Salamina, just west of Athens, was a bastion of Golden Dawn at the height of Greece’s economic crisis in 2015.  Golden Dawn later imploded and its leaders were jailed over hate crimes in 2020.  For Hagabimana, it meant Greece had turned a page.  “(Golden Dawn) executives were in parliament. Now they’re in prison. I have faith in the Greek people,” he said.  ‘I WOULD HAVE BEEN FINISHED’  Hagabimana first arrived in Greece in 1991 on a scholarship to study at the Naval Academy.  When he graduated in 1996, Burundi was roiled by a military coup and he was forced to seek asylum in Greece. He studied law and joined New Democracy’s youth wing.  In 2005, the year he received Greek citizenship, Burundi’s 12-year civil war ended and Hagabimana decided to return to help peacekeeping efforts with the United Nations.  A decade later, the country was gripped by protests opposing a third presidential term. Hagabimana, then a National Police officer, refused orders to suppress demonstrators and was jailed and beaten, he said.  Recalling a night in prison, he said: “I knew if they hit me on the head I would have been finished.”  While in jail, a lawyer friend in Athens launched an international campaign for his release. He returned to Athens in 2016, with the help of Greek authorities.  Hagabimana’s agenda is business-focused, but he also hopes to inspire migrants that “they can be equal members of society… and that everything I achieved, they can do more”.  The colour of his skin should not be the focus, he said.  “It is more important to me that I am a Greek citizen by choice.”  (Reporting by Karolina Tagaris; Editing by Alex Richardson)"

Buffett and longtime business partner Charlie Munger have shared their thoughts on what happened. However, at Berkshire Hathaway's 2023 annual meeting, Buffett offered a little more insight into Berkshire's decision on the world's largest contract chipmaker, and what he would be looking for in an alternative semiconductor stock.  Buffett says TSMC is like no other, but...  When asked (again) about selling Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC), Buffett reaffirmed that he likes the business -- a lot. In fact, Buffett said ""[TSMC] is one of the best-managed companies and important companies in the world,"" and that ""there's no one in the chip industry that's in [TSMC's] league, at least in my view.""  You could also make a very solid argument that TSMC stock was dirt cheap the summer and autumn of 2022, and still is, at less than 13 times trailing-12-month earnings. With the entire semiconductor industry expecting a rally in sales in the back half of 2023 and into 2024, TSMC's earnings could be headed higher as soon as this summer, which would make the stock even cheaper (assuming stock price stays the same). That also satisfies Buffett's buying a ""wonderful company at a fair price"" criteria.  So here's the catch: Buffett dislikes instability, and TSMC's location in Taiwan unsettles him. As I wrote a few months ago, it's possible that Buffett changed his mind after the U.S. CHIPS Act was passed last August. After that, the U.S. started dialing up its restrictions of advanced chips and chip manufacturing equipment to China. That, in turn, has led to rising China-U.S. tensions, as well as China's hints it might invade Taiwan to reunify it with mainland China.  Such an event would be disastrous for TSMC, not to mention the global economy and its reliance on the advanced chips TSMC makes.  What does Buffett want in a semiconductor stock?  Buffett said he wants to find that wonderful business in the semiconductor industry like TSMC, but he wants to ""find it in the United States.""  Currently, as Buffett stated, there currently isn't anyone who can operate with the same level of chip manufacturing or financial precision of TSMC -- in the U.S., or anywhere else. Perhaps Intel can pull off a coup and retake the manufacturing crown, but that will be a very expensive multiyear process, if it succeeds at all. At least as far as semiconductor manufacturers go, don't count on Buffett buying anything anytime soon.  But manufacturing is just one area of the chip industry. There are high-quality, dominant names based in the U.S. That said, fair values are tough to come by. There's no way Buffett and company are ever going to invest in an Nvidia or AMD. Charlie Munger has expressed his dislike of companies like this that have to reinvest lots of cash into new research and development to maintain their technological edge, rather than return most of that cash to shareholders.  However, the semiconductor manufacturing equipment makers are one corner of the chip industry that could fit all three of Buffett's metrics. Most of this space is dominated by just five companies:  These businesses have been around for decades and operate in an oligopoly. That means they face little in the way of competition, the entire semiconductor industry relies on their equipment to make chips, and they thus enjoy high rates of profitability.  Applied Materials especially fits the bill because it has the broadest range of tools covering all parts of the chipmaking process, it's valued reasonably (under 16 times trailing-12-month earnings), and it's based in the U.S. And it also pays a growing dividend and repurchases lots of stock.  This is just my opinion on a stock that would fit within Warren Buffett's framework. As it stands right now, Berkshire Hathaway is continuing its aversion to high tech, focusing instead on more industrial companies with well-entrenched business models. If Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing doesn't make the cut for Buffett, I'm not sure any other business in the space will either.  10 stocks we like better than Berkshire Hathaway  When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

He also suggested that Russia is entering a volatile period.  McFaul says that Ukraine's victory should be the restoration of the 1991 borders, which includes Crimea, and that any country that believes in sovereignty, democracy and opposing annexation should support those goals as well.  The former diplomat says that he believes the Biden administration should provide Ukraine with more weapons and faster. ""I most certainly believe that if Putin loses the war in Russia, it will undermine his political standing in Russia.""  McFaul agrees that hoping for Ukraine's victory to cause the Russian regime to collapse is wishful thinking. The goal of the U.S. and NATO should be to restore Ukraine's sovereignty, he finds. He also says that everybody would be better off if Ukraine was given security guarantees and the ability to defend itself against future attacks, suggesting that Ukraine should be able to join NATO eventually.  He harks back to when Estonia joined NATO and how everyone thought that would be destabilizing and anger the Russians. ""But look at what has happened as a result of that. Countries that are inside NATO have not been attacked. Countries that are outside NATO – Georgia is on my mind, Ukraine is on my mind – have been attacked. I think NATO expansion could be stabilizing for all countries.""  McFaul suggests there is plenty of disappointment with Putin among the economic and political elites of Russia, while it is too dangerous to express it now. ""But my prediction is that Putin will stay in power as long he is physically capable. I don't see a scenario where he is overthrown, that a general will lead a coup d'état. I think they're very unlikely.""  He adds that the day after Putin will be a volatile time in Russia. ""Because he will pick his successor, Putin 2.0, without question. But that person will not have the political support that Putin had. They won't have the history of having been in place when the Russian recovery recovered,"" McFaul says, adding that Putin had no hand in that and simply got lucky with his timing.  Talking about scenarios where Russia might become even worse after Putin or fall apart, McFaul says that maybe the leader after Putin might be more radical but they will be a transitionary figure. ""Secondly, the Russian state today is a lot stronger than it was in 1992. So the nightmare scenarios where criminal regimes will take over nuclear weapons – I think that is very unlikely."" He goes on to say that while there is a lot of corruption in Russia, influential criminal groups and private armies, they are all signs of weakness, as Putin would not need the Wagner mercenary group, would not need to hand down lengthy prison sentences [pointing to Vladimir Kara-Murza] if he was beloved and strong.

Small is also infamous for exacting aggressive retaliation efforts towards his perceived political enemies.  For example, Small led a political coup to have John Devlin removed from the Atlantic City Municipal Utilities Authority … in a move so outrageous that Atlantic City Council President George Tibbitt publicly called out Small, saying:  We were lied to by Mayor Small. We owe John Devlin a public apology.  Tibbitt then went on to issue a public apology for Devlin being unjustly removed from the Atlantic City Municipal Utilities Authority. Devlin was the board chairman of the time of ouster.  Devlin presently has a massive lawsuit working its way through the New Jersey court system against Marty Small, the City of Atlantic City and many other elected and appointed Atlantic City officials.  From the Believe it or Not files … tonight, Tuesday, May 16, 2023, political retaliation against Devlin has struck again.  The Atlantic City Board of Education has officially voted to remove Devlin from his duly elected Board of Education seat.  Devlin has now lost two public board seats at the hands of Small. It’s outrageous by any civilized norm.  Devlin is/was the Dean of the Atlantic City Board of Education.  Devlin has had an exemplary attendance record over the past two decades … many of those years serving as Board President.  Devlin has only missed two regular board meetings as of late. He missed one due to contracting COVID-19 and he missed a second regular board meeting because of a death in his family.  Devlin notified the Board Secretary in advance of missing these meetings.  There is a policy in New Jersey, that if a board member misses three unexcused meetings in a row, a board can consider removal proceedings.  It’s rarely done and it’s especially not considered when a board member has a legitimate reason for missing a meeting(s).  I have spoken with Devlin just after tonight’s adverse board action against him. As usual, he did not hold back.  ""They couldn't beat me in an election so they fabricated a frivolous reason to vote for my removal. I don't even know where to start … they even prevented me from seeking legal representation, I didn't even get due process.”  “This is a perfect definition of a whistleblower case … this was orchestrated by Shay Steele and his boss Marty Small.”  “This all stems from when I demanded an independent investigation into how a child molester living in The Marty and La’Quetta Small Home was allowed to work in our district. This matter is under litigation and I will assure you I will have my day in court,” said Devlin.  We published a letter recently hat was sent to Devlin that addressed his attendance … however, nothing about the letter would have indicated that they were prepared to move this swift against Devlin.  Heres the letter.  Harry Hurley, TSM. Harry Hurley, TSM. loading...  Harry Hurley, TSM. Harry Hurley, TSM. loading...  Devlin only received a few hours notice about the adverse action that the board was considering against him at tonight’s meeting.  He wanted to have his attorney with him … but, he could not do so on only a few hours notice.  Devlin does have the option of a formal appeal before the state board of education, regarding the action taken tonight by the Atlantic City Board of Education.  This appears to be an obvious case of political retaliation against Devlin, that will serve him well in his current lawsuit against the City of Atlantic City… As a continued example of political retaliation taken against him.  If this unjust move against Devlin is allowed to stand… It is a big loss for the taxpayers of Atlantic City… As Devlin was the only one on the school buses that was keeping checks and balances on both Marty and La’Quetta Small.  Devlin will be appearing on-air with us tomorrow morning, Wednesday, May 17, 2023 from 6:30 a.m. to 7:30 a.m. in his first interview since his removal from The Atlantic City Board of Education.

No other set of teams can claim meeting in three of the past four Conference Finals. No other set of teams has had the results swing in either direction – a necessity for a true rivalry – with Miami winning one series in six games and Boston winning the other in seven. Maybe the back and forth doesn’t extend into the pre-handcheck era, but you’d be hard pressed to find a matchup with more recent history – particularly when you consider the changing cast of characters over the years.  None of that really matters. It’s just a fun thing to consider before diving into the meat of a series, the reality of which should be stated clearly – Boston was the better team this season. By any measurement, they came out well ahead of a HEAT team that, by the same measurements, would likely be the worst to win a title (they had a negative points differential after all) in the three-point era, statistically speaking. The Celtics may not have been quite a dominant as they were in the second half of the previous season, but their league-leading Net Rating (+6.7) was close enough.  Boston is going to be favored. The projection systems are going to give them heavy odds. Journalists and analysts are going to pick them. It makes sense. The HEAT can win, undoubtedly, but picking them requires discarding much of what we saw during the regular season and choosing to believe in the smaller sample sizes, both in recent weeks and in toughness and resolve that shows up in the late, tight minutes.  The counter argument is that Miami was building something all season long, even if the results were never quite there. Erik Spoelstra saw what happened to his team’s offense against Boston last year, when the shooting fell off and Boston’s switching defense guided (pushed) them into quicksand, and decided changes were necessary in order to maximize their postseason potential. One of the beneficiaries of those changes broke his hand about a month ago, but otherwise it was Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo first and everything else built off of them – their matchup hunting, their scoring, their playmaking, their impact on the geography of the floor.  The offense cratered as the shooting couldn’t sustain the previous season’s results, but there was always a glimmer of something meaningful in the way the team was playing off of its stars. Meaningful in the sense that it would matter in the most important games, if they could just get back to them.  They got back there alright. It took 45 percent three-point shooting, Butler having one of the best series anyone has ever played and Giannis Antetokounmpo missing a few games – not to mention consecutive fourth-quarter double-digit comebacks – but they knocked off the No. 1 seed all the same. They thrived in the grind of the Knicks series, always looking like the better team despite Jalen Brunson’s most willful efforts. And now they have a chance to face the team which spurred many of their changes in the first place.  “We’ve had to find a lot of different solutions for a bunch of different coverages,” Spoelstra said. “That’s the most important thing. You let the game dictate. We still have to get to our main things. We’re aggressive but we also have to move the ball, that’s regardless of the scheme. Cycling through different challenges in some weird way has allowed us to wrap our minds around that.”  Any series against a team that switches a ton automatically becomes a Butler series. It’s a matter of fact, if not record. He’s the HEAT’s best isolation player, one of the best in the league, and you’re going to have to score one-on-one against switches. But now he’s got Adebayo, with his isolation usage pumped up all season, to help shoulder that burden. Al Horford is a brilliant defender – check what he did against Joel Embiid in the last round – who is both well acquainted with Adebayo and trusted by his team to defend him in single coverage, but Adebayo has a couple big games against him last year and averaged 25 against Boston this regular season. Even if the weight of this series isn’t on his shoulders, this is another opportunity, after facing Milwaukee’s drop coverage, to test the theory held season-long that he was building his postseason profile.  “His development has been built for, not specifically any team,” Spoelstra said of Adebayo. “It’s been all of these experiences we’ve had on these deep runs. You need to find different ways to get your best players impactful. There are different schemes. When you play against the Bucks, New York and Boston, it’s three different kinds of gameplans. It’s been 2-3 years of Bam’s iron will of player development. I’ve seen great improvement in his ability to be effective against different kinds of schemes and teams.”  Miami can win this series, they’ll just have to do it in ways they haven’t won with this postseason. Good thing their entire team identity has been finding different ways to win, whatever-it-takes-ing their way through every moment, every second.  WHAT THE STARTERS MEAN  One of the most relevant developments in this series happened in the last one. No, not against the New York Knicks. Against Philadelphia.  Trailing 3-2 and facing elimination on the road, Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla made the call to return to the starting frontcourt combination of Al Horford and Robert Williams. That’s the configuration that kickstarted one of the best defensive runs of the past two decades for Boston last year. But with Williams missing the first 29 games of this season and Boston opening the season at a historic offensive level, Mazzulla never returned to the two-big look for more than a handful of games.  Games 6 and 7 marked the first time in the postseason that Horford and Williams started together, having averaged just 5.2 minutes together in the previous 11 games. The 76ers proceeded to post Offensive Ratings of 89.6 and 95.7 as Boston kept Horford mostly attached to Joel Embiid in his pick-and-rolls with James Harden and brought Williams over from the weakside on any downhill attack.  Celtics Preview: Rob Williams Paint Help  That’s a tough look for any team to score on, even if Boston was essentially challenging Harden to score. With how much Miami has been reliant on Adebayo pick-and-rolls, it’s not hard to see how third-party rim protection could throw a wrench in the gears, especially with good wing defenders chasing the ball from behind – or attached at the hip – and Horford cutting off those dotted line catches for Adebayo just as he did Embiid’s nail opportunities.  Of course, that type of coverage is only possible because Boston was comfortable with Williams helping off P.J. Tucker and conceding that spray pass to the corner – just as they were last year leading to Tucker not being on the floor down the stretch of Game 7. And there’s the predicament at the dawn of this series. Coaches tend to stick with what has been working most recently until proven otherwise. Mazzulla has already stated, on Tuesday, that Williams will remain a starter. With Erik Spoelstra starting Kevin Love, can the Celtics be as effective as they’ve been with what might not only be their best defensive lineup, but their best overall lineup?  On paper, that’s a win for Miami. If the other team is going to help off a good shooter, you let that shooter try to punish the defense. But it’s never that simple. Williams, who is capable of some of the best three-point closeouts you’ve ever seen from a player his size, doesn’t have to concede the same shots to Love that he did Tucker. Boston can stay in rotation, sending an additional defender to the corner and filling in from there. They’re capable of that. Williams also doesn’t have to be assigned to Love in the first place. In Game 1 against Milwaukee this year, Giannis Antetokounmpo – wanting to play a similar free-safety role alongside Brook Lopez – was on Gabe Vincent with Miami otherwise starting two good shooters in Max Strus and Tyler Herro. Those plans went awry, of course, but it was their plan.  It might only take a few threes from Love to force an adjustment, but there are further layers to consider. Say Boston decides to go back to their spread, five-out lineup used for most of the regular season, with Derrick White – or Grant Williams, even, for maximum switchability – alongside the four regulars. That’s a group that stretches your defense out as well as any. They’ll test Love’s defense in space, whether he’s dropping back or showing out off of screens, in ways that neither Milwaukee nor New York could even dream of.  What if Miami adjusts first and moves someone like Caleb Martin into the starting lineup despite Spoelstra’s seeming resistance to doing so with how successful Martin has been with bench groups? The Celtics put Williams on Martin last year during the regular season and to Martin’s credit, he didn’t try to punish the coverage only with outside shots – though he will shoot if left open – and regularly drove the paint.  “Shooting the ball is going to be big for me especially if they’re going to have guys overhelping,” Martin said. “There are multiple ways I’m going to try and be effective and impactful if they’re going to put guys like that on me.”  There’s another layer to this that wasn’t exactly present last time around, namely that with Miami less focused on switching this year they’ve often thrived in this postseason the closer they can keep Adebayo to the rim. That was especially true against New York, when Mitchell Robinson’s presence, plus a decent dose of zone, meant Adebayo could hang around the paint and deter the attacks the Knicks were so dependent on. Boston’s stretch will make that more difficult, but at least with Williams – literally the only non-shooter in Boston’s rotation – in the game that makes it easier for Adebayo to be the same kind of help defender, and rim deterrent, that Williams is on the court to be.  It’s popular to say that starting lineups don’t matter, but with Boston essentially playing a two-big rotation, with Horford and Williams both playing the five, a two-big starting lineup is the cleanest way for them to get to that look. Miami has the personnel options to make it tougher on the Celtics to crowd the paint with length. Keep an eye on how this plays out over the first couple games. Maybe someone blinks first. Maybe nobody does. Maybe blinking isn’t even a battle lost in the long run.  HOW THE TURNTABLES…  There are some stats that you never forget. Even if the exact numbers escape you over time, the meaning behind them linger in the shallow recesses of the brain ready to be called upon whenever the right context presents itself.  For last year’s Eastern Conference Finals, it was all about the turnovers.  On all possessions which started off a defensive rebound or a live-ball turnover in that series, the HEAT scored a pristine 1.30 points per possession. But when they were playing off Celtics scores, either field-goals are free-throws, their efficiency dropped all the way down to 0.94. The effect for Boston was not nearly as dramatic, as they mustered 1.10 points per possessions playing off Miami scores. In other words, turnovers and stops were the source of everything good on offense for the HEAT, which is why there were so many dramatic, snowball runs over the course of those seven games. The Celtics averaged 12.3 turnovers in their four wins. They averaged 19.3 in three losses. Even this season, Boston’s 13.3 turnover percentage jumped up to 18.8 in four games against the HEAT.  The main culprits on Boston’s part were their highest usage players in Tatum and Brown, who combined for about eight turnovers a game, 10 in Boston’s losses. Many of those weren’t just any turnovers, setting illegal screens or offensive fouls or throwing the ball out of bounds. They were direct transferences of possession, often outside the paint, where Miami could quickly take the ball in the other direction. Miami had 21 pick-six possessions overall (turnovers becoming near-immediate transition scores) in the series.  Celtics Preview: Tatum/Brown Turnovers  These things did not happen by accident. Rather, they were a direct result of the intersection of occasionally brute-force attackers and a scheme that specifically shrinks those attacking lanes. In that area, Miami hasn’t changed at all. Whatever pick-and-roll coverage they’re in, they are going to bring extra limbs and bodies into the path of the ball.  “That’s where we find our strength on defense,” Strus says. “We’ll keep being the aggressor.”  The personnel is a bit different, though, and neither Brown nor Tatum have been quite as loose with the ball this year. Among the regular rotation guys in the previous series, Victor Oladipo – who appeared to have timed out Brown’s dribble and gather specifically – led all players with three steals per 100 possessions. P.J. Tucker was fourth in that category, behind Jimmy Butler and Kyle Lowry. What all those players have in common is that they have incredible hands, swiping and grabbing and making the act of turning a dribble into a shot as miserable an experience as possible. The HEAT still have good defenders in their spots – this might be a series for Haywood Highsmith for this exact reason, along with simple one-on-one defense – and Lowry and Butler will create their own brands of chaos, but it’s tough to replicate true First Team All-Hands Team guys.  Maybe this series is different. Maybe Miami doesn’t need to force turnovers this time around in order to produce consistent offense. Maybe they force them all the same, with different players doing the forcing. All we have to go on is past performances, and based on what we’ve seen, and what we know from watching the Celtics play just about anyone else over the past 18 months, the turnover column in the box score might be second in importance only to the one that tells you how well a team is shooting from three. It won’t be a panacea, but it factors into who Miami wants to be.  “We’re at our best when we’re disruptive, but we also feel like our offense has taken some strides,” Spoelstra said. “Against a really good team like Boston, you have to compete at a high level on both sides. It’s not as simple as we’re going to get stops or turn them over.”  DROP IT, SWITCH IT, BOP IT  It’s been a postseason of drop coverage for Miami. Between Brook Lopez and Mitchell Robinson – even with Robinson playing up higher and New York crowding the paint – there have been plenty of opportunities for HEAT ballhandlers to come off a screen and know a shot will be available to them. You could even make the argument that, aside from Butler entering the Konami Code on himself, the confidence Miami’s shooters had knowing where and when they could get shots was the primary driver of the team’s blistering offensive pace in that series.  Al Horford is going to drop, too, but the difference with Horford is that he’s not dropping because it’s Boston’s only scheme. It’s almost calculated, giving the offense a look that Horford can toggle out of whenever the need is there. Just look at Horford’s switch rate, per 100 possessions, by quarter this season:  First Quarter: 6.6 switches per 100  Second Quarter: 7.8 switches per 100  Third Quarter: 8.4 switches per 100  Fourth Quarter: 11.2 switches per 100  That’s not someone who switches because he has to. That’s intentional, saving the bulk of his switches for the moments where protecting the paint above all else, playing the math game, is less important than contesting every shot. The later in the game it gets, the less important your points per possession becomes as simply maximizing your chances of putting points on the board, even on shots of lesser value, is often what wins you games. In other words, you might catch the HEAT getting some solid looks against Horford’s drop early on, but chances are they’re going to have to beat late-game switches one way or another.  “They’re second in switches but that can also play a more traditional drop coverage, so you can’t just prepare for one thing,” Spoelstra said.  Williams, on the other hand, will be in drop most of the time. It’ll look more like New York than Milwaukee, generally speaking, with Williams able to adjust the depth of his positioning while also being a bit more mobile, a bit more quick-twitch than both Robinson and Lopez before him – meaning he can both contest shots while shadowing a ballhandler that might get a stop on him. When Miami needs to stabilize and get a look, this might be where to get it, though keep in mind Boston also has the capability of pre-switching Williams out of those actions as his man gets called up should Mazzulla see the coverage being exploited too often.  The switch is still the thing. Only Brooklyn switched more screens than Boston this season, and you could argue that nobody executes as creative, sophisticated switch schemes as this Celtics squad, just as capable of switching away from the ball as they are on it. Like the HEAT, they also haven’t been quite as good at it this year. A possession featuring a Boston switched screen during the 2021-22 season was expected to allow 0.87 points-per – bordering on silliness. This year it’s jumped back up to 0.96, elite but not historically so. They haven’t been as razor sharp as before, though we should consider that having their backs up against the wall against the 76ers could very well have revitalized said tool.  For all the gains Miami has made with their offense this year – we know what you’re thinking, but it was all reflected more in style and process than in results, with an eye on postseason basketball – they continued to struggle at times against switches, scoring just 0.97 points-per-switched-screen. The good news there is that Butler, considering switches often lead to isolations, produced 1.09 points-per-switch this season as a ballhandler.  Chances are that the HEAT’s offense is going to look stalled out at times. It’s an inescapable reality when you’re playing a switching team hitting their apex. But switching requires an incredible amount of individual ability and team-wide precision, which is why most teams don’t even attempt to switch at the volume Boston does, including Miami after a few roster changes. When it looks bad, the HEAT are going to have to weather the storm. Butler and Adebayo in particular are going to have to break them out of those rough patches with some hard-earned buckets.  But the Celtics of this year have not shown an ability to execute with the same consistency as a season ago. That’s where the HEAT are going to have to make hay, forcing Boston into situations where they either have to execute, two, three or four switches in a row, or – by stacking actions and screens – execute two, three or four switches at the same time. There are seams in there to attack, a defender a step slow to get in front of the ball or a miscommunication in the madness, and Miami is a team more than familiar with forcing teams into mistakes and then capitalizing on them.  In that sense it’s going to look bad for Boston sometimes, too, because if there’s anything this Miami team does well it’s make the other team look bad – even if it’s sometimes at the cost of making themselves look good.  DESERVES GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH IT  With all their shooters and scorers, rather with all their players who can both shoot and score, the Celtics can get a good look at a three just about any time they want. It’s an ability that can sometimes seduce a team as they lose sight of the paint, but it’s a dangerous ability nonetheless. Consistently running a true five-out lineup off the arc is one of the most difficult things to do in this league.  “When it comes to breaking down our half-court defense that we take so much pride in,” Love said, “we’re going to have to make four, five maybe six efforts at some point and some guys are going to be throwing their fists up saying, ‘Hey, I need a blow, I need a break.’ We’re going to have to go extremely hard to get these wins.”  Adds Lowry, “You can’t take away everything. You have to be to work an extra four seconds longer, or an extra three seconds harder or an extra rotation. We have to be on the same page and ready to go.”  Even if they’ve changed a bit from last year, Miami and Boston’s schemes aren’t so different. We’re once again going to learn the answer to the question of what happens when a team that takes a lot of threes going up against a defense which allows a ton of them. Difference is that Boston tends to get cleaner looks – the most catch-and-shoot opportunities in the league – and their Shot Quality (second best behind the Golden State Warriors) is going to routinely be better than Miami’s. There are going to be games in this series where it looks like Boston should be winning based on the differences in shots earned, but Miami might still be the team out in front through some combination of turnovers and offensive boards. Deserving to win doesn’t matter in the playoffs if you don’t actually win, and as the Bucks just learned sometimes a seven-game series is too short a time for percentages to normalize.  Miami’s win conditions in this series aren’t too complicated. They’ll need to force turnovers. They’ll need Boston to miss some good threes. They’ll need to capitalize against Boston’s early drop coverage just as they did against the Bucks. They need to win the possession game, ending up with more shots than their opponent. Their perimeter rotations and closeouts will have to be as good as they’ve been all season. And they need individual scoring efforts from Butler and Adebayo when the switching flattens them out and mucks up their movement actions.  But more than anything, they need to be who they’ve been. Not necessarily how they’ve played, but what this season has made them. Boston is supremely talented, but they have moments at the end of games where they take their foot off the gas. They leave the door open at times when it should be shut. This HEAT group, two games away from setting the record for games decided by five points or less in the regular season and postseason combined, is more than happy to kick doors down if they’re open even just a crack.  Maybe picking the HEAT in this series requires less schematic analysis and a couple more taps of the ‘Believe’ sign above the door. That’s fitting, because that’s what this team has been doing for the past month."

Some of the bullets flew through the windows of the house next door, where there were children. The attack, in which no one was injured, occurred in the Los Jazmines neighborhood in the city of Valdivia, some 850 kilometers (530 miles) south of Santiago, Chile. When Investigations Police (PDI) agents arrived at the scene, the attackers fled. One of the gang members, aged 15, threw a pistol into a backyard as he ran away. The following day, a resident called the police to report that he had found the gun on his property. It was a .380 Pietro Beretta, with a brown grip and a name embossed on it: Augusto Pinochet U.  After running the weapon’s serial number, the General Directorate of National Mobilization confirmed that the pistol was registered in the name of Augusto José Ramón Pinochet Ugarte, the former Chilean dictator who died in 2006. The system also showed that the gun had been reported as lost. The question authorities are now asking is: how did a pistol belonging to the general who staged the 1973 coup d’état find its way into the hands of a teenage member of a street gang in the south of the country?  The Pinochet family lost track of the gun a decade ago. In April 2014, Marco Antonio Pinochet Hiriart, the dictator’s son, reported the pistol missing at a police station in Lo Barnechea, in the province of Santiago, along with 17 other weapons including a rifle and several pistols and revolvers. There are around 770,000 registered firearms in Chile. Of those added to the registry over the last three years, at least 60% have been reported as lost or stolen, chief prosecutor of the North Central Metropolitan Region, Tania Sironvalle, said in an interview last November.  Pinochet's name engraved on the pistol grip. PDI Chile  Marco Antonio Pinochet noticed the missing weapons when he decided to make an inventory of his late father’s objects in what had been his residence during his final days, a property located in the municipality of Lo Barnechea, one of the most affluent areas of the Chilean capital. According to the police report, as quoted by the newspaper La Tercera, the fourth of the dictator’s five sons said “a large number of weapons of different brands and calibers were missing, and that they were duly registered with a collector’s description and one of them was defined as a weapon for personal defense.” According to sources familiar with the case, Marco Antonio told the police it was a case of “misappropriation.”  At the end of 2014, Lucía Hiriart, Pinochet’s widow, sold the mansion where the former dictator resided from 2000 following his return to Chile after being arrested in London. The following year, the new owners — who bought the home for $1.6 million — demolished the 1,500 square meter property to build a condominium.  Almost three months after the complaint lodged by Marco Antonio Pinochet, the Eastern Metropolitan Prosecutor’s Office ruled out investigating the case due to a lack of evidence. However, now that Pinochet’s Beretta pistol has resurfaced as part of a criminal investigation, the original case has been reopened. The Regional Prosecutor’s Office of Los Ríos, led by Juan Agustín Meléndez, has decided to separate the investigation of the attack on the house in Los Jazmines into two branches: one will deal with the two rival gangs of drug traffickers, in which 10 people have already been arrested, and the other will work toward solving the theft of Pinochet’s small personal armory in 2014.  The local prosecutor in Valdivia, Tatiana Esquivel, said that the 10 detainees in the gang case have been charged with attempted homicide, illegal possession of firearms and the unjustified discharge of weapons on public streets. Among the charges being brought against the 15-year-old gang member who discarded Pinochet’s pistol is illegal possession of firearms. On the night of the shooting, the teenager was also carrying a black bag containing 26 grams of cocaine and three shotgun cartridges. The PDI’s Anti-Narcotics and Organized Crime Squad arrested him almost a month after the attack, along with nine other members of his gang and a criminal organization known as Población Libertad, of which the son of the woman whose house was shot at was a member. He is currently in prison in Valdivia for drug-related crimes.  Sign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA Edition"

HARARE - Zimbabwe's upcoming presidential election and compensation of white farmers whose land was seized two decades ago are key to efforts to restructure its crippling debt, the African development bank chief said Monday.  African Development Bank (AfDB) president Akinwumi Adesina and Mozambique's ex-president Joaquim Chissano, are leading efforts to help Zimbabwe re-engage with the West to clear its $8.3 billion bilateral and multilateral debt.  ""The success of the efforts we have all put into this process will depend on what happens with the upcoming presidential elections,"" Adesina said at debt resolution talks with President Emmerson Mnangagwa in Harare.  He said the international community will be ""watching very closely"" the vote.  ""The full weight of re-engagement with the international community will depend on this... (and) the entire electoral process that guarantees a credible election"".  ""Success on the political and electoral reforms, and a free and fair election, are crucial to clear the pathway towards arrears clearance and debt resolution for Zimbabwe,"" he added.  Rights groups and opposition parties have complained of a clampdown ahead of elections, whose date is yet to be set.  Chissano, a respected statesman said holding ""free and fair elections"" and settling the issue of compensation for white former commercial farmers were among ""low-hanging fruits"" in advancing dialogue with the West and international financial institutions.  ""Harvesting these low-hanging fruits is critical as they are likely to trigger decisive action towards arrears clearance and debt resolution,"" he said.  Chissano and Adesina last week met members of the US Congress, State Department, Treasury among other agencies to discuss Zimbabwe.  Adesina revealed that the AfDB is working with Zimbabwe to develop ""innovative financial instruments and structures that can be used to front-load the mobilization of the $3.5 billion for compensations"", without getting into further debt.  ""It is important that we find a mechanism to try to fast-track...the payment of these compensations"".  Zimbabwe's late ex-president Robert Mugabe launched land reforms in 2000, grabbing white-owned farms to reverse a historical land ownership imbalance that favoured the white minority population.  More than 4,000 of Zimbabwe's 4,500 white commercial farmers were evicted from their properties, which were given to black tenants.  But in 2020 Mnangagwa, who succeeded Mugabe following a military-led coup, signed a $3.5 billion deal with dispossessed farmers to compensate them for infrastructure developments on their former land."

(MPVA)  South Korea is set to mark the 43rd anniversary of the 1980 pro-democracy uprising in the southwestern city of Gwangju later this week, the Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs said Wednesday.  Some 3,000 people are expected to gather at a national cemetery in Gwangju, 330 kilometers southwest of Seoul, on Thursday to commemorate the May 18 uprising, a watershed event for the country's democratization.  On May 18, 1980, demonstrators, including students, protested against the then ruling junta led by Chun Doo-hwan who seized power in a military coup the previous year. The military conducted a bloody crackdown on them, leaving hundreds dead.  Thursday's 45-minute-long ceremony will be held under the theme of sharing the ""spirit of May together with citizens"" -- a message meant to uphold the spirit of the Gwangju movement to safeguard the values of liberal democracy and human rights, according to the ministry.  It features a performance to console the bereaved families and a video clip of interviews with citizens highlighting their efforts to preserve the ""spirit of May"" and move forward to the future.  At the end of the ceremony, participants are to sing in unison the ""March for the Beloved,"" an iconic song representative of the nation's past struggle for consolidated democracy.  Whether to sing the song together used to be a controversial issue in the past as some right-wing politicians shunned it, in part because it was favored by their liberal rivals.

Each year, the Australia-based Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) produces Global Terrorism Index, or GTI, for 163 separate countries. The most recent GTI finds that, by the numbers, terrorism deaths dropped slightly during 2022. However, much of that “decline” is a result of the Taliban takeover in Afghanistan: since the Taliban is now the government, it isn’t included in GTI’s terrorist calculations.  But the index’s most eye-opening finding? The Sahel now accounts for 43 percent of the world’s terrorism deaths—more than South Asia and the MENA region combined. That percentage is on the rise. According to GTI, two Sahel countries—Mali and Burkina Faso—are among the world’s five countries most impacted by terrorism deaths. With 1,135 terrorism deaths in 2022, Burkina Faso now accounts for more terrorism deaths annually than any other country.  The Sahel is usually defined as the region in West and Central Africa with the Sahara to its north and the savanna to its south. The IEP includes parts of ten countries in their definition of the Sahel region: Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Gambia, Guinea, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, and Senegal.  So why is this region particularly vulnerable to terrorism? Many are quick to blame ethnic and religious conflict made more destructive by the growing availability of weapons from outside the region. But there are other contributing factors that are fueling deeper stressors and frustrations within and between communities. Weather extremes, unpredictable growing cycles, desertification, and diminishing arable land all contribute to the sense of declining economic opportunity that many feel—especially the region’s youth. Instead of using their authority to resolve disputes and build inter-communal understanding, many political leaders, armed with social media, appear all too ready to exploit these pressures for their own political gain. It’s also interesting to note that there have been six coup attempts in the region just since 2021.  All of these stressors open the door for violent extremists—including a number of deadly terrorist groups—to amass more power and gain more followers. Nowhere is that more true than the area where Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger come together. Here there is a growing presence of IS affiliates and Jamaat Nursat Al-Islam wal Muslimeen—a coalition of militant jihadists. But other violent groups, many not formally aligned with outside terrorist organizations, are engaging in crime and violence. An attack on Saturday, April 22, killed 10 people and wounded more than 60 when a bomb was detonated in the town of Sevare in Mali’s Mopti region. Less than two weeks earlier, the Burkina Faso villages of Kourakou and Tondobi near the Niger border, were attacked simultaneously killing 44 people.  With France’s withdrawal of its military forces from Mali last year, Russian mercenaries have seen an opening to increase their own presence and activities in the region. The Russian paramilitary organization Wagner Group is believed to be operating in Mali and Central African Republic. They are also suspected of operating—or soon to be—in Burkina Faso and Chad. And there are rumors of other outside groups taking advantage of the region’s weak governance and lack of western assistance.  During my time as the USAID administrator, our programs in the Sahel region were pointed toward building resilience, increasing constructive options and opportunities for individuals (especially youths), resolving conflict through tailored mediation and reconciliation programs, and promoting messages that affirm peace-and-stability to counter extremist propaganda. While military efforts to counter terrorism are important, it is also critical to work with local governments to increase their responsiveness to citizen needs and counter extremism through opportunity.

It was the 10-member bloc’s third summit since the February 2021 coup d’etat in Myanmar, which pushed the country into a prolonged state of violent conflict and economic decay.  It was also the third summit since ASEAN adopted the “Five-Point Consensus” and created a special envoy mechanism to resolve the crisis in Myanmar. In keeping with the bloc’s current policy, Myanmar’s seat at the 42nd summit remained vacant, with the Burmese junta disinvited to the high-level event.  Despite the policy of snubbing the junta, ASEAN has failed to implement the Five-Point Consensus. One could even argue it has allowed the consensus to fail. Myanmar’s obstinate generals continue to take the bloc for a ride by ignoring the consensus’ stipulations and setting their own terms, definitions, and timelines for its implementation. This obduracy hasn’t noticeably damaged the junta’s already-tarnished image, but it has certainly soured ASEAN’s reputation as a regional organization.  Meanwhile, the current ASEAN chair, Indonesia, has initiated a backdoor process that might potentially break the political and diplomatic ennui over the crisis. The exact contours of this shadow mechanism remain fuzzy, but in the current scheme of things, it certainly indicates forward movement of the glacier.

Can they find a resolution to the Myanmar imbroglio?  The ASEAN Way: A Broken Record?  In the latest ASEAN summit’s 25-page “Chairman’s Statement,” the Myanmar crisis triggered by the coup and the ASEAN’s Five-Point Consensus were mentioned in the very last point, below the Russia-Ukraine war. Beyond noting the recent completion of the Joint Needs Assessment (JNA) and “partial delivery” of humanitarian aid in Myanmar by the ASEAN Coordinating Center for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management (AHA Center), the bloc said nothing new on the crisis. It continues to hold the Five-Point Consensus as its “main reference point” on the issue, despite negligible progress on its implementation.  Advertisement  Save for the recent attack on an AHA aid convoy in eastern Shan State by an unidentified “militia,” ASEAN did not condemn nor mention any other violent incident in Myanmar in the final statement. In fact, the bloc condemned the convoy attack and called for the perpetrators to be held accountable in a separate statement on the very first day of the summit.  In the final statement, there was no mention of the devastating aerial bombing of a large civilian gathering in Sagaing Region’s Pazi Gyi village on April 11, which killed more than 175 people. Indonesia, as the bloc’s chair, had “strongly condemn[ed]” the attack in a statement released on behalf of the entire organization on April 13. However, ASEAN stuck to neutrally urging for “immediate cessation of all forms of violence” in the post-summit statement.  Notably, the bloc also did not highlight the junta’s failure in making any progress on the Five-Point Consensus, which it did in last year’s final statement. However, during the meeting, Indonesian President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo said that “there has not been significant progress” on the consensus’ implementation.  ASEAN appears to be locked in an endless and all but futile cycle of taking cognizance and issuing condemnation. In fact, its repetitive refrains on Myanmar have started to sound trite and unimaginative. This vagueness comes from two places – structural constraints on making hard interventions in Myanmar, and serious internal disagreements on how to deal with the junta.  By now, it is an open secret that ASEAN is divided over the latter. According to CNA correspondent, Leong Wai Kit, a “leaked memo” from the latest summit revealed that while some member states want ASEAN to re-include the junta at the highest levels, others, like Indonesia and Singapore, favor the current boycott policy.  This is hardly a surprise given that the bloc continues to employ a hybrid – some would say, indecisive – strategy of including and boycotting the junta. While the junta remains uninvited to the annual summits, its senior officials have participated in dozens of ASEAN meetings since the coup, including the ASEAN Defense Ministers’ Meetings (ADMM) in 2021 and 2022 and a meeting-cum-exercise of the ADMM-Plus in February. The junta was, however, excluded from the defense ministers’ annual retreat in November 2022.  Ultimately, ASEAN remains awkwardly stuck between censuring and entertaining the coup regime. This has generated widespread frustration and confusion in external quarters, including Myanmar’s revolutionary forces, who are aghast at ASEAN’s failure to hold the junta accountable for its brutality and foot-dragging.

Many of them might want to eventually deprioritize Myanmar and focus on other issues, such as the Indo-Pacific. As a result, Myanmar’s issue with ASEAN might slip into a state of comatose.  The Indonesian Way: A Breakthrough?  Earlier this month, Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi told Reuters that Jakarta had been “quietly engaging key stakeholders in Myanmar’s conflict, as well as neighbors India, Thailand and China in an effort to kick-start a peace process.” She revealed that Indonesian diplomats have had more than 60 “engagements” with parties involved in the Myanmar crisis, including the military junta, ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) and the civilian-led National Unity Government (NUG). Retno characterized Jakarta’s conflict mediation efforts as “non-megaphone diplomacy” designed to “build trust with all stakeholders.”  Advertisement  This came four months after Jakarta revealed that it would use its ASEAN chairmanship to set up a “special envoy’s office” in order to manage the bloc’s conflict diplomacy on the Myanmar crisis. The office was later set up with Retno as its head. Senior diplomats are playing a supporting role by conducting closed-door meetings with various stakeholders on her behalf, while a small coterie of administrative and logistical staff has been handling day-to-day operations.  It remains to be seen whether the office will be carried forward into next year, when Laos takes over from Indonesia as the ASEAN chair. Jakarta might want to remain active in the mediational efforts beyond its chairmanship. However, it has not yet fully institutionalized the office or resourced it to a level where it can become a concrete, ASEAN-level unit. This is a major concern, as the bloc’s rotating chairmanship has come in the way of ensuring continuity and consistency of intent and action on Myanmar.  Since the 2021 coup and the signing of the Five-Point Consensus two months later, this is the first time an ASEAN chair has done something beyond what is understood to be its standard remit on the Myanmar issue. In fact, Indonesia has demonstrated that with political willingness and diplomatic tenacity, progress is possible. Crisis diplomacy is delicate business, and Jakarta’s approach reaffirms the constructive possibility of going behind closed doors to build confidence and create trust where there is none.  Most importantly, unlike India and Thailand – who are known for their own “silent diplomacy” on Myanmar – Indonesia has engaged all sides, and not just the junta, in its shadow diplomacy. This may look like a radical move given the region’s conservative legacy, but is simply in line with the Five-Point Consensus.  Despite this, the closed format has its own downsides. Outside observers do not get to assess the outcomes of the talks. This means there is little to no public accountability. It becomes impossible to assess whether such a process is actually working, or if its outcomes align with the broader objectives enshrined in the Five-Point Consensus. So the risks of expecting too much from “the Indonesian way” are real. Jakarta may be trying its best to find a meaningful, people-centric solution to the crisis, but it remains hostage to more than one restraining factor.  One, Indonesia faces a serious normative dilemma over ASEAN’s non-interference principle, on which the jury is still very much out. On the one hand, Jakarta wants to be principled and seek accountability from a member that has grossly violated the ASEAN Charter. On the other, there is also a limit to what Indonesia can do to seek such accountability. Any wrong move might be seen as conferring legitimacy to one side in the conflict, which could instantly alienate the other sides. Further, fellow ASEAN countries could see Indonesia’s Myanmar diplomacy as idealistic unilateralism, which could then widen existing fissures within the bloc and eventually, dilute its centrality. This is a scenario that Jakarta would want to avoid at all cost.  Indonesia also remains apprehensive of the fact that the Myanmar imbroglio could hijack the entirety of the ASEAN agenda under its chairmanship. Jokowi, during the latest summit, said that the “issue of Myanmar must not hinder the acceleration of ASEAN community building because community building is awaited by the people of ASEAN.” Earlier, Teuku Faizasyah, the Indonesian Foreign Ministry’s director general of information and public diplomacy, in an op-ed for The Jakarta Post, argued against judging Indonesia’s ASEAN chairmanship “solely by the ongoing stalemate in Myanmar.”  Finally, Indonesia lacks the capacity to sustain a comprehensive mediational initiative that is backed by sufficient political willingness and resources. There is no doubt that the Foreign Ministry is keen on moving ahead. But, beyond the Rohingya crisis, the general Indonesian public does not yet see the Myanmar situation as a strategic impediment. This might disincentivize the Jokowi government from continuing to invest diplomatic capital in the crisis. Throw in the fact that Jokowi himself is term limited and will be replaced by a new president in 2024, and the longevity of the current effort is questionable.  A Third Pole?  Besides the collective ASEAN track and the distinctive “Indonesian way,” there is a third regional approach that has emerged regarding the Myanmar crisis. This Track 1.5 approach is primarily led by Thailand and India, Myanmar’ two influential neighbors to the east and west, respectively.  The latest meeting of this “third pole” took place on April 25 in New Delhi as a follow up to the first one hosted by the Thai government in Bangkok on March 13. The Indian government, along with the Indian Council on World Affairs (ICWA), hosted it. Government and think tank representatives from Thailand, Bangladesh, Laos, China, Vietnam, and the former and current ASEAN chairs, Cambodia and Indonesia, joined the Track 1.5. The hosts also invited “mid-level” junta representatives from Myanmar, but left the NUG out.  As per media reports, the participants discussed “reduction of violence, countering transnational crimes, national reconciliation, delivery of humanitarian aid” as well as “creating space for dialogue.” They also agreed to support “Myanmar’s capacity to fight transnational crimes,” indicating a desire to work with the junta on specific issues. According to a Nikkei Asia report, India “agreed with Myanmar to send a delegation to Naypyidaw to help push for a ‘full resumption of dialogue’ between the regional governments.”  Advertisement  Enjoying this article?

It is clear that this third track is designed to serve the interests of Myanmar’s immediate neighbors in South Asia and the Mekong region, who feel flustered by ASEAN’s vague approach. The overall tone and tenor of the discussions suggest that the hosts, instead of finding a solution that respects the wishes of the Myanmar people, only seek to normalize relations between the coup regime and regional governments, including with themselves.  Most of the states joining this effort see the Myanmar situation from a pragmatist-realist perspective, and have resumed normal diplomatic engagement with the junta over the last one year. They also have little track record in seeking accountability from autocratic military regimes. This creates a very narrow and instrumentalist pathway to conflict resolution that privileges geopolitics over justice and accountability. The meeting’s secretive nature also allows its participants to dodge public accountability, not unlike Jakarta’s own shadow diplomacy.  These are serious concerns that Indonesia, or any ASEAN chair, should take note of. Four months before New Delhi hosted the Track 1.5, Retno told The Hindu that India (and all ASEAN partners) should follow the Five-Point Consensus, instead of going their own way on Myanmar. But, contrary to claims made by its hosts, this process appears to be only negating, not complementing, the ASEAN consensus, which stipulates engagement with all stakeholders, and not just the junta. By drawing in only a select few ASEAN member states, further, the Track 1.5 risks widening the cracks within ASEAN.  Overall, there seems to be a clash of views and methods between Myanmar’s immediate neighbors, who seek short-term solutions as countries directly impacted by the conflict’s cross-border spillover, and the ASEAN perspective, which is more normative, although internally conflicted. Yet, even “distant” countries that have felt the ripple effects of the Myanmar situation – such as Indonesia, which has seen an expansion of Myanmar-linked transnational criminal networks – may gravitate toward short-term fixes instead of a comprehensive resolution. Hence, ASEAN needs to reconcile with its own abstractions and confusions before attributing its failures to external entities.  The ASEAN Five-Point Consensus approach, the Track 1.5 process, and Indonesia’s “silent diplomacy” will have critical implications on each other and ultimately, on the dire situation in Myanmar. They may complement each other if all three operate in tandem. But, if the processes unfold in silos, they may end up scuttling each other and doing more harm than good."

(AP Photo/Hassene Dridi, File)  A court has sentenced moderate Tunisian Islamist leader Rached Ghannouchi to a year in prison for allegedly referring to police officers as tyrants in what his party said early Tuesday amounted to a sham trial  TUNIS, Tunisia -- A court has sentenced moderate Tunisian Islamist leader Rached Ghannouchi to a year in prison for allegedly referring to police officers as tyrants in what his party said Tuesday amounted to a sham trial.  Ghannouchi, 81, founder of the Ennahdha party, has refused to be removed from his place of detention for questioning or to attend Monday’s trial, considering that the cases are “political settling of scores targeting opponents of the regime,” lawyer Samir Dilou, a former party leader, said in an interview with The Associated Press.  Ghannouchi, a former speaker of parliament, is the most prominent critic of Tunisian President Kais Saied. He has maintained that Saied’s move in 2021 to take all powers into his hands amounted to a coup d’etat.  Ghannouchi was detained in mid-April on the charge of plotting against the security of the state. He has been called in numerous times for questioning on various matters, but this was the first time he wasn't released.  Monday's case grew out of a complaint by a security union member claiming that Ghannouchi used the word “taghout,” or tyrant, while eulogizing a member of his party at a February 2022 funeral. According to a tweet by his daughter Soumaya, he said that the deceased ""did not fear poverty, ruler or tyrant.”  Ennahda condemned the decision to prosecute as “an unjust political ruling” and called for his immediate release.  Ghannouchi is also being investigated for what his party says is another case of twisting words — allegedly evoking the threat of civil war if Ennahdha and other opposition parties are excluded from the political scene.  His party said on its English-language account that Ghannouchi was charged with conspiracy against state security and ordered to remain in prison pending trial.  “Kais Saied is making a mockery of the judiciary, using it as a tool for political revenge and persecution,” his daughter tweeted.  About 20 other people, including the director of the respected radio Mosaique, Noureddine Bouttar, are currently detained on a variety of charges.  The crackdown on opponents comes amid growing social tensions and deepening economic troubles in Tunisia, the birthplace of the Arab Spring pro-democracy movement more than a decade ago."

According to Saw Nanda Hsue, a spokesperson for the Karen Human Rights Group (KHRG), in the two years following the military coup, people have witnessed a rise in arbitrary arrests, killings, and the destruction of their homes and property by the military.  ""Based on our records, we have observed an alarming increase in extrajudicial arrests, looting, and killings primarily during the period between 2022 and 2023. Particularly in areas such as Brigade 3, Brigade 6, and Brigade 5, there has been a significant occurrence of looting and destruction targeting the homes of local residents, especially those who are fleeing.

Even worse they often resort to burning down their homes.”  KHRG also reports they are carrying out arrests and killings upon encountering people in the area. "" We have noticed a rise in incidents where the public is being arrested, tortured, and killed if they are spotted in any fighting zone. These occurrences are happening more frequently,” he said.  Saw Nanda Hsue further stated that the military forcibly displaced villagers from their homes, arrested them, and employed them as human shields. In addition, airstrikes and artillery shells were unleashed, resulting in the loss of numerous lives.  ""These acts blatantly disregard international humanitarian law and qualify as war crimes. Consequently, We urge the international community to intensify their efforts in implementing sanctions, particularly concerning the fuel supply with a specific focus on airstrikes.

KHRG has made a plea to the international community, urging them to cut off the supply of jet fuel to the Military Council.

The move is a coup for the PFL, whose previous marquee signings have included social media influencer Jake Paul — signed in January — and two-time Olympic Games judo gold medalist Kayla Harrison, who has fought 15 times for them since 2018 and twice won the company's lightweight tournament.  Ngannou will fight in the PFL's Super Fight division, a pay-per-view roster of fighters that gives 50% of event revenue to competitors and was co-founded by Paul, who has outspokenly criticised UFC pay and called for fighters to receive more money.  Part of the reason behind Ngannou's UFC departure was the 36-year-old's desire to compete in professional boxing, with the fighter known as 'The Predator' publicly agreeing in February 2023 to the terms set out by heavyweight boxing world champion Tyson Fury for a bout between the towering pair.  MORE: Follow Francis Ngannou in the PFL on DAZN  Francis Ngannou joins Professional Fighters League  Ngannou's next move has been the subject of significant conjecture during his hiatus since his most recent fight, when he defended the UFC belt he had originally won against Stipe Miocic in March 2021 by beating Ciryl Gane at UFC 270 in January 2022.  Now he will become part of the PFL's tournament format, which works in seasons as part of a knockout competition giving fighters the chance to reach a final with a prize of $1 million (£800,000) for the winners.  The PFL launched in 2018 and has continuously expanded, agreeing major deals with broadcasters including DAZN and ESPN and recently beginning its inaugural season in Europe.  Promotions including MMA organisations ONE Championship and Bellator MMA and Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship are thought to have tried to sign Ngannou, whose UFC deal expired in January 2023.  𝗧𝗛𝗘 𝗣𝗥𝗘𝗗𝗔𝗧𝗢𝗥 𝗜𝗦 𝗛𝗘𝗥𝗘! Welcome to the Professional Fighters League @francis_ngannou pic.twitter.com/WPxuQtJtTn — PFL (@PFLMMA) May 16, 2023  Ngannnou PFL contract: What are the details?  Ngannou will be given equity and chairmanship of PFL Africa, a ""priority market"" for the company and one of six new international leagues the PFL wants to introduce by 2026 to form what it is calling a Champions League of MMA.  He will be part of an advisory board representing fighter interests in a position harbouring parallels with the 'head of fighter advocacy' role handed to Paul.  The deal will be for two-to-three fights, guarantee a ""seven-figure"" purse per fight and a split of net event profits, and afford Ngannou a bonus or salary to serve as a PFL ambassador, according to Bloody Elbow, which also claimed he will have his own sponsors in the cage, no 'champion's clause' or other extensions.  PFL CEO Peter Murray called Ngannou ""the greatest heavyweight MMA fighter in the world"" and pledged support for the fighter's work with communities in Africa and around the world, including his charitable foundation.  ""You have to give a ton of credit to Francis,"" said Marquel Martin, the head of Ngannou's management company. ""Most fighters couldn't go through what he went through this past year.  ""He understands his value and has been extremely patient to get to this point. Now, not only is he the best heavyweight in the world, but he has a deal that is unmatched and will set him up for life.""  Francis Ngannou PFL move: What has the MMA star said?  Ngannou had teased that an announcement was imminent, causing some fans to speculate that one of the most popular MMA fighters in the world might be about to return to the UFC.  He has called his partnership with the PFL ""game-changing"" and described himself as ""very excited"" about the agreement. ""I believe in the PFL's 'fighter-first' culture and global vision, including developing the sport in Africa,"" he added.  Will Francis Ngannou fight Tyson Fury?  The PFL announced that Ngannou will not make his debut for the promotion until mid-2024, leaving the door open for the boxing match he wants in 2023.  One of the reported stipulations in the contract Ngannou has signed is that he will not be exclusively tied to fighting for the PFL.  After Tyson Fury knocked out Dillian Whyte in a boxing match at Wembley Stadium in April 2022, the Englishman was joined by Ngannou for a live TV interview in the ring, when they spoke jovially about a bout both have said they want to happen.  In another interview, Fury said he wants the fight to take place in a cage using Queensbury rules and 4oz gloves, with former world heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson as referee.  Ngannou responded on social media agreeing to all of those conditions, and reports have suggested their showdown is close to being finalised in what would be Ngannou's professional boxing debut.  Whether or not his opponent is Fury — a fighter known for his tendency to talk up huge fights that subsequently fall through — it looks likely that Ngannou will box before he appears for the PFL.  Ngannou next fight: Who could he face in the PFL?  PFL boss Donn Davis has said he wants the 2023 PFL season to be ""the road to Francis"". ""I want to see the heavyweight division fight it out,"" he told Aaron Bronsteter in January 2023.  ""Whoever wins the 2023 heavyweight division, challenge Francis at the end of this year or the beginning of next year.""  2022 heavyweight champion Ante Delija could be the man to face Ngannou if the Croat continues his winning streak in the next stage of the tournament in June 2023.  Delija had been due to fight Gane in the UFC in 2020. The fight was cancelled because of a contract dispute between the PFL and Delija, ESPN reported.  Why did Francis Ngannou leave UFC?  Ngannou had repeatedly said that he did not feel the terms the UFC offered to him and its wider roster of fighters were sufficient.  A three-fight deal had been discussed between Ngannou and the UFC, with a reported offer to fight fellow heavyweight great Jon Jones in return for $8m.  Bloody Elbow said that Ngannou would ""very likely"" have earned more money than he will with the PFL had he stayed with the UFC and not lost his title within his next three fights.  MORE: History of boxing vs MMA: How Mayweather, Shields and UFC stars have fared  However, his PFL deal will handsomely reimburse Ngannou and address the issues he was unhappy about, including a one-year exclusive negotiating window and matching rights clause following the expiry of any contract. He also wanted in-cage sponsorships and health insurance for fighters.  UFC president Dana White said the company had allowed Ngannou to leave, claiming their former fighter ""doesn't want to take a lot of risks"" and ""feels he's in a good position where he can fight lesser opponents and make more money"".  ""In that contract, I'm not free,"" Ngannou told Ariel Helwani about the terms he said he had been offered. ""In that contract, I'm not an independent contractor.  ""In that contract, I have no rights, I have no power. I hand over all the power to you guys [UFC], and I've seen in the past how you can utilise that power.  ""How about those guys at the bottom? They can't really afford that health insurance. I have been there, so it's something I still carry in my heart.  ""I need some respect. I need some freedom. I need to feel like a man. Own my freedom, control my destiny. Decide what I'm going to do. I don't want anybody to decide for me."""

The self-exiled tycoon, a towering figure in Thai politics whose family is the driving force behind the dominant Pheu Thai party, said Move Forward proved social media and user-generated content (UGC) can triumph over big-spending campaigns and vote-buying.  Before Sunday's vote, Thaksin's populist political juggernaut had won every election since 2001, despite being ousted from office three times. It lost to the progressive Move Forward by 10 seats.  ""They used UGC on TikTok because the youngsters use TikTok. It's getting votes and canvassers organically and you don't use a lot of resources,"" Thaksin said during a two-hour political discussion streamed online.  Move Forward had strong appeal and organisation in university towns, Thaksin said, adding many young people convinced their parents to vote for Move Forward.  ""Pheu Thai got hammered because we did not disrupt ourselves enough. Move Forward's trend overcame Pheu Thai and the other parties that had money,"" he said.  Move Forward rode a wave of excitement among the youth generated by its liberal agenda and promises of bold change, including tackling monopolies and amending a law that prescribes long jail sentences for insulting the monarchy, a taboo issue.  Pheu Thai has agreed to form a six-party alliance with Move Forward, hoping more will join to keep the defeated pro-military parties out of government in the coup-prone country.  'WHATEVER WILL BE'  Thaksin wields significant influence despite being in exile for 17 years to avoid a jail sentence for abuse of power, which he denies. He reiterated his plan to return to Thailand in July and asked about prison said: ""whatever will be, will be.""  Thaksin also pledged loyalty to the palace and stressed Pheu Thai would not back any actions by Move Forward that would impact the monarchy.  Move Forward and Pheu Thai trounced parties backed by the royalist military, two of those led by former army chiefs involved in coups against Thaksin and the government of sister Yingluck Shinawatra.  Thaksin dismissed speculation of a secret deal with one of those generals to form a government, calling it an attempt to discredit Pheu Thai using online trolls.  He said Move Forward even won support in districts with large concentrations of rank-and-file soldiers, highlighting a generational differences over the military's political role.  ""For the two uncles, it should be enough is enough,"" he said, referring to the generals. ""Hanging up your gloves has dignity,"" he added.  ""It's a wake up call for the army. Using excessive power is something Thai society rejects. So it added to Move Forward's currency.""

The report, which analyzes the status of religious freedom in every country, is published annually and is an important tool to increase understanding of persecution in its many forms worldwide.  At the release of the report, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken stated, “We defend the right to believe or to not believe, not only because it’s the right thing to do, but also because of the extraordinary good that people of faith can do in our societies and around the world to promote peace, to care for the sick, to protect our planet, to expand opportunity for underserved communities, and so much more.”  The State Department noted that some countries showed improvement in religious freedom in 2022, including Brazil, which passed legislation making it a crime to carry out discriminatory acts on religious practices. Lawmakers in Brazil also codified religious freedom protections for followers of Afro-Brazilian religions, which are minority religious groups who have historically faced discrimination for their beliefs in the country.  And in the Central African Republic, authorities continued to prosecute cases of religious-based violence and other human rights violations against civilians following the military coup in 2003. In July, Idriss Ibrahim Khalil was arrested for his war crimes which led to the killing of multiple civilians, including a massacre in 2018 that left over 100 Christians dead.  Among the isolated cases of improvement, however, is a global trend that speaks to the deteriorating situation for religious minorities around the world. For example, the IRF report raised deep concern for the situation in Iran, where the government routinely convicted and executed protestors on charges of spreading anti-Islamic propaganda. Reports show that these prisoners were given punishments, including amputations, flogging, solitary confinement, and the death penalty.  In Nicaragua, the Catholic church faced government and societal discrimination, including arbitrary arrests, withholding tax exemptions, death threats, and unlawful entry. The anti-Catholic sentiment was further pushed by President Daniel Ortega, who called for the arrest of priests and bishops across the country, labeling them as “criminals” and “coup-plotters.”  And in Nigeria, the report highlighted the ongoing violence against Muslims and Christians, particularly in the northern region. Terrorist groups, militant herdsmen, and criminal gangs continue to target and attack religious minorities, all while the Nigerian government turns a blind eye to their suffering.  In November 2021, the State Department removed Nigeria’s Country of Particular Concern (CPC) designation, a move that drew widespread and continued criticism from human rights watchdogs. CPC designations are assigned to countries that engage in “systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom.”  Under the International Religious Freedom Act (IRFA), the President has 90 days following the release of the IRF Report to issue these designations.

Russia said one missile had hit an American-made Patriot system.

President AMLO said that there was a consensus between Mexico, Colombia and Chile not to give the presidency of the alliance to Peru.  “There are four countries [in the bloc]: Colombia, Chile, Mexico and Peru. And the opinion of the president of Colombia is similar to mine and the president of Chile. He is [also] not interested in giving Peru the presidency of this group called the Pacific Alliance… We can hand it over to Chile, to Colombia and let them decide what they [want to] do, but this lady, with all due respect, [is] a usurper, [who] expelled our ambassador from Peru,” said AMLO in response to a journalist’s question during his daily morning press conference.  President AMLO reiterated that the former Peruvian President Pedro Castillo was unjustly imprisoned because he came from a humble background and he did not allow the conservative forces to plunder his country as they are doing today. In this regard, he suggested that Boluarte leave the presidency to Castillo, who obtained a legitimate victory in free elections.  “I suggest that she resign from the presidency because she is usurping that position and that she gets Pedro Castillo out of jail, a humble person, a teacher from the mountains of Peru and unfortunately in that country as in others racism and classism prevail,” said AMLO.  AMLO once again insisted that he cannot hand over the presidency of the Pacific Alliance to Boluarte because “for us, she is not legally and legitimately the president of Peru.”  Last month, on April 25, the Boluarte government requested the AMLO administration for the transfer of the pro tempore presidency of the trade bloc for the second time since December 2022. Through an official communique, sent to the foreign ministries of Mexico, Colombia and Chile, the Boluarte government demanded respect for Peru’s right to assume the rotating presidency of the bloc “without further delay” and said that “Mexico’s refusal breaches international obligations that affect the prestige of the alliance.”  Boluarte took office on December 7, 2022, after Castillo was removed by the right-wing dominated Congress in a legislative coup, and was subsequently arrested for having tried to dissolve the Congress by decree.  Following Castillo’s forcible removal and illegal arrest, hundreds of thousands of people, mainly from the long-neglected and marginalized countryside of Peru who identify themselves with Castillo, mobilized in different parts of the country. The protesters condemned Boluarte for betraying the progressive ticket she was elected on after she entered into a political alliance with the country’s right-wing forces. They demanded Castillo’s immediate release, Boluarte’s resignation, new elections, and a new constitution.  The Boluarte government unleashed brutal police and military repression against those who took to the streets against her government. According to reports from local media and human rights organizations, around 70 people have been killed in the protests, most of them in violent repression by state security forces.  On May 3, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) confirmed its report that 57 people died in these protests, and said that the state’s response to demonstrators was characterized by the “disproportionate, indiscriminate and lethal use of force.” It added that in some cases, the actions could be classified as “extrajudicial executions” and “massacres.”  Various Latin American political leaders have criticized the Boluarte government for violating Castillo’s political rights as well as the human rights of thousands of Peruvians who demanded her resignation. Mexico President AMLO, Colombian President Gustavo Petro, Chilean President Gabriel Boric, Honduran President Xiomara Castro, and Bolivian President Luis Arce are among those who have explicitly expressed support for Castillo and repeatedly called on Peruvian authorities to respect human rights and not to repress the people.  In the past months, the Boluarte government also announced the definitive withdrawal of the Peruvian ambassadors to Honduras, Mexico and Colombia. Peru has been maintaining bilateral relations with the countries through the chargé d’affaires. Additionally, in January and February, the Peruvian Congress also declared former Bolivian President Evo Morales and Colombian President Petro, respectively, a ‘persona non grata’ and prohibited them from entering Peru, due to their comments rejecting the coup against Castillo.  According to a recent survey conducted by the IPSOS Peru, 75% of the Peruvian citizens disapprove of the Boluarte administration, 79% reject the performance of the Congress, 68% are dissatisfied with the Judiciary, and 57% are displeased with the work of the Prosecutor’s Office."

In our part of the world, the military has played a significant — some might say an indispensable — role in the polity, society and even economy of quite a few countries. In Indonesia, the military under Suharto seized power from its founding father Sukarno and proceeded to rule the country until almost the end of the last century when the country transitioned into a more functioning democracy. Even today, the strong military presence is palpable across Indonesia, although some might say it could become a crucial counterbalance against the impending ""green wave,"" a broad movement of religiously inspired political activism. In Myanmar, the military has been running the country under various juntas since almost the earliest days of independence. The latest military coup happened but two years ago, ruthlessly ending a decade of democratic experiment and reimposing repressive rule by military strongmen. The international community appears to be helpless in resolving the enigmatic, multifaceted Myanmar crisis.  Then there is Thailand. The country distinguished itself in being the only country in Southeast Asia not to have been ruled by colonial powers. And that was perhaps why its military has also entrenched itself in all aspects of Thai society, not least in politics. Successive democratically elected Thai governments were often toppled by the powerful military as soon as the latter subjectively saw the former as being deleterious to national interest, which is often self-servingly interpreted as its interest. In this century alone, democratically elected Prime Minister Thaksin Sinawatra was deposed by the military in 2006, and eight years later, his similarly democratically elected sister Yingluck Sinawatra was similarly stripped of her premiership by the military.  The Thai military's coup playbook is remarkably consistent, although sometimes accidental — to the military mind — results which the military would ""rectify,"" sooner or later. Typically, the relationship between a Thai government with genuine popular mandate that is pushing some reforms with which the military is displeased would see its working relationship with the omnipotent military sour to the point of no return. Then the long-standing or even newly appointed military chief would launch a coup with his brother generals, sweeping the civilian leaders aside. Then after a number of years of outright military rule, the military would supposedly cede power to a civilian government if it's to its liking, sometimes with the same generals shedding their uniforms in favor of suits, with the vested interest of the military having been well-preserved or even enhanced. But sometimes, the supposedly well-controlled electoral results could go awry, and a genuinely popular civilian government is elected. Then the whole vicious cycle would repeat itself.  To forestall the ""unexpected"" and thus unfavorable results, the latest Thai ruling junta crafted a constitution which almost guarantees their continued hold on, or at least their participation in, future Thai governments. A wholly military-appointed Senate was created in addition to the popularly elected lower house of parliament, with the number of senators equal to half the number of lower house members. And then the military gets creative. Thailand is supposedly a parliamentary democracy, and in most other such jurisdictions, the lower house member who commands a majority of other lower house members' support would be appointed prime minister and form the next government. But the new Thai military-inspired constitution curiously provides that the successful prime ministerial candidate must command the majority of the total number of senators and lower house members. As such, unless the democratic opposition wins well over three quarters of the lower house seats, it cannot form a new government, and must work with, or even cede leading power to, the militarily connected parties.  Get the latest news  delivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times’ daily newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy  So, in the latest round of Thai elections over the weekend, a new youth-led party, Moving Forward Party (MVP), unexpectedly won the most number of lower house seats, trumping the popular Sinawatras' populist Pheu Thai party. The military political elite appeared to be momentarily split in recent months, and the two militarily connected parties garnered only the fourth and fifth most number of seats. Despite its second-best electoral showing, Pheu Thai conceded defeat to MVP, but even the combined seats won by these two major parties cannot reach the three-quarters needed to take the premiership. MVP's young and charismatic leader, Pita Limjaroenrat, was educated in the best Western universities, and in a sense brings a breath of fresh political air to Thai politics, wishfully away — from many voters' perspective — from both the military and the Shinawatras. But Pita could possibly clinch the premiership if he is able to round up not only Pheu Thai, but also a plethora of minor parties with lower house seats, to support him and together to form a new civilian government.  But an MVP-led Thai government may again not be in the good graces of the military, especially when the military is not a part of the ruling coalition. MVP put out as its main electoral appeal the ""Three D's"" of demilitarization, demonopolization and decentralization to restore Thai democracy. MVP also promised to end military conscription. All these measures, if really proposed, would no doubt irk the Thai military, and if its previous patterns persist, another coup can almost be expected in the months to come. Such is the relentless fate of modern Thai politics, with heavy-handed military intervention always at the back of the civilian leaders' minds.  Across the globe, as Turkey looks set to enter the second round of its presidential election, a discussion of its implications, not the least to this part of the world, will also come in due course."

Former paramilitary leader Salvatore Mancuso made the revelations during his testimony to Colombia’s Special Jurisdiction for Peace on Thursday.  “At one point a Venezuelan general came along with his son and some Venezuelan politicians to propose Carlos Castaño and I [...] that we carry out a coup d'état with a part of the Venezuelan Armed Forces allied with us to overthrow and assassinate Hugo Chávez,” Mancuso told the tribunal.  Mancuso, together with Carlos Castaño, led the the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC by its Spanish acronym), a former paramilitary group with ties to the Colombian Armed Forces that fought the country’s guerrilla armies, waging a violent campaign in the countryside that claimed thousands of victims.  The paramilitary chief was testifying before the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP by its Spanish acronym), a tribunal established as part of a peace agreement between the Colombian state and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) in 2016. Mancuso delivered his testimony via video from a prison inside the United States after being extradited in 2008 to face drug trafficking charges.  Mancuso, who seeks to return to Colombia, faces a long series of serious charges related to his time as a leader of the AUC. People involved in the country’s decades-long armed conflict who participate in JEP tribunals are eligible to receive special consideration, including reduced sentences, if their testimony is found to be truthful.  The work of the Special Jurisdiction for Peace has grown in prominence as Colombian President Gustavo Petro seeks to implement what his government has termed “Total Peace” in the country after his conservative predecessor deliberately sidelined peace efforts. The AUC itself formally demobilized between 2003 and 2006 as part of a separate deal promoted by former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe, which was criticized for being too accommodating to the paramilitary groups and leaders.  In his testimony to the JEP, Mancuso added that Castaño rejected the Venezuelan opposition proposal but nonetheless offered to send AUC troops to train their Venezuelan counterparts to carry out the coup. In 2004, a group of 50 Colombian paramilitaries was caught in an estate outside Caracas with an alleged plot to assassinate Chávez, who was elected in 1998 and served as president until his death from cancer in 2013.  Mancuso’s claim bolsters accusations of collaboration and coordination between Venezuela’s hardline opposition and paramilitary groups on both sides of the border. Self-proclaimed former “interim president” Juan Guaidó and his allies faced heavy criticism after photos emerged of the opposition figure embracing high ranking members of Colombia’s Los Rastrojos after he crossed from Venezuela into Colombia to participate in US-led effort to force “humanitarian aid” across the border in 2019.  Former US National Security Advisor John Bolton later revealed that the so-called aid scheme was indeed an effort to try to embarrass Maduro and trigger a break in the armed forces, as Venezuelan government officials had denounced.  Guaidó again illegally entered Colombia last month as part of an effort to sabotage an international conference on Venezuela hosted by Petro. It was not clear if he relied on the help of armed actors in the border region once more. Guaidó eventually fled Colombia for Miami and subsequently held meetings with US politicians from both sides of the aisle who reiterated their support for him and Venezuela’s hardline opposition.  Petro has similarly denounced a coup plot by former Colombian security officials, mercenaries and paramilitary outfits. Retired state security officials and reservists staged a protest against the Colombian president’s security policies last Wednesday, with some openly calling for his ouster. Human rights activists in Colombia have long denounced the closeness between Colombian state security forces and paramilitary outfits.  Colombian mercenaries are also accused of involvement in the 2021 assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moïse, with 18 Colombians, many of them former soldiers, having been arrested in connection with Moïse’s killing. The assassination is suspected of being organized with the help of a Florida-based security firm.  In 2020, Venezuela foiled an effort by a 60-man paramilitary force organized by US special operations veteran Jordan Goudreau and retired Venezuelan Major General Cliver Alcalá to infiltrate the country via Colombia with the aim of assassinating Maduro.  The plot, known as “Operation Gideon”, counted on the support and blessing of high-profile Venezuelan opposition figures, despite denials from Guaidó. Goudreau has produced evidence showing the opposition hired his Florida-based security company Silvercorp and has sued anti-government operators for breach of contract.  Mancuso additionally testified that the AUC buried at least 200 bodies in mass graves inside Venezuelan territory in the early 2000s. The former paramilitary chief said that practice emerged after communities inside Colombia started to speak out against the incineration of victims in crematoriums as part of an effort to disappear bodies. Following Mancuso’s claims, Colombia and Venezuela announced that the two countries had agreed to “immediately” work together to help find the remains.  Edited by Ricardo Vaz in Caracas."

He spent over an hour of prime-time television before an adoring crowd — courtesy of CNN — suggesting America should default on its debts (the crowd applauded) and that we should not defend Ukraine from Russia (cheers).  He defended his infamous “grab ’em by the pussy” comments, and called E. Jean Carroll, against whom a Manhattan jury had just found him liable for sexual abuse and defamation, a “whack job” and said her trial was “a rigged deal” (cheers and applause).  All of this was bad enough.  But what really got my attention was his attempt to rewrite the history of his attempted coup: He asserted that Jan. 6, 2021 was “a beautiful day” (more cheers), that the Capitol rioters had “love in their heart,” and that if elected, he’d pardon those who have been convicted (big applause). He denied moderator Kaitlan Collins’ factual assertion that he took three hours to tell the Jan. 6 rioters to go home (more cheers).  He claimed that he never asked Georgia election officials to “find” him the exact number of votes needed to defeat Biden in Georgia. (He did, and it’s on tape.) He claimed that ex-Vice President Mike Pence had the power to overturn the election. (He didn’t.) He called Michael Byrd — the Black Capitol Police lieutenant who fatally shot Ashli Babbitt while protecting lawmakers during the storming of the Capitol — a “thug.” (He isn’t.)  And he reiterated that the 2020 election was stolen from him, and — menacingly — refused to commit to the results of the 2024 presidential election (more applause).  What’s been the reaction to this prime-time squalor?  No Republican lawmaker has condemned it — except for Utah’s Mitt Romney (remember him? He was the Republican Party’s presidential nominee in 2012, as amazing as that now seems).  From the rest of the Republican Party — Speaker Kevin McCarthy, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, other Republican leaders in Congress, Republican governors? Nothing.  What about Democratic lawmakers?  Besides questioning CNN’s judgment in giving Trump the platform, remarkably little.  My sources in the Biden administration say they were “delighted” with the CNN event because it gave Biden even “more ammo” against Trump and will “drive more Dems and independents to the polls to vote for Biden next year.”  Maybe. But what if it convinced more Americans of Trump’s lies? Of his “strength?” Of his baseless convictions?  CNN has gone into overdrive defending itself (and its CEO, Chris Licht) for giving Trump the platform. After all, said CNN repeatedly, Trump is the leading Republican in the race for president and the public has a right to see and hear him. Others in the media claimed it would be irresponsible to “ignore” Trump and “keep him under a bushel basket.”  As if that were the issue.  The issue was CNN’s decision to give Trump exactly what he wanted — more than an hour by himself, with a hand-picked audience, and a single reporter who couldn’t possibly correct his torrent of lies (after Kaitlan Collins repeatedly asked him about his handling of classified documents, he called her a “nasty person,” eliciting audience cheers).  But the problem we face is larger than the silence of Republican lawmakers, the smug tactical response of Democrats, and the blinkered defense of CNN by the media.  Two and a half years after Trump summoned supporters to Washington, rallied them outside the White House, and, knowing they were armed and dangerous, sent them to “stop the steal” on Capitol Hill — where they rioted, threatened the lives of Congress, and caused five deaths — he has still not been held legally accountable.  Yes, he has been found liable in a civil trial for sexually harassing and defaming one woman and indicted for making hush-money payments to another.  But he instigated an attempted coup of the United States in plain sight. Where is the Attorney General? The Special Counsel? The law?  Silence.  Wake up, America!  We are no longer dealing with politics as we have come to understand it — as I have seen and practiced it over the last half century: Democrats versus Republicans, liberals versus conservatives, left versus right. In this old form of politics, compromise was expected and often necessary.  It is now democracy versus authoritarianism.  There can be no compromise. And there must not be silence.  In 2016, Trump was a joke. He is no longer a joke. He has taken over the Republican Party, turning it into an anti-democracy party containing many officials who have bought into and magnified his big lie about winning the 2020 election.  Those who stood up to Trump have now been purged. Most Republican lawmakers who remain have made it clear that they will bend or disregard any rule that gets in their way.  Trump’s racism, sexism, homophobia, and xenophobia have fueled a dramatic rise in hate crimes across America.  His grievances and calls for vengeance are causing the nation to become ever more bitterly divided, paranoid, and suspicious.  He is less constrained than he was before. His lies are even larger. He is even more self-assured in telling them.  His rhetoric is even more menacing. “In 2016, I declared I am your voice,” Trump said at the recent Conservative Political Action Conference. “Today, I add: I am your warrior. I am your justice. And for those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution.”  Yet if the tepid silence from the rest of America continues, he has a fair shot at becoming president again in 2024.  Friends, we do not have the luxury of waiting 18 months until the 2024 election. The danger is now.  We must speak out against Trumpian fascism.  Demand that Trump be held fully accountable for what he has done.  Condemn the media for allowing him to set the terms for appearing, and for magnifying and legitimizing his lies.  Urge secretaries of state and other state election officials to refuse to put him on the ballot — under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which bars anyone from holding office who, having taken an oath to support the Constitution, has engaged in an insurrection against the United States.  And we must make good trouble, as John Lewis put it: Mobilize to protect equal rights and preserve the rule of law. Call out haters and bigots. Take to the streets, if necessary, to defend our democracy."

The Red Devils are said to be keen admirers of Kim, who has turned plenty of heads with his impressive form in Italy to help Napoli clinch the Serie A title for the first time since 1990.  Kim is thought to have been earmarked as the player United want to become their first summer signing when the bidding opens later this year, with Erik ten Hag eager to strengthen his defensive ranks by activating the South Korea international's £52million release clause. It seems as though Arsenal could also be set to benefit from the move if it goes ahead over the coming weeks, with LondonWorld reporting that Napoli have identified former Gunners defender Konstantinos Mavropanos as Kim's long-term replacement.    It is claimed that Mavropanos has already been 'lined up' by Napoli in advance of next season, although his current focus will be to help preserve Stuttgart's status in the Bundesliga as they battle to avoid relegation to Germany's second tier. They only signed Mavropanos on a permanent basis last summer following two season-long loan spells at the club but could be poised to lose him in the not-too-distant future if Napoli manage to tempt them with a suitable offer before the new campaign gets underway.    Stuttgart are believed to value Mavropanos at around £25m, which would see Arsenal pick up a chunk of any transfer fee given the presence of a sell-on clause that was inserted into the deal which saw him join the Bundesliga strugglers nearly a year ago. The move would also pave the way for Kim to join United, which would get the Red Devils off to a promising start in terms of their summer recruitment drive before the Premier League resumes in August. JUST IN: Six stars that won Premier League and got relegated as Jamie Vardy could be next  Arsenal could reportedly be set to benefit from United's first bit of summer business  It had recently been claimed that Napoli were willing to enter into talks with Kim over a new and improved contract in Italy, but everything now appears to be pointing to an exit at the end of the season in order for him to pursue a new challenge in the Premier League. It remains to be seen whether United will be able to win the race for his signature in the not-too-distant future, with Liverpool and Tottenham having also been linked, although they are seemingly in pole position to snap him up ahead of their divisional rivals as things stand.    The 26-year-old was recently given the ultimate compliment by Napoli boss Luciano Spalletti, who labelled him the best defender on the planet and underlined his impressive physical qualities after their victory over Atalanta in Serie A back in March.

Ibrahim Babangida (retd.) in 1990.  Orkar, who hailed from Benue State, and his conspirators seized the FRCN radio station, various military posts around Lagos and the Dodan Barracks, Lagos, the military headquarters and presidential Villa.  Babangida was present when the barracks were attacked but managed to escape by a back route.  In his coup address, Orkar called for the excision of five northern states, alleging that the Babangida regime marginalised the South.  However, the coup was crushed by the Babangida regime and Orkar including 41 other coconspirators were tried, convicted of treason and were executed by firing squad on July 27, 1990.  Related News  The Commissioner for Information, Benue State, Mike Inalegwu, told journalists in Markurdi on Tuesdaythat the decision to immortalise Orkar was taken at the meeting of the State Executive Council.  According to the information commissioner, the State Executive Council, at its Tuesday meeting, declared that everything that Orkar said then had come to pass, hence, its decision to immortalise him.  Inalegwu said, “To recognise one of its heroes, the Executive Council today decided to name a 9km township road that burst out at Apir after the late Major Gideon Orkar.  “When Orkar came out with that broadcast, nobody took it seriously but today all that Orkar said in that broadcast has come to pass. So, we, in Benue State, have come to realise that Orkar meant well for this country.  “So, in the council meeting today, we resolved that a street should be named after Gideon Orkar and that is to tell Nigerians that Orkar had prophesied about what the country is facing today and unfortunately, he was executed. The 9.7km road that bursts out at Apir will be named after Gideon Orkar.”"

According to the Times, Arsenal are far from content to rest on their laurels this summer. The Gunners are in no mood to sit back and admire the progress they’ve made this term and as such, are gearing up for a blockbuster transfer window.  Indeed, the publication report Arsenal have given Arteta the greenlight to sign West Ham captain, Declan Rice, and Brighton midfielder, Moises Caicedo.  The latter was a transfer target for the Gunners in January, though despite lodging sizeable bids, neither Arsenal or Chelsea could convince Brighton to cash in.  The situation could be different at season’s end and Arsenal are prepared to go above and beyond from a financial perspective to get deals done.  The Times report Arsenal’s summer spend ‘may exceed £200m’ when all is said and done. Rice and Caicedo are up first and per the report, will cost a combined £170m. The breakdown is speculated to be roughly £100m (including add-ons) for Rice and around £70m for Caicedo.  To free up both funds and squad space for the colossal outlay, the report names four first-team stars who could be sold.  Centre-back, Rob Holding, midfielder Granit Xhaka and attackers Emile Smith Rowe and Folarin Balogun are the quartet in question.  Of that foursome, it’s Xhaka who already has his next move lined up.  Xhaka nearing four-year deal with Leverkusen  Indeed, Sky Germany’s Florian Plettenberg brought news of Bayer Leverkusen lining the 30-year-old up. Their manager, Xabi Alonso, reportedly views Xhaka as a ‘top leader’ leader who can add a missing ingredient to his side.  Not long after, Fabrizio Romano tweeted a move to Leverkusen is quickly taking shape.  The trusted reporter noted Xhaka is “set to leave Arsenal at the end of the season”. A new contract is out of the question and both his and Arsenal’s plan is to sever ties.  Romano added Leverkusen are in “advanced” discussions over the deal and an agreement on personal terms is close. A four-year deal running until 2027 will be signed.  Story continues  Arsenal are primed to pocket around €15m (approx. £13m) from the sale. That is a far cry from the roughly £30m he was signed for from Borussia Monchengladbach in 2017, though is merely a by-product of the fact he’s now the wrong side of 30.  Xhaka is the first high profile exit on the agenda at the Emirates, though won’t be the last.  The Times named Holding, Smith Rowe and Balogun who were also present on a 14-man out-list, as reported by Goal.

With the country’s four mobile service providers now either directly or indirectly linked to Myanmar’s military, sensitive user data is more easily accessible and could be used to persecute opposition voices, experts say.  “The military in Myanmar has continued to oppress human rights online in the face of ongoing civil disobedience, political opposition, and armed conflict,” Freedom House researcher Kian Vesteinsson said.  The consolidation of mobile service providers means “people lose out on being able to express themselves freely or enjoy the privacy of their communications,” he said. “The distinct risk here is source safety and the safety of journalists.”  Since the coup, Myanmar’s military has killed more than 3,500 people, and over 17,900 remain detained for resisting the coup, according to the human rights research group, Assistance Association for Political Prisoners.  The U.N. Human Rights Office has said that the military’s actions, including airstrikes, likely amount to crimes against humanity and war crimes.  Consolidating control over mobile service providers is part of the military's broader strategy to monitor and censor the internet, according to experts and journalists.  Kyaw Hsan Hlaing, a freelance reporter who left Myanmar after the coup, believes media are at risk.  “For sure, independent media workers and journalists are the most at target,” said Kyaw Hsan Hlaing, who is now based in Hawaii.  Myanmar’s military did not reply to VOA’s request for comment about its use of telecommunication companies to track people in the country.  Myanmar has four mobile service providers: Mytel, ATOM, Ooredoo and MPT. Before the coup, the military already owned Mytel and MPT. Following the coup, ATOM — formerly the Myanmar operation of Norwegian telecom giant Telenor — and Qatari-owned Ooredoo’s Myanmar operation came under ownership of junta-affiliated firms, according to media reports.  But even before the coup, telecom and internet service providers had been ordered to install intercept spyware that could give the military power to listen in on calls, view texts and web traffic including emails, and to track user location, Reuters reported.  In Myanmar, telecom company ownership is shrouded in layers of secrecy. “It’s purposefully opaque,” says Oliver Spencer, an adviser at the group Free Expression Myanmar.  A former Myanmar telecom company employee, however, told VOA that to a certain extent, it doesn’t matter that all four companies are now linked to the military to varying degrees. The employee requested that their name and former company be withheld for safety reasons.  “In this current period, it doesn’t matter who owns or how linked the company is to the military. The response of the companies would be identical,” they said. “Compliance is the result.”  In an email to VOA, ATOM’s communications team said the telecom company respects its customers’ rights and privacy.  “ATOM Myanmar will never facilitate or allow unlawful interception requests or equipment,” ATOM said. “Our telecom operation will always act in a law-abiding, ethical manner.”  “We continue to provide essential communication services to the people of Myanmar while respecting local and international laws; upholding human rights; and advocating for consumer protection regulations, especially in terms of data security, data resilience, privacy, connectivity, roaming, internet access, and others,” ATOM said.  The other three telecom companies did not reply to VOA’s requests for comment.  The military is most interested in accessing the user data of potential political opponents, resistance members and journalists as part of its broader effort to squash dissent, analysts believe.  That data can include details on who a user texts or calls, the length of calls, location data, and contents of unencrypted messages. Sometimes data can even reveal website history and whether a user is using a VPN.  “All types of data requests that you can dream of — it’s all done here,” the former employee said.  All the military needs is a phone number. That allows them to track who else that individual calls and texts, according to Spencer. “They’re basically enabling the military to spy on their customers,” he said.  A former journalist, who has left Myanmar but asked for anonymity for safety reasons, says that when a reporter’s “mobile number is exposed to police and military intelligence” they are no longer secure.  “The journalists who are living in Myanmar are aware of digital safety,” he said, adding that more and more reporters use encrypted platforms, regularly delete messages, and use two phones — one for reporting and another for non-sensitive use. The latter helps them pass through checkpoints, where police regularly check and confiscate phones.  Journalists still inside Myanmar also often change their SIM cards for security reasons, according to Nu Nu Lusan, a freelance reporter based in Malaysia.  “I don’t have much to worry about since I live outside the country, but my concern is for the sources in Myanmar,” she said. She uses secure messaging platforms to communicate with sources on the ground.  The Myanmar military’s control over technology and the internet with web shutdowns, online censorship, and surveillance has led U.N. experts to describe the strategy as an attempt to establish a “digital dictatorship.”  Although the former telecom company employee said the situation is less risky if users have access to a VPN and use encrypted messaging platforms, “where the internet is cut off but the phone line is not — that’s where the risks are for journalists and activists.”  Across the country, all 330 townships have been subjected to internet shutdowns at least once in 2022, with about 50 townships facing shutdowns that measure more than one year, according to a February report from the digital rights group Access Now.  “I try secure online communication options, but most conflict areas have no internet access,” Lusan said, so sources have to go somewhere with service. “There is no absolute safe communication when I communicate via telephone with the sources.”  All of this means it can be dangerous for people on the ground to communicate with each other and access banned independent news websites, which makes it harder for people to stay up to date on what’s happening in their country and around the world.  “This is the military strategy,” Spencer said, “to create a system of fear.”"

For decades, as Pakistani military remained the force that decided the country's fate, Ustad Daman's mockery stood the test of time; a subsistence of dry humour typical of two Punjabs of the Indian subcontinent, bitterly partitioned into present-day India, Pakistan and eventually Bangladesh after the British left in 1947.  But on May 9, 2023, when hundreds of enraged supporters of ousted Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan pushed through the gates of army headquarters in Rawalpindi, the army, unlike Ustad Daman's poetic assertion, was nowhere to be seen.  Hours earlier, Khan, Pakistan's cricket icon-turned-populist politician, was arrested from a courtroom in capital Islamabad, where he had sought bail for one of over 142 corruption cases filed against him through the Army-run National Accountability Bureau (NAB).  ALSO WATCH | Imran Khan arrest: 9 killed, over 2,000 arrested across Pakistan | WION Fineprint × Days later, after the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief managed to get bail and a two-week arrest freeze following the Supreme Court's intervention, an emboldened Khan launched an even more vigorous attack on the army; recalling its humiliating defeat in 1971 that led to the creation of Bangladesh and Osama bin Laden's killing in 2011 in Abbottabad in an operation by the US Special Forces. Pakistan turmoil: Cracks within the army in spotlight For the first time in Pakistan’s history, action against a political leader inspired a 'mini-intifada' against the military itself. But despite an unprecedented action from Khan's supporters, there is no unprecedented counter-reaction from the army (which history suggests, is usually a coup or imposition of Emergency in Pakistan). Instead, the army was quick enough to ward off the speculations of Martial Law imposition.  The army pulled its guards back, and let the looting of its officers’ homes take place, avoiding bloodshed near key military installations.  But why such stoicism?  Divisions or rifts within the army are now emerging as the most plausible reason behind Rawalpindi's refusal to formally take over Islamabad's corridors of power.  The rift within the army has been evident since General Asim Munir took over as Army chief against officers like Lieutenant General Faiz Hameed, who were seen as more sympathetic to Imran Khan.  ""It would be unwise of the army to take over directly because the situation is so bad in Pakistan when it comes to not just the economy but also the terrorism. Whoever is directly in charge would incur further unpopularity,"" Sharat Sabharwal, India's former ambassador to Pakistan, and author of 'India's Pakistan Conundrum: Managing a Complex Relationship', told WION.  Pointing towards the relationship of ""mutual dependence"" between the army and the civilian leadership, Sabharwal asked: ""Why would they do it when they have a civilian façade from where they continue to operate?"" What lies ahead for Pakistan: Emergency or technocratic government? Immediately after the events of May 9th, a proposal for the imposition of a state of Emergency was laid out in a cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.  A national state of Emergency will give the authority to the army without taking over directly. ""A civilian government can declare Emergency and call the army out and the latter can do their bit,"" Sabharwal told WION.  In the past, the moments of crisis in the chaotic relationship of mutual dependence between the Pakistan Army and the civilian government have led to the formation of technocratic governments.  In a technocratic government, individuals are appointed to the ministries on the basis of their expertise and are not necessarily career politicians. Most recently, between 2004 and 2007, Pakistani dictator Pervez Musharraf installed Shaukat Aziz, a former banker and financier, as prime minister in a technocratic government.  Pakistan has justified military takeovers and formation of such technocratic governments with a ""doctrine of necessity"", which refers to extraordinary actions to restore order even if such actions contravene established laws.  ""The Supreme Court is made to give an endorsement in making an exception to the constitution,"" Sabharwal said, while cautioning that such an endorsement may not come easy during the tenure of current chief justice Umar Ata Bandial.  ""The chief justices in the past have been browbeaten by the army and made to act in their favour. But this one so far has not done so. He would have known that the army was behind Imran Khan's arrest and despite that he ordered his release. He's a bold guy,"" Sabharwal said. A novel outburst against the army Meanwhile, a number of Pakistanis have come out to cheer the way a section of their fellow citizens have brazenly rounded upon the armed forces. This, according to Burzine Waghmar, a member of the Centre for the Study of Pakistan at SOAS University of London, is a “novel outburst”.  But this does not, according to Waghmar, imply Pakistanis are reclaiming their agency or dignity.  Waghmar contends that eventually, Army chief General Asim Munir's hand ""may be forced into declaring martial law"".  “And this would be privately welcomed by the West, even if they publicly feign empathy, for the Pakistani populace,” Waghmar told WION.

Ecuador’s National Assembly has begun an impeachment hearing against President Guillermo Lasso, who stands accused of corruption with regard to an embezzlement scheme involving a state-owned oil transport company.  But the hearings, which launched on Tuesday, could trigger a potentially explosive showdown between the president and the country’s unicameral legislature.  Experts have speculated that Lasso could invoke a never-before-used constitutional clause known as “two-way death”, which would allow him to both dissolve the legislature and end his presidency.  Speaking to the legislators on Tuesday, Lasso maintained he was guilty of no wrongdoing. “There is no evidence, nor relevant testimonies,” he told the lawmakers. “Rather, all there is is information that proves my total, evident and unquestionable innocence.”  In an interview with Al Jazeera, Ana Belen, a member of Lasso’s Creating Opportunities party, called Tuesday’s proceedings, if successful, “nothing short of a parliamentarian coup”.  But members of the opposition have rejected such accusations, calling instead for an end to government corruption.  “This is no coup. We’re not trying to destabilise the country,” Viviana Veloz, an opposition member of the assembly, told Al Jazeera. “It is a response to a demand by citizens, a desperate clamour for a constitutional solution to a problem called Guillermo Lasso.”  At issue in Tuesday’s hearing was Lasso’s decision not to intervene to end an embezzlement scheme between the state-owned oil transport company Flota Petrolera Ecuatoriana and the private entity Amazonas Tankers.  Opponents say the scheme cost the state millions in losses and is part of a pattern of corruption within the administration.      Lasso has denied the allegations, with his supporters saying the president had no responsibility to intervene in the deal between the two companies, which had been struck before he took office in 2021.  “Remember that this contract was signed in 2018 by the previous government,” Belen told Al Jazeera. “Investigators have found no penal responsibility, so there can’t be a political one.”  Lasso has previously hinted that he could trigger the “muerte cruzada” or “two-way death” clause of Ecuador’s constitution if he appears to be on the cusp of impeachment, according to Al Jazeera correspondent Alessandro Rampietti, who reported from the capital Quito.  That decision could happen any time before the vote, Rampietti added.  Such a move would mean Lasso is declaring “the situation in the country is so complicated that governing is not an option anymore”, he said.  “That would mean essentially dissolving Congress, also the end of his presidency and calling for early elections. But he would then have the opportunity to continue governing by decree for the next six months.”  “It has never been done before in Ecuador,” Rampietti explained. “It’s considered an extreme political decision.”  Analysts fear such a move could spark protests similar to those that broke out last year over the rising cost of living. Further instability would rock a country already contending with deteriorating economic conditions and a tide of drug-related killings.  For its part, the opposition believes it has the supermajority needed to succeed in its impeachment attempt. A supermajority is reached with 92 votes out of the 137-person chamber — in other words, a two-thirds majority.  Lasso, a 67-year-old former banker, narrowly survived an impeachment vote last year, with only 80 legislators voting in favour.      Opinions were divided on the streets of Quito, where some citizens spoke in support of Lasso’s impeachment.  “The Congress is representing the will of the people. This government has only destroyed our health and education systems,” Carla Araujo told Al Jazeera.  Others, meanwhile, felt Lasso deserved to serve out his term in office.  “The people, 18 million Ecuadorians, voted, and he won a majority,” Fidel Lopez, another Quito resident, said. “We should let him finish his work.”  On Monday, the Organization of American States also weighed in, calling on Ecuadorian legislators to “offer all the guarantees of justice and respect the rules of due process” during the impeachment proceedings."

Watching it again this past week made me wonder: Is it remotely possible that America’s domestic spies and malefactors – who conspired to subvert and perhaps destroy our republic the past seven years – might also someday feel guilt and shame enough to come clean?  The Durham report on the FBI’s Russia collusion coup lays bare the fact that federal intelligence and law enforcement agencies under Barack Obama cynically conspired to gin up an investigation of candidate-turned-President Donald Trump. While cozying up to the Hillary Clinton campaign, the agency ignored intelligence of “a trusted foreign source pointing to a Clinton campaign plan to vilify Trump by tying him to Vladimir Putin so as to divert attention from her own concerns relating to her use of a private email server.”  The world-class conspiracy, involving an unknown number of unindicted co-conspirators, led to trumped-up charges against former Trump National Security Advisor Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn (who is now suing the government for $50 million for wrongful prosecution); illegal surveillance of a Trump supporter, aided by the phony Steele dossier and by repeated bald-faced government lies to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court; and a two-year, multimillion-dollar Potemkin “probe” by special prosecutor Robert Mueller that hamstrung and further divided America.  All this, despite the fact that Christopher Steele’s own researcher had told the FBI in May 2017 there was absolutely nothing to the dossier. Yet the political operatives atop the agency plowed on in their scheme to destroy Trump and install their preferred political regime.  Does that even sound like America?  Even the far-left New York Times had to admit that Inspector General Michael Horowitz “painted a bleak portrait of the F.B.I. as a dysfunctional agency that severely mishandled its surveillance powers.”  There is a long history and a tragic trail of victims of FBI incompetence and corruption. But the Russia collusion fabrication – an attempt to first swing an election and then, failing that, nothing short of an attempted coup – is the darkest hour of a now wholly discredited law enforcement agency.  Emboldened by their ability to get away with their crimes against the American people, federal intelligence officials more recently conspired before the 2020 election to help Joe Biden by insinuating the damning Hunter Biden laptop was Russian disinformation. To pull off the ruse, they produced a letter bearing the weight of 51 former intelligence officials. And now we know it was all to give the elder Biden cover during a presidential debate with Trump.  It also helped the Biden family corruption story – which, three years later, has fresh legs – to go away in time for the fateful election.  But again, as bad as that was, the Russia hoax is “the biggest scandal in American history, that we’re still living with today,” says former U.S. Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., who was among the first to unearth the conspiracy years ago.  “This changed the course of human history. It changed the course of our elections.”  Undoubtedly. Still, the reason we’re “still living” with it is because the spies and malefactors behind it all can somehow live with themselves, and apparently won’t slink out of the slimy sewers of espionage to own up to their crimes.  They should. And they must.  If there’s a shred of decency, a shard of shame, left inside them, they’ll step out of the darkened alleys of their contemptible crimes to tell their countrymen, the world and posterity what they have done to the nation and to the cause of freedom.  And then they’ll fall to their knees and beg Americans for forgiveness.  I’ve watched The Lives of Others before, but it has a particularly somber resonance today. For, like the East Germans of old, we, too, live under a government that has turned on its own people – at least those of us who refuse to conform to the liberal orthodoxy of the current ruling class and its torch-wielding sycophants bent on breaking down the few doors to power they don’t already control.  In the film, the victim eventually learns that his Stasi spy had secretly grown to care for and actually protect him from government overseers. In a free and unified Germany, the victim later writes a book called Sonata for a Good Man – which he has cryptically dedicated to the spy who came in from the cold.  Could that happen here?

Now, five suspected members of a terrorist group linked to the ""Reichsbürger"" movement are facing trial.  The trial of five suspected members of the ""Vereinte Patrioten"" (United Patriots) group begins on Wednesday (May 17) at the Higher Regional Court in the western German city of Koblenz.  The four men, along with a 75-year-old woman who is suspected of being the group's ringleader, are accused of planning to overthrow the German government. According to federal prosecutors, they got together in mid-January 2022 and called themselves the ""Vereinte Patrioten"". They are now charged with founding or being a member of a terrorist organization.  The group stands accused of wanting to unleash a civil war-like situation by causing an electricity blackout and kidnapping German Health Minister Karl Lauterbach. Their goal: the end of the parliamentary democracy in Germany.  After their planned takeover, the accused wanted to assume control of government agencies themselves. Federal prosecutors, therefore, accused them of ""preparing high treason against the federal government.""  The plotters had been planning to kidnap Health Minister Karl Lauterbach. Image: Tobias Schwarz/AFP/Getty Images  How advanced were the group's plans?  Investigators have described ""concrete preparations"" by the accused, who communicated primarily via a chat group on the Telegram online messaging service and met several times in various locations.  One of the accused scouted targets for attacks on the electricity network. Another planned the kidnapping of the health minister, ""if necessary, by killing his bodyguards.""  To that end, the group obtained kalashnikovs and pistols as well as ammunition. They also wanted to import barrels of explosives from the former Yugoslavia.  Part of the 'Reichsbürger' movement?  The alleged ideological leader of the group is a 75-year-old former pastor and teacher who most recently lived in Saxony. Her writings were found on the blogs of the ""Reichsbürger"" (Citizens of the Reich) movement. They are written in the characteristic style of the 23,000-member movement which claims that the German Reich — Germany under the rule of an emperor — still exists as it did until 1918. The Reichsbürger reject all current state authorities as unlawful.  Open letters the woman is accused of writing on ""Reichsbürger"" blogs are addressed to Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump, or ""the Allies."" In them, she expresses antisemitic thoughts, signed with ""Wilhelm-Emperor-Rex-Descendants,"" implying that she saw herself as a successor of the last German emperor.  Federal prosecutors are convinced that the woman and her accomplices were more than eccentric imposters. According to the group's theory that the German Reich continues to exist based on the constitution of 1871, they would conclude that the democratic order of the Federal Republic of Germany was invalid. Instead, an authoritarian system of government modeled on the German Empire must be reintroduced.  Why target the health minister?  Karl Lauterbach has long been considered a bogeyman by Germany's ""Querdenker"" (lateral thinkers) and ""Reichsbürger"" movements. Even before he was appointed health minister in December 2021, the professor of medicine made countless media appearances as an expert during the COVID-19 pandemic. During these, he advocated for strict measures such as limitations on interpersonal contact to combat the spread of the virus. He continued this course when he entered office as minister.  In doing so, he drew hatred from extremist circles who rejected government measures to combat the pandemic in Germany. Lauterbach remains under round-the-clock protection to this day.  How was the group discovered?  An undercover investigator is said to have played a key role in the arrests of the suspects. He was deployed in the surroundings of the accused for months.  On April 13, 2022, the four accused men were arrested, and the woman on October 13 the same year. Since then, they have been remanded in custody.  If the court finds them guilty, they are likely to face several years in prison.  This article was originally written in German.

The latest round in tensions between Baku and Tehran, whose relations have traditionally been strained, came after the expulsion of diplomats from both countries.  On Tuesday, Azerbaijan’s law enforcement forces arrested people who “were working for Iranian secret services,” the interior ministry, security service, and the office of prosecutor general said in a joint statement.  The statement gave nine names and said several other people had been arrested.  The group was plotting a “violent overthrow of the government and the assassinations of prominent personalities and senior officials,” the statement said.  The wave of arrests follows the detention of six Azerbaijani nationals in a different case in April. They were accused of being “recruited by Iranian secret services to destabilize the situation in the country.”  Azerbaijan is a close ally of Iran’s historical rival, Turkey.  Tehran also fears that Israel – a major weapons supplier to Azerbaijan – could use Azerbaijani territory for an offensive against Iran.  Ties between neighbors Azerbaijan and Iran further soured in January when a gunman stormed into Baku’s embassy in Tehran.  He killed a diplomat and wounded two embassy security guards.  The Azerbaijani foreign ministry blamed Iran for the shooting, a claim that the Iranian foreign ministry has rejected.  Earlier in May, Iran expelled four Azerbaijani diplomats. The foreign ministry said the move was “in response” to Baku’s expulsion of Iranian embassy staff in April."

Along the way, he also received his functional medicine certification and became a fitness coach, which—as he puts it—”allows me to create the perfect blend of corrective care needed to optimize your health.”  To say his downtown Overland Park clinic, Full Spectrum Back and Body, is hoppin’ would be an understatement.  “I’m passionate about digging down to the root cause of the injury or illness to create true regenerative care for my patients,” he says.

In some places land subsidence is 20cm a year. Sea level rises are around 0.5cm/year. The rate of land subsidence is therefore far above that of sea-level rise; in some places, by a factor of 40. The sinking land, combined with sea level rise, increases the flood risk of the city as a whole.  Flood events have dramatically increased over the past century. In 1892, only two flood events were recorded. By 1960 that had risen to five. By 2010 that had leapt to 10.  This increase is not so much related to rainfall as the data for total monthly rainfall between 1860 2007 is flat. Jakarta's increasing susceptibility to flood risk, therefore, cannot be attributed to climate change-induced changes in rainfall patterns.

The Move Forward Party, led by 42-year-old businessman Pita Limjaroenrat, placed first in the election, surpassing most expectations. It squeaked past the Pheu Thai party, which had been favored to top the polls.  Pheu Thai stumbled despite the star power of Paetongtarn Shinawatra, daughter of Thaksin Shinawatra, the former populist prime minister who was toppled by a 2006 military coup and is the driving force behind the party.  “The overwhelming electoral victory by Move Forward and Pheu Thai is a decisive sign that voters want a polity where the people, not the military, decide their future,” said Tyrell Haberkorn, a Thai studies scholar at the Uni"

So if there’s subversion of the result from yesterday which is a very strong mandate we could very well see some social unrest as a result.Scenes like this three years ago helped give rise to these election results: student led protests against the power of the monarchy and military.Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha first came to power in the 2014 coup.The most immediate next hurdle to Pita replacing the prime minister, seen here, is Pita needs to command a majority in parliament. The issue with that, is that the members of one of the chambers of parliament, the Senate, were appointed by the military after the coup... and have traditionally sided with parties led by generals.The progressive parties are calling for the Senate to respect the will of the people.The military says it only intervenes in civilian politics when it has to act to save the nation from chaos and it has ruled out any involvement in the election."

Use Next and Previous buttons to navigate  BANGKOK (AP) — Following a stunning election victory in which they together captured a majority of seats in the House of Representatives, Thailand’s top two opposition parties began planning Monday for the next stage in their bid to replace the military-dominated government.  The Move Forward Party, led by 42-year-old businessman Pita Limjaroenrat, placed first in the election, surpassing most expectations. It squeaked past the Pheu Thai party, which had been favored to top the polls.  Pheu Thai stumbled despite the star power of Paetongtarn Shinawatra, daughter of Thaksin Shinawatra, the former populist prime minister who was toppled by a 2006 military coup and is the driving force behind the party.  “The overwhelming electoral victory by Move Forward and Pheu Thai is a decisive sign that voters want a polity where the people, not the military, decide their future,” said Tyrell Haberkorn, a Thai studies scholar at the University of Wisconsin.  “Voters want a Thailand with free speech, without compulsory military conscription, and where the people’s voices are valued, not something to be silenced or bought,” she said.  Pita said Monday he has been talking to five other parties about forming a coalition government. It would have 309 House seats in total, providing more stability than the 292-seat partnership with Pheu Thai as a sole ally. Parliament selects a new prime minister in July, so has about two months to seal a deal.  Move Forward's supporters drove through the streets of Bangkok on Monday afternoon to celebrate their victory. Pita smiled broadly and waved as a convoy of open trucks took him and other party members slowly through the streets of the old part of the capital.  Thailand for the past nine years has been led by former army commander Prayuth Chan-ocha, who seized power in a 2014 military coup and was returned as prime minister after the 2019 election. He ran for reelection on Sunday, but has been blamed for a lagging economy, a botched initial response to the coronavirus pandemic and for thwarting democratic reforms — a particular sore point with younger voters.  “The sentiment of the era has changed and it’s right,” Pita said Monday. “And today it’s a new day and hopefully it’s full of bright sunshine of hope going forward.”  Earlier, as it became clear his party was taking the lead, he tweeted that he is ready to bring about change as the country’s 30th prime minister. “Whether you agree or disagree with me, I will be your prime minister. Whether you have voted for me or not, I will serve you.""  Move Forward and Pheu Thai are mostly allied in their opposition to the military’s recurring interference in politics, demonstrated by more than a dozen coups it has staged since 1932, when Thailand became a constitutional monarchy, and most recently in 2006 and 2014.  Both parties also favor reform of some aspects of the monarchy, a position that riles the conservative royalist establishment that regards the institution as sacrosanct. Because Move Forward has been more outspoken on the subject, it is regarded as radical in the context of mainstream Thai politics.  With almost all votes counted Monday, Move Forward had captured a projected 151 seats in the lower house by winning over 24% of the popular vote for 400 constituency seats, and more than 36% of the votes for the 100 seats allocated by proportional representation.  Pheu Thai party trailed a close second with its combined seat total projected at 141.  Prayuth's United Thai Nation Party holds fifth spot in the constituency vote and third in the party-preference tally, for a projected total of 36 seats.  Although the numbers place Pita in a favorable position for becoming the next prime minister, he faces a difficult path.  Candidates are handicapped by constitutional rules crafted by the military government to restrain political parties with populist appeals from taking root and upending the long-established conservative order.  The prime minister is elected by a joint session of the 500 members of the newly elected House and 250 senators, who were appointed by the military. The winner must secure at least 376 votes.  The Senate, a stalwart defender of the royalist order along with the army and the courts, voted unanimously for Prayuth in 2019, enabling him to overcome Pheu Thai’s first-place finish and form a coalition government.  There is a strong possibility that Pita will be seen as too radical by some partner parties, and they will have to look for a more moderate candidate.  Pheu Thai’s Paetongtarn is the most popular choice of her party base. But her ties to her father, Thaksin, with whom the military has never reconciled since ousting him in 2006, would make winning any support from the Senate difficult. One of Pheu Thai’s other candidates for prime minister, real estate magnate Srettha Thavisin, would stand a better chance in that case.  There are also fears the conservative elements in Thai politics would again employ what critics consider to be dirty tricks to keep a hold on power. Since Thaksin’s fall, they have repeatedly used the courts and so-called independent state agencies such as the Election Commission to issue controversial legal rulings to cripple or sink political threats from opponents. Such efforts would likely stir up vigorous street protests.  “Is the form of coalition that Pita proposed, with 309 seats, stable enough? In a democratic world, it’s the most stable. But in a world of half-dictatorship that has the Senate as an important variable, Move Forward must lever the Senate with the people’s voices,” said Pinkaew Laungaramsri, a professor of anthropology at Chiang Mai University.  “We have to wait and see whether the authoritarians will dare using their illegitimate authorities that go against the will of the people. If they do that, it’s just creating a condition for the people to go back onto the streets,* she said.  ___  Associated Press video journalist Jerry Harmer contributed to this report."

The progressive Move Forward Party, which gained a huge following among young Thais for its reformist platform, won the most seats and the largest share of the popular vote.  Pheu Thai, the main opposition party that has been a populist force in Thailand for 20 years, came second.  Together they delivered a crushing blow to the conservative, military-backed establishment that has ruled on and off for decades, often by turfing out popularly elected governments in coups.  “This is an unmistakable frontal rebuke, a rejection of Thailand’s military authoritarian past. It’s a rejection of military dominance in politics,” said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political scientist from Chulalongkorn University.  Over the last two decades, each time Thais have been allowed to vote, they have done so overwhelmingly in support of the military’s political opponents. Sunday’s vote – which saw a record turnout – was a continuation of that tradition.  But despite winning a landslide, it is far from certain who will be the next leader.  Supporters of the Move Forward Party react as they watch results come in at the party headquarters in Bangkok on May 14, after polls closed in Thailand's general election. Jack Taylor/AFP/Getty Images  That’s because the military junta that last seized power in 2014 rewrote the constitution to ensure they maintain a huge say in who can lead, whether or not they win the popular vote.  Neither opposition party won an outright majority of 376 seats needed to form a government outright, they will need to strike deals and wrangle support from other parties to form a coalition big enough to ensure victory.  But that won’t necessarily be straightforward.  Dangerous territory  The first thing to know is that any opposition party or coalition hoping to form a government must overcome the powerful voting bloc of the senate.  Under the junta-era constitution, Thailand’s unelected 250-seat senate is chosen entirely by the military and has previously voted for a pro-military candidate.  Because a party needs a majority of the combined houses – 750 seats – to elect a prime minister, it means opposition parties need almost three times as many votes in the lower house to be able to elect the next leader and form a government.  In 2019, coup leader Prayut Chan-o-cha won the senate votes which ensured his party’s coalition gained enough seats to elect him as prime minister, despite Pheu Thai being the largest party.  There are also other threats to the progressive movement’s win. Parties that have previously pushed for change have run afoul of the powerful conservative establishment – a nexus of the military, monarchy and influential elites.  Move Forward Party leader and prime ministerial candidate, Pita Limjaroenrat, attends a press conference following the general election, at the party's headquarters in Bangkok, Thailand, on May 15. Athit Perawongmetha/Reuters  Lawmakers have faced bans, parties have been dissolved, and governments have been overthrown. Thailand has witnessed a dozen successful coups since 1932, including two in the past 17 years.  And the purportedly independent election commission, anti-corruption commission and the constitutional court are all dominated in favor of the establishment.  In the progressive camp’s favor, however, is their large margin over the military-backed parties.  “If the results were murky, or if the pro-military parties got more, then we would be looking at manipulation, trying to shave the margins. But the results are so clear and very difficult to overturn now,” said Thitinan, adding that if there were attempts to subvert the vote, there would be public anger and protests.  Move Forward’s predecessor the Future Forward Party won the third most seats in the 2019 election. Shortly afterward, several of the party’s leaders were banned from politics and the party was later dissolved after a court ruled it violated electoral finance rules.  In the short term, that decision ended the threat from the Future Forward Party. But it also, in many ways, laid the foundation for Sunday’s historic vote.  Youth-led protests erupted across Thailand in 2020 after Future Forward was dissolved and a whole new generation of young political leaders were born, some of whom were willing to debate a previously taboo topic – royal reform.  Those calls electrified Thailand, where any frank discussion of the monarchy is fraught with the threat of prison under one of the strictest lese majeste laws in the world.  Many youth leaders were jailed or face ongoing prosecution linked to those protests. But some also went on to create the Move Forward party that swept to victory in the popular vote on Sunday.  That leaves the military establishment now locked in a political battle with a party that has kept the subject of royal reform on its manifesto.  Experts have said another coup would be costly, and dissolving a party with such a mandate would be “drastic.”  “Dissolving a party is a fairly drastic move. If there’s a way of keeping Move Forward out without dissolving them, then conservative politicians would probably prefer to do that. Because it’s not as strong a step in subverting the will that people have expressed,” said Susannah Patton, director of the Southeast Asia Program at the Lowy Institute.  “But you can’t rule that out.”  See why Thailand's ex-coup leader is showing a softer side ahead of election 02:58 - Source: CNN  Vote for change cannot be ignored  Move Forward’s allure went beyond the youth vote on which it built its base.  Unofficial results showed the party captured 32 out of 33 seats in Bangkok – traditionally a stronghold for conservative parties.  “What this shows is that people who are living in urban areas are really fed up with the government that the military has provided for almost a decade,” said Patton.  “They are wanting to choose something different, and Move Forward is not just the youth party but actually can attract a wider cross section of support as well.”  Move Forward’s radical agenda includes reforming the military, getting rid of the draft, reducing the military’s budget, making it more transparent and accountable, as well as constitutional change and to bring the military and monarchy within the constitution.  The party’s win over the populist juggernaut Pheu Thai is also significant. This is the first time a party linked with ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has lost an election since 2001.  And Pheu Thai’s marginal defeat to Move Forward shows voters’ frustration with the old cycle of politics that pitted populist Thaksin-linked parties against the establishment.  Thailand’s “two party system was already breaking down in 2019, but it’s continuing to break down this election,” said Patton.  In a press conference on Monday, Move Forward leader Pita Limjaroenrat said the party would go forward with plans to amend the country’s strict lese majeste laws – a key campaign pledge despite the taboo surrounding any discussion of the royal family in Thailand.  One of his priorities is to support young people facing jail terms on lese majeste charges, and Pita warned that if the law remains as it is, the relationship between the Thai people and the monarchy will only worsen.  His policies “strike at heart of the establishment,” said Thitinan, and even talking about the monarchy openly “is an affront to the palace.”  The Move Forward leader said Monday that he wants to form an alliance with the four other opposition parties to secure a majority in the lower house.  It could take 60 days before a prime ministerial candidate is endorsed by Thailand’s combined houses of parliament, but Sunday’s vote shows the people are ready for change.  However, if Thailand’s turbulent recent history is anything to go by, that could mean little. The military has shown in the past that it has few qualms about ignoring the popular vote."

The results of Sunday’s general election are a strong repudiation of the country’s conservatives and reflect the disenchantment in particular of young voters who want to limit the influence of the military in politics and reform the monarchy.  But the exact shape of the new government is less clear as post-election coalition talks and behind-the-scene negotiations take center stage.  The results  With almost all votes counted Monday, the Move Forward Party emerged as the big winner. It captured a projected 151 seats in the lower House by winning over 24% of the popular vote for 400 constituency seats, and more than 36% of the 100 seats allocated by proportional representation.  Tailing a close second is the main opposition Pheu Thai Party, whose combined seat total is projected at 141.  The party of incumbent Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former army general who came to power in the 2014 coup, held the fifth spot in the constituency vote and third in the party-preference tally, for a projected total of 36 seats.  Voter turnout was about 75% of the 52 million registered voters.  What’s next?  Who becomes the next prime minister will depend on a vote set for July that includes all the House lawmakers plus the 250-seat military-appointed Senate, whose members share the establishment’s conservative policies. The winner must attain at least 376 of their combined 750 seats.  Opposition parties have criticized the process as undemocratic. It’s a legacy of the 2014 coup and a new constitution drafted in its aftermath that was meant to ensure that the military and the state bureaucracy, the main upholders of the royal order, continue to hold sway.  Analysts have pointed out that a lot can still happen before the Election Commission even declares the results valid, a process that can take up to 75 days and will almost certainly include legal challenges.  In the past, the commission and the courts have used their authority to disqualify opposition parties.  What the opposition wants  Move Forward leader Pita Limjaroenrat tweeted that he is ready to bring about change as the country’s 30th prime minister.  “Whether you agree or disagree with me, I will be your prime minister. Whether you have voted for me or not, I will serve you,” he wrote.  Although he energized younger voters with his progressive agenda, the businessman has alarmed conservatives with calls for reform of the monarchy, the institution that has been traditionally treated as sacrosanct.  In 2019, the Constitutional Court ousted his colleague from Parliament on charges of violating the election law and dissolved the Future Forward party, which then changed its name and leadership to become Move Forward.  It had been supporting amending the draconian law that punishes defaming the monarchy, which according to critics has been used as a tool to quash political dissent and imprison pro-democracy student activists.  Student-led protests beginning in 2020 openly criticized the monarchy, previously a taboo subject, leading to vigorous prosecutions under the law. They were also dismayed by the dissolution of the Future Forward party, which they believed was an unfair use of state power.  Thaksin’s shadow  Pheu Thai is led by Paetongtarn Shinawatra, the daughter of billionaire former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra who was toppled in a 2006 coup.  The power struggle between Thaksin’s supporters, many of them rural poor who benefited from his populist policies, and his conservative opponents has been fought – sometimes in the street, sometimes at the ballot box – for almost two decades.  In the 2014 coup, Mr. Chan-ocha unseated the government of Yingluck Shinawatra – Paetongtarn’s aunt, Thaksin’s sister – as prime minister. And Pheu Thai topped the field in the 2019 vote, only to be denied power when the army-backed Palang Pracharath Party found partners to assemble a coalition government.

Photo: Lillian Suwanrumpha/AFP via Getty  Thai voters made clear in Sunday's election that they want change. The question is now whether the military-aligned establishment will let them have it.  Why it matters: Sunday's result was a political earthquake, not just because pro-democracy parties trounced pro-military ones, but also because the progressive party that finished first, Move Forward, campaigned on the once-taboo topic of reforming the monarchy.  Move Forward leader Pita Limjaroenrat, a former business executive and relative newcomer to politics who studied at Harvard and MIT, introduced himself on Monday as ""the next prime minister of Thailand.""  The twin pillars of Thailand's establishment, the military and the monarchy, have the power to block him. Thailand has seen 12 successful coups since 1932, and parties or candidates have frequently been disqualified from holding office even after elections were held.  But such an intervention would risk ""major street violence"" and create ""an incredibly unstable situation,"" says Joshua Kurlantzick, senior fellow for Southeast Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations.  ""Thailand is the only upper-middle income country that regularly has coups,"" Kurlantzick tells Axios. ""Young Thais are tired of the economy and politics being stuck in this archaic past, run by generals and kings.""  The big picture: Before Sunday's shock result, the election had been billed as a showdown between the military and the Shinawatra political dynasty, represented by the Pheu Thai party.  Parties associated with former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra had won the most seats in every election since 2001, but were repeatedly elbowed out of power by the coup-prone military.  This time, Thaksin's daughter Paethongtarn Shinawatra was on the ballot, facing off against Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who led a 2014 coup and retained power after the 2019 election. His popularity has since collapsed.  Meanwhile, massive pro-democracy protests broke out in 2020, with student leaders demanding reform not just of the military, but also of the monarchy.  That was unprecedented in a country where lèse-majesté laws mean criticizing Thailand's king can result in jail time. Dozens of protesters remain in prison.  In this election, Pheu Thai stuck to its pitch of lifting up lower-income voters but avoided the reform proposals that had energized the youthful protesters.  ""Pheu Thai fought the wrong war, the populism war that it already won. Move Forward takes the game to the next level with institutional reform. That's the new battleground in Thai politics,"" Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political scientist at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, told Reuters.  By the numbers: Move Forward won an estimated 151 of the 500 lower house seats, nearly sweeping the capital, Bangkok. Pheu Thai won 141. Pita announced on Monday that they'll try to form a government with four smaller parties, bringing the bloc's total to 309 seats.  That clear majority could nonetheless be insufficient because a new constitution brought in under Prayuth's junta gave 250 military-appointed senators a vote on prospective prime ministers. If the Senate votes against Pita's coalition, it would be rejected.  But Prayuth's party and another military-backed party only won a combined 76 seats.  Even if the pro-military bloc gets other nonaligned parties onside, it could only cobble together a very weak minority government. That is, unless it enticed Pheu Thai to join forces, though that currently looks unlikely.  What they're saying: Paethongtarn Shinawatra congratulated Pita and said she expects their parties to be able to work ""smoothly together.""  Prayuth said he respects ""the democratic process and the election results,"" a message that's undercut somewhat by his recent history as a coup leader.  For his part, Pita said there would be ""a hefty price to pay for someone who’s thinking of abolishing the election results or forming a minority government,"" adding: ""I don’t think the people of Thailand would allow that to happen.”  What's next: Thailand's Election Commission has 60 days to confirm the results, during which time Pita will likely work to solidify his coalition, while the other major players will plan their next moves."

Zelensky landed by helicopter at Chequers, the British leader’s official country retreat, and was greeted by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. It’s Zelensky’s second trip to the UK since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.  This is the fourth European country Zelenskky has visited in the past few days. He is seeking more aid as Ukraine prepares a long-anticipated spring offensive to retake territory seized by Russia.  Ukraine’s leader made an unannounced visit to Paris on Sunday evening to meet French President Emmanuel Macron, after trips to Germany and Italy, where he met those countries’ leaders and Pope Francis.  A message posted Monday on Zelensky’s official Telegram Channel said: “Today — London. The UK is leading the way when it comes to expanding our capabilities on the ground and in the air. This cooperation will continue today. I will meet my friend Rishi. We will conduct substantive negotiations face-to-face and in delegations.”  The UK has become one of Ukraine’s major military allies, sending Kyiv short-range missiles and Challenger tanks and training 15,000 Ukrainian troops on British soil. Last week Britain announced it had sent Ukraine Storm Shadow cruise missiles, which have a range of more than 250 kilometers (150 miles) — the first known shipment of the weaponry that Kyiv has long sought from its allies.  Sunak’s office said that on Monday Britain will confirm it is giving Ukraine hundreds more air defense missiles, as well as “long-range attack drones” with a range of more than 200 kilometers (120 miles).  “This is a crucial moment in Ukraine’s resistance to a terrible war of aggression they did not choose or provoke,” Sunak said. “They need the sustained support of the international community to defend against the barrage of unrelenting and indiscriminate attacks that have been their daily reality for over a year.  “We must not let them down.”  Sunak will also push allies to deliver more support to Ukraine at a meeting of Group of Seven leaders in Japan later this week, Downing Street said.  As Zelensky visited European capitals, Russia stepped up attacks across Ukraine with drones and missiles over the weekend. On Sunday, Russia shelled two communities in the northern border region of Sumy, the region’s military administration said in a statement on its official Telegram channel. It said 109 explosions were recorded.  Zelensky and Macron met for about three hours on Sunday at the French presidential Elysee Palace — an encounter kept under wraps until shortly before the Ukrainian leader’s arrival in Paris.  Macron’s office said France will supply dozens of light tanks and armored vehicles “in the weeks ahead,” without giving specific numbers. Also promised were more air defense systems, but again details weren’t made public.  More Ukrainians will also be made battle-ready, with France aiming to train about 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers in France this year and nearly 4,000 others in Poland as part of a wider European effort, Macron’s office said.  France has supplied Ukraine with an array of weaponry, include air defense systems, light tanks, howitzers and other arms and equipment and fuel.  France had dispatched a plane to pick up Zelensky in Germany, where he met with Chancellor Olaf Scholz earlier Sunday and discussed his country’s planned counteroffensive.  It was his first visit to Berlin since the start of the invasion and came a day after the German government announced a new package of military aid for Ukraine worth more than 2.7 billion euros ($3 billion), including tanks, anti-aircraft systems and ammunition.  After initially hesitating to provide Ukraine with lethal weapons, Germany has become one of the biggest suppliers of arms to Ukraine, including Leopard 1 and 2 battle tanks, and the sophisticated IRIS-T SLM air defense system. Modern Western hardware is considered crucial if Ukraine is to succeed in its planned counteroffensive.  In the western German city of Aachen, Zelensky also received the prestigious International Charlemagne Prize, awarded to him and the people of Ukraine.  On Saturday. he met Francis and Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni in Rome.  On the European trip, Zelensky said Ukraine will aim to liberate Russian-occupied areas within Ukraine’s internationally recognized borders, and not attack Russian territory.  The Washington Post cited previously undisclosed documents from a trove of US intelligence leaks suggesting that Zelensky has considered trying to capture areas in Russia proper for possible use as bargaining chips in peace negotiations to end the war launched by Moscow in February 2022. This would put him at odds with Western governments that have insisted that weapons they provide must not be used to attack targets in Russia.  Asked about the report, Zelensky said: “We don’t attack Russian territory, we liberate our own legitimate territory.”  “We have neither the time nor the strength (to attack Russia),” he said, according to an official interpreter. “And we also don’t have weapons to spare with which we could do this.”  “We are preparing a counterattack for the illegally occupied areas based on our constitutionally defined legitimate borders, which are recognized internationally,” Zelensky said.  Among areas still occupied by Russia are the Crimean peninsula and parts of eastern Ukraine with mainly Russian-speaking populations."

Awami League lawmaker Naheed on Wednesday filed the case against former army chief and former president Ziaur Rahman, retired Lieutenant Colonel Abu Taher, and 25 others, accusing them of taking part in the killings of her father Colonel Khandker Nazmul Huda, Major General Khaled Mosharraf, and Lieutenant Colonel ATM Haider in Dhaka during a turmoil inside the army on November 7, 1975.  ‘Naheed Izahar Khan filed the case against Ziaur Rahman for her father’s murder for the benefit of the current fascist Awami League regime. There is a political conspiracy behind it. The main reason is to divert domestic and foreign democracy-lovers’ attention from the ongoing anti-fascist movement,’ BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir said at a press conference at the party chairperson’s Gulshan office in Dhaka.  Giving a formal reaction about the case filed 48 years after the killing of Colonel Nazmul Huda in an army mutiny on November 7, 1975, the BNP leader said that Ziaur Rahman rather ordered the protection of Nazmul Huda.  In a written statement, the BNP secretary general mentioned that it was an irony that Naheed Ezaher Khan probably did not even read the book authored by her mother. Her mother, Neelufar Huda, clearly writes in the book titled ‘Colonel Huda O Amar Juddha’, stating the situation in which Colonel Huda was killed.  ‘The testimony of the people present there proves that on that day Ziaur Rahman ordered Colonel Nawazish Ahmed to protect Khaled Mosharraf, Colonel Huda, and Major Haider. On page 134 of the book written by the mother of the plaintiff, Naheed Ezaher Khan, Colonel Taher’s involvement in the murder has clearly emerged,’ Fakhrul said.  Mentioning that Colonel Huda was the brigade commander in Rangpur Cantonment in 1975, Fakhrul said that Colonel Huda was one of the participants in the military coup led by Khaled Mosharraf on November 3, 1975.  ‘He [Colonel Huda] came to Dhaka to lead the coup. It should be noted that the then army chief, Major General Ziaur Rahman, was put under house arrest to seize state power under Khaled Mosharraf. Basically, Khaled Mosharraf and his associates’ political ambitions led to the most brutal prison killings in history,’ he added.  Fakhrul said that the Khaled Mosharraf-led coup created an extremely chaotic environment in the army.  ‘By taking the opportunity, the Revolutionary Soldier Organization and Jasad Gono Bahini, led by Colonel Taher-Inu [Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal president Hasanul Haq Inu], staged a counter-coup, creating an army officer-soldier dispute in the army and participating in a far-reaching domestic-foreign plot to kill brutal army officers. Colonel Nazmul Huda, one of the participants in the Khaled Mosharraf-led coup, is a cruel victim,’ he said."

Now we know what he means.  If Labour wins next year, Starmer plans to rig future elections by giving the vote to millions of EU nationals, plus millions more 16 and 17-year-olds.  The plan would mean that 3.4million EU citizens with 'settled status' would be eligible to vote. Another 2.6million are 'pre-settled' and would doubtless be fast-tracked by Labour.  At a stroke, the electorate would be packed with some 6million foreign voters: More than enough to swing any general election – or a new EU referendum.  Enfranchising under-18s would add another 1.4million voters to the electoral roll.  © Provided by Daily Mail If Labour wins next year, Keir Starmer (pictured) plans to rig future elections by giving the vote to millions of EU nationals, plus millions more 16 and 17-year-olds  The audacity of this expansion of the franchise – the biggest for nearly a century since 1928, when most women got the vote – is exceeded only by its cynicism.  For Sir Keir knows, of course, that the great majority of these extra votes would go to him.  Handing the right to vote to foreigners and mid-teens would tilt the delicate balance of British politics permanently in Labour's favour. We know that Sir Keir would dearly love to reverse Brexit. Several million extra votes would enable him to pull off just such a coup within a few years of taking power.  Labour's plan would also be a giant step towards a one-party state. Many on the Left have looked enviously north of the border, as the SNP lowered the Scottish Parliament's voting age to 16 and extended it to EU citizens too.  Nicola Sturgeon, the former first minister, may now be disgraced and discredited, but – when it comes to her electoral initiatives – Labour is following her example.  Sir Keir's electoral stitch-up is so transparently self-interested that it amounts to political chicanery – 'dirty and nasty' indeed.  Yet the fact that it fails the smell test doesn't mean it could not happen. Most people will instinctively know that Labour's plan is wrong. But why?  Giving votes in general elections to EU residents would be a bad idea even if it were reciprocal. But it is not. Last year the European Court of Justice ruled that UK citizens living in France cannot vote even in local elections, let alone national ones.  © Provided by Daily Mail Labour's plan would also be a giant step towards a one-party state. Pictured: Starmer at a pro-EU rally in 2019  That ruling applies to all other EU countries apart from Ireland because it has a century-old reciprocal agreement on voting with Britain.  Why should the UK give votes to EU nationals who live and work here, when Brussels refuses to do the same for British expats in Europe?  A more fundamental reason for rejecting Labour's plan is that voting is the most basic of democratic rights, which ought to be granted only to British citizens with a permanent stake in the future of this country. My Polish daughter-in-law gained UK citizenship, not just by living here for a decade and mastering English, but by demonstrating her knowledge of and commitment to Britain, by – among other things – making a solemn oath of allegiance to the Crown.  To give the vote to foreigners who have done none of this, but merely have 'settled status', is to devalue the very idea of citizenship.  We all loathe the idea of 'health tourists' – visitors who come here only to take advantage of the NHS. So why create 'voting tourists'? As for giving the vote to 16 and 17-year-olds, this preposterous proposal ignores the fact that they are still adolescents and considered insufficiently mature to enjoy many of the rights and freedoms that over-18s enjoy.  We don't allow under-18s to gamble, to buy alcohol or tobacco, or even to have a credit card. In England and Wales, it is not possible to get married until the age of 18.  These and many other legal prohibitions exist because, in law, 16 and 17-year-olds are not adults but children, who need protection and cannot be held fully responsible for their actions.  That is why courts are much more lenient in sentencing minors. By the same token, however, under-18s should not expect to enjoy the same rights as adults. That includes the right to vote.  By dangling this precious right in front of youngsters who cannot yet properly grasp its significance, Sir Keir shows that he cares nothing for their welfare but everything for his own party political interest.  Lowering the voting age is a policy he has inherited from Jeremy Corbyn – the most dangerous man ever to lead a major party in Britain.  And let it never be forgotten that Sir Keir campaigned to put Corbyn into No 10.  It is chilling to imagine the consequences of giving the vote to EU citizens and children. The temptation to promise them favours at the expense of others would be overwhelming.  It's easy to imagine Left-wing politicians lifting border controls to please EU voters. Or wooing teenagers with a bonfire of age restrictions on alcohol, cigarettes, betting and nightclubs.  Britons are rightly proud of having exported liberty under the law to the whole world. But if Labour's rigged the electoral system, it would be a sinister kind of euthanasia for the oldest parliamentary democracy on Earth.  'Dirty and nasty'? The words are yours, Sir Keir."
