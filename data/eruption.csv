This is particularly true in the case of Iran, which continues to pressure Baku through various means.  The Second Karabakh War (September 27th – November 10th, 2020), known also as the 44-day War, changed the geopolitical landscape of the South Caucasus. In this war with Armenia, Azerbaijan succeeded in liberating its territories that had been occupied for up to three decades. The international community, including Iran, recognised Azerbaijan’s right to retake these territories, as a number of international documents and four resolutions from the United Nations Security Council clearly recognised the area as part of the Republic of Azerbaijan.  This war brought new dynamics to Iran’s policies with respect to the South Caucasus, the region that borders the Islamic Republic to the north.  The 44-day War and its outcomes were the first major signal of the erosion of Russian hegemony in the post-Soviet South Caucasus. Russia was previously seen by many as the major guarantor of the pre-war status-quo between Armenia and Azerbaijan, and as the force that averted the eruption of a large war between the two sides.  Azerbaijan’s resurgence in 2020 in the face of Russia’s failure to protect the status quo was at odds with Iran’s traditional vision of its northern neighbourhood.  Tehran had been used to treating the countries of the South Caucasus without any independent agency, as part of Russia’s sphere of influence in accordance with the outcomes of the wars between the Russian Empire and Persia in the early 19th century.  Russia was also seen in Tehran as a bulwark against the incursion of other external actors in the South Caucasus. This situation has also changed with the deployment of Turkey’s monitoring mission in Karabakh and Azerbaijan’s growing defence ties with Israel in the aftermath of the 2020 war.  The change in the regional balance of power caused a number of new concerns and exacerbated older ones in the Iranian capital.  The 2020 war, which turned out to be a big step towards the settlement of the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, alarmed Iranian leaders. They feared that Azerbaijan was on the path to overcoming the geopolitical redlines of Russia. An assertive Azerbaijan that is in an alliance with Turkey and Israel is unacceptable to Iran.  The Iranian media and many high-ranking officials openly describe Azerbaijan as a vassal state of Israel. One such article appeared in a media outlet close to the government of Iran, calling Azerbaijan “Yahudistan” (a Jewish state) and voicing a list of threats and warnings against Baku.  Along with geopolitical risks, Tehran is also concerned about the implications of Azerbaijan’s more assertive position on Iran’s domestic politics. There are up to over 20 million ethnic Azerbaijanis living in its territories, with most concentrated in the northern part of Iran. This was the area that came under Iranian control after the aforementioned wars with Russia in the early 1800s. It is still viewed as “South Azerbaijan” by Azerbaijanis. The occasional calls from some western countries and Israel for greater support for the independence aspirations of the Azerbaijani provinces of Iran further agitates the country.  In order to counter these developments, the Islamic Republic has taken a list of measures.  These measures include practicing for a military confrontation with Azerbaijan, building an alliance with Armenia, and countering Azerbaijan’s efforts to optimise the country’s connectivity projects.  In this context, Iranian leaders question Azerbaijan’s independence and its ethnic identity, claiming that Azerbaijan was a historical part of Iran and should return to Iranian control. One of the latest claims was made by Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Ali Fadavi, who reiterated these historical claims against Azerbaijan. He said that this country was separated from Iran due to the incompetence of the Qajar kings.  Attempting to take advantage of the many Shiite believers in Azerbaijan, he openly called for a change of government in Baku. He stated that “The people of Azerbaijan are Shiite believers who did not lose their original Shiite beliefs under the 70 years of communist pressure. As a rule, there should be a government that pays special attention to this Shiite majority of Azerbaijan.”  These verbal attacks against Azerbaijan are disseminated by Iranian experts in both national and international media. For instance, Fardin Eftekhari, an Iranian researcher, mirroring the vision of the Iranian government, claims that Azerbaijan is no longer focused on only restoring its territorial integrity but rather envisions changes in regional interstate borders. He ultimately claims that Baku is preparing for the invasion of Armenia.  Thus, Iran views Armenia as an ally and seeks to combine forces with this country against Azerbaijan and its allies Turkey and Israel.  In late 2022, Azerbaijani media reported that 14 people from Iran entered the Karabakh region of Azerbaijan through the Lachin road “to conduct sabotage and terrorist exercises for armed Armenian gangs who are still present in the Azerbaijani territories temporarily monitored by the Russian peacekeepers”. There are also reports about Iran’s free of charge military supplies to Armenia, as well as its transfer of combat drones to Yerevan.  It is reported that Iran has been amassing its troops near the border with Azerbaijan, and high-ranking officials, including the commanders of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps Ground Forces and Border Troops visited the area. It is worth noting that Iran has conducted at least two military exercises along its interstate border with Azerbaijan since the 2020 Karabakh War, while it had never held similar exercises in this region before this conflict.  Tehran masks its concerns with false-flag allegations.  One major issue that Tehran refers to in this context is related to a possible change in interstate borders due to connectivity projects like the Zangezur corridor. This corridor, proposed in the Armenia-Azerbaijan-Russia deal following the 44-day War, is supposed to serve as a land passage for connecting mainland Azerbaijan with its Nakhchivan exclave via southern Armenia. Iran has warned against this project, claiming that it may cut off its geographical connection with Armenia.  Iran continues these accusations despite assurances from the Russian and Azerbaijani governments. For example, the Russian side has declared repeatedly that no extraterritoriality will be applied to the transportation routes that are planned to be opened between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Thus, both countries are expected to retain their sovereignty over the routes that pass through their respective territory. In another assurance, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev stated on October 14th that his country “had no intention of occupying the territory of Armenia, as some may assume.”  Nevertheless, Iran is exacerbating tensions in the region by asserting false-flag allegations against Azerbaijan. These tensions were reflected over the past few months in the lethal attack against the Azerbaijani embassy in Tehran (January 2023), a non-stop flight by an Iranian military aircraft along the Azerbaijan-Iran state border (March 2023), an assassination attempt against an Azerbaijani parliamentarian critical of Iran (March 2023), and the crackdown in Azerbaijan on Iran’s spy network.  These developments raise concerns in the region that there may be a military confrontation between the two sides, which would cause catastrophic outcomes for regional peace and stability.

Advertising Read more  However MFP leader Pita Limjaroenrat's determination to modify the lese-majeste laws protecting King Maha Vajiralongkorn has quickly emerged as a key issue that could block his path to power.  The monarchy has long had an exalted status in Thai society, and is shielded from criticism by section 112 of the penal code, which punishes infractions with jail terms of up to 15 years.  Posters of the king are ubiquitous, from shops and homes to public buildings and motorway billboards, and cinema-goers are expected to stand for the royal anthem before screenings.  But youth-led pro-democracy demonstrators in 2020 breached the taboo against public discussion of the monarchy's status, with some protesters calling for the king's power and spending to be reined in.  MFP channelled the reforming zeal of the protest movement in its campaign for Sunday's election, pledging to limit who can bring lese-majeste charges and to cut the maximum sentence.  - Tough laws -  Critics say the law is abused to silence political dissent, and prosecutions rocketed in the years after the 2014 coup that brought Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha to power.  Section 112 outlaws defaming, insulting or threatening the king or certain members of his family.  But its interpretation has expanded to include almost any criticism, whether in public or on social media, including even indirect or lighthearted references.  Since the 2020 protests erupted more than 200 people have been prosecuted, including minors, some for seemingly trivial transgressions.  Earlier this year a man was jailed for two years for selling satirical calendars featuring yellow rubber ducks that a court ruled insulted the king.  MFP proposes to cut the maximum sentence for lese-majeste and restrict who can bring charges -- at the moment it can be done by anyone, and ultra-royalists are known to trawl social media looking for potential complaints to file.  Pita insists the changes are needed to heal rifts in Thai society, and that Move Forward will not eradicate the law.  ""We want to amend, not abolish, act 112, which can be done in the parliament,"" he said.  ""We would like to talk maturely in the parliament, and we will do it slowly but surely and thoroughly.""  But in the past the army has used even the suggestion of disloyalty to the crown as grounds to launch a coup.  The generals ousted elected governments in 2006 and 2014, promising both times to get tough on elements threatening the monarchy.  And the current, military-written constitution makes it extremely difficult for Pita to become prime minister, even though Move Forward won the most seats.  MFP and rival opposition party Pheu Thai are working on a multi-party coalition that would give them more than 300 out of 500 lower house seats.  But to secure the prime minister's job the coalition needs a majority across both houses -- including the Senate.  The 250 members of the Senate -- monarchist, pro-military arch-conservatives, hand-picked by Prayut's junta -- are threatening to block Pita's bid for the job.  ""I disapprove despite the number of MPs he gathered,"" Senator Jadet Inswang said.  ""I will not accept Pita as a PM because he... has previously said that he would abolish 112. I can't accept.""  Cycle of unrest  But given the results of the election, the issue is now part of the political debate regardless of whether Pita becomes prime minister, according to Napon Jatusripitak, a political scientist and researcher at the Yusof Ishak Institute.  ""I think there is going to be some political space for amending the lese-majeste clause, regardless of whether the MFP ends up in the government or not,"" Napon told AFP.  ""This election has sort of been a quiet referendum on that issue.""  Rejecting a prime minister chosen by a coalition government with such a large electoral mandate could plunge the country into a fresh crisis, with protesters likely to flood the streets.  This would reignite the cycle of elections, street protests and coups that have dogged Thailand for two decades, fomenting instability and hampering progress.  And despite the challenges facing them, many MFP supporters feel the dam has already been broken.  ""This election was a slap in the face of the older generation, the old mindset, the old belief, and the old politics -- the status quo has been demolished,"" Panussaya Sitthijirawattanakul, a 2020 protest leader hit with multiple lese-majeste charges, told AFP.  © 2023 AFP"

The deteriorating situation in Sudan is also having dramatic implications on neighbouring countries, many of which are grappling with their own protracted crises.  Out of USD 209 million, IOM is urgently calling for USD 105 million needed for the response in Sudan and USD 104 million for the response across Egypt, Libya, Chad, Central African Republic, South Sudan and Ethiopia.  This appeal also covers the USD 37 million IOM needs to immediately assist third-country nationals stranded in Sudan and in neighbouring countries.  “The current humanitarian situation in Sudan is by far the worst the country has ever seen,"" said IOM Director General António Vitorino.  “Millions are in pressing need of basic assistance such as water, food and shelter. If we do not act NOW, the people of Sudan will face an inevitable humanitarian catastrophe. We appeal to the international community to urgently support relief efforts and mobilize financial resources to meet the mounting needs.""  The conflict is having devastating consequences for millions of civilians. Around 25.7 million people are now estimated to be in need of humanitarian assistance inside Sudan and across its borders. Over 843,130 people are internally displaced inside the country according to IOM’s Displacement Tracking Matrix, with 1.8 million more expected to be internally displaced should the fighting continue. Prior to the conflict, there were already 3.8 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) and 1.1 million refugees in Sudan.  Nearly 259,000 people have already fled Sudan into neighbouring countries, arriving in extremely vulnerable situations into often remote and underserved areas. If fighting continues, it is estimated that over a million refugees and migrants affected by the crisis in Sudan may cross to neighbouring countries.  Millions remain inside the country with soaring food and transportation prices, lack of cash and access to health care, supplies and critical services. The deteriorating situation has been marked by increasing civilian deaths, destruction of health, water and communication facilities, shortage of supplies and poor conditions at overwhelmed border points as people flee the fighting.  IOM is working with partners on an interagency and coordinated response plan and appeal, to enable the scale-up needed to respond to the rising needs of Sudanese and third-country nationals and returnees. IOM’s Crisis Response Plans for Sudan, Chad, Ethiopia, and the Central African Republic remain severely underfunded.

Meanwhile, 10 Manipur MLAs of the Chin-Kuki-Mizo-Zomi-Hmar communities have repeated their demand for a separate administration.  The latter fear that they could fall in the hands of militant groups like the PLA.  The Express report noted that “more than 1,000 weapons and 10,000 rounds were looted from Manipur Police Training College, two police stations, and an IRB battalion camp in Imphal by Meities during the first few days of the violence in Manipur.”  Kukis attacked and looted police stations in Churachandpur, sources told the paper.  These weapons, if not recovered soon, have the capacity to foment trouble.  Meanwhile, the Coordinating Committee on Manipur Integrity (COCOMI), a valley-based umbrella body of civil society groups, has notified police of anonymous calls it has been getting to get it to pressure the government to stop recovering weapons, the report said.  Former CRPF DG Kuldiep Singh, who is advising the Manipur government in the aftermath of the violence said 456 arms and 6,670 pieces of ammunition have so far been recovered. He added that recovered arms include those looted by Meitei and Kuki groups.  Yesterday, May 17, at the Supreme Court, Senior Advocate Colin Gonsalves, who was representing the Manipur Tribal Forum Delhi, told the bench that the Kuki community apprehended further violence against it. The Supreme Court urged the Manipur government to take appropriate action on such apprehensions.  MLAs repeat demand for separation  The Telegraph has reported that 10 Manipur MLAs, belonging to the Chin-Kuki-Mizo-Zomi-Hmar communities, in a memorandum to Union home minister Amit Shah have claimed their people have “lost faith” in the BJP-led state government and can “no longer” think about “resettling in the Valley” following the violence that erupted on May 3.  The MLAs have reiterated their demand for a separate administration in the hills, noting that they cannot “live together any more.” This is not the first time that such a request has been put forth. The MLAs, seven of whom are from the ruling BJP, including two ministers, had earlier released a statement with this demand.  They also noted that no Union minister has visited the state since the violence erupted."

The move signifies a fundamental shift - NATO had seen no need to draw up large-scale defence plans for decades, as it fought smaller wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and felt certain post-Soviet Russia no longer posed an existential threat.  But with Europe's bloodiest war since 1945 raging just beyond its borders in Ukraine, the alliance is now warning that it must have all planning in place well before a conflict with a peer adversary such as Moscow might erupt.  ""The fundamental difference between crisis management and collective defence is this: It is not we but our adversary who determines the timeline,"" said Admiral Rob Bauer, one of NATO's top military officials. ""We have to prepare for the fact that conflict can present itself at any time.""  By outlining what it calls its regional plans, NATO will also give nations guidance on how to upgrade their forces and logistics.  ""Allies will know exactly what forces and capabilities are needed, including where, what and how to deploy,"" said NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg about the highly classified documents that will, as in the Cold War, assign certain troops to the defence of certain regions.  This formalises a process triggered by Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, which prompted Western allies for the first time to deploy combat troops to the east, with Britain, Canada and Germany each taking the lead in one of the Baltic states.  NOT A COLD WAR RE-RUN  But while many features resemble NATO's military line-up before 1990, some crucial factors have changed for an alliance that has since then expanded some 1,000 km (600 miles) to the east and grown from around a dozen to 31 members.  Story continues  Finland's accession last month has alone doubled NATO's border with Russia to some 2,500 km, forcing a more flexible approach to deployments than in the past, when Germany was seen as the main battlezone.  Also, the alliance is no longer preparing to fight a large-scale nuclear war against Moscow and its allies - most of whom are now NATO members - said Ian Hope, historian at NATO's Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE).  ""We don't envision the type of war that the Cold War was, where allied forces ... would be hit simultaneous with large-scale Warsaw Pact attacks,"" he said, pointing rather to regionalised conflicts that needed to be contained by quick force deployments.  At the same time, the internet, drones, hypersonic weapons and a rapid flow of information present new challenges.  ""The good news is that we talk about the transparency of the battlefield. With all the satellites, with all the intel we're able to see a maturing crisis,"" said Lieutenant General Hubert Cottereau, SHAPE's Vice Chief of Staff. ""For Ukraine, we had all the indicators quite in advance.""  This transparency is one of the reasons why NATO, contrary to the Baltic states' demands, does not see any immediate need to ramp up troop numbers in the east.  ""The more troops you are massing up on the border, it's like having a hammer. At some point, you want to find a nail,"" warned Cottereau. ""If the Russians are massing troops on the border that will make us nervous, if we are massing troops on the border that will make them nervous.""  CHALLENGES  Still, it will be a huge task to drastically improve readiness. NATO agreed in 2022 to put 300,000 troops on high alert, up from 40,000 in the past.  Shortcomings in the alliance's capacity to produce sufficient weapons and ammunition have been highlighted by the struggle to keep pace with Ukraine's demands, and NATO must also upgrade the long-neglected logistics needed to quickly deploy troops via rail or road.  The need to finance the implementation of the regional plans is one of the reasons why Stoltenberg has called upon leaders to raise the alliance's military spending target, another topic that will be discussed in Vilnius.  NATO officials estimate it will take a few years for the plans to be fully implemented, though they stress that the alliance can head into battle immediately if required.

In that sense, the hearing didn’t disappoint. Though, by the hearing’s end, Republicans found themselves upstaged by a superior performer with better material.  Conservative lawmakers have been portraying the District of Columbia as a crime-riddled hellscape in need of federal intervention. That thinking was the impetus behind a Republican-backed bill that President Joe Biden signed in March that overturned revisions to the district’s criminal code. The move marked the first time in more than 30 years that federal lawmakers had overturned district legislation, and it reflected conservatives’ insatiable appetite for illiberal power grabs targeting nonwhite voters and officials.  Tuesday’s hearing came during yet another power grab. Last month, House Republicans passed legislation rescinding police reforms backed by the district’s largely Black city council in 2020, as protests erupted nationwide over police brutality. The Republicans in the Senate — with the help of some conservative-leaning independents and Democrats — passed the measure Tuesday, though Biden has said he will veto it.  House Republicans seemed dead set on using the hearing to launch rhetorical grenades. And Democrats at the hearing sent them back with the velocity of a tennis serve.  A freshman Republican lawmaker, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida, probably got the worst of it. In the clip below, watch how Luna alludes to the scariness of D.C. by claiming it has seen a spike in sexual assaults, but then doesn’t let the witness respond.  Another freshman, Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, used some of her time to offer a rebuttal, noting she was excited to hear Luna’s comments “considering that the [Republican] front-runner right now for, like, [the] presidency has kind of just been found liable of sexual abuse.”  Crockett was clearly referring to last week’s finding by a civil jury in New York that former President Donald Trump was liable for sexually abusing and defaming writer E. Jean Carroll.  I can’t imagine Luna knew, in delivering her remarks, that she was lobbing an alley-oop for Crockett to dunk on her head. But that’s precisely what happened.  And Crockett continued to run up the score. In another viral clip, she again highlighted Republicans’ hypocrisy on crime.  “My Republican colleagues want to talk about keeping D.C. streets crime-free. They can’t even keep the halls of Congress crime-free,” Crockett said, adding that “my freshman colleague has just been indicted on 13 counts — 13 felony counts, right?”  Here, Crockett was clearly talking about Rep. George Santos, R-N.Y., who was arrested last week and charged with wire fraud, money laundering, theft of public funds and making materially false statements to the House of Representatives. Santos denies all the allegations against him, but legislation has been proposed to expel him from Congress.  Crockett had a simple explainer for her rhetorical approach here. Sharing one of the above clips on Twitter, she added: “I just call them as I see them.”  This should be required viewing for Democrats pondering ways to punch back at Republicans who use conspiratorial hearings to misinform and manipulate the public — especially when it comes to crime."

After Mark Vientos and Francisco Alvarez each provided their own game-tying home run to force extra innings, Alonso launched a no-doubt three-run home run in the bottom of the 10th inning to lift the Mets to their first walk-off win of the season, 8-7, over the Rays on Wednesday night at Citi Field.  The downtrodden Citi Field crowd, resigned to the Mets’ sixth series loss in their last seven, finally received their chance to erupt. The biggest win of the season for the Mets (21-23) erased some frustration and gave them an opportunity to grab a momentum-shifting series win over the best team in baseball on Thursday.  ""I'm really fortunate because without them coming through in those big spots, I'm not given that opportunity,"" said Alonso, who provided the heroics and his league-leading 15th home run in the midst of a sinus infection. ""Our young guys are pros. They put together great at-bats consistently, and I'm really thankful for them coming up clutch because I wouldn't have that opportunity to help the team in extras there.""  It was Brett Baty's long ball that snapped a 56-inning homerless streak on Tuesday night. On Wednesday, a trio of home runs, including two by the youngest members of the team, proved just how quickly a few swings of the bat can flip the mood.  ""Everybody's making their path easier. We'll see. They have that background to be able to do that,"" Buck Showalter said. ""We'll see if they can do it at this level.  ""On the other side of that, I don't want them to put this to some apex level that's unattainable. They can do it. They just have to be consistent.""  Tiebreakers: Mark Vientos and Francisco Alvarez  With the Mets offense seemingly stuck in the mud through a scoreless first six innings, Vientos first lifted the Mets up with a two-run shot that crawled over the center-field wall.  The big blast, which he said he pleaded with to clear the wall, off Ryan Thompson came on the same day he was called back up to the major leagues.  ""It feels really good to get the first one out of the way. First hit, first home run,"" Vientos said. ""Now just go out there and play and have fun.""  But the energy provided by Vientos was short-lived. In the very next inning, Brandon Lowe put the Rays back ahead a two-run home run off Adam Ottavino. And Randy Arozarena tacked on another off Stephen Nogosek on an RBI single.  It would be up to the kids one more time in the bottom of the ninth inning after Daniel Vogelbach drew a leadoff walk and Starling Marte was hit by a pitch. Brett Baty came on as a pinch-hitter and struck out and Vientos flied out to center field.  With the Mets down to their final out and trailing by three runs, Alvarez clobbered a sweeper off the front of the second deck in left field to tie the game. In the process, he hoisted his bat in the air for the most lively bat flip of the season.  ""It made me remember a lot of the moments where I didn't have success, like the at-bat against (Josh) Hader, which was a terrible at-bat,"" Alvarez said. "" I said, 'If he's going to throw me slider, slider or not, if it's a strike, I'm going to swing at it. If it's not a good pitch, I won't swing at it. It made me remember all of those moments I had in previous at-bats.""  Alvarez, Baty and Vientos have combined for less than a major league season's worth of experience, but the Mets' rookies have made an instant impact, much to the delight of their teammates and coaches. It set the stage for Alonso to do what he does best in the bottom of the ninth.  Kodai Senga rises to the moment  Kodai Senga said the ending felt like something out of a movie.  But it would not have happened without the sublime effort of the Japanese rookie, who was pitching in front of his parents, sister and her fiancé for the first time in the United States. He joked that he was glad he didn't get booed.  Instead, he received a standing ovation as he came through with a career-high 12 strikeouts over six innings with one earned run allowed on three hits and three walks.  ""I knew that they were a really good team going into it, given their record obviously,"" Senga said. ""And I know we've been on a bit of a cold streak recently and I didn't pitch great last time, so I did whatever I needed to do to prepare for this game. I think it worked out well.""  After giving up a season-high five earned runs in his previous start, Senga looked as sharp as he has all season. He dialed his fastball up to 98 mph and produced seven swings and misses, including four strikeouts, with his ghost forkball. He threw a season-high 104 pitches, including an identical number of cutters and forkballs.  With his third quality start in eight outings, Senga lowered his ERA to 3.77.  ""I think soon it's going to be like a cat-and-mouse game where are they going to look for the fastball or are they going to look for the splitter?"" Senga said. ""I need to make sure to make the right decision with what they're looking for and throwing what they're not looking for.""  ."

Township Trustee Tom Weidman asked the court to modify the statute of limitations so he can pursue a defamation claim against real estate developer Chris Hildebrant.  The case involves a fake email that Hildebrant admitted creating in 2011 but Weidman says he didn’t know about until 2020. When Weidman sued for defamation in 2021, a trial judge ruled the one-year statute of limitations started in 2011 and dismissed the case.  In a 35-minute hearing, justices seemed open to Weidman’s proposed “discovery rule” to allow for later lawsuits when the alleged defamation is “secretive, concealed, or otherwise unknowable” to the person defamed.  “How can a plaintiff bring an action about something that they don’t know about?” Justice Michael Donnelly asked.  Justice Jennifer Brunner added: “What would stop someone from publishing something that was just patently false in a very closed setting among a small group of people, waiting for a year and then releasing it widely on the internet, they would be insulated from any liability, correct?”  Justices Pat DeWine and Joe Deters recused themselves from the case. They were replaced on the panel by two appellate court judges. Weidman is a longtime GOP fundraiser in Hamilton County, where Deters served as prosecutor and DeWine, as county commissioner.  The case flowed from a controversy that erupted in 2021, when Hildebrant accused Weidman of soliciting bribes for proposed Kenwood land deals from 2009 to 2011. Hildebrant offered an email as evidence of the alleged bribes, but later admitted he wrote the email to himself before showing it to a colleague in December 2011. When Hildebrant showed it to Sycamore Township officials in early 2020, they requested a state investigation. Weidman learned about the fake email from state investigators.  A Warren County judge dismissed Weidman’s defamation claim, saying it should have been filed within one year of the email’s first use in 2011. The 12th District Court of Appeals disagreed.  “Given the secretive manner in which Hildebrant went about publishing the defamatory remarks, Weidman could not have known about the libelous conduct and the injury resulting therefrom until November 18, 2020 – the date he met with investigators from the Auditor's Office,” said the May 2022 ruling.  The Ohio Supreme Court agreed to review the case in July 2022. During Tuesday’s hearing, Weidman sat behind the podium where attorney Todd McMurtry argued on his behalf. McMurtry said 10 state supreme courts have modified libel rules to account for changes in technology and other factors.  “Secretive publications are probably more problematic today, with the ability to create a fake email account, disguise yourself as somebody else, send that email,” McMurtry said. “I think the court, in a very limited way, is just having to adjust to the modern realities of publications that are secretive, concealed or otherwise unknowable.”  Hildebrant’s attorney, Chad Ziepfel, argued Weidman’s proposed solution is unworkable and unnecessary in Ohio.  “The General Assembly has obviously known for 130 years that the discovery rule doesn’t apply to defamation in Ohio,” Ziepfel said. “And if it were a real problem, we would expect the General Assembly to remedy that. That’s a policy issue that should be left to the legislature.”  Justice Melody Stewart took issue with Ziepfel’s argument that Weidman’s proposed standard is unworkable.  “If the plaintiff never discovers it, the claim never exists,” Stewart said. “If he gets wind of it, gets notice, it’s discovered, you have a year to bring a claim. If you don’t you lose it.”  Justice Pat Fischer questioned whether attorneys could find ways to exploit the language suggested by McMurtry.  “I’m OK with the words secret and concealed. I’m talking about the phrase ‘otherwise unknowable.’ It just seems like a nebulous term to me,” Fischer said."

Biren Singh had made “provocative and targeted” statements in the past.  “Please advise your constitutional authorities that statements should be made with a great sense of responsibility,” Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud addressed Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for Manipur.  Advocate Nizam Pasha, representing the Zomi Students’ Federation in an interim application, referred to a recent judgment in which the court had asked “public functionaries and other persons of influence and celebrities” to be aware of the impact their public statements may have on people.  Priority to restore calm  “Some exercise of restraint should be there,” Chief Justice Chandrachud observed. Mr. Mehta agreed with the court and said that the State’s first priority was to “restore calm”.  However, he backed an apprehension voiced by senior advocate Ranjit Kumar, for the High Court Bar Association of Manipur, about illegal migrants entering the State from Myanmar through a “porous border”. Mr. Mehta added, “This is a concern for the State also.”  The Solicitor General, as soon as the hearing began, said that the situation in the State had “improved a lot”. He said that the State was “peaceful and quiet”.  Seeking Army deployment  Senior advocate Colin Gonsalves, representing the Manipur Tribal Forum Delhi, said that he was “surprised” by the statement. He noted that the status report submitted by the State did not have “a word about the killings that happened after the last hearing” in the Supreme Court on May 8.  “That is because our intentions are different. My intention is to restore calm and peace, and not to aggravate… Politics can wait. Let peace and tranquility be our priority,” Mr. Mehta countered.  The court asked authorities to examine an interim application filed by Mr. Gonsalves for a direction to the Centre to “immediately” deploy the Army in villages where attacks were “likely to happen imminently”. The Bench ordered that the Manipur Chief Secretary and Security Advisor each be provided with a copy of the application.  In Focus podcast | What is behind the eruption of communal violence in Manipur?  Mr. Mehta, referring to a status report, said that 318 relief camps had been opened and 47,914 people provided relief through them. He said that security measures were put in place to protect life, property and religious places, adding that 46,298 stranded people have been helped.  Deferred implementation  Moreover, Mr. Mehta said that the State had successfully moved the High Court to defer by a year the implementation of its March 27 order. The High Court’s single judge Bench of Acting Chief Justice M.V. Muralidharan had, on March 27, directed the State government to “consider the case of the petitioners for inclusion of the Meetei/Meitei community in the Scheduled Tribe list, expeditiously, preferably within a period four weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order”.  “We gave time for Justice Muralidharan to correct himself and he has not done so. Now we have to stay the March 27 order,” Chief Justice Chandrachud observed initially.  However, Mr. Mehta said that staying the March 27 order at this point of time may affect the situation on the ground.  ‘Did not seek stay’  “The State had made a conscious call to only seek extension of time and not seek a stay… We had an option to challenge the order and seek a stay. But considering the position on the ground — this is about one tribe which according to the High Court should be conferred with the ST status — we chose not to seek a stay and only ask for extension for one year so that the situation calms down,” the Solicitor General submitted.  The State further pointed out that an appeal against the March 27 order was coming up for hearing in early June.  Refusing to be made into a “political forum”, the court directed the Manipur government to file a fresh status report. “We do not want to get into areas of politics and policy. We are not stalling the Manipur High Court. But as a constitutional court, we like to be periodically apprised of what is going on,” the Bench said."

Khan shared a video on Twitter showing scenes from outside his house while he was addressing the nation. This development comes after Khan’s recent arrest by the anti-graft agency in a corruption case, which was followed by a court granting him bail. However, his arrest had led to widespread violent protests throughout the country, resulting in the unfortunate loss of at least eight lives.  Imminent Arrest of Imran Khan Sparks Tension and Protests  In a dramatic turn of events, former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan revealed that his house was surrounded by police, raising concerns about his imminent arrest. Khan, who had recently been taken into custody by the anti-graft agency in connection with a corruption case, was subsequently released on bail by a court. However, the situation took a tumultuous turn as the news of his potential arrest spread.  Violent Protests Erupt Across the Nation  The news of Imran Khan’s impending arrest triggered widespread protests across the country, with demonstrators expressing their anger and frustration. Unfortunately, these protests turned violent in some areas, leading to tragic consequences. At least eight individuals lost their lives amidst the chaos and clashes between protesters and law enforcement authorities. The scenes outside Khan’s house, captured in the video he shared on Twitter, portrayed the tense atmosphere prevailing in the nation.  The Need for Stability and Dialogue  The escalating tensions and violence in the aftermath of Imran Khan’s arrest highlight the urgent need for stability and dialogue in Pakistan. It is crucial for all parties involved to find peaceful and constructive ways to address their grievances and concerns. The country’s leaders must prioritize the well-being and safety of its citizens, ensuring that differences are resolved through peaceful means and in accordance with the rule of law.  Calls for Restraint and Respect for Democratic Values  During such challenging times, it is essential for all stakeholders to exercise restraint and uphold the principles of democracy. Respect for the rule of law, freedom of expression, and the right to peaceful assembly are fundamental to a functioning democratic society. It is incumbent upon the government and its institutions to ensure the protection of these values and safeguard the rights of all individuals, regardless of their political affiliations.  Seeking a Peaceful Resolution  To prevent further escalation of tensions and violence, it is imperative that a peaceful resolution be sought. Engaging in meaningful dialogue, fostering understanding, and addressing legitimate concerns can pave the way for reconciliation and progress. Both the government and the opposition should prioritize the interests of the nation and its people, working together to find common ground and build a brighter future."

Board of Education of Topeka decision which held that racially segregated public schools were inherently unequal, and therefore unconstitutional.  On this date:  In 1536, Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer declared the marriage of England's King Henry VIII to Anne Boleyn invalid after she failed to produce a male heir; Boleyn, already condemned for high treason, was executed two days later.  In 1940, the Nazis occupied Brussels, Belgium, during World War II.  In 1946, President Harry S. Truman seized control of the nation's railroads, delaying -- but not preventing -- a threatened strike by engineers and trainmen.  In 1973, a special committee convened by the U.S. Senate began its televised hearings into the Watergate scandal.  In 1980, rioting that claimed 18 lives erupted in Miami's Liberty City after an all-white jury in Tampa acquitted four former Miami police officers of fatally beating Black insurance executive Arthur McDuffie.  In 1987, 37 American sailors were killed when an Iraqi warplane attacked the U.S. Navy frigate Stark in the Persian Gulf. (Iraq apologized for the attack, calling it a mistake, and paid more than $27 million in compensation.)  In 1996, President Bill Clinton signed a measure requiring neighborhood notification when sex offenders move in. (""Megan's Law,"" as it's known, was named for Megan Kanka, a 7-year-old New Jersey girl who was raped and murdered in 1994.)  In 2004, Massachusetts became the first state to allow same-sex marriages.  In 2010, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that young people serving life prison terms should have ""a meaningful opportunity to obtain release"" provided they didn't kill their victims.  In 2015, a shootout erupted between bikers and police outside a restaurant in Waco, Texas, leaving nine of the bikers dead and 20 people injured.  In 2017, the Justice Department appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as a special counsel to oversee a federal investigation into potential coordination between Russia and the 2016 Donald Trump campaign.  In 2020, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo was tested for the coronavirus on live TV as he announced that all people in the state who were experiencing flu-like symptoms were eligible for tests.  Ten years ago: The ousted head of the Internal Revenue Service, Steven Miller, faced hours of intense grilling before Congress; both defiant and apologetic, Miller acknowledged agency mistakes in targeting tea party groups for special scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status, but insisted that agents broke no laws and that there was no effort to cover up their actions. Jorge Rafael Videla (HOHR'-hay rah-fay-EHL' vih-DEH'-lah), 87, the former dictator who took power in Argentina in a 1976 coup and led a military junta that killed thousands during a ""dirty war"" against alleged subversives, died in Buenos Aires while serving life in prison for crimes against humanity.  Five years ago: With six Democrats joining Republicans in voting to confirm her, Gina Haspel won Senate confirmation to become director of the CIA. The Miss America Organization announced that it would now have women in its three top leadership positions, after an email scandal in which male officials were caught making vulgar and insulting comments about past winners.

Kathy Hochul develop a comprehensive plan to handle the growing number of migrants and they want Democratic colleagues to take action on newly-introduced bills Republicans say would address the crisis.  More than 60,000 migrants — many escaping violence, persecution, and poverty in Central America and South America — have arrived in the Big Apple since last summer, with 40,000 currently under the care of New York City.  State Senate Minority Leader Robert Ortt blasted Democrats on Wednesday Zach Williams/NY Post  “There’s just no plan. There’s no planning there. They really don’t have a handle on what’s going on,” ” Assemblyman Ed Ra (R-Garden City) said at a Capitol press conference.  “And that makes it very difficult.  “[The] coordination is not there, where it needs to be from the federal government and at the state level.”  Some of the bills plugged by Republicans on Wednesday were introduced in response to controversies that erupted after Mayor Eric Adams unveiled plans to send a few hundred migrants to Rockland and Orange counties — a move blasted by local pols.  Two other Assembly bills would beef up oversight of $1 billion in migrant funding to the city approved in the state budget as well as require the state to screen and monitor migrants as they apply for political asylum.  Gov. Kathy Hochul traveled to Washington, DC on Wednesday to press federal officials to take more actions to alleviate the crisis. AP  “Now with Homeland Security Secretary [Alejandro] Mayorkas releasing migrants on their honor, with no court date or process in place, New York must take the necessary actions to register and track those who have crossed the border illegally to ensure our communities are protected and they do not fall through the cracks of our broken system,” Assemblyman Matt Slater (R-Yorktown) said of the bill he is sponsoring to require migrants register with the state Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance.  The GOP-backed bills appear unlikely to pass the state Senate and Assembly dominated by Democratic supermajorities ahead of the June 8 end of the 2023 legislative session.  New York City is pushing to send more migrants outside as space fills up in the five boroughs. Robert Miller  Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie (D-Bronx) and state Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins (D-Yonkers) have said the federal government is ultimately responsible for resolving the crisis.  “Obviously, there has to be more intervention. There has to be more interaction. There has to be more cooperation and more collaboration at the federal level,” Stewart-Cousins said Wednesday.  “All of us have to be able to work together to deal with this crisis, which again, is a crisis in many ways, and certainly, humanity is at the core of it.”  Many of the migrants are pursuing asylum after escaping poverty, persecution and violence in their native countries. Robert Miller  Hochul has called on the Biden administration to take emergency actions to help the state while pushing to loosen work rules for migrants, who have to wait at least 180 days.  “You can complain all you want about what happened at the border and how that ended up there. I’ve got to deal in the reality of managing the crisis,” Hochul told NY1 on Wednesday.  “So does Mayor Adams. So give us the resources. Give us the work authorization, help us out.  “And even in Republican counties in upstate New York and Long Island, they will embrace the opportunity to take these individuals who are here legally seeking asylum if they can work.”  She spent the day in Washington, DC to meet with Democratic members of the state congressional delegation as well as Mayorkas.  The Assembly GOP minority is pushing for four bills aimed at mitigating the growing migrant crisis. Zach Williams/NY Post  A Hochul spokesman did not provide comment on GOP criticism back at the state Capitol that Hochul lacks a comprehensive strategy to accommodate the migrants as fights erupt between New York City and counties outsides its boundaries.  “More of us are going to be dealing with hearing that people are being relocated into our parts of the state and our counties,” Ra, who sponsored the legislation to increase funding oversight, said.  “I think the governor definitely needs to be more involved and make sure that we have some of the things we’re talking about — that we have actual protocols and policies about how we’re going to handle this.”  Hochul has begged Biden to increase federal aid to New York as the number of migrants continues to grow. Gabriella Bass  Hochul told NY1 on Wednesday that New York City will likely need more than the roughly $1 billion included in the state budget approved weeks past an April 1 deadline.  She issued an executive order last week to loosen procurement rules and increase the involvement of the National Guard in helping New York City handle the migrants before begging Biden to step up the federal response in a Friday letter to him.  Ortt, the GOP Senate minority leader, knocked Hochul on Wednesday for not demanding Biden keep Title 42 in place – a pandemic rule that allowed quick deportations of people entering the US illegally — before it expired last week.  Migrants at the vacant Hungerford School arrived by an NYC transit bus on May 17, 2023. Steve White for New York Post  “For her to not make any plea about Title 42, to not ask the federal government publicly, or have a meeting in the White House [is bad,” he said.  “And if she did, if the president ignored her, that’s even worse in a lot of ways.”  But he said it would be fine by him if Albany Democrats decide they want to return later in the year to address the crisis, especially if the supermajorities do not address the GOP migrant bills before the last scheduled day of the 2023 session next month.  “We’ve been called back before. And if this really is a crisis, and we don’t get it done, then we should get called back. And if that’s what needs to happen, we’ll come back to pass legislation that protects our local communities, and deals with this crisis,” Ortt said."

NASA Goddard Space Flight Center/Chris Smith (KRBwyle)/Handout via REUTERS  Listen to this article Your browser does not support the audio element.  An Earth-sized planet orbiting a dim star in our galactic neighborhood is offering some of the best evidence to date of volcanism beyond our solar system, with observations suggesting a rugged and rocky world tormented by constant eruptions.  Subscribe now to get unlimited access to The Indian Express exclusive and premium stories.  Scientists said on Wednesday the planet, the third detected orbiting this particular star, is likely covered with volcanoes – similar to Jupiter’s moon Io, the most volcanically active body in our solar system. In our solar system, Earth and Venus are volcanically active, as are some of Jupiter’s moons.  The planet’s volcanism was not directly observed but rather inferred due to its significant gravitational interaction with the larger of the two other planets orbiting the dim star. The gravitational tug from the larger planet may squeeze and flex the newly identified one, heating up its interior and causing surface volcanic activity, similar to Io, the researchers said.  Planets beyond our solar system are called exoplanets.  “There is not yet any direct observational evidence of exoplanet volcanism, but this planet is a particularly likely candidate,” said University of Kansas astronomy professor Ian Crossfield, one of the authors of the research published in the journal Nature.  It is a planet that does not rotate – with one side perpetually in daylight and the other in darkness.  “On the dayside, it is too hot for liquid water, so it is likely very dry and hot – likely a desert. On the night side, there is possibly a large icy glacier,” said study co-author Björn Benneke, head of the astronomy group at the University of Montreal.  Also read | Isro to launch navigational satellite for its constellation in May end  “The most interesting region is near the terminator region where the day and nightside meet. Here, water from the nightside glacier can melt and possibly form liquid surface water. In addition, there is likely volcanism all around the planet, even under the ice on the nightside and possibly under the water near the terminator,” Benneke said.  Advertisement  The planet is located in the Milky Way about 86 light-years away from our solar system in the direction of the constellation Crater. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).  It is slightly larger than Earth and orbits very close to a red dwarf star – a type much smaller than our sun, with relatively low mass and temperature – completing its elliptical journey around it in only 2.8 days.  Its surface temperature appears to be slightly warmer than Earth. It is situated on the inner edge of what is called the habitable zone, or Goldilocks zone, around the star – not too hot and not too cold, perhaps able to maintain liquid water on the surface and harbor life.  Advertisement  “I imagine a rugged, young surface for the planet after many millions of years of constant volcanic activity. Since the gravitational effects don’t care about day and night side, I also suspect the volcanic activity to be evenly spread over the planetary surface,” said University of California, Riverside planetary astrophysicist and study co-author Stephen Kane.  “Since the planet is so volcanically active, it is still contributing gases to the atmosphere from the interior. As such, the planet probably still has an atmosphere. The planet is unlikely to be habitable, however, since the total amount of energy makes for a quite hostile environment. Who knows? Life may find a way,” Kane added.

The researchers spotted the planet using NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and the now-retired Spitzer Space Telescope, as well as some ground-based observatories.  “There are still many unknowns regarding volcanism and how long a planet can maintain outgassing processes,” Kane said, referring to the release of trapped gas that occurs with eruptions. “We only recently confirmed that Venus, Earth’s twin planet, is volcanically active.”"

A newly released report from ﻿the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), the United Nations' weather and climate body, says there is a 98 per cent chance that Earth will set a new record for the hottest year in recorded history by 2027.  The report goes on to state that, in the same period, there is a 66 per cent chance that global surface temperatures will temporarily exceed 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels for at least one year.  Earth is expected to set a new hottest year on record in the next half-decade. (Getty)  That 1.5-degree increase is a long-feared mark that was listed as a target that global warming must be limited to under the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement.  While a temporary breach of the mark doesn't mean the world will have failed to meet the target, the WMO said it is sounding the alarm that it will be breached more and more frequently.  The release of greenhouse gases by burning fossil fuels, and the increasing likelihood of an El Niño developing this year, are the driving factors behind the temperature increases.  ""A warming El Niño is expected to develop in the coming months and this will combine with human-induced climate change to push global temperatures into uncharted territory,"" WMO Secretary-General Professor Petteri Taalas said.  ""This will have far-reaching repercussions for health, food security, water management and the environment.  ""We need to be prepared.""  READ MORE: Family has renewed hope after cold case reward increase ﻿  A repeat of the devastating 2019-20 bushfires could be caused by the impending record temperatures. (AP)  Dr Hamish Clarke, a research fellow in future fire risk at the University of Melbourne, said the report painted a bleak picture of future Australian bushfire seasons and droughts.  ""When it comes to bushfire risk, the news that there is a 98 per cent chance of setting a new global temperature record in the next five years is extremely worrying,"" he said.  ""High temperatures are one of the key ingredients for dangerous fire weather, along with dry and windy conditions.  ""As temperatures continue to rise, there is more chance of them coinciding with extended dry spells and droughts.""  Experts have said droughts are likely to occur as a result of increasing temperatures. (Louise Kennerly )  Other experts speaking about the report also expressed their concern about the likelihood of drought, while Monash University's Dr Kimberley Reid said it flagged particularly dire news for one of Australia's most iconic natural wonders.  ""In order for one of the next five years to not be record-breaking, we would either need no El Niño events in the next five years, or a massive volcanic eruption in the tropics, à la Krakatoa in 1883,"" Reid said.  ""Both are extremely unlikely scenarios.  ""My biggest fear is that we become desensitised to the ever-falling records and forget what these numbers actually mean.  ""1.5 degrees warming means the Great Barrier Reef probably won't survive this century. That's tragic.""  The Great Barrier Reef is in serious danger thanks to climate change. (Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority)  Clarke, meanwhile, said the report highlighted the need for more urgent action to reduce emissions and limit the extent of climate change.﻿  ""If we continue on our current path there is a real possibility of a repeat – or worse – of the conditions that led to the devastating Black Summer fires of 2019-20,"" he said.

The comments by Hamas added to the already heightened tensions ahead of Thursday’s march and threatened to reignite fighting between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza, just days after a cease-fire took hold. Two years ago, an 11-day war between Israel and Hamas erupted during the annual march.  While Hamas stayed out of the latest round of fighting, officials with the ruling Islamic militant group urged Palestinians to oppose Thursday’s parade.  “We ask the people of Jerusalem to mobilize the masses to confront the march of the flags in Jerusalem tomorrow,” said Mushir al-Masri, a Hamas official in Gaza.  Hamas also urged Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and inside Israel to “clash with the occupation"" and said it would hold a demonstration with Palestinian flags along Gaza’s heavily fortified frontier with Israel.  The parade is meant to mark “Jerusalem Day,” Israel's annual celebration of its capture of east Jerusalem, including the Old City and its holy sites, in the 1967 Mideast war.  Israel considers the entire city to be its eternal capital. But the international community does not recognize Israel's annexation of east Jerusalem, and the Palestinians claim the area as the capital of a future state.  In a speech marking Jerusalem Day, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel has broken “new horizons” since capturing east Jerusalem.  “We are committed to safeguarding the security of Jerusalem, to ensuring its prosperity and to continuing its momentum,” he said. “We are also doing this against all of the threats around us.”  Each year, thousands of Israeli nationalists participate in the march, waving blue and white Israeli flags and singing songs as they walk through the Muslim Quarter and toward the Jewish Quarter and the Western Wall, the holiest site where Jews can pray.  Israelis describe the parade as a festive event. But in past years, it has been marred by anti-Arab racist chants and violence toward local Palestinians by some of the marchers.  Adding to the combustible atmosphere, large numbers of Jews are expected to visit Jerusalem’s most sensitive holy site early Thursday before the parade.  The hilltop compound is known to Jews as the Temple Mount, home to the biblical Jewish Temples, and is the holiest site in Judaism. Palestinians call it the Noble Sanctuary, and today it is home to the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the third-holiest site in Islam.  Under longstanding agreements, Jews are permitted to visit the compound but not pray there. But an increase in such visits in recent years, along with scenes of some Jews quietly praying, have raised concerns among Palestinians that Israel is trying to alter the status quo — a charge Israel denies.  The competing claims to the site lie at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and often spill over into violence.  Chief Supt Yoram Segal, a senior police official in Jerusalem, said police would deploy some 2,500 officers on Thursday to ensure the day passes without violence.  “We are going to deal harshly with anyone who tries to disturb the peace,” he told reporters.  The march comes less than a week after Israel and the Islamic Jihad militant group in Gaza reached a cease-fire that ended five days of heavy fighting.  Hamas, the de facto government in Gaza responsible for the plight of the territory’s 2.3 million people, stayed out of the fighting, while Israel avoided attacking the militant group.  Reham Owda, an independent Gaza-based analyst, said that neither side appears interested in resuming cross-border violence.  “No one is interested in fierce escalation,” she said, but she said the parade could trigger “limited, symbolic” firing of rockets that could in turn spark Israeli airstrikes in retaliation.  If violence erupts in Jerusalem, Hamas could jump into the fray, as it did two years ago.  “The resistance is ready to protect Al-Aqsa Mosque and prevent the Judaization of Jerusalem,” al-Masri said.  ___  Associated Press writer Josef Federman in Jerusalem contributed to this report."

""I feel blessed,"" Bobby Weaver said. ""It could have been so much worse were it not for the professionalism of the first responders.""  Shortly after 1 a.m. Wednesday, city police Patrolman Timothy Youse was passing the brew pub at 325 S. Centre St. when he heard a fire alarm, Fire Chief James E. Misstishin Sr. said.  ""He was able to get inside and put out the fire in a kitchen grille with an on-site extinguisher,"" the chief said. ""There was a lot of smoke but no major damage.""  The fire, which was extinguished in a minute or two, has been ruled accidental, the chief said. No one was on-site when the fire erupted.  Based on security camera footage, Weaver said the fire was confined to the grille area of the kitchen.  The kitchen closed at 9 p.m., Weaver said, but the pub remained open for several hours afterward.  ""I was just about to get into bed after a busy night when I got the worst phone call imaginable — one of your buildings is on fire,"" said Weaver, who opened the brew pub in the former YWCA building in 2021.  Black Rock remains temporarily closed pending inspections by city authorities and insurance adjusters, Weaver said.  It's possible the pub might reopen this weekend, he said, but the kitchen is likely to be closed for several weeks for replacement of the grille and cleanup.  Meantime, Black Rock will offer take-out service from Farlows Deli & Hoagies and Pressed Coffee & Books, businesses associated with the Weaver family.  All seven of the city's volunteer fire companies responded to the fire, Misstishin said. They were on-site for about an hour.  Weaver expressed appreciation to the first responders for their quick reaction and professionalism.  ""We feel so lucky,"" he said. ""We're really thankful for their response.""

Despite the loss, the Cruisers had reason to hold their heads high after a season that saw them go further than any Eatonville High School soccer team in the past 21 years.  The Cruisers' spirits were high going into the decisive playoff game, buoyed by a resounding 2-0 victory over the Raymond Seagulls earlier in the week. Playing in front of a raucous home crowd, the Cruisers delivered a performance that ignited the stands and had fans on their feet throughout the match.  The first goal of the game came from Victor Peña, who found the back of the net with an assist from Riley Rockey. The crowd erupted in deafening cheers as the Cruisers took an early lead, setting the stage for an intense battle.  As the second half got underway, Kevin Tomyn seized an opportunity and scored on a blocked penalty kick, putting the Cruisers ahead 2-0.  Despite their valiant efforts in their next game, the Cruisers were ultimately outmatched by a dominant Columbia-White Salmon side.

Reflecting on the season, head coach Clinton Tomyn expressed immense pride in his team's accomplishment.  ""As the coach, I could not be more proud of these boys,"" he said. ""This was the farthest the EHS soccer team has gone for 21 years, and it is a testament to their hard work, dedication and the unwavering support of our community.""

The opening of U.S. Embassy Nuku’alofa comes as the countries work together on issues ranging from economic development and maritime security to the climate crisis.  “This opening symbolizes the renewal of our relationship and underlines the strength of our commitment to our bilateral relations, to the people of Tonga, and to our partnerships in the Indo-Pacific region,” U.S. Department of State Spokesperson Matthew Miller said.  Shared values  The new embassy paves the way for greater engagement with Tonga, Miller added, including a larger U.S. diplomatic presence there.  “We look forward to being able to engage more fully with our friends in Tonga and the broader region!” Marie C. Damour, the U.S. ambassador to Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, Tonga and Tuvalu, said in a tweet.  During a May 10 opening ceremony, Antone Greubel, deputy chief of mission at U.S. Embassy Suva, Fiji, described the United States’ partnership as “rooted in shared values and close cooperation.”  Today we are pleased to announce the opening of our newest embassy, in Nuku’alofa, Tonga. We value our shared history with Tonga, a relationship that dates back to 1886. The new embassy is a symbol of our commitment to a shared future and to the people of Tonga. #USWithTonga pic.twitter.com/WklK1pFdev — Department of State (@StateDept) May 10, 2023  The embassy opened less than a year after Vice President Harris announced in July 2022 that the United States and Tonga had begun talks on U.S. interest in opening an embassy. In August, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman met with Tupou VI, King of Tonga, in Nuku’alofa to celebrate 50 years of bilateral relations.  In September 2022, the Biden administration launched the first U.S. Pacific Partnership Strategy (PDF, 279KB), outlining steps for greater U.S. engagement in the Pacific region. Since then, the U.S. has opened an embassy in the Solomon Islands, moved the U.S. Embassy in Papua New Guinea to a new facility in Port Moresby, and announced an intent to open an embassy in Vanuatu, subject to congressional notification.  The United States is also continuing discussions with Kiribati about opening a new embassy in Tarawa.  Long-standing ties  Cultural and historic ties between the U.S. and Tonga date back to the Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation signed October 2, 1886. Tonga has welcomed over 1,700 U.S. Peace Corps volunteers since 1967.  More than 50,000 Tongan Americans live in the United States. They are part of a diverse Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander community that brings vibrant contributions to U.S. culture.  Recent U.S.-Tonga collaboration has included the response to the January 2022 volcanic eruption off the coast of Tonga that triggered tsunami waves and destroyed homes and infrastructure. The U.S. provided $2.6 million in humanitarian assistance and deployed satellite communications and early warning equipment.  In September 2022, President Biden announced $810 million in expanded programs for Pacific Islands, including $130 million to address the consequences of climate change and to bolster early warning systems for extreme weather events.  “The United States is a proud Pacific nation and has an enduring commitment to the Pacific Islands,” Harris told the Pacific Island Forum in Washington in July 2022."

Four groups submitted final bids on May 15 and at least one reached US$1 billion. Two remaining groups boast major stars.  Hip hop icon Snoop Dogg is part of Hollywood producer Neko Sparks’s bid. Toronto superstar The Weeknd was folded in by Harlo Capital’s Jeffrey and Michael Kimel. Canadian actor Ryan Reynolds was in the mix until he and his partners, real estate moguls the Remington Group, pulled out at the last minute.  Most observers are mildly surprised that a small-market Canadian hockey club has captured global headlines but absolutely astonished that it could fetch a billion dollars.  We shouldn’t be surprised. Pro sports franchises are some of the hottest commodities on the market, with billionaires from tech and finance pouncing on almost every premier franchise that’s become available.  These are high-profile, scarce assets with escalating valuations that offer entry into a hyper-exclusive club. They also carry deep emotional and historical ties to local communities and fan bases distributed around the globe.  Benefits of ownership  But status, scarcity and emotion aren’t the only reasons sports ownership is suddenly so appealing. Over the last 25 years, franchises have transformed from live entertainment holdings serving local populations to global, financialized assets.  They provide avenues for forms of investment and financial engineering not traditionally the purview of pro sports. They are leveraged for real estate and land development and provide “creative” tax scenarios. They garner good will with local citizens and governments to the benefit of the owners’ other business interests. They provide robust transmedia brands and intellectual property that can be monetized elsewhere.  These speculative forms of valuing franchises have been historically overlooked, but they are at the centre of the Senators sale. The purchaser will acquire the team, its current arena and 70 acres of land in Kanata on which the Canadian Tire Centre rests.  They will also acquire the opportunity to negotiate exclusive development rights at LeBreton Flats, 7.5 acres of prime real estate on the edge of Ottawa’s downtown. The Sens were selected last year by the National Capital Commission as its preferred development bid for this parcel of Crown land, which has tantalized developers for two decades.  Hence the many real estate magnates figuring prominently in the Senators sale. Reports suggest Reynolds and Remington, when still involved, planned to build a downtown arena district while redeveloping the Kanata land.  Most other bids appear keen to follow a similar path.  THE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian Wyld  Potential rewards are massive  These projects are inherently speculative. Despite no binding agreements with the city or the National Capital Commission, the bet is they will lead to revenue, land and franchise value increases that will justify a billion-dollar investment.  Such projections are based on examples like Edmonton’s ICE District, which has rewarded Oilers owner Daryl Katz handsomely for his 2008 purchase of the team. Katz is co-developer of the district, where blocks of restaurants, bars, condos and transit infrastructure were built around Rogers Place arena.  It typifies a new norm of stadium development that sees developers and policymakers mobilize public speculation to garner support. They assert that these projects will catalyze further development and economic activity in areas that are deemed in need of “regeneration” — although whether they actually do is endlessly debated.  These lucrative development plays contribute to rising franchise values, but real estate is only part of the story. A second and relatively novel form of speculation is increasingly important: leveraging sports teams as “IP,” the buzzword now used to describe intellectual property.  After purchasing the Welsh football club Wrexham AFC in 2021, Reynolds and his partner Rob McElhenney produced a docu-series, Welcome to Wrexham, that has been a streaming smash. Reynolds integrated the club with his other business interests through ad campaigns and other brand “synergies” to lucrative results.  The actors have used their star power to push the Wrexham AFC into areas not usually available to lower-tier soccer clubs, such as EA Sports’ FIFA video game franchise and a high-profile partnership with TikTok. Given their success, it was not surprising to see Reynolds trying to break into a major North American sports league.  (Patrick McElhenney/FX via AP)  Betting on future outcomes  Sports and business pundits have been slow to consider these speculative modes of valuing franchises, but financial markets and fans have not. It’s no coincidence that the influx of investors from finance and tech has overlapped with the rise of sports gambling.  Betting apps like FanDuel and DraftKings break sporting events down into ever smaller units — derivatives — that fan-users can bet on at every moment of an event.  Wagering on outcomes in this way is inherently speculative, mirroring activities that structure most financial markets in 2023. Arbitrage and futures trading, derivative markets and speculative real estate plays are about leveraging and monetizing uncertainty. They are less about reacting to past events than gaming scenarios and betting on probabilities. They seek to project and engineer future outcomes.  We should therefore understand the Senators sale not just in terms of recent transformations in sports business, but as symptomatic of these broader trends in which every aspect of culture and economy bends toward financialization and speculation."

Minutes later, the text was deleted from his phone. He has not been heard from since.  Osman, 60, had been returning home after delivering some medication to his father in another part of Khartoum. It was only through contact with an RSF source that his family were able to confirm find out that their father was being interrogated. Two weeks on, they have heard nothing more.  Kamal Ali Osman, who has not been heard from since he told his family he was being stopped by the RSF in Khartoum two weeks ago.  “We were shocked and scared. Why did he delete the message? We think he was forced to delete it,” said Osman’s daughter, Israa Ali Osman, 22, who was away in Egypt with other family when the fighting erupted in Sudan on 15 April between the RSF and the national army.  The family are among many who have been posting pictures and contact information on social media over the past month, desperately searching for loved ones who have gone missing in the weeks since the conflict began. Many people disappeared after venturing out of their homes for food or medication.  Osman’s daughter said there was no reason for him to be held – her father has no military involvement.  A relative who went to search for Osman found his car parked in an area where the RSF keep their vehicles. His daughter says he recently had a heart operation and needs daily medicines.  “We are constantly worried about him and his health,” she said. “My younger brothers always ask about him and my mother is worried as she suffers from diabetes and high blood pressure. We haven’t eaten or slept well for two weeks.”  At least 190 people have gone missing since 15 April, according to the Missing Initiative, a volunteer organisation founded after the RSF attacked a peaceful sit-in demanding civilian rule in 2019, killing at least 120 people, with more going missing. Its work has never stopped, as people have continued to disappear, particularly after a military coup in 2021.  “It has never stopped because violence has never stopped. The city was never safe and the country as a whole was surrounded by forces everywhere, whether RSF or army. On every corner, every day, there is someone to disappear after each and every protest,” said Fadia Khalaf, co-founder of the initiative.  Some are detained or disappeared, and others reportedly killed with their families unable to recover their bodies.  The process starts with a report from families, then the group’s members use their contacts to investigate. It is a long process that can weigh heavily on those involved.  skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Global Dispatch Free newsletter Get a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development team Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It does make you depressed and eventually you just burn out and feel like you can’t do anything any more. It becomes very heavy – on your heart, on your brain,” Khalaf said.  “It feels heavier than before because it wasn’t on the same scale. This is a war. There is no country, there’s no government, there’s no police. They’re bombing everywhere – hospitals, factories, houses, mosques. You feel lost. I’m not talking only about the missing, the whole situation is really overwhelming.”  A doctor points to damage outside the East Nile hospital in Khartoum, where airstrikes and street battles have forced thousands to flee in recent weeks. Photograph: RSF/Reuters  Despite the daunting task, the team has continued to work around the clock and are having success – managing to return 25 people to their families so far. “It feels amazing and we’re actually finding people every day as well. It feels really good in the middle of this chaos,” Khalaf said.  Like Osman, Siddig Ismail Mohamed Tahir went missing after being arrested by the RSF in late April. He had left the family home and was answering calls before his phone was turned off.  “My dad would never do that, and that’s when we knew,” said his daughter Sarah Siddig, who lives in Manchester with her sister. “It was the most horrible feeling. I could never explain the confusion, pain and fear we felt. There were a thousand things going through our heads because we knew anything could have happened.”  After five hours of trying to get through on the phone to Khartoum, she posted on social media calling for help. Eventually, information came through about where he was being held. As British citizens, the family contacted the UK Foreign Office.  “I honestly feel like they didn’t understand the urgency of the situation,” she said. But after they contacted the British ambassador to Sudan, Giles Lever, their father was released.  “I met my father in Birmingham airport, that’s where the evacuation plane arrived. We were all standing around the airport waiting for him. Once we saw him, we hugged him so tight while crying our eyes out. My dad was just laughing and telling us that he’s OK – he always does this because he never wants us to be worried about him.  Smoke over the capital, Khartoum, as fighting continued on 6 May. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images  “He had a scar on his leg after being grazed by a bullet during his detention. I remember crying so hard thinking that the bullet could have hit anywhere, but overall I’ve never felt so much relief.”  Since then, Siddig has been trying to help others find missing people, offering support and advice. “The Sudanese community is unmatched. The amount of help we got was overwhelming. People we don’t even know were risking their lives for my dad,” she said.  “It’s the hardest thing anyone can ever go through. I hope I can help as many people as I can. It’s a scary experience and I was lucky enough to have my sister’s help, many people are going through this alone.”"

In an interview with CNBC, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella stated that every time there is a new technology in the market, it is bound to displace a few jobs.  Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on AI taking away jobs  Nadella told CNBC that every time a new technology emerges, there is “real dispacement” that can take place in the job market. However, he added that Artificial Intelligence (AI) can also create new jobs.  As per his statement, “I mean, there can be a billion developers. In fact, the world needs a billion developers. So, the idea that this is actually a democratizing tool to make access to new technology and access to new knowledge easier, so that the ramp-up on the learning curve is easier.”  In a recent interview with CBS Mornings, Nadella said that the new technology still requires human beings to read, edit and approve content. He believes that AI will bring “satisfaction to current jobs and net new jobs”. He added that salaries of employees can also go up as a result of the company’s plans.  Thousands of tech luminaries including Elon Musk, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and more sent out an open letter demanding an immediate 6-month pause on training of AI systems that are more powerful than OpenAI’s GPT-4. They believe that AI can pose “profound risks to society and humanity”. Microsoft has made a multiyear, multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI and has integrated its tech in its search engine Bing.  Talking about the fast development of AI, Nadella said, “If anything, I feel, yes, it’s moving fast, but moving fast in the right direction. Humans are in the loop versus being out of the loop. It’s a design choice, which, at least, we have made.”  Bill Gates also emphasised that AI can prove to be an asset for education. Nadella believes the same. In the interview, he stated that eventually students will get access to ‘AI tutors’ who will break down and eliminate their “fear of learning”.

LAPD Capt. Kelly Muniz said the detective was in a vehicle traveling on the 110 near Gage Avenue in South Los Angeles when gunfire erupted about 10:45 a.m.  The shooting was not related to the person being tracked, and the detective — who was dressed to blend in with civilians and had no outward indications he was a police officer — was not injured, Muniz said. The unmarked vehicle, however, was struck by gunfire, she said.  Advertisement  Although Muniz declined to identify the detective’s unit, two law enforcement sources not authorized to discuss the shooting said he is part of the Special Investigation Section of the Robbery-Homicide Division, which tracks potential suspects in violent, often serial, crimes.  Muniz said two suspects have been taken into custody in connection with the shooting, although no one has been booked yet.  A motive has yet to be determined, authorities said.  California Since photos’ release, LAPD has been quietly scrubbing police rosters from portal As the hand-wringing at Los Angeles police headquarters continues over the release of police officers’ pictures, the city has apparently been quietly scrubbing the names and ranks of cops from its public records website.  Despite no immediate evidence to support it, speculation spread quickly among LAPD personnel as to whether the detective’s cover may have been revealed by the recent online publication of a database of LAPD photos that includes those working in the Special Investigation Section, or SIS.  Attorneys for the city filed a lawsuit in April against Knock LA journalist Ben Camacho and the Stop LAPD Spying Coalition, saying the release of the officers’ names, photos and serial numbers in response to a public records request and related litigation was “inadvertent.”  They argued that publication of the images of officers who serve in undercover assignments posed a safety risk. After receiving the photos, Camacho provided them to the Stop LAPD Spying Coalition, which published them online in an accessible database.  In one of several declarations filed by the city, LAPD Capt. Jonathan Tippet, who oversees the Robbery-Homicide Division, wrote that the publication had exposed the photos of undercover officers, including those in the SIS unit. Tippet said the images “permanently endangered the lives of the officers” and “jeopardize the investigation of significant criminal cases.”  Lawyers for the Camacho have called it a “thinly veiled attempt to silence” him and other journalists who report on law enforcement and “shield the Los Angeles Police Department from any measure of accountability and transparency.”  A judge last month rejected an initial effort by the city of Los Angeles to force the return of more than 9,000 photos and names of LAPD officers by rejecting a request for a temporary restraining order that would have prevented Camacho and the watchdog group from doing anything with the data.  The judge said that the case was essentially about prior restraint and that the city would need to address it and wider 1st Amendment issues before any decisions would be made."

To be eligible for the Academy Awards’ best picture category, a film must have a minimum 40-minute runtime. Almodóvar’s movie runs 31 minutes. With those extra nine minutes, we could also highlight the worthiness of actors Ethan Hawke and Pedro Pascal and the project’s artisan categories. But for his second English language endeavor, coming three years after “The Human Voice” with Tilda Swinton, the Spanish auteur’s sensibilities are never lacking. His new Spanish Western stands proudly next to some of his most audacious movies such as “Talk to Her” and “Volver.”  More from Variety  A rainy Wednesday in the south of France didn’t keep crowds of ticket rushers and fans from trying to get a glimpse of Almodóvar’s short film starring Pascal and Hawke. Almodóvar and Hawke participated in a post-screening Q&A to discuss the project, sitting next to translators. Pascal was not in attendance, reportedly due to going into production this week for an unnamed role in Ridley Scott’s “Gladiator 2.”  The film tells the story of Silva (Pascal), who rides a horse across the desert to visit his friend Jake (Hawke), who is a sheriff. What follows is a story of vengeance, intrigue and forbidden love.  Almodóvar referenced Westerns such Jane Campion’s “The Power of the Dog” as a source of inspiration. “The lead character’s sexuality is kind of ambivalent,” Almodóvar said about Campion’s film. “But they didn’t fuck.” The line drew an eruption of laughter from the audience.  Story continues  Hawke talked about how the act of pointing a camera at someone is in itself an act of love. “You are saying these people are important enough to care about. It’s always about love, in some capacity. I just like to be wanted. And if happens to be an extremely attractive man…I just like it.”  Discussing his character Jake, a sheriff who is torn by 25 years of forbidden love and the justice he aims to serve, he found the realism in his depiction. “There’s a way that we are, and a way we want to be. They’re not always the same. It creates cracks in us. Lies in us. I found him to be a fascinating character.”  Almodóvar and Hawke shared their admirations of the genre with both declaring at some point during their conversation, “The Western is very much alive.”  In a world where auteurs are becoming increasingly entitled to overly long runtimes, “Strange Way of Life” begs for more and could have easily been a full-length feature.  Signature Almodóvar imagery is on display, with wine pouring from barrels in an erotic scene that depicts younger versions of Silva and Jake. Pascal also sports a bold green jacket on his horse and a shirt that hangs just low enough to keep him from going full frontal for the audience, although his bare butt will make his fans plenty excited.  Distributed by Sony Pictures Classics, the film will be released later in 2023.  Best of Variety  Sign up for Variety’s Newsletter.

Chadians and international relief organizations already on-site to address Chad’s own food shortfalls have been doing what they can to feed and shelter the refugees – even if that means only a watery bowl of porridge and a bedsheet tied to tree branches.  And as the war rages on, the scene in Chad is being repeated in many of Sudan’s other neighbors, as refugees pour into Horn of Africa nations already facing rising hunger as a result of conflict, drought, and economic turmoil.  The lengthening lines of refugees illustrate how Sudan’s war – a surprise to most of the world when the armed forces and a powerful paramilitary organization began fighting in the capital Khartoum a month ago – is adding to the rising numbers of acutely hungry people around the world.  “What we are facing is really a wildfire of spreading food insecurity,” says Martin Frick, director of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) Berlin office.  Wars and protracted conflicts – from Yemen and Syria to Afghanistan – were already contributing heavily to the world’s food security crisis. Now this war, in a global hunger hot spot, is exacerbating a crisis that even before this year had wiped out previous steady progress in reducing acute hunger.  For one thing, the Sudan war has erupted at a time when global food prices are particularly high, sent skyward by the war in Ukraine – one of the world’s critical breadbaskets – and by lingering pandemic supply chain disruptions.  Hunger’s four C’s  That has added a new “C” – cost – to what food experts previously called the “3 C’s” of the food insecurity crisis: conflict, COVID-19, and climate change.  With 345 million people facing acute food insecurity, according to the WFP – more than double the 135 million in the same straits in 2019 – the international community is battling to cope with new conflicts, multiplying weather disasters, and signs that major donors will not be contributing as much as usual.  Story continues  The U.N. organization says the 345 million are now in 79 countries – “many, many more [countries] than in 2019,” Mr. Frick adds.  Increasingly intense and destructive weather is one factor, he says – last year’s epochal flooding in Pakistan and extended drought in Africa are just two examples.  But with armed conflict considered the biggest single driver of food insecurity, Mr. Frick notes that the number of “live wars” is double what it was a decade ago.  “The number of protracted wars ... is not going down, and then we have the new wars in Ukraine and now Sudan that add to the already high numbers” of people facing food insecurity, he says.  Shaky grain deal  Russia’s war in Ukraine has been particularly damaging, Mr. Frick adds, since before the invasion more than 400 million people – many in countries with vulnerable populations – depended on Ukraine’s grain.  Last year the U.N. and Turkey brokered a deal with Ukraine and Russia to provide safe passage for shipments of Ukrainian grain from Black Sea ports. The deal has been a success, U.N. and other experts say, allowing Ukraine to safely export about 30 million metric tons of grains and other foods.  Indeed, the WFP has been one of the major beneficiaries of the deal, with the organization procuring about 600,000 metric tons of grains for its operations in a number of countries, including Afghanistan, Ethiopia, and Somalia.  But now the agreement appears to be on shaky ground; Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced Wednesday that the deal had been extended for two months, but its future remains uncertain: Russia is threatening to pull out if it doesn’t reap more benefits for its own food and fertilizer producers.  “Russia must stop holding global food security hostage to its cynical power plays and profit-taking,” Robert Wood, the deputy U.S. ambassador to the U.N., said before a Security Council session that discussed the grain deal on Monday.  Russia counters that the grain deal as implemented is helping wealthy Western countries bring down food prices more than it is benefitting the world’s hungry.  Domestic pressures  Signs that “donor fatigue” could be setting in among some traditional food aid providers are also spurring concerns. Falling or internally redirected humanitarian budgets in some countries suggest that domestic pressures to focus on post-pandemic recovery at home may be undermining enthusiasm about addressing the global crisis.  When a series of food price shocks struck developing countries in 2007-08, “we saw an impressive number of countries in the international community come together to address that,” says Catherine Maldonado, senior director for food security with Mercy Corps.  “But now food prices are up around the globe,” she adds, “and that has made it hard for some to join in a global response when some of these same issues they would be addressing with humanitarian funding are being felt at home.”  Against that backdrop, the G-7 group of developed nations is set to take up the food security issue when leaders meet in Hiroshima, Japan, this weekend.  Mr. Frick of the WFP says Western countries have responded the most generously to the burgeoning food assistance needs, with the United States, Germany, and the European Union leading the way. The result? A record $14 billion in the agency’s food assistance coffers.  Still, he echoes Ms. Maldonado in noting that “domestic problems” in a number of hitherto reliable donor countries are raising concerns that the world simply can’t continue to boost humanitarian giving as needs rise.  “Countries have been generous, but we also recognize these issues that lead to fears we won’t be able to sustain the same levels of funding this year,” he says.  Reaction vs. prevention  Yet what worries some experts at least as much as humanitarian funding is how global attention tends to focus on the crisis of the moment, such as Sudan. That can distract attention from areas already in difficulty that need more help to avert widespread extreme hunger or even famine.  “Our focus on these big crises means we aren’t talking enough about what we could be doing now to prevent the places that are already in a tight spot from reaching the tipping point,” worries Ms. Maldonado, who is based in Guatemala.  Indeed, the U.N. and other organizations estimate that the number of people facing some level of hunger or unreliable food supplies – though not yet suffering from acute food insecurity – is nearing 830 million, up from some 660 million in 2019.  The “big crises” have not deterred the WFP from pursuing its development mandate, which includes projects aimed at boosting sustainable small-scale food production in some of the world’s food-insecure hot spots.  Mr. Frick points to one project to develop “resilience villages” in parts of Niger where food production had practically ceased. But with the introduction of water reclamation measures, lands could once again support crops and livestock.  Then when Niger’s worst food security crisis in decades hit in 2022, 80% of the “resilience villages” were able to weather the crisis without humanitarian assistance.  “These projects give people hope to pursue their future where before it seemed there might not be one,” Mr. Frick says, “but they also demonstrate how there are solutions to the global food security crisis.”  Ms. Maldonado of Mercy Corps cites solar-driven irrigation projects she visited in drought-stricken Ethiopia and Somalia in February as the kinds of initiatives that will pay long-term dividends in the battle against food insecurity.  “These projects are helping people stay in place, hold on to the assets like livestock they still have, and are allowing women farmers the stability they need” to form income-producing cooperatives, she says.  “We can’t afford to lose sight of these efforts that are helping communities on the brink,” Ms. Maldonado says. “More of this is what is needed now,” she adds, “so that we don’t see in the coming years the kind of increase in people crossing that tipping point to acute hunger that we’ve seen this year.”  Related stories  Read this story at csmonitor.com  Become a part of the Monitor community"

Stress can cause the body to release hormones such as cortisol, which can affect the immune system and increase inflammation in the body. This inflammation can trigger or worsen skin conditions such as psoriasis and seborrhea.  Besides these conditions, stress can also contribute to acne as a result of increased lipid production, and may cause vitiligo, known for a long time as a disease that breaks out in many patients following a traumatic event such as a car accident, injury to a relative or mental stress experienced for a long period.  Urticaria (hives) is also one of the physical ailments that can erupt from stress, and in Israel, hundreds of thousands of patients develop hives, but for varying reasons it's less known and not always correctly diagnosed.  Hives are when red and itchy lesions on the skin's surface appear and disappear unexpectedly in different areas of the body. The itching is extremely severe and the lesions come and go on their own and affect the patient's quality of life, from concentration in daily activities, even to waking up.  A woman is frustrated while working from her computer with notebooks all around her (Illustrative) (credit: PXHERE)  The trigger is hard to identify  There's often a confusion of terms between hives, allergies and other skin problems, so public awareness is very important. If someone has an itchy rash that doesn't go away after several days, they must see a dermatologist or allergist for an exam, especially if one is in a risk group, i.e. people with a family history of asthma, allergic rhinitis, allergic eye inflammation, atopic dermatitis (asthma of the skin), etc.  There are two types of urticaria: acute and chronic. Acute urticaria is more common, in which lesions appear suddenly and disappear within a few days, but there's a possibility of repeated flare-ups for months or years, which are usually short. Chronic urticaria lasts six weeks or more without respite.  Other factors, besides stress and anxiety, that may cause outbreaks are infectious diseases, certain medications, contact with various substances, contact with plants and animals, internal diseases hidden from view, and more.  In most cases, however, it's very difficult to identify the trigger, so it's important to do blood tests to rule out any internal medical problems, and if nothing unusual is found, drug treatment should be started.  Warning signs  Urticaria isn't considered a life-threatening phenomenon when it appears in places such as the arms, legs, chest and abdomen, but in some people urticaria can be accompanied by swelling of the soft tissues under the skin.  This swelling called angioedema may appear on the face, eyelids, lips, ears, mouth, hands, legs or genitals, and is sometimes accompanied by pain.  When urticaria manifests itself in the respiratory tract or the tongue, it can be life-threatening, as it can block the respiratory tract, and this warning sign requires one to see a doctor urgently at a health fund, an urgent care center, or the emergency room.  Treatment Methods  The first step of drug treatment is using antihistamines that reduce the activity of the mediator of inflammation (histamine), a molecule found inside the body, which causes blood vessels to dilate and smooth muscle tissues to contract.  The first generation of antihistamines have a sedative effect, so taking them should be calculated and activities such as driving must be avoided. The second generation of antihistamines are non-sedating, so they can be given in higher doses (up to 4 pills a day) if one pill doesn't help.  In recent years, following a change in the requirements of the health basket that makes it much easier for patients, steroids which have harsh side effects are being used less.  Instead, there's now an advanced biological drug that opposes the activity of the IGE antibodies which are secreted from the mast cells and releases histamine. This is a very effective medicine that is taken once every four weeks, works very well and really improves the quality of life for patients.  So if you've been diagnosed with urticaria and despite treatment, there is no relief, see a dermatologist who knows how to prescribe advanced medications that will prevent much suffering.  In any case, if it's really a skin disease that broke out as a result of mental stress, first it's important to identify the source and find healthy ways to deal with it mentally as well.

All key stakeholders need to be active to ensure this comes to an end.  The violent incidents that recently erupted in Manipur, forcing the state government to impose a curfew in eight districts, suspend internet services, and the Central government to deploy the paramilitary forces and the army to restore law and order, were not wholly unexpected. In terms of de-escalation of decades-long violence by the militant groups, the hard-earned peace looks to be under threat with the unfolding of the recent episodes of violence in Manipur. Based on the deep-rooted ethnic divide (read especially between the majority valley-based Meiteis and the hill-based Kuki minorities), the eruption of violent clashes throws vital signs of an inevitable civil war-like situation unless the everyday politics of fear, anxiety, insecurity, and the mutual distrust among the ethnic groups are identified and addressed with immediate effect.  Going by the statement of the Chief Minister of Manipur, Biren Singh, the episodes of violence have claimed more than 60 lives, injured 200 people, displaced 35,000 people, and burnt down 1,700 houses so far. While the reports reflect upon the triggering points (miscreants vandalising the venue of the Chief Minister’s programme at Churachandpur on 28 April, followed by the burning down of the Anglo-Kuki War centenary Gate on 3 May, and the ‘Tribal Solidarity March’ led by the All Tribal Students Union of Manipur (ATSUM) on the same day) that led to the outbreak of the violent episodes, there is a need to analyse the larger spectrum of ethnic conflict in Manipur. This article reflects on the issues around which the deep-rooted ethnic conflicts are perceived, pursued, and sustained in Manipur.  Assertive identities and contesting indigeneity  Arguably, a fundamental factor contributing to most of the conflicts in Manipur is the deep-rooted ethnic divide among the Meiteis, Nagas, and Kukis. Over the years, the assertion of ethnic identities continues to shape the social, political, and economic relationships (read conflictual) among these groups. The source of such conflictual interactions among ethnic groups can be attributed to the competing and contesting ideas of indigeneity. The divergent imagination of ‘a home land’ often strengthens and sustains the ethnic divide among these groups. Moreover, ethnic assertion coupled with majoritarian demands by the individual groups also contributes to the ethnic faultline.  Over the years, the assertion of ethnic identities continues to shape the social, political, and economic relationships (read conflictual) among these groups.  Accordingly, the idea of ‘Manipur’ varies from one group to the other. Most Meiteis, concentrated mainly in and around Imphal Valley, often see themselves as the custodian and the protector of Manipuri integrity. The indigeneity of the minority tribal communities, especially the Kukis, is often questioned and rejected. While the Meiteis are often alleged to subscribe to majoritarianism, irrespective of the political party in power, the intense demands by the Kukis and the Nagas were also viewed as a threat to the territorial integrity of Manipur by the Meiteis. It is essential to mention that the Nagas’ subscription to Nagalim would take away some portions of Manipur. Similarly, the imagination of a Kuki land-Zale’n-gam also removes some parts of the present Manipur state. In such a scenario of contested indigeneity coupled with divergent and competing narratives of territoriality, the ethnic conflicts among these groups only get consolidated.  The fear of NRC  One of the recent issues that advance the ethnic divide in Manipur is the demand for introducing the National Register for Citizens (NRC) in Manipur. This demand is mainly led by various Meitei organisations supported by the Manipuri Nagas. The demand for the NRC grew with the N Biren Singh government retaining power in the 2022 state assembly election. Massive rallies were organised in March this year by the Meitei and Naga organisations demanding the immediate introduction of NRC. The demand for the NRC can be reasoned against an alleged rise in the population of ‘illegal immigrants’ in Manipur. Talking of the ‘illegal immigrants,’ one can easily make out that the demand for the NRC is mostly on the suspicion that the Kukis are providing the Chins from neighbouring Myanmar safe passage and settlement in the Kuki-inhabited hills of Manipur. Such a narrative alleging the role of the Kukis in the rise of the ‘illegal immigrant’ population allows the Meiteis and the Nagas to share a common ground. Accordingly, the opportunist alliance between the Meiteis and the Nagas hold the Kukis responsible for posing a threat to Manipur by changing the state’s demography. Moreover, the Kukis are also alleged to be involved in illegal poppy cultivation and drug business that seriously threaten the state.  It is essential to mention that the Nagas’ subscription to Nagalim would take away some portions of Manipur.  As the Kukis are seen as foreigners and outsiders, the escalated demands for the NRC add to the apprehensions of the former. However, with the military Junta taking over power in Myanmar in 2021, the influx of the Chin-Zomi-Kuki-Mizo tribes to Manipur cannot be ruled out. Nevertheless, whether the influx of Chins from Myanmar has outnumbered the local population in Manipur, as alleged by the Nagas and the Meiteis, needs a thorough investigation. As the demands for NRC are gaining momentum, the responses of the state government add to the fear and anxiety of the Kukis and advance the ethnic strife in Manipur.  Responding to the NRC demand, Biren Singh in March 2023 announced that the Manipur State Population Commission (MSPC) will identify the illegal immigrants based on a house-to-house survey. What added to the mistrust among Kukis was the state government’s aggressive drive against poppy cultivation in the hills of Manipur. Several households belonging to the Kukis have faced eviction as the state government declared the land as protected/reserved forest areas. What accentuated the conflicts was the demolition of the tribal colony and a church belonging to the Kukis in the wee hours on 11 April 2023.  The Kukis are also alleged to be involved in illegal poppy cultivation and drug business that seriously threaten the state.  The state government’s demolition and eviction drives, the process of ‘othering’ by terming the Kukis as outsiders and foreigners, alleging the Kukis were responsible for the poppy cultivation and influx of ‘illegal migrants from Myanmar, and the Meitei community’s demand for the tribal status wrapped with the old wounds of ethnic strife have directly contributed to the revival of violent incidents in restive Manipur.  Conclusion  With active Central intervention, the violent incidents appear to have subsided for now. However, given the fragile nature of relationships among the warring ethnic groups, one has to be very cautious before drawing any conclusion on the situation in Manipur. The reluctance of warring ethnic groups to have constructive dialogues regarding the equitable distribution of resources greatly enhances the risk of violent conflicts in future.  Given the fragile nature of relationships among the warring ethnic groups, one has to be very cautious before drawing any conclusion on the situation in Manipur.  Further, the ongoing conflicts in Myanmar will continue to have some spill-over effects on Manipur. Migration from Myanmar poses a serious challenge to maintaining ethnic peace in Manipur. The conflict between the political rigidity of the modern state boundaries and the flexibility of the social and fraternal ties between the tribal communities across the borders also hurts the ethnic relations in Manipur. As the State government’s responses to the demands and grievances of the ethnic communities seem to be governed by majoritarian sentiments, the restoration of peace among conflicting groups is going to be a major challenge. A much-suggested dialogue among the ethnic groups would serve very little unless the current dispensation in Manipur shows fairness and neutrality in dealing with ethnic groups and diverse communities.

Nasri Warsame, a political newcomer and Somali immigrant who is running for the seat currently held by Aisha Chughtai, said Wednesday: “I do not condone violence. I do not condone intimidation or harassment of any sort.”  Saturday's convention was held to endorse a candidate for the Minneapolis City Council race. Video circulating on social media shows a disturbance happened after supporters of Chughtai took the stage to seek the delegates’ backing for the seat. That sparked an uproar among Warsame's supporters.  Some jumped on stage, shouting, banging on tables and waving signs. At least two people were injured, and the convention broke up with no endorsement.  Warsame's campaign manager, Abshir Omar, said Wednesday that Warsame’s supporters were victims — not perpetrators. Omar said Warsame’s supporters — who are primarily Black, Muslim and immigrants — have been the target of racism.  Political Cartoons View All 990 Images  Chughtai released a statement saying: “The Warsame campaign is asking you to believe their version of events, which are clearly not what we all saw on the videos. This convention used the same open and transparent process that the DFL has always used, and was agreed to by both campaigns.""  Chughtai's spokesperson, Akhi Menawat, said previously that he didn’t think the dispute had anything to do with ethnicity or race.  Minnesota Democratic leaders are holding an emergency meeting Thursday to determine if rules need to change as a result of the disturbance. Ken Martin, chair of the state Democratic Party organization, has said he would use the meeting to propose a change that would “ban individuals engaged in violent assaults” from the party and “take immediate action to remove the folks involved.""  Both Warsame and Chughtai are Democratic candidates in an overwhelmingly Democratic city where campaigns for party backing are often heated.  Warsame is a political newcomer who is campaigning on a law-and-order message. Chughtai is a longtime activist who managed U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar’s 2018 campaign. She is the daughter of Pakistani immigrants and has endorsements from a long list of progressive and labor groups, including the Democratic Socialists of America.  __  Trisha Ahmed is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

Stream: “I Won’t Turn You Away” – Rachel Croft        Were there an entirely different song soundtracking it, watching Rachel Croft walk through a picturesque sun-dappled landscape could have been a moment of bliss; a brief escape into bucolic, pastoral delights far removed from our otherwise busy, bustling lives. The sun might have felt warm as its rays streaked across the ground, hitting the camera in such a way that produced vivid starbursts and colorful lens flares on the film. The image of a lone woman walking through the forest might have felt quaint – even poetic.  Watching it all through the perspective of “I Won’t Turn You Away,” it just hurts. A visceral eruption from intimate, raw depths, Rachel Croft’s new song is a a cinematic reckoning with grief and loss that aches with intense pain, love, and longing. It’s a smoldering reminder of loss’ irreconcilable and enduring permanence; of death’s all-consuming nature; and of the sheer unavoidable weight of a loved one’s absence.  There’s rain in your hair  It’s stained all your shoes  The kind that falls lightly  The kind that can soak you right through  Step through the door  Bags in your hand  And words on your face  Words that you had all planned but  Atwood Magazine is proud to be premiering “I Won’t Turn You Away,” Rachel Croft’s first single of 2023 (independently out May 19, 2023). Active throughout the past six years, Croft has made a name for herself throughout London and beyond as an emotive and uncompromising alternative artist. Her 2021 EP Reap What You Sow remains a stirring example of the brute power and pure passion she puts not only into her voice, but also into every other aspect of her work.        Following on the heels of last year’s standalone singles “Hurricane” and “Weaver Bird,” “I Won’t Turn You Away” finds Croft unapologetic and at the top of her game, channeling a deep inner pain into cathartic musical beauty.  “‘I Won’t Turn You Away’ is a colossal, slow-burning ballad about grief, and the struggle to let go,” she tells Atwood Magazine. “When you begin writing and your eyes fill with tears, that’s when you know you’re really digging into something that’s real.”  The first time Croft sings the refrain, “I won’t turn you away,” her voice is a soft and brooding hush. That subdued energy doesn’t last long; her spirit rises as she sings the second verse over lilting piano chords, ultimately coming to a fever pitch. It’s as if through spilling her guts through song, she can rid herself of these overwhelming emotions eating away inside her.  Where will you go  Is it somewhere I’d know  I hope that it’s peaceful there  Cliché of blue skies, fresh air  I won’t turn you away  No I won’t turn you away  No I won’t ask you to stay  But I can’t leave us this way        “Grief is so complex, and at the time of writing this song, I was seemingly surrounded by different types of it all at once,” Croft explains. “When you write to that person who’s lost someone, what the hell do you even say? I don’t blame people at all for not wanting to let go, to live with the memories and keep them alive. This song was written from their point of view.”  “We shaped the song like the outburst of real emotion. It builds, then erupts, then sputters, ebbs and quietens. I love the journey in songs and I try to really bring imagery out in the words. I want the film scene to play in your head, immerse you in the story. Cinema and drama has always been something that massively inspires all of my songwriting.”  “‘I Won’t Turn You Away’ was the easiest song I ever recorded. I told Isaac (McInnis, of Crooked Room Studio) I wanted a wall of sound. He just got it. Within a matter of hours we had this massive sounding demo which I couldn’t stop listening to all night. It made me cry happy tears because he totally fucking nailed it. I never knew it could be so effortless. The result was just so raw and powerful, so unrestricted. This song didn’t really have the easiest start, even though I was really proud of it, somewhere along the way it was forgotten. I’m so glad it came up for discussion on our demo day, and I didn’t give up on it. I knew this one could be so powerful.”        When you’re really in it, grief feels unavoidable and all-consuming, and “I Won’t Turn You Away” captures that experience with stunning finesse.  Even as we watch Croft walk through the woods in her Andy Little-directed visualizer, we can’t help but feel a cool chill run down the spine. Only when she breaks out and really lets loose do our bones start to warm up – and even then, we’re still unsettled. Loss means that even euphoria – even catharsis – has a shadow; a darkness that no amount of light can get rid of.  Still, that outpouring does feel good; it’s the musical and emotional climax Croft needed to make for herself, and the one that all but ensures we keep returning to this song for months and years to come. Stream Rachel Croft’s “I Won’t Turn You Away” exclusively on Atwood Magazine!  Memories cling to this place  Nothing stings like your name  I’ve never seen such a waste  ‘Cos it’s just me and the rain  I won’t turn you away  No I won’t turn you away  I can’t breathe through this pain  But I won’t turn you away  — —  Stream: “I Won’t Turn You Away” – Rachel Croft        — — — —  Connect to Rachel Croft on  TikTok, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram  © Andy Little  :: Stream Rachel Croft ::    "

He was there to personally oversee the implementation of his agreement with the Biden administration, which includes maintaining over 20,000 Mexican soldiers deployed along the border and receiving tens of thousands of migrants expelled from the US, who are then being detained and deported or sent to southern Mexico.  López Obrador with military commanders inspecting $570 million worth of new security infrastructure built along the border between Tamaulipas and Texas [Photo: @lopezobrador_]  Surrounded by military helicopters and trucks with marines, soldiers, and police, López Obrador, also known as AMLO, gladly stopped near the customs station for a publicity stunt organized by the SNITIS “independent union.”  Expressing their vile nationalist indifference to the plight of migrants, the SNITIS officials held two massive saint-like pictures of AMLO under the phrase “The poor come first” and declared on social media: “The message he sends to workers is that he will always protect us.”  The officials handed the Mexican president a T-shirt bearing the image of SNITIS founder and lawyer Susana Prieto and a slogan calling for a constitutional amendment reducing the workweek from 48 hours to 40 hours. Prieto, who became a national legislator for López Obrador’s Morena party, has raised this demand among Morena legislators, who have reportedly frozen the initiative. Meanwhile, the government already lets companies freely violate the 48-hour limit and numerous other rights.  On January 21, 2019, shortly after AMLO took power, tens of thousands of auto-parts, electronics and other manufacturing workers marched to the same international bridge to call on US workers to join their struggle against the transnational corporations.  As reported by the World Socialist Web Site at the time, workers shouted: “Gringos, wake up!” and held signs proclaiming it a historic day for the labor movement.  Days earlier, wildcat strikes had erupted across dozens of maquiladora factories in Matamoros, organized by rank-and-file strike committees and mass assemblies outside the plants and in the town’s central park. They demanded a 100 percent wage increase and the removal of the unions affiliated to the gangster-ridden Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM).  Soon after, lawyers and officials of so-called “independent unions” associated with Morena and the US AFL-CIO union bureaucracy parachuted into town to contain the movement. Prieto, who had a long history of collaborating with the AFL-CIO and Morena, played the central role in promoting illusions in AMLO and initially allowing the CTM gangsters to regain control and sell out the strikes. Then, she founded the “independent union” SNITIS to win over numerous contracts and dues without significantly changing conditions at the plants.  With Prieto repeatedly attacking the World Socialist Web Site, this intervention was particularly driven by concerns about the growing influence of the socialist and internationalist perspective advanced by the WSWS during the strike movement.  Seeing its fears confirmed of a wider rank-and-file rebellion against the CTM in Mexico that could spread internationally, the US government under Donald Trump demanded in trade negotiations that Mexico implement legal provisions to channel anger at the CTM behind new “independent unions.”  Morena then fast-tracked a federal labor reform that came into effect on May 1, 2019, establishing that all labor contracts in the country would expire on May 1, 2023, unless unions renewed them through votes at each workplace.  According to official data, only 17,011 contracts were renewed in time and only about 250 were voted down, out of 139,000 contracts nationwide—until recently, officials had estimated that there were 500,000 formal contracts.  The conditions stipulated in the expired contracts will remain valid, but employers must stop paying automatic dues to the phantom unions that were once used to implement the contracts, in most cases without the knowledge of the workers.  In the last couple of years, a handful of cases were picked up by the corporate media and politicians to proclaim a dawn of “union democracy” in Mexico, where contracts were won by “independent unions” trained and financed by the AFL-CIO’s Solidarity Center. This organization is almost entirely funded by the US National Endowment for Democracy (NED), which was formed to carry out overtly the kind of political influence operations that the CIA previously oversaw covertly.  While AMLO today denounces Washington’s support for NGOs trying to destabilize his government, his own government has helped cultivate a faction of the Mexican union bureaucracy that is more closely controlled by US imperialism. He welcomed the pledge by US Vice President Kamala Harris in 2021 to spend $130 million to fund so-called “democratic unions” in Mexico.  The tiny fraction of contracts rejected—and even fewer replaced by new unions—demonstrates that this was a state-run operation mainly targeting ongoing or looming rebellions against the established unions.  Despite massive funding and support from the US government, Morena and its numerous pseudo-left satellites, the failure of these “independent” unions to gain any significant following nationally demonstrates that they are the product not of any revolt from below, but rather of a state and US-backed intervention from above.  The most publicized case took place at the General Motors Silao Complex in central Mexico, where the Solidarity Center used cash payments and lawyers to destroy a rank-and-file group that had organized itself to drive out the CTM union. The US government handpicked a few workers to register and impose an “independent union,” SINTTIA. As soon as it was voted in with a contract including miserable wages, SINTTIA immediately betrayed its promises of defending workers from victimization and numerous abuses by management.  López Obrador holds T-shirt with Susana Prieto's image, Matamoros, Tamapulipas, May 13 [Photo: SNITIS]  The stunt this weekend by Susana Prieto’s SNITIS union in Matamoros to glorify AMLO as he implements Biden’s orders to attack migrant workers stands alongside the open meetings between the SINTTIA leadership in Silao and US Ambassador Ken Salazar as naked expressions of the nationalist and reactionary character of the “independent” union scheme.  In 2022, unions were compelled to make 516 strike authorization announcements, mostly as part of the contract renewal processes, but only seven strikes were formally declared and all but one ended quickly.  In the context of rampant inflation, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the US-NATO war against Russia in Ukraine and US preparations for war against China, AMLO and his union partners in Mexico are fulfilling a fundamental service to US imperialism and its war drive.  On the eve of his trip to Matamoros, AMLO boasted at a press briefing last Friday that Mexico had consolidated its position as Washington’s top trade partner. “The US could not function without us,” he said according to Jornada, adding: “Within our territory, there are auto-parts plants that supply the war industry of that country.”  In September 1938, exactly one year before the eruption of World War II, Leon Trotsky summarized US role in Latin America as that of “the gendarme of imperialist foreign exploitation.” Writing from exile in Coyoacán, Mexico, where he would be assassinated by an agent of the Stalinist bureaucracy just two years later, Trotsky stated that US policy “necessarily fuels the revolutionary resistance of the Latin American people, whom it must exploit with growing intensity.”  This assessment retains all of its validity as thousands of troops mass on both sides of the sprawling industrial-commercial belt along the US-Mexico border, and the governments in Washington and Mexico City, along with their agents in the union bureaucracies, attempt to suppress the class struggle. These efforts are creating the conditions for a massive eruption which must be prepared through the building of a new revolutionary internationalist leadership fighting to unite the struggles of workers in Mexico and the US against their common enemy."

Communal violence erupted in Akola city and Shevgaon village in Maharashtra's Ahmednagar district in the previous two days in response to a religious message on social media, posing a challenge to authorities in preventing further flare-ups.  As a result of the situation, authorities have imposed curfews in some areas. So far, around 147 people have been detained.

With the investigation pending, officials urged that although ""the matter remains under investigation,"" the fire's cause has so far been determined to be ""not suspicious in nature.""  On May 3 at 5:30 a.m., fire departments from the neighboring towns of Estelline, Castlewood, Bryant, Hayti, and Badger responded to a call that smoke was erupting out of the Lake Norden fire department building. Upon arrival at the scene, fire fighters worked nearly six hours to put out the fire. However, the fire had already erupted by the time they got to the scene, and the building and the fire trucks were eventually lost. When all was said and done the building and all the fire equipment inside it had been destroyed, as well as five fire trucks and two ambulances.  “When we were called we were told flames were coming through the roof,” said Estelline fire chief Max Quarter, who was one of the first on the scene. “There were fire trucks completely surrounding it. I couldn’t see anything but white smoke and hoses. The roof [had] collapsed in, it had fallen straight into the building.”  The fire is a massive loss for the volunteer-staffed Lake Norden fire department, who rely on tax dollars for funding. It could be years before the destroyed equipment is able to be fully replaced, said Roy Hauschildt, the Lake Norden fire marshall.  ADVERTISEMENT  ""We are a district entity. We get tax dollars in, but it's a very limited source for any budgetary needs,"" Hauschildt said. ""It could be many years before we get back all the equipment we lost, depending on how everything comes together. They haven't let us back inside the building due to the ongoing investigation so I don't know exactly how much has been destroyed.""  Quarter agreed that recovery will be a long road.  “The loss is huge,” Quarter said. “One fire suit might cost three-thousand dollars, and they might last ten years. Funding is always a challenge for volunteer fire departments”  Efforts to recoup the costs of the losses have been started, with an account at the Lake Norden First Premier Bank that is currently accepting money from those who wish to help donate to the fire department, said Hauschildt.  In the meantime while rebuilding efforts are undergone by Lake Norden, coverage duties for the Lake Norden area will be split among volunteer fire departments in Hayti, Bryant, Badger and Estelline, each located approximately ten minutes north, south, east, and west of Lake Norden."

The fire at 118 White House School Road was reported at about 7:45 p.m. Tuesday, according to Chief Don French of the Madison Fire Department.  The family of five, which includes three young children, was dining out at the time, leaving five dogs at home.  None of the pets was hurt because a passerby happened to spot the fire and let the dogs out of the single-story house before calling firefighters, French said.  The house was engulfed in flames when firefighters arrived, he said. A nearby pickup truck also sustained minor damage.  The blaze drew firefighters from Madison, Anson, Norridgewock, Skowhegan and Starks. French said firefighters were at the scene until about 10 p.m.  The Office of State Fire Marshal has conducted an investigation, French said, and believes one of the family’s dogs inadvertently turned on one of the burners. It is not clear if the dog was trying to reach food on the stove.  “The stove wasn’t on when the homeowner left. They checked it,” French said. “We believe that the dog turned one of the valves on the stove, and there was something on top of the stove that probably caught fire. They said macaroni and cheese, or something like that.”  The family was with a relative Wednesday, French said, while the American Red Cross was trying to find a place for the family to stay.

We dangerous."" Those were the words the flew out of Byron Buxton's mouth following Minnesota's 5-1 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers on Tuesday night.  Buxton went 2-for-4 with a walk and a pair of stolen bases in the win, which saw right-hander Bailey Ober outperform Clayton Kershaw to give the Twins their first victory at Dodger Stadiium since 2005.  ""It just shows how different we are — our mentality and who we are becoming as a team,"" Buxton said, according to the Star Tribune. ""We didn't go out there today like, 'Oh, Kershaw's pitching.' It was like, 'They're facing the Twins. … You've got to pitch to us. We nasty. We dangerous.' And once we get it clicking, it's going to be way worse.""  Buxton's confident claim comes following a four-game stretch where the bats have been firing on all cylinders. Minnesota scored 29 runs in three games against the Cubs, marking a franchise record for most runs in a three-game series at Target Field, and have followed with 14 runs in two games against the Dodgers.  Nasty? Dangerous? Debatable.  This is the same Twins offense that entering play a week ago...  Had the worst team batting average in all of baseball...  Had the third-worst team on-base percentage...  Had the fewest hits in the majors...  Had the second-lowest contact rate in the majors...  Was hitting .219 with runners in scoring position...  Over the last seven days (seven games) the Twins are hitting .291/.369/.534 as a team with 12 homers and 18 doubles. Their 47 runs in the past seven days is the most in the big leagues, six more than the next most (Cardinals with 41).  Maybe Buxton is on to something and the past seven days is a sign that they're beginning to click. But he seems to be basing the ""nasty"" and dangerous"" claim on a seven day eruption whereas the Twins' meager offense was based on a much larger sample size of 36 games.  If Buxton is right – and the pitching keeps up its pace as one of the top units in the game – then the Twins really will be a nasty opponent for every other team going forward."

Beirut, Lebanon – For seven years, Moussa al-Omari has been postponing his military service in Syria. But knowing he was running out of legitimate reasons, he left the country in August last year and entered Lebanon legally through the airport.  Seeing March this year was the final month of his exemption from service, al-Omari – whose name has been changed for security reasons – was hoping he would receive legal residency in Lebanon, but he said his request was rejected by the Lebanese authorities.  “They told me; ‘It’s OK, you can stay illegally. No one will bother you.’ And just three or four weeks ago, they started deporting everyone who doesn’t have a legal stay,” al-Omari told Al Jazeera.  “I’ve just been hiding at home since then.”  Twenty-five-year-old al-Omari, along with more than a million Syrians finding refuge in Lebanon – the majority of whom have been in the country since the eruption of civil war in Syria 11 years ago – are now terrified of the current crackdown on their presence.  According to UNHCR spokesperson Paula Barrachina, there have been at least 73 confirmed raids on Syrian communities across the country in April.  Barrachina also confirmed to Al Jazeera – without providing a number – that Syrians had been detained and deported, including those registered with UNHCR.  “UNHCR takes reports of deportations of Syrian refugees very seriously and is concerned about current developments,” Barrachina told Al Jazeera.  The Lebanese interior ministry has not responded to Al Jazeera’s requests for comment.      Avoiding deportation  A senior humanitarian source, who was not authorised to speak publicly, told Al Jazeera that more than 1,100 Syrians have been arrested and 600 deported since the start of 2023.  Some of these deportations have left minors separated from their families.  Waad, 31, and her husband Raad – who asked for their last name to be withheld – fled to Lebanon from Deraa in southern Syria in 2006.  Their stay became legal in 2012 due to Raad gaining sponsorship through his employer, but this lasted only one year as he lost his job.  Now, amid the crackdown and deportations, Raad is struggling to get sponsorship from his new employer at a factory in Beirut.  “They need a photo of the company owner’s ID [to process the residency] but he is refusing to provide it. My husband is trying and trying but the owner isn’t helping,” Waad told Al Jazeera as her three young children noisily released their energy around her.  “Now my husband is afraid to go to his job at night because of anyone asking him for his papers,” she said, worried.  Her children are also in fear of going to school, and Waad explained that there are checkpoints set up down the road from the house in front of the only mosque in the neighbourhood, where security forces check paperwork.  “At the end of Friday prayers, they’re making a checkpoint so no one can escape it,” she explained.  Like al-Omari, Raad has avoided military service in Syria, and Waad says he is wanted. The whole family has also been vocal against the Syrian regime.  “If we were deported, he would be taken by the Syrian forces and I would never be able to see him again,” Waad said, referring to her husband.  Raad suffers from a condition that causes intense stabbing or electric shock-like pain due to a disorder of the nerves – for which he can no longer find medication in Lebanon.  “So, if the Syrian regime catches him, he won’t survive a minute when they torture him,” Waad said.  “Anyone who says there is peace in Syria knows nothing.”      Unprecedented raids  Deportations of Syrians, including registered refugees, have been documented in previous years; between May 2019 and December 2020, the Lebanese Directorate of General Security confirmed that the authorities had deported 6,002 Syrians.  As rights groups have investigated, on their return, Syrian refugees, including children, are subject to unlawful or arbitrary detention, torture, rape and sexual violence or enforced disappearance.  However, Human Rights Watch Lebanon researcher Ramzi Kaiss said the number of reported raids and the manner in which the current summary deportations are taking place is unprecedented.  “We have spoken to multiple individuals, all of whom are registered with UNHCR, who were deported [recently] without being afforded the opportunity to challenge their deportation or to contact a lawyer, their families or UNHCR,” Kaiss said.  “We are also seeing a rise in anti-refugee sentiment propagated by public officials and media outlets who have resorted, on multiple occasions, to misinformation and disinformation tactics to incite against refugees.”  If al-Omari is deported to Syria, he is likely to be taken to prison from the border immediately.  “I would get a sentence of at least a year and then I would be sent to the service, which is indefinite; I have no idea when I would be released,” he explained.  For al-Omari, joining the military is not an option – he says his father and brother lost their sanity after serving for 35 and 10 years, respectively.  “My father was an aircraft mechanic … when he said something, [the officers] didn’t like; they imprisoned him and tortured him until he lost his mind,” he said.  “They released him by tossing him on the street, completely insane and they didn’t even pay him the retirement pension from the armed service.”  Al-Omari explains that his brother went through a similar situation, leaving him now unable to find work or interact with people since being released in 2020 with severe psychological damage.  As of May, the interior ministry made proof of registration in Lebanon mandatory for Syrians leasing property, adding to the existing restrictions on movement, work and social gatherings.  Kaiss told Al Jazeera the government is “resorting to incitement against refugees and illegal measures such as the summary deportations”.  “These restrictions are discriminatory [and] appear to be designed as part of a strategy to create a coercive environment for refugees in Lebanon, forcing them to consider returning to Syria, despite the risks they might face,” Kaiss said.  Usually working as a content writer, copywriter and translator, al-Omari has no option of working in Lebanon under the labour restrictions – which mostly limit work for Syrians to labour-intensive fields such as agriculture.  But even if he works online, he cannot receive his salary as he is unable to open a bank account or even money transfer services.  It is precisely due to these restrictions, including the fear of not being able to pay for rent, that al-Omari has decided to smuggle himself back into Syria within the next couple of weeks.  “I will just hide there and figure something out. I fully believe it’s going to be much safer for me than hiding in Lebanon,” he said.  “There I can hide in one of my friend’s apartments, and I know I will be safe because [the regime] are not invading houses any more looking for people like they’re doing here in Lebanon.”  Al-Omari is trying to sell his guitar in order to pay for the smuggler’s fees.  He knows he is taking a risk, but al-Omari says his current situation is untenable, and that his time in Lebanon has turned him into an insecure, introverted person.  “I became very stand-offish, because everywhere I go, I feel so alienated and discriminated by everyone and my movement is limited to its fullest extent,” he said.  He wishes he could tell everyone in Lebanon that he is not their enemy and that he did not even want to leave his country in the first place.  “If you took all of that hard work that you’re putting into hating us, me and my people, into actually solving your own bullshit you would be doing much better than you are right now.”"

Infrasound airwaves are low-frequency sounds below the threshold of human hearing that can propagate long distances. They may be used to detect small mudflows at distances of 5 kilometers or more. The signals can identify approaching mudflows when they are still more than 20 minutes away.  Lahars are the most impactful of volcanic hazards. The 1985 eruption of Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia, for example, killed more than 20,000 people when large lahars reached the flat valleys where the city of Armero was located.  The recent research looked at signals from more than 20 small- to medium-sized lahars that occurred in 2022 at the active Fuego volcano in Guatemala, where regular lahars occur during the country’s rainy season.  The study is a collaborative effort by scientists at Boise State University, the Instituto Nacional de Sismología, Vulcanología, Meteorología e Hidrología in Guatemala, and Michigan Technological University, and is funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation.  “This study is exciting because it adds to our arsenal of tools for early warning of volcanic mudflows before they reach and potentially impact downstream communities,” said co-author and Boise State geologist Jeffrey Johnson. “Infrasound signal analysis appears to have special utility to identify the early movement of mudflows high up on a volcano as they begin to flow toward exposed populations. Early warning is key for mitigation of hazards.”  The research team was fortunate, said Johnson, to record several lahars and to observe one medium-sized event firsthand.  “Lahars are one of the most common volcanic hazards but still one of the most poorly understood,” said Eva Zanzerkia, a program director in NSF’s Division of Earth Sciences. “This project demonstrates that developing new infrasound tools can go a long way toward improving our understanding the dynamics of these mudflows and helping us manage the hazards.”"

Wildfires burning in Alberta are pushing smoke into western Washington while unseasonably warm temperatures in the Cascades are sending sediment down the Puyallup River and into Commencement Bay.  Wildfires  While Mount Rainier was out Wednesday it appeared to be on a smoke break. The Canadian fires are layering smoke in the 10,000-15,000-foot range, said National Weather Service meteorologist Maddie Kristell  The good news is that air pollution is remaining comparatively better at sea level. Winds coming in from the Pacific should soon send the smoke on its way.  “By Friday it should be scooting out of here,” Kristell said.  Milky waters  The Puyallup River was the color of chocolate milk Wednesday afternoon. As sediment was filtering out, various parts of Commencement Bay looked white, blue and green.  Last weekend’s record-breaking heat wave accelerated glacial and snow melt on Mount Rainier and raised river levels. Further to the south on the slopes of Mount St. Helens, runoff demolished a highway bridge and trapped several motorists. They were later airlifted to safety.  Paradise was reporting a balmy 66 degrees late Wednesday afternoon. The warm weather should stick around through Saturday on the mountain with highs in the mid-60s.

However, once they were settled, both openers began to up the ante and smashed the Punjab bowlers to all parts of the ground.

The discovery was made in the Barents Sea, about 70 miles (113km) south of Norway’s remote Bear Island.  Researchers were exploring the seabed when they spotted a gigantic crater that likely formed at the end of the last Ice Age, some 18,000 years ago.  Within the crater they found a submarine volcano, around 400m (1,310ft) underwater, which is spewing out mud and methane from deep below the Earth’s crust.  Sign up for our free Indy100 weekly newsletter  ""Exploring the seabed and discovering new methane seeps is like finding hidden treasures,"" said Stefan Buenz, of UiT The Arctic University of Norway, who co-led the expedition that unearthed the geological phenomenon.  ""Every time we go down to the seabed, we get the feeling that we have just begun to understand the great and incredible diversity of such systems,"" Buenz added in a statement translated from the original Norwegian.  The only other known mud volcano that exists in Norwegian waters, named the Håkon Mosby, was discovered in 1995. It lies at a depth of 1,250m (4,100ft) on the seabed south of Svalbard.  These peculiar volcanoes serve as direct windows into the Earth's interior since they erupt sediments and water from depths of several hundred metres to a number of kilometres underground.  They also offer clues about previous environments that have existed on Earth.  Understanding the evolution and composition of the liquids helps us understand their potential impact on the global methane budget and can inform what is happening on other planets, according to Professor Giuliana Panieri, expedition leader and principal researcher for the UiT project.  “Seeing an underwater eruption in real time reminds me how alive our planet is,” Panieri added.  The new discovery, which has been named the Borealis Mud Volcano, is most likely the result of a catastrophic, natural blowout that suddenly released massive methane shortly after the last Ice Age.  The crater in which it lies – which measures some 300m (985ft) across and 25m (82ft) – deep hosts a rich seabed life, which thrives on the steep flanks of the carbonate crusts that were formed thousands of years ago, the UiT notes.  This unique habitat includes sea anemones, sponges, carnivorous sponges, starfish, corals, sea spiders and crustaceans, as well as extensive brush land and bacterial mats.  ""During this expedition, we discovered that these blowout craters are unique refuges from human impacts, such as trawling for fragile marine animals such as corals and sponges,"" said participant and REV Ocean Science Director Alex Rogers.  Meanwhile Irena Violan, an Erasmus student at UiT gushed: “As a student who has only seen mud volcanoes on land, it was a fantastic experience to see one on the seabed. You could see the surprise, excitement and joy that spread throughout the team the very moment we saw it on screen.  “My first thought was, ‘I want to get down there and stick my arm in it!’  Have your say in our news democracy.

He provided no details of Wickremesinghe’s response.  Bandula Gunawardena, May 16, 2023 [Photo: Bandula Gunawardena Facebook]  Gunawardena was not talking about the vicious physical attack on anti-government protesters at the Galle Face Green on May 9, 2022 by pro-government thugs assembled at former Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapakse’s official residence.  He was referring to the retaliatory violence that erupted across Sri Lanka in protest against the thug attacks on the protesters. This led to the killing of one MP, and the torching of the homes of dozens of parliamentarians and hundreds of government supporters.  Gunawardena told the media that cabinet ministers wanted Wickremesinghe to ensure that there would be no repeat of last year’s retaliatory actions against MPs and government supporters, and to ensure their “human rights” are protected.  If Wickremesinghe establishes such a commission it will certainly recommend that harsh anti-terrorist laws be developed and used against anti-government protesters, workers and youth. Confronted with widespread opposition to its attack on democratic rights, the government was compelled last month to postpone parliamentary discussion on its new Anti-Terrorism Bill. New draconian laws, however, are on its agenda.  The cabinet’s discussions are part of an intensifying political campaign to denigrate and vilify Aragalaya, last year’s nationwide uprising that demanded the resignation of then President Gotabhaya Rajapakse and an end to his government’s intolerable social attacks on the masses.  Confronted with this mass movement, Rajapakse fled the country and then resigned. His regime collapsed and the politically discredited Wickremesinghe was anti-democratically installed as president by the parliament. This political manoeuvre was made possible because the trade unions, backed by the pseudo-left Frontline Socialist Party (FSP) and other political formations kept the mass working-class movement tied to the parliamentary framework, blocking any direct challenge to capitalist rule in Sri Lanka.  The Wickremesinghe regime is acutely nervous about the rising opposition of workers and the poor currently underway against its savage International Monetary Fund-dictated austerity program that has already thrown millions into poverty, unemployment and near-starvation.  Last week, the police secured prohibition orders from a Colombo magistrate blocking demonstrations in Galle Face Green or at the president’s official residence and the presidential secretariat, to mark the first anniversary of the May 9 assault on anti-government protesters.    Moreover, for three days, starting on Friday night, the government deployed thousands of fully armed police officers and soldiers in Colombo in a major security operation. Police and military intelligence officials claimed that they received information regarding a planned protest by the FSP-controlled Inter University Student Federation (IUSF).  Now a slanderous campaign is underway to demonize the uprising last year. Members of the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) are circulating the accusation that a “foreign hand” was behind last year’s mass movement that brought down Rajapakse.  SLPP MP Namal Rajapakse—the son of former Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapakse—told the media last week, “[M]ore information on the foreign mission behind ‘Aragalaya’ [mass struggle] would soon be revealed.”  This was a reference to Nine: The Hidden Story, a recent book by National Freedom Front leader and parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa. The “nine” is the period from May 9 to July 9, 2022 that led to Rajapakse’s downfall. Weerawansa was the minister of industries in Rajapakse’s government until he resigned in March last year.  Wimal Weerawansa promoting his book, Nine: The Hidden Story, in late April 2023. [Photo: Wimal Weerawansa Facebook]  A virulent Sinhala chauvinist, Weerawansa was a former leader of the communalist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) and a rabid supporter of the communalist war against the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.  Bitterly opposed to last year’s anti-government uprising, Weerawansa claims this movement was a product of the political machinations of the US Ambassador in Colombo, Julie Chung.  Weerawansa’s allegations are a political slander against the historically unprecedented island-wide mass movement that brought down the hated Rajapakse regime.    As the Socialist Equality Party has extensively documented, in 2015 the US was directly involved in the behind the scenes moves to oust President Mahinda Rajapakse over his close political and economic relations with China. The regime-change operation, which elevated Maithripala Sirisena into the presidency, was backed by former President Chandrika Kumaratunga, Wickremesinghe and other sections of the ruling elite, and layers of the upper-middle class.  By contrast, the mass movement that exploded last year against President Gotabhaya Rajapakse and his government, united millions of workers and the rural masses across ethnic lines with protests, demonstrations and powerful one-day general strikes on April 28 and May 6.  This terrified all sections of Sri Lanka’s ruling class and their imperialist masters. While the US ambassador at the time certainly engaged in discussions with the Colombo political establishment, neither she nor those that she spoke to controlled this mass movement.  Protesters gather in a street leading to the president’s official residence in Colombo, Sri Lanka, Saturday, July 9, 2022. [AP Photo/Amitha Thennakoon]  Thoroughly discredited government ministers and MPs, fearful of the eruption of another uprising on an even larger scale, are now stepping up their campaign of slanders and lies against last year’s mass protests.  Minister of Urban Development and Housing Prasanna Ranatunga told parliament last Thursday that the demonstrators were “vagabonds.” He ludicrously claimed that “protesters who were inside the tents [last year] did not even know how to [use] birth control and now the delivered infants are being abandoned in the streets and trains.”  SLPP MP Rohitha Abeygunawardena alleged, without a shred of evidence, “When someone raids a bank it’s an activist from the protest, when there’s a rape, that’s activist of the protest, when there’s a murder, an activist from the protest is involved.”  Amid this toxic political environment, government-backed goons recently assaulted social media activist Piyath Nikeshala, prominent in last year’s protests. He was hospitalised after the attack. The police were compelled to arrest Chandika Abhayaratne, the SLPP former deputy mayor of Kaduwela, and other thugs implicated in the attack.  Some sections of the ruling elite are nervous that this campaign of vilification and violence will backfire and trigger another eruption of political opposition.  A May 12 editorial in the Island said: “It may be easier to demonise Aragalaya than to tackle the causes thereof, but such action will not help prevent mass uprisings in the future.” The government, it advised, could step down, “allowing the people to elect a new government,” and “to vent their anger.”  The SEP warns the working class that the ruling party’s slanders against last year’s mass movement are preparation to crush the inevitable social explosion against Wickremesinghe’s IMF-dictated social attacks.  Denunciations of the Wickremesinghe regime by all the opposition parties—including the Samagi Jana Balawegaya, JVP and Tamil National Alliance—are cynical attempts to politically exploit mass anger. These parties all support IMF intervention and its austerity demands.  Last year the trade union bureaucrats, the pseudo-left parties and various middle-class formations—which now claim to be fighting the Wickremesinghe regime—diverted the working class into the political dead-end of appealing to these capitalist opposition parties.  Compelled to call strikes and demonstrations, the trade unions made sure these were limited and politically controlled. Declaring that “the protest is ‘non-political,’” they attempted to block the SEP and its fight for an independent working-class strategy and socialist perspective.  Behind the façade of “no-politics,” the unions promoted the perspective of the SJB and JVP for an interim capitalist government. In doing so they paved the way for Wickremesinghe to come to power and unleash the state against the protesters.  The SEP intervened in the mass uprising explaining that it was not enough to demand Rajapakse’s removal. He was only the ugly face of a corrupt and reactionary executive presidency and the capitalist system. The SEP fought to free the working class from the straitjacket of the unions and vigorously campaigned for the building of independent action committees.  The political experiences of the past year confirm the urgency of the SEP’s call for a Democratic and Socialist Congress of Workers and Rural Masses based on the representatives from independent action committees. This congress will provide the political and organisational framework for the working class to consolidate its forces, win the active support of the rural masses, and lay the foundations to establish its own rule through a workers’ and peasants’ government committed to restructuring society along socialist lines."

We’ll take you on a journey to discover the deepest lake in Oregon and all its breathtaking beauty. From exploring the scenic hiking trails surrounding the lake to discovering unique aquatic life, we’ve got everything covered. So come along and join us in uncovering the hidden gems of this natural wonder!  Deepest Lake in Oregon  Crater Lake is the deepest lake in Oregon ©Pung/Shutterstock.com  Oregon is known for its stunning natural beauty, and one of the state’s most remarkable wonders is Crater Lake. Located in south-central Oregon, Crater Lake holds the distinction of being the deepest in the state – and even one of the deepest in North America.  Formed more than 7,700 years ago during a massive volcanic eruption, Crater Lake has since become a popular tourist destination due to its crystal-clear blue waters and breathtaking vistas. The lake measures approximately six miles across at its widest point, with a maximum depth of 1,949 feet.  Despite being located in an area that receives significant snowfall each year (an average of 44 feet!), Crater Lake rarely freezes over completely due to its unique geothermal activity. Visitors can explore the park via hiking trails or scenic drives, taking in views that include Wizard Island (a cinder cone within the lake) and Phantom Ship (a rock formation resembling a ship).  Whether you’re an experienced hiker or simply seeking some awe-inspiring scenery on your vacation to Oregon, be sure to add Crater Lake to your itinerary. It’s truly a wonder worth discovering!  How Was Crater Lake Created?  Crater Lake, located in Oregon, is a unique natural wonder that draws visitors from all over the world. The lake is situated inside a caldera or volcanic basin and was formed as a result of the collapse of Mount Mazama about 7,700 years ago following an enormous eruption. This volcanic event caused the mountain to lose its peak and left behind a massive crater or depression, which would later be filled with water to form Crater Lake.  What makes this lake even more fascinating is that it is one of the clearest lakes in the world, owing to its unique origin story. Unlike most other lakes, which are fed by rivers or streams, Crater Lake gets almost all its water from snowfall. Due to this fact, there are no nutrients flowing into it which could cause algae blooms or murky waters.  The clarity of Crater Lake’s blue waters means that visitors can see up to depths greater than 100 feet below the surface on clear days making for some stunning photo opportunities. It also provides researchers with an unparalleled opportunity to study underwater geology and ecology, as they can easily observe what lies beneath without having their view obscured by sediment.  Overall, whether you’re interested in history or geology or just looking for somewhere beautiful to visit, Crater Lake should definitely be on your bucket list!  Crater Lake National Park  Crater Lake National Park is open year-round. ©Matthew Connolly/Shutterstock.com  Crater Lake National Park is a sprawling natural wonderland, encompassing an impressive 183,224 acres of majestic mountains, verdant peaks, and lush evergreen forests. The park’s diverse topography offers a multitude of habitats for a wide variety of wildlife species, making it the perfect destination for nature enthusiasts and outdoor adventurers alike. Visitors can explore the park year-round and take advantage of its stunning trails that stretch over 90 miles through dense forests with breathtaking views from 30 different overlooks.  Whether you’re an avid camper or fishing enthusiast, Crater Lake National Park has something to offer everyone.

Birdwatchers will delight in observing the plethora of bird species that call this park home, while winter sports enthusiasts can get their adrenaline fix by snowboarding or sledding down snowy slopes.  The beauty of Crater Lake National Park makes it not only an ideal place to connect with nature but also serves as an outstanding outdoor laboratory and classroom where visitors can learn about geology, ecology, and biology, among other sciences in action. With so much to see and do at this remarkable national treasure trove open all year round- don’t miss your chance to discover what makes it one-of-a-kind!  Wildlife Near Crater Lake  The wildlife living in Crater Lake National Park is diverse and abundant. Mammals, birds, insects, fish, amphibians, and reptiles can all be spotted in the area. Fish species are found inhabiting the streams, while amphibians can be seen in wetlands, ponds, and by the lake. Reptiles are located mainly on Wizard Island and in more arid habitats.  Golden-Mantled Ground Squirrel  A golden-mantled ground squirrel is a small, furry rodent that can be found in various parts of North America. These squirrels are known for their distinctive appearance, with golden stripes running down their backs and around their necks. They also have reddish-brown fur on their bodies and tails.  While they may look cute and harmless, these squirrels are actually quite adept at surviving in the wild. They are skilled climbers and spend much of their time scurrying up trees to escape predators or find food. They also hibernate during the winter months to conserve energy.  In Oregon, you can often spot these adorable creatures while visiting Crater Lake National Park – home to one of the deepest lakes in the world! Keep your eyes peeled as you explore this stunning natural wonder; you never know when a golden-mantled ground squirrel might cross your path.  Canada Jay  A Canada jay, also known as a gray jay or whiskey jack, is a bird species that can be found in the forests of North America. These birds are known for their friendly and curious nature, often approaching humans to beg for food. They have fluffy gray feathers with white markings on their forehead and throat, and they typically measure around 10 inches in length.  The Canada jay is an important part of the ecosystem in which it lives. It feeds on insects, small mammals, berries, and seeds, playing a crucial role in maintaining the balance of its environment. These birds are also known for caching food during fall months to prepare for winter when resources become scarce.  In many indigenous cultures across North America, the Canadia jay holds spiritual significance as a messenger between worlds due to its ability to fly between earth and sky effortlessly. Additionally, these birds have been used by hunters as decoys due to their friendly disposition towards humans.  If you plan on exploring Oregon’s deepest lake – Crater Lake National Park – keep your eyes peeled for these fascinating creatures!  Black Bear  Please drive slowly near Crater Lake to avoid hitting a black bear or elk. ©poppistock/Shutterstock.com  Black bears live in Crater Lake National Park, with 41 known individuals residing within its boundaries. Interestingly, females outnumber males in this population, although the reasons for this remain unclear. Male black bears typically have a larger home range than females, stretching up to 365 square miles beyond park boundaries. In contrast, female black bears tend to stick closer to their denning sites and usually occupy an area of no more than 27 square miles.  In terms of behavior and activity patterns, black bears in Crater Lake National Park tend to be most active between May and November when they are not hibernating. During the winter months from November through May, when food is scarcer and temperatures drop significantly lower at higher elevations where many of these animals reside, black bears retreat into dens or hollow trees until spring arrives again.  While seeing a bear during these five months when they are active is possible but it’s still unlikely as these creatures can be quite elusive even while out foraging for food. Visitors who do encounter a bear should exercise caution by keeping their distance and avoiding any actions that could provoke the animal, such as making loud noises or trying to feed them, which can lead to dangerous situations both for visitors themselves as well as the wildlife around them. Also, please watch your speed on roads to protect the wild animals that frequently crisscross them throughout the park.  American Marten  An American marten is a small, agile mammal that belongs to the weasel family. They are known for their sleek and smooth fur, which varies from dark brown to light tan in color. These animals are native to North America and can be found in various habitats such as forests, mountains, and even tundra regions.  American martens have sharp claws and teeth that help them climb trees with ease. They are skilled hunters who primarily feed on rodents but also consume birds, insects, fruits, and nuts. Although they generally hunt alone at night or during the early morning hours, they have been observed hunting cooperatively in groups.  In recent years, American martens have faced threats due to habitat loss caused by logging activities and wildfires. However, conservation efforts such as reintroduction programs have helped increase their population numbers in some areas.  Visitors of Crater Lake National Park may catch a glimpse of these elusive creatures while hiking through the park’s forests or backcountry trails. Seeing an American marten in its natural habitat is truly a unique experience that should not be missed!  Snowshoe Hare  Snowshoe Hares are experts at changing direction while running at top speed. ©Jukka Jantunen/Shutterstock.com  A snowshoe hare is a species of rabbit that can be found in many parts of North America, including Oregon. These hares are known for their distinctive oversized hind feet, which help them to move easily across deep snow – hence the name “snowshoe.” Their fur color changes depending on the season, with brown during summer and white during winter, allowing them to blend into their surroundings and avoid predators. Snowshoe hares are an important part of the ecosystem as they serve as prey for many carnivorous animals, such as cougars and coyotes. Despite being hunted by these predators, populations of snowshoe hares remain relatively stable due to their ability to reproduce quickly when conditions are favorable.  Up Next:"

After taking a nine-point lead into the half, the C's watched Miami quickly cut into the deficit in the third quarter. Before they knew it, the Heat had tallied a whopping 46 points in the frame. It was the only quarter Boston lost, but it was enough to propel Miami to a 123-116 win at TD Garden.  Celtics Talk POSTGAME POD: Catastrophic third quarter costs Celtics in Game 1 loss to Heat | Listen & Subscribe  As great as the Celtics have been all season, they have been prone to lapses like the one they had on Wednesday night. Marcus Smart didn't mince words about the team's inconsistency.  ""We get tired of doing the little things sometimes,"" the C's guard said after the Game 1 loss. ""I think that showed at times in our spacing. We have a lot of great players, but when we're all on top of each other, nobody can be great.  ""You've got a good defensive team like Miami, they'll make you pay for that. So we've got to make sure we do those little things and we can't get bored with those.

Given his history of holding onto timeouts, he'll likely face a fair amount of criticism for his inaction. Especially since the Heat squashed the Celtics' 7-0 run to start the fourth quarter after Erik Spoelstra's timeout.  But if you ask Smart, this one was on the players. Not Mazzulla.  ""Joe's real big on not bailing us out when we're playing like (expletive),"" Smart said. ""We've got to look at ourselves in the mirror. Joe can call a timeout and then what? We come out and do the same thing? So it's on us.  ""Joe and this coaching staff, they put in a lot of work to come up with a gameplan and put us in the right spots to succeed. But they're not out there playing. So we've got to come together and we've got to start helping each other out on both ends.""  Smart was a bright spot in the 123-116 defeat, dishing 10 assists in the first half to tie Rajon Rondo's franchise record for assists in one half of a playoff game. He finished with 13 points, 11 assists, and two steals.  But he and the Celtics will need to play a more complete Game 2 to avoid going down 2-0 in the series.

Generally, there has been a tendency to look at peace movements in two roles.  Firstly, there is a firefighting role of trying to bring peace when violence has already erupted. Secondly, there is a role of peace-makers which facilitates the negotiations of the authorities with various rebel or insurgent groups. Of course both roles are important in their own way and at various places and times have made important contributions to peace efforts.  However, to limit the peace movement to just these two roles would amount to a serious underestimation. The peace movement deserves and needs to have a much wider and continuing presence.  Even when things appear to be normal and there is no outbreak of any violence, the peace movement has the important role of resolving simmering tensions, divisions, hostilities and suspicions in society at various levels so that these can be reduced and resolved at an early stage without erupting in violence.  The peace movement also has to look at important development and livelihood issues, land and forest issues, how difficulties, problems, conflicts, misunderstandings and insecurities relating to these can lead to violence involving one group against the other or one or more groups against the state.  Such conflicts and suspicions can only be removed on the basis of a deep and comprehensive understanding of development and resource-based realities, in turn requiring a multi-disciplinary study and longer-term efforts.  All this is possible only with a continuing peace movement, known for its lack of bias as well as for its honesty and sincerity, which is well rooted in communities. Conditions should be created by the authorities and communities that such peace movements are able to function with a certain stability and continuity and in reasonably secure conditions as only then can they make their proper contribution.  This should be seen in the context of a wider need being felt for a stronger and wider peace movement with continuity in a world which is increasingly troubled by violence, wars, civil wars and a destructive arms race.  How can the peace movement become stronger to cope with the enormous challenges it faces? The sad reality is that today far too many people are paid to work full time for weapons and wars than for disarmament and peace – in fact the ratio of the latter to the former may be as low as one to one million. Most of those who can be seen to be working for peace may not be working in an unbiased way and hence can make only limited contributions. Those working with complete commitment to the idea of peace and non-violence are very few; further, those with the opportunity or the ability to link local with global issues are even fewer.  Thus we have the paradox of the most important objectives of peace having the least number of people working for them. Yet at another level the peace movement has the potential to be strong and broad-based. Its enormous potential exists in the basic reality that the overwhelming majority of people want to live in a more peaceful world and would like their children to inherit such a world. Somehow these yearnings of the world’s people have not been translated into reality.  It is a strong and continuing peace movement which can help to fill this gap. The challenge of the peace movement is to guide these worldwide yearnings of people in such ways as to make the world a much more peaceful and safer place, for now and for the future, for us and for our children. People in most parts of the world tend to be more affected by violence close to them, by violence in their daily life.  This may be in the form of domestic violence, gender-based violence, workplace violence, bullying, violence towards self, street violence or village or habitation or neighborhood level violence. Many good and wise people are already involved in trying to reduce this.  However, quite often they may not identify the deeper causes and contexts of this violence, thereby missing out on more effective remedial actions and the wider social response that is needed.  If a movement for peace and nonviolence can result in establishing inter-linkages and providing a wider social response to these various forms of violence, with emphasis on incorporating peace and non-violence as important social values to be integrated into society and education, all these forms of violence and their associated distress can be reduced in more effective and sustained ways.  In such a situation, many people who have experienced the great relief and joy of the reduction or removal of violence from their lives, as victims as well as perpetrators, would be motivated to become peace activists, taking this message of peace ad non-violence to others.  Hence the peace movement could get a very wide base, where commitment to peace is strengthened and the number of peace activists grows. The next logical step would be to link this strong base for reducing personal, inter-personal and local violence with the wider peace movement for non-violent national and international policies, for a future without wars and the arms race, for ridding the world of the huge threats associated with nuclear weapons and all weapons of mass destruction.  With a strong base of millions of people engaged in peace activities on a continuing basis, such a peace movement will be able to become a much more effective voice, particularly among the youth, and will be able to influence policy makers in more effective ways.  Another way of strengthening the peace movement would be to build stronger linkages with the various other movements for creating a better world, including the various movements for justice and equality, women’s movements and movements for environment protection. There are important meeting points for all these movements.  Thus in a situation like that of Manipur, for example, the peace movement would be strengthened greatly if it works in cooperation with movements for promoting sustainable livelihoods and protecting the livelihood base as well.  Again there would be much for the peace movement to gain from cooperation with the women’s movement as well, with its emphasis on checking all addictions and intoxicants.  However, such strengthening of the base for peace as well as for integration of various constructive efforts is not possible in a hurry, and this is why the need for a stronger peace movement working with continuity should be re-emphasized.

The Earth-like planet is the first such world to be discovered outside the solar system that offers some of the best evidence to date of volcanism outside the Solar System.  The planet orbits a small red dwarf star about 90 light-years away in the southern constellation Crater and is just slightly bigger than Earth, and if the planet is as geologically active as the research team suspects, it could maintain an atmosphere. Earth and Venus are the only planets in our solar system that are volcanically active. (Photo: AP)  advertisement  Nasa said that the planet, called LP 791-18 d, could undergo volcanic outbursts as often as Jupiter’s moon Io. The alien world was discovered in the data from Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and the retired Spitzer Space Telescope, further confirmed by ground-based observatories.  Also Read | India's Himalayan Telescope observes one of the most energetic objects in universe  Scientists said that the planet, the third detected orbiting this particular star, is likely covered with volcanoes. The planet's volcanism was not directly observed but rather inferred due to its significant gravitational interaction with the larger of the two other planets orbiting the dim star.  “LP 791-18 d is tidally locked, which means the same side constantly faces its star. The day side would probably be too hot for liquid water to exist on the surface. But the amount of volcanic activity we suspect occurs all over the planet could sustain an atmosphere, which may allow water to condense on the night side,” Bjorn Benneke, a co-author of the study said.  Also Read | New York City is sinking under its own weight  ""There is not yet any direct observational evidence of exoplanet volcanism, but this planet is a particularly likely candidate,"" said University of Kansas astronomy professor Ian Crossfield, one of the authors of the research published in the journal Nature.  The planet is located in the Milky Way about 86 light-years away from our solar system in the direction of the constellation Crater. A light year is the distance light travels in a year around 9.5 trillion km.  Its surface temperature appears to be slightly warmer than Earth's. It is situated on the inner edge of what is called the habitable zone, or Goldilocks zone, around the star - not too hot and not too cold, perhaps able to maintain liquid water on the surface and harbor life.

The two skeletons believed to be men at least 55 years old were found in the Casti Amanti, or House of Chaste Lovers, beneath a wall that collapsed before the area was covered in volcanic material. The area was likely undergoing reconstruction work at the time of the eruption in A.D. 79, following an earthquake a few days earlier.  “In recent years, we have realized there were violent, powerful seismic events that were happening at the time of the eruption,'' said Gabriel Zuchtriegel, director of the Pompeii Archaeological Park.  New archaeological techniques and methodology ""allow us to understand better the inferno that in two days completely destroyed the city of Pompeii, killing many inhabitants,'' he added, making it possible to determine the dynamic of deaths down to the final seconds.  More than 1,300 victims have been found in the archaeological site south of Naples over the past 250 years.  Photos: A closer look at a restored house in Pompeii"

Not technically a true geyser, this eruption of water is known as a “soda pop geyser,” because the cold-water eruptions look so similar to the popular Yellowstone phenomenon.  A geyser is created when pressure from hot steam shoots a tall column of water into the air, while soda pop geysers are created when a pocket of carbon dioxide mixes with the water until the water becomes oversaturated and then bursts the water out of the opening.  Crystal Geyser (in Grand County) is erupting!💦Our division geologist monitors this site & hasn’t seen an eruption in years, but this year’s wet winter might have caused the water table to rise, resulting in CO2 gas that powers the eruptions to push water through. #KnowYourH2O pic.twitter.com/hWgrORxT2w — Utah Division of Water Resources (@utahwaterres) May 15, 2023  According to the Utah Geological Survey, the Geyser was discovered in 1936 when an exploratory oil well, the Ruby No. 1 was drilled. Workers encountered carbon dioxide gas deep below the surface, approximately 360 feet, which was extremely pressurized.  The well was eventually abandoned, but in its aftermath, a geyser was created.  The November 1936 front page of Moab’s Times-Independent boasted of a new geyser that spouted an 80-foot column of water at regular intervals of about 15 minutes and a 150-foot column at intervals of about 9 hours.  Today, the geyser’s eruptions have slowed down, though it’s uncertain whether that’s a result of geological changes beneath the surface or of rocks that people used to drop down into the geyser.  Because the eruptions are sporadic, sometimes more than 24 hours apart, being able to see the geyser in action can be difficult.  Studies conducted on the geyser over the last 20 years have tracked the frequency and height of eruptions using sensors. The studies found that minor eruptions ranged in height from 2-10 feet, while major eruptions gained heights of 40 -80 feet and occurred on a schedule ranging from 17 to 27 hours apart. The duration of eruptions ranged from 3-49 minutes.  Related:  We want to hear from you. Have a story idea or tip? Send it to the KSL NewsRadio team here."

The landslide trapped 13 people and a dog who were at the observatory site; they were eventually safely evacuated by helicopter to safer ground. People have been visiting the volcano ahead of its 43rd anniversary of its explosive eruption.  According to the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), Route 504 will remain closed indefinitely due to the size of the slide and the instability of the hillside above the highway. The highway closed shortly after 9 p.m. Sunday, May 14, when debris from an adjacent hillside fell about 2,000 feet and covered the roadway with rock, mud, ice, and water causing catastrophic damage to the Spirit Lake Outlet Bridge. Engineers need to examine the hillside above the roadway and debris below to develop next steps.  “Additional safety analysis is needed, but due to the ongoing geological instability in the area, it’s too soon to tell when we’ll be able to safely do that work,” said Brad Clark, WSDOT Southwest Region Maintenance Manager. “We appreciate everyone’s patience during this emergency.”  Spirit Lake Memorial Highway is closed to all travelers at milepost 43 near the Science and Learning Center at Coldwater. The closure blocks access to Coldwater Lake and the Johnston Ridge Observatory as engineers work to assess the debris flow and ensure for public safety. There is no detour available. WSDOT strongly encourages visitors to not venture beyond the closure location due to the severity of the unstable hillside – the closure is in place for everyone’s safety.        WSDOT is working in coordination with the U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, and Skamania and Cowlitz counties in evaluating slope conditions. This work will help inform what steps are needed to stabilize the slope, cleanup, and rebuild the roadway and bridge.  The cause of the landslide is yet to be determined, though initial assessment is that unseasonably hot temperatures likely drastically melted snowpack which oversaturated soils and overfilled the channels of the slopes causing debris to join high water, which built up and then broke free, rolling downstream washing out the 85-foot bridge span and roadway.  In addition to cutting off visitor traffic to the Mount St. Helens area, USGS says power was cut off to the Johnston Ridge Observatory. “While the loss of power disrupted a major telemetry hub for Mount St. Helens monitoring, Pacific Northwest Seismic Network stations on the volcano are still providing plenty of data. There is no volcanic unrest associated with this debris flow,” USGS wrote in a Tweet describing the incident.        The debris flow involved in this incident is material left over from the 1980 debris avalanche and eruption of Mount St. Helens. The May 18, 1980 eruption remains the deadliest and most economically destructive volcanic event in U.S. history. Fifty-seven people were killed; 200 homes, 47 bridges, 15 miles of railways, and 185 miles of highway were destroyed. A massive debris avalanche, triggered by a magnitude 5.1 earthquake, caused a lateral eruption that reduced the elevation of the mountain’s summit from 9,677 ft down to 8,363 ft , leaving a 1 mile wide horseshoe-shaped crater.  As an explosive dacite volcano with a complex magmatic system, Mount St. Helens is expected to erupt again in the future. Nearby towns of Castle Rock, Olympia, Vancouver, and Yakima in Washington and Portland in Oregon are at risk from future eruptions. USGS describes the threat potential of Mount St. Helens “very high”."

Although the death toll from that catastrophe is unknown, between 16,000 and 20,000 people lived in the area.  This new discovery provides more precise details of the moments the eruption happened, because the inhabitants of Pompeii were not only killed by the lapilli, or small fragments of lava, the ash and the hot gases released by Vesuvius, but also by landslides from a major earthquake connected with the eruption.  Where was the couple found?  “Part of the south wall of the room collapsed, crushing one of the men whose raised arm offers a tragic image of his vain attempt to protect himself from the falling masonry. The conditions of the west wall demonstrate the tremendous force of the earthquakes that occurred at the same time as the eruption: the entire upper part detached and fell into the room, crushing and burying the other individual,” revealed the archaeologists who publicly exhibited the finding.  The couple, who were at least 55 years old, were found during the excavations of the House of Lovers undergoing work to improve the safety of the building, more specifically in a utility room where both had sought refuge and died from multiple traumas when parts of the building collapsed.  Two skeletons have been found in the ruins of Pompeii, the ancient Roman city wiped out by an eruption of volcano Mount Vesuvius nearly 2,000 years ago https://t.co/jqo1SLCouo pic.twitter.com/t9n1XIfhWZ — Reuters (@Reuters) May 17, 2023  The rest of the material discovered during the extraction  In an adjoining room, investigators found a stone kitchen counter covered in powdered lime, indicating that construction work was taking place nearby at the time of the eruption, according to several experts.  As if this were not enough, during the extraction of the cervical vertebrae and the skull of one of the two skeletons, remains of organic material emerged, probably a piece of cloth, in addition to five elements of glass paste identifiable as beads from a necklace and six coins.  The impact of the finding  Undoubtedly, this finding provides evidence increasingly clear that, during the eruption, landslides associated with the accumulation of lapilli or the impact of pyroplastic flows were not the only danger to the lives of the inhabitants of ancient Pompeii.  For the director of the archaeological area, Gabriel Zuchtriegel,“ modern excavation techniques help us better understand the hell that completely destroyed the city of Pompeii in two days, killing many inhabitants: children, women and men. With analysis and methodologies we can get closer to the last moments of his life.”  What happened in Pompeii?  In 79 AD, the ancient Roman city of Pompeii was devastated by a series of powerful earthquakes that preceded the catastrophic eruption of the volcano Vesuvius. This volcanic eruption completely engulfed the city and its population, amazingly preserving it for centuries and allowing contemporary archaeologists and scholars to reconstruct and fully understand life in ancient Rome.  With all this, it should be noted that Pompeii, for researchers, is an immense archaeological laboratory that has regained strength in recent years, “astonishing the world” with the constant discoveries revealed and demonstrating the Italian excellence in this sector."

Instead, new research suggests it was a series of eruptions or multiple vents spewing volcanic material in rapid succession.  According to the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) Yellowstone Volcano Observatory 2022 Annual Report (opens in new tab), published May 4, fieldwork over the past year has provided new geological evidence that ""the formation of Yellowstone Caldera was much more complex than previously thought."" A caldera is a large crater that forms after the collapse of a volcano following an eruption.  Yellowstone is one of the world's biggest volcanic systems. It sits above one of Earth's ""hotspots"" — areas in the mantle where hot plumes rise and form volcanoes on the crust above. It has produced three caldera-forming eruptions (opens in new tab) in the past 3 million years: the Huckleberry Ridge Tuff eruption, 2.1 million years ago; the Mesa Falls eruption, 1.3 million years ago; and the Lava Creek eruption, 631,000 years ago.  What are super-eruptions?  The Huckleberry Ridge Tuff and Lava Creek events are considered super-eruptions because they expelled over 240 cubic miles (1,000 cubic kilometers) of material. The latter was responsible for the formation of the Yellowstone caldera. Mesa Falls erupted 67 cubic m (280 cubic km) of material, so — while still about 10 times bigger than the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens — is not considered a super-eruption.  Related: Where are most of Earth's volcanoes?  Previous research (opens in new tab) has shown that the Lava Creek super-eruption was not out of the blue; deposits at the Sour Creek Dome region east of the national park suggest that the giant blast was preceded by at least one eruption. Ignimbrite (volcanic rock formed via the deposits of the hot mix of material ejected during an eruption) found at the site had completely cooled before the main, mapped Lava Creek eruption took place.  Researchers have found evidence that there were multiple explosive events during the last super-eruption at Yellowstone. (Image credit: Noppawat Tom Charoensinphon/Getty Images)  To better understand the timeline of the eruption, scientists spent 2022 remapping and collecting samples at Sour Creek Dome.  ""It had always been known that there were at least two geological units [a volume of rock distinct from those surrounding it] from the eruption, and it was thought that there was little to no time gap between them,"" Michael Poland (opens in new tab), scientist-in-charge at the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory, told Live Science in an email. ""Now, we think there are more units. And we're just not sure what the time gap might have been, if any.""  So far, the team has found four previously unrecognized ignimbrite units at Sour Creek, suggesting at least four eruptive pulses. They also found two structures that appear to be eruptive vents, which may have been the sources of these rocks.  ""That could mean either several vents were active and/or there was time separation between the eruptions,"" Poland said. ""But we don't yet have the data we need to answer those questions yet.""  In 2020, scientists found the Huckleberry Ridge Tuff eruption (opens in new tab) — which ejected more than twice the amount of volcanic material as Lava Creek did — was also a phased event. Analysis of rocks at the site suggests there were three separate eruptions, with weeks to months between the first two, and years to decades between the second and third.  Yellowstone volcano is not expected to erupt anytime soon . However, the finding that the Lava Creek eruption may have followed a similar pattern to that of the Huckleberry Ridge Tuff eruption could give an idea of what to expect if and when Yellowstone does blow. ""These major caldera-forming eruptions might not be single events at Yellowstone, but instead have multiple phases,"" Poland said.  Researchers at the volcano now plan to carry out detailed examinations of the newly discovered units and the boundaries between them. This will allow them to paint a more detailed picture of what the Lava Creek eruption looked like — and maybe even what triggered it."

Prior to the eruption, Mount St. Helens stood at 9,677 feet, says the website for the United States Geological Survey (USGS). It was the fifth-tallest mountain in the state of Washington.  ""It stood out handsomely, however, from surrounding hills because it rose thousands of feet above them and had a perennial cover of ice and snow,"" said the site.  ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, MAY 16, 1986, TOM CRUISE COLD WAR BLOCKBUSTER 'TOP GUN' JETS ACROSS SILVER SCREEN  That changed on May 18, when the volcano erupted for the first time in more than a century, says the USGS.  Once the dust literally and figuratively settled after the eruption, it was discovered that Mount St. Helens had lost roughly 1,300 feet from its cone.  Instead, there was a horseshoe-shaped crater in its place, says the USGS.  The crater's highest point, located on the southwestern side of the mountain, is 8,365 feet, said the website.  The eruption came almost exactly two months after seismic activity began on the long-dormant volcano, said USGS.  On March 16, 1980, a ""series of small earthquakes"" began to shake the area. Eleven days later, on March 27, following hundreds of small earthquakes, Mount St. Helens had a relatively small eruption — its first since 1857.  ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, MAY 15, 1800, PRESIDENT ADAMS MOVES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FROM PHILADELPHIA TO DC  In that eruption, ""steam explosions blasted a 60- to 75-m (200- to 250-ft) wide crater through the volcano's summit ice cap and covered the snow-clad southeast sector with dark ash,"" said the USGS.  These eruptions continued through April 22, said the USGS.  After about a two-week stop in volcanic activity, smaller eruptions and earthquakes continued from May 7 through the 17th.  ""By that time, more than 10,000 earthquakes had shaken the volcano and the north flank had grown outward about 140 m (450 ft) to form a prominent bulge,"" said the USGS.  This bulge was ""strong evidence that molten rock (magma) had risen high into the volcano,"" and was growing at a rate of up to five feet per day.  ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, AUGUST 25, 1916, NATIONAL PARK SERVICE CREATED UNDER PRESIDENT WILSON  At 8:32 a.m. on May 18, a 5.1 earthquake ""with no immediate precursors"" struck Mount Saint Helens, triggering ""a rapid series of events,"" said the USGS.  ""At the same time as the earthquake, the volcano's northern bulge and summit slid away as a huge landslide — the largest debris avalanche on Earth in recorded history,"" they said.  ""A small, dark, ash-rich eruption plume rose directly from the base of the debris avalanche scarp, and another from the summit crater rose to about 200 m (650 ft) high,"" they said.  The volume of the avalanche is the equivalent of one million Olympic-sized swimming pools, the USGS added.  Following the landslide, the destruction continued.  The landslide had removed part of the ""cryptodome,"" which was ""a very hot and highly pressurized body of magma,"" said the USGS.  With the cyptodome removed, Mount St. Helens's magmatic system depressurized, triggering ""powerful eruptions that blasted laterally through the sliding debris,"" knocking 1,000 feet off the height of the mountain.  AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL: 50 MUST-SEE LANDMARKS THAT TELL OUR NATIONAL STORY  The cloud of tephra, or rock fragments, reached 15 miles within 15 minutes, noted the USGS.  The aftermath of the initial eruption was devastating.  ""Virtually no trees remained of what was once a dense forest"" in the six-mile radius of the former summit, and other trees were knocked to the ground and seared, said the USGS.  ""The 600 km2 (230 mi2) devastated area was blanketed by a deposit of hot debris carried by the blast,"" the site said.  The eruption then became a ""Plinian eruption,"" defined as ""as one that produces a sustained convecting plume of pyroclasts and gas rising >25km above sea level,"" says the website Science Direct.  ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, MARCH 1, 1872, MAJESTIC YELLOWSTONE BECOMES AMERICA'S FIRST NATIONAL PARK  The Plinian eruption lasted for nine hours, sending 520 million tons of ash into the air.  The ash was so thick that the city of Spokane, Washington, located 250 miles from Mount Saint Helens, was plunged into complete darkness, said the USGS.  Over four inches of ash covered Yakima, Washington, reported Getty at the time.  ""Major ash falls occurred as far away as central Montana, and ash fell visibly as far eastward as the Great Plains of the Central United States, more than 1,500 km (930 mi) away,"" said the USGS.  ""The ash cloud spread across the U.S. in three days and circled the Earth in 15 days.""  ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, JAN. 28, 1986, SPACE SHUTTLE CHALLENGER EXPLODES, SHOCKING THE NATION  The blast also triggered something called a ""lahar,"" which is an ""Indonesian term that describes a hot or cold mixture of water and rock fragments that flows down the slopes of a volcano and typically enters a river valley,"" said the USGS.  In Mount Saint Helens' case, the snowy peak melted in the initial eruption.  That rush of water, combined with the rock flow, created a lahar.  In the weeks leading up to May 18, people who lived near Mount St. Helens were evacuated, according to an article in American Scientist.  The area immediately surrounding Mount St. Helens was divided into a ""red zone"" and a ""blue zone.""  Of the 57 people who died in the eruption, only one — Harry Randall Truman — did not have express permission to be near the mountain the day it erupted, and most of the deaths actually occurred outside the boundaries of the blue zone, said American Scientist.

HELENS, Wash. – It was 43 years ago on May 18, that Mount St. Helens exploded to life, erupting in violent fashion, spewing towering clouds carrying 520 million tons of ash that choked the skies with grit and darkness and claiming the lives of 57 people in what remains the largest volcanic eruption in American history.  While the most devastating acts occurred on that fateful day, scientists began getting an inkling something was up a little more than two months before the eruption.  For this year's anniversary, the U.S. Geological Survey poured back over its historical records leading up to the eruption, providing day-by-day updates on social media mimicking what happened 43 years ago each day before the mountain blew.  8 weeks before Mount St. Helens Eruption: March 20-23, 1980  Mount St. Helens had slept peacefully for 123 years while nestled in its spot in southwestern Washington along the Cascade Mountains; a tall, majestic snow-capped mountain that dotted the horizon in between sisters Mount Rainier, which sits closer to the Seattle area, and Mount Hood near Portland.  MOUNT ST. HELENS ERUPTION: SURVIVORS RECOUNT THE ‘DARKER THAN MIDNIGHT’ FURY IN 1980  The mountain only had 44 documented earthquakes between 1975 and early 1980. However, on the afternoon of March 20, 1980, the ground began to shake. Seismologists measured a 4.2 magnitude quake at a shallow depth.  Over the next three days, seismologists would measure dozens of quakes a day.  Seismologists raced to the mountain to install more seismometers around the volcano as another 4.2 quake rattled the mountain on March 22 and another greater than 4.0 struck on March 23. Scientists determined the quakes were not ""typical"" quakes with aftershocks, but many individual quakes, indicating a potential precursor to volcanic activity.  Frustration soon surfaced when seismologists returned to the mountain only to find their new portable seismic recorders are not working correctly due to bad batteries.  March 24-31, 1980: 'Bedlam' begins  On March 24, 1980, the USGS's David Johnston visited the Pacific Northwest Seismology Network's lab at the University of Washington in Seattle and finds ""bedlam"" as the quake count neared 500 per day while the mountain trembled every few minutes.  The quakes triggered avalanches on the snow-capped summits but otherwise were not causing any damage yet.  The first visible signs of a possible eruption came on March 27, when the first steam and ash explosion opened up a crater 200-250 feet wide and 80-100 feet deep, according to the USGS, That prompted evacuations within a 15-mile radius of the volcano and roadblocks to keep out the curious.  A dozen more bursts of ash continued into the 28th, each lasting minutes to hours.  ""It's like standing next to a dynamite keg with the fuse lit - only we don't know how long that fuse is,"" Johnston said at the time.  More steam and ash explosions continued into the 31st – one bringing ash to the town of Kelso about 35 miles away.  Still, the largest problem that day was keeping gawkers at a safe distance. The National Guard came in to help enforce roadblocks.  LANDSLIDE NEAR MOUNT ST. HELENS STRANDS DIVERS OVERNIGHT AFTER WASHING OUT ROADWAY  April 1-7, 1980: The mystery deepens  Larger quakes and more vigorous explosions marked the start of April, indicating an increased possibility of an eruption. However, USGS scientists at the time suggested it was more likely a series of small eruptions would occur instead of one large cataclysmic event.  The weather cleared enough again April 3, 1980, for scientists to fly over the summit and get a peek at the bulging mountain. Explosions sent plumes upward almost hourly, and winds carried ash east about 50 miles to the town of Glenwood.  Snow storms returned to the mountain on April 5, but scientists were still putting in 14-hour days to collect ash, measure gasses and install new equipment.  April 8-13: The waiting game ensues  By April 8, 1980, volcanologists noted what may be a ""new reality"" of a relatively stable pattern where melting snow ran into the crater and was blasted into steam by the bubbling hot volcanic cauldron.  The mountain occasionally belched some ash – on the 9th, the ash carried into the Puget Sound region, meaning just about every corner of Washington received ash at some point.  The rest of the week, the mountain settled into ""ho-hum"" steam and ash explosions. Attention waned and the media moved on to more pressing stories. With the constant monitoring also a constant drain on the USGS budget, some staff members returned to their regular jobs.  The 11th provided a fateful encounter as scientists went to check on local mountain resident Harry Truman who lived at a lodge along the mountain's Sprit Lake for 54 years. He swore that despite the danger, he would not leave. Truman did not live to see his 55th year at the lake, becoming one of the 57 people who perished in the eruption.  April 14-22: The media pokes the bear  April 14, 1980, marked nearly a month since the volcano had sprung to life, but a local newspaper chided Mount St. Helens for putting on a ""half-hearted"" show. Four days later, another paper panned the mountain for its ""listless performance."" One local TV station was brazen enough to send their helicopter to the summit to get footage of it.  ""The area is closed, but it's hard to enforce,"" the USGS wrote.  The volcano occasionally sent out steam plumes, and seismic activity remained ""moderate.""  April 23-28: New worries emerge  As the weather cleared once again, scientists sent choppers to get fresh aerial photography of the summit. A bulge was found on the north side that had moved some 300 feet up and out from where it was the previous year.  WATCH A VOLCANO MAKE ITS OWN WEATHER  Meanwhile, the quake count for the entire reawakening had reached 1,500.  A sensor placed at Goat Rocks about midway up the mountain's slope was found to have moved 3 yards to the north.  April 29-May 3: Getting ready in case the mountain blows  Concerns rose that there would be a massive avalanche on the bulging northern flank of the mountain, which would dump debris into Spirit Lake and instantly flood the North Fork of the Toutle River.  Toutle Lake School, some 26 miles downstream, started conducting volcano drills and practiced loading 511 students and 85 staff members onto school buses to head to higher ground.  Meanwhile, officials installed new gates to lock down access to the northern side of the mountain as scientists established a new monitoring site closer to the volcano, just 5.5 miles from the summit. The ""Coldwater II"" site was staffed 24/7 to enable constant monitoring.  May 3-6: St. Helens becomes ‘misshaphen, ash-tarnished rebel’  Other than measurements that the bulge near Goat Rocks was moving about 4-5 feet a day, the USGS said the volcano hadn't done anything to convince a non-scientist that a hazard existed. If not for news media reports highlighting how much the bulge was moving, the growing clamor to ease restrictions in the area would've grown louder.  ""Local residents growing weary of life near an active volcano,"" the USGS said. ""Like saint-turned-sinner, the mountain has gone from a calm, dependable friend that radiated beauty, to a misshapen, ash-tarnished rebel. Nobody knows what to expect next.""  May 7-11: Mount St. Helens reawakens  The volcano's two-week break came to an end as bursts of steam and ash reached 13,000 feet on May 7, 1980, while the bulge continued to move and quakes shook.  As the bulge continued to grow and move, scientists believed it was only a matter of time before the bugle failed and a massive mudslide ensued.  Meanwhile, officials kept pleading with Harry Truman to leave his Spirit Lake-front cabin.  May 12-17: The precursors to disaster  On May 12, 1980, a strong 5.0 quake shook loose an 800-foot-wide avalanche of ice and rock on the north side while ominously, the crater's high point stood 500 feet taller than it was two months earlier.  WHAT MAKES ‘PELE’S HAIR' DURING A VOLCANIC ERUPTION?  In the days after, the mountain goes quiet again. In a twist, scientists were baffled when a meeting with officials where it was assumed they would discuss expanding restricted areas instead turns into talks of which areas could reopen for Memorial Day weekend.  Cabin owners inside the restricted ""red zone"", who had been clamoring for access while threatened with $500 fines and 6 months in jail if they enter the restricted area, were finally granted access to visit their cabin on May 17. Cabin owners signed waivers and headed to their homes to pack up items before leaving by the end of the day.  USGS's David Johnston was the lone team member to stay at the Coldwater II monitoring site on the night of the 17th.  May 18: A quiet early morning then ‘Vancouver! Vancouver! This is it!’  A 7 a.m. check on the mountain from Johnston found nothing unusual. The 7:30 a.m. morning meeting was also mundane.  Then at 8:32 a.m.: ""Vancouver! Vancouver! This is it!"" radioed Johnston from the lookout point as the mountain violently erupted. Vancouver didn't hear the warning, but the message was heard and recorded by a ham radio operator.  A mad scramble ensued. Campers by the Green River reported hearing distant sounds, then blasted by winds as the skies turned pitch black and the ground vibrated. Trees blew over as mud and ice rained down. It was a cold blast at first, but soon everything began to burn and warm ash started to fall. The campers scrambled to walk out.  next Image 1 of 5  prev next Image 2 of 5  prev next Image 3 of 5  prev next Image 4 of 5  prev Image 5 of 5  Geologists from Spokane were on a helicopter ride near the crater moments before the blast and witnessed a mile-long fissure in the volcano as the eruption started. The pilot dove from the skies and managed to safely fly back to Portland.  Broadcasters scrambled to find out what was happening and get on the air. Loggers in the area heard screams about a volcano as trees jiggled and fell as they were knocked down by the wind. Massive mudflows from instantly-melted snow raced down mountains and flooded the nearby terrain under feet of water and mud, wiping out roads and bridges along the way. Day turned to night in communities in Eastern Washington as upper-level winds spread thick clouds of ash across the skies.  In the aftermath, the USGS sadly learned that Johnston did not survive the eruption, becoming one of the 57 people killed that day. An aerial tour of the devastation confirmed the Coldwater II lookout was destroyed. Johnston's legacy lives on both at the USGS and at the volcano.  The Coldwater II site was renamed the Johnston Ridge Observatory in his honor.  As mentioned earlier, Spirit Lake Lodge resident Harry Truman also lost his life when the mountain erupted.  So much more happened on that fateful day. The USGS is running a timed Twitter thread all day Thursday with minute-by-minute accounts of what happened on May 18, 1980, and beyond."

Third-seeded Aurora advanced Tuesday with a 4-0 triumph over ninth-seeded Youngstown Ursuline.  West Branch bowed out with an 11-11 record and won four of its last five games with a roster featuring just one senior.  “I thought overall we played well,” stated West Branch head coach Jennifer “Sis” Woods, the only softball coach in West Branch history who recently had the school’s softball field named in her honor. “We told them before we started that as long as you can walk off knowing you gave it your all, that’s all anybody can ask, and I really do think we did that.”  The No. 1-seeded Dukes advanced against West Branch by combining the strong pitching of senior Sofia Nase, who raised her record to 18-0 on the year, with a big fifth-inning at the plate. They batted around in the fifth and scored all five of their runs.  Nase, who has pitched 13 shutouts this season, including two no-hitters, was the winning pitcher, striking out 13 and walking five in a complete game.  “Today my screwball wasn’t on, but my rise ball was on,” commented Nase. “I feel like I’ve worked my velocity a lot in the offseason and it’s helped me a lot.”  More on Sofia Nase:Mind games: Marlington pitcher Sofia Nase's makes major strides in mental approach to game  “Sofia has been so good this year, she hasn’t given up more than three runs in any game all year,” said Tagliarini. “So I thought when we got it (the lead) to five it would give us a cushion and clearly that was needed.”  Before the Dukes’ offensive outburst, Nase and West Branch sophomore right-hander Klary McKay locked up in a pitchers’ battle which kept things at a 0-0 stalemate through four innings.  But all that changed for Marlington in the bottom of the fifth. The Dukes had seven hits in the game and five of them occurred in the fifth. The big blow offensively for Marlington occurred when junior Audrey Miller stepped to the plate and sent a pitch by McKay over the left field fence for a three-run home run.  “The first two I hit out there, but the wind kind of killed them and the center fielder made a great catch on the second one, but I just kept doing what I was doing,” said Miller of her three-run blast in her third time at the dish. “It (the home run) felt pretty good off the bat. It was an inside pitch and she (McKay) was attacking me inside all game, so I was kind of expecting it.""  “I thought she (Miller) had great at-bats,” observed Tagliarini. “The wind kind of kept two in or I think she would have had three home runs otherwise. She’s a big-time hitter and that’s what she does. Every game she drives the ball.”  The three-run homer occurred after the Dukes’ Grace Nase opened with a double down the left field line and Delaney Martz reached base on a West Branch throwing error.  Before the inning was over, Marlington tacked on two more runs after Maria Walder singled to center and Ashlyn Maurer had an RBI double to left, making it 4-0. The Dukes finished off their big inning when Faith Savage singled to center, scoring Maurer, upping the advantage to 5-0.  “I think everyone contributed, we batted around in that inning,” praised the Dukes’ head coach.  Nase said having a five-run cushion helped her relax in the circle.  “I was sitting there and I was like we’re OK right now, but having more runs helps me relax,” commented the Dukes’ pitching standout.  The score remained 5-0 until West Branch’s last at-bat in the top of the seventh when the Warriors answered with their own rally.  With one out, West Branch had three straight batters reach base on walks, including Nicole Stoffer, McKay and Mikalyn Fitts. Senior Baylee Waugaman then hit an RBI single to center, making it 5-1. The Warriors followed with RBI singles by Libbie Davis and Mati Hawk, cutting the deficit to 5-3. With the bases still loaded, Nase settled in and recorded a strikeout and got the Warriors’ last batter to line out to second base, securing the win for the Dukes.  “That’s what we talked about in my meeting (at the circle in the seventh inning),"" Tagliarini said. ""My message to the infield was, hey, nothing worthwhile in life is easy, so let’s just go out there and get what we have to get and move on.”  Marlington’s top offensive players in the game in addition to Miller were Maria Walder (double, single), Grace Nase (double), Ashlyn Maurer (RBI double), Faith Savage (RBI single) and Chyanne Knapp (double).  Nase said the Dukes’ long-range goal lies ahead.  “Our goal was to win the EBC, which we did, and now, hopefully, get past what we did my sophomore year in the regionals,” said the Dukes’ pitcher.  “We want to go as far as we can (in the tournament),” added Miller. “Now we’ll just get ready to go for the next one.”  West Branch had four hits Tuesday — Josie Milliken (single), Baylee Waugaman (RBI single), Libbie Davis (RBI single) and Mati Hawk (RBI single).  Woods, who led West Branch to a Division II state runner-up finish in 2018, feels the future is bright for her young team.  “This is something to build on, we won the sectional and played very well against the No. 1 seed (Marlington) which is 24-1 and we’re a .500 team so that shows the growth that they have made,” she said.  McKay went all seven innings in the circle for West Branch while striking out one and walking three.  Tagliarini quickly turned his attention to Thursday’s district final against Aurora.  “We played against them (Aurora) three times this winter and I didn’t pitch Sofia against them in any of those games, knowing that we could meet up,” said Tagliarini. “I’m pretty familiar with them.”"

The board unanimously OK’d a motion by Supervisor Hilda Solis to denounce “the devastation of the Zoot Suit Riots, recognize this as a dark chapter in Los Angeles County’s history and recommit to fighting against racial discrimination.”  Solis said the uprising began in the early 1940s, when “mobs of U.S. servicemen, law enforcement officers and civilians ambushed young Mexican Americans, African American and Filipino American men” across the county.  The attacks became focused on people wearing “zoot suits,” which had become popular among young men of color and made them targets of racism and discrimination, Solis said.  “This was especially true among Latino youths in California who were known as `pachucos’ for wearing zoot soots,” she said. “The white majority at the time often viewed them as gang members and delinquents.”  Solis said the zoot suiters were spuriously blamed for the 1942 death of Jose Gallardo Diaz near a swimming hole known as the “Sleepy Lagoon,” and nine young Latinos were convicted of second-degree murder in Diaz’ slaying.  “These arrests and convictions were seen as shams by the Mexican-American community, with the police exclusively targeting young Brown men as suspects,” according to Solis’ motion.  “On May 31, 1943, a group of servicemen and a group of Mexican American youth wearing zoot suits scuffled in downtown Los Angeles. Three days later, on June 3, 1943, another confrontation ensued, only this time servicemen were joined by police on orders to `clean up’ downtown Los Angeles. The next day, a group of over 200 Marines and sailors took a caravan of taxis into East Los Angeles and began to beat any young man wearing a zoot suit, burning their belongings in the process.”  The riots died down later that year when U.S. servicemen were banned from the area, and the City Council backed a resolution — that was never codified as a law — that barred zoot suits in the city.  The Zoot Suit Riots became a dark chapter in the history of the Chicano community, and were commemorated by a Broadway play in the 1970s that became a film starring Edward James Olmos in 1981.  Supervisor Holly Mitchell said the riots were indicative of a pattern of groups of people being targeted for their “clothes, culture and identity.”  “We’ve seen that repeated over and over in our history, where groups who attempt to express our cultural pride and identity through clothes, music, style, hair … whatever the case may be, how it’s frowned upon and quite frankly feared,” she said. “And the effort to erase and eliminate never seems to be successful.”  Mitchell noted that recognizing the Zoot Suit Riots is “particularly important now,” saying there are some politicians who are “attempting to rewrite American history.”  Supervisor Janice Hahn added, “Until we understand and come to grips with our past, even our shameful past, we are in jeopardy of repeating it.”"

Mirwaiz Farooq was shot dead in his house at Nigeen in Srinagar on May 21, 1990.  Special Director General of Police (CID) R.R. Swain told the media in Srinagar that the arrested militants included the one who entered the bedroom of Mirwaiz Farooq and fired at him.  The Nigeen police had filed an FIR, but the case was later transferred to CBI, Swain said. “The CBI arrested one of the accused and filed a chargesheet against him at a TADA court which awarded him a life sentence.”  The officer said the investigations into the case revealed that the plot to kill Mirwaiz was planned by Hizbul Mujahideen commander Abdullah Bangroo.  “Bangroo and his associate were killed in encounters while one accused was serving a life sentence,’’ he said. “Two other accused, Javaid Bhat and Zahoor Ahmed Bhat, both residents of Srinagar, were evading arrest and were hiding in Pakistan and Nepal. They have been arrested by the State Investigating Agency (SIA) and handed over to the CBI.”  Swain said Bhat was the one who had shot Mirwaiz in his bedroom .  He, however, didn’t reveal where the duo were arrested from.  The killing of Mirwaiz had sparked widespread anger in Kashmir and accentuated the political and security crisis due to the eruption of militancy. Several people were killed after security forces opened fire on a procession during the funeral of Mirwaiz.  After the killing of Mirwaiz, who was widely revered and respected in Kashmir and outside, the Centre removed then governor Jagmohan Malhotra due to worsening situation in Kashmir.  The Mirwaiz family is the custodian of Jama Masjid, the most important and historic mosque in Kashmir, which has remained mostly shut for congregational prayers after the removal of Article 370."

Dr. Mehul Dixit, a pediatric nephrologist (a children’s kidney and urinary tract specialist), was charged last week with two counts of sexual battery, and his medical license was suspended, according to police and a report issued by the Mississippi State Board of Medical Licensure. He was not charged in the alleged Florida incident.  Dixit, who is 59 and went to medical school in India, also appears to have practiced medicine in Arizona and New York City, available records show.  At Friday’s court hearing, a judge set Dixit’s bond at $300,000 and barred him from having contact with his accusers, anyone under age 18 or anyone he worked with at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson.  Dixit is not listed as an inmate at the Hinds County Jail. He lives in the Jackson suburb of Madison with his wife, who is also a physician, records show.  Dixit’s lawyer Cynthia Stewart Dixit did not immediately return a call requesting comment She did not comment about the allegations but told local media that Dixit has agreed to stop practicing medicine, WAPT-TV of Jackson reported.  The licensing board has summoned Dixit for a hearing Thursday, saying evidence indicated that allowing him to continue practicing “would constitute an immediate danger to public health and safety.”  The two Mississippi teens Dixit is accused of sexually abusing said he preyed on them during medical examinations at UMMC. One of the accusers told police she was 13 in 2013 when he allegedly abused her, according to the report. The other said she was 17 when Dixit allegedly assaulted her in February.  In its report Friday, the board noted that in 2016 a Florida woman came forward and told its investigators Dixit abused her during an examination a decade earlier for kidney stones. The circumstances under which the Mississippi teens are alleged to have been assaulted were similar to those the Florida woman described, the report says.  The woman, who was 17 at the time of the alleged assault, told a board investigator that Dixit ushered her mother out of the examination room, had her strip naked and then rubbed her breasts and touched her vagina while he was not wearing gloves.  The board report does not say what prompted the Florida woman to come forward. The agency did not return several calls seeking an explanation.  At the time, Dixit was working at UMMC in Jackson. And it appears no steps were taken in 2016 to limit his access to young female patients. The woman did not file a report with police.  “No further action was taken because the events had reportedly occurred in the State of Florida and fell within the primary jurisdiction of that State,” the report states.  The alleged Florida incident resurfaced after “a law enforcement officer contacted Board Investigative Staff” after the most recent allegation and “requested information related to Licensee’s prior interactions with the Board,” the report says."

The actor received the movie star treatment on the red carpet as some fans erupted in applause, tears, and shrieks, hoping to get his autograph and pose for photos together. ""We love Johnny"" and ""Congrats Johnny"" signs could be seen from the crowds, standing in stark contrast to the brewing backlash overseas and online amid controversy surrounding Depp after the 6-week trial.  CANNES, FRANCE - MAY 16: Johnny Depp arrives for the ""Jeanne du Barry"" Screening & opening ceremony red carpet at the 76th annual Cannes film festival at Palais des Festivals on May 16, 2023 in Cannes, France. (Photo by Andreas Rentz/Getty Images)  Andreas Rentz/Getty Johnny Depp at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival  The historical romance from Maïwenn Le Besco, known mononymously as Maïwenn, stars Depp as Louis XV and marks the actor's first leading role following his ongoing legal battles. Last summer, Depp won his defamation lawsuit against Heard after a jury decided that Heard intentionally and maliciously defamed the actor when she penned her 2018 Washington Post op-ed about about her experiences as a domestic abuse survivor.  The verdict came after Depp lost a libel lawsuit against The Sun in 2020, centered on the newspaper's use of the word ""wife beater"" in a piece on Heard's allegations against Depp. A judge ruled the article was ""substantially true"" and that ""the great majority of alleged assaults of Ms. Heard by Mr. Depp have been proved to the civil standard."" Depp has continued to deny the allegations.  Amid the fanfare on the red carpet, Heard's supporters launched a social media campaign with the hashtag #CannesYouNot and slammed the festival for ""celebrating abusers for 76 years."" (French actress Adèle Haenel also accused Cannes and the French film industry of ""complacency toward sexual aggressors,"" citing controversial filmmakers Roman Polanski and Christophe Ruggia, the latter of whom Haenel accused of sexual harassment.)  Story continues  Festival chief Thierry Fremaux dismissed the backlash during a press conference on Monday, calling Haenel's ""radical"" comments ""false"" and defending Depp's inclusion. ""I don't know about the image of Johnny Depp in the U.S.,"" Fremaux said. ""To tell you the truth, in my life, I only have one rule, it's the freedom of thinking, and the freedom of speech and acting within a legal framework.""  He added of the Depp v. Heard trial: ""I'm the last person to be able to discuss all this. If there's one person in this world who didn't find the least interest in this very publicized trial, it's me. I don't know what it's about. I also care about Johnny Depp as an actor."" It signals the country's ongoing support for the star, who recently signed a $20 million+ deal with French luxury house Dior, marking the company's biggest men's fragrance contract.  Jeanne du Barry Johnny Depp  Why Not Productions. Johnny Depp in 'Jeanne du Barry'  During the festival's opening press conference, Cannes juror and #TimesUp advocate Brie Larson also fielded a reporter's question about Depp's inclusion: ""You're asking me that? Um, I'm sorry, I don't understand the correlation of why me specifically,"" Larson said, adding of whether she'll see his movie, ""I'll see it when I see it. I don't know how I feel about it frankly.""  Maïwenn has also courted controversy. The director, who also stars opposite Depp in Jeanne du Barry as the titular mistress, recently admitted to spitting in the face of journalist Edwy Plenel, the founder of outlet Mediapart, which reported about several women who accused Maïwenn's ex-husband, the director Luc Besson, of rape. ""Do I confirm that I assaulted him?"" Maïwenn said during a talk show appearance on Quotidien. ""Yes.""  ""I'll speak about it when I'm ready,"" she added. ""I'm very anxious about the release of my film."" Plenel — who said Maïwenn approached him at a restaurant, tilted his head back, and spit in his face — slammed Maïwenn as ""outspokenly anti-#MeToo"" in an interview with Variety. ""This aggression caused more stupor than anything else,"" Plenel said. ""She didn't attack just me individually, but the symbol that I represent, as the founder and director of a journal, which in France has been at the forefront of all the #MeToo revelations.""  Jeanne du Barry Johnny Depp  Stéphanie Branchu/Why Not Productions. Johnny Depp in 'Jeanne du Barry'  Reception to the French-language film at the opening night screening was a bit removed from the fanfare Depp was welcomed with outside. The actor received far less applause on sight as he arrived inside the theater. After the film's conclusion, someone in the back of the Debussy theater where press was seated yelled out, ""Give him an Oscar!"" which was followed by a few chuckles. The ovation was observed as short by Cannes standards, with Maiwen seeming to earn more of the audience's praise.  Reviews posted afterward echoed the more tepid response observed at the screening. Variety critic Peter Debruge said Depp ""seems strangely uncomfortable in the role — adequate but not especially engaged.""  ""His French is not too shabby, but his regal gravitas is nonexistent, and he only truly looks at home in the role during occasional bouts of clowning, which hardly help sell his casting as an inspired choice,"" wrote The Telegraph critic Robbie Collin, ""It would be a stretch to say this feels like the first spark of a glorious comeback.""  Jeanne Du Barry is playing in theaters in France now, while its U.S. release plan is not yet announced.  With additional reporting by Carita Rizzo and Wendy Naugle.  Want more movie news?

The seventh installment, touched by the tragic loss of Paul Walker, garnered a staggering 2.43 billion yuan, while the subsequent film exceeded that with 2.67 billion yuan. However, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic's impact and mixed reviews, ""F9"" achieved 1.39 billion yuan in China. Now, the race is on to see if ""Fast X"" can outpace its predecessors at the box office."

Awareness generation regarding this disease is very important. For that, National Dengue Day is observed on 16 May and the month of July is observed as Anti-Dengue Month in India. This dengue prevention campaign aims to sensitise and mobilise community to take immediate action to reduce eruption of dengue cases by highlighting the health consequences of dengue and areas that are at higher risk.  The theme of this 8th National Dengue Day is ‘Harness partnership to defeat dengue’. In 2012, epidemiological studies of India indicated that Tirunelveli in Tamil Nadu was the epicentre of the dengue epidemic. Since then, Arunachal Pradesh is experiencing its epicentre in Pasighat township. During Covid-19 period, least cases were recorded, may be due to almost restricted movement of community/infected carrier or sufferer/fever screening of outsiders at entry gate of district/state.  During 2022, imported cases were detected in our state capital that arrived here from Uganda and some other parts of our country like Bangaluru, Mumbai, etc. A small outbreak was also reported in East Kameng in the end part of the year (post monsoon).  Once in a densely populated colony in Pasighat, people were facing shortage of water as the lone hand pump in the colony was drawing poor quality water (that pump was marked red and put under lock and chain). The residents of the locality then began to store water in different small and large pots without proper cover for long periods of time. There was also a tyre shop nearby the same colony, wherein old and used tyres collected rainwater for days. All these led to the spread of dengue in that area.  Dengue is an endemic disease and one of the major public health problems in India. During the last five years, the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP), now renamed NCVBDC, reported approximately 80,725 cases of dengue per year with a fatality rate of about 0.24 percent in India. According to the WHO, dengue affects approximately 100-400 million people every year. As per a scientific estimation, the global burden of dengue has increased at least fourfold over the last three decades and 2.5 billion people are now at risk of the disease. An estimated 99 million (95 percent credible interval 71-137 million) symptomatic dengue infections and 404 million asymptomatic (95 percent credible interval 304-537 million) infections occur annually in over 100 countries, with 5,00,?000 cases of severe dengue and 20,?000 deaths. There is an estimated 9 billion dollar direct and indirect medical cost of dengue in the world.  Dengue virus strains are of four distinct serotypes – DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3 and DEN-4. Each of them has multiple genotypes. The genotype variation can be subtle either in DNA material or the envelope. For example, DENV-1 comes in as many as five genotypes – Asia, South Pacific, Thailand, Malaysia and AM/AF. Type I causes classic dengue fever, Type II leads to haemorrhagic fever with shock, Dengue III causes fever without shock, and Dengue IV causes fever without shock or profound shock. Mixed serotype may be dangerous.  Dengue is a viral fever which transmits to humans after the bite of an infected female mosquito of the species Aedes aegypti/Aedes albopictus with a habit of day biting. The incubation period of dengue is usually from 4 to 10 days. Dengue virus (of Flaviviridae family) infections can manifest as a wide clinical spectrum of disease, ranging from ‘dengue fever’ (a self limiting mild febrile illness) to ‘severe dengue’ (dengue hemorrhagic fever, which is characterised by capillary leakage leading to hypovolaemic shock, organ impairment and bleeding complications). However, most infections remain asymptomatic or cause a relatively mild systemic illness. A few studies suggest that maternal dengue infection (materno-fetal transmission, congenital dengue viral infection) during pregnancy might increase the risk of preterm birth and low birth-weight. Neonates with congenital dengue have had clinical manifestations ranging from fever with thrombocytopenia to pleural effusions, severe haemorrhage and shock.  The clinical management relies on judicious fluid replacement of the severe cases and management of the symptoms through mild pain killers and anti-inflammatory drugs. But advice of a qualified doctor is must. Though some dengue vaccines are entering Phase III clinical trials, but none is available commercially at this time to be used by community.  Currently, there is neither any specific cure by any medicine nor any vaccine available for dengue. So, to minimise the risk of its transmission, the prevention and control of dengue is must. The strategy of its prevention and control rotates around the locus of vector control. (While doing this, it also reduces the transmission of Zika and Chikungunya.) Line departments need to work together for it and community should participate.  From public health point of view, higher dengue risk locations are about three to ten times more likely to develop into large dengue clusters, compared to areas with lower mosquito populations of Aedes aegypti.  The National Environment Agency of Singapore, promoting the concept of ‘B-L-O-C-K’ steps for control of Dengue: Break up hardened soil/Lift and empty flowerpot plates/Overturn pails and wipe their rims/Change water in vases/Keep roof gutters clear and place Bti insecticide inside.  Eleven controlling steps  Based on earlier experience, persistently high Aedes aegypti mosquito population, number of dengue cases and active dengue clusters to be detected before traditional peak dengue season (from June to October) comes.  We need intensive and concerted cohesive community effort to search for and remove stagnant water over a 14-day period, starting from pre-monsoon. The effort will cover two mosquito breeding cycles in frequent interval, helping to reduce the mosquito population/risk of dengue. Need to educate community on common mosquito breeding habitats, ground outreach effort to conduct house visits at dengue cluster areas and areas with high Aedes aegypti mosquito population (with technical input from right authority and lined departments), share dengue prevention skills and thus sustain a high level of awareness and source reduction of mosquito breeding spots to be carried out.  Weekly once compulsory removal of accumulated water from coolers and other small containers (plastic containers, buckets, used automobile tyres, water coolers, AC equipments of home etc, pet watering containers and flower vases). Need to continue checks at construction sites, and other uncovered mosquito breeding habitats like raw rubber latex collection bowl of rubber plantation, uncovered water tank of buildings.  Water storage containers should be covered with lids at all times. Wear full sleeve clothes, covering their skin in the transmission (rainy) season. Use a mosquito net or mosquito repellent while sleeping during the day. Use aerosol during the day to prevent yourself from mosquito bites.  Scientific entomological study  Modern technology of smart mobile phone provides scope through innovative app to set alerts on areas with dengue clusters and high Aedes aegypti mosquito population. Community can easily receive these push notifications if they pre-set the location on such app.  Genetically engineered mosquitoes  Next generation of infected mosquito of dengue can spread dengue as all larvae of such infected mosquito carries germs of dengue. To break this chain, during 2021, with a view to suppressing populations of wild Aedes aegypti mosquitoes (which can carry diseases like zika, dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever) genetically engineered mosquitoes (working on Endosymbiont principle) were released into the environment/air in Florida Keys of the United States. The small-scale field trials of genetically engineered cross-bred carrying Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are already performed in Australia, Brazil, Columbia, Indonesia and Vietnam, whereas large-scale field trials (citywide) performed in Yogyakarta city (Indonesia), Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) and Medellín (Colombia). Success was in a range of 70 percednt-95 percent. ICMR-VCRC (Puducherry, India) is also working on it, but it has to go through some procedures like regulatory approval that takes time regarding screening the biosafety of such technology, etc. It may bring success against chikungunya and zika virus also.  For future study, the genome sequence of the virus collected from the samples to be compared against the GenBank library which hosts all known dengue virus samples since 1943 to present time.

While it's a mid-season patch and won't introduce a new raid, it brings plenty of notable changes, including a third evoker specialisation, a new mega-dungeon, and the option to take dragonriding to the rest of Azeroth (opens in new tab).  Other quality-of-life changes are coming too, the biggest of which is that characters will automatically learn the riding skill as they level, meaning you'll no longer have to fork out a load of gold to take to the skies. To find out more about the WoW 10.1.5 update, here's what we know.  (Image credit: Blizzard)  No release date has been confirmed for the 10.1.5 patch beyond the fact that it is expected to land this summer. It arrived on the PTR (public test realm) on May 11, and if historical timings are anything to go by, we should expect to see the patch arrive in July 2023.  I'll update this section the minute a release date is announced.  Augmentation evoker  (Image credit: Blizzard)  Evokers get a third specialisation  The new Augmentation specialisation is a DPS spec with the added benefit of enhancing your group's overall performance. Some skills might improve allies' damage, while others might increase health or armor.  The Augmentation evoker uses the power from both the Black and the Bronze dragonflight. Black dragonflight magic focuses on raw power increases and forceful outbursts of earthen might. Bronze dragonflight magic is all about bending time, changing fate, and shifting timelines to tremendous effect.  Here are some examples of the skills you'd expect to use:  Ebon Might: Increase your four nearest allies’ primary stat by a percentage of your own, and cause your Eruption to deal more damage for 10 seconds. Some of your other spells extend the duration of these effects.  Eruption: Cause a violent eruption beneath an enemy’s feet, dealing Volcanic damage split between them and nearby enemies. Increases the duration of your active Ebon Might effects.  Upheaval: Gather earthen power beneath your enemy’s feet and send them hurtling upwards, dealing Volcanic damage to them and nearby enemies. Empowering expands the area of effect. Increases the duration of your active Ebon Might effects.  Breath of Eons: Fly to the targeted location, exposing Temporal Wounds on enemies in your path for 10 seconds. Temporal Wounds accumulate a portion of damage dealt by your allies, and then critically strike the enemy for that amount at the end of the duration. Increases the duration of your active Ebon Might effects.  Mega-dungeon  (Image credit: Blizzard)  Dawn of the Infinite is the new mythic-only dungeon  Dawn of the Infinite will be the new mythic-only, eight-boss dungeon to arrive in Dragonflight. According to Blizzard, ""This eight-boss Mythic-only mega-dungeon will take players across the timeways to stop the Infinite Dragonflight from succeeding. You’ll face Iridikron, among others, as you work to sustain Azeroth’s timeline and put things to rights once more"".  Mythic-only mega-dungeons have become a staple of mid-expansion patches since Legion, when the revamped Karazhan made an appearance. This was followed by Operation Mechagon in Battle for Azeroth, and Tazavesh, the Veiled Market in Shadowlands.  Warlock changes  (Image credit: Blizzard)  Changes coming to the warlock class  If you play Warlock, you can pick from any of the races (aside from Drackthyr) in the 10.1.5 patch. Currently, warlocks are restricted to a handful of races, but in the Fractures in Time update, warlocks can be any of the following races:  Tauren  Highmountain tauren  Mag'har orcs  Zandalari trolls  Pandaren  Night elves  Draenei  Lightforged draenei  Kul-Tiran  Additionally, you'll be able to customise how your imp pet looks at the barber shop, though you'll need to complete a quest to unlock the option.  Dragonriding  (Image credit: Blizzard)  You can choose how you fly in the rest of Azeroth (and beyond)  Dragonriding is arguably one of the best new systems to come out of World of Warcraft in a long time, and since its introduction at the launch of Dragonflight, many players have been asking for it to be extended to older WoW zones.  That's finally happening in Fractures in Time, and you'll be able to use your dragonriding mounts in any of the zones that currently allow flying. It also seems that some older mounts will also be able to use the dragonriding flying type, and you'll be able to choose the type of flying you'd prefer to use in the wider world.  Riding/flying skill  (Image credit: Blizzard)  You will learn riding and flying skills automatically  Once you reach the appropriate levels, you'll automatically learn the riding skill without seeking out a Riding Trainer or paying gold for the privilege. Right now, you learn four different riding skills while leveling:  Level 10: Apprentice Riding  Apprentice Riding Level 20: Journeyman Riding  Journeyman Riding Level 30: Expert Riding  Expert Riding Level 40: Master Riding  Apprentice Riding and Expert Riding teach you ground mount riding and flying, respectively, while the other two increase the overall speed you can travel at.  Instead of having to stop what you're doing and make the trek to your faction's capital city to buy the riding skill at the levels listed above, these will be automatically applied to your character at no additional cost. Additionally, you can pick up a quest at level 30 which will reward you with a flying mount on completion.  Other changes  (Image credit: Activision Blizzard)  Allied races will unlock automatically  Allied races will automatically unlock at level 40, and you'll no longer need to do any questlines or complete any achievements to access them. There are five allied races for each faction which start at level 10, which, apart from anything else, takes a good chunk of time off leveling if you fancy playing an alt or two.  Old hearthstones will become toys  The Garrison hearthstone from Warlords of Draenor and the Dalaran hearthstone from Legion have been part of your bag space for so long, you probably don't pay that much attention to them. In Fractures in Time, you'll be able to give them even less attention as they will both become toys, freeing up two spaces but still giving you the means to teleport quickly to those old locations.  You probably still won't have enough bag space, but at least it's a couple of extra slots to fill up with junk."

Equities halted the recent trading lull, with gains in the S&P 500 topping 1% and the Nasdaq 100 hitting the highest since August. Treasuries dropped, with yields on 10-year notes approaching 3.6%. President Joe Biden expressed confidence there will be no default, and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said reaching an agreement this week is “doable.”  “We don’t want to get too excited as the two sides reportedly remain far apart,” said Win Thin, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman. “However, we get the sense that there is a real effort to avert a debt ceiling catastrophe as the X-date of June 1 is fast approaching. Stay tuned.”  Read: RBC Sees Misleading Calm in ‘Paddling Duck Market’: Surveillance  JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s chief Jamie Dimon said the US government “probably” will not default on its debts. He joined other top executives of major banks in a meeting with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to discuss the debt limit.  The Treasury’s cash balance rose to $94.6 billion as of May 16, according to data published Wednesday. That’s up from from $87 billion a day earlier and compares with $140 billion at the end of last week. The Treasury’s bank account has been under downward pressure recently because of measures being taken to avoid breaching the $31.4 trillion debt cap.  “We all know the US Treasury is about to run out of ways to pay its bills, but we have seen this movie too many times before,” said Chun Wang at Leuthold Group. “While, theoretically, there is a threat of default, we certainly don’t recommend planning our lives around it. The script is very predictable: political posturing and grandstanding will go on until the 11th hour, and then a deal will be hastily put together to avoid a default.”  ‘Uncomfortably Similar’  If history is any guide, the debt-ceiling turmoil tends to be short-lived, without much impact on stocks before or after a resolution, Wang added. However, the August 2011 instance caught many investors by surprise, with equities slumping for a week or so before stabilizing. Assuming the date of resolution is June 1, the current pattern is “uncomfortably similar to August 2011,” he noted.  To Amy Wu Silverman at RBC Capital Markets, while markets are betting on a rocky end to the debt-ceiling debate, if they are wrong, investors may miss out on the gains.  “The tale of optimism does not exist,” she told Bloomberg Television. “Is there a possibility of a congressional miracle? If it at all comes in a little bit easier than we expect, that right tail is very cheap.”  Also helping sentiment Wednesday was a rally in regional banks after Western Alliance Bancorp reported growth in deposits, easing worries about the health of the industry.  In late trading, Cisco Systems Inc. dropped after the networking company reported its third-quarter results and gave an outlook.

State prosecutors appealed an earlier decision by the trial judge to toss the charges against the two defendants: bar owner Joseph Sullivan and Springfield Police Officer Derrick Gentry-Mitchell. In a relatively unusual move, the high court removed the matter from a lower appellate court and decided to tackle the legal issues themselves.  Hampden Superior Court Judge Mark D. Mason reasoned that because the charge of misleading described multiple acts, a grand jury may not have heard the precise evidence prosecutors brought against the two defendants first and glossed over critical details.  But in a 25-page opinion written by Associate Justice Dalila Argaez Wendlandt, the state’s highest court disagreed and restored indictments against the two minor players in the long-running Nathan Bill’s bar fight prosecution.  “Although each misleading statement could form a separate charge for misleading investigators, the Commonwealth is not precluded ... from proceeding under one indictment, charging the essential crime of willfully misleading investigators to cover up the off-duty (Springfield Police Department) officers’ role in the assault on the victims on April 2015,” Wendlandt wrote.  Prosecutors have said a street fight erupted outside the bar among rookie off-duty police and four Black patrons, and a department cover-up ensued to keep the incident from their superiors and the public eye. Sixteen were indicted over the matter in 2019.  Lawyers for the defendants have argued the fight occurred in a parking lot near the East Forest Park bar after a verbal dispute inside the pub earlier. They contend the civilians were the aggressors and the off-duty police and their allies were merely defending themselves. Five police officers have been tried for assault, with only two convictions for misdemeanor assault while others have been tried for the alleged cover-up with mixed results.  The whole affair has been a protracted black eye for the Springfield Police Department.  Gentry-Mitchell is accused of lying to his superiors, the FBI and the grand jury about whether he saw any of his colleagues there at the scene that night. He has been suspended from the payroll since his indictment four years ago.  Sullivan is accused of lying to the FBI and the grand jury about who he saw in the establishment and about calling a cab to usher the civilians away at the first signs of trouble.  They have denied the charges at their arraignments.  The high court remanded the indictments back down to the lower court to get the case back on track, according to the ruling."

Choose your plan ArrowRight The Senate voted to override the veto in a 30-to-20 vote Tuesday afternoon with the House swiftly following suit in a 72-to-48 vote. Shouts of “shame, shame” erupted on the House floor after the chamber, with its new GOP supermajority, approved the override.  The bills both significantly narrow the window for legal abortions but stop short of more restrictive bans that have taken effect across the South and Midwest since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade — the result of a push from moderate Republicans who feared political backlash.  On May 16, the North Carolina legislature banned most abortions after 12 weeks, overriding Gov. Roy Cooper’s (D) veto. (Video: Julie Yoon/The Washington Post)  In South Carolina, Republicans are moving a bill through the state legislature that would ban most abortions once fetal cardiac activity is detected, which is around the sixth week of pregnancy. The Republican governor ordered lawmakers back into session to complete unfinished work, including on legislation restricting abortions. A near-total ban in the state recently failed.  Advertisement  The dynamics underscore the resistance GOP lawmakers are facing over restrictions even within their own party, as Republican hard-liners reluctantly move toward legislation many see as a compromise, after failing to muster enough support for stricter measures.  Until recently, North Carolina’s legislature had no hope of passing any kind of abortion ban, subject to Cooper’s veto pen. But the dynamic shifted in April, when Republicans gained the votes necessary to override his veto after Rep. Tricia Cotham left the Democratic Party for the Republican Party.  When the 12-week ban initially passed in early May with Cotham’s support, Cooper launched an aggressive effort to prevent a veto override, targeting a handful of moderate Republicans, including Cotham, who pledged during their campaigns to oppose further restrictions on abortion.  “If just one Republican in either the House or the Senate keeps a campaign promise to protect women’s reproductive health, we can stop this ban,” Cooper said at a rally before he vetoed the bill on Saturday, surrounded by a crowd of abortion rights supporters.  Republicans in the legislature say they hope the 12-week ban will become a model for the rest of the country, portraying the bill as a “mainstream” alternative to abortion bans that outlaw abortion earlier in pregnancy. It is the first new abortion ban to pass since the fall of Roe v. Wade that does not outlaw all or most abortions, effectively allowing roughly 90 percent of abortions to continue. Major provisions of the bill, such as the 12-week limit on most abortions, will go into effect July 1, with some other restrictions beginning Oct. 1.  Advertisement  The Senate debated the bill for roughly an hour, with Democrats criticizing the proposed restrictions on abortion and Republicans defending the measure. The House debate was also quick, lasting roughly 90 minutes.  “I think this is really in line with what the majority of North Carolinians believe and so I’m not particularly concerned about the backlash,” North Carolina state Sen. Amy Galey (R) said in an interview. “It’s a reasonable bill for this time.”  Republicans have staunchly rejected the characterization of the bill as a “ban,” repeatedly interrupting Democrats on the Senate floor who used the term and asking them to rephrase.  “A ban is when you can’t do something,” Galey said. “‘Ban’ is a really harsh word.”  Democrats insisted the restrictions would have a broader impact on care during pregnancy, arguing patients have been denied lifesaving care in states where abortions have been banned.  Advertisement  “You as lawmakers are betraying your constituents and knowingly putting North Carolinians in danger,” state Sen. Gladys A. Robinson (D) said on the Senate floor Tuesday. “This monster abortion ban will lead to substandard care.”  North Carolina Democrats have argued fiercely that the legislation would halt abortions long before the 12-week mark, expressing particular concern about a provision that would require patients to have an in-person consultation with a doctor at least 72 hours before an abortion, in addition to the visit required for the abortion itself.  The extra in-person visit would make it harder for out-of-state patients to travel to North Carolina, which currently allows abortion until 20 weeks of pregnancy and has become a destination for patients seeking abortions across the South in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling. In the first two months after the landmark decision, North Carolina experienced a greater spike in abortions than any other state.  Advertisement  Cooper flatly rejected the depiction of the 12-week ban as “mainstream.”  “This is an abortion ban that dramatically reduces women’s health-care freedom,” Cooper said in an interview. “They’re trying to dress this up as a reasonable 12-week ban. It’s not.”  The new legislation will establish exceptions for rape and incest through 20 weeks, along with an exception for lethal fetal anomalies through 24 weeks and a general exception for the life of the mother. Unlike many other abortion restrictions, the ban is coupled with tens of millions of dollars in funding for child care, foster care and paid family leave — money that GOP lawmakers said was added to address criticisms from abortion rights advocates that conservatives often seek to ban abortions but fail to support mothers and babies.  The passage of the 12-week abortion ban in North Carolina earlier this month was the culmination of months of highly secretive meetings in the Republican caucus where lawmakers struggled to agree on an abortion ban that could win enough votes to override a veto.  Rather than introducing the proposal as a new bill, as is typical, Republicans instead gutted a different piece of legislation and inserted the 46-page abortion bill, allowing them to circumvent the usual committee process, which can take weeks or months — a move Democrats called fitting for an autocracy.  Advertisement  “I just don’t believe this is how democracy should work,” House Minority Leader Robert Reives (D) said in a hearing this month. “This affects the rights of one-half of the population of this state.”  Conversations about a potential abortion ban began in Raleigh, the state capital, soon after the Supreme Court ruling, according to several people familiar with the events who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. While a plurality of Republicans supported a stricter ban that would outlaw abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, the people said, several moderate Republicans stood their ground and refused to go beyond 12 weeks, keenly aware of the political backlash to strict abortion bans that has been mounting since the decision.  In the months since Roe was overturned, voters have repeatedly demonstrated their strong support for abortion rights, striking down antiabortion amendments even in conservative states such as Kentucky and Kansas. The 2022 midterms, in which a number of Democrats won competitive races after making abortion rights a central issue, were widely viewed as a danger sign for Republicans.  Advertisement  Heading into the 2023 legislative session, North Carolina was in a unique position. With a Republican-led legislature and a Democratic governor, the state needed far more votes than others to pass abortion restrictions.  “We were trying to do something there really wasn’t a blueprint for,” said one person involved in the discussions. “We’re an evenly divided state, so we knew we needed a middle way.”  That wasn’t the case for Nebraska, where conservative lawmakers and antiabortion advocates were surprised by the source of the opposition. Late last month, a proposed ban earlier in pregnancy failed to pass the legislature, sparking furious conversations among Republicans and antiabortion advocates on the path forward.  Sen. Merv Riepe, a longtime Republican in the technically nonpartisan legislature, abstained from voting to advance a bill banning most abortions after fetal cardiac activity is detected at roughly six weeks — a move one antiabortion advocate called a “shocking betrayal.”  Advertisement  Activists and conservative lawmakers quickly regrouped and began charting a path forward to tighten abortion access. Those discussions culminated in an amendment to a bill that would limit access to gender-affirming care from Sen. Ben Hansen, the chair of the Nebraska legislature’s health committee. The proposed amendment would ban most abortions at 12 weeks, though it includes exceptions for rape, incest and the life and health of the mother, as well as make changes to the underlying bill restricting care for transgender youth.  Riepe ultimately supported the amendment.  “I’m pleased to get 12 weeks, still I would like to have more protections for physicians,” Riepe said. “In this process we’ve managed to make nobody happy. When neither side is perfectly happy, then you have a pretty good bill.” He asked for colleagues to work with him next session to ensure doctors don’t face criminal penalties.  Advertisement  Riepe had previously pushed the legislature to get behind a 12-week ban, but his proposal had barred most abortions 12 weeks after an egg is fertilized, which is a longer window than the 12-week gestational limit under consideration, which is measured by the first day of the woman’s last menstrual period.  The one-chamber legislature adopted the amendment Tuesday night, and the earliest a final vote on the legislation could be scheduled is Friday, but no decision has been made, according to the speaker’s office.  Abortion rights advocates have denounced the new proposed restrictions as well as the effort to tie the ban to a measure limiting gender-affirming care for transgender youth. Meanwhile, antiabortion groups say they’re conflicted: They understand the political reality on the ground and want Nebraska to pass the 12-week limit but are frustrated that most abortions would be allowed to continue.  The 12-week ban is “not what we had anticipated or hoped for, even just a few weeks ago — it’s the situation that we found ourselves in,” said Nate Grasz, the policy director for Nebraska Family Alliance.

In total, 103 homes were completely destroyed and 140 severely damaged in the fighting, the United Nations said Tuesday, citing officials in Gaza.  Belal Nabhan, 35, earns just 10 shekels ($2.70) a day selling parsley in the market, and said he remains in a state of shock.

Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza, which is ruled by Islamist group Hamas, have fought multiple wars in recent years.  The ruins of past conflicts -- such as a three-day escalation in August which killed 49 Gazans -- are dotted across the densely populated Palestinian territory.  With Gaza's poverty rate at 53 percent, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, few people can afford to rebuild their homes.  - 'My dreams are gone' -  In Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, children clambered atop a huge mound of concrete and rebar flattened by Israeli bombardment.  In the tightly-packed neighborhood, Mohammed Zidan's home escaped a direct hit but the blast was so powerful it blew out the walls.  ""Because you want to strike one person, you don't need to destroy a whole apartment complex,"" said the 29-year-old.  ""I'm a young man, living in my house, with my children in my home. I'm focusing on my work. What's my fault, that you make me pay the price?""  As Zidan stepped over the remains of his bedroom on Monday, Palestinians elsewhere were commemorating the Nakba, or catastrophe.  It marks the expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their homes, in the war which erupted when Israel was created in 1948.  ""We will stay living the life of the Nakba, continuously,"" said Zidan, who has taken to sleeping on the street behind his home.  The Israeli military did not immediately respond to an enquiry from AFP on why it targeted the neighborhood.  A fragile ceasefire has largely held since late Saturday, ending the repeated rounds of Israeli strikes and volleys of rocket fire launched by Palestinian militants.  The fighting killed 33 people in Gaza, including children as well as militants, and two civilians in Israel.  Sitting in a donated wheelchair in Bir al-Najeh, Haneen Nabhan said she fainted when she heard her home was destroyed.  ""I used to take medicine, but the medicine's in the rubble,"" she said.

LOUIS - Rising majestically from the landscape of East St. Louis, Illinois, the Gateway Geyser is a powerful testament to human ingenuity and ambition. This 630-feet tall water fountain, one of the tallest in the world, is an iconic centerpiece of the Malcolm W. Martin Memorial Park and a cherished symbol of the city's relationship with its neighboring metropolis, St. Louis, Missouri.  The Gateway Geyser was first unveiled in 1995 as part of an extensive initiative to rejuvenate and beautify the East St. Louis waterfront. Its inauguration marked a new chapter for the city, symbolizing its transformative journey and adding a unique feature to its skyline that rivaled the grandeur of the Gateway Arch located just across the Mississippi River.  This man-made marvel was made possible through intricate engineering and design. Its remarkable height is achieved by three 800-horsepower pumps that can propel 7,500 gallons of water per minute straight up into the sky at a speed of 250 feet per second. When the wind speed is less than 4 mph, the Geyser can reach its maximum height of 630 feet, equal to that of the iconic Gateway Arch.  The Gateway Geyser's operation mimics the cycles of its natural counterparts. From Memorial Day through Labor Day, the Geyser erupts daily at noon for 10 minutes, displaying an awe-inspiring show of power and elegance. These exhibitions are subject to favorable wind, weather, and drought conditions. During the colder months, from September through May, the Geyser enters a period of hibernation, its grand display pausing until the arrival of warmer weather.  Article continues after sponsor message  The Geyser's existence and the surrounding park owes much to the vision and dedication of Malcolm W. Martin, a St. Louis native, and veteran of World War II. Martin was a local lawyer, philanthropist, and community leader who played a pivotal role in the creation of the Gateway Geyser. He was instrumental in the formation of the Gateway Center of Metropolitan St. Louis, which worked tirelessly for four decades to protect the land from commercial development.  Martin dreamed of extending the Memorial Park to encompass both sides of the river, honoring the original vision of Eero Saarinen, the architect of the Gateway Arch. This dream was realized in part when, in 2005, the Gateway Center transferred the title of the Gateway Geyser and over 30 acres of land to the Metro East Park and Recreation District (MEPRD).  Today, the Malcolm W. Martin Memorial Park is a serene green space housing not only the Gateway Geyser but also the Mississippi River Overlook. This 40-foot tall structure offers unparalleled views of the Gateway Arch, the Mississippi River, and the St. Louis skyline. It's a favorite spot for photographers and visitors seeking to capture the majesty of the city's skyline and the towering Geyser.  The Gateway Geyser stands as a tribute to East St. Louis's resilience, ambition, and unity. With each eruption, it celebrates the enduring bond between East St. Louis and St. Louis, reaching skyward in a display of strength and aspiration. It embodies the city's past, present, and future, symbolizing its transformative journey and serving as a beacon of hope for the future.  The Gateway Geyser is more than a man-made marvel; it's a testament to human creativity, a symbol of regional identity, and a beacon of civic pride. It is a monument to the city's vision for growth, the fulfillment of a shared dream, and a celebration of a community's ability to rise and thrive.  More like this:"

Star Trek's midlife crisis landed in the '00s.  Nemesis, the tenth Trek movie, had brought the film series to a stuttering halt, consigning the old odd numbers bad, even numbers good theory to history (check out our Star Trek movies, ranked worst to best article to see what we mean). On the small screen, meanwhile, the premature cancellation of Enterprise had brought 18 continuous years of storytelling on the final frontier to an end. A wilderness period to rival Doctor Who's absence between 1989 and 2005 could easily have been on the cards.  Luckily, it took less than a year for J.J. Abrams (fresh off the success of Lost and Mission: Impossible III) to accept the brief of resurrecting an ailing saga. And, much like Nicholas Meyer did on The Wrath of Khan, he brought the eye of a non-fan to a franchise that had become somewhat set in its ways.  Given his subsequent relocation to a famous galaxy far, far away, it may be appropriate that Abrams' formula for the movie was to Star Wars it up. Star Trek (as it was economically branded) prioritized box-office friendly spectacle over the more cerebral corners of sci-fi. At the same time, it pulled off the seemingly impossible feat of telling an origin story for Kirk, Spock, and Bones, while also keeping their fates a mystery. This unlikely Schrödinger's canon scenario was achieved by creating an entirely new continuity (the so-called Kelvin timeline) via the ingenious combination of a post-Next Generation Spock, a vengeful Romulan commander, and the noble sacrifice of Captain Kirk's Dad, George.  (Image credit: Paramount Pictures)  Star Trek was exciting, emotional, and entertaining, and – as long as you looked past the odd narrative inconsistency – largely faithful to existing canon. It also broadened the franchise's appeal beyond the traditional fanbase, and subsequently became the highest grossing movie in the series by several light years.  Four years later, Star Trek into Darkness arrived on a warp bubble of hype and anticipation, but Wikipedia controversy (opens in new tab) created by the absent colon in the title was just the tip of the iceberg. Abrams' follow-up undid everything its predecessor got right and sent the Kelvinverse spinning wildly off course.  Into Darkness started off promisingly enough: Spock in danger, the Enterprise hidden underwater, and an audacious mission to save a primitive civilization from a volcanic eruption. This spectacular violation of the Prime Directive prompted a brief demotion for Kirk, until a series of terrorist attacks left his mentor, Christopher Pike, dead, and Starfleet on a defensive footing.  From here, the movie never recovered. Darker sequels have become something of a Hollywood cliché, but this was a particularly unnecessary swerve away from the fun adventure vibe of the first movie. With Kirk and the crew forced into an Apocalypse Now-style manhunt to track down fugitive assassin John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch), Into Darkness squandered the easy chemistry the cast had established first time out. Chris Pine's Kirk suffered more than most, as the pressure of command robbed him of the rogue-ish charm that made him the MVP of the first film.  (Image credit: Paramount Pictures)  But – with the possible exception of Carol Marcus's gratuitous shuttlecraft striptease – Into Darkness 's biggest crime was its obsession with places Star Trek has boldly gone before. Indeed, after the massive narrative hoops the first film jumped through to make this Kelvin timeline a blank slate, this was something of a wasted opportunity.  Fan service is now so baked into the DNA of Star Trek and Star Wars that you could forgive the presence of Marcus (mother of Kirk's son in the original timeline) and the references to Harry Mudd and Christine Chapel. However, the Enterprise's detour to apprehend Harrison on the Klingon homeworld only made sense as an excuse to reintroduce the franchise's most famous alien bad guys.  And did anyone ever really believe that John Harrison was the aggressor's real name? Despite multiple protests to the contrary from cast and crew, his true identity – he was Khan Noonien Singh all along! – ranked among the worst-kept secrets in sci-fi. The subterfuge wasn't even worth the effort because this new version was Khan in name only.  Crucially, Into Darkness forgot that it was the rage that simmered during 15 years of exile that turned Khan into such a memorable antagonist in The Wrath of Khan. For all his genetically engineered superior intellect, Khan 2.0 was only a big deal because we already knew he was. That's probably why Leonard Nimoy's Spock Prime showed up to tell newbies that Khan Noonien Singh is the most dangerous adversary the Enterprise ever faced – a moment every bit as clunky as Palpatine telling the pre-teen Anakin Skywalker he'll watch his career with great interest.  (Image credit: Paramount Pictures)  But the true nadir of Star Trek into Darkness came in a final act that morphed into a weird cover version of The Wrath of Khan. As dialogue was recycled verbatim and Kirk (rather than Spock) sacrificed himself to save the Enterprise from certain doom, the sequence's biggest achievement was reminding you of the brilliance of the original. The over-played grief of Spock – a man who could barely stand to be in the same room as Kirk just a few hours earlier – couldn't get close to the impact of William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy's touching farewell in The Wrath of Khan.  These missteps didn't do the movie any harm at the box office, where it made significantly more money worldwide than Star Trek. In most regards, however, the Kelvin timeline never really recovered.  With Abrams otherwise engaged on The Force Awakens, Fast & Furious regular Justin Lin took the helm for 2016's Star Trek Beyond. They made a noble attempt to explore new territory (albeit while destroying the Enterprise… again), but it was definitely one to file under fun but forgettable.  (Image credit: Paramount Plus)  In the years since, Paramount have repeatedly tried to get the cast back together for a fourth time – most notably for a story that would reunite Kirk with his late dad, George (Thor's Chris Hemsworth) – but for the time being the Kelvin-verse seems stuck in limbo. And with the tragic death of Anton Yelchin (opens in new tab), who played Chekov in the Kelvinverse movies, a full reunion is sadly off the cards for good.  But, does Star Trek even need movie theaters anymore? With four existing shows on the Paramount Plus roster and another – Starfleet Academy – on the way, the TV branch of the franchise is in better health than ever. Plus, with the Michelle Yeoh-starring Section 31 movie also coming to the streaming platform in the near future, it seems that the newly launched Enterprise-A may be stuck in Spacedock forever.  That's a shame, because the rebooted original series crew were denied the opportunity to live up to their massive potential. How different things could have been had Into Darkness captured the imagination like its predecessor…"

The global mantle flow models developed by Bodur and Flament reveal that Earth’s deepest mantle and the surface are connected by broad mantle upwellings – pillars of heat that carry material from the base of the mantle to the surface. These upwellings can trigger kimberlites, small but powerful volcanic eruptions that often contains diamonds.  Their models – developed with supercomputers at The National Computational Infrastructure (NCI) in Canberra – show that the dynamics in the deepest mantle impact the surface and where kimberlites will erupt over time.  The models also show that at the centres of these pillars of heat, Earth’s mantle flows upward much faster so that it can carry dense basal mantle material, creating different chemical compositions between the kimberlite samples.  Dr Bodur said the research showcases how Earth’s mineral resources, in this case diamonds, can be prospected in space and time using global mantle flow models.  “The models we have developed may also be used to predict where other mineral deposits may form. This opens opportunities for the minerals industry mitigating their risk in continental-scale exploration.”  Up to now, Geoscience Australia has been providing mineral potential maps that are based on geological and geophysical data to help industry to decrease their risk associated with minerals exploration. The new models developed by Bodur and Flament provide diamond potential maps supported by a geodynamic model.  This work comes at a time when reliable physical models of Earth’s interior are more important than ever. Investigating minerals that will facilitate the world’s transition to green energy using global mantle flow models has become more urgent.  Associate Professor Flament said that the work shows how “the very long-distance relationship” between Earth’s surface and the deepest mantle works in real space and time.  “This relationship was predicted by geologists who observed overlapping seismic tomographic maps of the deepest mantle and kimberlite sites at the surface, but they were lacking a physical explanation.”  “We have shown that this relationship has existed for hundreds of millions of years, but not in the way it was imagined; broad mantle upwelling is rooted on Earth’s basal mantle and is slowly moving as opposed to its previously assumed fixed location.”"

According to the police, the violence first began on Saturday when members of the community gathered outside the town’s police station to protest against a social media post in relation to The Kerala Story.  The post in question was reportedly a conversation between two residents the screenshot of which was shared on Instagram by one of them and “hurt the religious sentiments” of the other person.  “During a chat between two individuals, one person purposely tried to hurt the religious sentiments of another person after which the screenshot of those messages were shared on Instagram,” a police official told The Indian Express.

That’s the way veteran Stoneman Douglas baseball coach Todd Fitz-Gerald describes his team these days.  And it’s hard to argue when you watch the Eagles play and see just how far above they seem to be from the competition.  Douglas was at it again on Tuesday night, making one of the best teams in the state look outmatched as they dominated Columbus for a 10-1 victory in the Region 4-7A final at Anthony Rizzo Field.  The Eagles (27-0) advanced to the state final four for the third consecutive season and are two wins away from winning their third consecutive state title and likely their third consecutive national title.  Douglas is ranked No. 1 nationally by Baseball America. They’ve won 49 consecutive games - the nation’s longest active streak. And it would become the first team in Broward County history to complete a perfect season if it can win those two games starting with a state semifinal matchup next Tuesday against Port Orange Spruce Creek at 7 p.m. at Hammond Stadium in Fort Myers.  They would be the first team from South Florida to go unbeaten since Miami Westminster Christian in 1996. But even that team had one tie.  “They’re just a different group of kids and nothing bothers them,” Fitz-Gerald said. “Today, they just did what they’ve been doing all year. Once the bats get going, it seems to have a never ending effect and they keep passing the baton to the next guy.”  Fitz-Gerald was describing the latest offensive eruption by his club, which scored nine runs in the second inning including six against previously unbeaten Columbus ace and Stetson signee Gabe Cruz.  The Eagles hit three home runs in the inning including back-to-back blasts by first baseman Matt Ossenfort and Niko Benestad. Alex Rodriguez also hit a two-run home run. Douglas sent 14 batters to the plate in that frame as Ossenfort came up and hit an RBI ground-rule double and Benestad followed with a two-run single in their respective second at-bats of that inning.  Story continues  Marjory Stoneman Douglas’ Matthew Ossenfort (17) reacts after hitting a home run against Christopher Columbus in the second inning of their Region 4-7A baseball game final at Anthony Rizzo Field on Tuesday, May 16, 2023, in Parkland, Fla. MATIAS J. OCNER/mocner@miamiherald.com  Columbus used three pitchers in that inning until Nick Zarranz stopped the bleeding and allowed only one run over 4⅓ innings. Carlos Jacome was one of Columbus’ few bright spots, going 2 for 2 and driving in the Explorers’ lone run in the fifth inning.  The Explorers (24-5) entered the game on a 16-game winning streak that started after they gave Douglas one of its toughest challenges of the season before losing 8-6 on March 24.  “Gabe was at 90-91 mph today and we’ve seen guys throwing 95-96 this season,” Fitz-Gerald said. “It’s just a lineup that is really good at making adjustments and they’re just baseball rats. They come to work every day and they don’t horse around. I don’t have to motivate them at all. They motivate themselves.”  Marjory Stoneman Douglas’ Matthew Ossenfort (17) hits a home run against Christopher Columbus in the second inning of their Region 4-7A baseball game final at Anthony Rizzo Field on Tuesday, May 16, 2023, in Parkland, Fla.

For the fifth consecutive year, every single senior has been accepted into a two or four-year college or university.  At a college signing ceremony Tuesday afternoon, each student declared where they would be going after high school.  Alexandra Gonzalez-Amaro and Adrian Ramirez were two seniors who gave speeches at the event.  “I’ve been looking forward to this day for the longest time,” Gonzales-Amaro exclaimed.  “The moment I walked into the school, I felt welcome and I felt like I belonged here. You’re going into a journey but you’re never doing it alone.”  Gonzales-Amaro will be going to Notre Dame to study political science on the pre-law track. Ramirez announced he will be attending Marquette University on a full-ride scholarship to study mechanical engineering.  “Especially as a Hispanic, first-generation student, we want to embrace the change we have to offer. We’re as important as everyone else to go to college and show the world what we can do,” Ramirez said.  The students at Cristo Rey are involved in a work-study program that places them in different companies across the greater Milwaukee area throughout their time in school. President of Cristo Rey Jesuit High School, Andrew Stith, says the students leave with knowledge both inside and outside of the classroom.  “We really look to empower our students to take that next step and contribute to the Milwaukee community,” Stith said.  While several students like Gonzales-Amaro are headed out of state, the majority will attend local colleges, like the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Marquette University, and the Milwaukee Area Technical College.  “They’re a lot of great choices right here in Milwaukee. We want them to stay here in Milwaukee because we need good leaders to build the future,” Stith said.  According to their website, Cristo Rey Jesuit High School is the third largest feeder school to Marquette University.  This year, the senior class is receiving over $17 million in scholarships. It’s also the first class to have a division one athlete.  “Although it may be one student crossing the stage, it sets the expectation for a family to do something similar. That can change the community in pretty significant ways,” Stith explained.  The Cristo Rey Jesuit High School graduation ceremony will be held on June 2.  It’s about time to watch on your time.

Simmons spent Mother's Day in mourning.  Deshawn Talley was a young man with big dreams, according to his grieving mother. He displayed determination and a strong work ethic from an early age, having secured his first job at just 15. Throughout his life, it was always just Deshawn and his mother. Simmons says her son was her best friend.  She says Deshawn was spending a Friday evening with his friends in Edgehill when gunfire erupted.  Metro Nashville Police Department officers discovered Deshawn's body on the back porch of a nearby home. Witnesses told police they heard gunshots coming from the vicinity of 14th Avenue South.  Simmons expressed how the devastating news had completely changed her life. She says she can't help but reflect on their last conversation.  ""He was like, 'Even I know, we all get to die.' But he was like, 'Even the other life or wherever we go to die. I always want you to be my mama. I always want you by my side.'""  Even through this death, this mother said she will never leave her son's side and will get him justice. These parents will keep fighting until the people responsible are held accountable.  Homicide detectives are now urging the community to step forward and assist in the investigation. Surveillance footage has revealed a black Nissan Armada as the suspect vehicle in Deshawn's murder.  Any information related to the vehicle or the incident is crucial to progressing the case. If you have seen the SUV or possess any information that may aid the investigation, it is imperative to contact the police immediately."

There are 228 days left in the year.  Today's Highlight in History:  On May 17, 1954, a unanimous U.S. Supreme Court handed down its Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka decision which held that racially segregated public schools were inherently unequal, and therefore unconstitutional.  On this date:  In 1536, Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer declared the marriage of England's King Henry VIII to Anne Boleyn invalid after she failed to produce a male heir; Boleyn, already condemned for high treason, was executed two days later.  In 1940, the Nazis occupied Brussels, Belgium, during World War II.  In 1946, President Harry S. Truman seized control of the nation's railroads, delaying - but not preventing - a threatened strike by engineers and trainmen.  In 1973, a special committee convened by the U.S. Senate began its televised hearings into the Watergate scandal.  In 1980, rioting that claimed 18 lives erupted in Miami's Liberty City after an all-white jury in Tampa acquitted four former Miami police officers of fatally beating Black insurance executive Arthur McDuffie.  In 1987, 37 American sailors were killed when an Iraqi warplane attacked the U.S. Navy frigate Stark in the Persian Gulf. (Iraq apologized for the attack, calling it a mistake, and paid more than $27 million in compensation.)  In 1996, President Bill Clinton signed a measure requiring neighborhood notification when sex offenders move in. (""Megan's Law,"" as it's known, was named for Megan Kanka, a 7-year-old New Jersey girl who was raped and murdered in 1994.)  In 2004, Massachusetts became the first state to allow same-sex marriages.  In 2010, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that young people serving life prison terms should have ""a meaningful opportunity to obtain release"" provided they didn't kill their victims.  In 2015, a shootout erupted between bikers and police outside a restaurant in Waco, Texas, leaving nine of the bikers dead and 20 people injured.  In 2017, the Justice Department appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as a special counsel to oversee a federal investigation into potential coordination between Russia and the 2016 Donald Trump campaign.  In 2020, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo was tested for the coronavirus on live TV as he announced that all people in the state who were experiencing flu-like symptoms were eligible for tests.  Ten years ago: The ousted head of the Internal Revenue Service, Steven Miller, faced hours of intense grilling before Congress; both defiant and apologetic, Miller acknowledged agency mistakes in targeting tea party groups for special scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status, but insisted that agents broke no laws and that there was no effort to cover up their actions. Jorge Rafael Videla (HOHR'-hay rah-fay-EHL' vih-DEH'-lah), 87, the former dictator who took power in Argentina in a 1976 coup and led a military junta that killed thousands during a ""dirty war"" against alleged subversives, died in Buenos Aires while serving life in prison for crimes against humanity.  Five years ago: With six Democrats joining Republicans in voting to confirm her, Gina Haspel won Senate confirmation to become director of the CIA. The Miss America Organization announced that it would now have women in its three top leadership positions, after an email scandal in which male officials were caught making vulgar and insulting comments about past winners.  One year ago: President Joe Biden condemned the poison of white supremacy and said the nation must ""reject the lie"" of the racist ""replacement theory"" espoused by a shooter who killed 10 Black people in Buffalo, New York. Mariupol appeared on the verge of falling to the Russians as Ukraine moved to abandon the steel plant where hundreds of its fighters held out for months under relentless bombardment in the last bastion of resistance in the devastated city.

The report singles out the FBI for acting on ""raw, unanalyzed, and uncorroborated intelligence,"" and for handling ""important aspects"" of the probe in a ""seriously deficient"" manner rife with ""confirmation bias.""  Though legal experts widely panned the report as a failure, Trump declared it a win on Truth Social.  ""WOW! After extensive research, Special Counsel John Durham concludes the FBI never should have launched the Trump-Russia Probe!"" Trump wrote. ""In other words, the American Public was scammed, just as it is being scammed right now by those who don't want to see GREATNESS for AMERICA!""  ""The Durham Report spells out in great detail the Democrat Hoax that was perpetrated upon me and the American people,"" the ex-president said in another post.

Following the report's release, legal experts have flagged that the report is missing critical components and should be viewed with scrutiny.  Former U.S. Attorney Barb McQuade, a University of Michigan law professor, took to Twitter to underscore some of the report's omissions, which she feels contributed to an incorrect conclusion that the FBI probe into Trump's dealings with the Kremlin was baseless.  The ""FBI was properly concerned about Russia's efforts to influence the presidential election,"" she tweeted.  ""Trump had other concerning ties to Russians: real estate deals, Miss Universe Pageant, loans from Russian lenders, Trump Tower Moscow project,"" McQuade continued. ""Campaign Chairman Paul Manafort had lobbied for pro-Russian oligarchs. Trump campaign members also had ties to Russia. Mike Flynn was paid $45,000 by Russia Today in 2015 for a speech he gave at a banquet where he sat next to Putin. He later lied to FBI about his calls with the Russian ambassador about sanctions during the transition.""  ""Failing to investigate these ties would have been a breach of duty by FBI,"" McQuade asserted. ""The Durham Report provides fuel for the false claim that the Russia probe was a hoax.

Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Nihal Thalduwa told the media that the Friday’s massive security operation followed “intelligence reports” about “an anti-government group planning to create disturbances” and emphasised that “security measures will remain until further notice.”  The Daily Mirror.lk quoted “highly placed security sources” who claimed “IUSF [Inter University Student Federation] students were planning to march into the city in their hundreds over the weekend to take over key government institutions and launch a fresh ‘Aragalaya’ (struggle) against the government.”  Ministry of Defence Director (Media) Col. Nalin Herath told Sunday Morning: “Security in Colombo will be increased for the next few days, due to multiple reasons, including a planned rehearsal for various contingencies, such as natural disasters or terror attacks.”  On Monday, the government ended its special military and police deployment but police spokesperson, SSP Thalduwa, declared that its “normal security program will remain.”  Last weekend’s security operation in Colombo had nothing to do with responding to “natural disasters or terror attacks,” nor was it related to an alleged lunchtime gathering of the ISUF, the pseudo-left Frontline Socialist Party’s student organisation, at Colombo University.  Rather, it was part of Wickremesinghe’s increasing use of the police and military to crush future struggles, including strikes and protests by workers and youth against the government’s International Monetary Fund austerity measures.  Sri Lanka’s ruling elite is acutely sensitive to the rising social opposition to the Wickremesinghe government, fearful that this will develop into the sort of mass uprising that last year ousted President Gotabhaya Rajapakse.  Last Tuesday, Cabinet spokesman Bandula Gunawardena told an official media briefing that the cabinet discussed how to respond to the possible eruption of mass struggles on the May 9 anniversary of violent demonstrations across Sri Lanka.  Those protests, which included setting fire to Wickremesinghe’s official residence and other government parliamentarian’s homes, however, were a response against a series of brutal attacks by pro-Rajapakse thugs on anti-government protesters on Galle Face Green.  Gunawardena told the media briefing that cabinet ministers discussed the formation of a special presidential commission to investigate how to respond to future mass struggles. He claimed no definite decision had been taken and would not provide any further details.  While the government is nervous about rising anti-government sentiment among workers and the rural poor over its escalating social assault, it retains political power because the unions are working tooth and nail to prevent any independent mobilisation of the working class.  Under conditions where the unions are finding it increasingly difficult to suppress workers’ opposition, the government is more and more preparing to use police and military repression to crush workers’ struggles.  For millions of Sri Lankans life is becoming unbearable. The percentage of Sri Lankans living in poverty doubled from 13 percent in 2021 to 25 percent in 2022.  Commodity prices and inflation continue to increase, sharply eroding the purchasing power of the masses who face severe food insecurity. Hundreds of thousands of jobs have been lost in the private sector, including in the garment and construction industries and the small industry sector.  IMF-dictated austerity, including direct taxes on working people, increased electricity and water tariffs, and other inroads, will further intensify the social disaster facing workers and rural toilers.  In addition, the government is moving to axe hundreds of thousands of jobs through the restructuring and privatisation of state enterprises. This involves 430 state-owned enterprises, including 39 corporations, 218 companies and 173 statutory boards being restructured or privatised under a national agency established by the finance ministry.  Last weekend’s security operation in Colombo is an integral part of readying the police, military and other sections of the repressive state apparatus to deal with the inevitable eruption of working class struggles against the government.  In line with these preparations the Wickremesinghe government has imposed essential service regulations on key public sector areas, criminalising strikes and political action taken by workers in these industries. These regulations are being renewed each month via extraordinary government gazette and the security forces kept on standby nationally under the public security act.  The mass deployment of military and police forces last weekend is a warning to the working class that to fight the government’s social assaults it must organise independently of the trade unions and all bourgeois parties. This requires formation of its own action committees and the development of political and industrial struggle for a workers’ and peasants’ government committed to a socialist and internationalist program."

Minister Gonsalves was among speakers at the official opening of the two Bailey Bridges on Thursday, May 11.  “When the river comes down, never again will people be stuck on either side of the river,” the minister said.  “Never again! because after this temporary bridge, is a permanent bridge. The same thing in Noel. Never again will somebody be on this side talking to somebody on that side.”  Minister Gonsalves said at the ceremony which was held in Overland.  Recalling the hardships endured by commuters in North Windward prior to the installation of the two Bailey bridges, Minister Gonsalves added, “Never again will people from Kingstown run up here with they phone to film something to put on social media and say ‘look, man trapped here so or man trapped there so’.”  Prior to the installation of the bridges at Noel and Overland, commuters spent hours waiting at these river crossings whenever it rained heavily.  The sight of people and vehicles stuck on either side of the rivers was often a photo opportunity for many social media users.  In his address, the Finance Minister reminded the gathering that when the volcano erupted explosively in April 2021, the people in North Windward felt the adverse effects.  Although they were evacuated out of the red zone, the impact was evident on homes, schools farms and shops in the area.  “In the immediate aftermath of the eruption, what we needed was vision,” the Finance Minister said.  While there were people without vision who had lots of ideas, Minister Gonsalves said it was Deputy Prime Minister Montgomery Daniel, who saw the need for the bridges, and he articulated that need to Cabinet.  “After we got the vision for the bridges, we got the vision to assist the people who had been impacted and displaced by the volcano,” the Minister said.  “Without the vision, not only do the people perish, but nothing gets done.”  The bridges were obtained through funding from the World Bank’s Volcano Eruption Emergency Project (VEEP).  The VEEP project also provided income support to residents and farmers.  “We understood what was needed. That is when the Prime Minister contacted the World Bank.”  While the Bailey bridges could last up to 50 years, Minister Gonsalves assured residents of North Windward that “we not leaving them here for 50 years.”  He said a company in Trinidad is already working on the design for three permanent bridges for North Windward.  Apart from replacing the Bailey bridges at Overland and Noel, a permanent bridge is also to be put in place at London.  Minister Gonsalves promised that when the designs are completed, the Bailey bridges will be replaced.  He said the bridges are “part of a package of initiative of over US$40 million, designed to lift up the people of this community and put St Vincent and the Grenadines back on the path to progress”.  Speaking about the vulnerability of the country and the need for resilience, Minister Gonsalves said the test of resilience lies in how quickly one is able to bounce back and get back on one’s feet.  “When we build back, we build back better than before.”  In thanking the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister for the vision, the Finance Minister said “ we will always be in your corner to help you mitigate the vulnerabilities and help make St Vincent and the Grenadines more resilient.”  Project Engineer of VEEP, Nerissa Fergus said the bridge at Noel is 30 meters in length; it was done by K-electric.  That bridge is single lane; while the one at overland is a two lane, 30 meters bridge with a pedestrian walkway.  The bridge at Overland was done by the firm Sea Operators SVG."

Think 2012 meets Geostorm. Or a new take on Kill Bill.  The six-episode series, streaming now, pits Nye against a devastating assortment of disasters, including large-scale asteroid strikes, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunamis, and floods. Okun deftly and seamlessly mixes real footage with visual effects, creating gripping, often scary situations where mankind is at the mercy of the elements, both natural and unnatural. Make sure to bring extra batteries.  Brannon Braga serves as showrunner, director, and EP. The show is produced by Universal Television Alternative Studio, a division of Universal Studio Group, and Fuzzy Door. Seth MacFarlane and Erica Huggins executive produce for Fuzzy Door. Nye also executive produces. Rachel Hargreaves-Heald is the executive in charge of production for Fuzzy Door.  We recently chatted with Okun, who shared his insights on the project’s immense volume of feature-quality VFX, produced on a tight budget and schedule, without previs, or a sturdy umbrella.  Dan Sarto: How early did you come onto the project? What was the creative mandate as to the tone of what to depict with VFX, how much actual disaster footage would be used, how it would integrate with VFX, and how scary / deadly the disasters would be depicted?  Jeff Okun: I was recruited by the show’s writer/director/producer Brannan Braga long before it was even written. He would run ideas by me, and we would riff a bit. But in the end, he just wrote them and sent them to me for budgeting. I like to think we have a great relationship, and he allows me to get involved very early so we can maximize what can be accomplished in the timeframe and budget frame. He is very collaborative before, during and in post. The mandate was to do large-scale feature film disaster effects. 2012 meets Geostorm kind of stuff. We wanted to set the stage with super cool, terrible disaster scenarios and then make it more real by showing actual footage. Integrate the two together to demonstrate how bad it can get in a visceral manner. The disasters were to feel real and very, very scary because of the integration of actual footage with the visual effects footage.  DS: What type of reference, scientific data, concept designs, and actual imagery, did you have to work from, and how much did you deviate / interpret materials to create the VFX, as opposed to recreating actual disaster visuals for circumstances shown in the series?  JO: Brannon is well connected to the science world and as such was able to provide me with great access to experts in the various fields where we were creating the disasters. That and Bill Nye knows a bit about it too. He is the real deal in that he strongly and personally believes in everything he says. So, the mandate with the scientists was to keep it real. And real in these cases are very big, very scary – every scarier when you realize how real it is. I got the opportunity to scientifically demonstrate many concepts of how these disasters are created – sometimes by mankind, sometimes by the nature of our planet. Most of the disasters have not yet occurred in our technologically enhanced civilization, but a few have. But what I realized by working on this show is how close we have come to some very large-scale, world-killing disasters. It was some kind of joy to be showing the world what would happen and how we can either mitigate it, stop it, or survive it using science and visual effects of course!  DS: How many VFX houses did you work with, and how did the production compare (timeframe, volume of shots, previs, pipeline) to previous work you’ve done as a VFX supervisor on features?  JO: We ended up with 12 vendors on the show spread around the globe. We made the show during the height of the “tail of the pandemic” VFX rush; finding vendors who had the capacity and quality we needed was not easy. My VFX Producer, Gene Kozicki, did a great job sourcing several small companies who could do really great work on the harder side of things, like particle systems, rigid body collisions, for the volcanos, the earthquakes, the tsunamis, the asteroid collisions, satellite-based comet re-direction, level 6 hurricanes, floods, dust storms, city destruction, and on and on.  On average, we had about 500-800 shots an episode. We had a very rushed timeline to edit, temp, get approvals and finish the show. We did not have the time or money for previs, but what I would do is shoot something representative or do temp comps with found footage. For example, we have a shot where a plane is being tossed about in a thundercloud and out of nowhere another jet appears and almost crashes into us. I took a highlighter pen, and using post-it notes, made wings and a tail, and stuck them on it. I got some stormy cloud footage on YouTube and using my iPhone shot the highlighter flying in front of the storm footage monitor. I added sound and showed it to Brannan who approved the shot, and off we went to get it made. It’s that kind of fun creative approaches that got us so much so fast for so little.  DS: What were the biggest, most complicated sequences, or types of VFX, you produced?  JO: Every episode had a tentpole shot or five. The volcano episode with the eruption and pyroclastic cloud chasing and then killing Bill Nye – we had to do eruptions, ash covered towns, pyroclastic volcanic plumes with lightning inside them, and of course the flow chasing Bill. In the comet episode, we had to do Tektite rain that ends up killing Bill. For the five simultaneous Category 6 hurricanes, we had to create the storm around Bill, and then have it kill him by blowing him down the street into a parked car and then having an uprooted tree punch Bill through the car and into a storm surge where he drowns. And on and on it went.  But we also had to create a complete museum of disaster with an escalator through a porthole into the various disasters (kind of like a holodeck) and then destroy it all in the final episode. We had to do all this because that is what the show is about – The End of the World is Nye! I loved killing Bill in every episode, and they were always the most fun and creative things to do. The most complex sequences had to do with adding Seth MacFarlane into shots seamlessly. He played the “Act of Cow” part – meaning the person who inadvertently caused or exaggerated the disaster. He was unavailable to us during shooting, so we added him in post. The hardest shot was we moved down the aisle of a jet airliner, and he is in a seat. This was a Steadicam shot with little data to help set it up. So, we shot him with the camera doing the perspective move on him and then had a company in India track him in. They did a great job; it was a very difficult shot. So, as you can see, every episode, almost every disaster sequence was difficult, challenging and fun to solve.  Sometimes we used old-school techniques. For the flooding of the coffee shop in Episode 1, we used a custom-built water tank and shot the glass out with a pellet gun, then comped that into the coffee shop set (which was supposed to be downstairs on the street). We shot the stunt girl diving out of the way and a separate splash element – comped them all together by our in-house team and there you go!  DS: What were the most challenging aspects of the show?  JO: As it turned out, the most challenging aspect of the show was finding vendors. We were put in a situation where tax incentives were paramount. So, our challenge was to find any vendor who was in an approved tax zone who had the capacity and ability. In the end, we mostly went with smaller vendors, like Cos FX in L.A., Blue Fire in Utah, Incessant Rain in Nepal, and Mathematic in Paris. We did have BUF in Paris as well, but as our schedule pushed, they had a hard out date, so we got all the big stuff done early with them. We were also in Spain, Australia, and of course Montreal and Vancouver.  When it comes to shots or VFX sequences, our challenges were about the Oort Cloud surrounding our solar system and Bill floating around, jostling a rock out of the cloud that turns into a world-ending series of comet fragment strikes. In Montreal, Antarctic… and Tahiti, where our senator (Seth) is hiding out because the projections of where the strikes would occur were gotten incorrectly by his office. So, we kill him there! There was also a sequence where Seth is fracking near Yellowstone Park to relieve the pressure building up in the volcano. Again, we added Seth after the fact, and as he exits the frame, he has to bump Bill. Challenging and fun! I could go on and on because every shot is a challenge, but it all works out in the end.  DS: How did your expertise and VFX production experience – skills, tricks – help you on this production, where it might have tripped up in some aspects a lesser experienced supervisor?  JO: Wow! You really want me to get into trouble here, don’t you? Ha! OK. I have been a student of VFX and VFX photography my entire life. I used to study in-camera tricks, the forced perspective sets with varying sized miniature cars, glass matt paintings, and then photo-chemical compositing and finally CGI. Saul Bass gave me the opportunity to meet and work with John Whitney Sr. and Jr. So, I come pretty well armed with varying options and techniques. Knowing when to use which is the trick.  We opted for as much in-camera effects as we could. Then our secondary goto was simple A over B comps – which meant having a good old-fashioned element shoot day. This allowed us to lower the costs and shorten the time in our budget and schedule. Finally, we had saved up enough money and time to take on the really big stuff – crazy 280 mph wind and rain, tidal waves, ground splitting open, buildings crashing down, pyroclastic flows, tektite rain, eruptions, lava pits opening – you know, the fun stuff – all done with plates, elements, and some serious CG.  DS: Did you make use of any virtual production tools, any game engine tools, or any visualization tools on the show?  JO: No. We investigated them but, in the end, we had two issues: first, we did not have the time to prep for their use as the scripts were being written and re-written through the prep period, and second, the instances that they would be good for ended up costing more to do than traditional greenscreens based on where our location was. They would have been great for the driving shots in the tektite rain, the pyroclastic cloud chase, the Space station, and several angles in the Disaster Institute and outside Bill’s lab window – but again, we just didn’t have the time. The Disaster Institute was not fully designed until well into post, for example.  DS: What’s more fun to create – a tornado, a hurricane, a volcano, or some other specific disaster?  JO: You know what's more fun to create – a compelling disaster that’s part of a good story so that it resonates with the viewer and, hopefully, gets them to investigate change for themselves. Whether that is a hurricane, volcanic eruption, tidal wave, plane crash, humorous deaths (like Bill’s) or the end of the planet. Any VFX shot that stands alone is to me, someone saying, “Look what a cool thing I can think of!” Whereas any VFX in service to story – be it tentpole or invisible (the kind I prefer) – is great VFX!  DS: And on a serious note, did it ever get a bit depressing or upsetting to spend time on disaster reference footage when you know the human cost could very well be quite high?  JO: Not at all because we created these horrible scenes of death and destruction to enlighten, change, and cause us all to think a bit more about the world we live in. In a time when borders are becoming more prominent, we need to know that the weather, an earthquake, or volcano, or asteroid, does not care about them. So, we as people of the earth should really come together to do the right thing for ourselves and our planet. If you need a bit of perspective on all this, I urge you to find the Carl Sagan video/speech called “Pale Blue Dot.”  DS: Lastly, what did you enjoy most on this show and why?  JO: I loved doing this show because of 3 things – Brannan Braga, Bill Nye, and the amount of creative input I had. I designed entire sequences and then got to shoot them. Also, the topic of the show – Six ways the world will end – note the word “will,” not “might” – is very important. In a time when scientific facts are being ignored or denied, it makes this show triply important because it shows the way to stop, lessen, or, in the case of no way to avoid it, to survive the disaster. I think as we have seen by the weather this past winter, things are going to happen, probably get worse before they get better and the sooner we humans start to believe it is all real, the easier it will be to spot most of the bad stuff. They say some stuff cannot be stopped, like an asteroid strike, but that’s just not true – just this past year we changed the course of an asteroid – Yay NASA! I like what Neil deGrasse Tyson says, “In the end, the Earth is going to be just fine. It’s the humans who should be worried. The planet was here long before us and will be long after us.”"

The satellite, which was worked on by roughly 200 University of Bristol students over the past seven years, is now nearly ready for a potential launch in early 2024 after it successfully underwent extreme testing at the European Space Agency (ESA).  Designed to monitor active volcanoes and make 3D models of their ash clouds, the device could improve our understanding of volcanoes. The information could also save the aviation industry millions of pounds, by helping to keep planes in the air after an eruption.  To do that, the satellite needs to withstand the hostile environment of space, including extreme vibrations during launch, a vacuum, and temperatures ranging from extremely hot on its Sun-facing side to extremely cold on its space-facing side.  Over the past month, eight students have been at the ESA’s CubeSat Support Facility in Transinne, Belgium, which has facilities to simulate the harsh conditions.  The 20x10x10cm payload has an ultra-high definition camera and an infrared camera, which the team said will be capable of tracking and modelling ash clouds in ways that have not been tried before. At the ESA, it was shaken with violent vibrations before being plunged into a thermal vacuum chamber and subjected to extremes of temperature and pressure.  Project manager and aerospace engineering student Tom Snelling said: “I always wanted to be involved in the space industry, but I never dreamt I could be testing at the European Space Agency as a student.  “Being on the project totally changes students. You have undergraduates joining and within a year they are coding satellites and getting real industry experience – it’s really impressive what they can do.”  Testing on the satellite is ongoing before launch.  Professor Lucy Berthoud, professor of space systems engineering at the University of Bristol, said: ""Few UK universities build satellites, this payload is really ambitious. If it’s successful it will revolutionise our understanding of ash clouds.  “To do this, the students have been learning hands-on skills to build and test a satellite, which will equip them well for positions in the space industry when they finish.""

The cash-strapped nation of over 220 million people will have no other option but to ask China for devising a mechanism to bail out the ailing economy, The News reported. “Amid deepening political and economic crisis in the country, the IMF has adopted a wait and see policy but this cannot be pursued for a longer period,” sources said.  “Either the IMF programme will have to be revived through the completion of the ninth review or the programme will be scrapped. We will share no more data with the IMF without completion of the ninth review,” they added.  Several reports suggest that Pakistan has already conveyed to the IMF staff to conclude the review otherwise budgetary framework for 2023-24 would not be shared, The News reported.  The sources recalled that an ambassador of the western capital, during interactions with a minister inquired when the economy of Pakistan was expected to be in meltdown. “This blunt question from the dignitary shocked the minister who told the visiting diplomat that Pakistan would never default,” the sources narrated.  It should be noted that the diplomatic community also has started inquiring about “domestic political affairs”.  Keeping in view all these developments, independent economists are now suggesting the government make last-ditch efforts in order to revive the IMF programme or clearly look towards China to bailout the struggling economy, The News reported.  Former Finance minister and renowned economist Hafiz A Pasha said that if the IMF doesn’t move forward, then Pakistan would have no other option but to request China to devise any mechanism for helping Islamabad to avert blown out of a full fledge crisis.IANS  "

Davie crushed the ball all over the place, Parker Simmons and Davin Whitaker had monster games and the War Eagles blew out Ragsdale, 12-1, on the road on May 9.  Davie, the 18th seed in the West Region, won its first playoff game since 2019 and improved to 15-10. The 15th-seeded Tigers closed shop at 18-7 after finishing second in the eight-team Metro Conference.  “We played good defense, we threw strikes and we passed the baton to the next guy,” coach Joey Anderson said. “We weren’t swinging for the fences.”  Offensively, the War Eagles did all the damage they needed in the top of the second inning. After Drew Krause and Ty Miller reached, Coy James mashed a triple. Two pitches later, Simmons singled. Then D. Whitaker made it three straight hits as Davie surged to a 4-0 lead.  They put up a twice-as-big crooked number in the seventh to break Ragsdale’s back. A Simmons single ignited a six-hit, eight-run eruption. Whitaker (double), MJ Jacobs and Jackson Sink kept the merry-go-round going with hits. It really got out of hand when Simmons got his second hit of the inning, a three-run double. As if that wasn’t enough, D. Whitaker capped it off with a triple as Davie’s lead mushroomed to 12-1.  Simmons and D. Whitaker went absolutely bonkers. The former went 5 for 5 with three runs and four RBIs in the two hole. The latter went 4-5 in the three hole.  Simmons distinguished himself by hitting .322 last year as a junior, but he struggled badly at the beginning of 2023. Batting anywhere from seventh to ninth in the first six games, he started 0 for 13. He moved up to the two hole for the March 16 home game against East Forsyth, a 5-1 win, and he made Anderson look like a genius. In the 19 games between March 16 and Ragsdale, Simmons hit .379 (22 for 58). At Ragsdale, his average soared from .257 to .309.  Wait, there’s more. Simmons’ 5-for-5 work in the first rounder was the Davie’s first five-hit performance between 1999-2023, a span of 574 games.  “We’ve been watching him grow year by year,” Anderson said. “He struggled a little bit early. When you see a D-I guy as many times as we do, you’re not going to have a Coy James batting average. He’s worked hard and he’s stepped up.”  “Being my senior year, I was frustrated with getting off to a slow start,” Simmons said. “I wasn’t seeing the ball well and wasn’t finding the barrel. Nothing was really working for me.  “It all kind of changed when coach Joey moved me into the two hole against East Forsyth,” Simmons continued. “I was confused about why he moved me to the two hole, but batting me between Coy and Davin has worked out for us. I’m thankful it’s picked up, especially at this time in the playoffs.”  Interestingly enough, the seventh-inning double was Simmons’ first extra-base hit in two years; his other 40 hits were singles.  “I got fastballs all night, so I was expecting a curveball or something offspeed,” Simmons said. “I sat curveball, I guessed right and I hit a double to left-center.”  D. Whitaker was slow out of the gate as well. After seven games, he was at .166 (3 for 18). What’s he hitting since then? How about .442 over 18 games (23 for 52). For the season, the senior left Ragsdale at .371 with a .900 slugging percentage and a .494 on-base percentage.  “Those (five) seniors have stepped up,” Anderson said.  “Davin’s really hard on himself in practice, but in the games it shows he works a lot because he’s been in a groove,” Simmons said. “I mean there’s nobody that can throw it by him.”  “I was squaring balls up and they were going straight to people (in the first seven games),” D. Whitaker said. “But that’s baseball. I’m making a team swing and not a me swing. Earlier in the year, I was going up there for me. The more you focus on the team, the better the outcome is.”  Meanwhile, Braeden Rodgers showed impressive poise on the mound when the Tigers had a chance to make noise in the fifth. The score was 4-1 and they had runners at the corners with no outs. Rodgers fielded a dribbler back to the mound, faked a throw to second and quickly spun around. He had the runner from third in a pickle. He threw to third baseman Brady Marshall and Marshall threw to catcher Krause for a 1-5-2 out. With runners at first and third and one out, Rodgers snared a liner and doubled up the runner at third to end the threat.  “The turning point in the game was (the bottom of the fifth),” Anderson said. “You saw the air go out of Ragsdale at that point.”  Rodgers threw six strong innings. The only run was unearned as he walked two and struck out eight. He ran his record to 6-1 and lowered his ERA to 1.90.  “That dynamic duo has kept us in games,” Anderson said of Rodgers and Jaydon Holder.  Reliever Connor Berg added the exclamation point in the bottom of the seventh. The junior missed an immaculate inning by a hair, striking out three batters on 10 pitches. The first batter he faced: strike swinging, strike looking, strike swinging. The second batter: strike looking, strike swinging, foul ball, strike swinging. The third batter: strike looking, foul ball, strike swinging. The same result in nine pitches would have qualified for the extremely rare immaculate inning.  “Connor was locked in,” Anderson said. “(Joey) Cress told him to attack and that’s what he did. He’s accepted that (relief) role and there’s a chance that he can pitch every game.”  Notes: James had a routine night by going 2 for 4 with his fifth triple. Here are his glittering numbers for the season: .460 average, .828 slugging percentage, .559 on-base percentage. He has 17 extra-base hits among his 35 total hits, and he has 17 walks/hit by pitches. … Sink went 2 for 4 as Davie outhit Ragsdale 15-6. … In the other first-round games involving the Central Piedmont Conference, No. 8 Hopewell beat No. 25 Glenn 4-3, No. 14 West Forsyth beat No. 19 Charlotte Catholic 5-4, No. 10 Reagan beat No. 23 South Mecklenburg 1-0 and No. 2 East Forsyth beat No. 31 Olympic 8-3."

The island itself may be small, but there’s no shortage of activities to enjoy.  This island, like its sister islands, was created by a volcanic eruption approximately seven million years ago. The main island is surrounded by several islets that host many of the best resorts.  The locals principally speak Tahitian and French, but some speak English, especially in hospitality. The mantra here is “aita pea pea,” meaning “not to worry.”  Once you arrive at Faa’a International Airport in Tahiti, take a 45-minute flight to Bora Bora, and you’re in paradise. All you have to decide is how much—or how little—you’ll do.  Check Out World Class Beaches  You can’t visit any island without setting aside time for the beach.  Matira Beach, a public stretch of sand, is celebrated for its crystal-clear waters. It’s on the southern shore of Bora Bora, and if you’re coming from the city of Vaitape, you can bike or take a taxi.  One visitor suggests, “If you choose to drive to Matira Beach, you can find parking spaces near the InterContinental Bora Bora Le Moana Resort.”  Aside from swimming, you can snorkel or book a jet ski. Go on your own jet ski adventure (within limits, of course), or take a guided jet ski tour.  When conditions are ideal, you can sign up for kite surfing lessons. Lastly, there are snack bars, restaurants and boutique shops to explore.  The other top beaches are mostly linked to resorts such as Le Meridien Bora Bora and Conrad Bora Bora Nui, among others.  Eat, Eat, Eat!  Whether you just want a snack or a five-star meal, you’ll find it all in Bora Bora.  Visitors recommend trying the fish, as it is the freshest they’ve ever tasted. One former guest wrote, “Go for ocean fish, rather than lagoon fish. Poisson Cru is a favorite Polynesian dish of tuna marinated in lime and coconut. It’s delicious and healthy.”  The resorts have plenty of restaurants, but try to support the local eateries when possible.  Story continues  Surf’s Up  As far as surf spots go, there’s Teavanui Pass, which you’ll have to access by boat. The second is Motu Piti Aau. Whichever you choose, you’ll definitely want to have an experienced guide on hand.  So, when is the best time to surf? The Surf Atlas suggests March, April, May and June—the dry season months. The publication, which offers surf reviews, writes, “This is high time for big SW groundswells in the South Seas, which is precisely what you need to filter through the reefs around Teavanui Pass.”  However, within French Polynesia, some surfers say that Tahiti offers better surfing than Bora Bora. You be the judge.  Hiking and Mountain Climbing  In addition to water, snacks and sunscreen, make sure you have your camera with you during your hike. And a guide—that’s the most important part.  Mount Otemanu is the highest point on the island at approximately 2,400 feet above sea level. Like the Pitons of St. Lucia, it can add drama to your photos.  Please note that you won’t be able to reach the summit. However, Viator notes, “Experienced hikers can explore the base of the mountain in the company of a guide, and you can also explore the lower parts of the mountain in a 4-wheel-drive vehicle or see it from above on a helicopter tour.”  If you want to climb a mountain, try Otemanu’s sibling: Mount Pahia. You’ll not only earn bragging rights once you’ve reached the top, but you’ll enjoy jaw-dropping views. Again, make sure you have that camera!  If proper hikes and mountain climbing sound too strenuous, a long, head-clearing walk on the beach is always an option."

Shaken families have been huddling at home, with civilian houses becoming the collateral damage in the gun battles raging on the streets between the forces of army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and the head of RSF, Mohamed Hamdan “Hemedti” Dagalo.  Residents of Khartoum have endured weeks of desperate food shortages, power blackouts, communications outages and runaway inflation. Before the fighting erupted on April 15, the city of five million was considered a place of relative stability, but now shelling and air attacks are witnessed frequently.  Charred aircraft lie on the airport tarmac, foreign embassies are shuttered and hospitals, banks, shops and wheat silos have been ransacked by looters.  Violence also renewed in El Geneina, the capital of West Darfur state, leaving hundreds killed and the health system in “total collapse”, medics said.  Fighting continued on Monday, with loud explosions heard across Khartoum and thick smoke in the sky while warplanes drew anti-aircraft fire, according to witnesses.  “The situation is becoming worse by the day,” said a 37-year-old resident of southern Khartoum who did not wish to be named because of safety concerns.  “People are getting more and more scared because the two sides … are becoming more and more violent.”  Another witness reported “clashes with various types of weapons” in Omdurman, the capital’s twin city.  Nearly a million people have been displaced by the conflict, many of them taking shelter in Port Sudan about 850 kilometres (500 miles) away.  The United Nations says more than 700,000 people have been internally displaced by the fighting, and nearly 200,000 have fled Sudan for neighbouring countries.  There are fears for the stability of the wider region.  “We’re left on the street, in the sun,” complained Hamden Mohammed, who escaped the Khartoum area for Port Sudan. “We want the organisations to evacuate us from Sudan, because the country is totally devastated. There’s no food, no work … nothing.”  About 1,000 people have been killed, mainly in and around Khartoum as well as the ravaged state of West Darfur, according to medics."

The Ukrainian army is now not only capable of striking Crimea—Russia’s central concern in the war—but deep into the Russian mainland. It takes delivery of these weapons on the eve of a long-anticipated counteroffensive against Russian lines.  In these circumstances, all that has prevented a direct war breaking out between Britain and Russia is the Kremlin’s restraint, fearing the triggering of NATO’s collective defence clause.  At every stage of the war, Britain has led NATO’s escalation. Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg announced last week that the war in Ukraine “didn’t start in 2022. The war started in 2014.” This dates the beginning of NATO’s “biggest reinforcement of our collective defence since the end of the Cold War” to the Maidan coup sponsored by the US and European powers to instal an anti-Russian regime in Kiev.  The events led to the Russian annexation of Crimea and the eruption of civil war in Ukraine over the breakaway of regions in the East. The situation was formally addressed by the Minsk Agreements which were portrayed as a peace effort. Last December, former German Chancellor Angela Merkel admitted that this was only a cover “to give Ukraine time… to become stronger.”  From that point, British imperialism was central in carrying out a joint programme of training and equipping the Ukrainian army while staging repeated anti-Russian provocations—most notably the 2019 allegations that Moscow had poisoned double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia with novichok.  The UK’s war preparations  Under Operation Orbital, begun in 2015, Britain had already trained 22,000 Ukrainian troops in the seven years before the Russian invasion. It has since trained a further 14,000. In the lead up to the war, thousands of British soldiers were deployed in Eastern Europe on permanent missions or for large-scale NATO combat exercises.

[AP Photo/Frank Augstein]  The UK played a central role in NATO’s aggressive posturing from the Baltic to the Black Sea. In June 2021, a British warship entered waters claimed by Russia near Crimea, in an incident that nearly resulted in a direct exchange of fire between UK and Russian forces.  The UK’s actions have been accompanied by statements from leading military and political figures making clear Britain’s hostile intentions towards Russia.  In 2016, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon told Parliament’s Defence Select Committee that the UK would be ready for war with Russia by 2018. That year, Chief of the General Staff Sir Nick Carter declared that this included “project[ing] land capability over distances of up to some 2,000 km… copying what the Germans did very well in 1940”. Carter was referring to the preparation by Nazi Germany for Operation Barbarossa—the 1941 war of annihilation against the Soviet Union, recognised as the most brutal military campaign history has ever seen.  The 2021 Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy warned of the acute threat posed by Russia, as well as China, Iran and North Korea, and centred on increasing nuclear warhead capacity by 40 percent. In “Defence in a Competitive Age” the Ministry of Defence described Russia as “the greatest nuclear, conventional military and sub-threshold threat to European security.”  After the Ukraine war broke out in February 2022, a spokesperson for Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the UK was taking measures “to bring down the Putin regime.” New army chief General Patrick Sanders declared that the “British Army must be prepared to engage in warfare at its most violent.”  The Integrated Review Refresh 2023 is introduced by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak with the declaration, “What has changed is that our collective security now is intrinsically linked to the outcome of the conflict in Ukraine.”  Integrated Review Refresh 2023 [Photo: Open Government Licence v3.0]  Britain supplied £2.3 billion of military assistance to Ukraine in 2022, with a commitment to match that figure in 2023. Thousands of UK troops have been dispatched to Eastern Europe to participate in NATO exercises involving tens of thousands of soldiers and advanced weaponry. UK special forces troops have been deployed to Ukraine, as confirmed in leaked Pentagon files.  Russia has also accused Britain of covertly sabotaging the Nord Stream gas pipeline.  The UK’s main public role since the outbreak of war has been as an outrider for the US and European NATO powers, being the first to supply Ukraine new classes of weaponry. Prior to the provision of long-range missiles, Britain also led the way with the supply of main battle tanks, sending a squadron of Challenger IIs. This was followed by Germany sending Leopard tanks and allowing other countries to send those in their armouries. The US then agreed a shipment of Abrams tanks.  Just days after confirming shipment of the Storm Shadows, now also agreed to by France, the UK used a visit by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to declare a “jets coalition” aimed at securing modern F-16 fighter jets for Ukraine.  The crisis of British imperialism  Britain’s leading role in the war, outstripping to this point France and Germany, is paradoxically driven by its economic and geopolitical weakness, which it has sought to offset through a “special relationship” with the United States.  In its 2022 Congress resolution, “Mobilise the working class against imperialist war”, the Socialist Equality Party (UK) answered the lie that the war in Ukraine was the result of a supposedly unprovoked invasion by Russia, explaining, “The war against Russia is the continuation and intensification of the drive for US global hegemony that was initiated with the first invasion of Iraq in 1990-91 and intensified following the dissolution of the USSR in December 1991,” including wars and interventions against Serbia, Afghanistan, Iraq again, Libya and Syria.  It continued:  “British imperialism participated as a chief partner in every one of these bloodbaths. The UK has long acted as Washington’s foremost ally in Europe. But since Brexit this alliance has assumed an ever more essential imperative in British imperialism’s efforts to project its global interests. Opposed by Washington, Brexit lost the UK its place within the European Union as the foremost advocate of US interests in the continent, especially in opposing German and French efforts to build a European military capability independent of NATO. This has necessitated a redoubling of London’s efforts to prove its usefulness to the White House and the Pentagon. British imperialism, amid an unprecedented collapse in its world standing, is cleaving as close to the US as possible in the hope of a share of the spoils.”  Anglo-Russian enmity and anti-communism  There are deeper historical interests and old scores involved. Relations between Russia and Britain have been hostile for centuries, despite significant periodic alliances championing European reaction, including during the French Revolutionary Wars (1792-1802) waged with the political aim of combating the spread of republicanism from France.  Anti-Russian sentiment was fuelled most acutely by the Crimean War (1853–1856), when Britain and France backed the Ottoman Empire in defeating Russia, and was deepened during the “Great Game” conflict over control of Central Asia in the latter part of the nineteenth century.  Britain and Russia found themselves in alliance with France in the Triple Entente (1907) only due to the enormous geostrategic threat posed to British by German imperialism, leading up to the eruption of the First World War in 1914.  Polish, British and French officers inspecting a detachment of Polish troops of so-called Murmansk Battalion before their departure for the front, Archangelsk 1919. [Photo: This image was created and released by the Imperial War Museum on the IWM Non Commercial Licence]  The most significant cause of Anglo-Russian enmity in the 20th century was the October 1917 Revolution, led by Lenin, Trotsky and the Bolsheviks. The seizure of power by the Russian working class in the world’s first socialist overturn of capitalism was viewed as a mortal threat by the British and international bourgeoisie. Britain led the allied armies of counter-revolutionary intervention (March 1918-October 1919) and supplied more than half the troops involved from Britain, the US, Italy, Serbia, Canada and France. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, the class struggle in Britain, above all during the 1926 General Strike, and the ever-present threat of socialist revolution fed into the ferocious anti-Russian sentiment within ruling circles.  The re-eruption of German militarism and imperial ambitions in the Second World War pushed Britain under Winston Churchill into an alliance with the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin. But as soon as the war was concluded the old enmities re-emerged with force.  Churchill, who gifted the world with the term “the Iron Curtain” at a speech in Fulton, Missouri in March 1946, had urged Washington to continue the war after 1945 against the USSR. “Operation Unthinkable” centred on a proposed July 1, 1945 assault by British, American, Polish and German Nazi forces against the Red Army. It was never implemented because the US was focused on the war against Japan, while Churchill was driven from office in the July 1945 general election that swept Labour to power.  Churchill in the Roman amphitheatre of ancient Carthage to address 3,000 British and American troops, June 1943 [Photo: Unknown author - Unknown source]  While leader of the opposition, Churchill met with former-US army officer Julius Ochs Adler on April 29, 1951, at the height of the Korean War, where he proposed that an ultimatum be delivered to Stalin once he was again prime minister, threatening to “atom bomb one of 20 or 30 cities”, to be followed by “if necessary, additional ones.”  Putin’s nationalist regime emerged out of the restoration of capitalism in 1991, the culmination of the Stalinist counter-revolution against October and the perspective of world socialist revolution on which it was based. Nevertheless, despite the entirely opposed nature of Putin’s government of capitalist oligarchs to Bolshevism, it is impossible to fully appreciate the extent of the UK’s hostility to Russia outside of the historic legacy of anti-communism and bitterness towards the Russian Revolution’s inspiration of anti-colonial struggles in which the British ruling class has been steeped from birth. It is an impulse ultimately rooted in class antagonisms; a hatred of the working class and socialism, shared by the upper middle class, felt so deeply that it is driving the ruling elite to contemplate war with a nuclear power that could end human civilisation.  Labour and the Tories: A single party of war  With Britain being dragged to the precipice of war with Russia, there has been no popular discussion of the consequences thanks above all to the unanimity between the Tories and the Labour Party. Sir Keir Starmer leads one half of a single, joint party of war sitting across both sides of the House of Commons.  At its latest conference, Labour delegates passed a motion submitted by the GMB trade union calling on the party to support the provision of military, economic, diplomatic, and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, for the party to back an increase in funding for UK defence manufacturing, and supporting a long-term strategy to “tackle Putin and dictators around the world” and for the party to back an increase in funding for UK defence manufacturing.  Sir Keir Starmer, the leader of Britain's Labour Party makes his speech at the party's annual conference in Liverpool, England, September 27, 2022. [AP Photo/Jon Super]  Labour’s shadow foreign and defence secretaries David Lammy and John Healey have written in Foreign Policy magazine, “The next Labour government will ensure Britain is NATO’s leading European nation. We would apply a ‘NATO test’ to major defense projects within our first 100 days to ensure we are on track to fulfil our obligations to the alliance in full and review any capability gaps.”  These warmongers were handed leadership of the Labour Party by Jeremy Corbyn’s successful campaign to block a move by the membership to kick out the Blairites while he was in charge. The Corbynites have since either fallen silent on the war in Ukraine or, like his shadow chancellor John McDonnell, have lined up behind British imperialism and NATO.  War and the class struggle  The UK is above all driven on the path of war by acute social tensions and an eruption of class struggle at home.  Britain’s economic crisis and striving for global position dictates a brutal offensive against the working class, slashing wages, imposing speed ups and destroying social services under conditions of the worst cost-of-living crisis since the Second World War. In turn, militarism and war demands ever more draconian attacks, with the Royal United Services Institute hailing “the end of the peace dividend” such that Britain’s military spending must be prioritised over the “growing share of its national income devoted to the NHS and state pensions”.  The SEP’s 2022 Congress resolution noted:  “The catastrophic impact falls upon a society already torn by extreme levels of social inequality and widespread deprivation. Faced with a growing oppositional movement in the working class, the British ruling class is turning to war as a means of enforcing a false ‘national unity,’ with repeated calls for sacrifice from the government to justify massive hikes on the price of fuel, food and other essentials.”  The result has been a strike wave ongoing since last summer, with more than 2.8 million days lost during the winter months, the highest in three decades, and more than half a million in March alone. Sabotage and betrayals by the trade union bureaucracy of the fight by NHS, education, postal and rail workers have been vital in policing opposition, at the cost of undermining the union leaders in the eyes of millions. But the government is moving to ever more naked state repression, exemplified by the new anti-strike Minimum Services Levels Bill, set to become law on May 22.  Striking rail workers picketing during the UK wide national rail strike at the Cowlairs maintenance depot in Springburn, north Glasgow, June 25, 2022 [Photo: WSWS]  The war policy of British imperialism finds its only opposition in the working class, whose lives are being ruined and who face the prospect of death on an unimaginable scale.  But, as the SEP’s 2022 resolution warned:  “While there is enormous opposition to war among British workers, this opposition lacks a programme, perspective and leadership. The task of the Socialist Equality Party is to develop within the working class and its vanguard an understanding of the inextricable connection between war abroad and exploitation and repression at home, and in this process build a revolutionary leadership in the working class”.  Only with this perspective can workers and young people internationally fight to bring the madness of war with Russia to an end."

This flyby will mark the closest encounter with Io to date, with Juno passing at an altitude of approximately 22,060 miles (35,500 kilometres). As Juno enters the third year of its extended mission to explore Jupiter’s interior, it will also venture into the ring system where several of the gas giant’s inner moons reside.  With 50 previous flybys of Jupiter under its belt, Juno has already collected valuable data during close encounters with three of Jupiter’s four Galilean moons: Europa, Ganymede, and now fiery Io. Io is known as the most volcanic celestial body in our solar system, making it an intriguing target for scientific study. By observing Io over multiple passes, scientists hope to gain insights into the behaviour of its volcanoes, including eruption frequency, brightness, temperature, and the evolving shape of its lava flows.  - Advertisement -  Scott Bolton, the Juno principal investigator from the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, emphasizes the significance of studying Io over time: “We may observe it over time on several passes to see how the volcanoes evolve, including how frequently they erupt, how bright and hot they are, whether or not they are connected to a group or erupt on their own, and whether or not the shape of the lava flow changes.”  Io, slightly larger than Earth’s moon, experiences constant gravitational pulls from both Jupiter and its neighbouring moons, Europa and Ganymede. These gravitational forces subject Io to continuous stretching and squeezing, contributing to the frequent volcanic eruptions observed on its surface.  - Advertisement -  While Juno’s primary mission focuses on studying Jupiter, its advanced sensors, including JunoCam, JIRAM (Jovian InfraRed Auroral Mapper), SRU (Stellar Reference Unit), and MWR (Microwave Radiometer), have provided a wealth of data on Jupiter’s moons. During this flyby, these instruments will specifically investigate Io’s volcanoes to understand how volcanic activity interacts with Jupiter’s powerful magnetosphere and auroras.  Scott Bolton further reveals Juno’s future plans for Io: “Before our twin flyby rendezvous with Io in December this year and February next year, when we fly within 1,500 km of the surface, we will be even closer thanks to our future flybys in July and October. Each of these flybys offers awe-inspiring images of this incredible moon’s volcanic activity. It should be incredible data.”  - Advertisement -  Juno has spent over 2,505 Earth days orbiting Jupiter and has travelled more than 510 million miles (820 million kilometres). Since its arrival at Jupiter on July 4, 2016, the spacecraft has continuously expanded our understanding of the gas giant. Juno’s recent flyby of Ganymede on June 7, 2021, reduced its orbital period to 43 days. Subsequent flybys of Europa and Io will further refine the spacecraft’s orbit, eventually settling at a fixed 32-day orbital period.  Matthew Johnson, Juno’s acting project manager at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, highlights the mission’s broader scope: “Io is only one of the celestial bodies that Juno is continuing to study throughout this long journey. In addition to continuously altering its orbit to provide new views of Jupiter and flying close to the planet’s nightside, the spacecraft will thread a needle between some of Jupiter’s rings to gain further insight into their formation and makeup.”  NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, manages the Juno mission on behalf of the principal investigator, Scott J. Bolton, from the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. Juno is part of NASA’s New Frontiers Program, overseen by the agency’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington and managed at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. The spacecraft was constructed and is operated by Lockheed Martin Space in Denver.  As Juno inches closer to Io, scientists eagerly await the treasure trove of data that will shed light on the mysteries of this volcanic moon and deepen our understanding of Jupiter’s complex system.

The National Football League’s move to provide more exclusive game rights to streaming services continued yesterday with the league announcing that Peacock this season will host the first-ever exclusive live streamed NFL Playoff game.  “We are excited to work with a great partner in Peacock to present the first-ever exclusively live streamed NFL playoff game this upcoming season,” added Hans Schroeder, NFL’s executive vice president and chief operating officer of NFL Media. “Expanding the digital distribution of NFL content while maintaining wide reach for our games continues to be a key priority for the League, and bringing the excitement of an NFL playoff game exclusively to Peacock’s streaming platform is the next step in that strategy.”  The NFL has indeed expanded the digital distribution of ‘NFL content’ over the last 18 months. Amazon’s Prime Video streaming service is now the exclusive home of Thursday Night Football games; Peacock this season will host one exclusive regular season game (December 23 between the Buffalo Bills and Los Angeles Chargers); and ESPN+ will have another exclusive regular season game on October 1 from London between Jacksonville and Atlanta.  Plus, the NFL last December awarded Google the exclusive rights to the NFL Sunday Ticket after being carried exclusively by DIRECTV for 28 years.  The online-only games will be available on local stations in the markets where the teams play as well as the NFL+ mobile service. But some fans on social media yesterday expressed their disappointment that they will have to subscribe to multiple services to watch all the games, particularly a playoff contest.  “Greed over access. No value to fans. This is mostly to help the mediocre Peacock streaming service,” tweeted ‘Dean Lamb.’  “If anyone puts a Ravens playoff game on Peacock I’ll lose it,” added ‘JReynolds.’  “Wait, does this mean we will have to pay for Peacock to watch this playoff game!?? I don’t want anymore apps,” wrote ‘Dominique Clare.’  Terrible l subscribe to Peacock but a playoff game ippshould not be behind a pay wall . This is a slippery slope — LA Assman (@LaAssman) May 16, 2023  That's evil! I will not subscribe to Peacock! — Dread Pirate Roberts (@Cryptotis) May 16, 2023  Peacock for a playoff game ??

Remarkably, it’s active and can still be seen oozing a flurry of mud, liquid, and gas. By studying this newly found volcano and its spewed contents, scientists believe they might be able to catch some insights into the mysteries of Earth’s interior.  Named Borealis Mud Volcano, researchers from the University of Tromsø (UiT) – The Arctic University of Norway identified the volcano earlier this month at a depth of 400 meters (1,312 feet) in the Barents Sea, located above the northern coast of Norway.  Advertisement Advertisement  In collaboration with REV Ocean, it was discovered with the help of a remote-controlled underwater vessel, named ROV Aurora, which was launched from the icebreaking polar research vessel RV Kronprins Haakon.  It’s just the second time a mud volcano has been discovered in the waters of Norway – and scientists are pretty excited.  “Seeing an underwater eruption in real time reminds me how ‘alive’ our planet is,” Professor Giuliana Panieri, expedition leader and principal researcher for the UiT project, said in a statement.  “We do not rule out the possibility of discovering other mud volcanoes in the Barents Sea. It is only thanks to good cooperation and advanced technology that we can make such discoveries,” continued Panieri.  Advertisement Advertisement  The volcano is just 7 meters (22 feet) in diameter and 2.5 meters (8 feet) in height, located within a crater that is approximately 300 meters (984 feet) wide and 25 meters (82 feet) deep. It’s thought this crater was the result of a blast of methane that erupted shortly after the last Ice Age 18,000 years ago.  It may be small, but it’s a mighty one. The volcano spews out a cocktail of water, gas, and fine sediments that likely originate several hundred meters to a few kilometers beneath the seabed. As such, the researchers say the composition of this slurry could offer a “direct window” into the depths of Earth’s interior.  The submarine volcano is home to a unique ecosystem that includes sea anemones, sponges, carnivorous sponges, starfish, corals, sea spiders, and crustaceans, not to mention a host of bacteria.  “Exploring the seabed and discovering new methane insights is like finding hidden treasures. It is full of surprises. We have found thousands of such insights. Nevertheless, every time we go down to the seabed, we get the feeling that we have just begun to understand the great and incredible diversity of such insight systems,” explained Professor Stefan Buenz, who worked on the project."

These geological formations are proof of how dangerous but alluring nature can be. And you don’t even have to leave the country to witness these rocky marvels! India has a total of seven volcanoes, one of which is still active. Five of these are either dormant or extinct, and one is a mud volcano. Here are seven volcanoes that you’ll find in India!  1. Barren Island, Andaman Islands  Located on the Andaman Islands, this is the only active volcano in India. The latest eruption at the volcano was on the 2nd of May, this year. During the eruption, hot ash was spewed which spread 4.6 kilometres wide.  2. Baratang Island, Andaman Islands  This is an active mud volcano. A mud volcano is a landform which is created when slurry, mud, is spewed to the surface along with gas. It doesn’t spew lava like regular volcanoes. In other parts of the world, people enjoy mud baths at some mud volcanoes.  3. Narcondam Volcano, Andaman Islands  Another volcano in the Andaman Islands, it is classified by the Geological Survey of India as a dormant volcano. Regardless, the place still witnesses a high number of footfall each year.  Also Read: This Man Becomes The First To Skydive In & Out Of An Active Volcano; Breaks Records  4. Dhosi Hill, Haryana  Dhosi Hill in Haryana is an important site from the Vedic period. It is an extinct volcano and people love visiting it every year. In case you were wondering, the difference between a dormant volcano and an extinct volcano is that it is unlikely that an extinct volcano will erupt in the future. However, dormant volcanoes are just those that haven’t erupted for a long time but may still erupt in the future.  5. Tosham Hill, Haryana  This particular volcano is one of the extinct volcanoes in the country. Given that the volcano existed a long time ago, the ring of the volcano is now buried under the soil of the later years.  6. Loktak Lake, Manipur  One of the most beautiful lakes in the country, and possibly in the world, Loktak Lake is a volcanic caldera. A caldera is a depression formed after the emptying of the magma chambers. The Loktak Lake is uniquely is formed and is a sight to behold.  7. Dhinodhar Hills, Gujarat  Another extinct volcano, this relic of a bygone era is definitely worth visiting. You can still see its volcanic plug. The plug or the neck is formed when the magma hardens in the vent of an active volcano.

Skeletons found in Pompeii ruins reveal deaths by earthquake, not just Vesuvius’ ancient eruption  MILAN (AP) — Archeologists in Pompeii have discovered two skeletons that they believe were men who died when a wall collapsed on them during the powerful earthquakes that accompanied the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79. Experts said Tuesday that the find underlines that many of the dead in the ancient city were due to powerful quakes that accompanied the eruption and not just victims of the volcano’s deadly ash and gas. The two skeletons were found in the House of Chaste Lovers beneath a wall that collapsed before the area was covered in volcanic material. The director of the Pompeii archaeological site said new techniques are allowing experts to determine the dynamics of deaths down to the final seconds.

Their bodies were found along one side of a utility room, buried beneath a collapsed wall.

After further examination, it became clear that the two individuals had likely died as a result of multiple traumas caused by the partial collapse of the building.  © Parco Archeologico di Pompei The two skeletons were found crushed beneath a collapse wall in the ruins of Pompeii. The two skeletons were found crushed beneath a collapse wall in the ruins of Pompeii. Parco Archeologico di Pompei  The eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD destroyed Pompeii in just over 24 hours, killing an estimated 15 to 20 percent of the city's population. The area was smothered in volcanic ash, which buried the Roman city for centuries.  The ruined city lay unseen and untouched until it was rediscovered in 1748 by a surveying engineer. Together with accounts from the time by Pliny the Younger, archaeologists have been able to piece together a rough timeline of the eruption, as well as a snapshot into Roman life.

Two weeks later, Nelson is still in the University of Utah Burn Center after being diagnosed with Stevens-Johnson syndrome, a rare, serious disorder that causes the skin to burn from the inside out and could leave her blind.  Not only is the once active woman in extreme pain that has kept her constrained to a hospital bed with a feeding tube, she has undergone surgery on her eyelids to stop the risk of losing her of vision - and is suffering from panic attacks about what happens next, her family said.  Nelson is expected to be in the burn unit for several weeks, where she is being treated for severe burn-like reactions on 30 percent of her body. She also faces weeks of physical and mental therapy before she is able to work again.  Kayla Nelson, 23, was diagnosed with a rare, serious disorder known as Stevens-Johnson syndrome after taking the drug Lamotrigine for her anxiety  Nelson is still at the University of Utah Burn Center where she is in extreme pain that has kept her constrained to a hospital bed with a feeding tube, unable to walk, talk, eat, or even see  Even after Nelson is released from the burn unit in several weeks time, she still faces a long road to recovery after what her mother Lindsey Ewing called a 'horrific' experience.  'It's a lot on a 23-year-old because she's just getting going with her life,' Ewing said. 'She has her life in front of her but now we have to deal with this, just because she wanted to get her mental health stabilized.'  Ewing said that while she is grateful for how the medication has helped some with their mental health, she still wants to warn others about the potential risks associated with this medication.  'Why have this chance of a family member or a friend or anyone go through this,' she asked. She added that her daughter's doctor did advise patients to stop taking the drug immediately if they notice a rash.  The National Library of Medicine describes the syndrome as 'a rare, acute, serious, and potentially fatal skin reaction' in which the skin detaches from the body in painful blisters and rashes on the inside and surface of the body.  Nelson is an active 23-year-old who enjoys fishing, driving around with friends, but is now unable to work, walk, or talk, and will need weeks of therapy after suffering the reaction  A GoFundMe that was created by Nelson's close friends to help with the costs of medical bills, points out that the 'reactions doesn't just stop on the outside' - and that Nelson has 'severe reactions in her mouth, throat, eyes, ears, and it is also damaging her liver.  The disease starts as a small rash, and develops into blisters, and the blisters begin to peel, leaving her with exposed tissue, and a high likelihood of infections, not to mention unimaginable pain.'  In the latest updates, on May 11 and may 12, the GoFundMe revealed that Nelson suffered a panic attack the night before she underwent eye surgery due to loss of skin on the inside of her eyelids.  'To stop the risk of injuring her eyes and loss of vision, they are going in and putting synthetic skin underneath her eyelids,' the GoFundMe said.  An update revealed that Nelson had 'received a graft of placental tissue in each of her eyes, due to the damage that has been caused in her eyelids, as a measure to keep her vision protected.'  'She wasn’t excited, but her Mother and Father gave her the comfort and reassurance that she needed to be strong and power through it,' her friend wrote in the GoFundMe update.  'The operation was very successful, and she was already looking around and pointing things out in her room, almost immediately after surgery!

The pair, believed to be two males aged at least 55, were found in recent excavations at Pompeii’s “Chaste Lovers” block of buildings.  They are believed to have been killed as an earthquake knocked down a wall in the room where they sought shelter. One of the skeletons had an arm raised as if in defence.  The earthquake struck as the huge blast from nearby Mount Vesuvius covered the city of Pompeii with thick volcanic ash, preserving the bodies of many of its residents.  To date, the remains of more than 1,000 people have been uncovered throughout the sprawling site, most recently in November 2020 when archaeologists unearthed two bodies, believed to be a young enslaved person and his possible owner.  The two newly discovered victims announced Tuesday “probably died due to multiple traumas caused by the collapse of part of the building”, the Pompeii archaeological park said in a statement.  They were found in what is believed to be a storeroom inside the “Chaste Lovers” block, where colourful frescoes and the skeletons of mules who worked the millstones for grain have been uncovered in the past.  The skeletons were found lying on their side with their legs curled up, and one wore a ring on his left hand.  Archaeologists estimate that 15 to 20 percent of Pompeii’s population died in the eruption, mostly from thermal shock as a giant cloud of gases and ash covered the city.  Protecting himself  Earthquakes before and during the eruption, as documented in letters by Roman author Pliny the Younger, also took their toll.  “Among the causes of death, the collapse of buildings, in some cases due to earthquakes that accompanied the eruption, proved to be a lethal threat,” the park said.  Pompeii’s director, Gabriel Zuchtriegel, said modern technology was helping archaeologists “better understand the hell that completely destroyed the city of Pompeii in two days, killing many inhabitants: children, women and men”.  Traces of what is believed to be a cloth bundle were found next to one of the victims, containing necklace beads and coins.  Inside the room was an amphora and a collection of bowls and jugs, while an adjacent room contained a home shrine in the form of a fresco, and a narrow bathroom with a toilet.  In the room where the men were found, part of a wall had collapsed, hitting one of the victims “whose raised arm perhaps refers to the tragic image of a vain attempt to protect himself from falling masonry”, the park said."

Enjoy this free story!  Noisy air tours would be greatly reduced over Hawai‘i Volcanoes National Park and Haleakala National Park under draft plans unveiled Monday. Read more  Noisy air tours would be greatly reduced over Hawai‘i Volcanoes National Park and Haleakala National Park under draft plans unveiled Monday.  The court-ordered plans by the National Park Service and Federal Aviation Administration use a combination of route and altitude limitations and no-fly days to reduce noise levels.  Public comment is being accepted on the draft plans now through June 16.  At Hawai‘i Volcanoes the plan would reduce air tours by an estimated 86% by authorizing up to 1,665 air tours per year using three defined routes. It would also designate Sundays as no-fly days and Wednesdays for quiet-technology flights only from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.  In addition, the plan specifies flight times from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. for non-quiet- technology flights and 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. for flights using quiet technology.  At Haleakala the plan estimates a 50% reduction in air tours and requires a complete transition to quiet technology by 2033.  The plan authorizes up to 2,412 air tours per year on only one defined route, with air tours allowed from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. every day accept Sundays and Wednesdays. Quiet-technology flights would be allowed to fly until 4 p.m. on the days when flights are allowed.  The FAA and the National Park Service aim to complete the plans by the end of the year in a schedule approved by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to comply with the National Parks Air Tour Management Act of 2000.  Ruling in 2020, the court ordered the FAA and NPS to adopt limits on air tours over 23 national parks, including Haleakala and Hawai‘i Volcanoes national parks.  The order came in response to a lawsuit by Hawaii Island Coalition Malama Pono and Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, which argued that the agencies were offering little relief from the noise being generated by air tours.  In siding with the petitioners, the court noted, “For nineteen years, the agencies have failed to comply with their statutory mandate despite Congress’s command to ‘make every effort’ to do so within two years of an application.”  Calling the effort by the federal agencies “underwhelming,” the court said judicial intervention was needed and that it would ultimately have to approve the plans.  A National Park Service report published in 2019 indicated that of all the national parks, Hawai‘i Volcanoes is the one most affected by tour helicopter flights. Ten operators reported a total of 11,376 flights per year at the Hawaii island national park between 2017 and 2019.  The same report indicated that Haleakala National Park is the fourth most affected park, with 4,757 flights in the prior year.  There was a range of proposed air tour management plans for units of the National Park System released Monday, from a complete ban on overflights to a substantial number of flights permitted.  Mike Murray, chairman of the Coalition to Protect America’s National Parks, told National Parks Traveler on Monday that he wondered why the parks in Hawaii didn’t totally ban overflights as proposed at Badlands National Park and Mount Rushmore National Memorial in South Dakota.  “We are especially glad that the NPS has identified preferred alternatives for Badlands and Mount Rushmore that would provide the ‘greatest level of protection’ for park resources and values by not allowing any commercial air tours within one-half mile of the respective park boundaries. In contrast, it is curious that NPS has identified preferred alternatives for both Hale­akala and Hawai‘i Volcanoes that would provide considerably less than ‘the greatest level of protection’ at those parks,” Murray said.  The Hawaii Helicopter Association previously said operators have invested in quiet aircraft and technologies over the past several decades and are working to ensure “responsible operations for both our residents and visitors.”  The investment, the organization said, includes a digital tracking system that addresses several areas of concern to help with regulatory compliance.  The Air Tour Management Plan, environmental assessment and related documents for each park are located online. Feedback can be submitted through the NPS Planning, Environment and Public Comment website until 8 p.m. June 16.  “An important part of the process is the inclusion of Native Hawaiian groups and individuals,” a park release said. “The agencies are consulting with Native Hawaiian organizations and other groups that have lands adjacent to Hawai‘i Volcanoes National Park, and with Kupuna (elders) and individuals who attach historic and cultural significance to resources within the park.”  Learn more  >> The Hawaii Volcanoes project website is available at bit.ly/3pzpauM.  >> The Haleakala project website is available at bit.ly/455rOsI."

Skeletons found in Pompeii ruins reveal deaths by earthquake, not just Vesuvius’ ancient eruption  MILAN (AP) — Archeologists in Pompeii have discovered two skeletons that they believe were men who died when a wall collapsed on them during the powerful earthquakes that accompanied the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79. Experts said Tuesday that the find underlines that many of the dead in the ancient city were due to powerful quakes that accompanied the eruption and not just victims of the volcano’s deadly ash and gas. The two skeletons were found in the House of Chaste Lovers beneath a wall that collapsed before the area was covered in volcanic material. The director of the Pompeii archaeological site said new techniques are allowing experts to determine the dynamics of deaths down to the final seconds.  Germany: 5 sentenced to prison for 100-million-euro jewelry heist  BERLIN (AP) — A German court has convicted five men of breaking into a Dresden museum and stealing 21 pieces of jewelry containing more than 4,300 diamonds. The defendants received prison sentences, and the longest was six years and three months, German news agency dpa reported. The Dresden state court ruled that the five were responsible for the theft of the 18th century jewelry from the Green Vault Museum on Nov. 25, 2019. Officials said at the time that the stolen items included a large diamond brooch and a diamond epaulet. The crime was considered one of Germany’s most spectacular jewelry heists in recent history. The pieces taken had a total insured value of at least $129 million.  Salman Rushdie warns free expression under threat in rare public address after attack  LONDON (AP) — Writer Salman Rushdie has made a public speech nine months after being stabbed and seriously injured onstage. He warned that freedom of expression in the West is under its most severe threat of his lifetime. Rushdie delivered a video message to the British Book Awards, where he was awarded the Freedom to Publish award on Monday evening. He said “freedom of expression, freedom to publish has not in my lifetime been under such threat in the countries of the West.” Rushdie was blinded in one eye when he was attacked at a literary festival in New York state in August. Rushdie spent years in hiding after Iran’s leader called for his death in 1989 over the alleged blasphemy of the novel “The Satanic Verses.”  More dogs could show up in outdoor dining spaces. Not everyone is happy about it  Just in time for the summer dining season, the U.S. government has given its blessing to restaurants that want to allow pet dogs in their outdoor spaces. It better reflects reality; nearly half of states already allow canine dining outdoors. Restaurants have been required to allow service dogs for decades. But it wasn’t until the mid-2000’s that states began allowing dogs in outdoor dining spaces. Late last year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued new guidance saying restaurants can welcome dogs as long as they get permission from a local authority. The FDA suggests they also require leashes and develop plans to handle dog waste.  Ex-Audi chief pleads guilty in automaker’s diesel emissions scandal  FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The former head of Volkswagen’s luxury division Audi has pleaded guilty to charges tied to the automaker’s diesel emissions scandal. The move Tuesday makes Rupert Stadler the highest-ranking executive convicted over cars that cheated on emissions tests with the help of illegal software. The dpa news agency reported that Stadler answered “yes” to a statement read in court by his attorney that said Stadler admitted wrongdoing and regret for his failure to keep rigged cars off the market even after the scandal had become public knowledge. Stadler entered the plea under an agreement that gives probation instead of jail time and a $1.2 million fine in return for a thorough admission of guilt.

At the volcano’s summit is a lava lake that lights up the night sky like a beacon. In May 2021, an unexpected lava flow came down Nyiragongo’s flank, pouring into the outskirts of the nearby city of Goma in the Democratic Republic of the Congo as residents fled in the dark.  “Volcanic eruptions cannot be prevented, so mitigation strategies are needed to reduce impact.”  Now, researchers are studying ways of educating residents about the hazards of living near one of the world’s most dangerous volcanoes. The scientists presented their research at the European Geosciences Union General Assembly 2023.  As a child in Goma, Blaise Mafuko Nyandwi grew up with the towering Nyiragongo as a backdrop and watched the red glow of its lava every night. A volcanologist at the University of Goma, he knows from experience that people living in the city still do not know how volcanoes work and may therefore be unprepared to react during future eruptions.  “Volcanic eruptions cannot be prevented, so mitigation strategies are needed to reduce impact,” said Mafuko, lead researcher of the new study. Mitigation can mean making the nearby population aware and ready to react, he added.  Goma, Democratic Republic of the Congo, sits at the foot of Nyiragongo volcano. Credit: MONUSCO/Abel Kavanagh, Flickr, CC BY-SA 2.0  With the ever present threat in the region, situated in the Virunga Volcanic Province of East Africa, Mafuko and his colleagues worked with 435 sixteen-year-old students from 12 high schools in Goma to test how well two extracurricular activities raised awareness of geological risk: playing the Hazagora board game and visiting the Virunga Volcano Museum.  Gaming and Exploring the Way to Awareness  On the fictional island of Hazagora, players develop a society regularly hit by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, floods, and landslides. Five to 10 players, representing the island’s mayor, a fisherman, a lumberjack, a farmer, and a tour guide, must figure out how to survive disasters by making trade-offs on protective measures. Players use their annual income to provide for their family’s basic needs but can also stockpile supplies and reinforce or protect infrastructure, for instance.  The Hazagora game can be used to teach people about geological hazards. Credit: Blaise Mafuko Nyandwi  The game, originally developed by researchers at Vrije Universiteit Brussel, includes information sheets on geological hazards that the moderator can use to reinforce the players’ knowledge. Through discussions about the events and possible consequences, players learn more about the natural processes at work and how to reduce risk.  “The information on volcanic risk that makes Hazagora valuable is broad,” Mafuko explained. The game could symbolize any volcanic region.  On the other hand, the Virunga Volcano Museum, which recently opened next to the Goma Volcano Observatory (GVO), features informative panels and documentaries about volcanic hazards, monitoring activities conducted at GVO, historical eruptions of Nyiragongo, and what to do during an eruption. In the center of the room is an animated 3D model of the Virunga volcanic chain.  The Virunga Volcano Museum houses displays and documentaries about nearby volcanos and how to build resilience against hazards. Credit: Caroline Michellier  “At the museum, students learned about Nyiragongo’s historic eruptions. The exhibit reinforces knowledge of volcanoes, and Virunga volcanoes specifically,” Mafuko said. “The students were introduced to volcanologists and monitoring equipment and read about volcano preparedness and mitigation measures for risks.”  Museums are useful because they help take the students out of their normal learning environment and provide good samples and tools and, often, expertise to help the students connect the dots on the topic, said Carina Fearnley, director of University College London’s Warning Research Centre, who was not involved in the study.  Through surveys and conversations, the researchers found that both the game and the museum reinforced students’ knowledge of volcanism, but the museum was a more effective tool to help students learn about how volcanoes work. The Hazagora game, on the other hand, made the students more knowledgeable about how to take protective action.  This study provided valuable insight into the success of a paired approach to learning about volcanoes, using a range of tools and types of engagement, Fearnley added.  Striking Motivation  Mafuko said he was struck by the students’ initial low level of understanding about volcanic processes and risk despite them living at the foot of the volcano. He and his colleagues did find, however, that the students were motivated to learn more and were willing to engage in disaster risk reduction activities in their school communities and with their families, Mafuko said.  “These students are the future decisionmakers and stakeholders in disaster risk reduction,” said Joseph Makundi, Goma’s civil protection coordinator. “They are powerful in influencing members of their community to adopt protective behavior.” Reaching students is therefore key to building a prepared community in Goma.  “Goma is a particularly vulnerable population for volcanic hazards, and any work that can be done to build awareness and resilience is vital.”  The work “highlights the importance of teaching hazard and risk management at schools, not just in Goma,” Fearnley said. “Goma is a particularly vulnerable population for volcanic hazards, and any work that can be done to build awareness and resilience is vital.”  Academics, risk managers, and teachers should work together to design attractive educational actions specific for their context, Mafuko suggested.  These kinds of simple educational activities may be more practical for teaching, especially in the Global South, where advanced technologies such as augmented virtual reality, which is sometimes used to raise hazard awareness, are difficult to implement. Policymakers should integrate disaster resilience into school curriculums and recommend extracurricular activities in which students can be active learners, Mafuko said.  —Munyaradzi Makoni (@MunyaWaMakoni), Science Writer  Citation: Makoni, M.

The skeletons were discovered at the excavation site known as the Casti Amanti.  According to Gabriel Zuchtriegel, the Director of the Pompeii Archaeological Park, the two were men working in an area that was not a luxurious part of Pompeii, possibly involved in building projects using plaster and amphorae filled with water.  He said that the bones show various fractures and are mixed with pieces of the wall that crumbled on them.

Species composition does not change, but an effect of ash deposition through reduced accumulation rates is evident, especially in the first five varve-years after eruption. In general, ash fall and volatile acids in the atmosphere directly and immediately damage terrestrial biota, and their effects tend to be larger in areas near the eruption. The unique characteristics of ecosystems in the Eastern Mediterranean may also affect their sensitivity to volcanic hazards. One of the most important natural environmental pressures in this region is drought, and steppe species are adapted to these conditions. In plants, these adaptations include thick cuticles, small leaves, deep rooting systems, and small, protected stomata43,44. Many of these adaptations are likely to benefit species in terms of resistance to volcanic impacts1. For example, small leaves trap less tephra, thick cuticles limit the effects of acid deposition, and deep rooting systems ensure that plants are less vulnerable to tephra-soil interactions. However, if plant survival depends on growing through the ash deposit, a > 10 cm deep tephra can nearly eliminate the herb layer45. In our study, the extent of plant damage cannot be reliably determined. We assume that the first post-eruption rainfall would likely wash the ash-coating on leaves off. Grasses (Poaceae) with long slender leaves are less affected, due to their ability to shed quickly any deposited ash fall46. In addition, this family has a short life cycle and benefits very quickly from the nutrients supplied by volcanic eruptions12. This profiting is reflected by relatively stable values in pollen percentages and accumulation rates of Poaceae, especially shortly prior and after ash deposition (e.g., V-18 and V-237). Eastern Anatolian steppe species (i.e., Chenopodiaceae, Artemisia) are more frequently exposed to natural disturbances (e.g., fires, droughts) and recover quickly after volcanic ash deposition or colonizing newly created open areas (e.g., V-18, V-60, V-176, and V-233a). Therefore, changes in the vegetation community and environmental conditions around Lake Van favor dispersal conditions for an increased proportion of Chenopodiaceae.  Modern environmental studies at Mount St. Helens indicate that forest vegetation appeared to be more resilient to ash cover than shrubs or grassland8. In this context, the deciduousness of trees may facilitated survival as they are adapted to leaf loss2. However, the response to natural hazards is influenced by the season during which they occur that may exert a selective force on disturbance47. We do not know at what time of year the volcanic eruptions occurred; if they occurred towards the end of the growing season when leaf-shedding would have lessened any chemical/physical damage or photosynthetic impairment, the deciduousness of trees may have contributed to them being less affected22. It should also be noted that regionally-growing deciduous oaks, predominately occurring on the southern slopes of the Bitlis Massif30,31,32,48, may have been only marginally affected by ash deposition or pyroclastic flows due to the prevailing W-E orientated wind direction26 and spatial distance to the volcanoes (more than 20 km). Regardless of morphological adaptations, it cannot be ruled out that indirect effects of volcanic eruptions such as short-term climate deterioration (e.g., reduction of solar radiation, temperature drop1,2,22) may have affected the regional vegetation at Lake Van. The minor decrease in tree cover and increase in herbaceous vegetation a few varve-years after ash deposition may also be explained by a cold shift for several years.  The deposition and incorporation of volcanic ash particles in lake sediments have effects in the proxy-dataset that are often not easily distinguished from those of natural climate changes. At Lake Van, the prevailing climatic phase (interglacial/interstadial, glacial/stadial stages) largely determines the boundary conditions for vegetation composition and also the recovery of disturbed terrestrial ecosystems following a volcanic eruption. This is impressively evident at the beginning and end of interglacial MIS 9e, where the vegetation composition following V-233a and V-237 is not comparable to its pre-volcanic composition (Fig. 2; Supplementary Figs. 3 and 5). At the transition from cold/dry glacial to the warm/humid interglacial, the deposition of V-237 triggered pronounced changes in vegetation composition, but global climate changes during the transition attenuated the tephra-induced disturbances. It is unlikely that the fallout promoted millennial-scale climatic changes, however, it potential act as catalyst in connection with long-term post-glacial recovery dynamics. In short, the ash deposition is responsible for abrupt changes in the record, with recovery strongly controlled by prevailing climate conditions leading to a vegetation shift from steppe vegetation to an oak steppe-forest. A similar phenomenon appears at the end of the MIS 9e (V-233a), where gradually cooler/drier climatic conditions affect vegetation cover, which becomes successively more open. While evidence suggests that the volcanic event is the trigger for the documented dramatic changes in terrestrial interglacial vegetation, the open oak steppe-forest was already at its ecological limit at the transition into the cold/dry stadial period. This climatic transition affected the vegetation (both AP and NAP) and even prevented it from recovering to its previous state for decades (for the 90-varve interval studied here).  Cold/dry glacial and stadial periods at Lake Van are dominated by steppe vegetation (e.g., V-18a, V-176). Reduced vegetation cover is associated with lower pollen production and thus generally lower pollen accumulation rates, especially for trees and shrubs due to unfavorable growing conditions. Such disturbed open landscapes favor visible changes in terrestrial ecosystem (e.g., increased erosion processes; low Ca/K ratio). XRF data illustrate abrupt change or a step in all measured properties between background sedimentation and volcanic deposition. Despite the lower resolution, they provide a broader context for pollen data that not only document abrupt changes in the system but serve as independent evidence of the effects of volcanic deposition on ecosystem complexities. During the volcaniclastic ash deposition V-176 (stadial phase), PARs increased due to remobilization of allochthonous material (including high proportion of incorporated volcanic ash particles) and additional input of pollen grains (airborne components) from regionally open Chenopodiaceae-dominated steppe areas. Persistent similarity between XRF (K) and palynomorph data sets suggests a depositional process that can coexist in the same volcaniclastic deposit. By our definition, we interpret here only the depositional processes, since all volcaniclastic deposits that were finally deposited by non-volcanic processes are secondary volcanic deposits. Consequently, the increase in degraded pollen following V-176 deposition can be considered as an indicator of enhanced runoff21, acid stress, mechanical damage, changing lake sediment sources, and catchment disturbances. The increased occurrence of ruderal plants (e.g., Liguliflorae, Plantago lanceolata) between V-18b and V-18a (glacial phase) indicates habitat disturbances associated with soil degradation49. A highly stressed environment and persistent irreversible cold climatic conditions significantly impair a fast recovery to its previous state7. However, the highly affected herb and shrub communities returned to pre-eruption levels within 20 to 40 varve-years and recolonize devastated areas around the volcanoes. Any long-lasting millennial-scale effects are not apparent from palynological data. This regeneration time of only few decades is consistent with similar environmental studies at Mount St. Helen (USA)8,16,17,18, disturbances by the Laacher See tephra (Germany)11,13, and at Lago Grande di Monticchio (Italy)20. In addition, similar to the studies of the two northern German lakes after the Icelandic Saksunarvatn ash, we see a possible pre-volcanic sedimentary changes in one time interval (V-60) of about −20 varve-years before the Intralake-İncekaya-Dibekli fallout (light-yellow bar below V-60; Fig. 2; Supplementary Fig. 7)22.  Response of aquatic ecosystems following volcanic ash deposition  The five investigated intervals show changes in aquatic non-pollen palynomorphs (algae and non-siliceous microfossils) in all post-event phases. Aquatic organisms respond very quickly and sensitive to environmental changes and natural disturbances, such as ash deposition, caused by their shorter life cycles. At Lake Van, aquatic microfossils react with only minor (ca 1–8 varve-years) or even without any time lag to volcanic-induced environmental and ecological changes (e.g., V-176, V-223a, V-237). The clearest example we found is a 16-fold increase in annual accumulation rates of Pediastrum, dinoflagellates, and Botryoccocus immediately in the ash-affected sediments of the Nemrut deposit V-176 (from 32 to 508 cysts/coenobia cm−2 yr−1). Chemically, Nemrut volcanic deposits (trachytes and rhyolites) are dominated by silica-saturated peralkaline rocks, and therefore many Nemrut tephra deposits have moderate to high silica content (e.g., Nemrut Formation, V-18; approx. 60–70 wt.% SiO 2 )26. The sub-alkanline Süphan rhyolites are characterized by low total alkalis and high silica content, but by slightly higher SiO 2 compared to Nemrut compositions (70–77wt.% SiO 2 )26,27. The nearly aphyric basalts of the huge, predominantly hyaloclastic İncekaya system are alumina-rich, moderately alkaline, and weakly evolved basalts that are distinctly different from other basalts of the Nemrut/Süphan system26,41. The chemical composition is much lower with SiO 2 concentrations of approx. 46–48 wt%41. The measured XRF-Si counts range from high (e.g., V-18, Nemrut) to low (V-60, İncekaya). In this study, we can demonstrate that the level of Si supply has a direct and immediate effect on aquatic ecosystems, visible through increases in the NPP accumulation rates (Fig. 2; Supplementary Figs. 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9).  The most significant effect related to chemical weathering of tephra is probably a massive, essentially instantaneous, input of silica from volcanic glass particles into the lake3. However, this particulate silica is often not immediately available to biota, rather it dissolves slowly (in particular for rhyolitic tephra) and is subjected to relatively slow settling of tephra through the water column. In addition, mixing processes reduce the sinking rate and could be important for the dissolution of tephra in the water column of large lakes3. Dissolution rates of silicates are pH-sensitive (indifferent up to pH 8), thereafter dissolution rate increased by 0.3 log units per pH unit50. These considerations may suggest that direct silica input does not provide the necessary sustained stimulus to explain the enhanced productivity of algae. However, volcaniclastic deposition in the watershed also leads to indirect changes in lake catchment nutrient cycles, for instance, a decrease in organic content (TOC). In addition, fresh volcanic ash is highly acidic, and therefore, when freshly-erupted ash comes into contact with the general very alkaline character of the Lake Van water (ca 153 meq l−1; pH 9.8)51, it has the potential for a short-term reduction in the pH and alkalinity. Such changes in the physical and chemical condition of the lake (e.g., increased SiO 2 input, diluting alkalinity, short-term reduced light availability (less than 1 year)3, sealing the sediment-water interfaces3,21, reduce recycling of nutrients from the lake sediments11) and the surrounding area have enormous effects on the aquatic ecosystem. In particular, the green algae Pediastrum requires a nutrient-rich environment, which is commonly enhanced by additional leaching effects from the ash deposits of the catchment. This nutrient supply has a fertilizing effect on aquatic organisms and thus stimulates increases in primary productivity of the lake. Intensified algae blooms are promoted by persistent delivery of tephra-derived nutrients (e.g., silica) due to high and sustained erosional processes from disturbed terrestrial surfaces (remobilization of volcanic ash), especially during the first five varve-years following the volcanic event (e.g., V-233a, V-237). At this point, it can be pointed out that the SiO 2 -depleted İncekaya deposition (V-60; low Si % values) did not cause any Pediastrum bloom, but on the contrary, the algal bloom was prevented (Supplementary Fig. 7).  However, once the tephra-induced nutrient input ended, the system re-established the conditions found during previous periods. Here, our observations are comparable to paleoecological studies at Lake Gölhisar21 (Turkey) and Holzmaar11,13 (Germany), where the volcanic fallout had fertilized Pediastrum and diatom communities. Finally, the Nemrut volcaniclastic ash deposits are a direct source of nutrients (Si %) with biological impact and feedback mechanism on aquatic organisms.  Relationship between vegetation changes, volcanic eruptions, climate, and fire frequency  Charcoal residues occur under natural environmental conditions either as a result of wildfire or volcanic processes that can ignite or initiate fires. High fire frequency is a major cause of vegetation damage and can be directly triggered by hot, fresh lava, fallout, or by pyroclastic flows that buried vegetation in the blast and proximal area. In the case of Mount St. Helens (USA), many trees buried by the density-flow deposit burned or smouldered for weeks after the eruption2,40,45,52.  Our study illustrates a direct correlation between changes in vegetation composition caused by volcanic deposits under each prevailing climatic condition and the effects on fire frequency. Charcoal particle peaks directly associated with ash deposition in all five pollen profiles indicate that widespread, concurrent and intense fires were associated with the eruption. However, the amplitude of fire intensity depends on the availability of biomass (e.g., lower during glacials, larger during interglacial periods), suggesting that charcoal particle peaks during colder periods may be diagnostic of tephra rather than climate-driven fires.  Fire activity at Lake Van generally follows global climate changes, with high fire intensity during warm/humid climatic conditions (e.g., interglacial/interstadial stages) when oak steppe-forest were abundant and provided fuel for fires36. In other words, high charcoal amounts correlate with high arboreal pollen values30,31,32. Depending on available biomass, warm/humid periods also promote fire events of understorey vegetation (e.g., V-237) rather than prolonged dry/cold periods in overall sparse vegetation cover (e.g., V-18). Distinct fire signals are observed at the beginning and end of interglacial MIS 9e immediately preceding and following volcaniclastic accumulations V-233a (mean 2124 charcoal particles cm−2 yr−1) and V-237 (mean 1059 charcoal particles cm−2 yr−1), respectively. For V-233a in particular, enhanced fires occurred during the ash accumulation in an already high charcoal level (ca 6-fold increase), but did not continue for more than one to six varve-years. Even during stadial/glacial periods, when biomass production is generally low to sustain frequent fire events (mean 279 charcoal particles cm−2 yr−1), a sudden 16-fold increase in charcoal PAR (from 64 to 1052 charcoal particles cm−2 yr−1) suggests that the volcanic deposition of V-176 resulted in a large-scale tephra-induced steppe fire.  The source area of fires cannot be precisely defined, but likely regional in extent. The hot lava, fallout, and/or pyroclastic flows may have caused fires in the immediate vicinity from the eruptive source. Since we identified mostly microscopic charcoal fragments ( > 20 to 125 µm) in our samples, we assume that the charcoal particles were transported into the lake over distances of a few kilometers, e.g., by erosional processes, increased precipitation events, or aeolian input. In association with hot ash deposits, explosive volcanoes at Lake Van may eject large amounts of fine ash into the atmosphere, leading to temporary and non-seasonal climate changes (e.g., reduced solar radiation12,13) and/or increases in lightning activity, and thus to wildfires. Lightning strikes are the most likely cause of long-lasting post-eruption fires. Exposed-standing trees and high abundance of fuel in the ash-damaged steppe-forests would increase the chances of ignition.  The sedimentary intervals containing five selected tephra deposits illustrate the complexity of cause-effect relationships following volcanic eruptions. The wide array of effects stretches from direct and immediate environmental changes to indirect and decades-long repercussions."

As KPIX reports, dozens of people rallied Monday outside Walgreens to demand justice for Brown, and then marched up Market Street toward City Hall. One of the signs being carried at the protest read, ""We saw the tape: Banko was murdered.""  The Young Women's Freedom Center, where Brown volunteered and which helped organize yesterday's protest, said in a statement:  We do not need to see the video to know that Banko Brown's killing was unjustified. Armed force is not a justified response to poverty. Young people, especially Black and trans youth who experience poverty deserve love, care, and the resources they need to survive and thrive. Banko deserved to live.  It seems likely there could be some disruption at today's Board of Supervisors' meeting just as there was last week, with friends and supporters of Brown continuing to demand justice and looking to the District Attorney to hold the shooter accountable. The DA's office has concluded there is insufficient evidence to prove that the shooter, 33-year-old Michael Earl-Wayne Anthony, did not act in self-defense. He has claimed that he feared for his life.  With Monday's announcement came the release of surveillance video, a video of the interrogation of Anthony, and the DA's Office investigative report on the case. And reaction to the video has been predictably loud and swift, as it does not seem to satisfy many people on the question of whether the shooting was justified.  The video shows Anthony tussling with Brown near the door of the Walgreens at 825 Market Street, just after Anthony tried to stop Brown from exiting the store with allegedly stolen merchandise. Following some struggle, in which it's clear that Anthony can easily physically overpower the smaller Brown, Anthony lets Brown go and pushes him out of the store. Brown can be seen edging back into the store — witnesses say he intended to spit at Anthony — and after a slight lunge with his chest forward, we see Anthony raise his gun and take a shot, and Brown falls backwards outside the store.  During questioning by police, Anthony says that Brown began threatening to stab him while they were struggling on the ground. And having not frisked Brown, Anthony says he did not know what Brown might have on his person or what he might do if he was let go.  The full interview can be seen below, via the DA's office and ABC 7 — and Anthony and the police misgender Brown throughout, referring to him as female. It later became publicly known that Brown was trans and identified as male.  Anthony says he was primarily trying to subdue Brown and had him a choke-hold position at one point, saying he would release him if he calmed down.  Anthony also admits that he carries two guns on the job, and that he used to carry pepper-spray, however that was ""confiscated"" at some point, possibly by Oakland police. (Anthony just says he lives in downtown Oakland.) None of these items are provided by the security firm Anthony works for — he says that what they provide to guards is ""just a t-shirt.""  Anthony said the day that this incident occurred at the Walgreens, the firm, Kingdom Group Protective Services, had put out a notice to all employees that they should engage with shoplifters in a ""hands-on"" manner and prevent them from leaving stores with stolen goods.  As Jenkins said in a press conference Monday, per the Chronicle, the question of how guards or police should handle shoplifters remains an open one.  ""It’s a conversation that needs to be had amongst everybody involved — us as consumers, the stores, leaders … about the serious implications of both unarmed and armed security. I think it’s one that we need to have at this moment,"" Jenkins said.  Supervisor Aaron Peskin told the Chronicle that he plans to introduce legislation today calling on California Attorney General Rob Bonta and the federal Department of Justice to investigate the case.  ""This is not who we are. Stealing a bag of candy does not warrant the death penalty. I understand people are afraid of crime, a fear being stoked by too many politicians and their political allies,"" Peskin said, per the Chronicle. ""But this is not a choice between justice and safety — we can have both. And allowing what appears, at a minimum, to be an unjustified shooting does not make us safer. It does not make us better. It should make us ashamed.""

DOI: 10.1029/2022JB026114  New Zealand research could help track the path of searingly hot rock and gas flows that are the world's most deadly volcanic hazard.  Te Whare Wānanga o Waitaha | University of Canterbury School of Mathematics and Statistics Lecturer Dr. Leighton Watson has for the first time shown that seismic signals—ground shaking recorded by seismometers—can be used to track pyroclastic flows, which can travel at up to 500 kmh (310 mph) during a volcanic eruption.  The catastrophic eruption at Whakaari White Island in 2019 caused a pyroclastic surge of gas and rock that killed 22 people, while an earlier eruption of Te Maari craters in 2012 on Mt. Tongariro also caused pyroclastic flows, resulting in the closure of the Tongariro Alpine Crossing. Around the world more than half of all volcano-related deaths are caused by pyroclastic flows.  Dr. Watson says these ""terrifying"" flows are challenging to study because they are sudden, fast-moving, and dangerous. ""It's hard to know what is going on inside a flow because the internal flow dynamics are hidden by an opaque gas cloud which is impossible to see through.""  However, he has used seismic data recorded by a permanent monitoring network at Mt. Etna, Italy, to track a pyroclastic flow that happened in February 2014. His findings have been published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth.  ""We've shown that as the pyroclastic flow travels down the flanks of the volcano, it pushes on to Earth's surface producing seismic waves. We can use these seismic signals to track the flow, potentially informing modeling of their flow paths in real time which could help with making hazard assessments for future eruptions.  ""By considering how seismic signals get smaller further away from the pyroclastic flow, we can locate the source of these vibrations and track their location over time.""  He says because of the extreme hazard posed by pyroclastic flows there is an urgent need to improve monitoring capabilities. The findings could be applied at volcanoes in New Zealand such as Ruapehu, Tongariro and Taranaki.  ""All of the New Zealand volcanoes are able to produce pyroclastic flows, so being able to monitor them better could help improve safety.""  Dr. Watson hopes to carry out further research in the New Zealand context using seismic signals to track lahars (mudflows composed of rock, debris, and water), as well as pyroclastic flows. A lahar from Ruapehu destroyed a bridge over the Whangaehu River causing a train derailment in the 1953 Tangiwai disaster that killed 151 people.  ""The ultimate goal is to better understand and monitor volcanic hazards and to use these findings to save lives. This is especially useful as volcanoes are often shrouded in cloud and eruptions can happen during the night when cameras are not effective.""  Dr. Watson has already shown that sound waves can be used to detect mountain avalanches along the Milford Road and is currently working on monitoring avalanche activity in Mount Cook Aoraki National Park.

This map shows the locations of two M5+ earthquakes and numerous aftershocks in and around Lake Almanor, CA, from 11-16 May 2023. The earthquakes are associated with normal Basin and Range province faulting, and there are numerous fault zones under and around the lake which could be the source of the sequence. USGS graphic by Jessica L. Ball.  The initial M5.5 earthquake (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/nc73886731/executive) was followed by a M5.2 quake (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/nc73887046/executive) as well as dozens of smaller aftershocks. Because Lake Almanor is close to Lassen, CalVO received many questions about potential connections to the volcano.  To start, the distance and character of these earthquakes tell us that they're unlikely to have anything to do with Lassen. Focal mechanisms (a way of describing the type of slip) tell us that these earthquakes occurred on a normal fault. At a volcano, we would expect seismicity to have widely varying focal mechanisms, depending on earthquake location. Volcanic earthquakes also follow a more complicated pattern than mainshock-aftershock sequences (https://www.usgs.gov/observatories/hvo/news/volcano-watch-aftershock-forecasts-let-you-know-what-expect-after-large)  Our next clue is that Lake Almanor is not in the same physiographic province (defined by tectonics, landforms, and volcanism) as Lassen. The Lassen Volcanic Center is at the southern end of the Cascades Volcanic Arc, formed by a subduction zone. But only a few miles to the east are the Modoc Plateau and Basin and Range provinces. Lake Almanor falls roughly within the Basin and Range, and its tectonic history is very different from Lassen's. The area contains several N-S and NW-SE trending fault zones, including the Lake Almanor fault, which are active and prone to earthquakes. A similar earthquake sequence happened there in May of 2013 (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/nc71996906/executive).  Finally, many of you asked if these earthquakes could affect Lassen. The short answer is no! While some eruptions might be triggered by large earthquakes, it only seems to happen when the volcano is already primed and ready to erupt - that is, there already needs to be gassy magma near the surface. We've seen no evidence of that at Lassen recently: no earthquake swarms, no ground swelling, and no change in the gases coming out of the volcano.  So there you have it - while these earthquakes were near Lassen, there's no danger of eruption. It's just part of living in a tectonically active state!  "

Volcanologist Professor Silvio De Angelis from the University of Liverpool will present the talk where he will delve into the geological and eruptive history of the Hunga volcano, the factors that drive terrestrial and submarine volcanism, and control its explosivity.  The organisers will also present some unique geophysical observations associated with this extraordinary explosion and compare it to other large historical events such as the 1883 Krakatoa eruption.  This Hunga Tonga- Hunga Haʻapai eruption was one of the largest in the past century, and caused significant damage in the archipelago and generated a tsunami. The size of the eruption was unprecedented.  The event was extensively documented by digital sensor networks on the Earth's surface, as well as from space. The eruption column reached a height of 55 km; the atmospheric pressure waves associated with the explosion circled around the Earth at least six times and were recorded by thousands of instruments across the globe.  Reserve a ticket for the public talk, which is shaping up to be a very informative event at eventbrite here.

Not technically a true geyser, this eruption of water is known as a “soda pop geyser,” because the cold-water eruptions look so similar to the popular Yellowstone phenomenon.  A geyser is created when pressure from hot steam shoots a tall column of water into the air, while soda pop geysers are created when a pocket of carbon dioxide mixes with the water until the water becomes oversaturated and then bursts the water out of the opening.  Crystal Geyser (in Grand County) is erupting!💦Our division geologist monitors this site & hasn't seen an eruption in years, but this year's wet winter might have caused the water table to rise, resulting in CO2 gas that powers the eruptions to push water through. #KnowYourH2O pic.twitter.com/hWgrORxT2w — Utah Division of Water Resources (@utahwaterres) May 15, 2023  According to the Utah Geological Survey, the Geyser was discovered in 1936 when an exploratory oil well, the Ruby No. 1 was drilled. Workers encountered carbon dioxide gas deep below the surface, approximately 360 feet, which was extremely pressurized.  The well was eventually abandoned, but in its aftermath, a geyser was created.  The November 1936 front page of Moab’s Times-Independent boasted of a new geyser that spouted an 80-foot column of water at regular intervals of about 15 minutes and a 150-foot column at intervals of about 9 hours.  Today, the geyser’s eruptions have slowed down, though it’s uncertain whether that’s a result of geological changes beneath the surface or of rocks that people used to drop down into the geyser.  Because the eruptions are sporadic, sometimes more than 24 hours apart, being able to see the geyser in action can be difficult.  Studies conducted on the geyser over the last 20 years have tracked the frequency and height of eruptions using sensors. The studies found that minor eruptions ranged in height from 2-10 feet, while major eruptions gained heights of 40 -80 feet and occurred on a schedule ranging from 17 to 27 hours apart. The duration of eruptions ranged from 3-49 minutes."

They are believed to have been killed as an earthquake that accompanied the eruption of Moutn Vesuvius in 79 AD knocked down a wall in the room where they sought shelter.  Pompeii Archaeological Park Director Gabriel Zuchtriegel said the two were killed not by volcanic ash but by collapsing buildings, noting that wall fragments were found between their fractured bones.  In the room where the men were found, part of a wall had collapsed, hitting one of the victims “whose raised arm perhaps refers to the tragic image of a vain attempt to protect himself from falling masonry”, a statement from the park said.  The skeletons were found lying on their side with their legs curled up, and one wore a ring on his left hand.  They were found in what is believed to be a storeroom inside the “Chaste Lovers” block, where colourful frescoes and the skeletons of mules who worked the millstones for grain have been uncovered in the past.  IN PHOTOS: Pompeii’s treasures go on display at reopened Antiquarium museum  Inside the room was an amphora and a collection of bowls and jugs, while an adjacent room contained a home shrine in the form of a fresco, and a narrow bathroom with a toilet.  The earthquake struck as the huge blast from nearby Mount Vesuvius covered the city of Pompeii with thick volcanic ash, preserving the bodies of many of its residents.  Archaeologists estimate that 15 to 20 percent of Pompeii’s population died in the eruption, which had a force equivalent to many atomic bombs, mostly from thermal shock as a giant cloud of gases and ash covered the city.  Pompeii’s site director Gabriel Zuchtriegel. (Photo by Andreas SOLARO / AFP)  Earthquakes before and during the eruption, as documented in letters by Roman author Pliny the Younger, also took their toll.  “At least 15-20 percent of the population” was killed, according to the park.  Over the past two and a half centuries, archaeologists have recovered the remains of more than 1,300 victims, most recently in November 2020 when archaeologists unearthed two bodies, believed to be of a young slave and his master.  “Modern excavation techniques help us to better understand the inferno that completely destroyed the city of Pompeii over two days, killing many inhabitants”, archaeologist Zuchtriegel stated on Tuesday.

It is also three times brighter than the light emitted during tidal disruption events (TDEs) caused by supermassive black holes. The explosion occurred 8 billion light-years away when the universe was 6 billion years old. Initially detected by the Zwicky Transient Facility and later confirmed by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), the event's true scale and power were recently discovered.  AT2021lwx is believed to be the result of a black hole violently disrupting a massive cloud of gas, emitting bright electromagnetic radiation as shockwaves spread through the gas and a surrounding dust torus. While similar events have been observed before, AT2021lwx stands out due to its unprecedented scale. Although not as bright as the gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A, AT2021lwx has released more energy over its entire lifetime.  To determine the explosion's distance and brightness, the researchers used multiple telescopes and analyzed the emitted light's spectrum. AT2021lwx's exceptional brightness is comparable only to quasars emitted by supermassive black holes. Surprisingly, there were no previous detections of AT2021lwx, making its sudden appearance with the brightest intensity ever recorded a unique phenomenon.  While other explanations exist, the favored theory suggests a large cloud of hydrogen or dust was dislodged from its orbit and drawn into the black hole. Additional data collection and computer simulations will help confirm this hypothesis. The team plans to study the explosion in different light wavelengths, including X-rays, to understand its temperature and driving processes.  The researchers are eager to discover more events like AT2021lwx with the help of upcoming facilities such as the Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time. Understanding these rare but highly energetic events could provide insights into the evolution of galaxy centers over time."

During the last several years, tense school board meetings where superintendents were fired erupted in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Oregon, South Carolina and Virginia.  Contributing to this tension are politically divisive issues that many school superintendents have had to navigate over the last three years, including the teaching of race, book bans and providing access to athletics and bathrooms for students who identify as transgender.  Within this tense environment, a recent study found that nearly 40% of superintendents reported being threatened or feeling threatened on the job.

Te Whare Wānanga o Waitaha | University of Canterbury School of Mathematics and Statistics Lecturer Dr Leighton Watson has for the first time shown that seismic signals – ground shaking recorded by seismometers - can be used to track pyroclastic flows, which can travel at up to 500 kmh during a volcanic eruption.  The catastrophic eruption at Whakaari White Island in 2019 caused a pyroclastic surge of gas and rock that killed 22 people, while an earlier eruption of Te Maari craters in 2012 on Mt Tongariro also caused pyroclastic flows, resulting in the closure of the Tongariro Alpine Crossing. Around the world more than half of all volcano-related deaths are caused by pyroclastic flows.  Dr Watson says these “terrifying” flows are challenging to study because they are sudden, fast-moving, and dangerous. "

One of those killed, Christian LaCour, died while trying to save others.  On Monday, his family held what they described as a celebration of life for the 20-year-old Farmersville native in a private service at Cottonwood Creek Church in Allen.  His family said LaCour was always about comforting and encouraging others to be their true selves, which is why those who attended the service were asked to wear jeans and t-shirts with their favorite musical band, cartoon, video game, movie, Sci-Fi, fantasy, comic book or anime. These were all things the family said brought joy to their son.  People also wore red and black, LaCour's favorite colors.  In a statement, the mayor of Farmersville said:  ""Despite their deeply tragic loss, the LaCour family displayed and epitomized the type of positivity, love and spirit in celebrating Christian’s life that our community, state and nation needs to bring healing and peace.  Christian was light and hope to many and remembering him will hopefully spurn us all on to love and care for each other better.""  LaCour graduated from Farmersville High School in 2021. After his senior year, he joined Allied Universal as a security guard and was training to become a supervisor, according to the company.  He was working at the time the chaos erupted at the mall. Last week, Allen Police credited LaCour for his heroic acts.  ""We must also acknowledge the bravery of Allied Security Guard Christian LaCour, who evacuated one individual to safety and was shot while courageously remaining to help others,"" said Allen Police Chief Brian Harvey in a news conference last Tuesday."

In a report on Sunday, the paper said Paris wanted to be awarded the project given its experience in similar projects in Morocco.  “But after the eruption of the current political crisis between the two countries, the China Railway Construction Corp has emerged as the likely candidate to execute this project after it successfully completed King Mohammed Bridge, the largest in Africa,” it said.  The paper said the Chinese firm had expressed desire to undertake the train project and that it has the advantage over other companies.  “What makes the Chinese company a likely candidate is the lower cost of its work and services…other advantages are that it offers guarantees to finish the project on time without any problems and that the fact that China can guarantee funding,” it added.

Toledo Fire and Rescue responded around 4 p.m.  Due to the size of the building, they extinguished the flames in a defensive stance.  This fire is far from the first incident to take place at the warehouse. Back in 2009, 20-year-old Cindy Sumner’s murdered body was found inside the warehouse.  Neighbors say since that happened the building has been a stain on the community that kids take advantage of.  “They all play in there a lot they don’t really know the true nature of how bad that building is and how there’s no structure in there. You kind of want to tell them, don’t go in there don’t do it but if their parents aren’t around to stop them, how can we,” says Ayanna, a neighbor.  Rich, the owner of Tow Time Towing, says members of his crew saw teens around the building before the fire.  “They were actually kids running out of the back, I told the cops, but they didn’t do anything about it,” says Rich.  He says he and his neighbors got lucky that the fire did not spread.  “It will burn the house down there and the building across the street and everything I got,” says Rich.  According to neighbors, they were told the building would be demolished on May 15th, but they have not seen action yet. They want to see the building gone considering as the years go by it grows more dangerous.  13abc reached out to the Lucas County Landbank, the entity responsible for the demolition, to find out the status of the project but has not heard back.

TRENTON, New Jersey (WPVI) -- Several homes were damaged after a massive fire tore through a vacant school in Trenton, New Jersey on Monday.  Calls came in around 2:15 p.m. for smoke coming from the former Junior High School #1, which later became the Martin Luther King Jr. School.  Chopper 6 was over the scene at Southard St. and Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd. as flames engulfed the property.  Firefighters eventually struck at least three alarms.  Some homes along Evans Ave. were damaged by flying embers.  Shantae Ford says the top two floors of her home are badly damaged by the fire. In one room, her daughter had equipment in storage for a new business.  ""Now I'm going to have to go out here get me a hotel for right now and find me another place to stay,"" said Ford.  A few doors up another neighbor had part of his back deck catch fire. He's one of many who say they have to leave for at least a night.  ""My daughter has asthma, my mother-in-law has breathing problems,"" said Shakur Smith of Trenton.  Residents say the school, which sat vacant for 20 years, should have been torn down a long time ago.  ""They should have been doing something with that school a long time ago. And this is what we got right here today,"" said Derrick Smith of Trenton.  According to Mayor Reed Gusciora, the building was under the control of the Trenton Board Of Education and there were tentative plans for it to be turned into senior housing.  No injuries were reported.  The cause of the fire remains under investigation."

Jayson Tatum carried the Celtics to victory with a historic 51-point performance, scoring the most points in a Game 7 ever.  Tatum broke the record that Steph Curry set at 50 when the Golden State Warriors triumphed in a first-round series over the Sacramento Kings just two weeks ago.  And as the Sixers' postseason ended, Embiid's past comments about Boston's superiority over Philly resurfaced on social media.  ""This is not a rivalry,"" the Cameroon-born big man said after the Sixers' season-opening loss to the Celtics in October 2018.  ""I don’t know our record against them but it’s pretty bad. They always kick our a**.""  The Sixers have won just 16 of 51 games against the Celtics since Philadelphia drafted Embiid in 2014.  They've lost all three postseason series with Boston during that time, falling in 12 of the 18 playoff clashes the two teams have played.  Philly hasn't beaten the Celtics in a playoff series since 1982 when they reached the NBA Finals before losing to the Magic Johnson-led Los Angeles Lakers in six games.  The Sixers started the 2023 East semifinals without Embiid, who nursed a knee injury after a first-round sweep of the Brooklyn Nets.  Still, they won Game 1 thanks to a 45-point eruption from James Harden.  With the newly-anointed NBA MVP back on the court, Philadelphia managed to push Boston to the brink of elimination with a Game 5 victory at TD Garden.  But the Celtics forced Game 7 on the road before steamrolling their opponents in the win-or-go-home clash on Sunday."

Sources said trouble began some students uploaded scenes from the Hindi movie, “The Kerala Story”, on a WhatsApp “study group” late Sunday evening with comments saying it was “worth watching”. Others in the group reacted to it saying that they do not agree.  Among the injured, four students are said to be from Jammu and one from Kashmir. They were identified as Haseeb of Bhaderwah, who suffered head injuries in the clash while four others--Arunesh, Akshit, Aniket, and Omar Farooq-- received minor injuries.  The WhatsApp conversation quickly escalated into a fight between two hostel groups that included first-year through final-year batch students. However, both sides claimed responsibility for starting the altercation, which, according to the police, also included some outsiders. The students said the seniors and some outsiders later attacked Kashmiri students. “The second attack took place after some outsiders also barged into the college at 3 am,” said another Kashmiri student.  The principal of the Government Medical College has termed the incident as ""unfortunate"" and assured students that appropriate action will be taken against those responsible to maintain peace in the institute.  “The hostel warden has given two reports of the clash and the security has also been augmented. Further, eight faculty members each for the UG and PG hostels will spend the next three nights with the students. They will have dinner with them and interact with them to know their problems,” she added.  Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Jammu Chandan Kohli said an investigation into the matter is underway.  ""There has been an incident of scuffle between some students and outsiders in GMC hostel Jammu. Cognizance of the matter has been taken and an investigation is going on,"" the SSP said.  This morning, a number of students even skipped class to protest the incident outside the GMC hospital. They wanted an investigation and demanded that the offenders be dealt with properly.

Dan passed away suddenly earlier this month at the age of 45, prompting an enormous outpouring of grief and love for a man who touched a huge number of lives with his work, his campaigning and his friendship.  Hundreds of people attended Dan's funeral on Friday at Broadgreen Jewish Cemetery before a moving service took place at the Princes Road Synagogue last night (Sunday). Dan was a leading figure in the city's Jewish community.  READ MORE: Tributes to 'extraordinary' writer and campaigner whose 'love for Liverpool was unmatched'  Dan pioneered digital journalism at the ECHO but many will remember him for his work campaigning for justice for all those affected by the 1989 Hillsborough disaster and for the unflinching support he provided to the families of those who died on that awful day in Sheffield.  This work will be noted down permanently in the records of the House of Parliament after Wirral South MP Alison McGovern paid tribute to Dan in the House of Commons last week.  Dan's other major passion was for Liverpool Football Club. His encyclopaedic knowledge of LFC and its illustrious history has been commented on by many since his death.  With Dan's commitment to the club and the Hillsborough families, it is hugely pertinent that a minute's applause at Anfield is now being organised by some of those most affected by the disaster.  Charlotte Hennessy, who was just six when her dad died in the tragedy, has been a leading campaigner for justice for the Hillsborough families. She took to Twitter to announce the planned tribute to Dan.  She said that she and Dan's friends, with the blessing of Dan's family, would like to honour his life with an applause at Anfield during Liverpool's final home game of the season versus Aston Villa, which kicks off at 3pm.  The applause will begin as the clock strikes 7 minutes and Charlotte explained that this number was chosen for a number of reasons. She said: ""For those wondering, the number 7 was particularly special to Dan. It is one of the greatest power numbers in Judaism and it was also, of course, the number of his beloved @kennethdalglish. So it felt the most fitting to Dan.""  She added: ""Dan was a life long red who did so much for Hillsborough families/survivors.""  Speaking about the planned Anfield applause, Dan's cousin Amos Waldman told the ECHO: ""We are delighted that Dan will get the hero's goodbye he deserves so much at a place and from people who meant so much to him. He would be absolutely stoked but probably a bit embarrassed. YNWA. RIP Dan Kay.""

Tomarchio led with five, and Collins and Trevor Sousa each scored twice with two assists.  “Top to bottom, this whole roster is loaded with talent,” Collins said. “Our chemistry over the years has definitely grown, but everyone is super unselfish. We just like to see the team succeed. Our saying is, ‘We-ball not me-ball,’ and that’s what showed today.”"

After struggling in back-to-back games, Tatum erupted for 51 points – the most in a Game 7 in history — and the Celtics beat the 76ers 112-88 on Sunday to advance to the Eastern Conference finals for the second straight year.  One game after missing 14 of his first 15 shots only to awaken in the fourth quarter in time to save their season, Tatum scored 25 in the back-and-forth first half and 17 more in Boston’s 33-10 third quarter that turned a three-point lead into a runaway.  The Celtics, who lost to the Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals last year, will face the Miami Heat in the East finals for the second straight season. Game 1 is on Wednesday in Boston.  “I was relieved just to get another chance. Our season could have been over after Game 6,” said Tatum, who broke the Game 7 record of 50 points Stephen Curry set two weeks ago. “It definitely was on my mind that I had played as bad as it could get, for 43 minutes.  “We had a saying: ‘It’s only up from here.’”  Tatum added 13 rebounds, and Jaylen Brown scored 25 points for Boston, which rallied from a 3-2 deficit in the series to keep alive their hopes for an unprecedented 18th NBA championship.  “You always come into a series with the expectation of how it’s supposed to go,” first-year Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said. “That’s not how the playoffs are.”  Tatum was subbed out of the game with three minutes left to a standing ovation from the crowd, which soon broke out in a “Beat the Heat!” chant. Miami beat Boston in six games in the 2020 East finals and the Celtics took a seven-game matchup last season.  “It’s the best time of the year,” Tatum said. “As a competitor, I love the opportunity.”  Newly crowned NBA MVP Joel Embiid scored 15 points on 5-for-18 shooting in a largely anonymous showing, and Tobias Harris scored 19 for the 76ers. The Sixers lost in the conference semifinals for the third straight year and the fifth time in six seasons. They have not gotten any farther since reaching the NBA Finals in 2001 despite “The Process” — tanking their way to four top-three draft picks in a row, including Embiid.  “I thought we had the right group. I really did,” said Sixers coach Doc Rivers, who was on the Boston bench when the Celtics won it all in 2008. “We played great all year and this loss absolutely diminishes what we did this year in some way. … I think this team is headed right. I thought we took another step this season. And then tonight I think we took a step backward. But that’s OK. That happens, too.”  Tatum started 0 for 6 in a Game 5 loss and missed 14 of his first 15 shots overall from the floor in Game 6 before making four 3-pointers in the final 4:14 to force the decisive seventh game.  He picked up where he left off, scoring Boston’s first basket and 11 points in the first quarter, 14 more in the second and outscoring the Sixers on his own, 17-10, in the third. The 33-10 edge in the third was the most lopsided quarter in a Game 7 since at least 1997.  “JT just got it going and get out of that man’s way,” Brown said. “He got it rolling, and there’s nothing they could do to stop him.”  BANGED-UP BROWN  Brown began the game with the black mask he has worn since breaking a bone in his face before the All-Star break. He took it off and soon absorbed an elbow to the face from James Harden, who was assessed a flagrant foul.  Brown continued without the mask but finished the half with cotton in his left nostril. He also played with an edge, making both foul shots and following it with a steal and layup as Boston went on a 9-0 run to erase a 35-26 deficit.  Brown also dove into the Sixers bench to save a ball, then had words with the bench after Georges Niang grabbed his leg and kept him from getting back on the court. Both players were given technical fouls.  Williams followed the commotion with a layup that tied the score 35-all.  “Nothing like a shot to the face to wake you right up,” Brown said.  WHAT’S UP, DOC?  Rivers is 6-10 in Game 7s. The 10 defeats are five more than any other NBA coach and three more than the NHL’s Mike Babcock and Bruce Boudreau. His teams are 6-16 in their last 22 chances to close out an opponent in a playoff series.  Asked if he expected to be back next year, Rivers said: “Yeah. I think I got two years left. No one is safe in our business and I get that.”  Harden also could be gone if the Sixers opt for an overhaul. He has the opportunity to become a free agent this offseason.  “We’ve got an unfinished job. We haven’t won anything and I think we’ve got the chance to win,” Embiid said. “We’ve got what it takes to win. … I still believe me and him have the chance to win. But it’s going to take more than us.”  TIP-INS  Tatum is the sixth player since 1997 to score 25 points or more in the first half of a seventh game. The last was Luka Doncic, who had 29 against the Clippers in the first round of the 2021 playoffs. Paul Pierce scored 26 for the Celtics against Cleveland in the second round in 2008. … The 10 points Philadelphia scored were tied for the fewest in any Game 7 quarter in the shot clock era."

The Metro Bus Service between Rawalpindi and Islamabad remained suspended for four consecutive days after it was shut following the eruption of violent protests after the arrest of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Chief Imran Khan.  The service was suspended on May 9 after Shamshabad, 6th Road, and Faizabad metro stations were vandalized by the protesters. The protesters also broke glasses and CCTV cameras and damaged the washrooms of the Committee Chowk Station. The protesters also looted nearly Rs 0.5 million from the ticketing booth of the Sixth Road station. The whole station and ticketing booths were destroyed.  The suspension of the metro bus service also caused over Rs 100 million in losses to the exchequer. More than 160,000 people travel in metro buses between the twin cities on a daily basis. The metro bus facility is a big relief for the working class, labourers, students, public servants and private employees who daily commute in Metro buses.  When Imran Khan was arrested on May 9, violent protests started in Rawalpindi and Islamabad and the protesters vandalized public and private properties and installations including Metro Bus Stations in the twin cities.

The most seriously injured, a female, was rescued by Anderson Police officers from the midst of the chaos who then stopped the bleeding from her wounds to help deliver the victim to a local hospital before she was airlifted to Indianapolis for more intensive care.  The oldest victims were 21 years old, the youngest was a 14-year-old boy.  ”Gunshots like a war. Like a war,” said Bobbie Taylor, owner of Sonny Ray’s, a longtime nightclub at the corner of 16th Street and Madison Avenue. “I looked out and that’s when I saw all the police down here. And the ambulance. When I peeked out the window when I heard the gunshots, I saw people running.”  Five of the victims transported themselves to Anderson hospitals.  Investigators found witnesses were reluctant to cooperate, leaving detectives to rely on pole-mounted surveillance cameras.  “Usually we get our best evidence on Facetime live, facetime posts actually showing some of the shootings,” said Madison County Prosecutor Rodney Cummings. “That’s what usually happens.”  Cummings said the same intersection was the site of another mass shooting in the summer of 2022 that left two dead among the five wounded.  ”Its crowds and kids, it really is,” said Cummings. “And kids with guns at two or three in the morning is a formula for a serious problem.”  Taylor said the violence happens in the street involving minors too young to come into her bar.  ”This is where people come and hang out,” she said. “This has been going on for years. Everybody’s got guns out here. A lot of us are scared because you see 14 and 15-year-olds walking down the street with extended clips hanging out. And as a business owner, what are we to do?”  Taylor was joined by several supporters and other business owners, police, pastors, the Anderson chapter of the Ten Point Coalition and neighbors at a rally outside the bar Sunday night.  ”I think there should be some kind of curfew called to where after a certain time, and I feel the police should be able to stop if they see somebody walking down the street and they look like they’re 10, 13-years-old with extended clips hanging out their pockets,” she said. “I feel like they should be able to stop them, ID them or whatever. They’re not old enough. Take them home, take those guns to their parents or whatever.”  Aside from Cummings, noticeably absent from the rally the night after the shootings were the political leadership of Anderson including Mayor Thomas Broderick, Jr., who recently squeezed through his party’s primary election, and the city councilor who represents Anderson’s west side, as residents debated among themselves as to a solution to the crowds, violence and disruption that they say is common several nights a week once the weather turns warm.  ”There need to be signs out here and hire enforcement and not let those big crowds congregate out here,” said Cummings as he surveyed the private parking lot where crowds and vehicles gather. “As soon as nice weather comes out on the weekends, that’s what usually happens.”"

Wapahani and Delta were in a classic pitcher's duel, locked at 1-1 after five innings and fighting for Saturday's Delaware County baseball championship at Yorktown High School. Raiders senior Gavin Lash and Eagles junior Kayden Thomas repeatedly exchanged blows on the mound, and neither offense could muster a breakthrough hit with runners on base.  Then, with two outs in the top of the sixth inning, Wapahani senior and former Eagle Daniel Blevins crushed one into the night sky and over the left field wall, erupting his team's dugout as the two-run homer gave the Raiders a lead they'd never relinquish.  ""I was just trying to put something in the gap,"" Blevins said. ""Saw fastball in, got around on it.""  ""I don't think I stopped screaming until the inning was over,"" Lash said. ""It was amazing. He hit the cap out of that ball.""  Senior Paul Fisher added a sac fly RBI in the top of the seventh frame to give Wapahani some extra breathing room, and Lash closed out his complete-game effort to top Delta 4-1 for the Raiders' second county title in three seasons.  It was a true team effort as the contest could've went either way on several occasions. Each team tallied six hits, played good defense and got top-notch pitching performances, yet Wapahani made the key plays when it mattered most.  That has, uncharacteristically, not been the case for the Raiders for much of this season. While the program has been a perennial powerhouse under 40-year head coach Brian Dudley, Wapahani began 2023 with a 9-8-1 record, a stark contrast to the team's 20-plus-win campaigns every year since 2018.  Graduating multiple key contributors from last season's regional-championship squad was a significant factor in the slow start, but Dudley, Lash and Blevins all alluded to a lack of chemistry as well.  It wasn't until two weeks ago that Dudley felt his boys ""got tired of losing"" and finally came together to play for one another. Their ""timely hitting"" is coming around, and they've won five straight games ever since.  ""We kind of were playing for ourselves to start,"" Blevins said. ""But now I think we're finally a team, and I love it.""  ""We lost to everyone in this county except Cowan in the regular season,"" Lash said. ""We have very good talent, more talent than a lot of teams do, and we are starting to finally play together and play for each other and play as brothers.""  More:Cowan wins first Delaware County softball championship in program history  Lash spearheaded Wapahani's opening and concluding Delaware County tournament victories. He tossed his first career no-hitter in Tuesday's 3-0 win against Daleville and rose to the occasion in the championship, pitching a complete game with seven strikeouts to just five hits allowed.  His lone walk and earned run came in the fourth inning with the bases loaded, a moment when the game could've easily swung in Delta's favor. The circumstances, which might've unraveled a less seasoned pitcher, only heightened Lash's focus as he tallied the final two outs of the frame to escape with the game tied 1-1.  ""I kept my composure really good and I felt completely in control the whole game,"" Lash said.  More:Delta track and field wins Delaware County title; 9 records broken overall by all teams  Dudley said that moment embodied the player Lash has become. Previously a significant piece on two of the program's best teams in recent history, Lash has developed into the steady senior presence the Raiders needed during their rough start.  Even if his statistics haven't been as eye-catching this season as in previous ones, his talent and experience gives his team an edge in key situations.  ""He's starting to understand that everybody will feed off him,"" Dudley said. ""He's kept his composure a lot better, especially this year.""  Lash and Blevins wouldn't have gotten the chance to shine, however, if not for Wapahani's comeback 5-3 semifinal win against Yorktown on Thursday, a game played two days earlier than originally scheduled due to weather.  In the original tournament format, Lash likely would've faced the Tigers instead. But with matchup moved up, sophomore Nate Luce got the start and did well, allowing three runs, two earned, over four innings.  Senior Daxton Dudley threw the final three innings in relief, allowing just one hit and zero runs. Down 3-1 after the fourth frame, his shutdown showing gave the Raiders' offense the necessary time to find a rhythm in the box and they exploded for four runs over the fifth and sixth innings to complete a comeback victory.  ""Those guys were awesome because that's a very good team,"" Dudley said of Luce and Daxton. ""Yorktown was the favorite coming in, and I pulled them aside after the game and said, 'You guys did one heck of a job,' because one through nine they can hit. We just kept them off base and kept fighting and scored at the end.""  Luce was a major contributor again against Delta, hitting 3-for-3 and making a key defensive play at shortstop. Wapahani played sound defense all evening, highlighted by senior Joe Foster's diving catch in centerfield in the second inning that stranded an Eagles runner on base.  Every play was significant against the ""good young group"" that is Delta, according to Dudley, especially since the Eagles (8-14) have recovered from a 1-8 start to this spring.  Dudley said defense and pitching have been the team's strengths all season, and Lash commended his teammates for their continued commitment to that facet of the game.  ""They really helped me out. For example, I wouldn't have had that no-hitter without some good plays that we made,"" Lash said. ""Everyone trusts each other and they play their hearts out for me.""  Wapahani has just five more games scheduled before the postseason begins, and the Raiders hope this tournament title springboards the group toward another postseason run.  The Radiers passed this test and will need to continue playing with chemistry and confidence to achieve their goals. In the short term, they'll celebrate adding another trophy to their illustrious program, one that Lash feels more proud of than than the county championship they won two years ago.  ""As a sophomore, we were very, very good, so we kind of just ran through teams, and this year we've got to work for a little bit more,"" Lash said. ""We've got to trust each other more. So it, honestly, felt better this time.""  Delaware County baseball tournament galleries  Gus Martin is a sports reporter at The Star Press.

It was so important for me to do something good in such complex and difficult days,"" said the 23-year-old Jewish judoka, after her dramatic victory in the 78 kg final over Frenchwoman Audrey Tschumeau.  It was the first time in her senior career that Lanir stood on the first place podium, and there is nothing sweeter than doing it in the most prestigious international competition. Although she was marked from a young age as a potential star, she was not able to make the long-awaited breakthrough since she won the European Under-23 Championship three years ago.  In the eyes of the Qatari audience, though, exactly at the moment of truth – about a year before the Paris Olympics – everything was released and Israeli judoka received a tremendous shot of encouragement.  The achievement came during a difficult year for the Jewish athlete. In the previous world championship she was eliminated in her first fight, and her participation in the Tel Aviv Grand Slam ended in tears after she lost in the battle for bronze. On Friday, the tears that flowed were of pure happiness. And how could she not be? She is the second Israeli woman in the sport to be crowned world champion, after her role model Yarden Gerbi did it 10 years before her.  A winning bet  Lanir is considered an attractive judoka, one who tends to take risks in matches. It can lead her to impressive wins like in Doha, or end up in a quick loss as has happened to her quite a few times. This time the bet had a big payoff: She was aggressive in all five of her bouts and showed particularly good offense. It was not a tactical style, and she did not try to extract penalties from her opponent.  3 View gallery Inbar Linor tests her gold medal ( Photo: Karim Jaafar / AFP )  Lanir was born in Yokne'am in northern Israel before moving with her family to Yehud, where she began her journey in judo. As a young girl, it was not clear what direction she would take. She loved ballet very much, but when she got on the judo mat for the first time it was clear that this was something to consider.  At a certain point her mother pressured her to give judo a chance in light of the positive feedback she received from the coaches. And so, Lanir would come to training in ballet clothes, throw a white uniform over them, and immediately become a tough warrior. Lanir says that ballet actually helped her in judo and improved her ability to move.  Lanir acknowledges that she was a hyperactive child, so she also experimented with sports such as floor gymnastics and aerial acrobatics, but judo attracted her more than anything - even though she was still in a dilemma. Her childhood coach, Shimi Assor, said: ""Inbar came to training in ballet clothes and told me that she was debating whether to quit because she was told that judo is a boy's sport. I told her that soon there will be the Israeli judo championships, and let's see what happens after that.""  In a post she published on Instagram, Lanir spoke openly about dealing with body image as a female judoka: ""I wasn't ready to lift a barbell that weighed more than 2 kg. and whose color wasn't pink. I was afraid to be muscular. I was afraid to look masculine. It was important to me to be beautiful; my dream was that the boys in the class would fight over who would invite me to slow dance at the bat mitzvah. I believed that if my hands were bigger than theirs, it would lessen my chances.""  3 View gallery Inbar Linor at the World Judo championships ( Photo: Karim Jafaar / AFP )  Lanir went on to describe the moment she decided to change course: ""My mother took me to see the Israel Senior Championships. I sat there mesmerized. The matches did not interest me at that moment. My eyes were locked on the sidelines where all the athletes of the national team were gathered. I studied every millimeter of their bodies, which of course were covered in judo suits, which made me continue my detective work at home. I memorized their names and looked them all up on Facebook. I went through photo after photo until I found one athlete who had a photo in a dress. And she looked just great. I was really surprised. She was very feminine and cute, and she had muscles, but she was really beautiful. A week later I went to the gym and started lifting weights. My arms grew bigger, and the terrible disaster I feared did not happen.""  Lanier adds that ""I continued to dress the way I like, and dress up and put on makeup, and feel feminine and beautiful. To this day, I stand in front of the mirror and flatter myself. Because my muscles are my most beautiful jewelry. So, I'm writing this post for the 12-year-old girl I was. For those girls who are debating whether to take the heavier weight because they are afraid of how their body will look. Being strong is so beautiful, and true beauty comes from within. And when you stand with the medal around your neck in the most important competition of your life, you will thank yourself for the decision to choose to be strong.""  Hard work to go pro  So, Lanir overcame her fears and found herself on Israel's national team at the age of 13. Of course, the commitment to becoming a professional judoka had a price: the competitions on Saturday, giving up the annual school trips and parties on the weekends. She was absent from high school quite a bit due to morning training, but in the end she finished her high school requirements on her own."

The Wolverines had been trading goals with No. 8 Cornell all game, neither team ever able to amass a lead greater than two. Pushed into sudden death overtime, Michigan knew it was now or never as the Wolverines fought to keep their dream-like season alive — and yet they weren’t worried.  “We tend to feel comfortable being uncomfortable,” Thompson said.  Down an elite attacker and one of its best facilitators, sophomore Ryan Cohen, and with senior attacker Josh Zawada effectively neutralized by the Big Red’s All-American defenseman Gavin Adler, Michigan needed someone to step up and score. Junior attacker and All-Big Ten First Team awardee Michael Boehm seemed the logical pick, especially coming off the hat trick that solidified him as the program’s single-season goal record holder.  Luckily for Michigan, Cornell thought so too.  Just over a minute into overtime, Boehm skirted the endline, looking for an opening and taking short jabs towards the crease. Graduate attacker Bryce Clay set a screen for Boehm behind the Big Red’s goal, rolling out to the left wing as his defender attempted to double-team the star scorer. As the defenders converged on Boehm, he whipped the ball over to Clay, who rocketed it into the pocket of Thompson. On a beautiful cut in from the wing, Thompson’s momentum propelled the ball into the net, and the Wolverines erupted from the sideline.  “It’s been a plethora of guys all season,” Thompson said. “(Michigan offensive coordinator Scott) Bieda … does a great job of going with the hot hand sometimes, and … I guess that was me today.”  Thompson stepped up at multiple moments during Sunday’s NCAA Tournament matchup, beginning in the very first quarter. With just over a minute left in the first period, he took a long shot from the wing, knotting the score up at four before the quarter break.  “(Thompson)’s the Energizer Bunny,” Michigan coach Kevin Conry said. “Not only has he contributed significantly with points and playing time, but his energy on a day in and day out basis has really boosted our roster. It’s been great.”  Three quarters later, both teams seemed to be running out of gas — except for Thompson. Notching two goals, only 36 seconds apart, to lock in a hat trick and give Michigan the lead with less than five minutes to go, he provided the jolt of energy the Wolverines had been lacking. Unfortunately for Michigan, though, Cornell found its second wind as well.  Ground balls turned into football-style runs, with bodies and sticks flying. Another Boehm goal led to him getting kneed in the head in front of the crease. The first and only penalty of the game, a holding by Michigan, was called. But neither team could seal the deal. The whistle blew for overtime just as the Wolverines managed to get the ball away from the Big Red.  “They were dog tired,” Conry said.  Thompson, living up to his “Energizer Bunny” persona, shocked Michigan back into rhythm with his fourth and final goal in overtime. The Wolverines stormed the field to the sound of The Victors echoing over Schoellkopf Field — their mythical season (and chance at a national championship) still alive.  “I think the guys have so much belief this year that … the fruits of our labors are going to come to fruition,” Thompson said.  Any garden takes time to flourish, as long as one is willing to put in the work required. Last year, Michigan did a lot of the weeding. Sunday, it was Thompson’s turn to break through the ivy and bloom. And as the Wolverines use the victory to climb higher and higher up the trellis of the NCAA Tournament, facing No. 1 Duke next Sunday, they can only hope that the season they’ve been cultivating comes up roses."

According to the statement, the Secretary-General commended Egypt’s key role in bringing the hostilities to an end, alongside the efforts of Qatar, Lebanon and the United States to reach a ceasefire.  “He calls on all sides to observe the ceasefire,” the statement continued, adding that Mr. Guterres reaffirmed the United Nations’ commitment to the achievement of the two-State solution based on relevant United Nations resolutions, international law, and prior agreements and the importance of restoring a political horizon.  “He reiterates that only a negotiated sustainable political solution will lead to lasting peace and end, once and for all, these devastating cycles of violence,” the statement concluded.  UN looks forward to restoration of humanitarian access  On Saturday, the UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, Tor Wennesland, issued a similar statement welcoming the ceasefire, commending Egypt’s efforts to help restore calm, and calling on all sides to respect the truce.  “I am deeply saddened by the loss of life and injuries, including children and women, from Israeli airstrikes in Gaza and the indiscriminate firing of rockets toward Israel by Palestinian Islamic Jihad and other militant groups,” said Mr. Wennesland, expressing his deepest condolences to the families of the victims of the violence and their loved ones.  In the wake of the ceasefire, the UN Special Coordinator said that he looked forward “to the immediate restoration of humanitarian access and all social and economic measures to support Palestinian livelihoods in Gaza.”"
