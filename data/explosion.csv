These forthcoming rules hold immense potential for the crypto landscape, with several coins poised to benefit, including notable contenders such as $Lina, $ACH, $CFX, and $COCOS.  CFX is the native token of the CryptoFights platform, while COCOS is the native token of the Cocos-BCX blockchain. Both coins are based in China and have a significant Chinese user base.  CFX was launched in 2018 and is based on the Neo blockchain. It is a decentralized gaming platform that allows users to play games, earn rewards, and trade in-game items. COCOS was launched in 2019 and is based on the Ethereum blockchain. It is a decentralized gaming platform that focuses on blockchain-based games.  Both CFX and COCOS have been successful in attracting users and developers. CFX has a market capitalization of over $1 billion and COCOS has a market capitalization of over $500 million. Both coins are listed on major cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance and Huobi.  CFX and COCOS are both promising projects with the potential to disrupt the gaming industry.  SFC’s regulations are set to instill confidence in the crypto sector  Driven by a steadfast commitment to investor protection and market integrity, the SFC’s comprehensive and robust regulations are set to instill confidence in the crypto sector. By mandating VASPs to obtain licenses, conduct thorough customer due diligence, maintain transaction records, and comply with anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) measures, these regulations are poised to create a more secure and compliant environment for all stakeholders.  Recognizing the significance of these regulations, the Hong Kong Blockchain Association has praised the SFC’s proactive approach, hailing the rules as a positive step towards enhancing the cryptocurrency industry in Hong Kong. By establishing a framework that balances innovation and security, these regulations are poised to unlock the full potential of cryptocurrencies and drive further adoption in the region.  While critics have voiced concerns about potential innovation stifling or insufficient investor protection, it is essential to appreciate that the SFC has meticulously calibrated these regulations to strike the right balance. By taking a risk-based enforcement approach, the SFC aims to target those VASPs that pose the greatest risk to investors, leaving room for growth and fostering an environment that encourages responsible innovation.  As the industry eagerly awaits the implementation of these forward-looking regulations, Hong Kong’s cryptocurrency landscape is poised for a remarkable transformation. With $Lina, $ACH, $CFX, and $COCOS among the frontrunners benefiting from enhanced regulatory oversight, the stage is set for these coins to shine and capture the attention of savvy investors seeking promising opportunities.  The embrace of these regulations by Hong Kong signifies the region’s commitment to becoming a global hub for cryptocurrency innovation. As the regulatory framework solidifies, these coins and the broader crypto market are well-positioned for a bright and prosperous future, built on trust, transparency, and investor confidence.

Responding to the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party’s National Investigation Agency probe into the blast, Banerjee said she does not have a problem with the NIA but the matter should not be politicised.  State Environment Minister Manas Ranjan Bhunia confirmed the explosion and said that the government would take steps to provide help to people affected. “We appeal to people to inform us of any illegal firecracker factories that they know of in their area… we will take strong steps against such units,” he said.  A police official said the impact of the explosion “was so massive” that the factory, which was being run from a residential building, collapsed. “It took place inside a house where the firecracker unit was functioning. An investigation is underway,” the police officer added.  Leader of the Opposition in West Bengal Assembly Suvendu Adhikari demanded the NIA probe into the blast and sought the intervention of Home Minister Amit Shah and Governor CV Ananda Bose. Adhikari said central forces should be deployed as dead bodies are being shifted illegally by West Bengal Police.  Villagers told PTI that the entire house looked like a “war zone”.

Vulcan will be the successor to ULA's Delta IV and Atlas V rockets. ULA was set up in 2006 as a joint venture between Boeing Co. (BA) and Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT). Since then, the company's Delta and Atlas rockets have been used to send more than 150 missions into orbit.  ""I expect we will see that [first Vulcan] launch sometime between summer and later this year,"" Bruno said during a streamed interview at the Human to Mars Summit in Washington on Tuesday.  ULA had initially planned for a Vulcan debut launch in May, but that was pushed back when a Vulcan rocket's upper stage suffered an anomaly during testing at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama in March, according to Space.com. The explosion was first reported by Ars Technica. Bruno subsequently tweeted that a hydrogen leak caused an explosion during the test.  Space.com reported that the upper stage that exploded was not part of the hardware for the debut Vulcan launch. ""We will sort that out, we will resolve it,"" Bruno said Tuesday.  Related:Virgin Galactic sets sights on first commercial launch  ULA undertook Vulcan rocket tests to simulate a launch day at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station last week.  Vulcan's booster propulsion is provided by a pair of BE-4 engines manufactured by Blue Origin, which was founded by Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos. ""I am very happy with my partner there,"" said Bruno.  The BE-4 engines use liquid oxygen and liquefied natural gas, a commercially available form of methane. Unlike other rocket propellants, such as kerosene, liquefied natural gas eliminates the need for expensive and complex pressurization systems, such as helium, which is in increasingly scarce supply, according to ULA.  The new ULA rocket also integrates up to six Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC) Solid Rocket Boosters, or SRBs.  Speaking at the Humans to Mars Summit, Bruno also discussed ULA's contract with Amazon to support its Project Kuiper, which will launch a constellation of 3,236 satellites into low Earth orbit. The deal, which was announced last year, will see the Vulcan rocket used for 38 launches.

These tremors were first recorded on Saturday, after the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GUES)—the official body that monitors the underground—received ""more than 60"" tips from people in Bornholm about ""earthquake-like tremors"" reported in the afternoon.  They described the tremors as deep rumbling, shaking and rattling, and changing pressure in the ear.  Initially, many falsely believed that they may have been caused by earthquakes. Seismologists had theorised that they may have originated from controlled explosions in Poland, more than nearly 90 miles (145 km) to the south.  However, on Monday, the GUES clarified that the tremors were ""not caused by earthquakes, but by pressure waves from an event in the atmosphere."" However, they came from ""an unknown source.""  ""The seismologists can report that it is unlikely that the tremors originate from a controlled explosion in Poland, which was carried out shortly before the first reports of tremors on Bornholm,"" the body known as GEUS said in a statement. Scientists develop fabric made of 'Fungi' which needs no stitching Danish media reported that police had received complaints from the public about the tremor on the eastern part of the island. The tremors also caused a crack in the wall of some of the houses. But no one was injured.  The Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland said that seismic tremors were measured at a magnitude of 2.3.  Polish authorities have said that there was intensive activity during the Anakonda23 exercise in Ustka, northern Poland, involving jet fighters and live firing of artillery munitions.  GEUS, an independent research and advisory institution within Denmark’s Ministry of Climate, Energy and Utilities, said that it had two seismographs on Bornholm that collect data around the clock.  Bornholm is home to nearly 40,000 people. It is a rocky island in the Baltic Sea, south of Sweden, northeast of Germany and north of Poland.  (With inputs from agencies)"

The game is a MOBA-like game where teams of three work to disable the opposing team’s barriers and score, akin to air hockey. Each of the 15 characters brings something unique to the table, such as Rune’s barriers that double as both goalie tools and ways to damage enemy players or Era’s powerful support tools that buff allies and debuff opposing players.  The game launched with 15 playable characters, three of which were added on the initial release oof the game after it left Steam Early Access. The game also saw console ports over the past two weeks (to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and Xbox consoles). Over the past week, Odyssey has been teasing new content, which comes in today’s big patch.  This update brings two brand-new playable characters to the game, Octavia and Vyce. Both of them also have kit breakdowns released that we’ll go over. First, Octavia; her kit focuses on buffing herself and maintaining momentum, as her Secondary ability is an infinitely stacking speed boost that extends so long as you’re hitting the Core. Her Primary ability is a projectile that deals damage and slows, making it a good disruption tool. Finally, Octavia’s Special emits five pulses that damage an area around her periodically.  You can view Octavia’s gameplay trailer below.  Comparatively, Vyce looks to be quite a powerful offensive character. She has access to a stun with an area-of-effect radius in her Secondary slot, and her Primary is a projectile with a pretty good range. Vyce’s Special ability involves her remaining immobile and charging up a big shockwave that grows in size the longer you charge it. Upon release, anything inside the shockwave takes big damage. While charging, Vyce has full knockback immunity but can still take damage.  You can view Vyce’s gameplay trailer below.  Today’s update for Omega Strikers also contains a new battle arena in the form of the Demon Dais stage. This new stage has two separate barriers in the form of large speakers on each side of the field with two barriers within. The update also has new skins for Kai, Atlas, and Ai.Mi, and some balance changes (including a full rework for Asher) which can all be read here.  We’ll continue to update as more information on Omega Strikers, including DLC, trailers, updates, and more, as it’s released. Omega Strikers is available now on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam."

The last days of Winter grew closer and the sun began shining a little brighter with every passing moment. Everything was seemingly perfect for the average fan of Daft Punk, that was until the duo made a rare appearance on social media to announce that after 28 years of groundbreaking production and mesmerizing melodies, they are calling it quits. The announcement of their split was paired with a clip from the closing scenes of their 2006 film “Electrorama”, which saw the pair in full Daft Punk garb shaking hands and walking off, only for one member to reveal a bomb and promptly explode. That explosion became more than a cinematic trick as every blog and Daft Punk fan page blew up with fond memories and grief for one of the most successful music groups in recent memory.  Attempting to sum up Daft Punk’s impact on music in one article is a fool’s errand, so let’s focus on a moment in their career that changed the Daft Punk history books as we knew it. 2013 was far from the group’s “break out” year but it did see a massive resurgence in popularity for the duo, and not because an old classic was resurfaced for the sake of social media. 10 years ago (5/17/13), Daft Punk released what would be their final album together. Random Access Memories birthed the tremendously popular single “Get Lucky”, which featured Pharell Williams crooning over funky live instrumentation which included the now iconic guitar melodies strummed out by the great Nile Rodgers. While the album now marks the last official release for Daft Punk, its impact on Daft Punk’s career was obvious long before their break up 8 years later.  Random Access Memories is the duo’s first studio album since 2005’s Human After All which saw the band deconstruct their signature production style and rebuild it into an industrial wall of sound. Coming off what could now be considered Daft Punk’s most aggressive LP and giving fans plenty of time in between releases, Daft Punk was able to completely wipe the slate clean. They’ve already pushed the boundaries of electronic pop and their final album would aim to conquer an area of music that Daft Punk never had the opportunity to take part in. The album has the duo shifting their focus to a more disco-friendly sonic direction and began incorporating live instrumentation into their recording process, leaving only a few programmed drum machines and vintage vocoder melodies as traces of their past sound. This allowed Daft Punk’s music to sound larger than ever, with songs like the explosive intro “Give Life Back To Music” and the Paul Williams-assisted “Touch” bringing a sleek shine to the LP. Random Access Memories is driven by deep grooves, infectious rhythms, and pure love for dance music, and the extensive list of A-list collaborators is only the icing on the cake.  You know there is something special about an album when it takes this long into talking about it to mention that there is a stirringly beautiful Julian Casablancas ballad on the tracklist. For the first time in their careers, Daft Punk opened their studio doors to outside collaborators to help work on a studio album of theirs and they brought in a cast of characters only Daft Punk can assemble. Along with the aforementioned Casablancas and Paul Williams, the likes of Panda Bear, Todd Edwards, Pharrell Williams, and Nile Rodgers are credited as guests on Random Access Memories. What makes these appearances so special is how Daft Punk deployed them, the duo brought these features into their world to uplift their compositions, only bringing in guests when necessary. They could’ve gotten anyone to sing on “The Game of Love” but they seemed to be just as happy with their robotically smooth vocals taking the spotlight. The Panda Bear-assisted “Doin’ It Right” is a minimal, repetitive dance track that has Bear harmonizing with those same vocals from “The Game of Love”, not the usual Panda Bear ascetic but a role he filled beyond expectations. Daft Punk’s use of features on Random Access Memories speaks to not only their overall creativity but may have hinted that their break up nearly a decade later was clear from the release of the album, using Random Access Memories to knock off some bucket list collaborations in a sensational fashion.  Random Access Memories now has somewhat of a bittersweet taste to it 10 years later. While it now acts as Daft Punk’s swan song, it also stands as a testament to two musicians who approached their art with tireless creativity and delivered unforgettable moments of pure fun and musicianship. In 2013 it seemed like Daft Punk had nothing else to prove, they had hits and had won over the hearts of snobby critics and hard-headed music fans alike with their refreshing take on electronic pop music. They approached their fourth studio album as if they had already decided it was their last and left nothing to be desired. The 13 songs that comprise the LP take you through the colorful cosmos of Daft Punk as the duo waves goodbye in an explosion of vivid arrangements, undeniable chemistry, and, most important of all, unforgettable electronic music."

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak greeted Zelenskyy with a handshake and hug after the president's helicopter landed at Chequers, the British leader's official country retreat. It was Zelenskyy's second trip to the U.K. since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, and the fifth European country he's visited in three days.  He is seeking more military aid as Ukraine prepares a long-anticipated spring offensive to retake Russian-occupied territory. The Ukrainian leader also visited Italy, the Vatican, Germany and France.  Russia reacted to the U.K.'s new pledge ""extremely negatively,"" but also doubts that the missiles and drones would drastically change the course of the war, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday.  ""Britain aspires to be at the forefront among countries that continue to pump weapons into Ukraine,"" Peskov said. ""We repeat once again: It cannot yield any drastic and fundamental influence on the way the special military operation (in Ukraine) is unfolding. But definitely it leads to further destruction. ... It makes this whole story for Ukraine much more complicated.""  Zelenskyy said one of the missions of his European travels that started Saturday was to build a ""fighter jet coalition"" to provide Ukraine with vital military power in the air. He said more work was needed on that front.  While the U.K. will not provide the planes, the prime minister said the country would join the coalition and begin a previously announced training program for Ukrainian fighter pilots as soon as this summer.  The U.K., one of Ukraine's major military allies, has provided short-range missiles, Challenger tanks and trained 15,000 Ukrainian troops on British soil. Last week, the government announced it had sent Ukraine Storm Shadow cruise missiles, which have a range of more than 150 miles. The British missiles were the first known shipment of longer-range weaponry that Kyiv has long sought from its allies.  Sunak's office said it was giving Ukraine hundreds more air defense missiles, as well as ""long-range attack drones"" with a reach of more than 120 miles.  ""This is a crucial moment in Ukraine's resistance to a terrible war of aggression they did not choose or provoke,"" Sunak said. ""They need the sustained support of the international community to defend against the barrage of unrelenting and indiscriminate attacks that have been their daily reality for over a year.  ""We must not let them down,"" the prime minister added.  Sunak plans to push allies at a meeting of the Group of Seven leaders in Japan later this week to deliver more support to Ukraine, his representative said.  As Zelenskyy visited European capitals, Russia increased its attacks across Ukraine with drones and missiles. Russia shelled two communities Sunday in the northern border province of Sumy, regional officials said on Telegram. They said 109 explosions were recorded.  Zelenskyy's office said Monday that Russian attacks had killed nine civilians and injured 19 in the past day. Six of the deaths were in southern Ukraine's Kherson province. Two civilians were killed in Chuhuiv in Kharkiv province, and one in Prymorsk, on the Azov Sea coast about 12 miles from Russian-occupied Berdyansk.  The presidential office also reported that Marhanets, which lies across the river from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, was shelled.  Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti reported that an acting regional interior minister appointed by Moscow, Igor Kornet, was injured in an explosion at a barbershop in the Russian-occupied city of Luhansk. The leader of the Luhansk People's Republic, a separatist-held region of Ukraine that Moscow illegally annexed, was quoted as saying a bomb caused the explosion.  Assassination attempts and sabotage attacks have increased in Russian-occupied territory as well as Russia proper. Russian authorities often blame Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv rarely acknowledges such attacks.  Zelenskyy traveled to Britain from Paris, where he met Sunday with French President Emmanuel Macron and secured a pledge of light tanks, armored vehicles and air defense systems.      About 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers will receive training in France this year and nearly 4,000 others in Poland, Macron's office said.  Speaking Monday on the French television network TF1, Macron said training on French fighter jets such as the Mirage 2000 ""can start now"" but rejected the idea of France delivering warplanes to Ukraine.  Zelenskyy also met with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Sunday. It was his first visit to Berlin since the start of the invasion and came a day after the German government announced military aid for Ukraine worth more than $3 billion.  Modern Western hardware is considered crucial if Ukraine is to succeed in its planned counteroffensive. During his European trip, Zelenskyy said Ukraine would aim to liberate Russian-occupied areas within Ukraine's internationally recognized borders and would not attack Russian territory.  Among areas Russia still occupies are the Crimean Peninsula and parts of eastern Ukraine with mainly Russian-speaking populations."

LDO tried to break an important resistance area but failed.  With strong bullish signals again this Tuesday, expect a rally that could extend all the way up to $3.37.  Lido DAO (LDO) price has set the performance bar rather high for itself this summer. With bulls chasing price action higher on Monday, a rejection occurred as bulls ventured to attack $2.20, where both a pivotal level and the 55-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) are being used by bears as defensive structures. Once that area is reclaimed by bulls this week, expect to see a rally that could go well into the summer and hit $3.37 with a 60% profit in the books.  Lido DAO price to be the trade of the season out of the bunch  Lido DAO price is already heading for a very solid performance with a 10% gain already on record for this week. From the looks of it, bulls are back with a vengeance and have already erased all incurred losses for May. If bulls play this right, this could be the best recovery trade of the year, and LDO is set to outperform some peers in the process.  LDO first needs to pare the selling pressure from bears at $2.20, where they have built a fortress around that historically pivotal level and the 55-day SMA that resides nearby. With the bullish performance setting the tone for this week, expect to see that level being torn down later on Tuesday and bulls heading for $2.60. The rally should continue into July with a few catalysts along the way that could lift LDO higher and head toward $3.37.  LDO/USD 4H-chart  A threat to the downside could come with another rejection at $2.20 and one of the tail risks in the US inflating again, such as the on-again-off-again banking turmoil or the debt ceiling negotiations. Expect then to see a leg lower with $2 doubtful to hold. Rather look for $1.85 and the 200-day SMA in between $2 and $1.85 as a circuit breaker to slow down any violent drops depending on the severity of the tail risk or catalyst."

In a jaw-dropping +70,000% moon-shot, millionaires were made in hours in the latest race to profit.  Now in an aggressive cascading retracement, it is clear early backers are securing their profit.  DEXTools / SHROOMS USD  Indeed, despite pittance liquidity of $179k, $SHROOMS trading volume has surged to a whopping $5.56m in the past 24 hours.  This brings $SHROOMS market cap to a lowly $1.43m indicating there could still be room for growth if $SHROOMS is able to consolidate at a high support level - but not much else is known about the coin.  With an emerging tribe of 1,790 holders and over 2000 transactions in the opening 24 hours $SHROOMS seems to be the most recent meme coin to gain traction.  How to Get in Early on Meme Coin Moonshots?  With millionaires made in the opening minutes of meme coin launches, as brave DEX explorers discover hidden gems poised to explode to the upside - many are asking how can you get in early on meme coin moon-shots?  After all, by the time you've seen a +70,000% gain - it is likely far too late to make major profits and this leaves you exposed to potential downside dumps.  Some of the obvious steps you can take to ensure you're investing in only the highest quality meme coins (and avoid getting rug-pulled!) are:  Check the meme coin's smart contract using a Honeypot Detector (ensuring you can sell to lock-in new found gains). Check the funding of deployer's wallets (examine the prelaunch transactions of deployment wallet, ideally finding a 'clean' wallet, in which the only transactions are the purchase of ETH and the creation of the smart contract address). Check if the contract address is verified (this can be done on Etherscan). Check if meme coin liquidity has been locked (it is important to ensure LPs are locked to ensure you can complete later sale of coins). Check if the meme coin project has an active Website, Twitter account, Telegram and Medium (the greater the social media presence, the less chance of a rug pull). Double-check whether the token has both buys and sells (using tools that monitor DEX transactions to avoid honey pots). Check the token holders (if huge swathes of supply are held by few wallets, this could lead to seismic dumping action). Check the buy and sell fees (if transaction fees to deployer are higher than 10% avoid).  By following these steps you can begin to develop a well-researched understanding of what makes a meme coin legitimate, however, to undertake these checks will require a depth of crypto expertise and a familiarity with complex DEX tools.

Despite the extremely wet winter the whole region experienced, Wilbourn said fire crews are still expecting to see active fires this summer.""We've got the taller grass. It's obviously been growing for a while, but then you see underneath, there's a lower-level grass. We call that a double growth. So obviously, there's been different parts of the season where we experienced rain and then we've had a lull to allow the grass to grow, then it goes back to rain, and now we're seeing hot weather again, so these are just different levels of growth that really creates a dense fuel load,"" Wilbourn said. ""The overall landscape and topography of our area in the flat region. It's going to be hot. Fuels are going to dry out very quickly and we're going to continue to have fires.""Wilbourn said that includes fires that begin at homeless encampments, which he said have been increasing in Sacramento County.""Year over year, we've seen an 111% increase in unhoused-related fires, so that means people that are out in the fields, maybe they're cooking for themselves. They have an open flame. The fire gets away and runs and potentially causes a larger fire,"" Wilbourn said.Firefighters from the Sacramento Fire Department and the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District responded to a homeless encampment fire Tuesday afternoon. A spokesperson with the Sacramento Fire Department told KCRA 3 that trees started to catch fire just after 4 p.m. on 14th Avenue near Power Inn Road in Sacramento. Fire crews arrived within minutes and quickly put out the flames.Cellphone video sent to KCRA 3 shows the moments the flames jumped into the higher branches of the trees. Amalia Valencia, who works nearby, said the fire started when she was finishing up some paperwork at the office.""I heard a loud bang — a loud explosion,"" Valencia said. ""It's very scary. I mean, our shop is just right across.""Valencia said she figured the fire had started at the homeless encampment, which she said has caused issues in the area before. Debris and trash can be seen all across that section of land. Valencia said she is grateful the fire did not spread too far, but she added that she is concerned about the summer months.""I had walked through here before and I saw that there were several gas tanks and a barbecue grill on this section area, and I had told my brother, 'Oh, that’s eventually going to end up happening,'"" Valencia said.Sacramento fire officials said firefighters are currently going through wildfire refresher training so that everyone can be prepared to battle fires this summer. Experts are also reminding people who live in areas near dry brush to create some defensible space around their homes."

I ran to my mom, asking her if we could go there in the summer, and she kept nodding her head until it was convincing enough for me to go back to sleep. Ten years later, the New York City lights keep me awake all night long. I remain in a waking dream.  On my plane to NYC, I kept wondering why the Stanford in New York program would choose that our dorms be located in Brooklyn as opposed to Manhattan, the heart of the city. In my head, that only meant missing out on events, a longer commute and wasted hours. I was wrong.  Brooklyn Heights feels exactly like my hometown, Saida, while being nothing like it. It is close to the city but also far from it. Brooklyn Heights, just like Saida, is the best of both worlds.  The Stanford in New York apartments are next to the Brooklyn Heights promenade, which offers among the most iconic views in the city. You can see the Brooklyn Bridge, the Empire State building, the Chrysler building and even the Statue of Liberty while standing there. You can peek into the chaos and the rush of the cars while basking in the sun, watching it go down and making sure you take the right pictures so that you will not have to come back tomorrow, which you already know you will.  On Sunday, I sat there on a bench next to a married couple, with my favorite Montague Street Bagels, and I noticed how most people were silent, even though their footsteps were audible.  On Monday, as I took a lunch break from my work at the NYC Commission on Human Rights, I couldn’t even call my mom because I was distracted by the conversations around me, curious to know more, but also because I couldn’t hear a word she said.  Beirut has changed a lot after the August 2020 explosion, but it remains a lively city that blooms during the summers when foreigners and immigrants come back to celebrate togetherness and visit their old memories. Being in Beirut means hearing music from every corner, having to cover your ears when cars start honking at a minor inconvenience and listening to conversations of girls your age planning their weekend getaways because they wanted to “party the pain away.”  I’d spend my days in Beirut, hopping from one friend’s apartment to the next, eating take-out food and complaining about the skyrocketing prices. Sometimes, I was too enraptured in that chaos, thinking about relocating with no real plan or strategy. However, all I needed was a single voice message from my mom, telling me what my grandmother cooked today and how I should come back so we could watch “Olympus has fallen” for the tenth time together; telling me to come back to Saida.  Saida has also changed a lot after the Beirut explosion. People hide their trauma behind their smiles in the most noticeable way possible. What characterizes Saida is the people inhabiting it. Living there, you have to negotiate for thirty minutes before accepting a gift, try out every food on the table or explain to the host that it wouldn’t be personal if you fail and end every day with a coffee run with your favorite people, bumping into at least five of your least favorite people. Saida is more intimate. You spend your whole life dreaming of getting out and once you do, you start counting down the days till you’re back. While I enjoy traveling to new places, I’ve never met people like the ones in Saida.  Saida is the perfect balance to Beirut, but Beirut is not the same without Saida. The same way that Brooklyn Heights is the perfect balance to Manhattan, but Manhattan is not the same without Brooklyn Heights."

Last season the Green Raiders made it back to the District 1 tournament, but were bounced quickly in the opening round. The last time Ridley hosted a playoff game before Tuesday was in 2017. And the last time the team won in the postseason, home or away, came in 2015, when Bosak and Ridley’s current senior class were elementary school students.  The Hofstra recruit wanted to put on a show against No. 19 Pennsbury and lead the 14th-seeded Green Raiders to victory in the postseason. He didn’t disappoint.  Bosak scored five goals, all in the first half, and dominated the face-off circle in Ridley’s 20-7 trouncing of the visiting Falcons. Ridley (11-8) will travel to No. 3 Pennridge Thursday.  “It’s been seven years since we had a home playoff game,” Bosak said. “I told the guys that this means too much for us to go down. This is the last time playing here at (Phil Marion Field) for the seniors, so we came out fired up.”  Pennsbury had no answer for Bosak, who won 21 of 25 face offs and set the tempo for the Green Raiders offense. After Michael DeZutel gave Pennsbury a 1-0 lead less than two minutes into regulation, Bosak answered to put Ridley on the board.  Bosak found the back of the net three times in a span of two minutes, 36 seconds at the end of the first half. His explosion in the waning minutes before halftime put the Green Raiders in firm control. He pulled off some sweet moves, too, juking and twisting his way to his third goal.  Kolby Ranniello tallied to cut Pennsbury’s deficit to 7-5 with 1:23 left in the second period, but all that did was anger Bosak, who won the ensuing faceoff and darted to the net to score his fourth goal. His fifth and final goal with 55 seconds to go extended Ridley’s advantage to 9-5.  “We came out in sync,” Bosak said. “I haven’t seen us have a game like this all year with this type of energy. Especially from the crowd, too.”  While Bosak was thrilled to see his teammates rise to the occasion, he didn’t mince words about his individual performance.  “I was on today,” he said. “My wingers helped me as well, but I think I was on today.”  The Green Raiders put the game out of reach when they scored five of the final six goals of the third period. They outscored the Falcons11-2 after halftime.  Luke Showalter had a huge day with four goals and two assists. Defensive middie Bobby Soper and Nate McLaughlin, the backup faceoff man, got in on the fun with a goal each. Cole Wills chipped with two. Colin Wintrode excelled in net, stopping nine shots.  “Most of the year, we were in a lot of hard battles and our backups didn’t really get to play all that much,” Bosak said. “But tonight, we gave them a chance. Everyone got involved and that was great to see.”"

Koa Purugganan was recognized last week during the agency’s annual honorary awards celebration, which was held at Reagan National Airport in Arlington, Virginia.  Koa can be seen working regularly at LAS with 6-year-old German Shorthaired Pointer Bimbo-Boom, affectionately nicknamed “Bubba.” Koa has been a canine handler since 2019.  TSA has more than 400 canine handlers across the country who work alongside explosive detection dogs who are trained to work in busy transportation environments. Together, the handlers and dogs are a visible and effective added layer of security within the nation’s transportation system.  “We are thrilled that Koa has been recognized for the outstanding job he along with his four-legged partner Bubba do for the airport community. Koa’s commitment and leadership have made our canine operation at LAS second to none,” said TSA Federal Security Director for Nevada Karen Burke. “Koa is a team player who proactively seeks ways to improve the effectiveness of the canine program while also taking time to mentor other canine handlers to help them improve in the job they do. He and Bubba are exceptional members of our team and are deserving of this award.""  Koa has distinguished himself as a lead trainer for the local canine teams, developing multiple scenarios to test the proficiency  of the dogs and handlers in a variety of situations and locations. He has also implemented daily schedules that maximize the use of canines in screening operations and reduced “down time” for canine teams during daily work assignments.  TSA canines and handlers are most often seen at airports working in the security checkpoint, assisting with the efficiency and effectiveness of TSA’s screening operations. They are also trained to work in mass transit, commuter rail, maritime passenger ferry environments and in other busy venues supporting security operations for marquis events.  These canines are able to conduct a real-time threat assessment of travelers going through the security checkpoint. If a dog alerts its handler to the presence of explosive odor, TSA follows an established procedure to resolve the alarm.  Koa joined TSA in 2014 as a TSA officer (TSO), was later promoted to Lead TSO before being named Supervisory TSO at Kona International Airport on the Island of Hawaii. Koa transitioned to the role of canine handler and began working at LAS. Together, Koa and Bubba supported security operations at the 2022 NFL Draft in Las Vegas and have participated in Reno 911 Training. Bubba is an energetic dog who loves to come to work. When he is at home with Koa, he enjoys running around in the backyard. His favorite reward toy is anything that squeaks.  This is the not the first time the canine program at LAS has been recognized nationally. In August 2021, TSA announced that Alona, then a four-year-old Golden Retriever and explosives detection canine was the winner of the TSA “Cutest Canine” contest. Alona and her handler Vanessa continue to work at LAS.  TSA at LAS is consistently one of the busiest airports in the country, screening more than 23 million departing passengers in 2022."

Amazon Prime members can now add pickleball coverage to their list of membership benefits.  Amazon's Prime Video streaming platform announced Tuesday it's signed a multiyear deal with the Professional Pickleball Association for global streaming rights to four live PPA Tour events per year, including the 2023-2024 PPA Tour World Championship Series.  Amazon Prime's coverage will kick off with a four-day tournament starting Thursday from the Atlanta Open in Peachtree Corners, Georgia.  ""When something has an explosion in growth, naturally it catches our eye,"" Charlie Neiman, head of sports partnerships at Amazon Prime Video, told CNBC.  Amazon said its coverage will include games with top-ranked players such as Ben Johns, Anna Leigh Walters and Anna Bright.  Connor Pardoe, CEO and cofounder of the Pro Pickleball Association, called the deal ""monumental"" for the burgeoning league.  ""It's important for the evolution of the pro game, the game as a whole, and a nice step forward for the professional players,"" he added.  Prime's deal with the PPA also deepens its commitment to the world of sports streaming rights, which range from Thursday Night Football to emerging sports leagues and sports documentaries.  Neiman says Amazon has had tremendous success investing in other emerging properties such as MMA's One Championship or Overtime Elite Basketball. He thinks pickleball has significant growth potential as well, he said.  ""We're always looking at content and making sure our offerings on Prime Video reflect our customers' interests,"" he said.  For pickleball enthusiasts, seeing their sport on the small screen, along with the ability to stream games, is welcome news. But patchwork and evolving media strategy has also made it confusing where to watch.  The PPA Tour's 20-plus tournaments in 2023 can be seen across a variety of platforms that also includes ABC, Fox, CBS, YouTube, the Tennis Channel and FanDuel. Earlier this month, the PPA Tour announced that ESPN will cover eight of the league's tournaments.  ""Where pickleball is today, it's a sport that's really hot,"" said Pardoe. ""It's really exciting and nobody wants to miss out on it. But also, no one's really ready to commit to the whole thing as well.""  Pardoe said it will take time to get a more concise and consistent media deal, but today the league is focused on getting its brand ""anywhere and everywhere.""  Pickleball continues to see rapid growth, with an estimated 36 million people picking up a paddle between August 2021 and August 2022, according to a report by the Association of Pickleball Professionals. The sport grew more than 158% over the past three years, according to the 2023 Sports Fitness Industry Association Topline Participation Report."

The video itself takes viewers on a visually stunning journey as the band plays the song out. Showcasing a dynamic and vibrant colour palette, the clip perfectly complements the raw intensity of the track.  My Hero The Homewrecker opens with a neo-classical violin intro that sets the scene, leading the way for crushing guitars and pounding drums to compliment the song’s distinctive feel.  Walter Webb has the falsetto and effortless cool of Muse’s Matt Bellamy and a bass-playing style akin to the English band’s bassist Chris Wolstenholme. The rest of the band – violinist Isaac Vincent, Angelo Webb (drums, samples) and guitarist Kalen Austin fire on all cylinders, bringing the ambitious, towering track to life.  Never miss a story! Subscribe to our newsletter Sign Up  Green and purple lights flash on the set as confetti falls during the song’s chorus. Mecha Mecha's music blurs the lines of dark indie rock and neo-classical metal, with tinges of psytrance and EDM.

My Hero The Homewrecker follows previously released tracks from the band including Greedy Boys and Caught In A Cage. For the former, Mecha Mecha told The Music, “The song is highlighting the extended childhood the members of this band feel we have been given. Both in the support from our family and friends to pursue our music dreams, but also sort of culturally we’ve been allowed to chase a teenage dream.”  You can catch Mecha Mecha performing My Hero The Homewrecker at Moondoll Festival at Mansfield Tavern, Brisbane, on Saturday, 3 June.

Recently, astronomers utilised this telescope's cutting-edge technology to observe a distant star-forming galaxy, delving into its intricate structure with unprecedented detail.  Discovery of the Galaxy  Harnessing the capabilities of NASA's billion-dollar observatory, the James Webb Space Telescope's Orbiter Spacecraft has unveiled the stellar composition of GN20, one of the earliest-known galaxies in the universe. Situated a staggering 12 billion light years away, this captivating discovery represents a luminous and dust-laden star-forming galaxy of extraordinary brilliance.  Significance of the Galaxy  What makes GN20 particularly intriguing is its relatively recent formation, occurring a mere 1.5 billion years after the cataclysmic event known as the Big Bang. Positioned within a region of space referred to as a protocluster or galaxy overdensity, this area holds astronomers' fascination due to its eventual culmination in the formation of colossal galactic clusters.  Insights into the Galaxy's Structure  The captivating image captured by the James Webb Space Telescope allows us to peer back in time when the universe was a mere 1.5 billion years old, as it stands at approximately 13.5 million years presently. Astonishingly, this ancient galaxy boasts a star formation rate approximately 1,860 times greater than the mass of our Sun each year. Astronomers, under the guidance of Luis Colina from the Spanish Astrobiology Centre, employed the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) to examine GN20's structural properties during November 23-24, 2022.  Findings of the Study  Analysis of the MIRI images unveiled a clumpy molecular gas surrounding the galaxy, forming a colossal disk spanning about 46,000 light-years in diameter. Furthermore, the measurements indicated that the galaxy comprises a diffuse gas envelope encompassing a densely packed nucleus of shimmering stars. Remarkably, the nucleus spans a mere 2,600 light-years across, while the gaseous envelope extends approximately 23,000 light-years.  About the James Webb Space Telescope  James Webb Space Telescope stands as NASA's most prominent and powerful space science observatory. Boasting a large infrared telescope with a primary mirror of around 6.5 metres, this state-of-the-art instrument represents a monumental leap forward in our quest to understand the cosmos. It has been positioned a million miles out into space. It orbits the Sun and not the Earth."

OKX is the fifth-ranked exchange, according to CoinMarketCap data with a 24-hour trading volume of $825 million, receiving 2.2 million weekly visitors.  $LHINU will list on the top decentralized exchange (DEX) Uniswap at 2 pm UTC, four hours after the OKX listing.  The top centralized exchange announcement means that Love Hate Inu is launching with maximum impact.  Checkout the OKX $LHINU listing announcement tweet.  Love Hate Inu raised $10,204,000 million in its presale, making it one of the largest crypto fundraises of the year.  Given the meme coin frenzy of the past few weeks, Love Hate Inu could not have picked a better time to launch. While many of those meme coins are already dying, Love Hate Inu has a real business model that guarantees it is here to stay.  How and when to claim $LHINU tokens  Token holders from the presale will be able to claim their coins at 9 am UTC Friday 19th, one hour before the OKX listing takes place.  To claim tokens purchased in the presale, holders simply need to connect on the Love Hate Inu website with the wallet originally used to buy the $LHINU tokens, and then click the ‘claim’ button.  The tokens will appear in the token holder’s wallet.  You can still buy $LHINU before the OKX listing – don’t miss the next Shiba Inu  For those who missed out on Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, or Pepe, this is an exceptional opportunity to capture what could be a staggering return on investment.  Love Hate Inu’s unrivaled utility sets it apart, which explains why it has become one of the hottest meme coins of the year. Crypto analysts predict 10x returns for $LHINU.  Today’s crypto investors don’t just want to chase cute Inu coins with no utility. The best crypto projects, like Love Hate Inu, are taking the utility-led approach.  The team believes that by building a great product, it will attract the users.  As such, Love Hate Inu is creating a system that is scalable so that it can onboard potentially millions of users who will want to vote in its polls.  Love Hate Inu packed with viral utility – the only vote-to-earn meme coin  In sharp contrast to many other meme coins, Love Hate Inu is packed with utility. Its primary use case is to enable community members to hold polls on any manner of subject matter.  Voting is secured by staking the $LHINU token, making the polls immune to manipulation. Voting mechanisms are an ideal use case for blockchain technology.  In addition to providing security, the blockchain’s decentralized network architecture enables voters to be rewarded for their participation through the earning of $LHINU tokens.  Users of the platform can vote on anything in the world they think worthy of a poll, from celebrities and personalities they love or loathe to whatever it is that is of trending interest on the web and beyond.  As can be seen by the examples on the project’s website, meme illustrations have been created of personalities such as Donald Trump, Elon Musk and Andrew Tate, that have viral meme qualities.  The imagery is eminently shareable, helping to achieve viral popularity.  The demo polls that the team has been running support that thesis, with huge interest being shown in the numbers taking part. Tens of thousands have taken part.  Love Hate Inu has hit on a winning formula. Precisely because the internet thrives on controversy and polarization, it means there will always be strong demand on both sides of a divide, as voters vie to get the polling outcome that puts them on the winning side.  Source / $LHINU  Love Hate Inu to transform the survey and polling industry  It is not just individual internet users that the project is targeting. Companies and nonprofits will also want to make use of the voting platform to drive brand engagement and to help organizations to reach their goals.  Again, because of the security of the platform and its ability to verify participants as real people because of the staking mechanism, the team believes the Love Hate Inu service will be particularly attractive to companies who want to conduct surveys.  The platform will also be much more accessible and efficient for companies to use than legacy systems. And Love Hate Inu is working on building a VIP onramp for companies, to encourage adoption.  CEO Carl Dawkin: “We are inserting ourselves into the internet’s big conversations”  Love Hate Inu CEO Carl Dawkins, an adviser to the UK All Party Parliamentary Group on Crypto and Digital Assets , is excited to be able to announce $LHINU’s top exchange listing.  “Everyone here at Love Hate Inu wants to extend a big thank you to everyone in our community that has helped to put our token on the map in such a big way,” said Dawkins.  “It is no accident that OKX is listing $LHINU so early in the Love Hate Inu journey, because they clearly recognize a project with potential to generate growing trading volumes.  “But ultimately Love Hate Inu is about launching a product that has the ability to appeal to a mass market audience. We are creatively inserting ourselves into the big conversations that take place across the internet every day.

Hasan is charged with second-degree murder in the death of his ex-girlfriend Melinda Vasilije.  While Hasan has admitted to stabbing Vasilije to death in the spring of 2017, he says she attacked him first, and he blacked out.  Throughout his first four days on the stand, Hasan spoke quietly, with the judge often asking him to speak up.  On Tuesday, Hasan raised his voice and said through tears he did not mean to kill Vasilije - showing intense emotion for the first time since the trial began.  “I should be in jail for a very long time, but I swear to god, I lost control. Convict me for life. I don’t care… but, I blacked out. Don’t try to say I did this in the right mind,” Hasan said, in part.  “I killed her, yes. I didn’t do this out of anger. I didn’t do this because we didn’t get back together. It happened because I was a [..] idiot. It’s all just hitting me.”  Hasan has admitted to stabbing Vasilije 47 times in the early hours of April 28, 2017.  According to Hasan’s previous testimony, after breaking up on April 3, the pair reconciled on the 27.  Security camera footage showed them at Hasan’s vehicle less than an hour before her death.  The footage shows Vasilije going back to her apartment while Hasan walks to his car door.  He then turns around and follows Vasilije back inside.  According to Hasan, once back in her apartment, he admitted to cheating on her during their relationship.  Hasan says at this point she attacked him with a knife. He says he remembers grabbing a knife and stabbing her twice before blacking out.  On cross-examination, Crown attorney Brendan Thomas directed a barrage of questions at Hasan.  “You treated her bad? You cheated on her? You gave her an STI and didn’t tell her? You tried to make her think she was responsible for it? You refused to get treatment? You never told her because you didn’t want to lose the relationship?” Thomas asked.  Hasan answered “yes” to each question.  He was then asked by Thomas: “You were desperate to get her back, you were obsessed, you lied and tried to manipulate her, you said anything to meet with her in person, and you finally got what you wanted?”  He was also asked: “Your one moment of honesty came just before you killed Melinda?”  Court then saw the text Hasan sent Vasilije an hour after her death.  It reads: “Nice seeing you tonight glad we worked things out!! You better have deleted that [..] lol. Anyways see you soon.”  According to Hasan, he sent the message because he thought it might make the police think it wasn't him invovled.  The crown then showed an email sent by Hasan to a Waterloo regional police officer nearly two months after the stabbing  In it, Hasan writes in part: “I’m considering turning myself in, before I do I need you to do something for me. I need you to answer a few questions for me, I know you don’t have to but I will be willing to turn myself in, but I need the answers to these questions first.  He then goes on to say: My first question is, did Melinda ever sleep with anyone else in the course of our relationship (cheat) or not? After we broke up in (sic) April 3 did Melinda ever go on a date between then and April 28? Also did she ever sleep with anyone during the course of that time (sic).”  “If I get the answers I will turn myself in, hopefully before her birthday on June 28.""  The Crown has portrayed Hasan as extremely insecure and obsessed with the idea that Vasilije was cheating on him.  They say this email shows he was still dwelling on it 51 days after he killed her."

Luis “Louie” Ruelas threatened to “f–king bury” people in the explosive trailer for Bravo’s “Teresa Gets Married” special. Bravo  The trailer sees Teresa Giudice breaking down in tears amid her drama with brother Joe Gorga and his wife, Melissa Gorga. Bravo  After breaking down in tears, a woeful Giudice, 50, seems to be talking about her estranged brother when she says, “I just don’t want his name brought up.”  Meanwhile, the “Turning the Tables” author’s eldest daughter, Gia Giudice, suggests that her entire family’s relationship with the Gorgas is all but finished.  “It’s over for everybody — including me and my sisters,” Gia, 22, says in a confessional.  The Gorgas skipped the Aug. 6, 2022, nuptials. Charles Sykes/Bravo  The drama between Teresa and the Gorgas hit its apex in the summer of 2022 after the “Real Housewives of New Jersey” OG brought up rumors that Melissa, 44, cheated on Joe, 47, with longtime friend Nick Barrotta.  A source previously told Page Six the Gorgas — who have been married since 2004 and share three children — “laughed off” the claims.  For more Page Six reality TV updates  Melissa — who, with Joe, subsequently decided to skip Teresa and Ruelas’ Aug. 6, 2022 wedding — later said on her “On Display” podcast, “Sometimes when things are too toxic and you try over and over and over again and it just keeps coming back around to the same thing, even if it’s family, you have to let it go.”  Giudice’s drama with the Gorgas hit its apex in the summer of 2022 as production for “The Real Housewives of New Jersey” Season 13 was winding down. melissagorga/Instagram  Teresa’s longtime frenemy Margaret Josephs, who is close with the Gorgas, attended the wedding, but seemingly felt uncomfortable attending — as she notes in the preview.  “All I can think of is we’re all here and Melissa and Joe are not,” she tells co-stars Jackie Goldschneider and Jennifer Fessler.  Despite the volatile turn of events, there are lighthearted moments expected to play out in “Teresa Gets Married.”  Giudice’s four daughters served as bridesmaids. Charles Sykes/Bravo  Giudice’s co-stars Dolores Catania and Jennifer Aydin were also part of the bridal party. Charles Sykes/Bravo  Several of Teresa’s “Real Housewives” friends — including “Dubai” star Chanel Ayan, “Potomac” star Ashley Darby, “New York City” star Dorinda Medley and “Atlanta” star Kenya Moore — make cameos.  “I love a Jersey wedding,” Medley, 58, says at one point.  Teresa’s infamous wedding hair is also highlighted, though her pal and bridesmaid Jennifer Aydin seems uncertain about the elaborate $10,000 style.  “Hair’s supposed to be an accent piece, not the main event,” Aydin, 46, quips in a confessional.  “Teresa Gets Married” premieres Tuesday, May 23, at 8 p.m. ET on Bravo."

The victim called police the next morning. Deputies observed video footage from the night before and saw the suspect cut open the toolbox in the truck bed, Cutting said.  Police are still investigating the incident.  ‘Explosion’ at high school  Sonoma police responded to a reported “explosion” at Sonoma Valley High School on Wednesday, May 10, likely stemming from a pyrotechnic device, Sonoma Police Chief Brandon Cutting said.  As deputies were responding to the incident, a fire alarm went off on another side of campus, but police are unsure if the two incidents were related, Cutting said. No evidence of an explosion was found on site, and no student could be identified.  No damage was reported and the incident is being handled by school officials, Cutting said.  Petty theft  As a Sonoma woman entered Whole Foods on May 10 around 4 p.m., she was confronted by a group of three strangers who worked together to steal her purse, Cutting said.  One of the suspects approached the woman and asked her for directions to Sonoma Valley Hospital while the other two took her purse, which contained credit cards and about $100 in cash, Cutting said. The cards were charged $500 shortly after at a nearby ATM.  Sonoma police believe the group is a part of a known theft ring in the Bay Area which previously stole items from Halem & Co. jewelry store, Cutting said. There are no leads at this point.  Hit and run  On May 13, Sonoma police responded to a reported hit and run on the 19000 block of Robinson Road.  Video footage near the incident showed a driver hit a parked Honda and continue driving. Deputies found the suspect’s unoccupied car near Verano Avenue and Main Street the next day, but were unable to find the driver, Cutting said.  Sonoma police are still searching for the suspect.  DUI  Police responded to a reported hit and run at 7:22 a.m. in the area of First Street West and Spain Street in downtown Sonoma on May 13.  A witness followed the suspect’s Nissan Xterra and called police, who quickly located the driver and conducted a traffic stop, Cutting said.  Deputies determined the 37-year-old Sonoma man was under the influence of alcohol. Deputies conducted a Breathalyzer test that showed the suspect had a BAC of 0.27 — more than three times the legal limit, Cutting said.  The suspect was arrested for misdemeanor DUI and hit and run, Cutting said.  Contact Chase Hunter at chase.hunter@sonomanews.com and follow @Chase_HunterB on Twitter."

St. John Bosco defensive back Jason Mitchell. Mitchell has several schools on his list and plans to take at least five if not more official trips this cycle. It sounds like many of those trips will come after he makes his decision.  We had a chance to catch up with Mitchell last week at the Braves College Showcase and he updated us on where his recruitment is at right now.  “I’m still set to commit Sept. 16 at the Kahuku (Hawaii) game,” Mitchell said. “I plan to take a few official trips in June and then the rest will be during the season.  “I think I’ll be able to take a few in-season before the Kahuku game and then I’ll do a few after that. You only go through this once and I really want to enjoy the recruiting process so I want to try and take as many trips as I can.”  The schools Mitchell mentioned who he’s hoping to visit include LSU, Notre Dame, Oregon, USC, Utah and Washington. He talked about what stands out with each program:  LSU: “LSU likes me as a corner and that’s where I enjoy playing. I’ll play anywhere but I like corner and LSU is one of those schools like Oregon and USC that I would call a childhood favorite. I always liked them growing up, they produce great defensive backs every year and get them drafted. I like their style of play, the SEC is a great conference so I’m excited to visit there on a game weekend.”  Notre Dame: “Notre Dame is on me really heavy and they’re recruiting me as an athlete right now. They feel I can play corner or safety and haven’t specified exactly where they like me, they said they just me and they’ll find a spot once I get there. I know a lot will depend on my frame and how big I get but I see a lot of opportunity at Notre Dame. They have a great staff in place with a great head coach who knows defense really well. I like how they’re recruiting me, and so, I’m excited for my visit and we still need to decide if that will in June or during the season.”  Oregon: “Oregon feels a lot like L.A .(Los Angeles) to me. I don’t mean the city as much as the people there. They have a lot of coaches that are from here and when I talk to them, it feels like home for sure. I love the vibe and the way I feel when I’m with those guys. They’re good coaches and quality people and I’ve always loved the Oregon program a lot.”  USC: “I mean, it’s USC. What else can I say? It’s the school I grew up watching, my dad played there, so I’ve always followed them. It’s a childhood favorite, but still, I have to pick the best school for me, not just who I liked when I was young. It’s a business decision, but saying that, I do like USC a lot and I’m really close with (defensive backs coach and defensive passing game coordinator) Donte (Williams) and the rest of the staff.”  Utah: “I’m going to visit Utah for sure during the season and the coaches gave me their schedule and I just have to pick a game. I love that staff and they show a lot of love. I talk with (special teams coordinator and cornerbacks) coach (Sharrieff) Shah, (defensive coordinator and safeties) coach (Morgan) Scalley, (head) coach (Kyle) Whit(tingham), and everyone there is so real and genuine. There’s nothing but great people at Utah and they’re all about development, so I really like them a lot.”  Get the latest football and basketball transfer portal news from 247Sports.

Omaha Gross 5, Beatrice 2  Beatrice got on the board first on an RBI single by pitcher Deagan Nelson, but the Cougars capitalized on a couple of errors to take a 3-1 lead in the second inning. Colby Duncan reached first base on an error that scored Carson Almgren as Duncan collided with the Orangemen first baseman.  Owen Brennan then drove a fly ball to deep right, as Joshua Buhr made a good adjustment in right for the out, but Alex Kosse scored easily from third, and on an error on the throw to home, Duncan also scored.  An RBI single by Colby Duncan provided an insurance run in the top of the sixth.  ""We got some big at-bats,"" Gross head coach Jim Hempel said, after the Cougars followed a 13-run performance with five on Tuesday.  ""One through nine here for these last few games, we've had guys really locked in and they've been having good ABs. We talked about if we don't strike out, we put the ball in play, and hit a few hard, we're gonna win a lot of games because our defense is good and our pitching has been really good this year.""  Starting pitcher Joseph Rempe was pulled after 5.1 innings of one-run ball for Jack Miller with two runners on and one out in the bottom of the inning.  ""We told Joe we had to have him go deep into this game,"" Hempel said. ""He hadn't thrown this whole week, and he went out and gave us everything he had, just gutted it out. (He) gave up that early run and then just settled in which, that's been his career. He's beaten a lot of big teams over the last two years.""  Using a ""very manageable"" curveball, Rempe commanded the zone and put the Cougars in a position for Miller to come in and finish the win.  After getting a strikeout, Miller induced the final out to keep the Cougars lead at 4-1.  An Almgren sacrifice fly added some room to the Gross lead, but the drama didn’t end there in the seventh.  On a play at the plate, Rempe trucked into the Beatrice catcher Noah Jobman after running through third on a single to left, and was tossed from the game, igniting some shouts from both benches but without escalating further.  Rempe will miss the first game but not the second (if necessary) against Elkhorn North tomorrow.  ""Curious to see some video of that. So I wasn't real happy about that. I understand the out call but the ejection I thought was a little questionable with the catcher coming up the line in a split second. You don't have any options. You're gonna have contact in a play like that. So it's unfortunate that we will lose him for the first game.""  Miller shut the door in the bottom of the inning for a second straight Cougars win to earn his school record-tying fourth save of the season.  ""We didn't want anybody else out there other than Joe and then Jack Miller does what Jack does. He tied coach Peters' spring record for saves, and that was his fourth one today, and he's been wanting to get on the big board up at school, so that would be able to get him on. So he's pretty excited about that.""  Omaha Gross next plays Elkhorn North on Wednesday at 10 a.m. back at Fricke Field. A loss to the Wolves would end the season, while a win would set up a win-or-go-home for both teams, the winner advancing to the Class B state championship game on Friday at Tal Anderson Field at 4 p.m.  Om.

Draper was then driven in on a sac fly by Nathan Thomas, and another from Keegan Stobbe scored the Trojans ninth run of the game.

Here are my two favourites at the moment.  2 growth stocks that might explode in the near future  You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources , and more. Learn More .  Over the last 20 years, growth stocks have handed shareholders some of the best returns that the stock market has to offer.  Take Amazon, for example. A £10,000 stake in 2003 would have surged 10,079% to become over a million at today’s share price.  While that’s hardly typical, it does show what’s possible. And there are two stocks I own that I think have the potential to shoot up in the coming years.  Games Workshop  The first stock I’m excited about is tabletop gaming company Games Workshop (LSE: GW). Its share price has already grown over 20 times from £4.23 to £98.30 inside the last decade.  This growth shows what a good job it’s been doing building its brand. In fact, from 2016 to 2022:  Revenue increased from £118m to £414m  Margins increased from 11% to 31%  Net income increased from £13m to £128m  The total market cap grew to £3.2bn from only £161m  A Henry Cavill TV series  As impressive as all that is, I think it might just be the start here. As what’s really exciting is the potential of its Warhammer intellectual property.  Other fictional worlds like Star Wars, Marvel or Lord of the Rings have had outrageously successful – and lucrative – TV shows and movies.  And only last year, Amazon struck a deal with the firm to create a Warhammer series starring Henry Cavill. If that goes on to have success like those other big franchises, then I’d expect my Games Workshop shares to move much higher.  It’s worth mentioning that the show hasn’t even been filmed yet, so any success is not at all guaranteed.  Tesla  My second choice, electric vehicles (EV) manufacturer Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), needs little introduction.  The carmaker has already grown at a 40% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the last 10 years. That’s thanks to its success in producing desirable EVs, taking a 65% share of that market.  But its success does present an obvious question: is the growth phase already over?  Musk’s latest vision  Personally, I don’t think so. And the reason is its owner Elon Musk has a much grander vision. He wants Tesla to put self-driving vehicles on roads all around the world.  The company that introduces safe and effective autonomous vehicles will surely see huge growth. It’s like creating the same productivity as millions of taxis and lorry drivers in one fell swoop.  And Tesla looks well placed here. First off, the firm’s vertical integration – making its own batteries, having its own repairs, and the like – means the company trounces its competitors when it comes to margins.  Tesla Toyota Honda GM Ford Stellantis 2022 Net Margin 15.5% 6.9% 4.80% 6.20% -1.4% 9.2%  That’s a lot more cash to spend on research and testing its autonomous vehicles.  But also, Musk’s latest move was to slash thousands off the prices of his cars. By doing this, he thinks Tesla can gain further market share to give itself an untouchable advantage in self-driving technology.

Take Amazon, for example. A £10,000 stake in 2003 would have surged 10,079% to become over a million at today’s share price.  While that’s hardly typical, it does show what’s possible. And there are two stocks I own that I think have the potential to shoot up in the coming years.  Games Workshop  The first stock I’m excited about is tabletop gaming company Games Workshop (LSE: GW). Its share price has already grown over 20 times from £4.23 to £98.30 inside the last decade.  This growth shows what a good job it’s been doing building its brand. In fact, from 2016 to 2022:  Revenue increased from £118m to £414m  Margins increased from 11% to 31%  Net income increased from £13m to £128m  The total market cap grew to £3.2bn from only £161m  A Henry Cavill TV series  As impressive as all that is, I think it might just be the start here. As what’s really exciting is the potential of its Warhammer intellectual property.  Other fictional worlds like Star Wars, Marvel or Lord of the Rings have had outrageously successful – and lucrative – TV shows and movies.  And only last year, Amazon struck a deal with the firm to create a Warhammer series starring Henry Cavill. If that goes on to have success like those other big franchises, then I’d expect my Games Workshop shares to move much higher.  It’s worth mentioning that the show hasn’t even been filmed yet, so any success is not at all guaranteed.  Tesla  My second choice, electric vehicles (EV) manufacturer Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), needs little introduction.  The carmaker has already grown at a 40% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the last 10 years. That’s thanks to its success in producing desirable EVs, taking a 65% share of that market.  But its success does present an obvious question: is the growth phase already over?  Musk’s latest vision  Personally, I don’t think so. And the reason is its owner Elon Musk has a much grander vision. He wants Tesla to put self-driving vehicles on roads all around the world.  Story continues  The company that introduces safe and effective autonomous vehicles will surely see huge growth. It’s like creating the same productivity as millions of taxis and lorry drivers in one fell swoop.  And Tesla looks well placed here. First off, the firm’s vertical integration – making its own batteries, having its own repairs, and the like – means the company trounces its competitors when it comes to margins.  Tesla Toyota Honda GM Ford Stellantis 2022 Net Margin 15.5% 6.9% 4.80% 6.20% -1.4% 9.2%  That’s a lot more cash to spend on research and testing its autonomous vehicles.  But also, Musk’s latest move was to slash thousands off the prices of his cars. By doing this, he thinks Tesla can gain further market share to give itself an untouchable advantage in self-driving technology.  For me, the biggest risk here is simply that other investors agree with me. Today’s share price of $172 bumps the price-to-earnings ratio up to an expensive-sounding 50.  But even at that price, I think Tesla can join Games Workshop on my list of stocks that I’m extremely bullish about for their future growth potential.

While the pair returned to screens this week to host This Morning, reports have been circulating that Holly is looking to pull the plug on their TV partnership. On Monday, the stars managed to present the show with a smile, but many viewers spotted tension under the surface. But what are Holly and Phil actually rowing about and when did it begin? READ MORE: Holly and Phil's ‘awkward’ snap highlights backstage 'tension'  Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield returned to This Morning  After first working together back in 2006, Holly and Phillip have been best friends ever since. But despite appearing on the ITV daytime show together, reports surfaced the pair were ""barely speaking"" off camera. According to The Sun, following the ""Queue-gate"" scandal last year, Holly made it clear to ITV bosses that she would continue to host the show even if Phil leaves. It comes after the This Morning hosts faced backlash after thousands of mourners had to wait for up to 24 hours to pay their last respects to Her Majesty amid claims the presenters had skipped the queue.  Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield are close pals  Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield present Dancing On Ice  In a special pre-recorded message at the time, Holly and Phil said they ""would never skip the queue"" and were given special broadcast access. Reports later suggested their friendship had ""cooled off"" in recent months. Last week a source told The Sun that while they are ""putting on smiles"" for the show, there are ""naturally some tensions"". “This has been brewing quietly for some time"", the source told the publication: ""But now it’s all out in the open and people are talking about it. There is no getting past it.""  Holly Willoughby joined This Morning in 2006  Following these reports, Phillip released a statement to the same publication where he referred to Holly as his ""best friend"". It read: “As I have said before, Holly is my rock. We’re the best of friends — as always, she is an incredible support on screen, behind the scenes and on the phone. ""Holly has always been there for me, through thick and thin. And I’ve been there for her. The last few weeks haven’t been easy for either of us.” After Phillip released a statement regarding his friendship with Holly, calling her his ""rock"", sources claimed the mother-of-three was ""blindsided"" by the message which she knew nothing about.

Story Highlights Bitcoin price is heavily consolidating within a very narrow range, allowing the other cryptos to intensify their pace and rise high.  Besides, some of the altcoins like Polkadot appear to be preparing for a massive explosion that may raise the levels beyond a 2-digit figure.  The crypto space is maintaining a choppy trend as the prices of the major tokens have been hovering within a very narrow range. Besides, one of the popular altcoins is displaying acute strength as it has been accumulating for the past few weeks. The Polkadot price is currently testing one of the crucial supports and is believed to rebound and reach a 2-digit figure soon.  The Polkadot price, similar to the other tokens within the markets, has maintained a healthy upswing since the beginning of the year. After the remarkable drop, the price is now heading towards the critical levels that may offer a required bounce to rebound and rise above the bearish influence.  DOT price currently appears to be in a group of leaders who are primed to break out from the prolonged downward trend. After a 2-month rise, the Polkadot price surged by nearly 100% and quickly dropped into a deep consolidation for the 3rd month. Therefore, the DOT price cannot continue to fall until it holds the critical levels at $4.83.  Moreover, if Elliot wave analysis is done on the current trade setup, then wave 2 is very close to completion. Therefore, the next wave could be an upward wave that may lift the price towards the upper targets at around $10 to $10.5 initially. However, an extended bullish trend may lift the price close to $12.30."

They described the rush to leave Sudan, which involved destroying documents and lowering the flag.  Top editors give you the stories you want — delivered right to your inbox each weekday.

Christopher Wolfert watched plumes of smoke rising in the distance amid the booms of exploding mortars and cracks of machine-gun fire in Sudan's capital.  It was Saturday, April 22. The US Marine Security Guard was protecting the American embassy in Khartoum, which had been engulfed by deadly violence for a week at that point. As the situation deteriorated, the Pentagon dispatched Special Operations Forces to evacuate US diplomatic staff in a dramatic helicopter operation. A little under 100 people were rescued from the US embassy compound in just under an hour on the ground.  As Navy SEALs and Army Special Forces rushed in, Sudan's capital was spiraling toward civil war. Tensions between rival powers had finally boiled over, and street fights raged.  ""It was audible and visual,"" Wolfert later said, referring to the fighting nearby. ""The evacuation itself — fairly surreal.""  Wolfert is one of a dozen Marines whose detachment was assigned to guard the US embassy in Africa's third-largest country and one of three Marines that Insider spoke to, along with an official from the Diplomatic Security Service, an agency under the State Department, about the April 22 drawdown and evacuation of America's diplomatic outpost in Sudan.  The men Insider spoke with described scenes of chaos outside the embassy walls and a rush inside to quickly close up shop and get out of Sudan, from destroying sensitive national security information to lowering the American flag. It wasn't what anyone had wanted to see happen.  ""Unfortunately, we really didn't have a choice,"" Staff Sgt. Derek Ferrari, the detachment commander, told Insider. ""When it was time to leave, it was time to leave.""  Smoke is seen in Khartoum, Sudan, Wednesday, April 19, 2023. AP Photo/Marwan Ali, File  Fighting in Sudan first broke out on April 15 when clashes erupted between forces loyal to Gen. Abdel Fattah al Burhan, commander of the Sudanese army, and Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, who leads the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The two have been competing for power ever since they orchestrated a 2021 military coup together.  Within days, violence quickly gripped the country, killing hundreds of people and injuring thousands more. Foreign governments began efforts to pull out their diplomatic staff and, in some cases, also moved to evacuate their civilians.  At one point, armed fighters even opened fire on a clearly marked US embassy convoy that had identification plates and an American flag. No one was hurt, but Secretary of State Antony Blinken slammed the incident as ""reckless"" and ""irresponsible."" By April 20, US forces had been deployed to positions near Sudan in case they had to quickly extract diplomatic staff.  Though there were signs, the Marines didn't know for sure an evacuation was coming, but it's something that they were ready for. It is something they prepare and train for. ""It's not likely to happen,"" Ferrari said. ""But you need to be ready if it does.""  A symbolic moment  Marine Security Guards are a 24-hour presence at US embassies around the world, and their mission is to protect classified information, US government personnel, and the physical facility. At any given diplomatic post, the Marines work under regional security officers (RSOs) from the Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) — the ambassador's security and law enforcement advisors.  The Marine Security Guard Detachment assigned to the US Embassy in Khartoum, Sudan, stand for a photo in front of McMaugh Hall at Marine Corps Embassy Security Group Headquarters, Quantico, Va., on April 24. US Marine Corps courtesy photo  ""We could not do what we do overseas without Marine Security Guards,"" DSS Deputy Assistant Director Thad Osterhout told Insider. Marine Sgt. Nicholas Bonasera said ""they take care of us as we take care of them.""  Security officers train to handle a wide range of scenarios, such as intruders at the embassy, medical issues, and bomb threats, as well as emergency embassy evacuations and shutdowns.  ""There are some things that are out of your control,"" Ferrari said, but this is why they train. When the Marines learned the embassy had to be evacuated, they sprang into action to start shutting it down.  A flag-lowering ceremony takes place at the US embassy in Khartoum before it is evacuated. Gen. David H. Berger via Twitter  One order of business was lowering the American flag. All the Marines who weren't occupied with other security-related jobs at the moment took part in a ceremony that involved lowering the flag and presenting it to the ambassador, John Godfrey.  ""The American flag represents our footprint in that country and everything that the American people are bringing to that country through our diplomatic channels,"" Ferrari said. ""There's symbolism in lowering the flag.""  A flag-lowering ceremony at the US embassy in Khartoum. Gen. David H. Berger via Twitter  Getting people as violence gripped the capital  Before the evacuation could take place, all the diplomatic staff had to be consolidated at the embassy, which is one large compound protected by a wall. But US government personnel were scattered several miles away across Khartoum in a separate main housing compound and several auxiliary compounds.  Osterhout said DSS special agents had to slip outside the embassy and rescue people as fighting raged throughout the city. Sometimes, they had to wait until a safe window opened up so they could move people back to the embassy. In other cases, agents had to make multiple attempts to retrieve people who were staying temporarily at hotels.  People walk by a house hit in recent fighting in Khartoum, Sudan, Tuesday, April 25, 2023. AP Photo/Marwan Ali  Consolidating everyone in one location ""was critically important for our Department of Defense partners,"" Osterhout said. ""Had the DOD evacuation force had to go to more than one location in a city under the conditions Khartoum was in, [it] would've both complicated their planning and execution, but it also would've entailed significantly more risk.""  Outside the embassy walls, there was a lot of confusion on the ground, with poor command and control from the top down on behalf of both warring parties. Osterhout said that while the US was ""confident"" the embassy would not be specifically targeted by senior leadership on either side, there was no assurance that local fighters would avoid this.  DSS Deputy Assistant Director Thad Osterhout (far right) and other DSS leadership, alongside interagency partners, closely monitored the departure from Khartoum from the DSS Command Center in Arlington, VA on April 22, 2023 US Department of State photo  Moving about Khartoum meant traveling in a contested environment, one in which an American could easily end up in the wrong place at the wrong time. At least two Americans have been killed since the fighting began.  Osterhout said there were ""significant concerns"" that low-level forces may seize an opportunity to hold up an embassy convoy or try to gain access to a housing compound, rather than the embassy itself. Osterhout said the embassy is a ""very hard target"" because the Marines guarding the facility are a ""very effective deterrent.""  During the evacuation preparations, the Marines had to protect the national security information at the embassy, which meant safeguarding and destroying sensitive equipment and classified information. Doing this meant balancing available manpower because the Marines had to continue guarding the building like they would normally on a round-the-clock basis and also staff various security posts.  Though fighting was happening in the immediate vicinity of the embassy, neither the Sudanese army nor the RSF were intentionally trying to attack the embassy, Ferrari said. Still, there was a lot of indirect fire and ordnance being thrown around in the surrounding areas.  ""You could see and smell and hear everything around you that could at any time ... have been a great threat to the embassy, whether it was intentional or unintentional,"" he added.  Evacuating the embassy  Fighting like this can always threaten air operations, but when President Joe Biden gave the orders to evacuate the embassy in Khartoum, it signaled that Washington was willing to take that risk.  At 9 a.m. EST on April 22, three MH-47 Chinook rotary aircraft took off from Djibouti and stopped to refuel in neighboring Ethiopia before flying another three hours to Khartoum. As is standard practice for diplomatic outposts, the embassy had a pre-designated landing zone in an open field around 500 feet outside the southern entrance to the compound.  Even as the evacuation unfolded, the Marines were constantly busy conducting their standard operating procedures, as they had been since the moment the conflict broke out. They manned the security posts until the very last hour, at which point they had to be shut down.  DSS Deputy Assistant Director Thad Osterhout (far left) and other DSS leadership, alongside interagency partners, closely monitored the departure from Khartoum from the DSS Command Center in Arlington, VA on April 22, 2023. US Department of State photo  Physically moving dozens of personnel from the embassy to the helicopters fell entirely on the responsibility of the more than 100 US troops — all Special Operations Forces — who had flown into Khartoum that day. Once the Marines and diplomatic staff were loaded up onto the helicopters, the mission was complete.  ""The evacuation was conducted in one movement via rotary wing,"" Lt. Gen. D.A. Sims, director of operations for the Joint Staff, told reporters later that day. ""The operation was fast and clean, with service members spending less than an hour on the ground in Khartoum.""  The Marines said that departing Sudan was a ""bittersweet"" moment. There was a sense of sadness to leave behind their Sudanese colleagues and the friends they had made in the country, yet there was also a feeling of satisfaction in knowing that they did their duties.  ""Even though it's seems like we're leaving our diplomatic footprint behind in Sudan, we were leaving with all the personnel that we were supposed to,"" Ferrari noted. ""No one had been killed, no one had been seriously injured, everybody had been evacuated safely. So that is a successful mission as a whole — that is something that no one should be sad or upset about.""  ""Our job is to protect the embassy,"" Wolfert said. ""We had done our jobs well.""  US Mission personnel assigned to the US Embassy in Khartoum, Sudan, embrace each other upon their safe return to the United States at Dulles International Airport, Va., on April 24. US Marine Corps courtesy photo  With the embassy staff gone, questions remained over whether Washington would move to evacuate US citizens, as some other Western nations had been doing. At one point, the State Department and the Pentagon organized a land convoy — with drone support overhead — to bring Americans to a part city along the Red Sea, where they could then travel onward to Saudi Arabia. Naval support had also been moved into the region.  Meanwhile, fighting in Sudan shows no signs of slowing down, and civilians continue to pay the ultimate price. According to United Nations estimates, over 600 people have been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have either become internally displaced or fled the country.  Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organization, warned last week that the violence is crippling the country at an economic and social level.  ""As well as facing shelling and insecurity, people are dealing with dwindling supplies of water, food, medicines, and electricity,"" he said. ""Establishing safe routes for humanitarian aid is critical. But the ultimate solution is peace."""

After years of explosive growth during the pandemic, Home Depot’s revenue during the first quarter fell short of expectations and the company cut its profit and sales outlook for the year, sending shares skidding before the opening bell Tuesday.  It was a rough start to a busy week of retail earnings and the numbers from the nation’s biggest home improvement chain dragged down retails stocks as well as the Dow.  Advertisement  For the three months ended April 30, revenue dropped to $37.26 billion from last year’s $38.91 billion, and it was short of the $38.45 billion projected by analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research.  Sales at stores open at least a year, a key indicator of a retailer’s health, dropped 4.5%, and it dropped 4.6% for stores in the U.S.  Advertisement  “After a three-year period of unprecedented growth for our sector, during which we grew sales by over $47 billion, we expected that fiscal 2023 would be a year of moderation for the home improvement market,” said CEO Ted Decker.  Decker said weak sales were mostly due to lumber deflation and bad weather, particularly in its Western division which had to contend with extreme weather in California.  But the Atlanta company cut its expectations for the year with as shift in spending becomes more clear with the economy slowing and costs rising for builders and homeowners.  The U.S. Federal Reserve has hiked benchmark interest rates 10 consecutive times with hopes of slowing the economy and cooling inflation.  The U.S. economy slowed sharply from January through March, decelerating to just a 1.1% annual pace as higher interest rates hammered the housing market and businesses reduced their inventories. An estimate from the Commerce Department last month showed that the nation’s gross domestic product — the broadest gauge of economic output — weakened after growing 3.2% from July through September and 2.6% from October through December.  Home Depot cautioned in February that it expected profits to slip this year. The chain saw remarkable growth over the past three years, as many people hunkered down at home or were searching for a new home during the pandemic. Americans spent heavily on home renovations and other projects.  With the easing of the pandemic, Americans began to spend on things that had faded in recent years, like dinners out and vacations.  Home Depot earned $3.87 billion, or $3.82 per share, in the quarter. A year earlier it earned $4.23 billion, or $4.09 per share. That was better than the per-share earnings of $3.80 that industry analysts were expecting.  Advertisement  Home Depot Inc. now expects sales and same-store sales to decline between 2% and 5% this year. Several months ago, the company said it expected sales to be flat compared with 2022.  The chain now expects full-year earnings to fall between 7% and 13%, expanding the potential decline from earlier expectations that the retreat would remain solidly in the single-digit percentage range.  Shares dropped more than 3% before the market open on Tuesday."

For context, it was at that time that bands like ESG and Liquid Liquid existed at the forefront of the Disco Punk frontier, mixing No Wave, Disco and Post-Punk sounds to craft an entirely new genre for music. DJ Kool Herc, meanwhile, was building the foundation for breakdancing, and Blondie had just put out Parallel Lines.  In the art scene, Keith Haring had just set up shop in the Lower East Side, while Jean-Michel Basquiat and Al Diaz were tagging Manhattan under their SAMO alter-ego. “It was a mythical time for art and music in the city,” as the brand puts it.  Referencing the era through clothes, YMC is celebrating ’70s New York’s breakthroughs with clashing colors, military surplus references and arty prints. Cotton ripstop, leaf print camouflages and field jackets in soft twill nod to the army-inspired silhouettes of the time, while shirting appears inspired by Basquiat’s legendary works. The color palette, which largely consists of washed blue, black, ecru, red, brown and royal blue, is just as much a sign of the times.  The brand’s signature pieces, like the Bowie shirt, arrive with fresh New York-inspired patterns. The PJ Overshirt is made from a delicate Broaderie Anglais; the Walker Jacket enlists a pre-washed dye, and the Battle Jacket dons a military-inspired brown facade. Clashing colors, as mentioned, appear in stripes on the Bluebird Dress and Rat Pack Cardigan, referencing the “anarchic spirit” that defined the period.  YMC’s Pre-Fall 2023 collection is now available to shop on the brand’s webstore. Revel in the range in the gallery above.

Explosion of a missile is seen in the sky over the city during a Russian missile strike in Kyiv, Ukraine May 16, 2023.  Kyiv was targeted by 18 different missiles in a “pretty intense” attack overnight, according to Ukraine – but officials managed to shoot them all down.  According to the country’s authorities, at least three people were injured in the assault from both drones and missiles.  It came just as Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy concluded his European tour where he was asking Western allies for greater military support against Russia – and received substantial pledges for more funding and equipment.  The first air raid alert went off at 2.30am local time (11.30pm GMT) and only ceased two hours later.  This was the eighth time the capital has been targeted by missiles this month alone, following a 50-day pause on the attacks.  Moscow has increased its attacks against Ukraine in recent weeks while bracing itself for Kyiv’s counteroffensive.  But, this series of missiles was particularly devastating, because Kyiv was attacked from the north, south and east with 18 air, sea and land-based missiles.  Miraculously though, no fatalities have been reported yet.  Still, as the British ambassador to Ukraine, Dame Melinda Simmons, tweeted: “A full on aerial attack on Kyiv last night, pretty intense.  “Bangs and shaking walls are not an easy night. Hope everyone is OK.”  A full on aerial attack on Kyiv last night, pretty intense. Bangs and shaking walls are not an easy night. Hope everyone is ok. — Dame Melinda Simmons (@MelSimmonsFCDO) May 16, 2023  The head of the Ukrainian capital’s military administration, Serhiy Popko, also said the attack was “the maximum number of attack missiles in the shortest period of time”.  But, he said “preliminary information” shows most of these were “destroyed”, leaving rocket debris across the city.  Story continues  Six of the missiles were allegedly Kinzhal hypersonic missiles – those which exceed the speed of sound by five times – which Moscow previously claimed could not be defeated by any air defence system.  Officials think Moscow wants to exhaust Ukraine’s air defence systems through its barrage of attacks.

The city’s mayor, Ahmed Aboutaleb, has blamed drugs gangs for the escalating violence, claiming that the success of authorities in intercepting narcotics shipments has triggered a wave of between against rival groups and their families.  The national police force is setting up a specialist team to gather information about the attacks. “We will analyse all incidents: what kind of area are they taking place in, what explosives or weapons are used?

Police have arrested a number of suspects in recent weeks, including two teenage boys who were caught in the act of placing a firebomb.  “Parents, neighbours and relatives need to talk more to the council and the police, because there are plenty of people who know that youths are hanging out on the streets at night,” she said. “Look at each other and ask: ‘why weren’t you home last night?'”"

At the time, gold was enjoying a parabolic rally, and the discussion amongst the general public was how far past the $2,000 mark gold was going to strike during that rally.  So, on Aug. 11, 2011, I concluded my first gold article on Seeking Alpha as follows:  ""Again, since we are most probably in the final stages of this parabolic fifth wave ""blow-off-top,"" I would seriously consider anything approaching the $1,915 level to be a potential target for a top at this time.""  Needless to say, my first market prognostication was not met with tremendous support. These are a sample of the comments I received from Seeking Alpha readers when I was calling for a metals market top:  ""With all due respect Avi, you plainly do NOT understand the gold market."" ""Your TA is useless. You don't understand the fundamentals because you only look to the past. Gold bulls are forward thinking. The times they are a changing..."" ""The problem is that TA is like driving a car by only looking in the rear view mirror... There is no foresight involved; it's all based on past performance. The future of the fundamentals is what you fail to grasp."" ""There is no way you can understand what is going on in gold by doing technical analysis. Gold is driven by fundamentals."" ""Technical analyses is all well and good, but you cannot apply it to the PM sector which has been artificially manipulated and suppressed for years.""  Yet, as we now know, gold struck a top within $6 of the top for which I was calling.  What many may have seen as either ignorance or hubris, I even provided my downside target even before gold topped, wherein I explained my expectation for gold to drop back down to the $1,000 region.  ""Based upon the Elliott Wave Principle, I would expect a very large pullback. In fact, the target for such a pullback will probably be a minimum low of $1,400, it could fall as low as $1,000, or even as low as $700. It will depend upon how the decline takes form. But those are very viable targets for gold on the downside.""  And, the comments regarding my views were basically the same as above, so, I will just note one of the more ""reasonable"" comments:  ""There is no way to rationalize $700 gold with 50% debasement of currency expected over the next 5 years as US debt grows to $21 trillion from $14. It makes no sense to my feeble mind. I vote for $3000 vs. $1900 today. That makes sense to my mind.""  As you can see, it was quite clear at the time that the ""fundamentals"" were keeping most metals bulls looking to the long side. And, amazingly, those same fundamentals kept the metals bulls looking to the long side of the market during the entire decline.  ElliottWaveTrader.net  But what was truly amazing was that as gold was approaching its long-term low struck at the end of 2015, almost the entire market turned bearish and was again ""certain"" that it would continue in its downside trajectory (just as strongly as they were certain we would eclipse $2,000 in 2011), with most now turning from bullish to predicting a drop below $1,000.  Well, just like everyone was uber-bullish at the highs when we expected a major top, we turned bullish when everyone turned uber-bearish. On Dec. 30, 2015, I urged investors to be moving back into the metals complex as we were looking for a long-term bottom to be struck imminently due to the significant bearishness evident in the market:  ""As we move into 2016, I believe there is a greater than 80% probability that we finally see a long-term bottom formed in the metals and miners and the long term bull market resumes. Those who followed our advice in 2011, and moved out of this market for the correction we expected, are now moving back into this market as we approach the long term bottom. In 2011, before gold even topped, we set our ideal target for this correction in the $700-$1,000 region in gold. We are now reaching our ideal target region, and the pattern we have developed over the last four years is just about complete... For those interested in my advice, I would highly suggest you start moving back into this market with your long term money...""  In fact, back in September 2015, and when the metals mining companies were absolutely hated by the investor community, I rolled out a service on ElliottWaveTrader specifically to focus on the mining industry. We began urging our clients to buy mining stocks during the last quarter of 2015. In fact, I bought stocks such as Newmont Mining (NEM) in the $15-17 region at the time. And, NEM was my largest holding in the complex since that time.  Now, fast-forward to 2022, and gold had been stuck in a correction since a local top was struck back in August 2020. Yet, there were pockets within the market which still rallied into 2022.  An example of such outperformance in 2022 included NEM, which went on to strike higher highs in April 2022. Yet, when NEM struck the 84-85 region, I outlined to the members of The Market Pinball Wizard that, for the first time since I bought NEM in 2015, I was selling almost my entire holdings in the company. You see, I set a target of 82-89 when NEM was hovering in the 28 region. And, when we moved into my target region, I stuck with my plan and sold my largest holding in the complex. Since that time, NEM dropped 57% off its highs.  So, back in January, I provided my latest assessment of the gold market, with an expectation for gold to rally to the $2,428 region in this current move off the early November low. I also noted that we can certainly even blow through that, depending upon the extensions we see in the upcoming rally, but that target was a solid one for now. Clearly, I will reassess the target once the next bullish phase begins in earnest.  And, then in April, I outlined my expectation for the metals market to begin its next rally to the $2,200-plus region. My expectation was that a break-out through $2,075 would trigger that next bigger move. Yet, while the market spiked to $2,085 in early May, I warned members of The Market Pinball Wizard that the structure of that move did not look like it was starting that rally to $2,200 just yet, and I expected more of a pullback. So, while the market did spike through $2,075, it clearly was not able to sustain that rally, as we expected, and it immediately spiked back down below.  At this time, I'm still expecting a fast and strong rally to $2,200-plus in the coming months. And a break-out over $2,085 will likely now be the trigger.  But silver is providing to us a relatively low risk buying opportunity as it's setting up to see a very strong upside follow through when this pullback completes.  To keep it very simple, we have been outlining to the members our expectation for the pullback we're now seeing in silver, and it's now striking our general target region for this expected pullback. As long as silver holds over $22.50, I'm expecting this pullback to complete over the coming week or two and set us up for a strong rally which should be pointing us north of 27 rather quickly.

Pix:Twitter  International concerns about Nigeria’s high fertility rate calls for a deeper reflection on our national demography and its implications. Clearly, Nigeria’s bourgeoning young population is a potential national asset and the envy of the developed nations.  But without a clear-cut plan for their general well-being, especially quality education and job opportunities, the future is bleak and a reason to rue high fertility.  Globally, population is one of those indices through which nations are measured for their strength or the lack of it. Population strength is as potent as the economic power of a country, its political influence and military might in the comity of nations. And closely tied to population is the average fertility rate that obtains from one country to the other.  Given the significance, a recent global ranking placed Nigeria as the 8th most fertile country in the world, and in an odd category crowded by fellow African countries. Notably, Nigeria and the likes have continued to increase global population at a time the world is slowing down and has recorded a 50 per cent drop in fertility. According to the report published by Daily Mail UK, the global average number of children born to each woman is now 2.3, compared to 4.7 in 1970.  While swathes of Europe and North America are recording less than two births per woman on the average, Africa is leading with Somalia (6.4), Chad (6.4), The Democratic Republic of the Congo (6.2), Mali (6.0), the Central African Republic (6.0), Angola (5.4), Nigeria (5.3), Burundi (5.2) and Benin (5.1). The case of Nigeria already stands out for analysts, given the estimated population (without an actual headcount though) in excess of 206 million people – and the seventh most populous country in the world.  Indeed, the debate on values of a large population is not new. In fact, there are two broad schools of thought regarding population and development. Population might be a demographic dividend or a demographic disaster. That is, it could be a great economic, political and social asset, if well harnessed. Otherwise, it is a liability and time bomb of incalculable destruction waiting to happen.  The Malthusian argument of finite resources already forewarned the negative impact of overpopulation, which includes high-level unemployment, hunger, food crisis, and crime rates – and other social ills that are now self-evident in Nigeria and part of the African continent. Again, an unwieldy and poorly managed population increases the number of out-of-school children, which the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) already pegs at 18.5 million in Nigeria alone.  In addition, is fiery competition for scarce resources and seething social tension, coupled with poor access to healthcare, education and general sense of despondency. Not far-fetched in that setting is overcrowding, depletion of natural resources, and environmental degradation.  Population, vis-à-vis available resources, already places Nigeria in a dire strait. Hence, the need to be wary of unbridled population spikes. Because the socio-political and economic structures prevalent in a society are usually the deciding factor of population policy, concerned stakeholders have consistently said that the very low level of Nigeria’s utilisation of available resources has set the country up for minimal population growth rate – if it must avert disaster.  So, population growth must slow down until Nigeria gets the socioeconomic parameters right. Therefore, at present, the political office holders need to stabilise the political economy, come up and enforce a policy that will keep the population within manageable limits; not discounting civic education to show down the birth rate.  On the flip side of the narrative, however, the population positivists argue that a large demography is not the problem per se, but for the poor management of its potential. They argued that declining fertility rates could lead to a stagnant population, which is crippling many advanced economies and overwhelming public support systems.  Currently, falling fertility rates mean nearly every country could have shrinking populations by the end of the century. No fewer than 23 nations – including Spain and Japan – are expected to see their populations halve by 2100. Researchers at the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation also showed the global fertility rate nearly halved to 2.4 in 2017 – and their study projects it will fall below 1.7 by the turn of this century. The implication is that countries will also age dramatically, with as many people turning 80 as there are being born.  On the contrary, Nigeria’s rapidly growing population is giving life to the baby food market and industries. According to a research firm, the Nigerian baby food market has a promising future and is expected to reach over N200 billion by 2023 on the back of high birth rate and fertility rate. While the multinational companies (MNCs) are already enjoying steady patronage from the Nigerian baby food market, the market remains an untapped opportunity for Nigerians.  "

The mine operator, Massey Energy, was found at fault for the tragedy.. By Danielle Letenyei May 16 2023, Updated 4:23 p.m. ET  Over 21,000 coal miners in West Virginia have lost their lives on the job since the 1880s. One recent fatal mine accident in the state was the Upper Big Branch Mine disaster in 2010, which claimed the lives of 29 coal miners.  Article continues below advertisement  On April 5, 2023, the 13th anniversary of the UBB tragedy, West Virginia lawmakers and residents held a memorial to honor those who died in the mine explosion. They also announced plans to build a Miners Memorial Wall in Beckley, W.Va., in honor of the UBB victims and all other miners who have died on the job in the state.  Source: Getty Images  Article continues below advertisement  What happened at the Upper Big Branch Mine disaster?  The Upper Big Branch Mine disaster is known as the second deadliest coal mine disaster in the U.S. It happened on April 5, 2010, at the Upper Branch Montcoal Eagle Mine, about 30 miles south of the West Virginia state capital of Charleston.  At 3:27 p.m. that afternoon, miners were working 1,000 feet underground when a massive explosion rocked the mine. It was later determined that the blast was caused by a build-up of methane gas and coal dust, the U.S. Department of Labor’s Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) reported.  Article continues below advertisement  Initially, 25 miners were killed, and four were missing after the blast. The four missing were found dead in the mine four days later. 28 of the dead were employees of Massey Energy, the company that owned the mine, and one miner was a contractor, The New York Times reported in 2010.  Source: Getty Images  Article continues below advertisement  Did anyone survive the Upper Big Branch Mine explosion?  Nine miners survived the UBB mine disaster. Survivor Stanely Stewart, who was 300 to 400 feet underground when the explosion happened, told ABC News that he struggled through “hurricane-force” winds and flying debris to get out of the mine.  Survivor James Woods was one of nine miners traveling in an underground vehicle on their way out of the mine at the time of the explosion. The blast killed seven of those in the vehicle, and Woods was pulled out of the mine barely alive, the Associated Press reported. Woods’s son, Jeremy, also worked in the mine and survived the blast.  Article continues below advertisement  Another miner who survived wasn’t as lucky. He lost his son, brother, and nephew in the blast, ABC News reported.  Who was at fault for the Upper Big Branch Mine disaster?  Massey Energy, the company that owned the Upper Big Branch Mine, was found primarily at fault for the explosion.

The MSHA conducted its own investigation into the cause of the UBB explosion and fined Massey $10.8 million, stating that Massey’s corporate culture was “the root cause of the tragedy.” It was the largest fine in the agency’s history.

I am no longer ashamed,” Josie Concepcion said years after the traumatic event of her life.  Josie and her granddaughter in front of her sari-sari store in Lutayan, Sultan Kudarat. Photo: B. Sultan/ICRC  Josie, alongside her son, was one of the victims of a massive explosion near a market in Sultan Kudarat 15 years ago, according to a report released by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).  Luckily, her son was safe with a minor injury. But for her, life went straight downhill.  She went through multiple surgeries to recover her left leg which was badly fractured because of the explosion.  Healthcare professionals noticed that her legs were not of the same length anymore, which explained why she had a hard time walking.  She was given crutches by a volunteer of the Philippine Red Cross she met during that time.  Josie did not just struggle physically but also emotionally and mentally, the ICRC noted. As years passed, she felt like a burden and a useless mother to her family. When she attends Mass or walks outside, people would look at her with derision.  People would mock her saying, “Here comes the cripple.” Josie said it pains her to hear those words.  “I wanted to escape. I wanted to end my suffering. But in a fleeting moment, I thought of my family. ‘What will happen to my children? My husband?’” she was quoted in the ICRC report.  With all those struggles she faced, her husband was her biggest supporter. She felt love and kept going with her life despite all the mockery and gossip she hears.  In 2018, a social worker mentioned that the Davao Jubilee Foundation (DJF) has a program that helps people who were victims of armed conflict.  Josie in front of her newly constructed store. Photo: I. Ali/ICRC  The DJF program strives to make a positive impact on the lives of people affected by armed conflicts. Through this initiative, individuals in need receive specially crafted devices designed to enhance their mobility and independence. The ICRC supports the DJF’s physical rehabilitation services as well as donations for food and transportation for the beneficiaries.  Josie was told that she would no longer have to use crutches if she uses an orthoprosthesis. She was uncertain about that suggestion but she gave it a try and visited the DJF’s office.  After being fitted and learning how to walk with the orthoprosthesis, Josie’s life slowly came back to what it used to be.  The orthoprosthesis, according to the ICRC, serves as an attachment to Josie’s shorter leg, giving her equal footing with the good leg. This secures her balance with both feet planted on the ground, eliminating the need for crutches and ultimately enabling Josie to do the things she loves with ease.  Years after bearing with all the discrimination and mockery of other people, her wish to walk the way she walked before came true. With the help of DJF and ICRC, she is ready to face the world more confidently without thinking about what people might say about her. She is thankful for the support given to her.  Josie now owns a small sari-sari store which she started through ICRC’s micro economic initiatives project—providing productive grants to affected Mindanawons to start or revive their own business.  Now, her only wish is to walk up the stage and proudly hang a medal on her son without the crutches she’s been using for the past years.  “I have nothing to leave to them but their education. I encouraged my son, who is a consistent honor student, to keep up his good work. It is my dream to go up on stage for his graduation. Before, every time he received an award, I refused to go on stage because of my crutches. Now, I want to go on stage without it,” she said. (Zaki Sarmiento / MindaNews)"

Essex Police received a report that a previous occupant, who had been evicted, was allegedly trying to gain access to their old property in Southend on July 22 2021.  The man was known to police on duty, as he had been released from prison that morning after receiving a custodial sentence for assaulting a police officer.  They were aware the individual had been evicted while in prison, and therefore should not be able to access the property.  READ MORE: Three people taken to hospital after crash involving four vehicles on A127  For this reason, PC Sam Hilbery, PC Joe Farrow and two other colleagues all attended.  PC Hilbery and PC Farrow arrived and were informed the suspect might be in a nearby van. As they approached the van, PC Farrow tried to open the back door while PC Hilbery looked through the window.  Suddenly the van exploded, causing PC Hilbery to be thrown back by the blast. She sustained severe burns and had glass embedded in her face and upper torso.  PC Farrow moved PC Hilbery away from further danger and provided initial first aid.  Colleagues started looking for the suspect, with all available units at Southend Police Station making their way to the scene.  He was located within the vehicle and officers got him out to a place of safety, before placing him under arrest.  PC Farrow made surrounding occupants aware of the situation, activating his vehicle siren and lights to draw people's attention, before directing them to a safe place.  Three other officers, including Sgt Katy Major, arrived within minutes and helped him evacuate the whole street.  Sgt Major took control of the scene and ensured roadblocks were put in once the area was cleared.  PC Hilbery was being tended to by PC Steve Martin and PC Garry Neal.  They stripped off her burned clothing and poured water over her to reduce the burns.  Story continues  Sgt Major directed the rest of her team to bang on doors to get more water, for both PC Hilbery and for the suspect, who was also injured and receiving first aid.  Paramedics arrived, took over first aid and conveyed PC Hilbery to the hospital. The paramedics praised the officers on scene, whose quick actions ""undoubtedly"" lessened the severity of PC Hilbery’s burns.  PC Martin said: “We heard officers going to an incident which didn’t seem overly serious… And then the next thing we heard was an emergency call… over the radio, all you could make out was there’d been an explosion and someone was hurt.  “On that particular scene, because I knew that a police officer had been hurt, there’s a lot of confusion, people are quite upset with what’s going on, and then when you’re seeing a colleague being brought towards you, clearly in pain, it’s a bit of a cliché but the training did take over in terms of the medical treatment we gave her.  “It’s good to see that the training we had meant that we could minimise any injuries to Sam and that she remains a police officer doing the job for the people of Essex.”  The suspect went to court but was found not guilty of any offences.  Essex Police Federation Chair Laura Heggie said: “All of the officers who attended this incident showed great professionalism and initiative, in what was a very traumatic and stressful situation. Together they were able to detain the suspect, secure the scene, protect the public, and ensure that PC Hilbery was given the best care possible.  “Seeing a colleague in pain is a distressing experience for everyone, but these officers were able to remain calm and composed. They should all be very proud of their brave and exemplary actions.”  The officers will attend the Essex Police Federation Bravery Awards on Thursday (May 18).  At the event a winner will be announced who will travel to London for the National Police Federation Bravery Awards in July."

Owners will receive notification of the recall beginning June 26, 2023, according to the recall notice. Licensed GM dealers will provide complimentary replacement of the front driver’s side airbag module with a new inflator.  For more information, owners can contact Buick customer service at 1-800-521-7300, Chevrolet customer service at 1-800-222-1020, or GMC customer service at 1-800-462-8782 and reference GM’s recall number N232404980.  ARC Automotive Inflator Recall Requested by NHTSA  Officials have called for ARC Automotive to issue a recall for approximately 67 million air bag inflators, following reports of the air bags exploding, sending sharp metal fragments and debris at the vehicle’s occupants. They provided detailed reports of the airbags rupturing and causing injuries to consumers in the airbag recall request to ARC.  NHTSA officials have been independently investigating the safety of airbags manufactured by ARC Automotive since August of 2016, after receiving multiple reports of consumers sustaining severe injuries to their head, face, and legs, as well as at least one fatality that resulted from a ruptured airbag.  After initiating an investigating into the exploding airbags, the agency concluded that a defect in the manufacturing process of the airbag inflators contributed to a blockage of the inflator. The blockage, which occurred as a byproduct of welding during manufacturing of the inflator, can cause over pressurization, which can then overinflate and rupture the airbag, resulting in an explosion of metal debris into the vehicle’s passenger compartment.  ARC Automotive maintains that a defect is not present in their airbag inflators. Despite the potentially significant and unreasonable safety risks the inflators pose to consumers, ARC has not cooperated with the agency in issuing a safety recall, which has prompted several automobile manufacturers to issue recalls of their own, impacting thousands of vehicles.  To date, General Motors has now issued five separate recalls since 2018, affecting model year 2010 through 2011 Chevrolet Malibu vehicles, model year 2008 through 2017 Buick Enclave, GMC Acadia, and Chevrolet Traverse vehicles equipped with airbag inflators manufactured by ARC.  In addition, BMW issued a recall in 2017 of their model year 2017 X5 sDrive35i, X5 xDrive35i, X5 xDrive50i, X5 xDrive35d, and X5 xDrive40e vehicles, Ford issued a recall in 2017 of their model year Mustang and F-150 pickup vehicles, while Volkswagen also issued a recall in 2022 of various model year 2016 Volkswagen and Audi vehicles.  The NHTSA says it may take other appropriate action against ARC if they continue to decline initiating a voluntary recall. The agency has indicated that if an ARC recall is not issued, the airbag inflator manufacturer must provide a detailed explanation on why they believe the product is safe, along with data supporting their analysis.  Takata Airbag Recall Still Affecting the U.S. Auto Industry  These latest airbag problems comes while the U.S. auto industry continues to replace defective Takata airbags, which were also found to explode and project metal debris onto vehicle occupants due to a defect in the airbags design. At least 28 deaths and more than 400 injuries have resulted from the defective Takata airbag inflators.  More than 100 million Takata airbags have been recalled worldwide since 2014, impacting tens of millions of vehicles from more than 20 automobile manufacturers. Officials identified that the chemical nitrate was used to inflate the air bags, which can break down from exposure to heat or humidity, resulting in the explosion of metal fragments and debris.  The series of Takata airbag recalls has been considered the largest and one of the most complex series of recalls ever recorded in U.S. history. However, if approximately 67 million ARC Automotive airbags are recalled in the coming weeks, the auto industry could be plagued for years bv the need to repair and replace the recalled airbags, in addition to the risk of potential product liability lawsuits."

By Tuesday afternoon firefighters had turned the building at 716 Oregon Ave. back over to the Spokane-based OXARC company, said Ben Shearer, the Pasco Fire Department public information officer.  Firefighters were called shortly before 10:20 a.m. for an explosion in a metal building where acetylene is manufactured. The production building contained only acetylene containers and the machine that makes it.  Acetylene is a flammable gas used in welding and doesn’t produce much smoke when it burns. It’s kept in canisters under pressure, and it can explode when exposed to high heat.  It’s not clear what sparked the fire.  One employee was working in the area when the explosion happened but was able to escape unharmed.  OXARC employees were evaluated by Pasco medics at the scene and one employee was taken to a local medical center to be checked further, said Shearer.  Much of the time battling the blaze was spent planning an approach to extinguish several burning containers of acetylene but not put fire crews at risk.  “The fire was complicated from the aspect that OXARC is a large supplier of many different gas products, some that do not care if they get wet and some react violently if they get wet,” Shearer said in a news release.  They worked with OXARC employees to determine where the acetylene was being stored and making sure the machinery that produced it was shut off.  Firefighters on the scene focused on making sure the heat and fire didn’t spread to other buildings.  “Once we knew what we were dealing with, everything went very quickly and efficiently,” Shearer said.  Shearer didn’t know how extensive the damage was to the building, but the business is shut down at the moment.  OXARC provides welding and industrial supplies and safety products and training from its 21 locations across the Northwest.  While there was some initial concerns about the smoke and acetylene in the air moving through East Pasco, Shearer said the gas had dissipated quickly. He said they are not aware of any public health issues.  Story continues  There also wasn’t any chemical spills. Shearer said firefighters prevented water from going into the storm drains.  An explosion forced people to flee from OXARC Tuesday morning. Firefighters have closed Oregon Avenue to battle the blaze.  Oregon Avenue has opened after being shut between East A Street and East Lewis Street. It also sparked a brief lockdown at some nearby schools as a precaution.  The warm temperatures meant firefighters were being rotated in and out at the scene and then able to rest in a cooling area.  In all, 34 fire units helped at the fire, including crews from Pasco, Richland, Kennewick, Franklin County Fire District 3, Walla Walla Fire District 5, Benton County Fire districts 1 and 4, West Benton Fire Rescue and from the police and utility crews from Pasco and Franklin Emergency Management."

City officials say an initial investigation shows an underground electric cable likely caught fire and caused the chain of explosions.  National Grid workers also told 2 On Your Side they were replacing a cable carrying 25,000 volts.  2 On Your Side is told the cables are around 100 years old and the city has been replacing some of them around town prior to the manhole explosions along Edward Street.

Soon after, a large explosion occurs inside the store, leaving pieces of debris scattered on the floor as the room fills with smoke.  Just as the explosion goes off, the overnight clerk, Mohammed Oumar, is seen running away from it from behind the counter.  ""I looked at the camera and I saw like a bomb inside the machine,"" said Oumar.  He says smoke started hissing from inside the ATM before it rocked the small convenience store. Oumar says he dropped to the ground then went inside the bathroom to get away from the thick smoke.  MORE HEADLINES:  Footage from the scene appeared to show the front part of the machine missing, but the rest remained intact.  At least three male suspects, who police say could be in their teens to early 20s, fled the scene, and are being sought by police.  Over the last few years, Philadelphia Police have responded to several other ATM explosions and thefts.  In January, witnesses say they heard an explosion on North 65th and Media streets in West Philadelphia where police say there was an attempted ATM theft.  That same month, police say the suspects got inside a store on the 7000 block of Woodland Avenue and removed an ATM and stole cash, merchandise, and a handgun.  In this latest attempted theft, Oumar says the safe inside the store was not damaged, and no cash was taken."

(Image credit: UiT/AKMA3)  Ocean explorers in the Arctic have discovered an underwater volcano spewing mud and methane from inside another, larger crater that probably formed after a catastrophic blowout at the end of the last ice age.  Researchers spotted the unusual feature about 80 miles (130 kilometers) south of Norway's Bear Island, or Bjørnøya, in the Barents Sea. The volcano, which the team named the Borealis Mud Volcano, is only the second of its kind discovered in Norwegian waters.  ""Exploring the seabed and discovering new methane [seeps] is like finding hidden treasures,"" said Stefan Buenz (opens in new tab), a professor at The Arctic University of Norway (University of Tromsø) and co-leader of the Advancing Knowledge of Methane in the Arctic (AKMA) expedition that made the discovery. ""Every time we go down to the seabed, we get the feeling that we have just begun to understand the great and incredible diversity of such [seep] systems,"" Buenz said in a translated statement (opens in new tab).  A submarine mud volcano is a geological structure formed by an expulsion of muddy fluid and gas, predominantly methane.  The Borealis Mud Volcano measures roughly 23 feet (7 meters) in diameter and is about 8 feet (2.5 m) tall. On May 7, the scientists used a remote-controlled rover to capture footage of the small mount continuously emitting a muddy fluid, which the researchers say is rich in methane. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas once it reaches the atmosphere and contributes to climate change .  Related: 'Mind boggling' array of 19,000 undersea volcanoes discovered with high-resolution radar satellites  The volcano sits in the middle of another, much larger crater, which is 984 feet (300 m) wide and 82 feet (25 m) deep. The exceptional formation sits 1,312 feet (400 m) below the sea surface and likely resulted from a sudden and massive methane eruption after the last glacial period, 18,000 years ago, according to the statement.  ""Seeing an underwater eruption in real time reminds me how 'alive' our planet is,"" Giuliana Panieri (opens in new tab), a professor in geology at The Arctic University of Norway and the leader of the expedition, said in the statement.  The researchers found the volcano's flanks teeming with animal life feeding off carbonate crusts — mineral crusts formed when microorganisms consume methane and produce bicarbonate as a byproduct, according to a 2019 study in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health (opens in new tab) — that formed thousands of years ago. They spied sea anemones, sponges, corals, starfish, sea spiders and diverse crustaceans.  The only other known mud volcano in Norwegian waters is the Håkon Mosby volcano. This 0.6-mile-wide (1 km) feature was discovered 4,100 feet (1,250 m) below the water’s surface on the seabed south of Svalbard in 1995, according to the University of Bergen's Center for Geobiology (opens in new tab). Underwater mud volcanoes are difficult to spot and map, but researchers estimate there could be hundreds or thousands of them on the seafloor globally, according to a 2021 chapter in Lecture Notes in Earth System Sciences (opens in new tab).  These volcanoes provide a rare window into geological processes occurring deep below Earth's crust, since they spout mainly water, minerals and fine sediment from these depths. They also offer clues about previous environments and conditions on Earth, and could give an insight into systems on other planets, Panieri said."

Eyewitness News heard from his daughter, who is looking for help.  “He doesn’t look the same, it makes me sad and I want him to get better soon,” said Marissa Webber Kennan, Stephen’s daughter.  The past five days for Marissa have been draining.  Stephen, the rock of the Webber family, is in extreme pain.  “He can’t use both of his hands at all. He has broken bones on almost all of his fingers. His wrist is shattered the other hand is broken,” Marissa said.  He also has a broken arm, ribs, even burns and cuts on his face.  Thursday morning at Stephen’s repair shop, Sandman Automotive, he and another man were working on a home heating oil tank, using a plasma cutter.  Then there was a noise which was heard up to two miles away.  “You wouldn’t believe the sound that came it was just a huge explosion,” said Brian Daigle, who works nearby.  The two men were rushed to the hospital.  It’s unclear how the second man is doing tonight.  “It was very scary he doesn’t look like my dad because he’s all bandaged up here and his face is very swollen,” said Marissa.  The plan is for Stephen to have surgery next week.  He’ll be out of work for at least a few months. The family needs help, not only with medical bills, but the loss of income at Sandman.  They’ve set up a Go Fund Me page and the community has already sent them more than $13,000.  “He can’t do anything without the help of my mom now or us if we help,” Marissa said. “I’m floored by that amount of money to help.”  Copyright 2023 WFSB.

The explosion, which occurred 8 billion light years away from Earth billions of years ago, has been erupting for three years without any signs of slowing down. Although scientists at first struggled to determine the cause of the cosmic blast, which they have named AT2021lwx, they now think the culprit is a supermassive black hole that came in contact with a gargantuan cloud of gas. That’s according to findings recently published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.  Stretching across a space that is 100 times the size of our solar system, the black hole formation is currently giving off 100 times more energy than the sun will emit over the course of its entire 10-billion-year lifetime.  The explosion itself is far from Earth, but its discovery could help scientists better understand black holes, which sit at the center of many galaxies, including our own.  “It really seems like, especially when they have time to do some more modeling, this will be an important step in understanding what’s happening in the middle of galaxies,” says Jonathan Blazek, a physics professor at Northeastern University.  Astronomers at the Zwicky Transient Facility in California originally discovered AT2021lwx in 2020 but struggled to suss out the exact cause of such a massive explosion. AT2021lwx was emitting too much light for too long to fit any known category of astronomical phenomenon, whether it was a supernova, aka an exploding star, or a tidal disruption, which occurs when a star has been pulled into a black hole and destroyed.  Eventually, NASA’s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, Chile’s New Technology Telescope and Spain’s Gran Telescopio Canarias were all brought online to aid in studying AT2021lwx. With all these telescopes pointed at AT2021lwx, astronomers eventually identified the black hole-related explanation they have settled on in their findings.  Blazek says the astrophysical qualities of a black hole definitely are primed to cause an explosion at this scale. Once a black hole gets large enough, it creates such a gravitational whirlpool that it starts sucking in anything that’s close to it, growing in the process. Anything that crosses the event horizon, the point of no return, and falls into the black hole is gone––it will never be seen or heard from again. That includes light.  So, how does a black hole cause an explosion with enough light to be seen billions of light years away by scientists on Earth?  “Because these are such big, extreme objects, you can have some pretty big, extreme things happening just outside the event horizon,” Blazek says.  The pull of a black hole is so strong that anything caught in its wake gets accelerated to the point where it’s moving near the speed of light, creating swirling, rapidly moving particles that are bumping into each other.  “You get really, really, really hot material outside the event horizon of the blackhole, and this really hot material can emit a lot of energy,” Blazek says. “It turns out the most efficient way to get energy out of mass is to drop it into a black hole.”  According to Blazek, there is a whole class of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) that are powered this way. Mass falls into a black hole, it gets shredded at high velocities and emits a ton of energy. But typically those kinds of events create a steadily increasing amount of energy and light that scientists can observe. That wasn’t the case here.  “They can find no evidence that this was active before, so their best theory is that this was a blackhole about a billion solar masses [large] that was just sitting there quietly because nothing was around to fall in,” he says. “Then, they think a big mass of gas got too close and pretty quickly got shredded and fell in.”  Blazek says this explosion has similarities to other cosmic phenomena, like AGNs, but it’s the differences that make the discovery so exciting.  Blazek says understanding more about the nature of black holes could help with his own work, which involves using galaxies and the movement of mass through the universe to map the cosmos. Black holes are instrumental in moving all kinds of matter through outer space. Although astronomers have learned a lot about black holes, there is still much that isn’t known about how supermassive black holes are created. By further studying an event like this cosmic explosion, scientists could unlock even more about these powerful cosmic forces and the nature of our galaxy as well.  “We don’t fully understand how these things grow, especially early on in their lives,” Blazek says. “If we see an event where a cloud of more than 1,000 solar masses is falling onto a black hole, in the sort of event we didn’t know could happen, that could be an important piece of this puzzle.”  Cody Mello-Klein is a Northeastern Global News reporter.

The explosive event labeled AT2021lwx was observed to be ten times brighter than any known supernova, the explosions that occur as massive stars die. And whereas supernova explosions only last a few months, this explosive event has been raging for at least three years.  AT2021lwx is also three times brighter than the light that is emitted as stars are ripped apart and devoured by supermassive black holes, occurrences called ""tidal disruption events"" or ""TDEs."" The blast is around 8 billion light-years from Earth and thus occurred when the universe was just 6 billion years old.  AT2021lwx was first spotted by the Zwicky Transient Facility in California in 2020 and was then picked up by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) based in Hawaii. Both of these systems are designed to survey the night sky for astronomical events that rapidly change in brightness over time, also known as ""transients."" This change in brightness can indicate a supernova or a gamma-ray burst (GRB) deep in the universe or something much closer to home like a comet or an asteroid.  Though it was spotted by these facilities three years ago, the sheer scale and power of the explosion AT2021lwx were unknown until now.  ""We came upon this by chance, as it was flagged by our search algorithm when we were searching for a type of supernova,"" University of Southampton research fellow Philip Wiseman, who led the research, said in an emailed statement. ""Most supernovae and TDEs only last for a couple of months before fading away. For something to be bright for two plus years was immediately very unusual.""  Wiseman and the team of astronomers think that AT2021lwx may be the result of a black hole violently disrupting a cloud of gas with a mass thousands of times greater than the sun. As it did so, the black hole swallowed fragments of the gas cloud, sending shockwaves into both what remains of the gas and into a wider donut-shaped torus of dust surrounding it, causing them to emit bright electromagnetic radiation.  Events like this have been witnessed before, they are rare. What's more, none that have been witnessed previously have been on the scale of AT2021lwx.  While AT2021lwx isn't actually as bright as the gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A spotted by astronomers in 2022, this event that erupted from 2.4 billion light-years away lasted for just ten hours after detection. Even though that is quite long for a GRB, it means that AT2021lwx has put out far more energy over its entire lifetime than this gamma-ray burst did in its own.  Measuring the power of a cosmic explosion  Following its initial discovery, the team of researchers behind this discovery continued to examine AT2021lwx using several different telescopes including the Neil Gehrels Swift Telescope, the New Technology Telescope in Chile, and the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, Spain.  Following these observations, the researchers took the spectrum of light that was emitted from the event and split it down into its constituent wavelengths, measuring how light was emitted and absorbed around the event. This allowed the researchers to calculate the distance to the source of AT2021lwx.  ""Once you know the distance to the object and how bright it appears to us, you can calculate the brightness of the object at its source,"" team member and University of Southampton professor Sebastian Hönig said in the statement. ""Once we'd performed those calculations, we realized this is extremely bright.""  The only thing in the known universe that is as bright as AT2021lwx are supermassive black holes. When these black holes feed on stellar gases that fall into them at high velocities, they can let off incredibly bright emissions known as quasars.  ""With a quasar, we see the brightness flickering up and down over time,"" team member and University of Southampton professor Mark Sullivan added. ""But looking back over a decade there was no detection of AT2021lwx, then suddenly it appears with the brightness of the brightest things in the universe, which is unprecedented.""  Though there are other possible explanations for the explosive event, the astronomers currently favor the explanation that sees an extremely large cloud of mostly gaseous hydrogen or dust that was knocked from its orbit around the black hole and sucked into it. This will only be conclusively determined when the team has collected more data about AT2021lwx.  The team will now look at the explosion in different wavelengths of light including X-rays. Doing so could reveal the temperature of the event and what processes are driving it. They will also conduct computer simulations to discover if their model of a titanic gas cloud disrupted by a black hole could account for AT2021lwx.  ""With new facilities, like the Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time, coming online in the next few years, we are hoping to discover more events like this and learn more about them,"" Wiseman concluded in the statement. ""It could be that these events, although extremely rare, are so energetic that they are key processes to how the centers of galaxies change over time.""

But does the current bout of brightening presage Betelgeuse blowing its top? And what would such a nearby supernova look like?  "

During this, the police also brought the main accused of the blasts, Azadbir Singh, to the spot. The entire scene was recreated by Azadbir Singh under the supervision of the police. Not only this, the angle from which the photograph was taken was also scrutinised.  Police officials were not allowed to capture the scene for the media. At present, all five accused are being interrogated by the Crime Investigation Agency (CIA).  During the investigation, it was found that before the blast and arrest, Azadbir Singh of Baba Bakala had spent a day in Tarn Taran and Gurdaspur respectively. The police suspect that Azadbir Singh had links with the smugglers involved in cross-border drug smuggling.  The police are also investigating the call details and call locations of Azadbir Singh and Amrik Singh for the last three months to know their links, contacts and area of the movement.  It is worth mentioning here that Azadbir Singh, Amrik Singh, firecracker dealer Sahib Singh alias Saba, Dharminder Singh and Harpreet Singh were arrested by the police for their alleged involvement in the three blasts near the Golden Temple last week.

At first the tremors, which were registered on Saturday, were thought to have been caused by earthquakes.  Then, seismologists theorised that they originated from controlled explosions in Poland, almost 90 miles to the south, as part of military exercises.  But they are still not certain of the true origin of the unexplained geological phenomenon.  FILE PHOTO: Gas leak at Nord Stream 2 as seen from the Danish F-16 interceptor on Bornholm, Denmark September 27, 2022  On Monday, the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, an official body that monitors the underground, said the tremors were 'not caused by earthquakes, but by pressure waves from an event in the atmosphere.'  However, they came from 'an unknown source.'  'The seismologists can report that it is unlikely that the tremors originate from a controlled explosion in Poland, which was carried out shortly before the first reports of tremors on Bornholm,' the body known as GEUS said in a statement.  On Saturday, GEUS said it had received 'more than 60' tips from people on Bornholm that 'earthquake-like tremors' - described as a deep rumbling, shaking and rattling, changing pressure in the ear - had been reported in the afternoon on Bornholm.  This map, created shortly after the leaks in the Nord Stream pipeline were detected, shows the location of the Danish island of Bornholm  Police said they too were contacted by members of the public about the tremor on the eastern part of the island.  Danish media reported that the tremors caused a crack in the wall of a house, but no one was hurt.  GEUS said that seismic tremors were measured at a magnitude of 2.3.  Polish authorities have said that there was intensive activity during the Anakonda23 exercise in Ustka, northern Poland, involving jet fighters and live firing of artillery munitions.  GEUS, an independent research and advisory institution within Denmark's Ministry of Climate, Energy and Utilities, said that it had two seismographs on Bornholm that collect data around the clock.  Bornholm, home to nearly 40,000 people, is a rocky island in the Baltic Sea, south of Sweden, northeast of Germany and north of Poland."

Well, that’s not strictly true – to be more accurate, something truly gargantuan happened in space approximately 8 billion years ago, that we are only just finding out about now. Last Friday, scientists revealed the largest cosmic explosion ever witnessed: like a supernova, but more than 10 times brighter and more powerful than any other seen before. And its cause? A giant cloud of gas being sucked into a supermassive black hole.  If you want people to be excited about something, it’s important to come up with a catchy name. So, taking a leaf out of Elon Musk’s book of baby names, scientists called it AT2021lwx. But I’m gonna call her Sue. Sue Pernova. (You’re welcome.)  Sue had humble beginnings. She started out like the damp patch in the corner of your bathroom – small and barely noticeable, then over the course of time growing into something monstrous and without precedent. It was only when scientists established just how distant Sue was (8 billion lightyears) that they realised quite how much energy she must be burning to produce a light so bright.  01:17 ‘Absolutely gargantuan’: astrophysicist explains largest cosmic explosion ever witnessed – video  This is all well and good, I hear you cry, but why should I care? Sue seems great, but she lives miles away and besides I’m far too busy having to do the weekly shop, picking up the kids from school and Googling “black mould removal”. Well, I’ve been a space superfan since I was old enough to say “Houston we have a problem”, so you don’t have to convince me to care. But space can give us an insight into our existence.  There are certain aspects of space exploration that are easy to defend. Like the Dart mission last year which successfully tested technology designed to shift an asteroid off its course, protecting Earth and its inhabitants from a fatal collision. Most of us have a vested interest in the Earth not being smashed to smithereens, so it’s great to know that Nasa is on the case.  Some of the other stuff, though, is far more abstract and, for want of a better word, nerdy. But the truth is, every time something like this happens it puts another piece in the puzzle of understanding where we came from and where we will go.  We all know some basic things about the universe and our solar system from our school days: Jupiter has its raging stormy eye, Saturn has its rings, and Pluto has an identity crisis about its latest reclassification. But what you perhaps didn’t know, because they only found out recently, is that Saturn didn’t always have its rings.  A study from the University of Colorado suggests that the rings are only 400 million years old, with Saturn being nearer 4.5 billion years in age. Those figures are quite hard to get your head around, but if you scale that timeline down, it’s the equivalent of an 85-year-old bloke called Stanley deciding to grow a mo-hawk at 81. That’s a pretty wild and late-stage development, right? Certainly not something to define his whole existence by.  In the even blinkier-blink of an eye that is the period of human existence, we happen to have magically coincided with this beautiful phenomenon. Us being here now at the same time of Saturn’s rings is a delightful coincidence: a reminder that everything is fleeting, everything is changing, even in the universe.  Someone sent me a meme recently with a picture of the galaxy and an arrow pointing to a barely visible dot labelled “You, crying in the shower”. Apart from being very funny, it’s also very true (the crying bit, certainly). I find the underlying message of it weirdly profound. We are all so very small and the universe is so very big and almost all of our hopes, dreams and fears are entirely trivial.  If that doesn’t sound particularly comforting, stick with me. In 2009, Nasa released captures from the Hubble telescope showing the deepest image of the universe ever taken to date, allowing you to scroll in and out of hundreds of galaxies and solar systems that seemingly go on for ever. If you ever need a moment of profound perspective, that does it.  Cosmically speaking, if we are all insignificant, then everything we do is almost in defiance of that. It renders the choices we make simultaneously meaningless and also the most wonderful act of living; one more beautiful addition to an already improbable existence. That’s a pretty liberating thought. It’s all connected. Like it or not, we’re all part of a kind of celestial foxtrot: expanding, contracting, dying and being reborn.  So next time you hear about something happening a million miles away, think about how you’re a small part of that and how incredible it is to exist. Why not look out of your window tonight – maybe you’ll see the light from some supernova long since gone. And who knows, perhaps someone 8 billion lightyears away will be looking back from their damp, damp, bathroom, seeing the dead light from our sun and wondering about their own place in the universe."

A Nets fan, James yearns for the days of yesteryear, when playoffs were all but irrelevant and the likes of Caris Levert and Jarrett Allen were running the show.  Philadelphia 76ers coach Doc Rivers has been on the wrong end of plenty of dominant Game 7 performances, but Jayson Tatum’s explosion on Sunday night ranks right at the top, according to the man himself.  Tatum was simply unstoppable in the series-deciding matchup, putting up a mammoth 51 points on 17-28 shooting while also grabbing 13 boards and dishing out five assists en route to a 112-88 victory. James Harden faltered – again – and so too did Joel Embiid, but Tatum was the clear difference-maker throughout the course of the game.  In the wake of the defeat, Tatum’s performance was ranked by Rivers as one of the absolute best, saying that the only game which compares was LeBron James’ Game 6 effort against his Boston Celtics in 2012.

But James had other ideas. He hit an incredible 19 of his 26 shots, ending the game with 45 points, 15 rebounds and five assists to lead the Heat to victory.  11 years on, clearly Doc Rivers hasn’t forgotten that night, and it doesn’t appear likely that he’ll forget this one in a hurry either. His Game 7 record of 6-10 will be the subject of plenty of discussion over the coming days, and rightly or wrongly, will no doubt have plenty of aggrieved Sixers fans politely suggesting their team finds a new coach.  Incidentally, after LeBron James’ historic performance in 2012, the Heat went on to win Game 7 and with it the series, before beating the Oklahoma City Thunder in five games to win the championship. The Celtics will be hoping that Jayson Tatum’s performance leads to the same result."

But a flurry of hard hit balls and two big innings from its senior leaders allowed it to crawl back and earn the decisive victory.  The Wolverines (26-22 overall, 13-8 Big Ten) prevailed on senior day behind the power of their bats to sweep Northwestern (8-38, 3-18) by a score of 15-5.  Coming off of a Big Ten Pitcher of the Week performance against Minnesota, senior left-hander Jacob Denner looked to stay hot on the mound. But, stymied early by the Wildcats’ offense, Michigan entered an early hole, giving up two runs quickly in the first inning.  With Denner unable to replicate his dominance from a week ago in the early innings, the Wolverines needed their bats to keep them in the game — and they delivered. In the bottom of the third inning the bats unleashed, as back-to-back doubles from graduate shortstop Cody Jefferis and senior second baseman Ted Burton drove in two RBI to bring Michigan within one run.  “I like a hot Teddy,” Michigan coach Tracy Smith said. “When he’s hot, he’s fun to watch. That’s what your older guys are supposed to do, is lead by example and through their play. He’s doing an excellent job of that.”  But the best was still to come for the Wolverines.  The next inning, senior third baseman Brandon Lawrence ignited a two-out onslaught with an RBI single, followed by home runs from Jefferis and Burton — Jefferis’ first homer of the season and Burton’s third in just this series. Michigan entered the bottom of the fourth down by one, but exited up by four.  After the early blows, the Wolverines used the crucial bottom of the fourth inning to retake all momentum, only needing to close out the rest of the game — and series.  Continuing that momentum, Denner’s pitching began to smooth, allowing just two more runs in the top of the seventh before handing off to senior right-hander John Torroella with a three run Michigan lead.  “Even with the hits, (Denner) didn’t give up much solid contact,” Smith said. “Following up his unbelievable performance from last week is what we’re gonna need him to do.”  While not equal to his career best performance last weekend, Denner still kept the Wolverines in position to hold their lead.  While the lead was safe at the time of Denner’s exit, it needed insurance. And that is where Jefferis re-enters the equation.  With the bases loaded in the bottom of the eighth inning, the senior roped a triple down the right field line. The hit scored all three runners, bolstering a six-run inning to close out a cycle performance at the plate for Jefferis.  “That really spread it open there,” Smith said. “Not only did it give him the cycle, but we were just saying, ‘Gosh, we need one more run just to kind of get away,’ … so the triple was big.”  He delivered the knockout shot. By piling on six runs in the seventh inning, Michigan had replicated and gone beyond what it did in its dominant fourth inning. The game was no longer in reach for Northwestern and the Wolverines achieved their lead on the backs of their seniors.  Earning the series sweep against the Wildcats is essential to Michigan’s hopes of another Big Ten Tournament run. And the final victory on Sunday shows that the Wolverines’ bats are heating up at just the right time."

The 6-foot-3 Lewis, a 2024 four-star point guard who received an Orange scholarship offer in late April, has put up several massive performances this weekend in grassroots basketball. That’s after he displayed his elite scoring prowess last month amid two NCAA live periods on the AAU circuit.  In his first two games this weekend, Lewis combined for 55 points in just 48 minutes of total action. He led his squad, the Oakland, Calif.-based Oakland Soldiers in Nike’s EYBL league, to a pair of blowout wins.  2024 Oakland Soldiers (CA) G Mikey Lewis (@MikeyLewis05): 29 PTS (5 3PTM), 5 REB, 2 AST in a win over The Family @Soldiers_Salute #EYBL Top performers ⤵️https://t.co/2gG4Pvehr5 pic.twitter.com/ANTGDWYp0Y — The Circuit (@TheCircuit) May 13, 2023  So far this spring in grassroots basketball, Lewis has proven one of the top all-around performers across all of the shoe-sponsored AAU leagues.  Syracuse basketball 2024 four-star target Mikey Lewis is a scoring machine.  This past Friday through Sunday, the EYBL is holding its third spring session at the Southwest Athletic Center in Carrollton, Texas.  According to the EYBL Web site, on Friday evening, the Oakland Soldiers defeated the Detroit-based The Family, 79-67.  In 28 minutes, Lewis tallied 29 points, five rebounds and two assists. He connected on 9-of-16 from the field, 5-of-10 from beyond the arc and 6-of-6 from the free-throw line.  On Saturday morning, the Oakland Soldiers crushed the Miami-based Nightrydas Elite by a final count of 91-70. In this victory, Lewis recorded 26 points, three boards, one assist and three steals in only 20 minutes.  He hit on 8-of-14 from the field, 5-of-8 from downtown and 5-of-5 from the charity stripe.  In late April, when the EYBL held two sessions during live periods, Lewis produced scoring outbursts of 34 points, 22 points, 22 points, 23 points and 28 points, among others.  During the first live-period session last month, at the LakePoint Champions Center in Emerson, Ga., he led the EYBL in scoring at 25.3 points per contest.  This spring, through his first 10 games on the AAU circuit, Lewis is averaging 21.5 points, 4.5 rebounds, 2.5 assists and 28.1 minutes per game, while connecting on 46.1 percent from the field, 45.5 percent from 3-point land and 85.9 percent from the free-throw line. That’s impressive.  In his games on Saturday night and Sunday morning, Lewis scored 11 points and 6 points, respectively, over a combined 47 minutes. The Oakland Soldiers went 1-1 in these contests.

Astronomers recently reported the observation of what appeared to be a large gas planet being eaten up by its aging star. The team said the sun-like star had been expanding for a very long time and finally got so big that it swallowed the nearby planet.  The researchers who made the observations said the star is in our Milky Way galaxy, about 12,000 light years from Earth. A light year is the distance light travels in a year – about 9.5 trillion kilometers. The findings were recently reported in a study published in Nature.  Most planets are believed to meet the end of their life when the star they are orbiting runs out of energy. This process causes the star to turn into a “red giant” that grows very large. The star can then swallow up the planet, and anything else that nears it.  The scientists say the planet’s destruction happened between 10,000 and 15,000 years ago near the Aquila constellation. At that time, the star was around 10 billion years old. The team said the swallowing event created a hot explosion of light, followed by a large release of dust that shot out into space.  Kishalay De is a researcher from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He discovered the light explosion by accident in 2020. He was examining data captured by the Palomar Observatory, based near San Diego, California.  De said he was surprised to observe a star that had suddenly increased in brightness by more than 100 times over a period of 10 days. He had been searching for binary star systems. These are sets of two stars that orbit around a common center of mass. When the larger of the stars takes bites out of the other, a bright explosion called an “outburst” happens.  But De said his examinations suggested the outburst was surrounded by cold gas, meaning it could not be a binary system. He learned from another space telescope that the star had also started releasing large amounts of dust months before the outburst.  While scientists had observed past star expansions, this was the first time they have been able to observe a complete planet-swallowing event.  The researchers said the collected data showed the swallowed planet was a “gas giant” with a similar mass to the planet Jupiter. They noted that the planet had become so close to its star that it could complete a full orbit in just one day.  The planet is believed to have “engulfed” the planet over a period of around 100 days, the team said. The bright explosion happened in the final 10 days as the planet was totally destroyed.  Miguel Montarges is an astronomer at the Paris Observatory who was not involved in the research. He told the French news agency AFP the star was thousands of degrees hotter than the planet when the destruction happened. He explained, ""It's like putting an ice cube into a boiling pot.""  Astronomers say the same event is expected to happen to other planets – including Mercury, Venus and Earth. De said our sun will likely reach its red giant period in about 5 billion years.  Astronomers do not know if more planets are circling the star at a safer distance. If so, De said they may have thousands of years before also getting swallowed up.  Now that they know what to look for, the researchers will be looking for more similar events. They believe thousands of planets around other stars will likely suffer the same fate as this one did.  Morgan MacLeod is a postdoctoral researcher at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Massachusetts. He told Reuters news agency he finds it “humbling” to think about our own planet facing the same destruction. MacLeod noted that since Earth is much smaller, its destruction will not cause such an outburst.  “When Earth is eventually swallowed, the sun will hardly notice,"" he said.  I’m Bryan Lynn.

Most of the improvisations have saved them money and helped to keep heads above water.  However, the new way of boycotting the high cost of cooking gas cylinders may cost lives than it can save money.  Economy&Lifestyle discovered that the cost of gas cylinders has risen so high that it becomes difficult for average homes to afford and still fill them with gas.  The situation becomes worse when considering that the pump price of kerosene, which would have been an alternative, is prohibitive.  Checks show that the price of cylinders varies according to the sizes. A 3kg gas cylinder costs N14,000, 5kg-N16,000 6kg – N17,000 and 12.5kg costs N19,000. Filling the cylinders with cooking gas also costs N2,600 for 3kg, N5,200 for 6kg, N8,950 for 10.5kg and N10,650 for 12.5 kg.  This means that an average home with a worn-out 5kg will need N20,250 to buy a new one and fill it, which is hard to come by.  So, the resolve is to refurbish the old ones and still manage them. However, that is where the danger is.  Mrs. Rukayat Adesoji, a trader, said her gas cylinder got rusted and no longer stands erect since last month, but due to high cost of purchasing the cylinders, she took it to a welder who patched the legs, repainted it, and since then, she has been using it.  “My gas cylinder which was 6kg got rusted and no longer stands erect since last month. When I asked for the price, I was told it was N17, 500. I was discussing it with a friend who advised me to take it to a welder to paint it and construct a new stand. I heeded to her advice and at the end spent just N3, 000 to turn my cooking gas to a brand new.”  Apart from refurbishing cylinders, some people don’t even know when their cylinders will expire. Mrs. Mercy Opara, a hair stylist, fell in that category as she explained: “I am taking my gas cylinder to the welder to spray it for me. It just cost N1, 500. The cost of buying a new cylinder is high. I have been using my cylinder for over 7 years and I don’t even know the expiry date. I just pray God blesses me so that I can buy a new one. But this one I am managing will look neat after spraying it for another two years.”  Mr. Adekanbi Joseph, a wielder, said he paints cylinder and “To paint and rebuild a cylinder stand, I charge N4, 500. Many people come here to paint as a new cylinder is now very expensive to get.”  Explaining the danger in using refurbished cylinders, The Chief Executive Officer, FKT Cooking gas and general goods, Mr. Benjamin Hope said: “A brand new cylinder can explode if the locks are not well keyed after using and if the cylinder filled with gas was moved from one place.  “There are many reasons for the high cost of gas cylinders in Nigeria. One is the cost of importation due to the exchange rate. Another is the increased migration from the use of kerosene to cooking gas which has necessitated increased demand for gas cylinders.  “You know that in such a case there will be increased importation of cylinders.”"

The model was also seen toting around a mini backpack in a gray leather fabric and gold hardware  Pop of color: The bartender — who slammed Raquel Leviss in the explosive trailer for the season ten reunion of the hit Bravo series — donned a pair of fluorescent neon yellow, fuzzy slippers  Radiant: She donned a dazzling diamond statement ring on her hand with a stunning, long, and taupe manicure  Hands full: As she stepped out of a car, the actress had her hands full with her cell phone and a portable mug  Tense: Earlier last week, fans of Vanderpump Rules caught a sneak peek of the tense season ten three-part reunion  Drama: In the trailer, Madix called out her now-ex, Tom Sandoval, 39, and slammed his mistress for being 'diabolical, demented, and subhuman'  In the preview, Madix also called her ex and his on-again, off-again lover 'f***ing rats' and said they shouldn't expect 'anything good coming for them.'  In the episode, James Kennedy, 31 — who was previously engaged to Leviss — also called Sandoval a 'backstabbing ho' for sleeping with his ex-fiancée.  After an explosive back-and-forth, Kennedy then fired back at Sandoval and called him 'a worm with a mustache' — which fans quickly took to social media to make into memes.  The first episode of the explosive reunion is set to premiere later this month on May 24."

He also co-hosts Cash Considerations: A Chicago Bulls Podcast for the Blue Wire Network.  Boston Celtics head coach Joe Mazzulla changed his starting lineup for Game 6 against the Philadelphia 76ers, inserting big man Robert Williams III and moving Derrick White to the bench. While the Celtics were on the ropes in the fourth quarter and needed both a late Jayson Tatum explosion and Sixers collapse to win, the move undoubtedly worked given Boston’s fast start to the game and Williams’ plus-18 in the box score. Because of this, it’s no surprise Mazzulla is sticking with this lineup for Sunday’s Game 7.  Mazzulla spoke to the media before the do-or-die game and confirmed he will keep the two-big starting lineup in place against Joel Embiid and Co., per ESPN’s Tim Bontemps. That means it will be Williams, Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart and Al Horford going up against Philly.  Williams played 28 minutes in Game 6, his highest playing time of the series. The big man was under 20 minutes in the prior three games and had played a high of 22 points in Game 2 before Game 6. He made his presence known with 10 points, nine rebounds and two blocks in those 28 minutes. And, again, the Celtics outscored the Sixers by 18 points when Williams was on the court.

If they can get up early and get the crowd into it, the Sixers will be in big trouble. It’s going to be a fascinating Game 7 with an Eastern Conference Finals date against the Miami Heat on the line."

The photographer, Boris Eldagsen, openly admitted that the image was AI generated and refused to accept the award, saying he had entered it to start a debate over whether an AI-generated image could in fact be a photograph.  The stunt was a response to an explosion in readily accessible AI tools. Last November’s launch of ChatGPT was, on the face of it, one of the most momentous technological advances in recent years. A text-based system, ChatGPT can write stories, college essays, job applications and so on in clear, fluent language and, if the user so chooses, in the style of Shakespeare, Donald Trump or Chaucer.  It clocked up over 100 million users in the first two months after launch, making it the fastest growing consumer application in history. And, less than four months after ChatGPT hit the headlines, OpenAI, the developer, launched GPT-4, the successor to GPT-3, the artificial intelligence system on which ChatGPT is based."
