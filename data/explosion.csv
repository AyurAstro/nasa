The company also said it expects Q2 revenue to come in at about $11 billion, plus or minus 2%. Wall Street was expecting $7.2 billion.  Nvidia is at the center of the AI explosion thanks to its high-powered graphics cards and server products, and its stock price is soaring. Over the last year, shares of Nvidia have jumped 77%, while rival AMD (AMD) has jumped 12%. Intel (INTC) shares are down 30% in the same timeframe.  Here are the most important numbers from the report compared to what was expected, as compiled by Bloomberg.  Revenue: $7.2 billion versus $6.5 billion expected  Adj. EPS: $1.09 versus $0.92 expected  Gaming: $2.2 billion versus $1.9 billion expected  Data center: $4.2 billion versus $3.9 billion expected  Shares of Nvidia were up more than 13% following the announcement.  “The computer industry is going through two simultaneous transitions — accelerated computing and generative AI,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement.  “A trillion dollars of installed global data center infrastructure will transition from general purpose to accelerated computing as companies race to apply generative AI into every product, service and business process.""  While shares of Nvidia are riding the AI wave, thanks to the introduction of OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Microsoft (MSFT) and Google’s (GOOG, GOOGL) own generative AI efforts, the company is still contending with a vicious slowdown in the gaming industry.  Much of that has to do with the broader downturn in consumer spending on electronics following the explosive growth the industry experienced during the pandemic. With nothing to do but sit at home, consumers bought up graphics cards and similarly equipped PCs to pass the time.  Now that gamers have those systems in their hands, however, there’s little reason to upgrade anytime soon. Intel and AMD are experiencing the same kind of problems with their own client computing groups.  Nvidia reporter better than expected results after the bell Wednesday. REUTERS/Mike Blake  But the slowdown should be coming to an end soon. Wall Street expects Nvidia to post revenue growth in its gaming business for the first time in a year in Q2, according to Bloomberg data. That would go a long way to helping Nvidia’s overall revenue growth after a third consecutive quarter-over-quarter decline as of Q1.  Sign up for the Yahoo Finance newsletter.

Speaking to reporters after a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Atomic Energy Organization of Iran Director Mohammad Eslami insisted that the government would cooperate with international inspectors on any “new activities.”  “The Islamic Republic of Iran is working under the IAEA safeguards, and whenever it wants to start new activities, it will coordinate with the IAEA, and act accordingly,” Eslami said, referring to the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.  He made the remarks following an Associated Press report that showed the regime is building a deep underground nuclear facility near the Zagros Mountains in central Iran, close to the Natanz nuclear site, with experts claiming development “is likely beyond the range of a last-ditch US weapon designed to destroy such sites.""  Describing the new claims as “bogus” and “a psychological operation” originated by Israel, Eslami added that whenever Israel finds itself stuck in difficult situations in the region, it “intensifies these psychological operations more and more."" He did not elaborate on what he meant by a difficult situation.  The report analyzed expert opinions as well as satellite imagery from Planet Labs PBC to prove Iran’s activities near the Natanz nuclear site, which has come under repeated sabotage attacks amid Tehran’s standoff with the West over its atomic program. According to experts, photographs of the piles of dirt from the excavations suggest the new tunnels will be between 80 meters (260 feet) and 100 meters (328 feet) deep.  Satellite view of Iran's Natanz nuclear facility  The report sparked wider conversation across the Middle East about the construction, with Israel’s national security adviser saying Tuesday the site would not be immune from attack even if its depth put it out of range of American airstrikes. Lieutenant-General Herzi Halevi, chief of Israel's armed forces raised the prospect of ""action"" against Iran, warning that ""Iran has advanced with uranium enrichment further than ever before ... There are negative developments on the horizon that could bring about (military) action.”  The US Air Force released rare images of the weapon, the GBU-57, known as the “Massive Ordnance Penetrator,” designed to destroy weapons of mass destruction located in well protected facilities. However, it immediately took the photos down because they revealed sensitive details about the weapon’s composition and punch.  Natanz, about 225 kilometers (140 miles) south of Tehran, has been a point of international concern since its existence became known two decades ago. This is not the first time reports surface about Iran building a vast tunnel network near Natanz, purportedly able to withstand cyberattacks and bunker-penetrating bombs.  The Islamic Republic claims the new construction will replace an above-ground centrifuge manufacturing center at Natanz struck by an explosion and fire in July 2020.  Last year, the spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, Behrouz Kamalvandi, reacted to a report by the New York Times revealing underground work, claiming Iran had notified the UN nuclear agency of its plan to relocate the activities of the Iran Centrifuge Technology Company (TESA) complex in Karaj to the city of Natanz.  He claimed the move aimed to prevent the recurrence of attacks, referring to a recent drone attack at the TESA complex near Karaj which manufactures parts for centrifuges.  Over the years, a series of attacks has seemed to slow Iran’s nuclear activities. In 2010, the Natanz uranium enrichment facility suffered serious damage following a major cyber-attack involving the Stuxnet virus. Three years later, the Fordow enrichment site was rocked by an explosion. More recently, in July 2020, a centrifuge assembly facility was hit by an explosion and in April 2021 an explosion at the enrichment plant caused a power outage that reportedly damaged thousands of centrifuges.

Vernon softball slugs their way to state quarterfinals, semifinals, finals  Lady Mt'neers played for state championship Tuesday  The Mt. Vernon Lady Mt'neer softball team's 13-3 win over Sparta Tuesday, May 16, set up a state semifinal showdown with a Fair Grove team that Mt. Vernon already beat 12-2 back in April. However, the stakes were much higher Monday night in the state's Final Four matchup.  The Lady Eagles struck first in front of a rambunctious crowd at Killian Sports Complex in Springfield as they truly manufactured a run, after a walk and an error set up a pick-off attempt that allowed the runner to score. However, Mt. Vernon found themselves in this position before. Mt. Vernon threatened in the bottom of the first and in the second, but Fair Grove was able to work out of trouble. The Lady Eagles got a sacrifice fly after a lead-off double in the third inning to give Fair Grove a 2-0 lead.  The explosive powder keg that is the Lady Mt’neers' offense had their biggest explosion of the season in the bottom of the third inning starting with singles from Ally Burk, Payge Evans and Molly Daniels. Allie Schubert hit a sac fly bringing in Burk. As the pitcher was walking back to the mound, Evans noticed there was no one covering home and stole home to tie the game at two.  Ten of the next 11 Mt. Vernon batters would have RBI hits starting with a triple from sophomore Rae Downing. Cheyenne Bieber brought Downing home on the next pitch. Then doubles from Stokes, Burk and Evans opened the flood gates to the tune of 8-1. Four straight singles from Molly Daniels, Allie Schubert, Harley Daniels and Rae Downing followed by a Bieber walk extended the lead to nine, 11-2, in favor of the Lady Mt’neers. Stokes put a ball into right to conclude the scoring in the 11-run third inning as Mt. Vernon took the 13-2 lead after three innings.  Hurler Harley Daniels would look nearly unstoppable on the mound for the next two innings and a fly ball to Cheyenne Bieber in the top of the fifth inning would conclude a dominating victory for the Lady Mt’neers, 13-2, and the Lady Mt’neers are feeling that this is a team of destiny.  “I am feeling confident,"" said sophomore Rae Downing. ""The Diamond game (in the district championship) was really tough, but since then it has been a run-rule in Sparta and another one here today. West County is a good team so we can't overlook them but we are feeling good.”  The Lady Mt’neers boast an overall record of 36-1, and a date with 24-3 West County remaining with a state title on the line. Mt. Vernon met up with the Lady Bulldogs once before early in the year, where the Lady Mt’neers gave West County their first loss of the season, 11-1. The game saw Harley Daniels do damage on both sides of the plate. She threw five innings of one-run ball while collecting three hits, two doubles good for two RBI’s. Payge Evans also had a 3-4 day with a triple and two RBI’s and Downing was a perfect 3-3 with a triple and an RBI.  If Mt. Vernon can keep the hot bats rolling, you have to like the odds of the No. 1 team in the state completing their season of destiny.

On March 03, 2023 Patently Apple posted a patent report titled ""An Apple micro-LED Display patent describes integrating features such as Fingerprint & Health Sensing, Water Tolerant Touch & more."" Then in late April we posted a report titled ""Will Apple launch an Apple Watch Ultra with a MicroLED Display in 2024 or 2025?"" That report also covered a newly created microLED dream team formed in Taiwan led by Apple supplier AUO.  A new supply chain report this morning states that MicroLED display shipments are expected to grow rapidly in 2025. 2025 is the year Apple is expected to apply microLED for the first time to the top lineup model of the Apple Watch. Micro LED TVs are expected to remain a niche product for years to come.  DSCC, a market research firm, predicted on the 24th that micro LED display shipments would increase from 450,000 units in 2023 to 1.81 million units in 2024, 7.98 million units in 2025, 13.54 million units in 2026, and 17.47 million units in 2027. Sales over the same period are expected to grow to $44 million in 2023, $210 million in 2024, $713 million in 2025, $1.086 billion in 2026, and $1.395 billion in 2027.  The year in which microLED display shipments and sales projections jump significantly compared to the previous year is 2025. In 2025, shipments and sales are expected to increase by 4.4 times and 3.4 times, respectively, compared to the previous year.  In 2025, Apple is expected to apply microLED for the first time to the top lineup of the Apple Watch. Earlier this year, there were reports through foreign media that Apple could apply micro LED to the Apple Watch as early as 2024, but there were also observations that 2024 was too early in the domestic industry.  DSCC predicted today in Taiwan's display conference that LG Display is building a small-scale backplane line for the Micro LED Apple Watch, but that the line will only be operational in the second half of 2024. The expected release date of the Micro LED Apple Watch is also 2025.  MicroLED wearable products, including the Apple Watch, are expected to reach 7.9 million units in 2026 and 10.5 million units in 2027, starting with shipments of 4.2 million units in 2025. In micro LED display shipments, wearable products are expected to take the top spot from 2025.  Apple has released a 1.99-inch Organic Light-Emitting Diode (OLED) Apple Watch Ultra model for $799 as the top-of-the-line Apple Watch lineup in 2022. The battery life of this product is 60 hours. Apple is expected to change the display of the Apple Watch Ultra model from OLED to microLED. However, compared to the current price of OLED for the Apple Watch Ultra, which is less than $40, micro LED must secure economic feasibility.  The Elec lastly reports that MicroLED shipments for augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) are also expected to continue to increase. The forecast for shipments by year is 450,000 units in 2023, 1.79 million units in 2023, 3.72 million units in 2025, 5.53 million units in 2026, and 6.8 million units in 2027.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wYXRlbnRseWFwcGxlLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1L2luZHVzdHJ5LWV4cGVydC1jbGFpbXMtdGhhdC1taWNyb2xlZC1kaXNwbGF5LXNoaXBtZW50cy1hcmUtc2V0LXRvLWV4cGxvZGUtYnktMjAyNy13aXRoLWFwcGxlLXdhdGNoLXVsdHJhLWJlaW5nLW9uZS1vZi10aGUtZHIuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"explosion","2021-05-19","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-24T21:41:42","One day the familiar star Betelgeuse in Orion will explode as a supernova. When it does astronomers predict it will shine as bright as the full moon. To our eyes the supergiant star will look even brighter because all that light will be scrunched into a pinpoint. You'll be able to find your way at night by its light, and see your shadow, too.  The star Betelgeuse in Orion is true monster with a diameter more than 700 times that of the sun. If placed at the center of the solar system the star's surface would extend beyond the orbit of Jupiter. This image, made with the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope (VLT), is the most detailed to date. Contributed / ALMA, (ESO/NAOJ/NRAO), E. O’Gorman, P. Kervella  But why wait and hope for a single star to explode when supernovae are erupting everywhere all the time? In 2021 alone more than 2,200 were discovered and named. Not a single one hailed from our galaxy the Milky Way. The last ""local"" blast visible with the naked eye occurred around the year 1680 in Cassiopeia.  Good news. There are an estimated two trillion other galaxies out there. Both amateur and professional astronomers routinely monitor a host of them and turn up plenty of supernovae, all of which require a telescope to see except in rare cases. Most are really, really faint and look like tiny points of light embedded in the galaxy's disk or close by. They're all too far away to distinguish details of the actual explosion, but that doesn't diminish the wonder of knowing you're witnessing the sudden, catastrophic destruction of a star. Supernovae can shine with the light of 10 billion suns!  Yeah, they're a big deal. Especially so when a supernova appears in a nearby galaxy like M101, known as the Pinwheel for its whorl of spiral arms. When one erupts relatively close by there's a good chance it will become bright enough to spot in a modest telescope. I'm delighted to report that's exactly what's happening right now.  Every confirmed supernova gets an official designation. The one in M101 is named SN 2023ixf for the year of discovery. The first supernova discovered in 2023 was dubbed 2023A. The 26th was 2023Z. After a first run through the alphabet, letters are then doubled up — as in 2023aa, ab, ac — then tripled and quadrupled. Contributed / Gianluca Masi  Japanese amateur astronomer Koichi Itagaki discovered the object on May 19 at magnitude 14.9, which is near the limit of a 12-inch telescope. But it quickly grew brighter. Only 12 hours later I spotted it at 13.5 in my scope. As of Wednesday, May 24, it had climbed to magnitude 11, likely as bright as it will get. While not visible with the naked eye or binoculars a 6-inch telescope will show the cataclysm without difficulty when the moon doesn't interfere.  ADVERTISEMENT  To find the Pinwheel Galaxy and the supernova start at Mizar in the bend of the Dipper handle and follow the steppingstone stars (which I've connected into a path) to the galaxy. Through a telescope M101 will look like a softly-glowing, faint, fuzzy patch of light with a brighter center. Use a magnification of around 50-100x for the best views. After you've arrived used the detailed chart below to pinpoint the supernova's location. Contributed / Stellarium  M101 is an 8th magnitude galaxy located just off the handle of the Big Dipper which stands nearly overhead at nightfall in late May. Seen from a dark sky with minimal city glow the galaxy looks like a faint, fuzzy spot in standard 50mm binoculars.  To find it in your telescope, use a low power eyepiece (around 50x.) Locate Mizar in the bend of the handle and follow the ""breadcrumb trail"" of stars I've marked to the galaxy. Through the scope you should see a soft-glowing haze of light with a slightly brighter center. The supernova lies a short distance to the southeast of the center. Fortunately, there are no other obvious stars in the galaxy's disk to confuse it with.  This is an enlargement of the first map and shows the area around M101 in more detail. The ""guide star"" circled is about magnitude 8. The same star is labeled on the detailed map below to help you navigate to the galaxy and supernova. Contributed / Stellarium with additions by Bob King  The detailed chart below will not only help you pinpoint the supernova but you can use the numbered stars to monitor its changing brightness. The numbers are magnitudes with their decimal points omitted. For example, 91 means a star of magnitude 9.1. The greater the number the fainter the star. Right now 2023ixf is close to peak brightness, but it will gradually fade. Unlike typical explosions that are over in a flash supernovae blasts linger for weeks and months.  I added a rough sketch of the galaxy to this chart showing the supernova's location. The stars labeled with magnitudes will help you track its changing brightness in the nights and weeks ahead. Contributed / Courtesy of the AAVSO with additions by Bob King  The timing of the eruption couldn't have been better. M101 is high in the sky in May and June and so far north it never sets for observers at mid-northern latitudes. That means lots of time to follow the star's final act.  There are several varieties of supernovae, but astronomers have identified 2023ixf as the remains of a supergiant star like Betelgeuse. Gravity, single-minded as ever, wants to crush the star into a tiny ball. The only thing preventing that from happening is the heat and outward pressure pushing back from the core.  Massive stars create more complex elements from simpler ones through nuclear fusion in their cores. The process balances the attractive force of gravity, left. When the star runs out of fusible fuel it collapses and explodes as a supernova, right, releasing the freshly forged elements into space. Contributed / Left: NASA, right: ESO  Nuclear fusion in the core squeezes atoms of hydrogen together to create energy and a new element, helium. Every second the sun fuses about 600 tons of hydrogen to yield 596 tons of helium, with 4 tons converted into pure energy. Einstein was the first to point out that matter is really little more than a very concentrated form of energy.  Fusion keeps our favorite star in equilibrium with gravity and provides the abundant heat and sunshine that make Earth supremely habitable. Eventually the sun will run out of hydrogen in its core and instead fuse helium into carbon and oxygen to keep the lights on. But that's as far as it can go.  More massive stars have hotter cores able to fuse elements beyond helium to make neon, silicon and iron. But there's a problem. Once iron is made, fusion quickly comes to a halt. Iron is super stable and resists being fused into something else. With no push-back against gravity, the supergiant suddenly collapses.  ADVERTISEMENT  When all that material hits the core it creates shock waves that reverberate through the star and rip it to bits. Although we see little more than a point of light (because of the supernova's great distance), up close the catastrophic explosion must be utterly frightening, literally hell-fire unleashed. I try to remind myself of the tumult each time I return to the supernova, even as frogs sing from nearby ponds and peace settles over the dark land.

DOGE has made investors turn to this meme coin once again as the value of the meme coin is rising. And, with that, the excitement around other meme coins like Copium, Generation Wealth, and Milady.  There is no denying that 2023 is the year of recovering from the nightmare of 2022. There are so many promising crypto projects that recognize the power of community, and we will delve into that today. But first, let’s focus on what’s going on with DOGE.  >>> Buy $COPIUM Here<<<  DOGE struggles hit $0.1 while these new meme coins are on the rise  Even though Dogecoin’s (DOGE) price has been fluctuating a lot lately, its value has largely held steady. Apart from when Elon Musk bought Twitter, DOGE/USD traded adversely for the majority of 2022. In the Dogecoin community, the acquisition inspired optimism about rising cryptocurrency use.  It is currently the tenth-biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, and, following the Ethereum Merge, it has overtaken Bitcoin as the largest Proof-of-Work (PoS) cryptocurrency. Although Dogecoin is now trading at $0.073, it has faced stiff competition from other meme coins, and analysts believe it will soon reach $0.10. By the end of May, a DOGE breakthrough will probably require a significant catalyst, according to the experts.  To give you a clear idea, here’s a breakdown of Dogecoin’s possible price prediction from 2023 to 2026.  YEAR MINIMUM PRICE AVERAGE PRICE MAXIMUM PRICE 2023 $0.15 $0.16 $0.17 2024 $0.21 $0.22 $0.26 2025 $0.30 $0.31 $0.37 2026 $0.45 $0.47 $0.52  While DOGE requires further adoption to pass the $0.1 threshold, the other hot coins we’ll look at are gaining popularity because of their inherent value.  Let’s get to looking at them one by one.  >>> Buy $COPIUM Here<<<  $COPIUM  When it’s about the newest meme coin in trend, the first that comes to mind is $COPIUM, which has been termed “more than just a coin” by the community. The primary purpose of the coin is to transform your negative experience in the crypto market into a positive one by showing that humor can reward you. You can change your past losses into gains in the present through $COPIUM, according to the creators.  Investors are driven to $COPIUM for a variety of reasons, including the feeling of camaraderie and support among peers. It gives those who have suffered because of market shifts or bad judgments a second chance. Moreover, $COPIUM offers an attractive NFT airdrop to its top holders. The goal of this multi-stage incentive program is to recognize and honor the top cops. Holders may visually follow the success of their investments thanks to the token tank.  $COPIUM merges humor with the potential to gain profits in a fun yet lucrative way. With the exclusive airdrop offering, $COPIUM holders can get rewards. This is why it is a smart idea to join the $COPIUM presale when it is still in its early stages. Moreover, if you have somehow missed the chance to take advantage of coins like PEPE or SHIB exploding before, this is your chance to get the most out of your investment through $COPIUM.  >>> Buy $COPIUM Here<<<  $LADYS  A cryptocurrency that is gaining popularity in the cryptocurrency market is Milady Meme Coin, better known as $LADYS. $LADYS is a cryptocurrency that was initially made as a joke or meme, similar to other meme coins, but has now attracted a sizable following and investment.  This meme coin that has been the talk of the town lately is Milady, which has reached almost the same level of popularity as the PEPE coin. In just a few days, this new meme coin has achieved a 100x increase in popularity and is projected to grow exponentially in the coming days.  What started with Elon Musk’s tweet, has now unveiled a fresh ERC-20 coin known as the Milady meme currency. For the past few days, “LADYS” has been trending on Twitter. Like many other new currencies introduced in the 2023 meme coin season, LADYS is anonymous. The people who made the meme currency don’t work in a formal team.  The Milady meme currency page states that the token was created for the Milady community. Furthermore, just a fraction of the initial LADYS airdrop is available to Milady NFT holders.

Four rounds of matches are remaining to the end of the league season and any slip up by any of the two at this stage will most certainly end any lingering title hopes.  Tusker have 64 points and a goal difference of plus 19 compared to plus 27 for Gor Mahia.  The eagerly anticipated high-stakes game was initially scheduled for Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani but Tusker, as the host team, changed the venue to Nyayo National Stadium.  It will not escape discerning football followers in the country that Gor has not had a good record playing at Nyayo this season. In five outings, they have won twice, drawn five times and won once.  Two weeks ago, despite dominating proceeding their lost 2-1 to bitter rivals AFC Leopards at the very same venue. This ended K’Ogalo’s seven-year unbeaten run in the famous “Mashemeji” derby.  League actions returns Friday after last weekend’s break for the Mozzart Bet Cup semi-finals. According to Gor Mahia number one fan Jared Otieno aka Jaro Soja, the club will use all their available online platforms and radio stations to mobilise fans to attend the game in numbers and give their beloved team the benefit of a 12th man.  “We are not taking chances and as a leading fan, I’m calling on all of our fans not to sit back because winning this match will clear our path to winning the league.  “We have to be there in our numbers and support our players,” declared the Green Army diehard.  He also rallied on AFC Leopards fans to lick their wounds after losing the Cup semi-finals against Kakamega Homeboyz and support K’Ogalo to beat Tusker which he termed as a common enemy to the two teams.  Leopards coach Patrick Aussems has clashed with his Tusker counterpart Robert Matano.  Aussems has clearly shown their is no love lost between them by publicly declaring he would rather see Gor Mahia win the league than Matano’s Tusker.  Gor fans could have set the scene for a torrid time for Tusker.  The Green Army adherents fans frustrated Matano during the Mashemeji Derby, denying him entry through the main gate. The veteran Tusker coach had to use the VVIP gate at gain entry and watch the match.  “Even taking the game to Nyayo will not help Tusker. Leopards fans should join us because our common enemy is Tusker and we appreciated Ingwe when they beat us in the Mashemeji Derby. A win for us is as good as revenge for Leopards,” added Soja.  The famous fan also added that they are marshalling fans from various branches outside Nairobi to attend the game.  In the first leg clash which Gor Mahia won 2-1 at Kasarani in February, Matano reacted furiously to the centre referee’s decision of awarding a penalty to K’Ogalo for their winning goal late in the match via the boot of Benson Omala.  Midfielder Sydney Wahongo had given Gor Mahia the lead in the first half that was cancelled out by Tusker midfielder Shami Kibwana.  Gor, last year’s Mozzart Cup champions, were knocked-out in the tournament’s round of 16 by finalist Kakamega Homeboyz. Gor’s only chance of playing continental football is winning the league title.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uLmFmcmljYS9rZW55YS9zcG9ydHMvZm9vdGJhbGwvbG9vbWluZy10dXNrZXItZ29yLWNsYXNoLXByb21pc2VzLXRvLWJlLWV4cGxvc2l2ZS0tNDI0NTU3MtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The company also said it expects Q2 revenue to come in at about $11 billion, plus or minus 2%. Wall Street was expecting $7.2 billion.  Nvidia is at the center of the AI explosion thanks to its high-powered graphics cards and server products, and its stock price is soaring. Over the last year, shares of Nvidia have jumped 77%, while rival AMD (AMD) has jumped 12%. Intel (INTC) shares are down 30% in the same timeframe.  Here are the most important numbers from the report compared to what was expected, as compiled by Bloomberg.  Revenue: $7.2 billion versus $6.5 billion expected  Adj. EPS: $1.09 versus $0.92 expected  Gaming: $2.2 billion versus $1.9 billion expected  Data center: $4.2 billion versus $3.9 billion expected  Shares of Nvidia were up more than 13% following the announcement.  “The computer industry is going through two simultaneous transitions — accelerated computing and generative AI,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement.  “A trillion dollars of installed global data center infrastructure will transition from general purpose to accelerated computing as companies race to apply generative AI into every product, service and business process.""  While shares of Nvidia are riding the AI wave, thanks to the introduction of OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Microsoft (MSFT) and Google’s (GOOG, GOOGL) own generative AI efforts, the company is still contending with a vicious slowdown in the gaming industry.  Much of that has to do with the broader downturn in consumer spending on electronics following the explosive growth the industry experienced during the pandemic. With nothing to do but sit at home, consumers bought up graphics cards and similarly equipped PCs to pass the time.  Now that gamers have those systems in their hands, however, there’s little reason to upgrade anytime soon. Intel and AMD are experiencing the same kind of problems with their own client computing groups.  Nvidia reporter better than expected results after the bell Wednesday. REUTERS/Mike Blake  But the slowdown should be coming to an end soon. Wall Street expects Nvidia to post revenue growth in its gaming business for the first time in a year in Q2, according to Bloomberg data. That would go a long way to helping Nvidia’s overall revenue growth after a third consecutive quarter-over-quarter decline as of Q1.  Sign up for the Yahoo Finance newsletter.

"explosion","2023-10-10","14:00:00","{""Texarkana"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-25T03:10:05","TEXARKANA, Ark. -- Arkansas High showed to be in a good bill of health Wednesday afternoon as they held its red and white spring football game at Razorback Stadium in front of the sparse, but excited, crowd while beginning preparations for the upcoming 2023 varsity football season.  Second-year head coach Trey Outlaw was hired by TASD this time a year ago, making the scrimmage a first for he as well with the Razorbacks.  Losing just three seniors from the 2022 squad, Coach Outlaw now has 22 seniors on this year's roster that look to help guide the Razorbacks to a promising fall campaign. The Razorbacks have big plans to build on their 4-6 record from last season that saw them come up one win short of qualifying for the postseason.  ""We are going to go as far as our seniors take us,"" Outlaw said. ""I've never been a part of a great program that didn't have great senior leaders. We have some seniors on this team who are big-time contributors, and we expect for them to step up and be great leaders for us going into next season.""  Among the upperclassmen expected to lead the way is quarterback Nate Wall, also in his second year as the signal caller for the Porkers. From the very first snap of the game Wednesday, Wall gave the Razorback faithful plenty to cheer about with his first pass to fellow senior, and newcomer, Telly Wells deep down the left side for an 70-yard touchdown strike to get the offense flowing early. Wall and Wells would hook up twice more in the first half on scoring strikes from both 10 and 20 yards out during the seventh and tenth series.  Wells will be an added bonus to an already senior-laden wide receiver core with Marcus Floyd, Quevy Ross, Javen Davis, and Makel Watson. Wells was also recently named as an all-state track and field selection for class 5A, while Ross and Watson also starred on the varsity basketball team during the winter. Davis was the recipient of Wall's two final touchdown tosses in the second half, as he hauled in impressive grabs of 30 and 50 yards each on the first and fourth series.  Other seniors with big shoes to fill that also have high praise from Outlaw are defensive lineman Kence Griffin, cornerback Cam Sanders, and center Brandon Nguyen. Nguyen returns to his duties from last season starting all ten contests, while Griffin is a transfer student and in his first season with the Razorbacks.  ""We are lightyears better at this point then we were at this time last year,"" Outlaw said. ""The last thing I told our guys is we haven't done anything yet. Until we strap up against another opponent we can't be satisfied. When we go into the first week of the season against Wastson Chapel thinking we've already done something, we're going to be in for rude awakenings.""  A few juniors on both sides of the ball have also garnered the attention of the coaching staff as the offense ran 13 series in the opening half, scoring a total of eight times. Only six series were run in the second half. The defense forced six punts from Joshua Sharpe, an interception from Tucker Seal, and one sack from defensive lineman Miquan Traylor. Taylor would tally another sack in the second half, along with a third that came from linebacker Christian Roberts. Sharpe averaged almost 40 yards per punt for his attempts.  Heading up the Razorbacks' backfield as the returning starter, and the likely bell cow, will be Courtland Loudermill. Sparing Loudermill will be Richard Tyous and Ronderrick Burris, as well as sophomore Zephaniah Black at times. Loudermill got his lone score of the game on a 35 yard scamper around the left end on the fourth series, while Tyous later rushed for an 18 yard score on the twelfth series and then nabbed a 10 yard touchdown reception on the final series of the first half.  ""There were a lot of bright spots."" Outlaw said. ""When you start off with offense on the very first play of the game with Nate Walls to Telly Wells, we'll look for that to happen a lot. Courtland Loudermill had a couple of long runs. Defensively, we had a couple of sacks and interceptions, so truly we saw a lot of good stuff today.""  The kicking game for the Razorbacks was perfect, as Hayden Moya executed all six of his extra point attempts and a field goal of 37 yards. Fellow kicker Diego Servantes connected on his only field goal attempt from 34 yards, along with one extra point, respectively.  ""We have to make sure they're hungry, show up, give great effort and do their best,"" Outlaw said. ""That's the only way to win.""  The Razorbacks will begin summer practices next Tuesday as they look ahead for their week one slate home opener against Watson Chapel.

Ron DeSantis announcing his run for president, struggled with technical glitches and a near half-hour delay Tuesday  Elon Musk wants to turn into a “digital town square,” but his much-publicized Twitter Spaces kickoff event, with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announcing his run for president, struggled with technical glitches and a near half-hour delay Tuesday.  The billionaire Twitter owner said the problems were due to “straining” servers because so many people were trying to listen to the audio-only event. But even at their highest, the number of listeners listed topped out at around 420,000, far from the millions of viewers that televised presidential announcements attract.  “There’s so many people,” said host David Sacks amid the disruptions. “We’ve got so many people here that we are kind of melting the servers, which is a good sign.”  After it concluded without further disruptions, Musk, DeSantis and Sacks played off the event as a success, with Sacks quipping “it's not how you start, it's how you finish — and we finished really strong.""  Musk a day earlier dubbed the event a historic first for Twitter, saying it would be “the first time something like this is happening on social media.” The webcast was scheduled to start at 6 p.m. ET but nearly 30 minutes passed with users getting kicked off, hearing microphone feedback and enduring other technical problems before it finally began. The audience remained under 500,000.  DeSantis opponents had a field day with the delayed announcement.  ""Glitchy. Tech issues. Uncomfortable silences. A complete failure to launch. And that’s just the candidate!” said Steven Cheung, a spokesperson for former President and current candidate Donald Trump.  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat from New York, tweeted, “We had more people join when I played Among Us,” referencing the popular video game.  Twitter has suffered a host of technical issues since Musk took over and fired or laid off roughly 80% of its staff — including engineers tasked with keeping the site running. A day before the DeSantis event, speaking at The Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council Summit in London, Musk expressed confidence about Twitter's future and said he is “going to start adding people to the company” but gave no further details.  Musk bought Twitter last fall for $44 billion. Since then, he has upended the platform's verification system, loosened its content moderation policies in line with his views as a “free speech absolutist,” spread misinformation and engaged with far-right figures, all the while working to attract jittery advertisers back to the platform to turn it profitable. His grand vision, he has said repeatedly, is to eventually turn Twitter into an “ everything app ” for everyone — a digital town square where people can hear from world leaders and politicians without the need for traditional media as a go-between.  But he seems to mainly be courting conservatives and Republicans lately, referring to Democrats and liberals as infected by the “woke mind virus” and reinstating extremist accounts that were banned by Twitter's previous administration.  Wednesday's campaign launch event with DeSantis continued the trend — though it remains to be seen whether the platform can become a go-to destination for mainstream politicians when it continues to show evidence of instability. For instance, the word “DeSaster” was trending on Twitter Wednesday evening as users mocked the botched campaign launch.  In the world of traditional media and politics, a glitchy half-hour delay and an audience in the hundreds of thousands rather than millions, Wednesday's Twitter Spaces event might look like a failure. But in Silicon Valley, failure is often spun as positive, even essential in developing new products and improving existing ones. Twitter Spaces — which Twitter launched in 2020 to compete with the then-popular audio chat site Clubhouse — is generally not used for audiences in the hundreds of thousands, so in some ways it was not a surprise that the event was marred with technical problems.  “It's much worse for DeSantis than it is for Musk,” said Jo-Ellen Pozner, a business professor at Santa Clara University, noting that just a month ago Musk's SpaceX launched a rocket that exploded minutes after its launch from Texas. After the explosion, Musk called it “an exciting test launch of Starship! Learned a lot for next test launch in a few months"" in a tweet.  “It is clearly a difficult situation for DeSantis, who wants to project competence, who wants to forestall criticism,” she said. “Musk has an easier out by just saying that ‘this was the first time we tried it, it didn’t work out perfectly, but next time we’ll do much better,’ in the classic Silicon Valley approach to failing fast and learning more.”  Pozner said it remains an “open question” how Twitter is going to be valued as a broad digital platform down the line.  “I think will depend on, you know, how he and the top management react to this and how they spin it,” she said.  After DeSantis logged off, Musk and Sacks extended an open invitation to any other presidential candidate who wants to do a Twitter Spaces event. Whether or not they get any takers could signal what the future holds for Twitter as a “public square.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vVGVjaG5vbG9neS93aXJlU3RvcnkvZWxvbi1tdXNrcy1oaXN0b3JpYy10d2l0dGVyLWV2ZW50LXJvbi1kZXNhbnRpcy1zdHJ1Z2dsZXMtOTk1ODYyMzLSAXFodHRwczovL2FiY25ld3MuZ28uY29tL2FtcC9UZWNobm9sb2d5L3dpcmVTdG9yeS9lbG9uLW11c2tzLWhpc3RvcmljLXR3aXR0ZXItZXZlbnQtcm9uLWRlc2FudGlzLXN0cnVnZ2xlcy05OTU4NjIzMg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Police had been called to an area of Cubbington Wood, near Leamington Spa, and then handed it over to the British Army's Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) specialists. Speaking to Forces News, HS2 confirmed that the military team identified the munition as a German SC 250 Air-dropped General Purpose High Explosive Bomb and safely carried out the detonation.  The contractor added that it is thought this is the largest bomb ever found on an HS2 site to date, at around a metre long and 368mm in diameter. Residents and a nearby school had to be notified, and the site was then secured to carry out the operation.  Watch: Controlled Detonation Of WW2 Bomb In Exeter.

"explosion","2017-02-11","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-24T13:42:03","One repeated theme of the memoir Truth to Power: My Three Years Inside Eskom, by Andre de Ruyter, former CEO of South Africa’s troubled power utility, Eskom, is that “negligence and carelessness had become cemented into the organisation”.  Dirt piled up at even the newest power stations until it damaged equipment, which stopped working – and some equipment disappeared beneath a layer of ash.  Integrity had been displaced by greed and crime:  Corruption had metastasised to permeate much of the organisation.  As a political scientist who has, among other topics, followed corruption and kleptocracy, this book ranks among the more informative.  De Ruyter (or his ghost writer) delivers a pacey, racy adventure thriller. Chapter after chapter reads like a horror story about Eskom, whose failure to generate enough electricity consistently for the past 15 years has hobbled the economy.  The book is also a sobering indication that parts of South Africa now fester with organised crime.  This book merits its place alongside How to Steal a City and How to Steal a Country. These two books chronicle how corruption undermined respectively a city and a country to the level where they became dysfunctional.  Brazen looting  Another take-away is the devastating indictment of De Ruyter’s immediate predecessors as CEO, Matshela Koko and Brian Molefe. They appear as incompetent managers who ran into the ground what the Financial Times of London had praised as the world’s best state-owned enterprise as recently as 2001. Both Koko and Molefe have been charged with corruption – at Eskom and the transport parastatal Transet, respectively.  Read more: Explosive revelations about South Africa's power utility: why new electricity minister should heed the words of former Eskom CEO  The standard joke about corruption is “Mr Ten Percent” – meaning a middleman who adds 10% onto the price of everything passing through his hands. Under Koko and Molefe, this had allegedly ballooned into “Mr Ten Thousand Percent”.  For example, De Ruyter writes that Eskom was just stopped in the nick of time from paying a middleman R238,000 for a cleaning mop.  Corruption focused on the procurement chain. One middleman bought knee-pads for R150 (US$7,80) and sold them to Eskom for R80,000 (US$4,200). Another bought a knee-pad for R4,025 (US$209) and sold it to Eskom for R934,950 (US$48,544). The same applied to toilet rolls and rubbish bags. One inevitable consequence of corruption on such a scale was that Eskom’s debt, which was R40 billion (US$2.076 billion) in 2007 (the year that former president Jacob Zuma came to power), ballooned to R483 billion (US$25 billion) by 2020 – which incurred R31 billion (US$160 million) in annual finance charges.  PenguinRandomHouse  De Ruyter reveals that the “presidential” cartel (meaning one of the local mafias) pillaged Matla power station, the “Mesh-Kings” cartel Duvha power station, the “Legendaries” cartel Tutuka power station, and the “Chief” cartel Majuba power station. He writes that the going rate for bribes at Kusile power station is R200,000 (US$10,377) to falsify the delivery of one truckload of good quality coal. Kusile is one of the two giant new coal-fired power stations which Eskom is relying on to end power cuts.  Read more: South Africa's bailout of Eskom won't end power cuts: splitting up the utility can, as other countries have shown  The book says a senior officer at the Hawks, the police’s priority crimes investigation units, tipped off De Ruyter how he was blocked in all his attempts to combat corruption at Eskom. Senior police officers, at least one prosecutor, and a senior magistrate, have also been bribed by the gangs.  Noncomformist  Eskom had 13 CEOs and acting CEOs in 13 years. Twenty-eight candidates, most of them black, rejected head-hunters’ offers to become CEO of Eskom. De Ruyter who was previously CEO of Nampak, took a pay cut (to R7 million) to accept the job, in the hope of accelerating Eskom’s transition from coal to renewables.  At the time of his appointment some commentators alleged that he was an African National Congress (ANC) cadre deployed to Eskom. The ANC’s cadre deployment policy is aimed at ensuring that all the levers of power are in loyal party hands – often regardless of ability and probity. But De Ruyter came into conflict with the ruling party.  What caught De Ruyter out was the viciousness of the political attacks on him: smears of racism and financial impropriety. He had to devote many hours of office time to refuting them:  occupying that seat at Megawatt Park comes with political baggage.  Megawatt Park is Eskom’s head office in Johannesburg.  The book’s early chapters summarise how he was one of those Afrikaners with Dutch parents, who did not conform entirely to apartheid norms. The Afrikaner volk imposed the apartheid regime onto South Africa for 42 years. In his high school years he became a card-carrying member of the Progressive Federal Party, a liberal anti-apartheid opposition party, antecedent of the Democratic Alliance, which is now the official opposition to the governing party.  Poisoning  De Ruyter’s book mentions organising a routine Eskom stakeholders’ meeting at a guesthouse in Mpumalanga province.  To save time, he ordered that food be served on plates to table places, instead of buffet arrangements. The guesthouse management refused, due to fear of facilitating poisoning one or more guests – only buffet arrangements could thwart that.  He says that in Tshwane (Pretoria), the seat of government, the National Prosecution Authority no longer orders takeaway lunches for delivery to their premises. Instead, standard procedure is that a staff member buys lunches for all at random take-away shops.  This sinister development culminated in De Ruyter himself being poisoned with cyanide in his coffee in his office, demonstrating how mafia-type gangs had recruited at least one Eskom headquarters staff member.  Unintended consequences  In several places De Ruyter also touches on other issues. The unintended consequence of some government policies, such as localisation and preferential procurement, is that it costs Eskom two and a half times more to pay for each kilometre of transmission cable than it costs Nampower Namibia’s power utility, just across the border.  What stands out from this memoir is that the success of a company demands that a CEO, managers, artisans, guards, and cleaners all take the attitude that the buck stops with them – seven days a week – and act accordingly.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3RoZWNvbnZlcnNhdGlvbi5jb20vY29ycnVwdGlvbi1pbi1zb3V0aC1hZnJpY2EtZm9ybWVyLWNlb3MtZXhwbG9zaXZlLWJvb2stZXhwb3Nlcy1ob3ctc3RhdGUtcG93ZXItdXRpbGl0eS13YXMtZGVzdHJveWVkLTIwNjEwMdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

There were no injuries, but Caradoc Sands said everything inside was destroyed. Damage is estimated to cost $1-million.  The Strathroy-Caradoc fire department was called out to the golf course at 1pm on May 16th.  Scroll to continue with content Ad ADVERTISEMENT  The first firefighter officer to get there confirmed that there was a lot of things to be cautious about that were going to explode. Inside the building were fertilizers and other chemicals used for course maintenance, propane, oxy acetylene tanks, and a bunch of grass mowers, tractors and fuel.  With things blowing up, the first arriving fire officer decided to go on the defensive after it was confirmed that no people were in the building or immediate area.  An aerial unit and ground monitor equipment were set up. Firefighters from all three Strathroy-Caradoc stations responded. Firefighters from Adelaide Metcalfe brought two tankers from Kerwood. It took 25 firefighters to extinguish the blaze.  Strathroy-Caradoc Police informed neighbours in the travel path of the smoke to close all windows, turn off heating and air conditioners, and shelter in place until conditions were brought under control.  After surveillance from the air and ground, the four station crews moved in closer to more thoroughly examine the situation and extinguish the flames. Strathroy-Caradoc’s press release said loss stop was declared and a cursory origin and cause examination was started around 5pm.  Fire investigators were able to leave the scene at about 7:30pm.  The Office of the Fire Marshall was contacted but is not attending the scene for the investigation.

Ryan Cory, a 2024 three-star offensive lineman, is scheduled to visit the Badgers first before making his other official visits. Cory is also scheduled to visit Pittsburgh and then Vanderbilt following his trip to Madison, which makes his visit a pivotal recruiting opportunity for the Badgers staff. Currently, Pittsburgh has been in the lead for the recruit due to the playing time they can offer, but Wisconsin appears to still be in the mix.  Wisconsin Badgers Football Hosting 2024 Three-Star Offensive Lineman Ryan Cory  The Wisconsin Badgers have been trying to land another offensive lineman for quite some time now. Most recently Marcus Harrison, who was expected to visit campus next month, committed to the Georgia Bulldogs shortly after finishing his official visit. Harrison was a big target for the Badgers, and his commitment came as a shock for the team. However, recruiting never stops and the Badgers have already shifted their focus on other recruits.  One such recruit is Ryan Cory, a 6-foot-4-inch, 290-pound offensive lineman from Pennsylvania. Cory is currently ranked as a three-star recruit and holds the 23rd spot in the state rankings. The lineman is also ranked as the 48th overall interior lineman in the 2024 football recruiting class. Cory holds 23 offers, including one from the Badgers and another from the Cincinnati Bearcats. Cory has been recruited by Luke Fickell in the past and now his main contact has been Jack Bicknell Jr.  The talented offensive lineman has been a player of interest for Fickell, who originally offered the recruit 14 months ago. Since then, Cory has received a handful of offers and also made quite a few visits. The lineman has visited Pittsburgh and Penn State three times each during his recruitment. Cory has also made a visit to Miami (FL) and one to Madison earlier this month. Pittsburgh and Penn State have recruited the prospect aggressively so far, but Cory seems to have a better relationship with the Wisconsin staff due to his official visit schedule.  Wisconsin Badgers Football Recruiting Profile: Ryan Cory  Cory is an explosive interior lineman with the power and speed to protect in the run especially. The lineman uses his size to move defensive linemen out of the way. Linebackers and defensive backers have little to no chance against Cory due to his stellar footwork and reaction time. The exceptional recruit has the speed and power to dominate at the collegiate level, especially in an aggressive offense like the new-look Wisconsin offense.  The interior lineman also has great field vision that allows him to find the man that needs to be blocked with ease. Cory pulls very well and bowls over defenders once he gets a head of steam. Opposing defenses have trouble trying to apply pressure up the middle against Cory and his support in the run game is immense. Wisconsin should begin to recruit Cory heavily due to his interest in the school and his potential scheme fit. With the right work, Cory could develop into a high-level collegiate lineman due to his natural abilities.

"explosion","2019-07-14","Not Discerned","{""LosAngeles"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-25T04:00:00","It has been two decades since the first of what has become the “Fast and Furious” franchise roared onto the global pop culture scene. Now, in its thrilling 10th installment, aptly titled “Fast X,” this lucrative franchise brings back familiar faces, villains, and friends to ignite another adrenaline-fueled adventure.  If you’ve somehow forgotten, these movies revolve around international espionage and intricate multimillion-dollar heists, delivering a straightforward yet exhilarating formula since 2001, firmly establishing itself within the crime thriller genre.  At its core, “Fast X” revolves around the origin story of an undercover cop, Brian O’Conner (played by the late Paul Walker), whose mission involved infiltrating a Los Angeles street-racing ring. His main obstacle? Dominic Toretto (portrayed by the charismatic Vin Diesel), the man he sought to bring down. Their intense rivalry manifested on the road, transforming former allies into sworn enemies. With their passion and expertise now divided by the law, they engaged in a saga of rage, deceit, and meticulous planning. However, their eventual reconciliation, marked by a spectacular display of mutual respect, opened the door to endless possibilities within this beloved franchise.  As the series progressed, Brian and Dom formed an unexpected alliance, stealing supercars and assisting the authorities in a multitude of plot twists. By this point, if you’re a fan of the franchise, you’re undoubtedly devoted. “Fast X” may not boast the strongest storyline, but let me stress this: For fans, it hardly matters.  RELATED: Jennifer Lopez shines in Netflix’s “The Mother”  This installment serves as a grand reunion, uniting all the A-list characters who have breathed life into the previous nine movies. The villain, Dante (played by the formidable Jason Momoa), is a diabolical new character, the vengeful son of a Brazilian crime lord, Hernan Reyes. His sole obsession is to make Dominic Toretto and his “family” suffer.  When the imminent declaration of a war shakes their world, sides are chosen, and loved ones face the harsh reality that not everyone will make it through unscathed. Enter Cipher (brought to life by the talented Charlize Theron), a brilliant hacker and unequivocal villain. When it comes to picking sides, one tends to choose the “devil they know best.”  Director Justin Lin, known for helming five films in the franchise, takes a step back for this installment, allowing French director Louis Leterrier (“Clash of the Titans”) to take the reins. Leterrier’s strength lies in delivering captivating action sequences while the storyline may falter. As expected, this fuel-injected action film propels its characters in and out of speeding cars, with thrilling fights and a plethora of colorful language sprinkled in between.  Nevertheless, the story in “Fast X” can be challenging to follow. We are left wondering why Dom and his extended family find themselves entangled in this “war.” However, the film compensates with a long and exhilarating opening sequence that almost feels like a climactic moment: Dante is launched off a bridge in Rio, and from that point on, he devotes the next decade to studying Dom’s life and every move.  “Fast X” delivers the anticipated eye candy, treating the audience to extended montages of beautiful women clad in booty shorts, engaging in lively twerking before each street race. Joining the franchise are two new female characters: Isabel (played by Daniela Melchior) and Tess (portrayed by Brie Larson), both intricately linked to Dom’s friends from previous films, effectively making them part of the family.  Dom has a penchant for expanding his family circle, regardless of the vulnerability it entails. It’s almost as if he thrives in the midst of chaos. For instance, he unleashes a colossal rolling neutron bomb in Rome, nearly obliterating the Vatican. Explosive scenes abound in Brazil, Portugal, Los Angeles, and even Antarctica. In Dom’s mind, he will stop at nothing to protect his 8-year-old son (played by Leo Abelo Perry), even if it means losing many of his old friends along the way.  “Fast X” is designed for those who crave fast cars and explosive action, and care less about intricate storytelling. It operates like a well-oiled (pun intended) money-making machine, catering to the desires of its devoted fan base.  Directed by Leterrier and featuring a screenplay by Justin Lin and Dan Mazeau, based on the characters created by Gary Scott Thompson, “Fast X” showcases the visual prowess of cinematographer Stephen F. Windon. The editing skills of Dylan Highsmith and Kelly Matsumoto, along with the exhilarating musical score composed by Brian Tyler, heighten the excitement of the film.

Building on that momentum, the team continued their offensive onslaught at the start of their six-game road trip.  The fireworks began early for the Crabs, as Isaias Quiroz, who recently joined the team, launched a three-run homer in the second inning. The following inning saw the Blue Crabs add five more runs to their tally, with Alex Crosby contributing two runs with a single, Jose Rosario adding another with a double, and Quiroz capping off the inning with yet another home run. This offensive outburst forced the opposing team’s starting pitcher, Jorge Martinez, out of the game and caused havoc for their designated hitter.  Although the York Revolution managed to score two runs in the bottom of the fourth, the Blue Crabs’ pitching staff held them at bay for the remainder of the game. Braxton Lee added to the lead with his third home run of the year, while Michael Wielansky contributed with his team-leading seventh home run. The dominant performance propelled the Blue Crabs to a commanding 14-2 lead, securing their third consecutive win.  The Southern Maryland offense has been firing on all cylinders, amassing an impressive 29 runs and 32 hits in the past two games. Notably, every member of the starting lineup has reached base during this impressive offensive surge. On the defensive side, Daryl Thompson delivered an exceptional pitching performance, going seven innings and only allowing four hits and two earned runs. Thompson’s stellar outing also included zero walks and five strikeouts, further solidifying his reputation as a formidable force in the Atlantic League. The victory marked Thompson’s 94th win in his career in the league.  Looking ahead, the Blue Crabs aim to continue their winning streak and clinch another series victory. Left-hander Sandro Cabrera is set to start on the mound, facing off against JT Hintzen. The game is scheduled to begin at 6:35, and fans can catch the action live on FloSports.  Consistency is a crucial element in baseball, and the Blue Crabs have found their groove with a remarkable offensive display in their recent games. With their bats ablaze and pitchers in top form, the team is determined to maintain their winning ways as they push for further success in the Atlantic League.

"explosion","2023-05-17","Not Discerned","{""Lockhart"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-24T14:49:00","Lions explode out of gate at Spring Game Share:        By Kyle Mooty  LPR Editor  What does a player coming off a record-setting season running the ball do on his first play of the Spring Football Game?  Ashton Dickens tossed a 70-yard touchdown pass, and over-the-shoulder catch by Ethan Aguirre, who ran the final 45 yards to the end zone. It was quite a way to start for Dickens, a player with loads of accolades as he’ll be entering his senior season, and for Aguirre, a sophomore-to-be for Coach Todd Moebes Lockhart Lions.  LHS capped off a 16-practice spring with Thursday evening’s Maroon and White Game at Lions Stadium, which saw player introduction as well as cheerleaders, Lionettes and the Roaring Lion Band perform.  “The spring game is kind of an event,” Moebes said. “The 16 practices leading up to that is what I like to gauge everything on. We certainly practiced with a better tempo and we’re more physical. We like to create depth, and I think we did that.”  Dickens did not have a rushing attempt in the spring game.  “We certainly know what he is capable of doing,” Moebes said.  The Lions are coming off an 8-4 season where they reached the second round of the state playoffs, losing a 49-42 shootout to Corpus Christi’s Flour Bluff at San Antonio.  “We have a good group with our senior class, and we feel that our underclassmen are capable too,” said Moebes, who dressed out 68 players for the game.  Several players, including Dickens, played for each squad.  The defense took over after the first play, not allowing another score until late in the first half. Dickens did have another nice completion to junior-to-be wide receiver Gabe Deutsch.  Senior-to-be Quavon Reese had an interception in the first quarter.  Noel Jaimes, who will be a sophomore this fall, got plenty of reps at quarterback.  Another sophomore-to-be, running back Devin Marciellus, had some of the better runs in the first half.  The Lions will be replacing standout running back Sean McKinney, who has finished his career.

Tiffany Crutcher, an Alabama mom, rescued her teen son, Dzhyan, with her bare hands after he became engulfed in a blaze during a viral social media challenge that involved people dousing an open flame with alcohol.  “He went into the bathroom and he took a candle and poured alcohol onto it. It exploded onto him, catching him on fire. I was there immediately. I heard the explosion,” the mother shared with Kennedy News & Media.  Unfortunately, the shocking stunt didn’t turn out well for the 13-year-old, who suffered injuries on 45% of his body from the waist up, with third- and second-degree burns on his stomach, chest, face and neck.  Tiffany, 34, recalled her son running out of the bathroom, panicking.  “I tried to put him out with my hands at first,” she said. “We were taught to stop, drop and roll, so I tried that — and it didn’t work.”  Eventually, her youngest child, Zaelyn, 12, handed her a fire extinguisher, which she used to put out the flames.  “He was completely on fire from the waist up,” Tiffany revealed. “It was terrifying.”  Dzyhan participated in a social media challenge that left him traumatized and severely injured. Kennedy News & Media  Tiffany Crutcher, an Alabama mom, rescued her teen son, Dzhyan, with her bare hands after he became engulfed in a blaze. Kennedy News & Media  Afterward, Tiffany barely recognized her son.  “His face looked really bad to me — his face was so swollen,” she recalled to Kennedy News. “It was awful. I was in shock.”  “His arms were the worst. They were burned third-degree, full thickness all the way around and down both arms,” she continued.  Doctors had to cut incisions along the child’s arms to allow circulation from the swelling.  The mother of three remembered setting candles around the house because a storm was approaching the area that could knock out their power.  However, that’s when her son took it as an opportunity to pursue the life-threatening stunt.  After Dzhyan snagged a lit candle, he found alcohol in a bathroom cabinet and sparked the flames.  The 13-year-old took a candle into the bathroom and poured alcohol on it, which led to an explosion. Kennedy News & Media  Dzhyan, 13, must go to therapy to learn how to use his hands and arms again. Kennedy News & Media  His mother, Tiffany, mentioned how her son beats himself up about the incident. Kennedy News & Media  “He said that he was just experimenting; he didn’t know that it would explode,” Tiffany said. “He’s into science — he didn’t know it would do that. He just wanted to see what it would do.”  Investigators confirmed Dzhyan’s participation in the dangerous social media challenge.  “When the trend of kids holding their breath was going viral, I warned them not to do anything that would hurt them,” Tiffany said. “I was surprised that he tried it.  “I tell them they can’t try everything. Some stuff is dangerous and you have to be aware,” his mother added.  Tiffany’s son spent one month in the hospital and has received four skin grafts.  With two more years before complete recovery, Dzhyan must go to a burn clinic and therapy for treatment, and he is learning how to use his hands and arms again.  Doctors said he is healing well but has two more years of treatment before he will be fully healed. Kennedy News & Media  The teen suffered second- and third-degree burns. Kennedy News & Media  His mother tried to douse the fire with her hands — using the stop, drop and roll method — but nothing worked until she utilized an extinguisher. Kennedy News & Media  “The pain from it and going through the therapy upsets him because he knows he has a long road to recovery,” Tiffany said.  She also admitted that she isn’t hard on her 13-year-old after the incident, as “kids make mistakes and he is beating himself up about it.”  “He is traumatized — he gets in moods and says he doesn’t know why he did it,” she said.  The mom, who lives in Athens, Alabama, encouraged other parents to open up to their kids about the dangers of social media challenges.  “I talk to them and tell them not to try stuff just because they’ve seen someone else do it,” she urged.  Many parents are facing the worst for their children due to popular but potentially harmful social media trends like the “Benadryl Challenge” and the “Choking Challenge.”  Heartbroken parents of a Australian teen girl lost their daughter after she inhaled dangerous chemicals from a deodorant can, otherwise known as “chroming.”  Esra Haynes, a high school student, went into cardiac arrest and sustained irreparable brain damage after taking part in “chroming” while at a friend’s sleepover on March 31.  “They’re asking us to bring a family, friends to say goodbye to our 13-year-old daughter.

"explosion","2023-06-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-24T14:00:00","Netflix has unveiled “King of Clones,” a sensational documentary film featuring unprecedented access to South Korean scientist Hwang Woo-suk, and set a June streaming date.  From human cloning research to a scandalous downfall, the documentary tells the story of Korea’s most notorious scientist Hwang Woo-suk. Armed with a degree in veterinary science and a masters and doctorate in theriogenology, the study of animal reproduction, Hwang’s rise to prominence started with his successful cloning of cows and pigs. In 2002, Hwang embarked upon human cloning research and partnered with Moon Shin-yong, an obstetrician with expertise in in-vitro fertilization. Their collaboration led to a major announcement in 2004, claiming the successful cloning of human embryos, with the potential to cure some diseases. The announcement fueled a heated debate on bioethics, despite Hwang and Moon emphasizing that their work focused solely on therapeutic purposes and strongly opposing reproductive cloning.  However, the tide turned against Hwang in November of that year when he admitted to utilizing human eggs donated by two of his own researchers – an ethical breach that shook the scientific community. Despite Hwang’s insistence that the researchers had willingly made the donations, suspicions of coercion emerged, forcing him to step down from his position as director of the World Stem Cell Hub. Despite this, Hwang retained significant public support in South Korea, with hundreds of women volunteering to donate their eggs. In 2006, Hwang’s position at the Seoul National University was terminated and he later moved to Abu Dhabi where he continued his cloning research under the patronage of Sheikh Mansour.  “King of Clones,” a Netflix U.K. commission is directed by Indian origin, London-based Singaporean filmmaker Aditya Thayi via his Peddling Pictures, which he founded with former Endemol Shine head of line production Kavitha Wijeyaratne in 2017. Thayi has 20 nominations and five wins at the Asian television awards, including two wins for best direction. Peddling Pictures’ latest production, “Riot Island” was selected as one of Variety‘s 15 buzz titles at the 2023 London Screenings and won three prizes at the 2023 New York Festivals Film & TV Awards.  Thayi found out about Hwang fortuitously three years ago. “Before the birth of my first son, I was, for some very strange reason really paranoid that my son was going to come out deformed. And I was actually looking into science of birth and IVF. And then I realized that a lot of these kids born in the 1980s in India were really scarred by the Bhopal Gas Tragedy. I remember seeing thalidomide kids, polio kids, there was a lot of deformity growing up, I think that had probably had some part to play with my own anxiety about before the birth of my own son. I was looking into it and came across some stories about human cloning,” Thayi told Variety.  In preparation for “King of Clones,” Thayi produced “Deciphering South Korea,” a four-part Channel News Asia series that looked at some of the pressing and complex issues in the country. “We are very aware that we are not Koreans telling this story. But in some way it liberated us to tell it without any attachment, but still with our own unique Asian sensibilities,” Thayi said. “We set out to make a film about what happens when the domain of the Gods intersects the domain of scientists and Hwang’s life gave us the material to speak of the various themes we wanted to touch upon.”  It took nine months of writing to Hwang to get access to him and Thayi finally met him and stayed with him at his villa in the grounds of a seven-star hotel in the middle of a desert in Abu Dhabi, owned by Sheikh Mansour. Hwang told Thayi that he receives on an average 50 interview requests a month from American and Korean news organizations, but turns all of them down.  “There’s a reason why he said ‘yes’ to me, and I probably think it’s because I was this Asian international, he felt like he could trust me to tell his version of the story – and definitely not being Korean helped me in my access,” Thayi said.  “I went into this film thinking that I was going to find a crazy monster in the science, but I find that the science – there’s nothing really wrong with it, it’s pretty solid. I think it’s just as human beings, we’ve not really had discussions about where the science can take us,” Thayi added. “It has been possible to clone a human being for at least 10 years, the scientific ability is there, it’s just that somebody somewhere has to just do it. And then you’ll have to reckon with it. But I fear that we’ve not really spent so much time thinking about it.”  Thayi describes Hwang as a “polarizing figure” in Korea and wanted to do an objective take on him. “I could give him space to explain where he came from and even hold him accountable to it. The fact that in some way we were very aware that we wanted to demand an apology from him for all that he has done and in some way he did do that, say sorry, ‘I’m sorry, but this is who I am, like me or not,’ and I admire that,” Thayi said.  “King of Clones” is produced by Syahirah A. Karim and executive produced by Wijeyaratne and Thayi. It is shot by Colm Whelan (IFTA winner for “1916 A Terrible Beauty”) and Neil Harvey (BAFTA nominee for “Untouchable”), edited by Simon Barker (BAFTA nominee for “American Murder: The Family Next Door”) and features a score by Dan Deacon (“Hustle”). It streams on Netflix from June 23.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9nbG9iYWwvYXNpYS9odW1hbi1jbG9uaW5nLWRvY3VtZW50YXJ5LWh3YW5nLXdvby1zdWstbmV0ZmxpeC0xMjM1NjIzNjg4L9IBZGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9nbG9iYWwvYXNpYS9odW1hbi1jbG9uaW5nLWRvY3VtZW50YXJ5LWh3YW5nLXdvby1zdWstbmV0ZmxpeC0xMjM1NjIzNjg4L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"explosion","2023-07-28","15:26:00","{""Knoxville"", ""Tennessee"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-24T13:02:49","Led by Kelly Chipps of the Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory, scientists working in the lab have produced a signature nuclear reaction that occurs on the surface of a neutron star gobbling mass from a companion star. Their achievement improves understanding of stellar processes generating diverse nuclear isotopes.  “Neutron stars are really fascinating from the points of view of both nuclear physics and astrophysics,” said ORNL nuclear astrophysicist Kelly Chipps, who led a study published in Physical Review Letters. “A deeper understanding of their dynamics may help reveal the cosmic recipes of elements in everything from people to planets.”  Chipps heads the Jet Experiments in Nuclear Structure and Astrophysics, or JENSA, which has collaborators from nine institutions in three countries. The team uses a unique gas jet target system, which produces the world’s highest-density helium jet for accelerator experiments, to understand nuclear reactions that proceed with the same physics on Earth as in outer space.  The process of nucleosynthesis creates new atomic nuclei. One element can turn into another when protons or neutrons are captured, exchanged or expelled.  A neutron star has an immense gravitational pull that can capture hydrogen and helium from a nearby star. The material amasses on the neutron star surface until it ignites in repeated explosions that create new chemical elements.  Many nuclear reactions powering the explosions remain unstudied. Now, JENSA collaborators have produced one of these signature nuclear reactions in a lab at Michigan State University. It directly constrains the theoretical model typically used to predict element formation and improves understanding of the stellar dynamics that generate isotopes.  Built at ORNL and now at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams, a DOE Office of Science user facility that MSU operates, the JENSA system provides a target of lightweight gas that is dense, pure and localized within a couple millimeters. JENSA will also provide the primary target for the Separator for Capture Reactions, or SECAR, a detector system at FRIB that allows experimental nuclear astrophysicists to directly measure the reactions that power exploding stars. Co-author Michael Smith of ORNL and Chipps are members of SECAR’s project team.  For the current experiment, the scientists struck a target of alpha particles (helium-4 nuclei) with a beam of argon-34. (The number after an isotope indicates its total number of protons and neutrons.) The result of that fusion produced calcium-38 nuclei, which have 20 protons and 18 neutrons. Because those nuclei were excited, they ejected protons and ended up as potassium-37 nuclei.  High-resolution charged-particle detectors surrounding the gas jet precisely measured energies and angles of the proton reaction products. The measurement took advantage of detectors and electronics developed at ORNL under the leadership of nuclear physicist Steven Pain. Accounting for the conservation of energy and momentum, the physicists back-calculated to discover the dynamics of the reaction.  “Not only do we know how many reactions occurred, but also we know the specific energy that the final potassium-37nucleus ended up in, which is one of the components predicted by the theoretical model,” Chipps said.  The lab experiment improves understanding of nuclear reactions that occur when material falls onto the surface of an important subset of neutron stars. These stars are born when a massive star runs out of fuel and collapses into a sphere about as wide as a city such as Atlanta, Georgia. Then gravity squeezes fundamental particles as close together as they can get, creating the densest matter we can directly observe. One teaspoon of neutron star would weigh as much as a mountain. Neutron-packed stars rotate faster than blender blades and make the universe’s strongest magnets. They have solid crusts surrounding liquid cores containing material shaped like spaghetti or lasagna noodles, earning them the nickname “nuclear pasta.”  “Because neutron stars are so weird, they are a useful naturally occurring laboratory to test how neutron matter behaves under extreme conditions,” Chipps said.  Achieving that understanding takes teamwork. Astronomers observe the star and collect data. Theoreticians try to understand physics inside the star. Nuclear physicists measure nuclear reactions in the lab and test them against models and simulations. That analysis reduces large uncertainties resulting from a dearth of experimental data. “When you put all of those things together, you really start to understand what’s happening,” Chipps said.  “Because the neutron star is superdense, its huge gravity can pull hydrogen and helium over from a companion star. As this material falls to the surface, the density and temperature grow so high that a thermonuclear explosion can occur that can propagate across the surface,” Chipps said. Thermonuclear runaway transforms nuclei into heavier elements. “The reaction sequence can produce dozens of elements.”  Surface explosions do not destroy the neutron star, which goes right back to what it was doing before: feeding off its companion and exploding. Repeated explosions pull crust material into the mix, creating a bizarre composition in which heavy elements formed during previous explosions react with lightweight hydrogen and helium.  Theoretical models predict which elements form. Scientists typically analyze the reaction that the JENSA team measured using a statistical theoretical model called the Hauser-Feshbach formalism, which assumes that a continuum of excited energy levels of a nucleus can participate in a reaction. Other models instead assume that only a single energy level participates.  “We’re testing the transition between the statistical model being valid or invalid,” Chipps said. “We want to understand where that transition happens. Because Hauser-Feshbach is a statistical formalism — it relies on having a large number of energy levels so effects over each individual level are averaged out — we’re looking for where that assumption starts to break down. For nuclei like magnesium-22 and argon-34, there’s an expectation that the nucleus doesn’t have enough levels for this averaging approach to be valid. We wanted to test that.”  A question remained about whether the statistical model was valid for such reactions taking place in stars rather than earthly laboratories. “Our result has shown that the statistical model is valid for this particular reaction, and that removes a tremendous uncertainty from our understanding of neutron stars,” Chipps said. “It means that we now have a better grasp of how those nuclear reactions are proceeding.”  Next, the researchers will try to improve the statistical model by further testing its limits. A past paper explored atomic mass 22, a magnesium nucleus, and found the model incorrect by almost a factor of 10. The current ORNL-led paper, probing 12 atomic mass units above this, found that the model correctly predicted reaction rates.  “Somewhere between [atomic] mass 20 and 30, this transition between where the statistical model is valid and where it’s not valid is taking place,” Chipps said. “The next thing is to look for reactions in the middle of that range to see where this transition is occurring.” Chipps and her JENSA collaborators have begun that endeavor.  The title of the paper is “First direct measurement of the 34Ar(α,p)37K reaction cross section for mixed hydrogen and helium burning in accreting neutron stars.”  DOE’s Office of Science, the National Science Foundation and ORNL’s Laboratory Directed Research and Development program supported the work.

Fairfax County wants to take a closer look.  Example video title will go here for this video  FAIRFAX COUNTY, Va. — Fairfax County wants to put in guardrails for data centers.  For several years communities across Northern Virginia have expressed outrage about the explosion of data centers in the area. From Prince William County to Fauquier County, neighbors have tried to grapple with the explosion of centers being built.  It’s not going away anytime soon.  According to the Virginia Economic Development Partnership, Northern Virginia is home to around 50% of the U.S.’s data centers. It is estimated that roughly 20% of the world’s data flows through them on any given day.  “We have 11 in Fairfax County, but they are tiny by comparison to the jurisdictions around us,” said Jeff McKay, chairman of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors.  Fairfax County has a relatively small data center footprint, but with five new centers on the way, county leaders want to step up regulations.  “We had been treating [data centers] like telecommunication facilities. As if they are phone switching stations,” McKay explained.  McKay has asked the county’s staff to examine the environmental concerns, power grid issues, and best practices for data centers across the country. Then enact regulations for zoning.  “[Regulations] that enables them to be built but only strict criteria and only in places where it’s appropriate,” McKay said.  McKay wants the guidance from the county’s research back by the end of the year. He hopes the new regulations the county writes can be used across Northern Virginia.  “We hope we can come up with some model language that other jurisdictions can use as well,” he said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnd1c2E5LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvdmlyZ2luaWEvZmFpcmZheC1jb3VudHktZGF0YS1jZW5ldGVycy1jb25jZXJucy82NS0zOTcyMjM4MS1iYzJkLTQ4ZjItYmFjYi0wMmNiOWE4ZGFkOTfSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3VzYTkuY29tL2FtcC9hcnRpY2xlL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvdmlyZ2luaWEvZmFpcmZheC1jb3VudHktZGF0YS1jZW5ldGVycy1jb25jZXJucy82NS0zOTcyMjM4MS1iYzJkLTQ4ZjItYmFjYi0wMmNiOWE4ZGFkOTc?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(UK Athletics Photo)  Former Kentucky Miss Basketball Brooklynn Miles was a star player at Franklin County High School that Kentucky tried to recruit but she opted to go to Tennessee where she played in 56 games the last two years.  However, Miles is now returning to the Bluegrass to play for Kentucky coach Krya Elzy.  Miles put her name into the transfer portal after the season ended and announced on social media Monday she was heading back to Kentucky to play. Two other former Kentucky Miss Basketballs, Maddie Scherr of Ryle and Amiya Jenkins of Anderson County, are also on the UK roster.  “The coaching staff and I couldn’t be more excited to welcome Brooklynn back home. She is a proud hometown girl, who understands the responsibility of wearing Kentucky across her chest. Not to mention, she’ll join Amiya and Maddie as a trio of Miss Kentucky Basketball honorees on one team,” Elzy said in a release from UK  “On the court, Brooklynn is an explosive guard, which will fit our up-tempo style of play, and she is a tenacious defender. Brooklynn has a competitive mindset, and she is ready to get to work for the upcoming season.”  Her addition could help offset the loss of starting point guard Jada Walker, who transferred to Baylor.

The use of heavy explosive weapons is often the standard choice by belligerents, a choice that has devastating, and frequently illegal, consequences on communities – including children, the elderly, and persons with disabilities.  I saw for myself the destruction of Aleppo and other urban centres across Syria. But not only - from Ukraine to Sudan, from Gaza to Yemen, the ICRC sees the tremendous harm that heavy explosive weapons cause, directly and indirectly.  These weapons include large bombs and missiles, heavy artillery, inaccurate rockets, and large improvised explosive devices.  Today, I call on all States and parties to armed conflict to avoid the use of heavy explosive weapons in populated areas, due to the significant likelihood of indiscriminate effects.  The ask is clear: explosive weapons should not be used in populated areas unless sufficient mitigation measures are taken to limit their area effects and the risks of civilian harm.  Avoiding the use of explosive weapons in populated areas will significantly decrease civilian suffering. It will also facilitate respect for international humanitarian law, which requires that explosive weapons are used in compliance with the rules of distinction, proportionality and precaution.  When heavy explosive weapons are used in populated areas, compliance with international humanitarian law is often very difficult. Reviewing and adapting existing military policy and practice is necessary to make it happen.  The Political Declaration on Explosive Weapons in Populated Areas is a groundbreaking achievement and a crucial step forward.  It is the first instrument committing States to curb the use of explosive weapons in populated areas. If properly implemented, it can contribute significantly to alleviating civilian suffering and to strengthening respect for international humanitarian law.  I commend the 83 States that have already endorsed the declaration and committed to take concrete action to change the unacceptable status quo.  I urge all States that have not yet done so to join the declaration without delay.  The Political Declaration is an important tool. Provided it is followed by decisive action, its key commitments can improve the fate of hundreds of thousands, if not more, around the world.  Last year, ICRC published an indepth report (Explosive weapons with wide areas effects: A deadly choice in populated areas) to provide detailed practical recommendations to political authorities and armed forces on measures to reduce civilian harm.  ICRC is today also sharing our new comprehensive report, War in Cities, containing key recommendations to avoid harm to civilians during urban hostilities.  All States have a stake in strengthening respect for international humanitarian law – those engaged in urban warfare or directly affected by it; those suffering the impacts of food and energy insecurity from the effects of bombing and shelling; those hosting people who have fled across borders.  The tremendous civilian harm we witness today must not be considered a normal by-product of armed conflict. We all have a role to play in changing this narrative and in working towards minimizing the heartbreaking impacts of wars in populated areas on civilians.  Thank you.

The Crown charged Séchoirs de Beauce and Bois Ouvré de Beauceville on May 19 with three charges of negligence causing death and five charges of negligence causing bodily harm.  In September 2021, five people were injured following a fiery explosion at the Séchoirs de Beauce et Bois Ouvré factory.  Some of the injuries were so serious that people had to be intubated and transferred to the trauma unit at Enfant-Jésus Hospital in Quebec City, about 80 kilometres away, for more specialized care.  Jean Lachance, 51, of Saint-Georges, Mario Morin, 57, of Beauceville and Martin Roy, 50, of Saint-Georges died in the explosion. They were members of the Syndicat des Métallos.  Suzy Roy, the sister of Martin Roy, who was killed, says she was happy when she heard about the criminal charges because she never wants this to happen to anyone else.  ""This is for the memory of my brother and also the new employees. Whether it be this company or another. The safety and security of people while they're at work is important,"" said Roy. ""So people can come home after their shift.""  'This is what workers have been asking for,' says union  Julie Hébert, the health and safety co-ordinator for the union, says she thought about the victims' families when she heard about the criminal charges. She said this incident continues to take a toll on the community.  ""The union will continue to provide support and assistance,"" said Hébert. ""We hope that this case will be a breakthrough and lead to more charges being pressed in cases of fatalities and critical injury.""  She says the Crown can press charges against a private company in part due to the Westray Law — an amendment introduced in 2004 after a deadly coal mine explosion in Nova Scotia.  ""These amendments were made so that companies could be held criminally responsible,"" said Hébert, adding that these types of charges are rare.  ""This is what workers have been asking for many years, that all workplace fatalities and critical injuries be analyzed through a criminal lens,"" said Hébert.  Martine Savard, the prosecutor looking over this case, said although the case is criminal, company representatives will not face jail time, if found guilty.  ""It's really the company that is subject to a fine,"" said Savard. ""There is no maximum or minimum fine. So the court really has the power to impose the penalty that is appropriate in the circumstances""  The companies are expected in court on June 9.  In a statement Bois Ouvré Beauceville says it's taken note of the charges but will not comment further while the matter is before the courts out of respect for the families.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL2NhbmFkYS9tb250cmVhbC9sdW1iZXItcGxhbnQtYmVhdWNldmlsbGUtZXhwbG9zaW9uLWNyaW1pbmFsLW5lZ2xpZ2VuY2UtMS42ODUzMTk00gEgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JjLmNhL2FtcC8xLjY4NTMxOTQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"explosion","1945-07-16","Not Discerned","{""Nagasaki"", ""Nagasaki"", ""Japan""}","2023-05-24T13:46:37","There’s no doubt that, if he could have, Christopher Nolan would have blown up a real nuclear bomb for his next big movie: Oppenheimer. The filmmaker is a practical effects nut and not too keen on CGI, so considering his feature is about the creator of the atomic bomb, he obviously had to try his best to make his bomb real and not digital… and he’s more or less succeeded.  Although in the end they didn’t let him use a real nuclear bomb – not bad, I guess -, the director got away with it and used a bomb made from practical effects. That is to say, without using any CGI or after-the-fact effects beyond small details. The result, from what they are selling, has been spectacular. But how exactly did they do it?  Materials used for the Oppenheimer explosion  The film’s special effects supervisor, Scott R. Fisher, explained in an interview for Total Film how the sequence was shot, and his words make it clear that Nolan’s entire team is as crazy as he is… or even crazier.  “It’s like an old-school technique. We don’t call it miniatures; we call them gran-aturas [‘big-atures’ in English],” he explains, putting to rest rumors that scale models were used. “We make them as big as we can, although we reduce the scale to make it manageable. It’s about getting it close to the camera and making it as big as possible in the environment.”  But what was that bomb made of that they detonated for the film? Fisher has also explained it:  “It’s mostly gasoline, propane, any of that kind of stuff, because you can get a lot with your budget. But we also put in things like aluminum and magnesium powder to enhance the shine and give it a concrete look… We did it because we wanted everyone to talk about that flash, that shine. So we tried to replicate it as best we could.”  The explosion recreates the U.S. attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki (Japan) in August 1945, which ended World War II and caused disastrous consequences for decades. But this is not the first time Nolan has done something like this. In Tenet, his previous film, the director blew up a real Boeing 747. And in Dunkirk, much of the tanks, planes and so on were real.  Oppenheimer will be released on July 21, the same day as Barbie, and will star Cillian Murphy. It is undoubtedly Nolan’s most ambitious film, as well as the longest (2 hours and 50 minutes), thus joining other proposals such as Killers of the flower moon.

Soyud completed a huge defensive stop, blocking Rodney Brondial before Phoenix located Tio, who nailed a booming right wing triple in the next possession to put Phoenix ahead for good, 102-101.  The Fuel Masters held on to their defense in the next play before JJ Alejandro threaded a beautiful bounce pass in the middle of the Beermen defense to Soyud, who then scored a clutch under goal stab to give his team some more breathing space, 103-101, with 26 seconds to go.  It was total import for Phoenix which had eight players scoring in double-figures led by the suddenly offensive-minded Simon Camacho, who finished with 15 points apart from his eight rebounds.  Tio contributed 14 points, Larry Muyang and RR Garcio with 11 points apiece while Soyud, Alejandro, Sean Manganti and Kurt Lojera finished with 10 points each.  The balanced scoring proved to be enough for Phoenix to survive a fiery offensive display from Romeo, who put up his best performance since returning from a slew of injuries with 27 points.  Robbie Herndon also erupted for 21 points – 13 came in the third frame when SMB cut the lead down to just three, 81-78, before Phoenix responded with a strong closeout to the quarter to reestablish an 11-point lead, 89-78 advantage heading into the final frame.  The Beermen, behind Mo Tautuaa who dropped 10 of 16 points in the final frame, still rallied back and even took a 101-98 lead with 2:23 to go.  The efforts however went down the drain as even whe SMB still had the chance to come close after Phoenix reclaimed the lead, the three point attempts from Herndon and Jericho Cruz both came up dry in the end.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vbWIuY29tLnBoLzIwMjMvNS8yNC90aW8tc295dWQtY2x1dGNoLWFzLXBob2VuaXgtc3Vydml2ZXMtc21iLWV4cGxvc2lvbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(Image credit: Carins Airport)  An unusual green meteor recently exploded as it plummeted through the sky over Australia, giving off a brilliant flash of light that could be seen for miles and a loud bang that stunned local residents below.  Cameras at Cairns Airport in Queensland captured a video of the exploding meteor, known as a bolide, at 9:22 p.m. local time on May 20. Video footage uploaded to the airport's Facebook page shows an initial green flash lighting up the night sky before a secondary white flash.  Additional footage captured on smartphones, dashcams and security cameras showed that the flash was visible as far away as Normanton, which is around 370 miles (600 kilometers) west of Cairns, The Guardian reported. The sound of the explosion could be heard most clearly above the town of Croydon, which is around 60 miles (100 km) east of Normanton, suggesting that the meteor exploded somewhere overhead.  The space rock was likely quite small, between 1.6 and 3.2 feet (0.5 and 1 meter) across, and could have been traveling up to 93,000 mph (150,000 km/h), Brad Tucker , an astrophysicist at Australian National University in Canberra, told The Guardian. Any fragments that crashed to Earth would likely have been very small and were likely still frozen, he added.  Related: Extremely rare fireball meteor may have sparked a blaze that burned down a California home  A still of the initial green flash given off by the meteor. (Image credit: Carins Airport)  Bolides are meteors that blow up in Earth's atmosphere due to a buildup of friction that eventually causes the space rocks to instantaneously shatter with enough force to trigger a sonic boom, according to the American Meteor Society .  The meteor ""essentially does a belly flop,"" Tucker said. ""The friction builds up and causes that glow and then it hits breaking point, which causes the huge flash and the sonic boom.""  Most bolides emit a white or yellow light when they explode. The unusual green flash of the meteor that exploded above Croydon was caused by a high concentration of metals such as iron and nickel in the meteor, Tucker said.  Similar green light can also be given off by fireball meteors, which are extremely bright meteors that break apart in Earth's atmosphere but do not explode with the same intensity. In August 2022, a green fireball was spotted above New Zealand , and in November 2022, another one crashed into Lake Ontario .  Bolides occur in Earth's atmosphere relatively frequently. Between July 2017 and January 2022, astronomers detected around 3,000 bolides, according to NASA's Earth Observatory . But observers on the ground witness only a few of these blasts each year, because most of the explosions happen away from populated areas or above the ocean.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlc2NpZW5jZS5jb20vc3BhY2UvbWV0ZW9yb2lkcy9yYXJlLWdyZWVuLWZpcmViYWxsLWV4cGxvZGVzLW92ZXItYXVzdHJhbGlhLWNyZWF0aW5nLWJyaWdodC1mbGFzaC12aXNpYmxlLWZvci1odW5kcmVkcy1vZi1taWxlc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"explosion","2014-10-07","Not Discerned","{""NewYork"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-24T21:33:00","To close out today’s PlayStation Showcase, Sony and Insomniac pulled out the big webs for a new look at Spider-Man 2. The long-awaited sequel is now targeting a release this fall, and an extended gameplay sequence showed us what we can expect.  An opening cinematic reveals some insight into the villainous Kraven the Hunter. Tired of easy prey in the deep jungle, one of his minions suggests a move to a new hunting ground in New York, where the likes of Spider-Man, Black Cat, and Tombstone promise more challenging targets.  The action jumps to six months later in Queens, as a black-suited Peter Parker bursts from a basement to battle some of the Hunter’s goons. The gameplay sequence that follows is impressive, showing off Spider-Man’s new symbiote abilities, which allow for an array of tentacle attacks that can often bring down many opponents at once.  After the battle, Peter learns Kraven’s team is hunting Doctor Connors, otherwise known as the Lizard. And since the hunt is happening in Harlem, he won’t be able to get there in time. He immediately calls Miles, and the perspective changes, suggesting the game (while single-player) allows for change-ups between the two Spider-Man leads.  Miles has some new tricks of his own, including some slick wingsuit capabilities that send him zipping at high speed between buildings, and web lines that let him chart his own path to taking down foes from above during stealth passages.  After a sequence trying to track down the Lizard, we learn that Connors has shed his skin and is clearly growing into a larger reptilian form, with an equally larger appetite. After linking up with his friend, Ganke, and the ominous arrival of Peter in his black symbiote suit, a thrilling chase sequence ensues down the East River, where Peter and Miles are taking down drones, jet skis, and boats as Kraven’s team chases the Lizard.  While it’s not clear why Peter and Miles are so interested in saving the Lizard (traditionally a villain in the stories), there seems to be some information they need from him, making his survival a must.  The rest of the gameplay sequence is equally exciting, from a crash into the water to a headlong escape along the water as The Lizard tries to attack from below. From animation to pacing to camera work – the entire sequence looks like it wouldn’t feel out of place in the next Marvel Cinematic Universe film. Except, of course, Spider-Man 2 is a fully interactive experience where players control the two Spider-Men along the way.  As the extended demo winds down, we see Peter acting in a very un-Peter way, doubling down on aggressive and dangerous tendencies he’s been showing throughout the sequence, leaving Miles worried about his friend and mentor.  Amid several notable reveals and new videos over the course of the PlayStation Showcase this afternoon, Spider-Man 2 stood out for its remarkable polish, taut action, and a focus on complete and uncut gameplay sequences. The game looks fantastic and is one to watch closely in the lead-up to its launch later this year.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhbWVpbmZvcm1lci5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8yNC93YXRjaC1tYXJ2ZWxzLXNwaWRlci1tYW4tMnMtZmlyc3QtZXhwbG9zaXZlLWdhbWVwbGF5LXNlcXVlbmNl0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2FtZWluZm9ybWVyLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzI0L3dhdGNoLW1hcnZlbHMtc3BpZGVyLW1hbi0ycy1maXJzdC1leHBsb3NpdmUtZ2FtZXBsYXktc2VxdWVuY2U_YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

One detail that may annoy some players is that Alan Wake II will only be available digitally on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.

You can buy a Sony PlayStation 5 without a disc drive and Microsoft's Xbox Series S is a digital only console. It is not uncommon to release modern games as digital-only. Secondly, not releasing a disc helps keep the price of the game at $59.99 / €59.99 and the PC version at $49.99 / €49.99.

Photo:Getty  Ireland must urgently follow the Scandinavian example of tightening controls on dog breeding, and enforce tough animal-welfare penalties.  The call has been made by animal-welfare charities after an alarming surge in complaints over cruelty to animals over the past two years.  In Kerry, a pony had to be rescued from an upstairs building, while in Tipperary 27 dogs were found in appalling conditions, many suffering from parasitic diseases, while variously chained to a tree, or locked in metal cages.  The Cork-based Donkey Sanctuary expressed shock at the abandonment of 20 donkeys in Galway.  Five of the donkeys either died or had to be euthanised to ease their suffering.  Four pregnant mares and three foals arrived at the sanctuary’s facilities in March after the complex rescue operation. Eight others have been rehomed after receiving vital medical attention.  In another case, a dog in Kerry required specialist veterinary care after its drunk owner attacked the frightened pet with a broken bottle.  In Dublin, a Japanese Spitz was discovered so neglected that it was virtually being eaten alive by maggots.  Animal-welfare charities and activists now want Ireland to adopt the Swedish approach to pet ownership – and in particular to dog breeding. They have called for tighter regulation.  Incredibly, while Irish animal shelters are struggling to cope with the explosion in the number of abandoned animals, countries like Sweden have no animal rescues.  Dogs Trust Ireland confirmed it has taken in 1,357 unwanted dogs since January 1, amid an explosion in the number of surrendered pets.  ISPCA chief inspector Conor Dowling said they had 20 successful court outcomes in respect of animal-cruelty cases in 2022.  But the seizure of large numbers of animals – mostly dogs – has put enormous strain on ISPCA resources, and it has had to rely on private kennels for additional capacity.  Donkey Sanctuary Ireland director Laura Foster said that prevention and strong legal deterrents are the only sustainable solution for all agencies involved in animal welfare.  “We will be increasing our education and support activities to reach as many donkeys as we can. However, this work can only be effective alongside robust law enforcement, which is why our relationship with government veterinary inspectors, the gardaí, and the ISPCA is so important.  “We must also tackle the donkey population issue through castration and effective end-of-life decision-making. Too often, we see suffering that could have been prevented or stopped much sooner.  “Unfortunately, had we been contacted a lot sooner this [the Galway] case could have been dealt with. Intervention is a key step to a positive outcome.”  Sera Husky Animal Rescue operator Maurice Enright said the Government needs to take action. He told Radio Kerry that certain other European countries “do not even need to have animal rescues”.  ""The Government should look at these countries and see why they don’t have these problems – they don’t even need dog wardens.  “It is time to put in practices and introduce legislation to make it harder for people to either breed or get dogs.”  Countries such as Germany have a special assessment before a person is allowed to own a dog.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmllL2lyaXNoLW5ld3MvcGxlYS1mb3ItdG91Z2gtcmVndWxhdGlvbi1hbWlkLWV4cGxvc2lvbi1pbi1pbmNpZGVudHMtb2YtYW5pbWFsLWNydWVsdHkvYTE2NTg2NTkwMjguaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"explosion","2022-09-03","Not Discerned","{""Memphis"", ""Tennessee"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-25T02:17:12","Do you love fantasy football? Want to enjoy even more gridiron action every weekend? College Fantasy Football (CFF) is the premier way to expand your football obsession and enjoy a new challenge in our marvelous hobby.  Across the fantasy football world, the explosion in popularity of DEVY leagues has taken the community by storm. More and more leagues are going to this concept of including developmental players from college football on rosters to be used only when they enter the NFL.  With this new form of fantasy football, managers began to monitor the college ranks more intensely; since they now have a vested interest in how their DEVY players are performing. From that, interest grew so rapidly, managers no longer wanted to just wait for those players to wear NFL uniforms. Instead, the advent of CFF began to become more popular.  There’s no such thing as too much football! 2022 is the perfect time to add the college game to your fantasy football repertoire. Whether you want to create your own league or join an existing league, the Fantrax College Football Commissioner is the place to go!  College Fantasy Football 101  In CFF, managers are playing the same type of fantasy football where players receive points for yards, receptions, and touchdowns; and depending on the league, even more avenues to score points like points for first downs, gains over 40 yards, or completions. However, playing fantasy football with NFL players and NCAA players can be, at times, different.  One area in which the two games are different is the player pool in CFF is much greater than in the NFL. This can make doing homework on potential players a lot more challenging because there are more teams and players to research. Another area that has made CFF very challenging is the transfer portal which sees thousands of athletes moving from one team to another.  We will cover some of the best-used strategies to start in your first CFF league and how to prepare for your first draft.  Winning Strategies for CFF  Strategy #1: Do not draft players from just the games you watch on ESPN or ABC!  I know it’s easy to think that College Football is all about Georgia, Alabama, and Notre Dame. However, you would be incredibly wrong to think that about CFF.  Just because teams or players are not regularly seen on tv highlights, does not mean they won’t be valuable commodities in CFF. Some of the best players in CFF are not from traditional football powers.  Some of the lesser-known teams that have players you should target:  Western Kentucky, Georgia Southern, SMU, UTSA, Tulane, James Madison, Memphis, Appalachian St, North Texas, East Carolina, Memphis, Toledo, Fresno St, Georgia St  Each of these teams scores plenty of points to warrant consideration of their key skill players being drafted. You may not get to see these teams regularly in prime time, but they are worth using for CFF.  Strategy #2: Follow the teams that move the ball  One of the great indicators in drafting successful fantasy players in CFF is to follow the yards.  The table below lists the Top 10 teams in yards gained per game in 2022.  School Yards Gained per game Tennessee 525.5 Washington 515..8 USC 506.6 UCLA 503.6 Georgia 501.1 Oregon 500.5 Western Kentucky 497.3 Ole Miss 496.4 Ohio St 490.7 Florida St 484.2  Yes, many of those teams are well-known schools; except for Western Kentucky, I’m sure that surprised you a bit. Looking farther down the list of yards per game, it includes:  UTSA (Univ. of Texas – San Antonio) at 476 yards per game (ypg.) SMU (Southern Methodist University) at 472.8 ypg. Georgia Southern at 465.9 ypg. North Texas at 461.8 ypg. East Carolina at 461.1 ypg. Appalachian St. at 455.3 ypg.  I hope by seeing this list, CFF freshmen have a better understanding that teams with offenses to draft on rosters are not just from Power 5 Conference teams. So, when drafting for CFF rosters, managers have to understand the “universe” that exists of players to draft exceeds over 31,000 college football players. With that quantity of players, savvy managers will not limit themselves by just taking players on Top 25 teams, but from many of those schools listed above based on their ability to move the ball up and down the field.  CFF managers need to diversify their repertoire of teams and players to best maximize a fantasy team’s potential while also balancing their rosters with marquee players from national powers. Want a chance to see these high-powered offenses? Check out these marquee games on the schedule and get ready for some fireworks!  Games to Watch for CFF Fans in 2023  September 16th, Western Kentucky versus Ohio St  September 23rd, UTSA versus Tennessee  October 12th, East Carolina versus SMU  October 14th, Georgia Southern versus James Madison  November 4th, Washington versus USC  November 10th, North Texas versus SMU  November 25th, Georgia Southern versus Appalachian St.  Strategy #3: Names of Players you DEFINITELY should know for your draft!  The names listed below are some of the most recognized names in college football; with many of these players seeing their names already being hyped as first-round picks in the 2024 NFL Draft.  QB WR RB TE Caleb Wiliams (USC) Marvin Harrison Jr (OSU) Quinshon Judkins (MISS) Brock Bowers (GA) Drake Maye (UNC) Emeka Egbuka (OSU) Raheim Sanders (ARJ) Oronde Gadsden (SYR) Bo Nix (ORE) Rome Odunze (WAS) Braelon Allen (WI) Ja’Tavion Sanders (TX) Michael Penix Jr (WASH) Xavier Worthy (TX) Blake Corum (MI) Brady Nesbit (UNC) Jordan Travis (FSU) Troy Franklin (ORE) Nick Singleton (Penn St) Ben Yurosek (STAN)  Strategy #4: Names of Players you might not know, but DEFINITELY should know for your draft!  I’m going to make you a top 5 list of the players at each position that should be on your radar for your draft that may not be household names. This list could be a lot longer, so take this as a quick reference guide for players to be aware of heading into your draft. If you see players on the list, you are familiar with, then GREAT! You are already ahead of most other CFF newcomers.  QB WR RB TE Austin Reed (WKY) Malachi Corley (WKY) Rasheen Ali (MAR) Brant Kuithe (Utah) Frank Harris (UTSA) Tory Horton (CSU) Frank Gore Jr (USM) Jalin Conyers (ASU) Riley Leonard (DUKE) Derwin Burgess (GASO) Sieh Bangura (OHIO) Brady Hunt (BALL) Michael Pratt (TUL) Zakhari Franklin (n/a) Damien Martinez (ORE St) RJ Maryland (SMU) Dillon Gabriel (OK) Sam Wiglusz (OHIO) Kevorian Barnes (UTSA) Caden Prieskorn (MISS)  Strategy #5: Pay Attention to the Transfer Portal  This can be a very tricky strategy for players who are still learning. So, I will provide you a list to use during your draft that will help you navigate through drafting players that are on new teams. This list is not exhaustive (how could it be?) but it should provide you with some basic knowledge of the key players that have changed teams and what to expect in the 2023 season.  Situations have changed, but not necessarily for the better:  Lorenzo Styles (WR), Notre Dame to Ohio St: There is so much competition at the wide receiver position, it will be hard to shine with Marvin Harrison Jr and Emeka Egbuka on the team. I think staying at ND with Sam Hartman would have produced a better fantasy season for Styles.  Brian Battie (RB), USF to Auburn: Battie will see himself in a greater battle for snaps and opportunities as the competition increases at Auburn and the opposition is better in the SEC.  Sean Tyler (RB), Western Michigan to Minnesota: Tyler was a smash at Western Michigan. However, the defenses in the Mid-American are not as stout as the Big Ten. Tyler will regress some this season.  Xavier Weaver (WR), USF to Colorado: Coach Sanders is amassing a lot of talent for the Buffaloes and it will be difficult to decipher the primary receiver for Colorado. As a transfer, I would pay close attention to summer practices to have a better understanding of his situation in Colorado.  Dominic Lovett (WR), Missouri to Georgia: Being a primary receiver for Mizzou, then going to a team with Brock Bowers and Ladd McConkey, may not provide Lovett with the same opportunities.  Zakhari Franklin (WR), UTSA to ?: This is a transfer to pay close attention to as it develops. Franklin posted ridiculous numbers last year by grabbing 93 passes for 1,137 yards and 15 touchdowns. Leaving an offense ranked 12th in yards per game for more exposure may not result in similar fantasy numbers for Franklin.  Dante Cephus (WR), Kent St to Penn St: Cephus was one of the most dynamic playmakers at Kent St during his time there. Now, he heads off to the Big Ten and their more stringent defenses. Cephus hopes to replace the production left behind when Parker Washington was drafted by the NFL, but he won’t match all the production he posted at Kent St.  Tyrin Smith (WR), UTEP to Texas A&M: Smith replaced Jacob Cowing at UTEP as their leading receiver and similarly dominated Conference USA like Cowing. Now, Smith gets set to play against the highest level of athleticism on defense in the SEC. Smith is a talented player, but he will see his numbers dip as he now has to compete against a different level of competition in the SEC.  Carson Steele (RB), Ball St to UCLA: Carson Steele was the exact type of player in CFF that savvy managers would draft from an unheralded team that casual fans are not as familiar with. Steele hopes to continue the success that Zach Carbbonnet has left behind after being drafted by the Seahawks. However, Steele is not guaranteed to amass the yards or the touchdowns he did at Ball St. Steele is still a solid player to draft, just don’t expect the same results.  Situations have changed, and appear to have improved from their previous position:  Adonia (AD) Mitchell (WR), Georgia to Texas: Mitchell leaves a team that has been as explosive as any team over the last two years for a less explosive one and it’s good? Yes, in this situation, it is. Mitchell is leaving a Georgia team without a clear QB in place for Texas and Quinn Ewers (presumptive 1st round pick in the 2024 NFL draft) and a complimentary wide receiver (Xavier Worthy) that will draw most team’s best cornerback.  Brennan Armstrong (QB), Virginia to NC State: Armstrong holds most passing records at Virginia. Now, he replaces Devin Leary as the signal caller for the Wolfpack. Leaving Virginia was not an easy one for Armstrong, but he heads to an offense more apt to show off his abilities.  Shedeur Sanders (QB), Jackson St to Colorado: At the very worst, this is a lateral move. However, the Pac-12 is full of future NFL QBs and the games should be high-scoring. Sanders is the focal point of the Colorado offense and will be the start of the show for Colorado against the likes of USC, UCLA, and Oregon.  Arik Gilbert (TE), Georgia to Nebraska: Georgia is one of the most explosive offenses in college football and is transferring to a team that is transformed by new coach Matt Rhule. His numbers will be better than last year, I just wonder what might have been if Georgia could have found a way to utilize Bowers and Gilbert at the same time. Overall, he will put up better numbers  Sam Hartman (QB), Wake Forest to Notre Dame: Similar to Sanders, this is at least a lateral move for Hartman. He will have better receivers to work with, however, the offense may not be as “high-powered” as it was at Wake Forest. Hartman is the most talented quarterback Notre Dame has had in the last ten years.  Hudson Card (QB), Texas to Purdue: Card may have improved his situation more than most other transfers as he leaves Texas after losing the QB competition to Quinn Ewers. The Purdue offense should suit Card well as he takes over the offense from Aiden O’Connell, who has moved on to the NFL.  DJ Uiagalelei (QB), Clemson to Oregon St: After being unseated by Cade Klubnik at Clemson, Uiagalelei was destined to find a new home after last year. And if he found that home at Oregon St. The story goes, Uiaglelei selected Oregon St having never even visited the campus; he chose the school based solely on its coach and playbook. I think DJ’s skill set is better served as a pocket passer and with the offenses in the Pac-12, Uiagalelei should provide us with big numbers.  Dorian Singer (WR), Arizona to USC: This has everything to do with the “Caleb Williams effect.” USC has the presumptive number 1 pick in the 2024 NFL Draft in Williams and added Singer to be a beneficiary of the elite talent at QB. Singer will have every opportunity to be the go-to receiver in the Trojans offense.  Strategy #6: With your first 3 picks, draft 2 QBs and an RB  This is definitely up to interpretation based on managers. However, as a newcomer, I believe this strategy is the simplest to follow which will maximize your ability to score points weekly.  Somebody in your draft is going to draft Marvin Harrison Jr in the 1st round. And yes, Harrison Jr is an amazing player. And should be a top-three player drafted in next year’s NFL draft. However, the top wide receivers in CFF are not separated by many points to warrant Harrison Jr being selected over players like Bo Nix or Michael Penix Jr.  Guess how many wide receivers were in the top 25 of total fantasy points in 2022? If your answer was ZERO, you would be correct. In case you were wondering, there were also ZERO tight ends. Even running backs are underrepresented with only two backs cracking the top 25 from 2022 (Tyjae Spears and Bijan Robinson).  So you might be asking yourself, if there are that many quarterbacks in the top 25, what’s the rush to draft one?  I’ll give you the simple answer first: Elite QBs are not plentiful. If you can grab Caleb Williams (USC), Drake Maye (UNC), Austin Reed (WKY), or Frank Harris (UTSA), that should be a priority for your team.  Last year, Caleb Williams with 437 (#1 in points scored in CFF)  outscored #2 by 15 points  outscored #5 by 50 points  outscored #25 by 145 points.  Last year, Tyjae Spears with 309 points (#1 points scored as a running back)  outscored #2 by less than 1 point  outscored #5 by 26 points  outscored #25 by 92 points  That’s why I advise you to grab two quarterbacks early in your draft to score the most points possible. In fantasy sports, exploiting an advantage is the key to winning.  In regards to wide receivers, Nathaniel Dell led WRs with 248 points; that’s 189 points lower than Wiliams and 61 points lower than Spears. The differential between Dell and the #2 WR last year was 32 points. However, #2 to #10 was only 41 points. This illustrates that investing in a wide receiver early won’t necessarily net you an advantage in points since the second through the tenth-best wide receivers is minimal.  Because most NCAA teams have 2-to-3 primary receivers, they tend to distribute the fantasy wealth more evenly than at QB or RB; both of which receive a majority of the positional snaps available.  So what about tight ends? That’s a conversation this year that begins and ends with Brock Bowers (Georgia). He should be treated like a wide receiver and drafted accordingly. Bowers outscored the #2 TE by 28 points. However, his overall total was only 165. There will be one manager that takes Bowers in the first round claiming a “monopoly” on the position and a distinct advantage over the competition. However, I will take advantage of having two elite QBs leading my team than a TE; who is dependent on the QB getting him the ball. Did I also mention the Georgia Bulldogs are looking for a new QB to feed Bowers? That’s the other reason I advise letting someone else draft Bowers early, while you load up on QBs and RBs in the earlier rounds of your draft.  Some of my favorite later-round tight ends in CFF  RJ Maryland, SMU Jake Brinningstool, ClEM Erick All, Iowa CJ Dippre, ALA Michael Trigg, MISS Oscar Cardenas, UTSA  There are many different ways to draft your first CFF team. I believe as you are learning how to play the game, drafting two elite QBs is the simplest way to score steady points from week to week. Then, supplement that core with RBs and WRs as you alternate between rounds. Then, take a few of the tight ends listed above to ensure a solid scoring rotation.  As in the NFL game, value is key. Although you may have entered round 6 thinking an RB was your next draft pick, if there is a WR still available from an offense that is high scoring, go grab him! That is how you build a championship team. Have a plan, but be flexible.  Strategy #7: Focus on Upperclassmen, but Don’t shy away from Freshman  Of the Top 25 fantasy point scorers last year, only 14 are returning. And yes, they are all quarterbacks.  We have already discussed the likes of Austin Reed and Frank Harris being on your radar. Most prolific point scorers in the college game are players that have been in their offenses for a few years and understand the playbook and the game. The highest returning player that plays a position other than quarterback is Quinshon Judkins, RB, from Ole Miss. He was the 37th-best fantasy scorer in CFF last year.  Some players that are juniors and seniors who are ready to step into the spotlight:  QBs: KJ Jefferson {Arkansas}, Joe Milton {Tennessee}, Jordan Travis {Florida St} and Jayden Daniels {LSU}  RBs: Re’Mahn Davis {Kentucky}, Jase McClellan {Alabama}, Nate Noel {Appalachian St}, George Holani {Boise St.} and Jermaine Brown Jr {UAB}  WRs: Jacob Cowing {Arizona}, Johnny Wilson {Florida St}, James Thrash {Georgia St}, Antwane Wells, Jr. and {South Carolina}  Not to be outshined by the upperclassmen, there are a few freshmen that project to be impact players in their first year on campus and I would encourage you to draft in the middle to late rounds:  Some freshman phenoms ready to take CFF by storm:  Cedric Baxter, RB, Texas  Zachariah Branch, WR, USC  Dante Moore, QB, UCLA  Rueben Owens, RB, Texas A&M  Strategy #8: Don’t Stress the Small Stuff…Have Fun and Enjoy the Games!  I’m confident when I say that most people playing a fantasy sport for the first time are more often at the bottom of their league rather than at the top. You need to learn how to play the game and focus on what makes the game enjoyable for you. Yes! It can be frustrating to realize you passed on the “next” Marvin Harrison Jr for a player that tears his ACL in week one and their season is done. Don’t stress about things you can’t control. Last year, Jaxon Smith-Njigba was many teams’ #1 WR in drafts, only to get injured, and take the remainder of the season off. It can happen to anyone; even the most seasoned veterans of the game.  In year one, I recommend playing in a Best Ball league.  What is Best Ball? Quite simply, you draft your team, sit back, and watch your team succeed. This type of league requires no in-season moves. The team with the highest accrued points at the end of the year wins. I believe this to be the safest way to enter the world of CFF and requires only a basic knowledge of players and draft strategy.  Best Ball provides you with multiple spots for your “bench” which allows you 6 to 9 players per position in the hopes you draft a few CFF stars. This type of game also takes the guesswork out of trying to predict the best players to start each week. Your best players will play in your lineup. This will allow you to enjoy rooting for your players, not being frustrated having not started a receiver who went for 12 grabs for 139 yards with 2 touchdowns.

"explosion","2023-07-08","Not Discerned","{""Axel"", ""UnitedStates"", ""male""}","2023-05-24T20:30:57","Fanatics of the Water City  Episode 8 of Konosuba: An Explosion On This Wonderful World begins with Yunyun apologizing for delivering the letter. Cecily tells her not to worry since Father Zesta is probably having the time of his life. Cecily asks Megumin and Yunyun if they want her to collect votes. We receive a montage of different members of the Axis Order holding a campaign to become the new leader.  After Megumin and Yunyun help Cecily sabotage some nominees, she asks them to follow her to several inns. After visiting an inn, Megumin is baffled by Devil King’s forces when they put slime mix into the hot springs. They arrive at the area where the spring water from the mountains is collected. Cecily confirms the Axis Order runs this area while Yunyun reminds her this is where the strange occurrences involving Father Zesta began. Megumin says it’s best to search the location for evidence to see if Zesta is guilty of his crimes.  A group of knights arrive and tell the girls they’ve collected the jelly slime to mix evidence and confirm Father Zesta was carrying a bag of this stuff around. Megumin questions the men and argues Father Zesta wouldn’t do something as ridiculous as this. However, the men believe he’s guilty due to the stories they’ve heard about him and the Axis Sect. As they walk away from the location, Yunyun reminds everyone that Father Zesta might receive the death penalty for his actions.  Suddenly, they hear Father Zesta arguing against his charges. The girls meet Zesta as he’s arguing with the lady who arrested him. Zesta tells the girls he’s been released as the woman beside him apologizes. Zesta asks the woman to give the woman with glasses his thanks for clearing his name with the lie-detecting magic device. Megumin wonders who poured the powder into the springs if it wasn’t Father Zesta. Arnes bump into Megumin and company and still wants to take Chomuske from them.  Arnes and Father Zesta engage in combat. Zesta’s upset because he values Arnes’s dashing appearance but knows the Axis Order doesn’t take kindly to demonic entities. Cecily and other members of the cult stand by Zesta’s side. They believe Arnes is responsible for the inn’s hot springs sabotage incident. Arnes flee after being hunted down by the Axis Cult, even though she didn’t do it. Megumin and Yunyun leave and no longer want anything to do with the Axis Cult. Megumin tells Yunyun she plans to visit the town of Axel to meet someone. Yunyun says she’s heading to Axel because she wants to start training against weak monsters.  Father Zesta returns from his Arnes unsuccessful Arnes hunt. He presents Megumin with cash she can use to embark on her trip to Axel. He feels her recruitment tricks will come in handy down the line, so he’s paying her for her services. Father Zesta tells Megumin to stay one more night in Arcanretia since there are many members of the Axis Cult who’d like to give her their regards. Megumin visits the hot springs with Cecily, and she confirms Father Zesta committed the crime. He mixed the baking soda with the slime mix when he was cleaning up. She tells Megumin not to tell anyone about this.  Cecily explains why the hot springs look the way they are and wishes the rings were wider. Megumin uses explosion magic to make the hot springs more expansive. Father Zesta thanks Megumin for her help with the hot springs and asks her to take a trip here in the future. Megumin says she’d like to stop by Arcanretia with her future allies. Father Zesta casts Aqua’s divine protection spell on Megumin, and Yunyun asks if he could do the same for her. He refuses because her letter got him in trouble.  Cecily hands Megumin some Axis Cult recruitment applications to hand out to Axel’s residents. Megumin throws them at Cecily. Megumin and Yunyun head on the coach for Axel. The episode closes with Megumin vowing to make Axel her base of operations and a place where she’ll recruit her future allies.  The Episode Review  Konosuba: An Explosion On This Wonderful World delivers another fine episode this week. It had some decent humor and gave us answers concerning Father Zesta’s imprisonment. For the most part, not much happens outside of Megumin receiving enough money to travel to Axel to meet the woman who inspired her to pursue Explosion Magic.  It’s touching seeing Yunyun tag along with Megumin in her endeavors, though. It gives the series more opportunities to build upon her relationship with Megumin. Hopefully, it’ll address why Megumin goes on to treat her poorly in the mainline series. Arnes cropping up in the anime again will give viewers hope that the character may receive more development, unlike the students at the magic academy.  The whole fiasco with Father Zesta could’ve been handled better. For instance, if he committed the act, why wasn’t the lie-detecting magic device able to work on him? It leaves a gaping plot hole that may bug a few viewers. Overall, this was an okay chapter of Konosuba: An Explosion On This Wonderful World. I’m sure many viewers are thankful that we can move on to a different location. Hopefully, Megumin and Yunyun’s endeavors here will be more entertaining and less weird than their time spent in Arcanretia.

"explosion","2023-04-03","Not Discerned","{""Seattle"", ""Washington"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-24T13:27:04","As homeless encampments from Seattle, Washington to Portland, Maine continue to grow - public safety concerns are mounting.  In Seattle Tuesday, an RV caught fire on a road littered with trailers, tents and people's belongings.  A startling video captured by witnesses .  While no one was hurt according to fire officials, the explosion was one of many safety concerns the city continues to address as camps grow, despite efforts to disband them.  Posted on RVs parked on the street, orange tickets read the city will be towing and removing any tents, vehicles, or belongings that remain on the road come May 25.          KOMO News reached out to the Mayor's Office and other city leaders to see what is being done to prevent RV encampments from spreading and growing.    Council member Dan Strauss, who represents District 6, sent KOMO News a statement that said they've been working with the city, small businesses and residents.  ""Partnering with Mayor Harrell, my office has helped expand our citywide homelessness response to having neighborhood-based homelessness response teams to draw down encampments by getting people inside rather than pushing people around the community,"" the statement said.      ""I have already spoken to Deputy Mayor Washington about this incident and will continue working with the Mayor to address homelessness in District 6.""    According to the city's , Ballard has one of the highest concentrations of RV encampments in the city. Duwamish/SODO tops the list at 158 encampments as of March, while Ballard has 49.    The chart counts both tents and RVs found in city encampments. `  Navid Paydavosi lives in the Crown Hill neighborhood. He witnessed the fire and has calling on city officials to ""permanently address unauthorized RV encampments.""    In his neighborhood, located near 8th Avenue NW and Holman Rd NW, Paydavosi says the RV encampments have caused significant disruptions and hazards for the residents.  ""Sidewalks have become impassable due to the presence of these vehicles, forcing pedestrians, including students and the elderly, to walk on the streets, putting their safety at risk,"" he writes.  ""Other safety hazards encompass a range of concerns, such as the existence of numerous propane tanks, generators running continuously on sidewalks, and the storage of gasoline containers intended for these generators.""  ALSO |  More than 3-thousand miles away on the opposite coast, .  , another shows up nearby.  ""I'm not used to this,"" Chrissy Russel said. ""I've always had a place to live.""  Russel, who says she's been experiencing homelessness for a little more than a year, was one of the first to set up camp along the city's Bayside Trail near Trader Joe's. What started as just a few tents expanded into a small community of the unhoused only a month or so later.  ""All of a sudden I woke up one morning and there were tons of tents over there around me,"" Russel said. ""We've been trying to keep it, you know, as clean as possible but when you've got all these people in one spot it's hard.""    Last week, the city forced those camping along the trail to leave after the site became a ""health and public safety issue.""  RELATED |  ""Shelters are at capacity, there's nowhere for people to stay and so it turns into campsites,"" Portland Police Major Jason King said. ""It just puts a strain on resources.""    According to data obtained by WGME, calls for service along the Bayside Trail went from 39 in April 2022 to 150 in April 2023, a 280% increase. While some of those calls included crimes like weapons violations, mental health issues or substance use disorder concerns were also on the list.  ""This year on the Bayside Trail alone we've had 25 overdoses, three of them were fatal,"" King said. ""It's a problem generating a lot of calls in the community, and we need to go try to find help for that person.""  Right now, Portland is helping to house more than 1,100 homeless and asylum seekers at a cost of more than $40 million. However, hundreds more remain unhouse and in need of city services that are already stretched thin.  ""The need has grown, and I don't think it's getting any better,"" Bill Burns, the Substance Use Disorder Liaison with Portland Police's Behavioral Health Unit, said. ""From last year to this year, our numbers have increased 136 percent. So that's an average of four new people who are in crisis who reached out to the Portland Police Department every day.""    The Behavioral Health Unit is a ""co-responder"" program which includes specially trained teams of clinicians who respond to ""low level"" calls that involve mental health concerns and substance use.  The unit's unique contacts with individuals went from 304 in May of 2022 to 711 in 2023. Those are calls and connections that are diverted away from uniformed police officers, helping to free up resources in an already understaffed department.  ""One person we got connected to resources, his calls for service went down 84 percent and another guy had 11 calls for service in October, then in April he had zero,"" Burns said. ""We want to leave people better off than they were when they first encountered us.""  Part of that work is connecting the people they respond to with services to get them into more stable situations in the long-term. It is work that's only become harder as those services reach capacity.  WGME I-Team Reporter Dan Lampariello: ""Where do you see your work evolving to handle that increase?""  Burns: ""I think we're going to do everything we can do to meet human needs as they come up. There are a lot of smart people in this community working on a solution to homelessness and let's hope those are successful.""  According to data from the National Alliance to End Homelessness, Maine has seen a 165% increase in its unsheltered homeless population since 2007.  ""Homelessness is bad for everybody,"" National Alliance to End Homelessness Chief Policy Officer Steve Berg said. ""Being homeless and particularly being homeless and being unsheltered is extremely unsafe.""  Those health and safety concerns, Berg says, not only fall on first responders to handle but hospitals as well.  ""They end up bearing the costs and in a small community that kind of cost for the local hospital can be devastating,"" Berg said.  Maine Medical Center in Portland says it doesn't currently track how many people experiencing homelessness seek treatment in its emergency department each year, but across the country, experts say those visits are rising.  Lampariello: ""As a city and a state that continues to see its homeless population grow, what is the solution here?""  Berg: ""I mean, I think the solution is actually pretty well established. If you instead spend money on getting people a house, getting people who can come to their homes and help them with services and with mental health treatment, that can save money in other ways.""  The savings could also help save lives.  ""That's what we're set up to do, to make sure whatever problem is happening doesn't get worse,"" Burns said.  While the PPD Behavioral Health Unit's contacts are still trending well ahead of last year, those involved are still finding success with connecting those in crisis with the help they need.  The five-member unit is also hoping to expand and add three more clinicians to the team.  ""He's [Bill] always been out here for one meaning and that's to help us,"" Russel said. ""I feel like he's always helped.""  Russel says she's thankful, even though she doesn't know where she'll end up next.  ""It's overwhelming,"" Russel said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwQFodHRwczovL2tocWEuY29tL25ld3MvbmF0aW9uLXdvcmxkL2hvbWVsZXNzLWVuY2FtcG1lbnRzLWdyb3ctYWNyb3NzLWNvdW50cnktc2FmZXR5LWNvbmNlcm5zLXJ2LWV4cGxvc2lvbi1wb3B1bGF0aW9uLXVuaG91c2VkLWNyaXNpcy1yZXNvdXJjZXMtbG93LXRlbnRzLWhvdXNpbmctc2VhdHRsZS13YXNoaW5ndG9uLXBvcnRsYW5kLW1haW5l0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"explosion","2023-05-23","Not Discerned","{""LosAngeles"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-24T07:28:38","(L-R): FAST channel panelists Laura Florence of Chicken Soup for the Soul, Nik Mehta of BBC Studios, Scott Olechowski of Plex, Erick Opeka of Cineverse and Katherine Pond of Vizio. (Media Play News staff photo)  OTT.X Panelists Discuss Explosion of FAST Channels  Stephanie Prange  Speakers agreed that the number of FAST (free ad-supported streaming) channels is exploding in the streaming marketplace during presentations at the OTT.X XFronts event May 23 at the Skirball Center in Los Angeles.  “Growth is coming in ad-supported,” said ComScore’s James Muldrow. “The ad-free experience has really plateaued in terms of hours viewed per household.”  FAST revenue is expected to triple from $4 billion to $12 billion in next five years, noted Amagi’s Siva Natarajan.  Indeed, BB Media speaker Tomas Gennari noted there are about 3,000 FAST channels globally, with much of them in the United States.  What to do to monetize those channels and differentiate them from the crowd was the subject of various presentations during the event — and data is key, speakers said.  “When it comes to our data, we have the opportunity to work with our partners to understand what is working,” said Katherine Pond, group VP, platform content and partnerships at Vizio, which through its connected TVs has a bird’s eye view of the marketplace. Vizio, she noted, has one of the top free streaming platforms in the marketplace with WatchFree+.  “WatchFree+ has over 260 free ad supported streaming channels and over 6,000 on-demand assets,” she noted. “It’s the no. 1 fastest growing ad-supported entirely free app on the platform.”  Laura Florence, SVP and GM, digital, at Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment, noted the diversity of monetization opportunities at her company.  “The unique thing about all the different acquired companies under the Chicken Soup brand that we represent now is we have production studios, we have a distribution studio and then we have three different platforms that have clear lines of sight on what they represent,” she said.  With the Redbox kiosks (part of the Chicken Soup company), she noted, new release movies is what drives content. So, for instance, if The Super Mario Bros. Movie is the new release Redbox is offering, the company can promote other animated kids shows on AVOD or other streaming channels at the company. The company also creates originals, for instance through Crackle, that can be distributed via other parties first “to monetize the lifecycle of the content.”  Nik Mehta, of BBC Studios, touted the diverse programming under the BBC brand.  “We’re very excited about the future of FAST,” he said. “We do see a lot of opportunities on the content side. … We have the opportunity with our channels to bring content that has never been seen in the U.S. before.”  The BBC has a FAST channel called Britbox Mysteries for British crime show buffs, but there’s much more in the BBC lineup.  “We consider three buckets,” he said. “Supporting the direct-to-consumer offering like Britbox. We also have another bucket of single IP channels, so single series like ‘Top Gear,’ classic ‘Dr. Who,’ we have an ‘Impossible Quiz’ show, just really diverse brands within that single-series IP bucket and then a third bucket of genre channels where it’s across titles. We have a channel, BBC Earth … We are able to use the fact that it is across different titles to create more stickiness, to create more brand awareness of all the different IP that we have.”  The company tries to use its diverse programming to suit different platforms, he said.  Plex, one of those platforms, is a gatekeeper of sorts in distributing the explosion of streaming options.  “Being able to aggregate all this stuff and being independent — you know we’re not a studio, we’re not producing originals — makes it a safe place for our content partners and for our users because you know when we’re recommending something, it’s a genuine recommendation targeted at them not just to promote what we’re promoting,” said Plex’s Scott Olechowski. “We’re trying to aggregate as much as we can afford.”  “We view as our job to provide the best experience to connect people efficiently to what they love,” he said.  Erick Opeka, newly named president of the newly named Cineverse (previously Cinedigm), noted that there is just a small portion of content available via the top streaming platforms. The streaming industry is “walling off choice,” he said. Cineverse’s plan is to offer a greater expanse of content.  “We added 9,000 titles in March for example,” he said. The plan is to make that growing library more accessible and discoverable.  Vizio’s Pond stresses that partnerships are as important as content.  “Many many other platforms in the market are just looking for content; we’re looking for partnerships,” she said, adding the key is targeting the right customer at the right time with the right ads for better “personalization.”  Florence added there’s “so much room for improvement” in FAST channel execution. “Different things work on different platforms,” she said.  BBC’s Mehta noted that, even with single IP channels, there’s room for programming choices.

The Blue Jays pounded out 27 hits on Tuesday to defeat the Rays 20-1, gaining a split of the first two games of the four-game series.  “It got a little ugly,” Rays manager Kevin Cash said.  George Springer finished 4-for-5 with a solo home run, a triple, two RBIs and three runs.  “It’s good to see some positives on our side,” Springer said. “It’s just a good day. Hopefully spiral into a lot more.”  The Blue Jays scored nine runs and had three home runs in the ninth inning — including a grand slam by Vladimir Guerrero Jr. that gave him six RBIs for the game — against two position players. Luke Raley moved from first base in the eighth to pitch 1 2/3 innings, and catcher Christian Bethancourt pitched one-third of an inning.  “It’s not my favorite place to be,” Raley said. “I told them before, I got rocked in high school, so I can’t imagine what these guys would actually do to me if I tried to pitch. So just try to lob it over the plate and save our bullpen.”  The 19-run margin of defeat was the largest in franchise history. The worst had been a 22-4 defeat to the Boston Red Sox on July 23, 2002.  The Blue Jays are scheduled to start left-hander Yusei Kikuchi (5-1, 4.08 ERA) on Wednesday. In six career games, five starts, against the Rays, he is 4-0 with a 1.80 ERA.  Left-hander Shane McClanahan (7-0, 2.05 ERA) is slated to start for the Rays. In seven career starts against Toronto, McClanahan is 3-2 with a 2.65 ERA.  The Blue Jays broke out on Tuesday after they had lost seven or their previous eight games, including six losses in the final seven games of a 4-6 homestand.  Toronto center fielder Kevin Kiermaier is making his first visit to where he played 10 years for the Rays. The Blue Jays won two of three from the Rays in Toronto last month.  “I told (the Rays) last year when they didn’t sign me, I said, ‘I’ll make you guys miss me next year. Whether you admit it or not, I’m going to make you guys miss me,’ ” Kiermaier said. “So who knows if they do or not; they’re doing just fine without me, so. …”  Kiermaier is 2-for-8 with one RBI in the first two games of the series.  Rays right-hander Tyler Glasnow (left oblique strain) is set to be activated Saturday and pitch for the first time this season. It is a boost for a rotation that has lost Jeffrey Springs (Tommy John surgery) and Drew Rasmussen (flexor strain) to long-term issues.  “Regardless of the injuries, I think having Tyler Glasnow back no matter what is important,” McClanahan said. “The guy’s been busting his butt to get back as soon as he can. We’re excited to see what he can do for us and what we know he can do for us.”  Toronto right-hander Adam Cimber (right rhomboid strain) was reinstated from the injured list on Tuesday and pitched a scoreless ninth inning. Infielder Ernie Clement was promoted to the major league roster. Right-hander Thomas Hatch and infielder Otto Lopez were optioned to Triple-A Buffalo, and right-hander Mitch White (right elbow inflammation/right shoulder fatigue) was transferred to the 60-day IL.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpbmR5c3Nwb3J0cy5jb20vbWxiL2FydGljbGUvaGVhZGxpbmUvamF5cy1haW0tZm9yLWVuY29yZS1hZnRlci0yMC1ydW4tZXhwbG9zaW9uLXZzLXJheXMvNTUwMTAy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Ti Gong  The Modern Art Museum Shanghai is collaborating with Memphis Milano and Global Design Distribution for Christoph Radl's curated exhibition ""Memphis Again: 1981-1985, Stuck Inside the Revolution.""  It is exhibiting nearly 200 pieces of furniture and objects, such as bookshelves, dividers, vitrines, toilet furniture, tables, desks, chairs, lamps, sofa beds, chandeliers, ashtrays, flower pots, and fruit bowls, made from the widest range of materials between 1981 and 1985 for the Memphis collection.  These materials include wood, plastic, laminate, glass, ceramic, porcelain, metal and fabric.  The Memphis Design Style is the brainchild of Ettore Sottsass, who started the movement from his living room in Milan in 1980. The Italian architect gathered a group of artists, architects and designers, who shared a distaste for the modernist, minimalist style and its use of restrained shapes, subdued hues, and modest lines.  As the artists brainstormed to create a new identity, Sottsass kept playing Bob Dylan's ""Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again"" continuously. The group of Italian artists opposed to the harmonized post-war aesthetic standards adopted the moniker ""Memphis.""  The Memphis group used terrazzo and plastic laminate materials in their creations, and they were known for their ephemeral designs with shockingly bright colors and abstract embellishment as well as geometrical shapes.  Ti Gong  Ti Gong  Memphis Again made its China debut in Shanghai with the backing of the Istituto Italiano di Cultura di Shanghai after debuting at La Triennale Museum in Milan during design week 2022.  ""The exhibition is presented with two key metaphors in mind: a fashion show and the nightclubbing scene of the 1980s,"" said Radl, the curator. ""It was clear to us from the beginning that we did not want a historicized exhibition, nor an exhibition that was an homage, but rather an immersion into a colorful world full of strong, sometimes provocative expressions that are as vital today as they were back then.""  Memphis Again spans two floors, beginning on the second floor, where all Memphis textiles guide people through the show for a more theatrical effect.  Italian multidisciplinary artist and illustrator Massimo Giacon has developed large-scale comic strips with animations that highlight the brand's history. Giacon's work takes viewers back in time to Memphis's inaugural show in 1981 and Sottsass's nighttime gathering.  On the top floor, the objects are displayed in chronological order alongside the spacious U-shaped room, like a fashion show where viewers walk the catwalk in a space that, thanks to the furniture and a special soundtrack by American DJ and producer Seth Troxler, feels like a nightclub.  Memphis's black-and-white patterns create a dreamy and amusing background for a series of neighboring rooms in the exhibition space. Memphis's larger pieces and a variety of objects are on display here.

A suborbital rocket is one that reaches space but doesn’t have the speed to stay in orbit for a long time. Of a total of 117 payloads, which are student projects that were selected as part of the challenge, 13 were on the ill-fated rocket.  “It's pretty upsetting [and] really stinks that like given the nature of it, it's not possible to try again,” said Logan Wynia, a graduate of Newcastle High School that participated in the TechRise program. “But I'm focused on what, like where my future is headed, so, got to keep going, I guess.”  The TechRise Student Challenge encourages students in 6th through 12th grades to design science experiments that will be placed on suborbital vehicles. Newcastle High School students created small computer microprocessors placed in a 4x8x8 inch box that would determine if cosmic radiation would scramble code entered by the students into the microprocessors. It was meant to show how radiation can affect computers.  Those satellites were picked out of many projects to be part of the challenge. They were loaded in the 20-foot tall rocket launched at a facility near Upham, New Mexico on May 1.  Wynia and several other students have also since graduated since working on their TechRise project in the spring of 2022. He heard about the explosion via an email chain from other members of the team that worked on the project and that viewed a livestream of the launch.  “[What] I did was some of the programming, and I learned to solder for this project,” he said. “Earlier that year [we] did a project requiring a geiger counter. So we used the same code for that geiger counter project, [and] kind of recycled it and made it fit with what we needed for the TechRise project.”  Despite the explosion, Wynia is undeterred in his future plans to pursue a STEM career and hopes to eventually to become an astronaut.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3d3dy53eW9taW5ncHVibGljbWVkaWEub3JnL2VkdWNhdGlvbi8yMDIzLTA1LTI0L2Etcm9ja2V0LXRoYXQtZXhwbG9kZWQtY2FycmllZC1hLXNwYWNlLXJlc2VhcmNoLWV4cGVyaW1lbnQtY3JlYXRlZC1ieS1uZXdjYXN0bGUtaGlnaC1zY2hvb2wtc3R1ZGVudHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Experts say we should expect the increase in bugs to last longer than usual.  RIVERSIDE, Calif. (KABC) -- It's something a lot of people have noticed around Southern California lately: bugs.  Bugs, bugs and more bugs, everywhere you look.  ""Every time I go out in the backyard, especially when it's sunny, it's always these little things coming at me,"" said Frankie Munoz, who lives in Riverside.  It's not just nuisance bugs and gnats but it's also mosquitoes and bees. It all adding up to a busy season so far for pest control experts.  ""I've been real busy,"" said Nick Cappellano, who owns Allied Pest Control. ""I average between 16 and 22 jobs a day, responding to all sorts of things: ants, spiders, ear wigs, which are considered the pincher bugs that end up in the house.""  For those wondering why we're seemingly under attack this spring, experts say look no further than all the record rain we received over the winter.

""All of those increased areas with stagnant water are likely increasing the number of mosquitoes being produced, similarly with other non-biting midges that are produced in aquatic sites,"" he said.  Gerry said we should expect the increase in bugs to last longer than usual.  ""In general, I think this is going to be an unusual year because we have a lot of snowmelt that's going to continue feeding into lakes and ponds and rivers throughout Southern California, much longer than we'd typically have in our state at least,"" he said.  ""I think that's going to extend our mosquito season much longer than we've had in the past.""  The Riverside County Department of Environmental Health said residents need to do their part to protect themselves from mosquitoes.  ""What we really want the public to know is that the fight against mosquitoes requires their help to truly be effective,"" said spokesperson Kristin Lorge. ""Managing standing water is key.

"explosion","2017-09-17","09:30:00","{""Washington"", ""DistrictOfColumbia"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-24T20:00:00","An image of black smoke billowing next to a bureaucratic-looking building spread across social media Monday morning, with the claim that it showed an explosion near the Pentagon.  An image of black smoke billowing next to a bureaucratic-looking building spread across social media Monday morning, with the claim that it showed an explosion near the Pentagon.  The posts sent a brief shiver through the stock market as they were quickly picked up by news outlets outside the U.S., before officials jumped in to clarify that no blast actually took place and the photo was a fake.  Experts say the viral image had telltale signs of an AI-generated forgery, and its popularity underscores the everyday chaos these now increasingly sophisticated and easy-to-access programs can inflict.  Here’s a closer look at the facts.  CLAIM: An image shows an explosion near the Pentagon.  THE FACTS: Police and fire officials in Arlington, Virginia, say the image is not real and there was no incident at the U.S. Department of Defense headquarters across the Potomac from the nation’s capital.  Despite this, the image and claim was spread by outlets including RT, a Russian government-backed media company formerly known as Russia Today. It was also widely shared in investment circles, including an account bearing Twitter's signature blue verification check mark that falsely suggested it was associated with Bloomberg News.  “Reports of an explosion near the Pentagon in Washington DC,” the Russian state news agency wrote in a since-deleted tweet to its more than three million followers.  RT confirmed it took down the tweet and “covered the official position from the Pentagon on the matter” after verifying the reports were inaccurate.  “As with fast-paced news verification, we made the public aware of reports circulating and once provenance and veracity were ascertained, we took appropriate steps to correct the reporting,"" the company wrote in an emailed statement Tuesday.  Still the timing of the fake image, which appeared to spread widely just after the U.S. stock market opened for trading at 9:30 a.m., was enough to send a ripple through the investment world.  The S&P 500 briefly dropped a modest 0.3% as social media accounts and investment websites popular with day traders repeated the false claims.  Other investments also moved in ways that typically occur when fear enters the market. Prices for U.S. Treasury bonds and gold, for example, briefly began to climb, suggesting investors were looking for someplace safer to park their money.  The image's rapid spread prompted the Arlington County Fire Department to take to social media to knock down the rumors.  “@PFPAOfficial and the ACFD are aware of a social media report circulating online about an explosion near the Pentagon,” the agency wrote, referring to the acronym for the Pentagon Force Protection Agency that polices the Pentagon. “There is NO explosion or incident taking place at or near the Pentagon reservation, and there is no immediate danger or hazards to the public.”  Capt. Nate Hiner, a spokesperson for the fire department, confirmed the agency’s tweet was authentic but declined to comment further, deferring to the Pentagon police force, which didn’t respond to email and phone messages.  Misinformation experts say the fake image was likely created using generative artificial intelligence programs, which have allowed increasingly realistic, but oftentimes flawed, visuals to flood the internet recently.  Inconsistencies in the building, fence and surrounding area are imperfections typically found in AI-generated images, noted Hany Farid, a computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who specializes in digital forensics, misinformation and image analysis.  “Specifically, the grass and concrete fade into each other, the fence is irregular, there is a strange black pole that is protruding out of the front of the sidewalk but is also part of the fence,” he wrote in an email. “The windows in the building are inconsistent with photos of the Pentagon that you can find online.”  Chirag Shah, co-director of the Center for Responsibility in AI Systems & Experiences at the University of Washington in Seattle, cautioned that spotting fakes won’t always be as obvious.  Society will need to lean more on “crowdsourcing and community vigilance to weed out bad information and arrive at the truth” as AI technology improves, he argued.  “Simply relying on detection tools or social media posts are not going to be enough,” Shah wrote in an email.  Before the explosion hoax, the biggest Beltway intrigue on Wall Street’s mind Monday morning was whether the U.S. government will avoid a disastrous default on its debt.  But as the market is becoming increasingly reactive to headline-grabbing news, misinformation can be especially damaging when it’s shared by outlets even vaguely deemed as credible, said Adam Kobeissi, editor-in-chief at The Kobeissi Letter, an industry publication.  “A lot of these moves are happening because of high frequency trading, algorithmic trading, which is basically taking headlines, synthesizing them and then breaking them down into a trade on a millisecond basis,” he explained by phone, noting that much of the market is now automated. “It’s basically like you’re pulling a trigger every time a headline comes out.”  __  Associated Press business reporters Stan Choe and Wyatte Grantham-Philips in New York contributed to this story.  ___  This is part of AP’s effort to address widely shared misinformation, including work with outside companies and organizations to add factual context to misleading content that is circulating online.

"explosion","2023-04-12","Not Discerned","{""Saltdal"", ""Nordland"", ""Norway""}","2023-05-24T16:15:00","CHEYENNE, Wyo. (Wyoming News Now) - It sounds like the beginning of a plot to a mystery movie.  About 30 tons of ammonium nitrate fertilizer is still missing after disappearing during a rail trip from Cheyenne to California.  On April 12, a railcar carrying the chemical, used both as a fertilizer and an explosive, left on a two week trek to Saltdale, California. Once it arrived, the railcar was empty.  Officials are early in their investigation but the leading theory is the disappearance resulted from a leak, and there is no indication the material was stolen.  According to a spokesperson from Dyno Nobel, an explosives manufacturer whose plant the railcar departed, it’s believed the chemical leaked in small pellets along the way.  “Every indication is the pellets fell from the rail car onto the tracks in small quantities throughout the long trip.”  Though ammonium nitrate is routinely used as a common fertilizer, it can also be used as an explosive. All it needs is a little fuel.  Historically, there have been at least a half dozen instances where ammonium nitrate was the cause for deadly explosions. Most famously, the chemical was used in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, which killed 168 people.  Most recently, a 2020 explosion in Lebanon killed more than 200 people after ammonium nitrate detonated.  Union Pacific, the company responsible for transporting the railcar, along with Dyno Nobel, both maintained that criminal activity is not suspected.  Both companies also stated if the material leaked, it won’t pose any environmental hazards either.  “The fertilizer is designed for ground application and quick soil absorption. If the loss resulted from a railcar leak over the course of transportation from origin to destination, the release should pose no risk to public health or the environment,” this according to a statement from Union Pacific.  Dyno Nobel also stated that the seals were intact before leaving Cheyenne and after arriving in Saltdale.  According to Dyno Nobel, “The railcar at issue was sealed when it left the Cheyenne facility, and the seals were still intact when it arrived in Saltdale. The railcar was also observed after departure in the railroad’s Cheyenne yard with the seals intact and no sign of any leaks.”  The railcar was transported back to Wyoming for inspection.

"explosion","2023-05-22","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-24T18:28:10","Verified accounts on Twitter may have contributed to the viral spread of a false claim that an explosion was unfolding at the Pentagon.  Around 8:42 AM on Monday, a verified account on Twitter, labeling itself as a media and news organization, shared a fake image of smoke billowing near a white building they said was the Pentagon. The tweet's caption also misrepresented the Pentagon's location.  No such incident took place, the Arlington County Fire Department later said on Twitter. The Pentagon, the headquarters building of the U.S. Department of Defense, is located in Arlington County, Virginia.  A Pentagon spokesperson also told ABC News that no explosion had occurred.  But throughout the morning, the fake image and misleading caption picked up steam on Twitter. Cyabra, a social analysis firm, analyzed the online conversation and found that roughly 3,785 accounts had mentioned the falsehoods, dozens of these were verified.  ""The checkmark may well have contributed to giving the account the appearance of authenticity, which would have helped it with achieved virality,"" Jules Gross, a solutions engineer at Cyabra, told ABC News.  Some of these accounts were verified, but they didn't appear to be coordinated, according to Cyabra.  ""The bad news is that it appears that just a single account was able to achieve virality and cause maximum chaos,"" Gross added.  While ABC News has not been able to determine the source of the content, nor confirm that the original tweet was the 8:42 tweet, the image contains many hallmarks of being generated using a text-to-image AI tool.  There are many visual inconsistencies in the image, including a streetlamp that appears to be both in front and behind the metal barrier. Not to mention that the building itself doesn't look like the Pentagon.  Text-to-image tools powered by artificial intelligence allow users to input a natural language description, called a prompt, to get an image in return.  In the last few months, these tools have become increasingly sophisticated and accessible, leading to an explosion of hyperrealistic content fooling users online.  The original false tweet was eventually deleted, but not before it was amplified by a number of accounts on Twitter bearing the blue check that was once reserved for verified accounts, but which can now be purchased by any user.  ABC News could not immediately reach a spokesperson for Twitter to request comment.  What are the solutions?  ""Today's AI hoax of the Pentagon is a harbinger of what is to come,"" explained Truepic CEO Jeff McGregor, who says his company's technology can add a layer of transparency to content posted online.  Truepic, a founding member of the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity, has developed a camera technology that captures, signs, and seals critical details in every photo and video, such as time, date, and location.  The company also created tools that would allow users to hover over a piece of AI-generated content to find out how it was fabricated. In April, they published the first ""transparent deepfake"" to showcase how the technology works.  While some companies have adopted the C2PA technology, it's now up to social media platforms to make that information available to their users.  ""This is an open-source technology that lets everyone attach metadata to their images to show that they created an image, when and where it was created, and what changes were made to it along the way,"" Dana Rao, general counsel and chief trust officer at Adobe, told ABC News. ""This allows people to prove what's real.""  Alterations would be identified. For example, if an image was cropped or filtered, that information could be displayed, but the user would also be able to select how much data they make available to the public.  Both state and local law enforcement were provided a written briefing Monday by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, an organization dedicated to countering extremism, hate and disinformation, with details on the incident.  ""Security and law enforcement officials are increasingly concerned there's an increased concern in AI-generated information operations intended to undermine credibility in government, stoke fear or even incite violence,"" said John Cohen, an ABC News contributor and former acting undersecretary for intelligence.  ""Digital content provenance will help mitigate these events by scaling transparency and authenticity in visual content by empowering users and creators,"" added McGregor.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vYWJjN255LmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L2hvdy12ZXJpZmllZC1hY2NvdW50cy1tYWRlLWZha2UtaW1hZ2VzLW9mLXBlbnRhZ29uLWV4cGxvc2lvbi1nby12aXJhbC8xMzI5MDkwMy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

When they responded to an outage at the customer’s home, our crews found that a third party working in the area had damaged OG&E equipment.” Oklahoma Gas & Electric  ORIGINAL:  Dana Simpson returned to her Chandler home after a day of work on May 9th to find half her kitchen had burned and her stovetop had exploded.  “It was a power surge,” said Simpson.  She says OG&E shuts off power to her neighborhood near Forest Drive weekly, if not daily. Several other neighbors agreed, saying that it happens quite often.  “They shut it off and then we have to wait for it to turn back on, it’s a headache,” said Simpson.  She said what happened to her was going to happen eventually to someone in their neighborhood, “it’s only a matter of time.”  The damage took out her stovetop oven, and the microwave and burned many parts of the counter around the kitchen.  “You don’t realize how much you use a stovetop and a microwave until you’ve lost them,” said Simpson. “When I opened the door that day my house was full of smoke and it smelled like something electrical had burned. I went into the kitchen to find the stovetop had blown up, there were things shot across the kitchen. It was disastrous.”  What’s more, after she filed a claim against OG&E trying to get some of her money back she was denied.  “It’s insane, I didn’t do this,” said Simpson.  Picture from Simpson of the damage to the stovetop.  She waited weeks before she got any sort of response back.

"explosion","2023-05-25","18:00:00","{""Rome"", ""Lazio"", ""Italy""}","2023-05-24T15:00:58","A newly discovered supernova can be watched as it develops in real-time, online and for free.  The supernova, designated SN 2023ixf, is one of the largest and brightest seen for a decade. The exploding star was first spotted in an image taken by experienced supernova hunter Koichi Itagaki, from Yamagata, Japan, on Friday, May 19, 2023. This initial observation was followed up by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) telescopes in California, which confirmed the discovery on Saturday (May 20).  The proximity of SN 2023ixf and the fact that it has been brightening from its initial magnitude has made the supernova a popular target for amateur astronomers with backyard telescopes that can see it as a small speck of light. This new supernova is located in the galaxy Messier 101 (or M101), also known as the Pinwheel Galaxy, home to the asterism known as the Big Dipper, a popular observational target for rookie astronomers.  This particular galaxy and supernova can be difficult to view in the night sky without the right conditions or telescope, however. Luckily, the Virtual Telescope Project will livestream the cosmic explosion on its website and YouTube channel as it develops via its power robotic telescopes based in Rome, Italy. The online event will kick off at 6 p.m. EDT (2200 GMT) on Thursday, May 25.  Related: This new supernova is the closest to Earth in a decade. It's visible in the night sky right now.  Long Island, New York-based astrophotographer Steven Bellavia produced this composite animation of the Pinwheel Galaxy using an image taken on April 21 and comparing it to another image taken on May 21, which clearly shows the supernova appearing.

We recommend the Celestron Astro Fi 102 as the top pick in our best beginner's telescope guide. Don't forget a moon filter!  ""While we discover many supernova candidates every year, having one of them visible through small telescopes is exceptional. SN 2023ixf is one of them, thanks to its distance of just 20 million light-years from us,"" Italian astrophysicist and astronomer and founder of the Virtual Telescope Project, Gianluca Masi, wrote on its website. ""In addition, its host galaxy, the spiral Messier 101, is one of the most beautiful cosmic islands out there, making the vision even more precious and unique.""  Since it explosively burst onto the scene, astronomers have also been studying the supernova with more sophisticated and out-of-this-world equipment, including the Hubble Space Telescope. Space Telescope Live announced on its Twitter feed on Tuesday, May 22, that Hubble was eying the relatively close supernova.  Hubble is looking at the Ext Star SN2023IXF with Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS/CCD) for Mr. Erez Zimmerman. https://t.co/slQjAKMxI1 pic.twitter.com/NnWkjtNhpAMay 22, 2023 See more  If you want to observe the supernova for yourself, Space.com's skywatching columnist Joe Rao offered some advice. ""The Pinwheel Galaxy containing the new supernova is located near the border separating Ursa Major (the Big Bear) from Boötes the Herdsman ,"" Rao said. ""If you locate the Big Dipper, imagine a line extending from two of the stars in the handle, Alioth and Mizar. Continuing that line a similar distance beyond Mizar will place one in the general vicinity of M101. Experienced amateur astronomers who are familiar with observing M101 might see the supernova visually as an out-of-place speck of light in one of the spiral arms.""

According to the officer’s report, a “loud hissing” noise was heard, and then witnesses believed it to be propane gas spraying in the air creating what appeared to be “white smoke.” The officer said a large explosion then occurred. The officer immediately radioed for assistance and began to render aid to the victims.  Injured in this incident were a 58-year-old White Lake, NC woman, a 49-year-old Riegelwood, NC man, and the man’s dog.  The following agencies responded to the incident: White Lake Police Department, White Lake Fire Department, Bladen County Sheriff’s Office, Bladen County Emergency Medical Services, Bladen County Fire Marshalls Office, and Cape Fear Valley Life Link.  The 58-year-old White Lake woman was transported via Cape Fear Valley Life Link Helicopter to an undisclosed hospital for her injuries. No information is available on her condition at this time.  The 49-year-old Riegelwood man and his dog were treated for injuries and released.  According to the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission, propane gas is highly flammable. About 600 fires or explosions occur with gas tanks yearly, injuring about 30 people. The new safety standard for propane gas tanks requires that an “over-fill prevention device” be installed in new gas tanks.  Four safety tips the commission offers for propane gas safety are listed below.  – Always keep propane gas containers upright.  – Never keep a filled container in a hot car or car trunk. Heat will cause the gas pressure to increase, which may open the relief valve and allow gas to escape.  – Never bring the propane tank into the house.  – Older gas containers may need to be traded for new containers offering better “over-fill prevention.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vYmxhZGVub25saW5lLmNvbS9lbXBsb3llZS1jdXN0b21lci1hbmQtZG9nLXN1ZmZlci1zZXJpb3VzLWluanVyaWVzLWluLXByb3BhbmUtZXhwbG9zaW9uLTQtdGlwcy1mb3ItcHJvcGFuZS1zYWZldHkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"explosion","2019-02-09","19:30:00","{""SanFrancisco"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-24T21:46:17","(KRON) — A couple whose home was destroyed after their neighbor’s residence exploded in the Outer Sunset District has filed a lawsuit against the owners of the residence.  David Garth and his wife Nang Phommavongsay lived next door to the home that exploded in February. They say their home was ruined and their lives forever changed by the traumatic explosion which “leveled the home to its foundation.”  Darron Price, 53, was arrested after the explosion on suspicion of manufacturing drugs at the residence at 1734 22nd Avenue. He also is facing felony manslaughter charges after a woman’s body was found in the rubble. The woman was later determined to be his wife, 51-year-old Rita Price. Rita Price’s caretaker, Lisa, was left with severe burns after the explosion. Fire investigators later determined that the fire originated after ignitable vapors came into contact with the starting sequence of the dryer.  Investigators at the scene found butane tanks and other tools related to producing hash oil, the San Francisco District Attorney’s Office said. Price, who has dual citizenship in Australia and the U.S., was released on home detention in Feburary.  The complaint, filed in San Francisco County Superior Court, alleges that when Price moved in at 1734 22nd Ave. back in 2021 that the, “Defendants were aware or should have been aware that he had filled the basement of the home with large butane tanks used for these illegal purposes.”  Court documents detail the terrifying moments the couple faced in the wake of the explosion. On the morning of Feb. 9, Garth dropped his wife off at work and his daughter off at school before heading to Oakland. He saw an explosion happened in the Outer Sunset, but initially assumed it was connected to a different home.  KRON On is streaming now  That’s when Phommavongsay called him; she was crying because their home was on fire. The court filing says most of the family’s belongings were completely incinerated in the blaze.  The defendants are identified in court documents as Peter De Martini and Diane De Martini. The De Martinis live nearby to the residence, and the court filing alleges they often walked by to check in and talk with Price.  Inside of 1730 22nd Street after the February explosion (Photo courtesy of SF court filing)  “The behavior exhibited by the Defendants is nothing short of shocking. Allowing a tenant to operate a highly dangerous drug lab in your garage is a ticking time bomb. Their neighbors David and Nang are lucky to be alive, and their lives are forever marked by this tragic event. They were left with nothing,” the couple’s attorney, David Hollenberg of Cotchett, Pitre & McCarthy, said.  “Seeing our life completely turn upside down like that is something I don’t know we can ever recover from. It’s still hard to sleep even months later.” — Nang Phommavongsay  The Garth Phommavongsay family did not specify the amount they are asking for in damages. However, the court documents lists medical expenses, past and future loss of earning as well as general and punitive damages to be considered by the court.  The initial incident report provided by the San Francisco Fire Department details some of the damages connected to the explosion. An estimated $5.5 million dollars in property damage occurred on the street after the explosion, and an additional $2.3 million in personal property was also damaged. An estimated 15 homes faced various levels of damage after the fire.  Local leaders held a town hall to address neighbors after the explosion rocked the area. Community members told KRON4 they couldn’t believe this incident happened.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmtyb240LmNvbS9uZXdzL2JheS1hcmVhL25laWdoYm9ycy1zdWUtcHJvcGVydHktb3duZXJzLWFmdGVyLWZhdGFsLW91dGVyLXN1bnNldC1leHBsb3Npb24v0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cua3JvbjQuY29tL25ld3MvYmF5LWFyZWEvbmVpZ2hib3JzLXN1ZS1wcm9wZXJ0eS1vd25lcnMtYWZ0ZXItZmF0YWwtb3V0ZXItc3Vuc2V0LWV4cGxvc2lvbi9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"explosion","2023-12-05","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-24T04:49:44","Two brave Powhatan Point Elementary students got a visit from some local superheroes Tuesday.  Alan and Arthur Curtis, who were injured in an explosion and house fire in August and are going through a long recovery, joined the team when their school received a visit Tuesday from the Friendly Valley-Wide Spider-Man of the Valley Avengers, with “Tony Stark” driving him to the site. Students cheered and swarmed the wall-crawler with questions and requests for autographs.  Their teachers in second and third grades, Krista Hunt and Leslye Fetty, said the brothers have made impressive progress since returning to school around November.  “They came back and made great strides,” Hunt said. “To work through everything that they’ve been through, they’ve done a wonderful job and are excited to come to school each day and can’t wait to see their friends.”  Their mother, Alice Curtis, was present and spoke about their recovery.  “They spent almost three months of time in the hospital because they had severe burns around their bodies’ surface,” she said. “Both had third-degree burns. Alan, my older boy, he had 49 percent of his body burned. My younger one, he had 21 percent.”  She said the three-month hospitalization was followed by physical therapy and counseling.  “I encouraged them to come back to school because of the teacher they know, the classmates they play with. They just miss them so much,” Alice Curtis said, adding that the school also has physical therapy and provides valuable encouragement.  She said despite their severe injuries, their biggest challenge was losing their father, Arnold Curtis, who died as a result of the same accident.  “They were really tied to him,” she said. “They seem to get a little bit better, talking about what happened. In this moment, we’re still not able to say what exactly caused the explosion because we still don’t know.”  She added that the superheroes’ visit meant a lot to her sons.  “They’re always superhero fans, big fans,” she said, adding that the pair have been living up to superhero standards. “I think so. I don’t think a lot of people, even adults like us, can do so much as they are doing.”  Principal Rob Caldwell said hearing about the accident was a shock to the close-knit school.  “It was last summer. We had no kids here and we heard a bunch of sirens going up the creek,” he said. “We saw the house ablaze.”  He said the boys returned to class in late fall or early winter and the other students were happy to greet them.  “They’re close-knit. This is a small school,” he said. “As we returned to school, the two boys were still going back and forth, here to Akron and the burn unit, but they came back for a visit for a day or so. We had everybody in the gym to kind of surprise them when they walked in. Everybody was hugging them,” he said. “They’ve adjusted tremendously, and for all the schooling that the’ve lost, they’ve recovered. They’ve done really well academically. They’re on top of things, and that’s a credit to their mom.”  Stark, who also goes by his day-to-day identity of Tom Wensyel, said the Avengers often visit children who are battling illness and recovering from accidents. They recently paid a call to a child recovering from open-heart surgery.  “That’s our main goal. We show up and they get to meet the superheroes,” he said, adding the costumed characters lend encouragement. “To face what they’re going through, and Spider-Man just seems to bring out the best in everybody.”  He said the Valley Avengers are often awed by the courage of the children they visit.  “We have learned something very important: the power of a child. Their willpower, their strength, their soul can’t be overcome. You can’t beat the heart of a child, and if we all accept a little bit of the heart of a child within us, it would be a whole different world.”  Your Friendly Valley-Wide Spider-Man and the Valley Avengers can be found on Facebook.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWludGVsbGlnZW5jZXIubmV0L25ld3MvY29tbXVuaXR5LzIwMjMvMDUvcG93aGF0YW4tcG9pbnQteW91dGgtZ2V0LXZpc2l0LWZyb20tdmFsbGV5LWF2ZW5nZXJzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

With a recent breakout and retest above the $0.44 zone, coupled with a breakthrough above the 50-day exponential moving average, an inverse head and shoulders (H&S) pattern has emerged, suggesting possible upward movement in the XRP price.  Source: TradingView  These indicators hold significance on their own, but their convergence points towards an imminent surge in XRP's value. However, given the current market uncertainty and the lingering legal dispute between Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the formation of such bullish structures raises questions and curiosity among market participants. Could insiders and market makers be pricing in significant news that could justify a potential rise?  The last time an event of a similar magnitude occurred was in March, when investors were also betting on an imminent verdict in the SEC case against Ripple. There was particular enthusiasm from Korean investors at the time, with XRP trading volumes on key South Korean exchanges accounting for more than 30% of total turnover.  This time, however, the conjuncture is different; trading volumes and volatility have fallen as compared with the beginning of spring, and the market itself is in rather a near-depressive state.

Considered the next big thing on the international circuit, India's fastest bowler was surprisingly reduced to a sporadic role in the 16th edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) at Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH). After Umran shot to fame by bowling the fastest delivery by an Indian pacer in the IPL, the speedster was retained by SRH for ₹4 crore. The express pacer also received his maiden India cap in white-ball cricket during the 2022 season. Even though Umran was tipped to spearhead the pace attack of SRH in IPL 2023, the young fast bowler only recorded eight appearances for the Hyderabad-based franchise. Irfan Pathan challenged Sehwag's explosive verdict on Umran Malik and the ex-India star also praised Rinku Singh (Instagram @Irfan Pathan-PTI-ANI)  ""League's fastest bowler sitting out baffles me. Umran Malik wasn’t handled well by his team,"" is how former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan reflected on Umran's ouster from the SRH playing XI for their home game against Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) earlier this month. While Irfan was vocal about SRH's questionable snubbing of the speed merchant, legendary India opener Virender Sehwag on the contrary, dropped a bomb on the Hyderabad pacer with his fiery statement. The former India skipper castigated Umran for not learning anything from pace ace Dale Steyn at the SRH camp. So what's happening with Umran at SRH? Does Umran really need to work on his line and length to bounce back next season?  ALSO READ: 'Despite working with Steyn for so long...': Sehwag brutally hammers Umran Malik after dismal IPL 2023  Speaking to Hindustan Times in an interview, former India all-rounder Irfan answered the burning question and opined that a fast bowler of Umran's calibre should never compromise his speed. “So first of all. Let's take last year, he was the highest wicket-taker for SRH. Right? And he played for India after that as well. We talking about a guy who bowls 150-plus. And here we are stuck with line and length. If you'll be bowling quick and you're an asset to the national team, that thing comes automatically (line and length). So do you want someone to not bowl quick and concentrate on the line and length or do you want someone to just be quick? So with time, line and length comes automatically,” said Irfan, who is an expert with Star Sports, official TV broadcaster of IPL 2023.  'Umran should never compromise on his speed'  ""I don't think we should be worried about the line and length of someone who bowls quick. Yes, you want that. Yes, it should be in your armoury for sure. You should have something in your armoury to surprise the batter apart from the extra pace. For Umran, adjusting his line and length - It's not the right way for him. He should never compromise on his speed. He should keep bowling fast. Line and length will come, there are a couple of things I have in mind. that I will discuss with him in person,"" the ex-India cricketer continued.  When SRH squared off against Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB), Hyderabad captain Aiden Markram clearly indicated that he has no mandate in the selection process. Markram was clueless when he was asked to reveal why Umran is being overlooked by the SRH think-tank at IPL 2023. With an economy of 10.85, Umran only picked up 5 wickets in 8 matches for SRH this season. Not only Umran, but 2016 winners SRH also recorded a forgetful season by bagging a wooden spoon in the IPL 2023.  ""My advice to Umran is always personal. So it's always been shared. It’s always been spoken to. He has been handled well by NCA as well. There are always conversations between me, the coaches and Umran as well. We have already made a plan about how to move forward with it. But yes, he should have been backed more. They should have been given a longer run. I give you a simple example, Tushar Deshpande. Similar economy, but he is getting games and is taking wickets - look at where he is right now. It’s not about the franchise, it’s about the selectors selecting the playing XI,"" added Irfan, who played 103 matches in the IPL.  'Rinku has been such a big revelation this season'  Acknowledging the rapid rise of Rinku Singh, former India cricketer Pathan also reserved ultimate praise for the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) batter. The 25-year-old emerged as the knight in shining armour for the Eden Garden stalwarts at IPL 2023. Rinku was KKR's leading run-getter (474) in a topsy-turvy season. When asked to pick the standout uncapped player of this season's IPL, Pathan reserved high praise for Rinku and the ex-India all-rounder also gave Rajasthan Royals (RR) opener Yashasvi Jaiswal a special mention.  ""It’s a big competition between Yashasvi Jaiswal and Rinku Singh. But I’ll go with Rinku Singh. Look, I'm really impressed with Yashasvi. Last year he was getting out to spinners and this year, he has smoked them. His strike rate has been outstanding as well. He has actually given a breather to Jos Buttler quite a few times. But Rinku has been such a big revelation this season. He is so calm under pressure and he has done it again and again this season for KKR,"" Pathan pointed out.  ""That one inning against Gujarat Titans (GT), against all odds that he won the game. Last over, hitting 5 sixes. It’s a magical moment. It doesn't happen. We had not seen that kind of moment in the last 15 years. We have seen quite a few matchwinners - Kieron Pollard, Andre Russell, Yusuf Pathan, Ab de Villiers and MS Dhoni. These are the pure matchwinners. But who has done what Rinku did this season? No one. None of them. Rinku has created something that will last long in fans’ minds throughout their lives.

An AI-generated image of an explosion next to what was claimed to be a building in the Pentagon was shared online on Monday, after being released on Twitter by a user posing as news organisation Bloomberg.  As it circulated, the S&P 500 stock exchange fell by about 0.3 per cent, to a session low, before rebounding when it was confirmed fake. RT, the Russian state-controlled TV news channel, tweeted the fake image then deleted the tweet shortly afterwareds.  Henry Ajder, an expert on deepfake images, told i the image was the “first really significant one to essentially spook the markets”.  Prime example of the dangers in the pay-to-verify system: This account, which tweeted a (very likely AI-generated) photo of a (fake) story about an explosion at the Pentagon, looks at first glance like a legit Bloomberg news feed. pic.twitter.com/SThErCln0p — Andy Campbell (@AndyBCampbell) May 22, 2023  Even something that was discovered to be false within a short timeframe could have a damaging impact. In the hands of bad actors, these images could be used to crash the market or make the stock price soar for a favourable return, said Mr Ajder, who presents BBC Radio 4’s The Future Will Be Synthesised.  “Moving forward, it’s just not going to be possible for even well-trained eyes in a lot of cases, from the image alone, to spot a fake.”  The photo was posted by a user under the name of “Bloomberg Feed” – which had a blue tick next to it, meaning the creators paid the required $8 per month to Twitter for a “verified” account.  The real Bloomberg news site actually has a gold tick beside it – which mean it is the official account of a business of other private organisation. However, judging whether an account is genuine would require the public to kow what a gold tick is – calling into question Twitter’s current verification system, Mr Ajder said.  An explosion at the Pentagon would be easy to quickly verify on the ground, but that might not be the case for an explosion for a village in Ukraine, he added, and the rapid creation and increasing sophistication of such images posed a challenge for those looking for news and for journalists seeking to verify events in a fast-paced environment.  “In a world where you can generate any kind of content in a realistic fashion with AI at scale and within minutes, you could create 200 different images of this fire from different perspectives,” said Mr Ajder. “I think it really speaks to how our information infrastructure and media infrastructure is not prepared for this AI-generated content.”  Last week, Open AI chief executive Sam Altman testified before US congress, agreeing with the need for AI regulation and saying, “I think if this technology goes wrong, it can go quite wrong,” The New York Times reported.  Mr Ajder said the current approach to AI risks was not fair as it is focused on how ordinary people ca spot fakes, rather than on demanding regulation from technology companies or spending more money on content moderation. News organisations and technology companies weren’t “prepared” for what might come, he added.  “It’s a perfect storm where traditional news media takes time to verify, the algorithmic nature of platform rewards controversial and sensational content and the platforms don’t have much in the way of strong content moderation to filter out these fakes,” he said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vaW5ld3MuY28udWsvbmV3cy93b3JsZC9mYWtlLXBlbnRhZ29uLWV4cGxvc2lvbi1waG90by1pbmZvcm1hdGlvbi1zeXN0ZW1zLWFpLTIzNTkwOTE_aWNvPW1vc3RfcG9wdWxhctIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

SpaceX is joining the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to fight a lawsuit brought by environmental groups, according to media reports.  That suit, which was filed on May 1, claims that the FAA didn't properly assess the damage that SpaceX's giant Starship rocket could cause to the environmentally sensitive lands surrounding its South Texas launch site.  The FAA approved 20 Starship launches annually for the next five years from Starbase, SpaceX's facility near Boca Chica Beach on Texas' Gulf Coast. The first of those flights lifted off on April 20, aiming to send Starship's upper stage most of the way around our planet, with a return to Earth in the Pacific Ocean near Hawaii.  That didn't happen. The 394-foot-tall (120 meters) Starship — the most powerful rocket ever built — notched a number of important milestones on the debut launch, eventually reaching a maximum altitude of 24 miles (39 kilometers). But it suffered several problems that impelled SpaceX to send a self-destruct command, and the rocket exploded high over the Gulf of Mexico about four minutes after liftoff.

Standing at 12.5 inches (32 cm), this is a 1:375 ratio. See our roundup of awesome Starship gear.  The 33 Raptor engines on Starship's first-stage booster, known as Super Heavy, kicked up a huge cloud of dust and other debris during the launch. Some of that material rained down on the surrounding area, noted the lawsuit, which was filed by the Center for Biological Diversity, the American Bird Conservancy, the Surfrider Foundation, Save RGV and the Carrizo/Comecrudo Nation of Texas.  And that wasn't the only impact to the Boca Chica area, which is important to the Carrizo/Comecrudo Nation and provides ""important habitat for imperiled wildlife, including piping plovers, northern aplomado falcons, Gulf Coast jaguarundi, ocelots and critically endangered sea turtles,"" the Center for Biological Diversity wrote in a statement on May 1.  ""Rocket launches and explosions cause significant harm through increased vehicle traffic and the intense heat, noise, and light pollution from construction and launch activities,"" the Arizona-based nonprofit wrote. ""Rocket explosions spread debris across surrounding habitat and have caused brush fires.""  The FAA required SpaceX to perform more than 75 ""mitigating"" actions in order to launch Starship from Starbase but did not file a full environmental impact statement (EIS). The lawsuit, which you can read here, calls on the FAA to perform that more complete review.  Video: Every SpaceX Starship explosion and what we learned from them  But requiring such a step would likely be harmful to SpaceX, according to the company, which filed a motion on Friday (May 19) requesting to join the FAA as a defendant in the lawsuit.  ""If the Court were to rule in Plaintiffs' favor, the FAA's decision could be set aside, and further licensing of the Starship/Super Heavy Program could be significantly delayed, causing severe injury to SpaceX's business,"" SpaceX wrote in the filing, CNBC reported on Monday (May 22).  SpaceX's filing also highlighted the potential damage to the ""national interest"" should the plaintiffs win, according to CNBC. For example, Starship is a key part of the United States' path back to the moon: NASA selected the huge vehicle as the first crewed lunar lander for its Artemis moon program.  If all goes according to plan, Starship will put astronauts down near the moon's south pole in 2025 or thereabouts, on the Artemis 3 mission.  SpaceX has already invested more than $3 billion in the Starship program and Starbase facility since 2014, the company's chief financial officer, Bret Johnsen, wrote in a declaration submitted along with the SpaceX motion, according to CNBC.  Johnsen also noted that Starship is vital to the company's plans for its Starlink satellite-internet constellation, which already serves about 1.5 million people around the world. Starship will be needed to launch the larger, more powerful Starlink ""V2"" spacecraft, as company founder and CEO Elon Musk has said.

"explosion","1993-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Washington"", ""DistrictOfColumbia"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T16:10:20","Washington, D.C. — Subcommittee on Communications and Technology Chair Bob Latta (R-OH) delivered opening remarks at today’s Communications and Technology Subcommittee hearing titled “Oversight and Reauthorization of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration.”  Excerpts and highlights below:  MAJOR CHANGES IN COMMUNICATIONS SINCE 1993  “Good morning, and welcome back before this subcommittee, Assistant Secretary Davidson.  “Today’s hearing is to provide oversight of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, or NTIA, and discuss reauthorization of the agency.  “Since 1993 when NTIA was last reauthorized, the communications landscape has changed drastically.  “NTIA has important statutory obligations to manage federal-use spectrum, coordinate other Internet and communications functions between the Executive Branch, and support public safety communications initiatives.  “NTIA’s budget has increased substantially as their duties have grown, federal and non-federal use of spectrum has intensified with the explosion of mobile phones and improved technologies, and cybersecurity challenges have dramatically increased.  “It is Congress’s role, and specifically this Subcommittee’s role, to oversee and authorize the agency’s funding and priorities to ensure communications policy continues to benefit Americans and drive our economy.  “Since our last oversight hearing, NTIA has submitted its 2024 budget request for $117.3 million, nearly double its current authorization.  “With this new budget request and several other new initiatives being implemented by NTIA, this hearing will serve as the first step in much-needed oversight and transparency into this agency.  “For example, NTIA has formalized existing spectrum coordination procedures with the FCC by updating their memorandum of understanding, which members on this Committee had advocated for.”  OVERSIGHT OF NTIA SUBSIDY PROGRAMS  “NTIA has also begun implementing several broadband subsidy programs.  “Today’s oversight hearing is the first with NTIA since it published its Notice of Funding Opportunity, or NO-FO, for the BEAD Program.  “These NO-FOs include the rules of the road for how these programs will be administered.  “Getting these rules right is crucial, including technology neutrality, will ultimately determine whether all Americans are connected or if they will continue to be left on the wrong side of the digital divide.  “Today, we have 18 pieces of draft legislation to discuss during today’s hearing to jump start discussion on NTIA’s evolving mission and seek feedback from the agency.”  REAUTHORIZING AND MODERNIZING THE NTIA  “I am pleased to be leading the NTIA Reauthorization Act of 2023 to begin a bipartisan discussion on how Congress can ensure NTIA has the statutory tools it needs to fulfill its mission.  “The NTIA Reauthorization Act would elevate the Assistant Secretary to an Under Secretary level, modernize the agency’s policies and missions, and authorize its funding to match current funding levels.  “Other discussion drafts on today’s hearing would elevate NTIA’s role in coordinating interagency broadband funding and permitting processes, support NTIA’s Federal spectrum management mission, and reflect NTIA’s expertise as a federal coordinator and convener by granting authority to coordinate public safety and cybersecurity policy development and representation.  “With the billions of dollars available for broadband deployment being managed by a variety of federal agencies, coordination will be key to ensuring that money isn’t wasted.  “As the lead agency for broadband, NTIA should lead the development of a national broadband strategy.  “Other components of the reauthorization effort would require NTIA to lead efforts on developing common models, methodologies, and inputs to inform spectrum management decisions, ensure NTIA benefits from the expertise of commercial spectrum users, and make reforms to federal spectrum relocation processes.  “I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for leading on the initiatives before us.  “The role of NTIA has drastically changed since it was last reauthorized, and I look forward to working with the agency and affected stakeholders to update its authorizing statute.  “Finally, I am pleased we are beginning oversight efforts this Congress, which includes ensuring that NTIA is being good stewards of tax dollars allocated for broadband expansion and funds are going toward unserved or underserved communities.  “These oversight efforts will be the crucial link to help close the digital divide and make sure all Americans are connected by high-speed, broadband Internet.  “Before I yield back, I did want to note that for this subcommittee to effectively conduct oversight, we need your testimony within the 48-hour requirement moving forward.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL2VuZXJneWNvbW1lcmNlLmhvdXNlLmdvdi9wb3N0cy9jLWFuZC10LXN1YmNvbW1pdHRlZS1jaGFpci1sYXR0YS1vcGVuaW5nLXJlbWFya3Mtb24tb3ZlcnNpZ2h0LWFuZC1yZWF1dGhvcml6YXRpb24tb2YtbnRpYdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"explosion","2024-02-14","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-23T07:24:12","E INK is experiencing explosive demand for its electronic shelf labels. These replace traditional price labels in grocery stores, big box retailers, and everywhere. Instead of stock boys manually changing the prices, price changes are done by management with computers that can change the prices on anything that the store sells, making it easier to do.  A week ago, E INK announced that a deal reached between Walmart and e-paper solution provider SES-imagotag to deploy the next-generation retail IoT networks and ESLs at several hundred US retail chain store shops would help boost the adoption of ESL solutions. The deal calls for installing over 60 million ESLs during the first phase of operations, which will last for 12–18 months. A couple of years ago, E INK invested in SES since they are the most significant player in the shelf label space, and various E INK executives had seats on the board of directors.  For 2023, EIH expects its revenue to grow within a single-digit range as macroeconomic environments remain weak. In addition to ESL solutions, the CEO of E INK believes that demand for colour e-book readers and e-notes will gain momentum in 2024, driving revenue growth at EIH.  There are a few technologies that make shelf labels a reality. The primary one is called Spectra, which has various colour configurations. Spectra 3000 has white and red, perfect for price tags. Spectra 3100 has four colours, and Spectra 31000 Plus adds orange. Aurora e-paper is used in freezers and refrigerators; the tech is designed to withstand sub-zero temperatures.  E INK’s latest generation tech is Spectra 6, a full-colour product, providing a level of colour saturation and vividness never before seen in a reflective display and with the ability to give a visual performance similar to the most advanced paper colour printers on the market today. It features an enhanced colour spectrum and a refined colour imaging algorithm to provide full colour to improve marketing and advertising performance. It has 200 pixels per inch (PPI), depending on panel size, and a typical contrast ratio 30:1.

"explosion","2023-05-22","11:30:00","{""Washington"", ""DistrictOfColumbia"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T11:00:00","© Provided by Washington Examiner  REAL FAKE NEWS: It was a beautiful spring Monday in Washington when officials and reporters in the Pentagon began to be barraged with questions about a reported explosion outside the building, which according to a photo that quickly went viral, was sending a massive plume of black smoke into the air. It was quickly revealed to be a hoax.  “There's no explosion or fire at or near the Pentagon-apparently these are false reports circulating on social media,” tweeted Voice of America correspondent Carla Babb. “People inside the building have absolutely no idea about any explosion.”  To anyone familiar with the Pentagon, the photo was obviously fake, or at the very least, not the Pentagon. The building pictured was too tall and looked nothing like the iconic five-sided building.  But after the initial report was tweeted from a “verified” Twitter account that claimed to be retweeting Bloomberg News reports, the photo reached millions of people who saw it on Russia's RT site and in breaking news reports as far away as India. The account @BloombergFeed has been suspended.  The Arlington County Fire Department, which was the first to respond to the 9/11 attack in 2001, was forced to tweet out a denial. “There is NO explosion or incident taking place at or near the Pentagon reservation, and there is no immediate danger or hazards to the public.”  THE MEANINGLESS BLUE CHECK: The fake image, which many posited was created by artificial intelligence, hit the internet just after 9:30 a.m. when the stock market opened, triggering computerized algorithmic trading, which tracks news events, and causing a brief dip in the S&P 500 before the fake photo was was debunked.  Many observers speculated that the hoax was an attempt to manipulate the market just enough to make a profit on the small 0.3% ripple.  But many critics focused on the problem created when Twitter owner Elon Musk began selling blue check verification last year for $8 a month. As a result, the blue check no longer indicates that the individual or organization is who they purport to be, and fake accounts have been proliferating.  The fake Pentagon image initially gained traction because it appeared to come from a legitimate, verified account.  THE LIAR’S DIVIDEND: While the hoax was quickly exposed and the market recovered, the episode underscores the other insidious threat of realistic AI-generated images combined with Twitter accounts impersonating legitimate officials and organizations to not only spread false narratives but to also undermine the public trust in the news media, already at a historic low.  The phenomenon is known as the “Liar’s Dividend,” the idea that fake news not only tricks people into believing something false is true but also that it increases suspicion that true things are false.  “The Liar’s Dividend suggests that in addition to fueling the flames of falsehoods, the debunking efforts actually legitimize the debate over the veracity,” said the non-profit Poynter Institute in a 2019 essay. “This creates smoke and fans suspicions among at least some in the audience that there might well be something true about the claim.”  The corrosive effect of the rise of fake news is that even well-informed news consumers can become confused about what to believe.

HAPPENING TODAY: Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin meets with Czech Republic Defense Minister Jana Cernochova at the Pentagon at 2 p.m.  WHAT’S HAPPENING IN BELGOROD? It’s not entirely clear what’s going on in a small border town in Russia’s Belgorod region, where pro-Ukrainian partisans apparently carried out a cross-border incursion that “captured” the hamlet of Kozinka.  The Kremlin said the incursion was the work of Ukrainian saboteurs and said Russian troops would “push them out from the Russian territory and liquidate them.”  In a video, the invaders variously called themselves the “Russian Volunteer Corps” or “Liberty of Russia Legion” and said they are anti-Putin partisans who seek to “end the Kremlin's dictatorship.”  “We are Russians just like you. We are people just like you. We want our children to grow up in peace and be free people, so that they can travel, study and just be happy in a free country,” a gun-toting spokesman said.  RUSSIAN GOVERNOR ALARMED AS PRO-UKRAINE MILITIAS STRIKE TO 'LIBERATE' BORDER REGION  UK: RUSSIA FACING BORDER UNREST: The latest intelligence update from the British Defense Ministry confirms that there have been several days of fighting between Russian security forces and partisans but says the identity of the pro-Ukrainian forces has not been confirmed.  “Russia has evacuated several villages and has deployed extra security forces to the area,” according to the update. “Russia is facing an increasingly serious multi-domain security threat in its border regions, with losses of combat aircraft, improvised explosive device attacks on rail lines, and now direct partisan action.”  “Russia will almost certainly use these incidents to support the official narrative that it is the victim in the war.”  RUSSIA CLAIMS SUCCESS IN BAKHMUT AS UKRAINE SHIFTS FOCUS TO CITY'S OUTSKIRTS  CEMENTING A PACIFIC ALLY: Because President Joe Biden has to rush back to Washington to deal with the looming debt ceiling crisis, it fell to Secretary of State Antony Blinken to sign a new security pact with Papua New Guinea as the United States seeks to shore up alliances in the Pacific to counter China’s growing influence.  “The agreements that we reached, the work that we’re doing, is not about any other country. It’s about our relationship with the Pacific Islands and the shared vision that we have for this region,” said Blinken during a stop in Port Moresby. “We need a region where countries are free to choose their own path and their own partners, where problems will be dealt openly, transparently.”  In a statement, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin called the U.S.-Papua New Guinea Defense Cooperation Agreement “an important milestone” that will help ensure the “security and prosperity” of the region.  Papua New Guinea, which was the site of many battles in World War II, is strategically located just north of Australia and is the most populous Pacific Island nation, with a population of nearly 10 million.  “This agreement will serve as the foundational framework for our two countries to enhance our security cooperation, improve the capacity of the PNG Defence Force, and increase stability and security in the region,” Austin said.  WHO DID US KILL IN SYRIA? The possibility that the U.S. military may have killed an innocent civilian instead of a senior al Qaeda leader in Syria three weeks ago has two Democrats in the House calling for a full investigation, reported Washington Examiner defense reporter Mike Brest.  Last week, Maj. John Moore, a spokesman for the U.S. Central Command, told Brest that it is ""investigating to determine whether or not the action may have unintentionally resulted in harm to civilians.”  “We’re alarmed by reports that the U.S. military is no longer confident this strike killed a senior al-Qaeda official and instead may have killed Lotfi Hassan Misto, a father of ten who was tending to his sheep in northwest Syria,"" Reps. Sara Jacobs (D-CA) and Jason Crow (D-CO), the co-chairs of the Protection of Civilians in Conflict Caucus, said in a statement. ""Since forming this caucus last year, we’ve focused on preventing, reducing, and making amends for incidents of civilian harm — and it’s clear that our work is still sorely needed.”  The possibility that the strike killed an innocent chicken farmer was first reported by the Washington Post, which said it was “unclear whether American commanders overseeing the strike realized Misto lived close by, whether his home’s proximity to the ‘known area of interest’ to al-Qaeda was a factor in their belief that he was a militant.”  KEY GROUP OF LAWMAKERS CALLS FOR 'FULL INVESTIGATION' INTO SYRIAN STRIKE  The Rundown  Washington Examiner: Russian governor alarmed as pro-Ukraine militias strike to 'liberate' border region  Washington Examiner: Russia claims success in Bakhmut as Ukraine shifts focus to city's outskirts  Washington Examiner: Key group of lawmakers calls for 'full investigation' into Syrian strike  Washington Examiner: McCarthy says no debt ceiling deal yet despite improved 'tone' after tensions  Washington Examiner: Israel sees ‘high potential’ for ‘big war’ with Iran-backed Hezbollah  Washington Examiner: Top Chinese and Russian spy chiefs meet in Moscow  Washington Examiner: White House offers rare support for GOP bill to tackle one section of border crisis  Washington Examiner: Fentanyl seizures at the border in April reach record high  Washington Examiner: Crenshaw slams Biden's 'wrong' defense instincts: 'Don't know what goes on in Biden's head'  Washington Examiner: Opinion: France wins China's silent favor for diluted G7 communique  National Defense Magazine: Debt Default Would Be ‘Catastrophic’ For National Security, Service Chiefs Say  Politico: How Tuberville’s Blockade Of Pentagon Nominees Could End  Washington Post: Before-and-after images show why Zelensky compared Bakhmut’s destruction to Hiroshima  Reuters: UN Concerned By Lack Of Grain Ships Going To One Ukrainian Port  AP: US Bomb Designed to Hit Targets Like Iran Underground Nuclear Sites Briefly Reappears Amid Tensions  Wall Street Journal: Rise in Nuclear Arms Threatens Curbs  AP: Air Force Looks to Better Control Access to Classified Data After Intelligence Leak  Air & Space Forces Magazine: Kendall: F-16s Not a ‘Game-Changer’ for Ukraine But ‘Something They Need’  Politico: How Biden Got to Yes on F-16s and Ukraine  19fortyfive.com: Putin Might Send Su-57 Stealth Fighters to Ukraine to Hunt F-16s  19fortyfive.com: Quadcopters: Why Russia, Ukraine and America Have Different Drone Strategies  Air & Space Forces Magazine: Air Force Will Pick Just One NGAD Design in 2024, Kendall Says  19fortyfive.com: 'Old' Soldiers: Why Russia's Military Is Being Destroyed in Ukraine  Air & Space Forces Magazine: New House Bill Aims to Keep 25 ANG Fighter Squadrons.

Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) said that from June 1, all e-scooters, e-unicycles, e-skateboards and hoverboards will be banned from its network.  People will not be allowed to bring them on Southern, Gatwick Express, Thameslink and Great Northern services. Southeastern and South Western Railway will also be banning e-scooters from next Thursday.  It comes following a number of incidents on railway lines where the lithium-ion batteries overheat which can cause “fires, explosions and toxic gas to be released”.  MOST READ:  The rail operator said many of the e-scooters are “cheaply made and unregulated” which poses a risk to passengers and staff at stations.

The same informaion was also published by other Russian-language media outlets, including osnmedia.ru, news22.ru, adi19.ru, news.ru, dzen.ru, and riamo.ru.  The articles claim that on May 15, a sharp – 6-7 times increase in the level of bismuth was recorded by the measuring instruments in Lublin, Poland. The article refers to the Telegram Channel of Kremlin propagandist political scientist Yakov Kedmi, arguing that Polish residents think the radiation threat is coming from Ukraine’s Khmelnytskyi region.  The claim that the explosion in the Khmelnytsky region of Ukraine caused an increase in the radiation levels in Poland is manipulative. According to Poland’s National Atomic Energy Agency, the temporary rise in bismuth levels is the result of natural conditions and is not anyhow related to the explosion in Ukraine.  In a statement released on May 17, Poland’s National Atomic Energy Agency denied the disseminated claim, stressing that the radiation level in the country remains stable. According to the statement, this is a standard situation that does not threaten human health, life, or the environment. The agency also urged people to be wary of disinformation.  The claim was also verified by the Polish fact-checking platform Fakenews.pl. They compared bismuth readings for September 2022 and May 2023. The analysis showed that in September 2022, the bismuth level was, in fact, higher.  The bismuth level in Lublin,September 2022 Source: UMCS  According to Prof. Paweł Moskal, the effect of poisoning caused by nuclear radiation depends on the strength of the specific immune system. Therefore, it is not possible to unambiguously determine the universal lethal dose. Instead, the dose is being determined only after half of the population dies within 30 days. In humans, it is about 3.5 Sievert (Sv) is a unit that expresses the amount of radiation energy absorbed by living tissue in relation to the biological effects of radiation. The radiation level measured in Lublin on May 15 was 0.66 µSv/h, so it was significantly below the anomalous threshold and more than 5 million times below the life-threatening dose.  The administration of the Khmelnytskyi region stated on May 13 that 21 people were injured as a result of a Russian drone attack on the region overnight.  Russia launched 21 Iranian-made Kamikaze “Shahid” drones to attack Ukrainian cities at night on May 13. According to the information released by the Air Force of Ukraine, the military managed to shoot down 17 of them, but four penetrated the defenses and hit the Khmelnytskyi region, resulting in an explosion.  About the Source  Political scientist Yaakov Kedmi appears in the “Putin List” prepared by Free Russia as a person who cooperates with Putin’s regime and is involved in the propaganda of Russian TV channels. Since the beginning of the 2010s, Kedmi has become a frequent guest of Russian TV channels, especially Россия 1 and ITON.TV.  Kedmi regularly criticizes Ukraine and constantly accuses it of anti-Semitism and collaboration with Nazism. In addition, Kedmi also justifies Russia’s actions in Syria. Kedmi is a reliable source for Russian propaganda not only in Russia per se, but also outside its borders. For example, Sputnik, one of the main Russian propaganda platforms, uses Kedmi’s figure to legitimize different opinions in Belarus, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. In 2023 the Council of the European Union imposed personal sanctions against him for conducting Russian propaganda.

On Jan. 4, an explosion of a nuclear reactor killed three people in Idaho Falls.  While the weather was cold and icy, it paled in comparison to the icyness of the relations between the Soviet Union and the United States. The Cold War was heating up fast. In January 1961, President Dwight D. Eisenhower broke diplomatic relations with Cuba, and all Americans were advised to evacuate.  Other headlines from the first months of 1961 included “U.S. Newsmen in Cuba held,” “Boston flier said killed, Havana hit” and “Soviets test nuclear weapons.” At the bottom of the front page, in a 15-part series over as many days, the News-Herald ran “Knowing What to do Increases Your Chances You Can Survive Atomic Attack.” It detailed how to build a “poor man’s fallout shelter,” the danger of the radiation, how long to stay in the shelter in case of attack, essentials needed in the shelter, what different bombs do, how to survive them and how to cope with and clean up in the aftermath.  Email newsletter signup Newsletter  While nuclear war was on everyone’s mind, their eyes were turned to the sky or the closest television set.  On May 5, 1961, Alan Shepard Jr. was the first American launched into space. The United States had reached a historic moment in the space race. Shepard radioed from the weightless void of space that he could see, through his periscope, the entire East Coast of the United States.  In August, scientists announced it may be a decade or more before permanent bases are established on the moon. On Feb. 20, 1962, John Glenn became the first human to orbit earth.  “Shortly after launch, Glenn reported a tremendous view of the earth stretching back to Cape Canaveral. He also said he saw his booster rocket falling away after it had unleashed him on his orbital path. Over the Canary Islands, he said that the horizon appeared to be a brilliant blue. “I am very comfortable,” he said. “I have a wonderful view of Africa. I have the Canaries in view through the window but they are partly obscured by clouds.’’ He said his view of Africa also was partly blocked by heavy clouds, which gradually thinned out as he passed out over the Indian Ocean. Glenn had a good view of the southern United States as he passed over on completion of his first orbit. President Kennedy was reported as very pleased that the flight was going off successfully.  Post offices around the country had packages delivered prior to Feb. 20 marked do not open. Once Glenn was picked up from the Atlantic following his flight and deemed safe, a message went out to all post offices to open the packages and sell the commemorative stamps.  The same week as the history-making space orbit, a new comic was advertised on the front page: “The Flintstones.” The notice said, “Even in the Space Age, everyone will find a chuckle in the Stone Age satire.”  In May 1962, a new medical procedure that could be performed by ordinary people was unveiled. The procedure, known now as Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation, or CPR, was at the time called “Reviving a heart beat” and said to have been developed to restore heartbeat and breathing to a person whose heart has stopped. Diagrams included on the page illustrated the procedure. The short article explained “direct breathing mouth to nose” and proper external heart massage can prevent damage to the brain and other organs if done within four minutes of the heart stopping.  In other medical news, Dr. Sue Eggleston Woodward became the first female doctor who was a native Suffolkian. There had been female doctors practicing in Suffolk, and there had been Suffolkian women who became doctors and went elsewhere, but Dr. Woodward was the first Suffolk-raised and practicing female doctor.  In May 1961, some workmen in the Great Dismal Swamp discovered a safe, stolen 16 years prior from a service station, along the Jericho Ditch. The safe was turned over to the sheriff’s department and then returned to Spivey’s Texaco station on U.S. 13. Delmer Spivey found old account statements in the remains of the safe dating back to 1932. Despite their long immersion in water, the bills were legible.  In November of 1962, a break in the tension finally came, as 40 Soviet rockets stationed in Cuba were dismantled and removed, immediately followed by the end of the Cuba blockade.

Reports from insiders stated that the headset was falling short of even 300k sales in its first couple of weeks on shelves. Thankfully, we now have some solid numbers, and it turns out that the PS VR 2 is doing decently, outpacing the sales of its predecessor comfortably.  Thanks to the information shared from Sony's May 24th Games & Network Services presentation, we've learned that the PS VR2 sold nearly 600,000 units in its first six weeks, which puts it 50k ahead of the first six-week sales of the PS VR1.  These are great numbers to dispel the rumours that the headset was not selling well, but also dispel feelings that the headset is falling and isn't worth investing in right now.

A dilapidated Levin house that was the focal point of a 24-hour standoff with armed police, has sold at auction for $276,000.  The police tape is long gone, but the charred doorway and boarded-up windows make it clear little else has changed since a man was pulled from a fire at the Bledisloe St address on August 5, 2022, following an intense standoff.  Paul Kenneth Smith​​, 62, had barricaded himself in his late mother’s house, making a number of threats which led to police locking down the street and evacuating 80 residents.  The house was sold “as is, where is” at auction on Wednesday by Wilton & Co Realty. Advice in the listing said it was an opportunity “not for the faint-hearted”.  READ MORE:  * Levin returns to the Middle Ages with medieval market  * Safety improvements on notorious stretch of State Highway 1 bring hope if not confidence  * Man at centre of Napier lockdown emerged from house with baby    The three-bedroom home, on an 820-square-metre section with a ratable value of $320,000, had sustained smoke damage and water damage, and asbestos had also been detected.  Auctioneer Tina Chamberlain said the auction attracted 37 bids from eight interested parties, five of whom were in the room, and three were on the phone.  The majority were attracted by the property’s development potential, by knocking down the house and subdividing.  “It’s a phenomenal result for a home not viewed internally, that’s structurally compromised with fire damage and asbestos.”  Chamberlain said there was room for two, possibly three, homes on the site.  WARWICK SMITH/Stuff Emergency services on Bledisloe Street on August 5 last year after an intense standoff with police ends in flames.  Salesperson Adriana Wilton said it was unusual to be selling a property where a respirator and torch were required to enter the house.  “It’s definitely not open home material.”  She said sale by auction was a great way to be open with potential buyers on the state of the house, while also securing the best price for the estate.  DAVID UNWIN Bledisloe Street in Levin is closed off by police as they negotiate with a man who has barricaded himself in his home. (First published, August 5, 2022)  Houses listed “as is, where is” typically had substantial damage due to a natural disaster or neglect.  Wilton said a new owner would be “starting from scratch” in respect to the interior of the house. There was still some furniture and other items inside the family may clear before settlement.  Paul Smith’s occupation of the house came to a fiery end. Onlookers saw orange flashes followed by smoke and a burning smell as the tenant was rushed to hospital with smoke inhalation.  He remains in custody, on a variety of charges, while the court decides if he is fit to stand trial.  Stuff The windows of the house were boarded up by the former owner’s son when it was on the market.  Much of his distress stemmed from his fight to stay in the house amid a four-year dispute with his brother Thomas Smith over the property, following the death of their mother Veronica Smith in 2017.  Paul Smith had been made the sole executor of his mother’s will but failed to carry out his duties, which included selling the house and distributing and splitting the residue with his brother.  The high court stripped him of the role in 2021, and in April 2022 Paul Smith was ordered to vacate the property as his presence, which included boarding up the windows, made it impossible for the administrator to sell it.  Chamberlain said Wilton & Co had done a fantastic job marketing the property, and that it was uncommon to have eight people bidding on an auction in the current market.  The winning bid came from someone dialling into the auction by phone.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdHVmZi5jby5uei9tYW5hd2F0dS1zdGFuZGFyZC9uZXdzLzMwMDg4Nzg1NS9sZXZpbi1ob21lLXdoZXJlLTI0aG91ci1wb2xpY2Utc3RhbmRvZmYtZW5kZWQtd2l0aC1leHBsb3Npb24tYXVjdGlvbmVkLWFzLWlzLXdoZXJlLWlz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"explosion","2023-09-17","09:30:00","{""Arlington"", ""Virginia"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T13:44:00","Photo: The Canadian Press  An image of black smoke billowing next to a bureaucratic-looking building spread across social media Monday morning, with the claim that it showed an explosion near the Pentagon.  The posts sent a brief shiver through the stock market and were quickly picked up by news outlets outside the U.S., before officials jumped in to clarify that no blast actually took place and the photo was a fake.  Experts say the viral image had telltale signs of an AI-generated forgery, and its popularity underscores the everyday chaos these now increasingly sophisticated and easy-to-access programs can inflict.  Here’s a closer look at the facts.  CLAIM: An image shows an explosion near the Pentagon.  THE FACTS: Police and fire officials in Arlington, Virginia, say the image is not real and there was no incident at the U.S. Department of Defense headquarters across the Potomac from the nation’s capital.  Despite this, the image and claim was spread by outlets including RT, a Russian government-backed media company formerly known as Russia Today. It was also widely shared in investment circles, including an account bearing Twitter's signature blue verification check mark that falsely suggested it was associated with Bloomberg News.  “Reports of an explosion near the Pentagon in Washington DC,” the Russian state news agency wrote in a since-deleted tweet to its more than three million followers.  The timing of the fake image, which appeared to spread widely just after the U.S. stock market opened for trading at 9:30 a.m., was enough to send a ripple through the investment world.  The S&P 500 briefly dropped a modest 0.3% as social media accounts and investment websites popular with day traders repeated the false claims.  Other investments also moved in ways that typically occur when fear enters the market. Prices for U.S. Treasury bonds and gold, for example, briefly began to climb, suggesting investors were looking for someplace safer to park their money.  The image's rapid spread prompted the Arlington County Fire Department to take to social media to knock down the rumors.  “@PFPAOfficial and the ACFD are aware of a social media report circulating online about an explosion near the Pentagon,” the agency wrote, referring to the acronym for the Pentagon Force Protection Agency that polices the Pentagon. “There is NO explosion or incident taking place at or near the Pentagon reservation, and there is no immediate danger or hazards to the public.”  Capt. Nate Hiner, a spokesperson for the fire department, confirmed the agency’s tweet was authentic but declined to comment further, deferring to the Pentagon police force, which didn’t respond to email and phone messages.  Misinformation experts say the fake image was likely created using generative artificial intelligence programs, which have allowed increasingly realistic, but oftentimes flawed, visuals to flood the internet recently.  Inconsistencies in the building, fence and surrounding area are imperfections typically found in AI-generated images, noted Hany Farid, a computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who specializes in digital forensics, misinformation and image analysis.  “Specifically, the grass and concrete fade into each other, the fence is irregular, there is a strange black pole that is protruding out of the front of the sidewalk but is also part of the fence,” he wrote in an email. “The windows in the building are inconsistent with photos of the Pentagon that you can find online.”  Chirag Shah, co-director of the Center for Responsibility in AI Systems & Experiences at the University of Washington in Seattle, cautioned that spotting fakes won’t always be as obvious.  Society will need to lean more on “crowdsourcing and community vigilance to weed out bad information and arrive at the truth” as AI technology improves, he argued.  “Simply relying on detection tools or social media posts are not going to be enough,” Shah wrote in an email.  Before the explosion hoax, the biggest Beltway intrigue on Wall Street’s mind Monday morning was whether the U.S. government will avoid a disastrous default on its debt.  But as the market is becoming increasingly reactive to headline-grabbing news, misinformation can be especially damaging when it’s shared by outlets even vaguely deemed as credible, said Adam Kobeissi, editor-in-chief at The Kobeissi Letter, an industry publication.  “A lot of these moves are happening because of high frequency trading, algorithmic trading, which is basically taking headlines, synthesizing them and then breaking them down into a trade on a millisecond basis,” he explained by phone, noting that much of the market is now automated. “It’s basically like you’re pulling a trigger every time a headline comes out.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhc3RhbmV0Lm5ldC9lZGl0aW9uL25ld3Mtc3RvcnktNDI4MDgyLTUtLmh0bdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The win sends the Tigers back to the state baseball tournament for the second year in a row which will be played at Go-Mart Park in Charleston next week.  “Honestly I didn’t know what to expect out of (PikeView ace Nathan) Riffe. This was the first time we saw him,” Shady Spring head coach Jordan Meadows said. “I told the guys to be aggressive. If you find your pitch, hit it. We were busting it in the gaps and we were stealing. It was a lot of fun early.”  Shady Spring heeded the advice and started quickly with run scoring hits from Cam Manns, Cash McCall and Brody Seabolt for a 3-0 lead.  PikeView got one back in the bottom of the first when Zach Rose doubled home Drew Damewood, but that was the calm before the storm.  Six hits and three PikeView errors amounted to nine second-inning runs to completely knock the wind out the sails of the Panthers.  “I think these guys came in hungry. We hit the baseball early and we got what we wanted,” Meadows said. “That gave (starting pitcher Colten) Tate a little cushion and we knew all along that Cam was going to close no matter what the score was.”  A pair of leadoff walks put PikeView in a jam to start the second frame. The scoring started on a single from Tate and a sacrifice fly from Manns for 5-1 lead.  Adam Richmond ripped a single to score Tate before back-to-back doubles from Cash McCall and Parker Brown made it a 7-1 advantage.  When Seabolt’s grounder could not be played, another run scored in front of Aiden Calvert who ripped a double to push the lead out to 9-1.  “Brody did exactly what he did yesterday. He started beating it the other way and putting the ball in play,” Meadows said. “Calvert laced one up in the gap. Calvert and Seabolt, this is the first (year) they have started, so that is huge going into our future.”  Coming off a strong performance in game one, Parker Brown, Seabolt and Calvert were once again key contributors combining for four hits and six RBI.  Two PikeView errors and an RBI-single from Jake Meadows tallied three more runs for a commanding 12-1 lead before the home team stepped to the plate for the second time.  “It is a positive sign going into the state tournament no matter who we play,” Meadows said about the hitting outburst. “We are excited. That is the best we have hit in a long time. We have practice all this week, so we will wait to see who we play (in the state tournament) and get ready for it.”  Tate led the Shady hitters with four hits and a pair of RBI, while Richmond collected two hits and drove home three runs.  “Adam is a guy that if he is not hitting the baseball, he changes bat. He has changed bats like 14 times, but this week he found a bat he liked,” Meadows said. “In our inter-squad scrimmage he hit two home runs. Today he hit the ball hard as well. Adam is a great player. He is a good team leader that has been starting for three years. He is a great four hitter for us.”  A bat switch in the sectional championship game got Richmond going.  “I have been switching around from a 34 (inch) to a 33 end-loaded. I finally picked up a one-piece CATX which is a little more balanced. Now I am finding a lot more barrels and hitting the ball harder,” Richmond said. “I caught a barrel with it the first time I picked it up in the championship game against Nicholas County. I ripped a double into the gap and that really boosted my confidence. I have been hitting the ball ever since.”  Shady know waits for the seeding to be announced for the state tournament. Game one is Friday and will be played at either 5 p.m. or 30 minutes after the 5 p.m. game.  “We took out their ace tonight in the second inning and that is all we could ask for. If we can hit it like this going forward, we are going to be hard to beat,” Manns said. “We have to go into that first game at the state tournament confident and we have to play our best. Right now, 1-through-9, we are all hitting the ball. I am proud of the boys.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmxvb3RwcmVzcy5jb20vcHJlcC1iYXNlYmFsbC1zaGFkeS1zcHJpbmctYmF0cy1leHBsb2RlLXRvLXdpbi10aGUtcmVnaW9uLTMtY2hhbXBpb25zaGlwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"explosion","2013-12-03","Not Discerned","{""Dimapur"", ""Nagaland"", ""India""}","2023-05-23T15:17:59","Dr Asangba Tzudir  Connecting Nagaland  The flow of information defines our times today. It is also attested by the way in which social media came into our everyday life. There is social media explosion and have ruled our lives. However, the very name and template is such that it is in no way considered as an alternative to print media especially the newspapers. Nonetheless, social media poses various challenges to print media and one among them is readership.  Generally, with the social media explosion, not just the loss in subscription and readership but even the time spent on reading a newspaper surely must have dropped. Social media has somehow become the immediate ‘newsworthy’ channel to disseminate breaking news, that by the time it is published in newspapers, it no more qualifies as breaking news. Though many forms of news shared in social news are confirmed by newspapers it has also made the newspaper redundant.  While the real challenge presented before the newspaper houses in Nagaland is not only to increase circulation but to generate the culture of reading. This is where the real media explosion in Nagaland becomes paramount. But before pressing on where the media needs to explode, it is imperative to revisit the Naga condition that finds shrouded within a crisis of post-modernity.  The crisis has stemmed from a situation where ‘God is killed’ and in the absence of a moral authority, ‘things’ are defined in one’s own terms. There is a shift from people becoming the author from being readers. There is a shift from the collective to the individual; there is a shift from the intellect to the material. There hardly is any ‘care’ for the ‘other’ or for the collectivity.  Cocooned within such an attitude is the fast paced life unlike in the more leisurely past. Today, the time consuming social obligations and engagements; the busy mornings; datelines etc. have made life so busy and fast, that there hardly is any time to engulf seriously in the pleasure activity of reading. And beyond the general banner headlines, unless there is something that concerns an individual or a particular group or section of people, one may not read.  There hardly is any collective engagement on the pressing issues nor is there dialogues that would enable healthy discussion and debates. And comfortably nestled within the confines of being an ‘author’ one rather keeps mastering one’s own narrow perspective defined in one’s own terms as the author.  While it is a very difficult proposition to completely or even partially unshackle the Naga condition, Newspapers have to create an explosion to redraw the people towards serious reading, to create a shift from author to reader first. There is a need for broadening the perspectives in order to inculcate a feeling of belongingness within the larger communitarian framework.  Within this framework, the real media explosion should begin by creating greater awareness and focusing on the worthiness of news and information about the ‘other’ but very much ‘us’. This can begin by giving greater emphasis on ‘localization’ and thereby give proper representation. This is one area which needs to be fully exploited in order to generate readership, so also to connect the people spiritually within a communitarian well-being. For now it is largely hampered by challenges of capital and human resources, and more so, transport and communication.  Along with the post-modern crisis, Nagaland continues to stay disconnected, and the ‘I’ and the ‘other’ dichotomy exists. A collectively shared feeling does not emerge, and the problems and sufferings of the other remains misunderstood or not known at all, often ignored or not taken seriously thereby destabilizing the communitarian principles underlying the larger good of the community.

In the explosion, two people, including a woman, were severely injured and were taken to a hospital. The incident occurred in the Bhangar area of the South 24 Parganas district. The blast was so intense that it ripped the roof of Shariful Mullah’s house.  advertisement  Following the incident, police were deployed in huge numbers in the area.  Meanwhile, the TMC has alleged that the bomb was hurled by the Indian Secular Front (ISF). The TMC said ISF was coercing Shariful Mullah to join their party.  Yesterday, a blast occurred at TMC panchayat member Sheikh Shafiq's house in West Bengal's Birbhum district. The house was damaged in the explosion. However, no casualties were reported in the blast.  Initial reports suggested that 'desi bombs' that were kept in the house may have led to the explosion.  The blasts come a week after the explosion at an illegal firecracker factory located in West Bengal's East Midnapore district on May 16.  Nine of the injured people were declared dead on arrival at the hospital, nine others were sent for treatment. The CID is investigating the case, and the West Bengal government announced a compensation of Rs 2.5 lakh for the kin of the deceased.

To top it all off, he works up to 20 hours per week as a delivery driver for DoorDash.  He started driving casually for the on-demand delivery company about five years ago to get some extra cash to support his cat rescue, which relies on community donations and his funding.  But Mr De Latora told TND inflation over the past year has stretched his finances and dried-up community donations, leaving him “backed into a corner” and unable to take a night off.  Key expenses like cat food have “tripled”, and the cost burden isn’t likely to let up any time soon, as many cats in the rescue have lived most of their lives on the streets and are too wild to be rehomed.  “Recently one of my cats passed away, and it didn’t matter how sad I was, I couldn’t afford to have the night off to mourn,” Mr De Latora said.  His situation is not unique; almost a third of DoorDash drivers have a full-time job and choose to ‘dash’ to supplement this income.  Workers scrambling to keep up with inflation  Finder data shows 7 per cent of Australians – equivalent to 1.4 million people – have taken on a second job to bring in extra cash as they struggle to deal with soaring food prices and cost of housing.  This comes after the Australian Bureau of Statistics found the number of multiple job holders increased by 2.7 per cent in the December quarter of 2022.  Greg Jericho, policy director at the Australia Institute’s Centre for Future Work, said people working multiple jobs to make ends meet was a rising trend pre-pandemic, but it “absolutely exploded” over the past 18 months.  “We’re seeing record numbers of people working two jobs,” he said.  “And we expect this to keep rising while wages fail to keep up with inflation.”  The Consumer Price Index rose 7 per cent over the 12 months to March, while the Wage Price Index rose 3.7 per cent in the same period.  Mr Jericho said there is a growing number of people with multiple jobs, but women and younger workers tend to make up the majority as these groups tend to be paid less and work less hours at their regular jobs.  Nearly a quarter of all secondary jobs are in the admin and support industry, with education, health care, hospitality and retail all seeing a high proportion of multiple job holders, he said.  “It’s just another example of how the pandemic, and also the recent bout of inflation, really has been borne by workers rather than by companies,” Mr Jericho said.  “Company profits are doing well. We’re seeing recent examples of very large profits by the banking sector … increased margins by Coles and Woolworths, and it’s workers who are the ones being forced to make ends meet by working more jobs just to get by.”  The cost of multiple jobs  Working multiple jobs may help alleviate money woes, but it also comes with a set of challenges and risks, said Greg Bamber, Monash University Department of Management and Monash Data Futures Institute professor and co-editor of International & Comparative Employment Relations.  These can include:  Increased stress and fatigue, which can affect physical and mental health  Reduced work-life balance and quality of life  Potential conflicts of interest or breaches of contract with employers  Possible tax implications or reduced entitlements to government benefits.  Professor Bamber said Australians looking to work multiple jobs should be wary of these factors and carefully weigh the pros and cons.  They should also seek professional advice from the likes of an appropriate union, employment lawyer or accountant, if they have any doubts or concerns about their rights and obligations.  “[To avoid conflicts of interest or other problems when working multiple jobs], ask your employers for their permission and approval before taking on another job and comply with their policies and contracts,” Professor Bamber said.  “Avoid working for competing or conflicting businesses that may harm your employers’ interests or reputation … [and] manage your time and energy effectively, so that you can perform well in all your jobs and avoid stress or burnout.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlbmV3ZGFpbHkuY29tLmF1L2ZpbmFuY2UvMjAyMy8wNS8yMy9tdWx0aXBsZS1qb2JzLWluZmxhdGlvbi13b3JrL9IBT2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlbmV3ZGFpbHkuY29tLmF1L2ZpbmFuY2UvMjAyMy8wNS8yMy9tdWx0aXBsZS1qb2JzLWluZmxhdGlvbi13b3JrL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"explosion","2020-03-20","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-23T14:34:43","Artist’s impression of a white dwarf sucking material from a companion helium star.  Adam Makarenko / W. M. Keck Observatory  In March 2020, astronomers detected a supernova designated SN 2020eyj. They weren't particularly impressed at first — just one more among the thousand supernovae found each year. But then its strange behavior caught researchers’ attention.  The supernova was of Type Ia, indicating that a white dwarf had exploded when it became more massive than it could handle. Most white dwarfs cross this limit when they merge with a white dwarf companion — the so-called double-degenerate scenario. But more than 100 days after the detection, it became apparent that this supernova wasn’t behaving like most Type Ias.  Further observations, presented in Nature, reveal a rare specimen. For the first time, astronomers have caught a Type Ia supernova shining at radio wavelengths, which allowed them to understand what caused the explosion: This time, the white dwarf at the heart of the explosion had no compact companion.  Two Formation Channels  Type Ia supernovae mark cataclysmic deaths of white dwarfs, the compact remnants of low-mass stars. However, an isolated white dwarf, being incredibly stable, won’t explode on its own. Instead, it needs a companion to push it over the edge, either another white dwarf or a normal star. In the double-degenerate case, two white dwarfs spiral toward each other, eventually colliding in an explosion.  In the other case, known as the single-degenerate scenario, a white dwarf siphons gas from a companion star, gaining mass in the process. At some point, the white dwarf ignites and blows up. The evolution of such a system depends on the masses of the two stars and their separation. All the different possible evolutionary paths make it hard to assess how prevalent either scenario really is.  “It’s really hard when you start including all the channels,” says Ashley Ruiter (University of New South Wales, Australia), a supernova expert not involved in the study. “You’re going to get different predictions depending on what you assume in your models.”  Observationally, the number of clear-cut cases remains low. However, while companions are difficult to observe directly, they leave a signature on their surroundings (known as the circumstellar medium). And this is where SN 2020eyj really shined.  First Radio Detection  About 100 days after detection, SN 2020eyj started emitting more visible light than expected, prompting interest. What’s more, special features in its spectrum revealed that the explosion's ejecta had crashed into the gas surrounding the star. Theory predicts that radio emission should eventually follow, produced by ejected electrons whirling around ambient magnetic fields, and that’s just what astronomers detected two years later. Astronomers had never seen such radio waves from a Type Ia supernova before.  ""It's the first time that the radio detection allowed us to confirm the presence of the circumstellar medium,"" says Erik Kool (Stockholm University, Sweden), who led the study. The radio data showed dense gas far away from the exploding white dwarf, as expected if the companion was a normal star. The visible-light spectrum also revealed a lot of helium in the surrounding gas, suggesting that the companion was a helium star that had lost much of its material just before the white dwarf's explosion.  This animation of the SN 2020eyj explosion shows the white dwarf initially pulling gas from a helium star. When the white dwarf's mass reaches critical mass, it explodes. The ejected material collides with circumstellar material, which begins to shine in radio.  Adam Makarenko / W. M. Keck Observatory  Ruiter says that the authors' argument, at face value, seems quite strong. “Type Ia supernovae involving a helium-rich donor are predicted from population synthesis,” says Ruiter. Her own simulations predicted that this scenario would account for only 10% of all single-degenerate formation channels, so it’s a rare find  Then again, SN 2020eyj was already faint when it started behaving strangely, so astronomers may have missed the similar, more distant explosions. To catch more single-degenerate cases, astronomers have to find a way to recognize such events early on.

Another of the two-door sports cars suffered engine failure at a track day event, and the automaker has refused to repair the vehicle under warranty. The car's owner, who prefers to go by just Luke, said a local Toyota dealership in Massachusetts and the manufacturer refused to cover his failed engine, and said it was abused on track. Luke has a video of his warmup laps when the failure happened. You can decide for yourself whether what you see is abuse.  The failure occurred Sunday at Palmer Motorsports Park, about an hour west of Boston. Luke signed up for an HPD session that day with his 2022 GR86, and although he had heard of Blake Alvarado's situation, which we covered last year, he wasn't worried. ""I had heard of the RTV issues but generally [thought] that the issue was likely overblown."" RTV, a gasket material used in the Subaru engines, has been found in the lubrication systems of several vehicles. Owners have claimed the substance is to blame for the failures, but neither Toyota nor Subaru has publicly addressed the alleged issue.  About five minutes after Luke's lap began, he felt something was wrong. ""Initially [I] thought a fender liner or something had come loose and was knocking against the tire, as I had a helmet on, and wasn't really expecting engine failure during warmup,"" he told us. ""Eventually, it got really loud and I pulled over as shown."" By seven minutes into the video, his car was knocking badly and he stopped trackside in a cloud of smoke.  Luke's 2022 GR86 only has around 19,000 miles on the odometer. Whether he was racing or abusing the car, as he claims Toyota Corporate says he was, is up to you. We reached out to the automaker for comment on Luke's situation but haven't heard back. We'll update this story if we do.  Soon after the vehicle was cleared from the track, he took it to Acton Toyota in Littleton, Massachusetts, and left the keys in the drop box, as the dealership was closed for the weekend. When he spoke to someone at the dealer the next morning, Luke said he told them what happened and noted he had a video of what happened. After an inspection, a hole was found in the top of the engine block. Luke says it's unclear whether the oil pan was checked for any loose RTV. The dealer told him the damage would not be covered under warranty due to track use, even after seeing the video embedded above.  Luke escalated his problem to Toyota, but he got effectively the same response. ""[An agent] asks what dealer I have the car at. I tell her and she calls the dealer, then gets back to me saying that the dealer is correct and I will not receive any warranty coverage."" He continued to try to resolve the situation, even offering to send the video, but with no luck. ""I demand to know why they refuse to warranty and they again state something about 'the nature in which the vehicle was being used.' The corporate person tried to say I was racing briefly as well.""  ___lunk via Instagram  Competition use is covered explicitly under warranty for Toyota's GR-branded vehicles abroad but not in the United States. That's despite the automaker offering its own track day events called the ""Toyota Saturday GR Track Experience,"" which features the GR86. Indeed, Toyota seems particularly stingy about engine replacements, whereas Subaru, which makes the effectively identical BRZ, is reportedly much more willing to cover failures.

In a preview clip for the upcoming season reunion released Tuesday, Andy Cohen asks Giudice if she believes Joe’s wife, Melisssa Gorga, was the one to call the FBI and “put her in jail” in 2015 over fraud charges.  “I spoke to the FBI because of what you’ve done,” Guidice, 51, says while pointing her finger at her sister-in-law. However, it’s unclear what Melissa had exactly “done.”  Joe — who has remained faithfully by his wife’s side amid her feud with Giudice — asks his sister, “Oh, what, are you threatening me?” to which she quips, “I’m speaking the truth.”  “The Amusing World of Joe Gorga” comedian refutes her, saying that it’s all “a lie.”  Teresa Giudice and Luis Ruelas faced Joe and Melisa Gorga for the first time since the end of Season 13 during the reunion.  Giudice dubbed her brother as “disgraceful” after she burst out in tears.  He adds, “You broke my heart a long time ago.”  His attitude seemingly pushes Giudice to tears, who yells, “This is disgraceful. You should be ashamed of yourself!”  The OG of Jersey then gets up from her spot on the couch and storms off, screaming at her brother while her husband, Luis Ruelas, runs after her, “And don’t come following me!”  Giudice’s feud with her brother caused her to storm out of the reunion.  “You should be ashamed of yourself! And don’t come following me!” Giudice yelled at her brother.  Earlier in the trailer, Cohen asks Ruelas why he had hired private security — who were trying to access the Bravo studio where the reunion was being filmed — and a private investigator.  “Because we got death threats last week, Andy,” Ruelas explains, which had Melissa responding, “Oh, dear God, we are at delusionals like highest level.”  For more Page Six reality TV updates  Her statement further set off Giudice, who tells her, “I can’t wait to never look at your face again after today. You’re leaving.” (Melissa has shut down rumors that she is leaving “RHONJ.”)  The Gorgas feud with Giudice and Ruelas reached an all-time high during the reunion following an explosive Season 13.  The Gorgas feud with Giudice and Ruelas reached an all-time low during Season 13. melissagorga/Instagram  After years of feuding, things got worse between the family members when Giudice brought up a rumor claiming that Melissa had cheated on Joe. This caused Melissa and Joe to ultimately skip Giudice’s wedding to Ruelas.  Multiple sources had previously told Page Six that Giudice was “completely unhinged” and “out of control” while filming with her castmates.  We were told the mother of four seemed “very unhappy” and “mad at the world,” which caused Cohen to be “frustrated with her the entire time.” The Bravo executive producer also admitted to walking out on the reunion after he “lost [his] s–t.”  Giudice had brought up rumors that Melissa had cheated on Joe.  Sources had previously told Page Six that Giudice was “nastier” than ever during the reunion.  However, one insider insisted that she only got worked up when the topic of her “family dynamics” was brought up.  “This was the first time Teresa, Melissa and Joe were gonna see each other in person,” the insider said, emphasizing the trio’s “long history” of “deep-rooted family issues.”  The insider believed Giudice acted out because she was “hurt” but admitted that “her same energy was not necessarily matched” by her sister-in-law.  Following the explosive reunion, Page Six learned that “RHONJ” was put on pause.  Melissa and Joe have cut off all communication with Giudice and Ruelas.

"explosion","2023-05-22","09:30:00","{""Washington"", ""DistrictOfColumbia"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T15:01:55","An image of black smoke billowing next to a bureaucratic-looking building spread across social media Monday morning, with the claim that it showed an explosion near the Pentagon.  The posts sent a brief shiver through the stock market and were quickly picked up by news outlets outside the U.S., before officials jumped in to clarify that no blast actually took place and the photo was a fake.  Experts say the viral image had telltale signs of an AI-generated forgery, and its popularity underscores the everyday chaos these now increasingly sophisticated and easy-to-access programs can inflict.  Here's a closer look at the facts.  CLAIM: An image shows an explosion near the Pentagon.  THE FACTS: Police and fire officials in Arlington, Virginia, say the image is not real and there was no incident at the U.S. Department of Defense headquarters across the Potomac from the nation's capital.  Despite this, the image and claim was spread by outlets including RT, a Russian government-backed media company formerly known as Russia Today. It was also widely shared in investment circles, including an account bearing Twitter's signature blue verification check mark that falsely suggested it was associated with Bloomberg News.  ""Reports of an explosion near the Pentagon in Washington DC,"" the Russian state news agency wrote in a since-deleted tweet to its more than three million followers.  The timing of the fake image, which appeared to spread widely just after the U.S. stock market opened for trading at 9:30 a.m., was enough to send a ripple through the investment world.  The S&P 500 briefly dropped a modest 0.3% as social media accounts and investment websites popular with day traders repeated the false claims.  Other investments also moved in ways that typically occur when fear enters the market. Prices for U.S. Treasury bonds and gold, for example, briefly began to climb, suggesting investors were looking for someplace safer to park their money.  The image's rapid spread prompted the Arlington County Fire Department to take to social media to knock down the rumors.  ""@PFPAOfficial and the ACFD are aware of a social media report circulating online about an explosion near the Pentagon,"" the agency wrote, referring to the acronym for the Pentagon Force Protection Agency that polices the Pentagon. ""There is NO explosion or incident taking place at or near the Pentagon reservation, and there is no immediate danger or hazards to the public.""  Capt. Nate Hiner, a spokesperson for the fire department, confirmed the agency's tweet was authentic but declined to comment further, deferring to the Pentagon police force, which didn't respond to email and phone messages.  Misinformation experts say the fake image was likely created using generative artificial intelligence programs, which have allowed increasingly realistic, but oftentimes flawed, visuals to flood the internet recently.  Inconsistencies in the building, fence and surrounding area are imperfections typically found in AI-generated images, noted Hany Farid, a computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who specializes in digital forensics, misinformation and image analysis.  ""Specifically, the grass and concrete fade into each other, the fence is irregular, there is a strange black pole that is protruding out of the front of the sidewalk but is also part of the fence,"" he wrote in an email. ""The windows in the building are inconsistent with photos of the Pentagon that you can find online.""  Chirag Shah, co-director of the Center for Responsibility in AI Systems & Experiences at the University of Washington in Seattle, cautioned that spotting fakes won't always be as obvious.  Society will need to lean more on ""crowdsourcing and community vigilance to weed out bad information and arrive at the truth"" as AI technology improves, he argued.  ""Simply relying on detection tools or social media posts are not going to be enough,"" Shah wrote in an email.  Before the explosion hoax, the biggest Beltway intrigue on Wall Street's mind Monday morning was whether the U.S. government will avoid a disastrous default on its debt.  But as the market is becoming increasingly reactive to headline-grabbing news, misinformation can be especially damaging when it's shared by outlets even vaguely deemed as credible, said Adam Kobeissi, editor-in-chief at The Kobeissi Letter, an industry publication.  ""A lot of these moves are happening because of high frequency trading, algorithmic trading, which is basically taking headlines, synthesizing them and then breaking them down into a trade on a millisecond basis,"" he explained by phone, noting that much of the market is now automated. ""It's basically like you're pulling a trigger every time a headline comes out.""  ----  Associated Press business reporters Stan Choe and Wyatte Grantham-Philips in New York contributed to this story.  ------  This is part of AP's effort to address widely shared misinformation, including work with outside companies and organizations to add factual context to misleading content that is circulating online.

Videos taken by residents show a large fire broke out, which the MEN understands started in a caravan.  A spokesperson for the fire service has since confirmed the fire involved a property, an outbuilding, a car, and a caravan. Residents also reported a ‘gas explosion’.  READ MORE: Join the FREE Manchester Evening News WhatsApp community  “We just saw the smoke,” Yvonne Errock, a Montgomery Street resident for 40 years, said.  “We came outside and saw the fence was on fire. There was an explosion, too.  “The gas cylinder in the caravan exploded. The fire brigade came and I rang the owner of the property. It’s empty. It was up for sale and it’s been sold now.”  Another resident, who asked to stay anonymous, added: “We saw smoke everywhere, even at the back of the house. I rang 999. We went out and moved our cars then.  “The owner has a caravan. It’s an older guy, and the police told us to get out because of the gas cylinder.”  The incident sparked a big police and fire service presence, with six cop cars and three fire engines present at its height.  A spokesperson for Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) said: “Just before 9.30am this morning, three fire engines from Oldham central, Chadderton and Blackley fire station along with the Technical Response Unit from Ashton were called to reports of building fire involving a property on Montgomery Street, Oldham.

Firefighters wearing breathing apparatuses are using four hose reels to extinguish the fire.  “Some neighbouring properties have been evacuated as a precaution. Firefighters have been in attendance for around an hour and fifty minutes and are still at the scene.”  No injuries have been recorded so far, they added. The incident is very out of keeping, according to Yvonne.  She went on: “It’s a lovely street, it’s a real community, we saw the smoke and rushed out straight away.  “We have a little message group and if anything goes on we put it in there.

(WCSC) - Residents across the Lowcountry say they felt or heard what they call a “big boom” Tuesday morning as Joint Base Charleston continues scheduled explosive operations on the Cooper River.  Twitter user Brandon Walker posted video of a Nest doorbell camera that captured the sound of the boom.  While Joint Base Charleston has not yet responded to a request for comment, the base sent out an alert warning of “explosive operations” at Wharf Alpha on the Cooper River in Goose Creek. Those operations began on Monday and are expected to continue through Sunday.  The South Carolina Emergency Management Division said Tuesday morning it has no reports of any earthquakes and they are also working to determine the source of the boom.  The U.S. Geological Survey says some small, shallow earthquakes too small to be recorded can be experienced as booms to people close enough to feel the quake.  Mount Pleasant Police posted on their Twitter account at 8:51 a.m. that they had received reports and that their officers were patrolling.  Reports of a loud noise across town. Officers are patrolling.

Reports of the boom came in from downtown Charleston, Mount Pleasant, West Ashley, Daniel Island, Moncks Corner, Folly Beach, James Island, Wadmalaw Island and others.  But some in those same areas said they neither felt nor heard anything.  Big booms are not uncommon in the area thanks to the large military presence.  Residents in Goose Creek reported loud booms back in 2015 that were traced to military ordnance operations at the Naval Weapons Station.  A few months later, a loud boom was caught on camera during a June 15, 2015, news conference in downtown Charleston. As members of the NAACP spoke outside the Charleston County School District, cameras recorded the sound at approximately 11:45 a.m. as a jet flew over the area.  Joint Base Charleston said at that time jets were conducting training in the area, but could not confirm the sound was actually a sonic boom linked to that training.  Just last month, a sonic boom believed to have been caused by a meteor alarmed residents in Indiana. As one Westfield, Indiana resident’s home security system picked up a bright light flying across the sky, the sound followed.  The U.S. Air Force says a sonic boom is an impulsive noise similar to thunder caused by an object moving faster than sound.  “As an aircraft flies at supersonic speeds it is continually generating shock waves, dropping sonic boom along its flight path, similar to someone dropping objects from a moving vehicle,” its website states. “The sound heard on the ground as a ‘sonic boom’ is the sudden onset and release of pressure after the buildup by the shock wave or ‘peak overpressure.’”  Joint Base Charleston has not yet responded to a request for information about the sound.

Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine. ArrowRight In a hearing held by North Rhine-Westphalia’s Interior Affairs Committee on Monday, regional Interior Minister Herbert Reul revealed the details of a May 11 incident in the western German city of Ratingen that involved rescue workers and armed police units and left 35 people injured. Three rescue workers are still in a life-threatening condition and five others are being treated for serious injuries.  Police went to the 10th-floor apartment after being contacted by the building manager, who said that the 91-year-old tenant had not been seen in some time and that her mailbox was overflowing. Police said it was assumed there was a “helpless person” inside in need of aid.  After finding the door blocked by cases of bottled water, police smashed a glass pane in the door, cleared the obstruction and entered the apartment where they saw the man, 57, who turned out to be the tenant’s son.  According to authorities, one of the officers drew a sidearm and told the man to lie on the ground, but the man responded by spraying the officers with a flammable liquid — possibly gasoline — and setting them alight. The man then fled to the apartment’s balcony.  “Emergency and rescue services, some of whom were still burning, ran from the 10th floor to the street,” Reul told the committee. The police officer who first entered the apartment suffered burns on 80 percent of her upper body, the regional Justice Ministry said.  Advertisement  In a subsequent search of the apartment, investigators found the severely decomposed remains of a woman in a wheelchair. “It could be the 91-year-old mother of the accused. An autopsy on her body revealed no signs of trauma other than a fracture in her lumbar vertebrae. It was probably a natural death,” the ministry official told the committee. The identity is still to be confirmed via a DNA sample.  A 73-year-old man also was found dead in another apartment in the building. It was not clear whether the cases were connected, and investigations of both deaths were opened.  The suspect had a criminal record consisting of minor assault charges in disputes with neighbors and had been fined three times but did not pay the fines. An arrest warrant was issued for him in March, but no one answered the door when police went to inform him of it. A note was left for him in the mailbox.  After the discovery of documents criticizing coronavirus vaccinations and a large supply of food with distant expiration dates, police concluded that the suspect could be part of the anti-vaccine scene and one of those preparing for some kind of doomsday catastrophe.  Authorities said there was no indication that the suspect’s attack was politically motivated or that there was any connection to the extremist Reichsbürger case, an alleged far-right conspiracy to overthrow the state that made headlines in Germany last year.

The explosion went off in Daynile District of Mogadishu, the Ministry of Defence confirmed. This is the first major explosion in the capital in as many months which has been relatively safe following the deployment of Uganda-trained soldiers who were dispatched to the capital recently.  Brigadier General Abdullahi Ali Anod, the ministry's spokesperson, said that the attack occurred at about 9 a.m. and that three soldiers and an officer with the construction unit had been killed. He affirmed that security is tight in Mogadishu despite the unfortunate explosion.  Somalia-based Al-Shabaab militants claimed responsibility for the attack but did not reveal the immediate target. Since the government launched an offensive against Al-Shabaab, the number of explosions through Improvised Explosive Devices [IEDs] has significantly reduced, he added.  ""We are not saying the explosions stopped, but we are saying they weakened,"" Anod said. He added that the government had been expecting a rise in attacks during the month of Ramadan, but that did not happen.  ""The enemy is wounded, but they can still fire bullets,"" he said.  The US Africa Command confirmed on Monday that it had targeted Jilib town, the headquarters of Al-Shabaab but did not give further details. This comes a few hours after the group released a video purportedly of their leader Abu Ubaidah, whose whereabouts remain unknown.  A joint report by the United Nations Assistance Mission in Somalia and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said 109 IED attacks from January 2020 to December 2021 killed 309 civilians and injured 556 others.  Somalia is set to start the second phase of operations against Al-Shabaab in the coming weeks, with Mogadishu already asking for assistance from neighboring countries. Already, Kenya, Ethiopia, and Djibouti have pledged to initiate the fight against Al-Shabaab with non-ATMIS troops as a show of solidarity with the country.

Their achievement improves understanding of stellar processes generating diverse nuclear isotopes.  ""Neutron stars are really fascinating from the points of view of both nuclear physics and astrophysics,"" said ORNL nuclear astrophysicist Kelly Chipps, who led a study published in Physical Review Letters. ""A deeper understanding of their dynamics may help reveal the cosmic recipes of elements in everything from people to planets.""  Chipps heads the Jet Experiments in Nuclear Structure and Astrophysics, or JENSA, which has collaborators from nine institutions in three countries. The team uses a unique gas jet target system, which produces the world's highest-density helium jet for accelerator experiments, to understand nuclear reactions that proceed with the same physics on Earth as in outer space.  The process of nucleosynthesis creates new atomic nuclei. One element can turn into another when protons or neutrons are captured, exchanged or expelled.  A neutron star has an immense gravitational pull that can capture hydrogen and helium from a nearby star. The material amasses on the neutron star surface until it ignites in repeated explosions that create new chemical elements.  Many nuclear reactions powering the explosions remain unstudied. Now, JENSA collaborators have produced one of these signature nuclear reactions in a lab at Michigan State University. It directly constrains the theoretical model typically used to predict element formation and improves understanding of the stellar dynamics that generate isotopes.  Built at ORNL and now at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams, a DOE Office of Science user facility that MSU operates, the JENSA system provides a target of lightweight gas that is dense, pure and localized within a couple millimeters. JENSA will also provide the primary target for the Separator for Capture Reactions, or SECAR, a detector system at FRIB that allows experimental nuclear astrophysicists to directly measure the reactions that power exploding stars. Co-author Michael Smith of ORNL and Chipps are members of SECAR's project team.  For the current experiment, the scientists struck a target of alpha particles (helium-4 nuclei) with a beam of argon-34. (The number after an isotope indicates its total number of protons and neutrons.) The result of that fusion produced calcium-38 nuclei, which have 20 protons and 18 neutrons. Because those nuclei were excited, they ejected protons and ended up as potassium-37 nuclei.  High-resolution charged-particle detectors surrounding the gas jet precisely measured energies and angles of the proton reaction products. The measurement took advantage of detectors and electronics developed at ORNL under the leadership of nuclear physicist Steven Pain. Accounting for the conservation of energy and momentum, the physicists back-calculated to discover the dynamics of the reaction.  ""Not only do we know how many reactions occurred, but also we know the specific energy that the final potassium-37nucleus ended up in, which is one of the components predicted by the theoretical model,"" Chipps said.  The lab experiment improves understanding of nuclear reactions that occur when material falls onto the surface of an important subset of neutron stars. These stars are born when a massive star runs out of fuel and collapses into a sphere about as wide as a city such as Atlanta, Georgia. Then gravity squeezes fundamental particles as close together as they can get, creating the densest matter we can directly observe. One teaspoon of neutron star would weigh as much as a mountain. Neutron-packed stars rotate faster than blender blades and make the universe's strongest magnets. They have solid crusts surrounding liquid cores containing material shaped like spaghetti or lasagna noodles, earning them the nickname ""nuclear pasta.""  ""Because neutron stars are so weird, they are a useful naturally occurring laboratory to test how neutron matter behaves under extreme conditions,"" Chipps said.  Achieving that understanding takes teamwork. Astronomers observe the star and collect data. Theoreticians try to understand physics inside the star. Nuclear physicists measure nuclear reactions in the lab and test them against models and simulations. That analysis reduces large uncertainties resulting from a dearth of experimental data. ""When you put all of those things together, you really start to understand what's happening,"" Chipps said.  ""Because the neutron star is superdense, its huge gravity can pull hydrogen and helium over from a companion star. As this material falls to the surface, the density and temperature grow so high that a thermonuclear explosion can occur that can propagate across the surface,"" Chipps said. Thermonuclear runaway transforms nuclei into heavier elements. ""The reaction sequence can produce dozens of elements.""  Surface explosions do not destroy the neutron star, which goes right back to what it was doing before: feeding off its companion and exploding. Repeated explosions pull crust material into the mix, creating a bizarre composition in which heavy elements formed during previous explosions react with lightweight hydrogen and helium.  Theoretical models predict which elements form. Scientists typically analyze the reaction that the JENSA team measured using a statistical theoretical model called the Hauser-Feshbach formalism, which assumes that a continuum of excited energy levels of a nucleus can participate in a reaction. Other models instead assume that only a single energy level participates.  ""We're testing the transition between the statistical model being valid or invalid,"" Chipps said. ""We want to understand where that transition happens. Because Hauser-Feshbach is a statistical formalism -- it relies on having a large number of energy levels so effects over each individual level are averaged out -- we're looking for where that assumption starts to break down. For nuclei like magnesium-22 and argon-34, there's an expectation that the nucleus doesn't have enough levels for this averaging approach to be valid. We wanted to test that.""  A question remained about whether the statistical model was valid for such reactions taking place in stars rather than earthly laboratories. ""Our result has shown that the statistical model is valid for this particular reaction, and that removes a tremendous uncertainty from our understanding of neutron stars,"" Chipps said. ""It means that we now have a better grasp of how those nuclear reactions are proceeding.""  Next, the researchers will try to improve the statistical model by further testing its limits. A past paper explored atomic mass 22, a magnesium nucleus, and found the model incorrect by almost a factor of 10. The current ORNL-led paper, probing 12 atomic mass units above this, found that the model correctly predicted reaction rates.  ""Somewhere between [atomic] mass 20 and 30, this transition between where the statistical model is valid and where it's not valid is taking place,"" Chipps said. ""The next thing is to look for reactions in the middle of that range to see where this transition is occurring."" Chipps and her JENSA collaborators have begun that endeavor.  The title of the paper is ""First direct measurement of the 34Ar(α,p)37K reaction cross section for mixed hydrogen and helium burning in accreting neutron stars.""  DOE's Office of Science, the National Science Foundation and ORNL's Laboratory Directed Research and Development program supported the work.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkYWlseS5jb20vcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy8wNS8yMzA1MjMxMjM2NDAuaHRt0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(Photo: US Department of Defense)  By Bidisha Saha: One fake AI image has seemed to cause speculations in the stock market, fool TV channels and made headlines on a flurry of misinformation. But, how did the whammy attempt by some novice get on to become international headlines and what are the lessons to be learned from this?  The ambiguity around applications of Twitter Blue service, the increasing sophistication of AI images and the lack of regulation around disinformation have all contributed to creating a cocktail of an epic specimen of online forgery.  Read More  On Monday, a fake image purporting to show an explosion near a bureaucratic-looking building which is claimed to be the United States Department of Defense (DoD) headquarters or Pentagon, was shared by multiple verified Twitter accounts.    The said image bears clear indicators of being AI-generated and was shared by numerous verified accounts with blue check marks, including one that falsely claimed it was associated with Bloomberg News.    The image of plumes of black smoke billowing from the garden near the Pentagon building was created artificially and was reposted by the Twitter blue account with the name ‘Bloomberg Feed’. This created the impression that one of the mainstream US-based news portals has verified the legitimacy of the incident which in fact was a fake handle. The Twitter account has now been suspended.  ALSO READ | Man spreads fake news about train crash using ChatGPT, gets arrested  HOW TRUE IS TWITTER BLUE?  Under its new owner, Elon Musk, Twitter has allowed paid subscriptions for anyone to obtain a verified account in exchange for a monthly charge. As a result, Twitter verification is no longer an indicator of a legacy account representing who it claims to represent.  The incident also highlighted the verification challenges on Twitter, since the platform introduced its subscription service on November 2022. Under the new Twitter Blue program rolled out last month, individuals can pay $8 a month for a blue check mark.  Concerns about accounts impersonating public figures, government officials and news sites have grown since the change.  Elon Musk also mentioned that the Twitter Blue accounts will be given more visibility in feeds and timelines, thereby suppressing those who have not subscribed to Twitter Blue.  ALSO READ | Fact Check: No, Elon Musk never tweeted that ex-Pak PM Imran Khan has most ‘fake’ Twitter followers  Under the new verification regime, an individual or a network (government or non-governmental agency) can launch a coordinated attack on other entities or a misinformation campaign and might end up receiving more impressions.  It is also worth noting that the official account for the Pentagon Force Protection Agency, which actually polices the Pentagon, doesn’t pay for a blue check mark, and Twitter has not given it a grey check mark (which is the now indicator of a verified institution).  The agency retweeted a message saying there was “NO explosion” at 10:27 AM, which garnered only 78,000 views.  But interestingly, another paid account on Twitter with blue “verified” check marks had over 341.7k views. Blue ticks are now given to independent users, while there’s a yellow check mark for organisations.    OSINTdefender, a Twitter page that shares news about international military conflicts and boasts over 336,000 followers, was also one of the verified pages that shared the photo.  The page later apologized for spreading misinformation and said the incident was an example of how “easily these sorts of images can be used to manipulate the information space and how dangerous this could be in the future”.    HOW TO IDENTIFY FAKE AI IMAGES  Bellingcat researcher Nick Waters was among the early accounts that recognized the image being AI-generated. In his tweet, he outlined some indicators which can be used to check the authenticity of the images online while also stressing the importance of taking a hard look at the content we see online.  The ‘unusual’ melding of the fence of the building into the crowd barriers showed that the image could have been artificially made or manipulated.  ALSO READ | On new Bing, Indians are the top makers of fake AI images  Next, for an event of such hyperlocal importance, it is eminent that there would be first-hand witnesses or chatter accounts that would immediately take on Twitter to share different angles of the explosion site. Also, a simple geolocation of the site of attack can reveal facts that help in distinguishing real images from fake ones.  The structure in the image shared online does not appear to resemble the exterior of the Defense Department headquarters, which is a massive five-sided building.  Some even reposted the tweet claiming that the building is the US Presidents' residence, the White House but the structure of the said image bears no resemblance to it.  Earth TV, which provides a live stream of webcam footage of the exterior of Washington’s most protected areas including The White House also confirmed that there is no smoke outside the building.  The false visuals of the explosion also made their way to the air of a few major Indian channels. However, they later retracted the report when it became clear the incident had not taken place.  Among the international news websites, Russian state-controlled news networks Russia Today and Zero Hedge also tweeted images from their social media handles.    The original source of the image is not traceable at this moment but an AFP tweet claimed that the Pentagon image came from ""CBKNEWS,"" a QAnon account that has been previously known to share disinformation.  QAnon accounts are anonymous web pages that share content which is unverified and insider conspiracy theories about Washington and the Trump administration.  The fire department in Arlington, Virginia, later responded in a tweet, stating that it and the Pentagon Force Protection Agency were “aware of a social media report circulating online about an explosion near the Pentagon. There is NO explosion or incident taking place at or near the Pentagon reservation, and there is no immediate danger or hazards to the public.”  The US Department of Defense has also confirmed that the image was fake later with a tweet.

The reason for the fire is yet to be confirmed but illegal stocks of carbide and firecrackers discovered in a congested space have raised several questions.The sound of an explosion shook Rathbari around 6.30am; this was immediately followed by the noise of several crackers bursting. Onlookers rushed to the spot to find a corner of Netaji Market ablaze, with thick smoke filling the air. According to locals, drums of carbide - usually used to ripen mangoes - were being unloaded from a lorry into a godown. One of these reportedly slipped from the hands of a worker, causing the blast. Adjacent to the carbide godown, there were shops and storehouses of firecrackers, which were set alight instantly. A tin roof covering a passage to the market was blown off.Local Trinamool leader Ashis Kundu, among the first to reach the spot, called the fire brigade, which arrived within minutes. But the narrow space stopped fire engines from being able to get to the fire at once. The carbide smoke also made it difficult to enter the area, with at least two firefighters reportedly falling ill.Water, which was being used to douse the cracker shop, caused a chemical reaction in the carbide. Divisional fire officer Swapan Das, who was at the spot, said: ""We used sand to control the carbide blaze.""Malda Merchant Chamber of Commerce (MMCC), English Bazar Municipality officials as well as police also rushed to the scene.While tackling the blaze in the firecracker units, the charred bodies of two workers were discovered. Mangal Rishi (45) and Ganesh Karmakar (40) were declared brought dead at Malda Medical College and Hospital. They were both employed to unload goods at the market and it is believed they were carrying the carbide drums in the morning. Another worker is in hospital with grave injuries.The owner of the go-down, Somnath Saha, was not present but questions have been raised over the stocking of so much carbide and firecrackers in such a small place with no safety measures.TMC leader Kundu said: ""If the blaze had occurred during working hours instead of early in the morning, many more lives would have been lost.""Jayanta Kundu, secretary of MMCC, said: ""We stand by the families of the deceased and the traders who suffered losses in this fire.""BJP leader Amlan Bhaduri, who also went to the site, said: ""Illegal hoarding of firecrackers and carbide is going on just metres from a police outpost and the municipality.

In a geological blink of an eye, life transformed from simple, soft-bodied organisms to complex, multicellular organisms with shells and skeletons. Now, a study conducted by researchers from the University of Cambridge has shown that the diversity of the animal world during this period also led to a drastic change in the chemistry of Earth's crust – the outer layer of the geosphere that supports and sustains everything on the planet and provides many essential materials for life.  << Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter >>  Other stories:  The researchers identified that following the Cambrian explosion – a term that describes a dramatic change in the rate of species diversification in bilaterians (organisms with bilateral symmetry as an embryo) on Earth – the quantities of zinc, considered a life-bolstering substance, tripled in Earth's crust, supporting the expansion of life on the planet.  2 View gallery The subterranean world during the Cambrian period ( Photo: Shutterstock )  Using a database of information on ancient rocks compiled by scientists worldwide, the researchers constructed a map to demonstrate how the chemistry of Earth's crust changed over the past 3 billion years. They discovered that due to the rise in zinc during the Cambrian explosion the content of this key nutrient in Earth's crust rocks continued to increase until today.  Life in all its forms, from the great whale to the tiny plankton, relies on several key components: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur. The researchers chose to focus on phosphorus in their study, because it is not only universally essential for life but also difficult to access due to its confinement within minerals in Earth's crust. Mapping the distribution of phosphorus in Earth's crust rocks over time allows us to identify how much of this essential element is available for supporting life and, in a broader perspective, gain an understanding of the extent of life present on the planet.  As opposed to carbon and nitrogen, which are central components in Earth's atmosphere, phosphorus must be extracted from rocks before it can be utilized. The process begins with the weathering of rocks due to interactions with rainwater, releasing phosphate that is subsequently carried by rivers into the oceans. Once in the oceans, phosphorus undergoes a process of chemical exchange facilitated by organisms such as plankton and algae, which are then consumed by larger organisms higher up in the food chain. When these organisms die, most of the phosphorus is recycled back into the ocean waters. This efficient recycling process serves as a central control on the total amount of phosphorus present in the oceans, which in turn supports the existence of marine life.  2 View gallery Paradoxides creature, measuring 30 cm in length, which lived during the middle of the Cambrian period ( Photo: Sedgwick Museum )  Additionally, this entire biological process relies on oxygen, which fuels the bacteria responsible for decomposing organic matter and returning phosphorus back to the oceans. The researchers speculated that a spike in oxygen levels around the time of the Cambrian explosion may explain the increase in phosphorus content in rocks. The transfer of phosphorus back toward land meant that it was better preserved in rocks forming the continents.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnluZXRuZXdzLmNvbS9oZWFsdGhfc2NpZW5jZS9hcnRpY2xlL3JrcXVzZWZyMtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Beirut’s largest and oldest private cultural institution, the Sursock Museum will reopen on May 26 following nearly three years of repairs and restoration to its building and collections, which were devastated by a massive port explosion on August 4, 2020.  Through generous support from the International Alliance for the Protection of Heritage in Conflict Areas (ALIPH), the French Ministry of Culture, and a donation from the Italian Government under UNESCO's LiBeirut grant, the Sursock Museum succeeded in raising nearly USD 2.4 million (as of 2021) to complete restoration work within two years. Its colorful glass windows have been recreated and hand-carved Damascus woodwork reinstalled. Additionally, all 50 damaged artworks in its galleries have been repaired. The museum’s rehabilitation goes beyond celebrating its restored facade, however. Director Karina El Helou noted, “It has been a collective healing process to see the museum rising from its ashes,” reflecting the cathartic journey undertaken by Lebanon’s larger cultural community since the unfortunate tragedy.  The museum was damaged in a major catastrophe for the city of Beirut. On August 4, 2020, a huge store of ammonium nitrate at a warehouse in the Port of Beirut was ignited by a fire, causing a massive explosion that sent shockwaves throughout the city and its environs. Considered one of the most powerful, artificial non-nuclear explosions in history, the 3.3-magnitude blast caused a death toll of at least 218 pople, displaced approximately 300,000 residents, and amassed a totaled USD 15 billion in property damage. Many cultural organizations and galleries suffered causalities and damage, with the Sursock Museum numbering among those sustaining the most critical damage. The Museum’s iconic glass-stained windows were completely shattered in the blast due to their direct, port-facing position. Its precious painting collection was also ripped from its walls, defaced by broken glass and twisted metal.  Established on the grounds of a private villa owned by Lebanese collector Nicolas Ibrahim Sursock and later bequeathed to the city, the Sursock Museum is one of few extant hallmarks of early 20th-century Lebanese architecture today. The building’s design is particularly unique in its Venetian-Ottoman influence.  The Sursock Museum’s reopening will feature five exhibitions charting its historical journey to be held within its newly revived exhibition galleries.

Auburn trailed 1-0 in the second and 4-3 in the fourth but clawed back both times to win its ninth straight SEC game and advance to the second round of the tournament.  ""I thought we were a little out of character early,"" said head coach Butch Thompson. ""I didn't like everything. I don't care if it was a ball or strike I just thought our engine was ramped a little too much.""  Missouri struck first, scoring one run in the top of the second, but Auburn responded with three runs in the bottom of the third by way of a bases-loaded walk, Chris Stanfield scoring from third on a fielder's choice and a sacrifice fly from Bryson Ware. Auburn, with all the momentum and a pro-Auburn crowd surrounding it, lost the lead in the top of the fourth however, as Missouri plated four runs.  An error in the outfield by Bobby Peirce allowed Missouri's Trevor Austin to reach second where he later scored off another error from Auburn. Of Missouri's four runs in the inning, only two were earned after Auburn's two errors in the inning.  The Missouri lead did not last half an inning as a Stanfield single scored Caden Green from second. With Stanfield on first and Nate LaRue on third, Cole Foster stepped into the batter's box and delivered a three-run blast over the wall in right field to give Auburn the lead, a lead it did not lose the rest of the game. Foster's home run was his 12th of the season and measured at a projected distance of 416 feet.      DEEP INTO THE NIGHT! ?@Colefoster20 CRUSHES one into the trees!    B4 | Auburn 7, Missouri 4 pic.twitter.com/xExDvXHw3W — Auburn Baseball (@AuburnBaseball) May 24, 2023      Auburn starting pitcher Tommy Vail was pulled after 3.2 innings and replaced by senior Chase Isbell. The Springville, Alabama, native set the tone for an efficient outing from the Auburn bullpen, which only used two pitchers after Vail.  ""I thought Chase Isbell settled the game for us just a little bit and then Cole Foster's home run just really allowed us to exhale and get back to playing our brand of baseball,"" Thompson said.  Isbell pitched three innings of scoreless baseball while giving up three hits and striking out two. Freshman Zach Crotchfelt replaced Isbell and went 2.1 innings and gave up just one hit and struck out four of eight batters faced.  Auburn added insurance late in the game with three more runs in the bottom of the eighth inning, marking three innings where the Tigers scored three or more runs. Peirce doubled after the Missouri center fielder misjudged a fly ball, allowing the ball to land over his head which scored Foster from first.  The lead extended even further when Ware hammered a ball over the left field wall to make it a 10-4 ballgame. Ware's home run brought his tally to 22 on the season, one shy of the Auburn program record for home runs in a season.  Auburn improved to 34-19-1 this season and advanced to the second round of the SEC Tournament while Missouri fell to 30-24 and is eliminated from the tournament. Auburn will play No. 4 seed Vanderbilt on Wednesday, a team it has not faced this season.

He lost both of his legs and suffered burns on 87% of his body from a 2020 explosion in Northwest Baltimore.  James is still alive to share his story three years after his life changed.  “The thought of just life being swept away instantly from you in a blink, it’s horrific,” James told WJZ. “It’s unexplainable. Words can’t describe it. Emotions can’t describe it.”  James’ house exploded on Aug. 10, 2020.  “The tick and the boom and me catapulting in the air,” James said. “The very next thing, my memory still searches for, is me being piled in the rubble, neck high, not knowing what just happened, how it happened or if I am even going to survive.”  Video captured rescuers carefully carrying James’ still-burning body from the rubble.  “Hearing everyone screaming for help, me trying to move my limbs and [I]can’t move from the waist down, arms can barely move.”  James, a father of two, had more than 22 surgeries and a set of prosthetic legs.  James had burns so severe that, at one point, survival was not a viable option.  “God, God, God, not giving up, fighting, just not giving up on family, not giving up on chance, redemption,” James said.  James said that it has been a struggle mentally and physically, but he keeps pushing forward because of his children and his family.

James told WJZ that every time he closes his eyes, he can’t help but get that terrifying image out of his head.  “From not getting sleep, from cold sweats of when you actually do get a blink or hour or two of sleep, from hopping up thinking you’re on fire, still thinking I have my complete limbs and can get out of the bed and just keep falling,” James said.  And sometimes rest, medicine or rehab isn’t the remedy. Sometimes, he just needs a hug.  “I’ll try my best man. I’m fighting,” James said.

Green decided to troll the Boston Celtics and, more specifically, Grant Williams. The Warriors star reacted to Jimmy Butler also digging the 24-year-old after the Miami Heat went up 3-0 in their Eastern Conference finals series with a 128-102 win in Game 3 on Sunday night at Kaseya Center.  Scroll to continue with content Ad ADVERTISEMENT  ""Grant Williams started talking crazy to Jimmy Butler,"" Green said on the latest episode of ""The Draymond Green Show."" ""Grant Williams then got destroyed by Jimmy Butler, not only in Game 2, where he starts talking crazy, but then Jimmy Butler is at you every time you end up on him.  ""It's not ending well for Grant, and you know when you know. It's not going well for something. After the game, Grant started talking about, 'Man, my mom and my daddy taught me to do this, and I can't go back home.' And I'm like, 'My man started talking about the morals and values that he grew up on.' Bro, you just got dropped off by Jimmy Butler.""  While Green did poke fun at Williams, he does state that the Boston forward isn't at fault. The Warriors star notes that the Celtics' star players are supposed to feed off that energy.  ""As much as we all want to blame Grant Williams, that ain't Grant Williams' fault,"" Green continued. ""Like Grant Williams [is] supposed to do that. Your dogs got to come like, 'Hey, feed off that. Let's go.'  Advertisement  ""So when you do that, yeah, you do got to stand on that. And of course, you're going to hear it like, ain't no passes, but you then need [Jayson Tatum] and [Jaylen Brown] to like, 'Come on, now, turn it into gear and cover your man.' And when I saw JB after [Game 3], they asked JB about Grant and poking the bear or whatnot, and he said, 'Next question' to me, I'm like, 'Oh, they done.'  Golden State defeated the Celtics in the 2022 NBA Finals in six games, so there's some animosity from Green toward Boston. Additionally, the veteran big man has had his run-ins with Williams.

"explosion","2019-02-09","08:45:00","{""SanFrancisco"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T22:27:37","When a deadly explosion leveled a house in San Francisco’s Sunset District in February, the flames ripped through two other homes with such ferocity that one family lost nearly all of their belongings.  In a complaint filed Tuesday in San Francisco Superior Court, David Garth and Phoutthasone Phommavongsay accused the property owners at 1734 22nd Ave. of creating conditions that led to the fire, saying the owners knew their tenant had brought in large tanks of chemicals to fuel a hash oil laboratory in the basement and that they did nothing to stop it.  Defendants Peter and Diane De Martini often dropped by to visit tenant Darron Price, the 53-year-old man accused of causing the blast after a clothes dryer sparked butane vapors in his lab, according to the complaint. Yet despite the amount of time that members of the De Martini family spent at 1734 22nd Ave., they neglected to inspect Price’s sprawling operation, which occupied much of the space in his garage, the complaint said.  The conflagration on the morning of Feb. 9 “rocked the normally quiet streets of the Inner Sunset,” the complaint said, killing 51-year-old Rita Price, severely injuring her caretaker and ravaging multiple homes.  Prosecutors charged Darron Price with a raft of crimes, including involuntary manslaughter, manufacturing a controlled substance, reckless burning, child endangerment and elder abuse.  Garth and Phommavongsay lay out an unsettling sequence of events on Feb. 9, saying that Garth left home at 8:45 a.m. to drop Phommavongsay off at work and buy groceries. Minutes later, Garth picked up a Lyft passenger and was driving the person to Oakland when his phone began buzzing — first with text messages about the explosion, then a call from Phommavongsay, who was “hysterically crying” because their home was on fire, the complaint said.  By the time firefighters knocked out the blaze, it had done “tremendous damage,” the complaint said, incinerating family heirlooms, photographs, and a collection of Judaica that Garth sold as a side business. Exhibits included with the lawsuit show the plaintiffs’ charred kitchen, piled in debris.  They are suing for negligence and premises liability, contending the house at 1734 22 Ave. had numerous building, electrical, and construction code violations — a lethal environment for the barrels of combustible substances that Darron Price stocked after he moved there in 2021.  “Allowing a tenant to operate a highly dangerous drug lab in your garage is a ticking time bomb,” said David Hollenberg, an attorney representing the plaintiffs.  Garth and Phommavongsay said they suffered substantial economic losses from the fire, ranging from possessions that were destroyed, to medical expenses, to emotional scars, to loss of income. They seek an undisclosed sum to compensate for these damages.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS9iYXlhcmVhL2FydGljbGUvc3Vuc2V0LWRpc3RyaWN0LWhvbWUtZXhwbG9zaW9uLWxhd3N1aXQtMTgxMTUyOTIucGhw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"explosion","2019-10-16","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-23T15:03:41","When Sir Patrick Moore, the late president of the British Astronomical Association, would step outside on a cold, clear night, he’d look up at the sky and take up his usual vigil.  “I look at Orion before anything else,” he wrote of the constellation, “to make sure that Betelgeuse is still there in its familiar guise!”  Betelgeuse, located on the huntsman’s shoulder, takes its name from an Arabic term that means the “giant’s shoulder,” and the unpredictable supergiant star has always inspired watchfulness. While stars often exude stability for millions of years, this one is notorious for its fits of dimming, brightening, flaring and otherwise puzzling astronomers.  And since Moore died in 2012, things have only gotten worse.  What is Betelgeuse?  Betelgeuse is a massive star, about 700 times the size of the sun. In 2019, a powerful plume rose up from inside it, NASA has hypothesized, and blasted off a chunk of the star’s outer layer.  The ejected material, which weighed several times as much as our moon, cooled out in space, where it blocked light from reaching earth and darkened Moore’s star dramatically in what became known as The Great Dimming. Backyard observers around the world noticed the change, which lasted a few months.  After its dramatic vomiting, Betelgeuse fell into a period of turbulence expected to continue for at least another year or two. Its internal convection cells, which normally drive its characteristic brightening and dimming, are now sloshing around like an unbalanced washing machine, NASA says. On the uppermost level, the scarred surface is bouncing around “like a plate of gelatin dessert.”  The sun has often ejected small amounts of material in a similar fashion, called a coronal mass ejection (CME), but the Betelgeuse belch was 400 billion times larger than the average CME.  Read More: How Old Is the Sun?  When Will Betelgeuse Explode?  In more recent years, the star has traded in its steady, 400-day cycle of glaring and quieting for something much shorter and more spasmodic. Brightening in recent weeks has even raised alarm that the aging star, positioned about 650 light years from Earth, could blast itself apart in a supernova, one of the most violent events in the universe. But scientists have said such an event will probably take another 10,000 to 100,000 years.  When researchers from the Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe, in Japan, analyzed Betelgeuse in 2020, they concluded that the star was still early in its helium-burning phase.  ""Betelgeuse is not at all close to exploding,"" a press release said, and what's more, the star ""is too far from Earth for the eventual explosion to have significant impact here.""  Read More: What Happens When a Star Dies?  Will Betelgeuse Become a Black Hole?  As a massive star, Betelgeuse is expected to go through a dramatic end-of-life catastrophe that will produce either a neutron star or black hole and likely a show for any surviving observers on earth.  Before the catastrophe, Betelgeuse must burn through several different types of nuclear fuel. Starting with hydrogen, which it’s already fused into helium, the fuel for its current stage will make carbon. These reactions release large amounts of energy and send many, many photons out into the universe, including those that reached Moore’s eyes.  Betelgeuse’s next stages will happen quicker as its temperatures rise, sending the star down a slippery slope. Fusion will create oxygen, neon, silicon and finally iron, which accumulates in a huge core.  Read More: This is What a Black Hole Sounds Like  Betelgeuse Star Explosion  Reactions continue, but they sap the star of energy and throw off the balance between expansion and gravitational contraction, causing the star to collapse in on itself and trigger a staggering explosion, a supernova.  As the core collapses, it sends out a shock wave that compresses the surrounding stellar materials, making rare elements such as silver, tin, gold, uranium, mercury and zinc.  The whole process will release 100 times as much energy as our Sun will during its 10-billion-year lifetime and leave behind an exotic remnant, a black hole or neutron star.

The railcar, loaded with more than 60,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate, left Cheyenne, Wyoming on April 12, a Union Pacific spokesperson told USA TODAY Tuesday. Two weeks later it was found empty at a rail stop in the California Mojave Desert, according to a report filed with the federal National Response Center on May 10.  Dyno Nobel said the material, transported in pellet form in a covered hopper car similar to those used to ship coal, likely fell from a rail car on the way to a rail siding (a short track connecting with the main track), about 30 miles from Mojave in Kern County, just east of Bakersfield.  ""The railcar was sealed when it left the Cheyenne facility, and the seals were still intact when it arrived in Saltdale,"" a spokesperson for the company that manufactures explosives told USA TODAY. ""The railcar was also observed after departure in the railroad’s Cheyenne yard with the seals intact and no sign of any leaks.""  ""The initial assessment is that a leak through the bottom gate on the railcar may have developed in transit,"" according to the company, releasing pellets onto the tracks over the two-week trip.  FBI investigating:Border Patrol kills Arizona man who reported migrants on property, family says  In addition to Dyno, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and Union Pacific are investigating the case.  Neither the FRA nor CPUC could immediately be reached by USA TODAY on Tuesday morning.  'Seal still intact'  Officials said the railcar was transported back to Wyoming where it will be inspected.  ""Our review will be exhaustive to understand what led to this situation, but there is no indication of any danger to the public and no indication the pellets were intentionally taken by anyone,"" the Dyno spokesperson said.  ""At this point in the investigation, we do not believe there is any criminal or malicious activity involved,"" said Kristen South, a spokesperson for Union Pacific, who works with its customers to investigate any loss of commodity or damaged freight.  ""Our investigation is in its early stages because the customer recently reported the possible loss of fertilizer from one compartment of a multi-compartment railcar,"" South told USA TODAY Tuesday. ""The fertilizer is designed for ground application and quick soil absorption. If the loss resulted from a railcar leak over the course of transportation from origin to destination, the release should pose no risk to public health or the environment.""  'We don’t seem to learn':10 years after tragic Texas chemical explosion, risk remains high  What is ammonium nitrate?  Ammonium nitrate is explosive under certain conditions. Mixed with something flammable and exposed to flame, it can explode.  Timothy McVeigh used 2 tons of ammonium nitrate mixed with fuel oil to destroy the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, killing 168 people in 1995.  But it's not a danger that exists in many places. That's because the chemical, once a popular fertilizer, is rarely used these days, USA TODAY reported in 2013.  Ammonium nitrate was the main suspected chemical in a Texas explosion that killed 14 people in April 2013.  The explosion at West Fertilizer Co. also injured more than 200 and left at least 50 homes uninhabitable.

The Blue Jays pounded out 27 hits on Tuesday to defeat the Rays 20-1, gaining a split of the first two games of the four-game series.  ""It got a little ugly,"" Rays manager Kevin Cash said.  George Springer finished 4-for-5 with a solo home run, a triple, two RBIs and three runs.  ""It's good to see some positives on our side,"" Springer said. ""It's just a good day. Hopefully spiral into a lot more.""  The Blue Jays scored nine runs and had three home runs in the ninth inning -- including a grand slam by Vladimir Guerrero Jr. that gave him six RBIs for the game -- against two position players. Luke Raley moved from first base in the eighth to pitch 1 2/3 innings, and catcher Christian Bethancourt pitched one-third of an inning.  ""It's not my favorite place to be,"" Raley said. ""I told them before, I got rocked in high school, so I can't imagine what these guys would actually do to me if I tried to pitch. So just try to lob it over the plate and save our bullpen.""  The 19-run margin of defeat was the largest in franchise history. The worst had been a 22-4 defeat to the Boston Red Sox on July 23, 2002.  The Blue Jays are scheduled to start left-hander Yusei Kikuchi (5-1, 4.08 ERA) on Wednesday. In six career games, five starts, against the Rays, he is 4-0 with a 1.80 ERA.  Left-hander Shane McClanahan (7-0, 2.05 ERA) is slated to start for the Rays. In seven career starts against Toronto, McClanahan is 3-2 with a 2.65 ERA.  The Blue Jays broke out on Tuesday after they had lost seven or their previous eight games, including six losses in the final seven games of a 4-6 homestand.  Toronto center fielder Kevin Kiermaier is making his first visit to where he played 10 years for the Rays. The Blue Jays won two of three from the Rays in Toronto last month.  ""I told (the Rays) last year when they didn't sign me, I said, 'I'll make you guys miss me next year. Whether you admit it or not, I'm going to make you guys miss me,' "" Kiermaier said. ""So who knows if they do or not; they're doing just fine without me, so. ...""  Kiermaier is 2-for-8 with one RBI in the first two games of the series.  Rays right-hander Tyler Glasnow (left oblique strain) is set to be activated Saturday and pitch for the first time this season. It is a boost for a rotation that has lost Jeffrey Springs (Tommy John surgery) and Drew Rasmussen (flexor strain) to long-term issues.  ""Regardless of the injuries, I think having Tyler Glasnow back no matter what is important,"" McClanahan said. ""The guy's been busting his butt to get back as soon as he can. We're excited to see what he can do for us and what we know he can do for us.""  Toronto right-hander Adam Cimber (right rhomboid strain) was reinstated from the injured list on Tuesday and pitched a scoreless ninth inning. Infielder Ernie Clement was promoted to the major league roster. Right-hander Thomas Hatch and infielder Otto Lopez were optioned to Triple-A Buffalo, and right-hander Mitch White (right elbow inflammation/right shoulder fatigue) was transferred to the 60-day IL.  --Field Level Media            Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9iYXNlYmFsbC9qYXlzLWFpbS1lbmNvcmUtYWZ0ZXItMjAtcnVuLWV4cGxvc2lvbi12cy1yYXlzLTIwMjMtMDUtMjQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Police say that was a result of someone intentionally blowing up a car in an industrial area just a few feet away from the homes that felt the impact.  “We were just talking in our bedroom upstairs and looking out the window and that’s when we just heard a loud boom,” said Cameron Jones.  He and his siblings were a few of the neighbors who heard and felt that powerful blast outside their home.  “All our neighbors came out talking about it,” said Jones. “One of our brothers thought that it was a firework but me and my oldest brother knew that it had to be something else.”  Milwaukee police and fire were called to the scene just a street away from the Jones family's home.  Police say someone entered the parking lot near multiple industrial businesses and “damaged a vehicle using explosive material."" The FBI is now helping with the investigation. Workers at the scene on Tuesday said the FBI was on the scene all morning trying to piece together what happened.  The fire department also confirmed to TMJ4 that they were called to the scene of an exploded then extinguished car.  Neighbors, like Jones and his siblings, are still shocked by what they heard.  “It was kind of like surprising and had us like confused.”  Milwaukee Police declined an interview the next day citing the ongoing investigation.

Example video title will go here for this video  An image claiming to show an explosion near the Pentagon went viral on May 22, leading some people on social media to panic.  The photo, which was shared by Russian state-controlled news outlet RT and some Twitter users, shows a large column of smoke next to a building that posters claim is the Pentagon complex.  But other people on Twitter claimed the photo isn’t real.  THE QUESTION  Does a viral photo show an explosion at the Pentagon?  THE SOURCES  Arlington County, Virginia, Fire Department  VERIFY image analysis  Siwei Lyu, Ph.D., director of the UB Media Forensic Lab at SUNY Buffalo  Nick Waters, a London-based researcher for the open-source investigative journalism group Bellingcat  Twitter  THE ANSWER  No, a viral photo does not show an explosion at the Pentagon.  WHAT WE FOUND  The viral photo shared on social media does not show an explosion at the Pentagon on Monday, May 22, and appears to be AI-generated, according to local officials and expert analyses of the image.  The Pentagon is located in Arlington County, Virginia, near Washington, D.C. In a tweet on May 22, the Arlington County Fire Department (ACFD) debunked rumors about an explosion at the Pentagon.  “There is no explosion or incident taking place at or near the Pentagon reservation, and there is no immediate danger or hazards to the public,” the ACFD wrote.  There are some visual indicators that the viral image is fake. First, the windows and shape of the building in the viral photo do not match those in photos of the Pentagon available online. Part of a fence also appears to morph into a crowd barrier. That type of unrealistic distortion is often a sign that an image has been generated by AI.  Siwei Lyu, the director of the UB Media Forensic Lab at SUNY Buffalo and a deepfake expert, said his lab ran the image with its algorithm and found that it may have come from a generative AI model.  Several parts of the building, including the windows on the first and second floors, are “irregular and not consistent with real-life buildings,” Lyu said.  He provided the photo below pointing out several irregularities in the fake image:  Nick Waters, a London-based researcher for the open-source investigative journalism group Bellingcat, said in a tweet that he is “confident” the photo is AI-generated.  ""If a bomb goes off in Washington, it's not just going to be one picture from one angle,"" Waters told VERIFY partner station WUSA. ""You're going to get scores and scores of pictures showing the explosion, showing the after-effects of the explosion [and] people saying they saw the explosion.”  Twitter has also labeled other posts sharing the fake image as “manipulated media,” which is a violation of the social media platform’s policy.

All three were severely burned across their body.  According to investigators, the teens: two 17-year-olds and an 18-year-old, were up American Fork Canyon when they doused the Silverlake Flat Reservoir spillway with gasoline and then lit it on fire. That caused a fireball explosion burning the boys.  “They were burned all over. Primarily face arms and maybe legs. And they were driving themselves to the hospital,” Sgt. Spencer Cannon said.  All three students go to Lehi High School. The Alpine school district released a statement stating, “Our thoughts are with these students and their families as they recover.”  Sgt. Cannon says the spillway is about nine feet high and about the same amount wide. “It is horizontal at the top, where the water enters the spillway. It then goes on a downward angle of maybe 45 degrees for approximately 200 feet.”  Sgt. Cannon doesn’t believe there was very much water coming into the spillway or very little water. He says when the boys lit it, “it completely filled that eight or nine-foot rectangle tunnel with flames which came back at them.”  “Whether these young men got gasoline on them and that burned or whether the flames themselves cause the burn injuries the notes say they were burned all over,” he said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8va3NsdHYuY29tLzU1MzA3MS90aHJlZS10ZWVuYWdlcnMtc2V2ZXJlbHktYnVybmVkLWluLWV4cGxvc2lvbi11cC1hbWVyaWNhbi1mb3JrLWNhbnlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The posts sent a brief shiver through the stock market and were quickly picked up by news outlets outside the U.S., before officials jumped in to clarify that no blast actually took place and the photo was a fake.  ADVERTISING  Experts say the viral image had telltale signs of an AI-generated forgery, and its popularity underscores the everyday chaos these now increasingly sophisticated and easy-to-access programs can inflict.  Here’s a closer look at the facts.  CLAIM: An image shows an explosion near the Pentagon.  THE FACTS: Police and fire officials in Arlington, Virginia, say the image is not real and there was no incident at the U.S. Department of Defense headquarters across the Potomac from the nation’s capital.  Despite this, the image and claim was spread by outlets including RT, a Russian government-backed media company formerly known as Russia Today. It was also widely shared in investment circles, including an account bearing Twitter’s signature blue verification check mark that falsely suggested it was associated with Bloomberg News.  “Reports of an explosion near the Pentagon in Washington DC,” the Russian state news agency wrote in a since-deleted tweet.  The timing of the fake image, which appeared to spread widely just after the U.S. stock market opened for trading at 9:30 a.m., was enough to send a ripple through the investment world.  The S&P 500 briefly dropped a modest 0.3% as social media accounts and investment websites popular with day traders repeated the false claims.  Other investments also moved in ways that typically occur when fear enters the market. Prices for U.S. Treasury bonds and gold, for example, briefly began to climb, suggesting investors were looking for someplace safer to park their money.  The image’s rapid spread prompted the Arlington County Fire Department to take to social media to knock down the rumors.  “@PFPAOfficial and the ACFD are aware of a social media report circulating online about an explosion near the Pentagon,” the agency wrote, referring to the acronym for the Pentagon Force Protection Agency that polices the Pentagon. “There is NO explosion or incident taking place at or near the Pentagon reservation, and there is no immediate danger or hazards to the public.”  Capt. Nate Hiner, a spokesperson for the fire department, confirmed the agency’s tweet was authentic but declined to comment further, deferring to the Pentagon police force, which didn’t respond to email and phone messages.  Misinformation experts say the fake image was likely created using generative artificial intelligence programs, which have allowed increasingly realistic visuals to flood the internet recently.  Inconsistencies in the building, fence and surrounding area are imperfections typically found in AI-generated images, noted Hany Farid, a computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy53ZXN0aGF3YWlpdG9kYXkuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMjMvbmF0aW9uLXdvcmxkLW5ld3MvZmFjdC1mb2N1cy1mYWtlLWltYWdlLW9mLXBlbnRhZ29uLWV4cGxvc2lvbi1icmllZmx5LXNlbmRzLWppdHRlcnMtdGhyb3VnaC1zdG9jay1tYXJrZXQv0gGYAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndlc3RoYXdhaWl0b2RheS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8yMy9uYXRpb24td29ybGQtbmV3cy9mYWN0LWZvY3VzLWZha2UtaW1hZ2Utb2YtcGVudGFnb24tZXhwbG9zaW9uLWJyaWVmbHktc2VuZHMtaml0dGVycy10aHJvdWdoLXN0b2NrLW1hcmtldC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Verified accounts on Twitter may have contributed to the viral spread of a false claim that an explosion was unfolding at the Pentagon.  Around 8:42 AM on Monday, a verified account on Twitter, labeling itself as a media and news organization, shared a fake image of smoke billowing near a white building they said was the Pentagon. The tweet's caption also misrepresented the Pentagon's location.  No such incident took place, the Arlington County Fire Department later said on Twitter. The Pentagon, the headquarters building of the U.S. Department of Defense, is located in Arlington County, Virginia.  A Pentagon spokesperson also told ABC News that no explosion had occurred.

Some of these accounts were verified, but they didn't appear to be coordinated, according to Cyabra.  A fake image spread on social media on Monday morning. ABC News  ""The bad news is that it appears that just a single account was able to achieve virality and cause maximum chaos,"" Gross added.  While ABC News has not been able to determine the source of the content, nor confirm that the original tweet was the 8:42 tweet, the image contains many hallmarks of being generated using a text-to-image AI tool.  There are many visual inconsistencies in the image, including a streetlamp that appears to be both in front and behind the metal barrier. Not to mention that the building itself doesn't look like the Pentagon.  Text-to-image tools powered by artificial intelligence allow users to input a natural language description, called a prompt, to get an image in return.  In the last few months, these tools have become increasingly sophisticated and accessible, leading to an explosion of hyperrealistic content fooling users online.  The original false tweet was eventually deleted, but not before it was amplified by a number of accounts on Twitter bearing the blue check that was once reserved for verified accounts, but which can now be purchased by any user.  ABC News could not immediately reach a spokesperson for Twitter to request comment.  What are the solutions?  ""Today's AI hoax of the Pentagon is a harbinger of what is to come,"" explained Truepic CEO Jeff McGregor, who says his company's technology can add a layer of transparency to content posted online.  Truepic, a founding member of the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity, has developed a camera technology that captures, signs, and seals critical details in every photo and video, such as time, date, and location.  Last month, Truepic, Revel ai, and Nina Schick released the world's first transparent deepfake signed by the C2PA's open standard. Truepic/Revel.ai  The company also created tools that would allow users to hover over a piece of AI-generated content to find out how it was fabricated. In April, they published the first ""transparent deepfake"" to showcase how the technology works.  While some companies have adopted the C2PA technology, it's now up to social media platforms to make that information available to their users.  ""This is an open-source technology that lets everyone attach metadata to their images to show that they created an image, when and where it was created, and what changes were made to it along the way,"" Dana Rao, general counsel and chief trust officer at Adobe, told ABC News. ""This allows people to prove what's real.""  Alterations would be identified. For example, if an image was cropped or filtered, that information could be displayed, but the user would also be able to select how much data they make available to the public.  Both state and local law enforcement were provided a written briefing Monday by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, an organization dedicated to countering extremism, hate and disinformation, with details on the incident.  ""Security and law enforcement officials are increasingly concerned there's an increased concern in AI-generated information operations intended to undermine credibility in government, stoke fear or even incite violence,"" said John Cohen, an ABC News contributor and former acting undersecretary for intelligence.  ""Digital content provenance will help mitigate these events by scaling transparency and authenticity in visual content by empowering users and creators,"" added McGregor.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vVVMvdmVyaWZpZWQtYWNjb3VudHMtaGVscGVkLW1ha2UtZmFrZS1pbWFnZXMtcGVudGFnb24tZXhwbG9zaW9uL3N0b3J5P2lkPTk5NTQxMzYx0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly9hYmNuZXdzLmdvLmNvbS9hbXAvVVMvdmVyaWZpZWQtYWNjb3VudHMtaGVscGVkLW1ha2UtZmFrZS1pbWFnZXMtcGVudGFnb24tZXhwbG9zaW9uL3N0b3J5P2lkPTk5NTQxMzYx?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"explosion","2023-09-01","Not Discerned","{""MexicoCity"", ""DistritoFederal"", ""Mexico""}","2023-05-22T22:15:00","SANTIAGO XALITZINTLA, Mexico (AP) — At the edge of this town near the Popocatepetl volcano, away from the din of traffic, there was an occasional low rumble Monday, like an idling engine.  A cloud of superfine ash descended, slightly reducing visibility and coming to rest on vehicles’ windshields. For more than a week, the 17,797-foot (5,425-meter) mountain just 45 miles (about 70 kilometers) southeast of Mexico City and known affectionately as “El Popo,” has been increasingly explosive, spewing great plumes of gas, ash and incandescent rock into the air.  The activity led the Mexican government to raise the warning level and to close schools in dozens of municipalities across three states. On Monday, local, state and federal officials held drills for the possibility of evacuations.  “You hear it more at night,” said Violeta Fuentes, 39, who lives with her husband and two children, ages 9 and 12, on the outskirts of Santiago Xalitzintla. That’s also when they can see the glow from the crater. “Last night, several times it would go out one moment and then light up again.""  Fuentes said she was a bit unnerved by it “because you can see (the volcano) doesn’t want to be okay anymore.” The family worried about the impact the falling ash would have on their crops. Her father-in-law’s corn across the street was already coated in it.  The alerts and preparations, however, are old hat for residents here.  Job Amalco, a driver, said it was normal. “It doesn’t scare us. We’re spectators of what nature gives us,” he said proudly.  But anxiety was beginning to build among some.  “It’s worrisome, above all because of the children, because you don’t know if there will be an enormous explosion or a small one,” said Claudia de la Cruz, 27, who has two children ages 3 and 5.  Her husband hikes up the volcano’s flanks each day to collect firewood to make charcoal. “He says that there it sounds like the peaks are crashing down and it shakes, but he’s brave for us,” she said.  De la Cruz remembers as a girl the first time she saw the mountain glow and how back then residents had very little information. She trusts that now with a cellphone they will know in real time what is happening.  Still, the real warning residents listen for — as it has been her whole life — will be the urgent tolling of the town’s church bells. Monday they rang out as part of the drill.  There were no signs of panic Monday, but people worried about the possibility of having to evacuate, leaving homes and animals unattended. Authorities have warned people to stay out of 7.5-mile (12-kilometer) radius around the peak.  Florencio de Olarte, 69, and Plácida de Aquino, 72, recalled having to evacuate their home in the center of town twice before, years ago. On those occasions, “you could see (the volcano) was lit up, throwing out rocks,” Olarte said.  One of their children already wants them to come to Mexico City, but the couple doesn’t want to leave before authorities tell them they have to, because of their turkeys, pig and donkey. “We have animals and couldn’t leave them,” Aquino said.  “Right now there’s a lot of smoke plume and it oozes and thunders, the curtains shake,” Aquino said. But for the moment nothing more.  The volcano’s activity temporary halted flights at the capital’s two airports over the weekend.  On Monday, an ash plume extended hundreds of miles (hundreds of kilometers) to the east, stretching out over the Bay of Campeche, according to a U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration report.  On Sunday, national Civil Defense Coordinator Laura Velázquez said in a news conference that the stoplight-style warning system for the volcano remained on yellow, but had risen to phase 3. Still, she said, “there is no risk to the population at this time.”  In this phase, large domes develop and explode in increasing intensity, launching incandescent rock into the air and pyroclastic flows down its flanks.  Velázquez said only three of the volcano’s 565 explosions since September had been big, and the current activity was not the greatest of this century. On Monday, she oversaw the drill in Santiago Xalitzintla.  “We don't know what's going to happen,” she said Monday. “We are prepared for any scenario.”  The Defense Department said it was ready to activate 6,500 troops if necessary. Shelters were being prepared.  Some 25 million people live within a 60-mile (100-kilometer) radius, most of those in Mexico City’s metropolitan area.  Popocatepetl came to life in 1994 after a decades-long dormancy and experienced periods of greater activity from 2000 to 2003 and 2012 to 2016.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3NwZWN0cnVtbG9jYWxuZXdzLmNvbS9ueXMvY2VudHJhbC1ueS9hcC10b3AtbmV3cy8yMDIzLzA1LzIyL21leGljb3MtcG9wb2NhdGVwZXRsLXZvbGNhbm8tc3Bld2luZy1hc2gtYW5kLWdhcy1jbG9zZXMtc2Nob29sc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"explosion","2023-12-08","10:15:00","{""West"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T09:16:47","The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has warned that the combination of heat-trapping greenhouse gases and an El Niño event will likely lead to record global temperatures in the next five years. There is a 98% chance that at least one of these years, and the entire period, will be the warmest on record. The WMO’s report also states a 66% chance of annual average surface temperatures between 2023-2027 being more than 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels for at least one year, temporarily breaching Paris Agreement targets.  El Niño’s impact on global weather patterns  El Niño and La Niña are part of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) system, which influences global weather patterns. During El Niño, weaker trade winds cause warm water to spread towards the Americas, resulting in increased global temperatures. On the other hand, La Niña creates stronger trade winds, leading to warm water off Asia and cold water near the Americas, causing a slight decrease in global temperatures. The last three years have experienced cooling effects from La Niña episodes, but with the phenomenon ending in March 2023, the upcoming El Niño will likely cause a surge in global temperatures.  El Niño events can also lead to extreme weather conditions such as droughts, floods, and heatwaves. For example, the 2014-16 El Niño phase caused crop failure and damaged food security for over 60 million people, according to the UN Food and Agricultural Organisation. In addition, El Niño events can reduce fish stocks for South American fishing communities, as less cold water rises and fewer nutrients are available for marine species like squid and salmon.

I hereby agree to the Privacy Policy  Record-breaking temperatures and repercussions  With a 98% chance of at least one year between 2023-2027 being the hottest on record, experts are concerned about the far-reaching repercussions of this heat surge. WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas warns that the combination of a warming El Niño and human-induced climate change will push global temperatures into “uncharted territory”. This could have significant impacts on health, food security, water management, and the environment.  Higher temperatures can lead to more extreme weather events, sea-level rise, melting ice and glaciers, as well as ocean heat and acidification. Although the WMO report does not indicate a permanent exceedance of the 1.5°C warming level outlined in the Paris Agreement, it warns of temporary breaches occurring with increasing frequency.  Preparing for the heatwave: Early warning systems and resilience  To help prepare for the extreme weather events associated with El Niño, experts will discuss strengthening weather services to support climate change adaptation at the upcoming World Meteorological Congress. One of the main priorities is the Early Warnings for All Initiative, launched by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres at COP27 in 2022. This initiative aims to close gaps in early warning systems, especially in developing countries, and link them to policies, communications, and emergency response plans.  Recurring drought in Europe: How to deal with the consequences of climate change The impact of the current drought is not limited to the environment but also has significant economic and ecological consequences.  Despite the increasing number of extreme weather events, data collected in 2022 revealed that only half of WMO member states have systems in place to inform people and governments of impending hazardous weather. Guterres has called on the WMO to help ensure that every person on Earth is protected by early warning systems within five years. However, resource-poor regions may struggle to adapt in time, raising questions about their resilience to natural hazards.  A future of amplified climate extremes  Climate scientist Daniel Swain from the University of California, Los Angeles, believes there is an increase in extreme El Niño events due to climate change. With a 90% chance of the upcoming El Niño persisting into early 2024, the second half of 2023 or early 2024 may break global temperature records. As Earth’s natural climate cycle and human-caused climate change are not independent, post-El Niño temperatures will remain elevated due to global warming.  As the world braces for the explosive synergy of El Niño and climate change, nations must prioritise preparedness and adapt to the changing climate landscape. With the potential for unprecedented heatwaves, floods, and droughts, it is crucial to invest in early warning systems, bolster emergency response plans, and support vulnerable communities in building resilience to these extreme weather events.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vaW5ub3ZhdGlvbm9yaWdpbnMuY29tL2VuL2V4cGxvc2l2ZS1zeW5lcmd5LWVsLW5pbm8tYW5kLWNsaW1hdGUtY2hhbmdlLXRvLXVubGVhc2gtdW5wcmVjZWRlbnRlZC1oZWF0d2F2ZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

This book is about an explosion on the lunar surface that leads 17-year-old Matty Weber on a worldwide adventure to solve a multi-tiered mystery that reveals who he can really trust.  While Matty is gazing upward at the evening sky, he witnesses an explosion on the lunar surface and later a cryptic message drawn by a skywriting plane. At the time, he does not realize how prophetic these events will be in his school life or for the people on Earth. School is out for the winter. School is out forever? Something weird is happening all over Matty’s small town of Scotsbourgh.  Why is everyone acting strange? Has Matty changed, or is it the people around him? To discover and sort through the clues, he teams up with the grown-ups: his biological dad, his mother, and his stepdad, along with his friends Gabriel and Samantha. From the streets of Scotsbourgh to a brief stay at Stanford University, the adventure is on!  They travel to study dinosaur fossil remains and Mars rock in Utah before a boarding a first class flight on a C-17 air transport plane to the ruins of Gobekli Tepe in Turkey and then to India. Matty’s search for the truth makes him realize he sees only the tip of this iceberg-like mystery. He summons all his wits and newly gained skills to overcome the ultimate challenge but not before learning that these growing pains are an integral part of reaching his goal.  “This book provides an alternate take on what was happening around us during the past three years. It also speaks about normal teen issues like angst and trust,” DiBarone says.

As Variety reported, the episodes were the show’s “most-watched ever, with an average combined audience of 2.5 million on Bravo, on-demand and the Peacock platform within three days — a 77% increase over last season.” For those living under a rock the past few months, the uptick in viewership is due to Scandoval, aka the shocking cheating scandal recently uncovered between Tom Sandoval, who was in the midst of a nine-year relationship with series queen and fan favorite Ariana Madix, and co-star Raquel Leviss, which categorically turned the Bravoverse on its head!  The intense scrutiny hasn’t died down since, with such news outlets as CNN and The New York Times covering the story and everyone from Kristin Chenoweth to former “Bachelor” Nick Viall to Roy Wood Jr. (at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner no less!) weighing in on the drama. Even comedian Howie Mandel, of all people, flagrantly inserted himself into the narrative by landing Sandoval’s first post-scandal interview, much to “Watch What Happens Live” host Andy Cohen’s chagrin.  In light of the staggering events, DIRT rounded up all the spots where the most salacious scenes went down throughout the first part of the season for a “Vanderpump Rules” mega post in late March.

"explosion","2019-10-17","Not Discerned","{""Yekaterinburg"", ""Sverdlovsk"", ""Russia""}","2023-05-22T14:41:48","A recent video by the macrocycle analysis channel, The Chart Guys, hosted by crypto Youtuber Jason Pizzino, offered an extensive examination of historical cycles in stocks, real estate, and bitcoin (BTC).  The analyst provided intriguing insights into possible market trends in six to twelve months. The video explored the influence of bitcoin on the global economy, pondering whether it is driving market shifts or the other way around.  The role of timing in the global market was a significant theme in the discussion. The video pointed out that stock market lows have historically tended to occur in October and March. Many prolonged bear markets – a general decline in the stock market over some time – reached their lowest points around these months.  However, 483 days into the bear market that began after the market’s peak in January 2018, the prediction for another stock market low in October appears low. As pointed out in the video, bear markets generally do not provide multiple chances for October lows. Markets typically take no longer than 10 months from their highest to their lowest point. By comparison, the global financial crisis had its first significant low 13 months from the top, with the final low coming 17 months later.  You might also like: From Lehman Brothers to First Republic Bank: Bitcoin’s rise in uncertainty  The channel also addressed the pattern of bitcoin’s six-month cycles. After just experiencing the first of these, where bitcoin moved from its low to a fresh high, it is anticipated to continue its upward trend in the next six-month period, potentially mirroring the movements of the S&P 500.  When analyzing the macrocycle of bitcoin and the stock market, the channel suggests focusing on the current second period of the market, which is currently in an accumulation phase. Drawing parallels with the previous cycle in 2019, which experienced range-bound activity in the second six months following a robust initial six months of accumulation, the speaker expects a similar trend – consolidation followed by an upward movement.  Investors seeking all-time bitcoin highs might need to be patient, as the prediction is that this breakthrough may not occur until the fourth period. Furthermore, the window between the fourth and sixth months tends to be a bustling time as retailers enter the market.  On another note, while the S&P 500 has demonstrated clean upward movements, the bitcoin market’s earlier drastic upward swings, such as going from one cent to $32, are deemed less likely to recur. Instead, investors should keep an eye on the S&P 500’s trajectory, as its breakout from all-time highs could be a precursor to bitcoin testing its highs.  According to technical analyst Michael van de Poppe, bitcoin and the S&P 500 may test their all-time highs within 12 months. Van de Poppe sees a third six-month period, leading up to the first half of 2024, as a potential breakout to the top for bitcoin. However, he also cautions that the next six months could entail more consolidation than outright bullish moves.  The video explores the possibility of current market lows being the start of a new macrocycle for both bitcoin and the S&P 500. As market dynamics shift, seeing how these predictions play out will be intriguing. The Chart Guys channel promises to monitor any changes or early developments closely. As always, market participants are advised to undertake their research and due diligence before making investment decisions.

SB 740 extends the skilled and trained workforce requirements applied to petroleum refineries to emerging green industries including hydrogen manufacturing, biofuels manufacturing, and carbon dioxide capture. The bill now advances to policy committees in the State Assembly.  “SB 740 is focused on protecting communities from industrial disasters while increasing good paying jobs in sustainable industries,” said Senator Cortese (D-San Jose). “We want to safeguard the environment, protect communities and workers, and build the economy by ensuring that skilled and trained California workers perform the jobs of the future.”  A skilled and trained workforce ensures that workers are performing work in apprenticeable occupations. The Building Trades have 75,000 apprentices in California with a total membership of nearly 500,000.  SB 740 is modeled after SB 54, a 2013 law that required California’s domestic petroleum refineries to use a skilled and trained workforce to perform onsite contracted work. Lawmakers passed SB 54 largely out of concern over the vulnerabilities exposed after the 2012 Richmond refinery fire, a preventable explosion that clouded the East Bay with black smoke and chemicals and prompted a stay-at-home order. SB 740 would ensure that workers in industrial facilities had the training and skills to properly perform their jobs and help prevent accidents and toxic discharges that harm local communities  The bill will also contribute to California’s emerging green workforce and help meet the state’s climate goals. When California’s refineries shifted to a skilled and trained workforce, the industry did not report worker shortages or disruptions. In fact, the shift worked so well that many refineries chose to enter into direct project labor agreements with the Building Trades.  Here are additional bills by Senator Cortese that passed Monday’s Senate floor session:  SB 636 – Stopping Medical Coverage Denials by Physicians not Licensed in California – Stops insurance companies from enlisting out-of-state doctors to cancel medical treatment plans proposed by California doctor for workers’ compensation claims for certain patients.  SB 745 – Drought Resistant Buildings – Directs the California Building Standards Commission to develop mandatory building standards to reduce the designed potable water demand of new buildings by 25 percent to minimize the use of potable water for non-potable uses.  ***","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vc2QxNS5zZW5hdGUuY2EuZ292L25ld3Mvc2VuYXRlLXBhc3Nlcy1zZW5hdG9yLWNvcnRlc2VzLWJpbGwtY3JlYXRlLWhpZ2gtcXVhbGl0eS1qb2JzLWdyZWVuLWluZHVzdHJ50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Speaking at the Bitcoin 2023 conference, Lewis shared that he conducted extensive interviews with individuals close to Bankman-Fried, as well as employees, investors, Bahamas officials and U.S. regulators.  Although the movie rights have already been sold to Apple, the final manuscript is still a few months away from its due date, The Block reported.  Lewis said the project initially began with an unexpected phone call from a friend who ran a Wall Street firm in 2021.  The friend had a potential business deal involving shares exchanged with a company led by Bankman-Fried, Lewis said, adding he was asked to spend time with Bankman-Fried and report back.  This marked the beginning of an incredible journey that would take Lewis to Hong Kong and the Bahamas, where he conducted interviews with over 100 people, he said.

As the reporting progressed until October of the previous year, Lewis wasn't certain if he had enough material for a compelling narrative.  Fate intervened when FTX experienced a sudden and dramatic implosion.  This unexpected turn of events provided Lewis with the much-needed climax for his book.  He expressed gratitude for the development, as it gave his story a captivating third act.  While Lewis did not provide an exact publication date, he expressed his desire to release the book to coincide with the potential start of a criminal trial against Bankman-Fried.  Prosecutors initially targeted October for the trial, although Bankman-Fried's legal team has indicated a possible request for a date extension.

Yet Stause, 41, continued with her claims, imitating Young’s exaggerated hand movements before suggesting she was acting erratic because she was on drugs.  Chrishell Stause didn’t hold back during an explosive fight with “Selling Sunset” co-star Nicole Young. Selling Sunset/Netflix  The 41-year-old accused Young of being “on drugs” while filming. Selling Sunset/Netflix  “I don’t know what is in your drink or what you’re on but I’m just saying I’m good with not having this conversation because it doesn’t seem like there is just wine in your glass,” Stause continued. “You’ve been acting a little cracked out all night.”  Young — who called Stause a “bitch” — then looked to the rest of the cast for backup, but they all seemed too stunned to jump in.  After Young left the table, Stause doubled down on the allegations, claiming she had previously seen her doing drugs.  “It doesn’t seem like there is just wine in your glass,” Stause told the Netflix newcomer. Selling Sunset/Netflix  However, the Netflix newcomer has denied Stause’s claims, telling People the accusations left her feeling “gutted.”  “When she first said it, I felt like I’d just been hit by a train. I was so shocked,” Young told the outlet. “I was like a deer in headlights. It took me a moment to even process what she had said, and I was gutted. I was just absolutely gutted.”  In fact, she even took a drug test to prove that she was clean.  Young later denied being on drugs, telling People she was “so shocked” by Stause’s below-the-belt accusations. Getty Images  Although the two ladies were friendly before the show started, things quickly turned sour after Young accused Stause of taking credit for two of her listings three years prior. (Young has been part of The Oppenheim Group since 2014 but only joined the cast during the show’s sixth season).  While they tried to work out their issues on numerous occasions, the pair came to blows at fellow agent Chelsea Lazkani’s broker’s open, where Stause called Young a “bitch.”  Just weeks after cameras started rolling for the new season of “Selling Sunset,” Stause alluded to the drama on her Instagram Story.  The reality TV stars have had bad blood ever since Young accused Stause of stealing two of her real estate listings. Getty Images for CLD PR  Although she didn’t call anyone out by name, the reality TV star slammed a cast member — presumably Young — for being “fake” and acting out for “attention.”  “The thirst for camera time on season 6 is REAL. Wow. That was insanity,” Stause wrote.“But also SO transparent. Get your 15mins girl but leave my business out of it 🤡.”  For more Page Six reality TV updates  Stause alluded to the drama last year while filming Season 6 of “Selling Sunset.” Getty Images  She also shared that she had screenshots “archived for this very moment” to prove the pair had no issues until cameras started rolling.  “Of COURSE you have a huge issue with me now-not before-when you have a camera crew around you,” she continued. “I hate fake. If you want camera time-JUST SAY THAT. I would have helped you get the right angle.”  Season 6 of “Selling Sunset” is now streaming on Netflix.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vcGFnZXNpeC5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8yMi9zZWxsaW5nLXN1bnNldC1zdGFyLWNocmlzaGVsbC1zdGF1c2UtYWNjdXNlcy1uaWNvbGUteW91bmctb2YtYmVpbmctb24tZHJ1Z3Mv0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly9wYWdlc2l4LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzIyL3NlbGxpbmctc3Vuc2V0LXN0YXItY2hyaXNoZWxsLXN0YXVzZS1hY2N1c2VzLW5pY29sZS15b3VuZy1vZi1iZWluZy1vbi1kcnVncy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"explosion","2023-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T00:47:00","ChatGPT has been the talk of the crypto community for quite some time now. Although we are unsure about how beneficial AI technology can be for trading, in the long run, it hasn’t stopped investors from rushing to ChatGPT to see if it can give them an edge.  While there is plenty of AI technology out there the internet at the moment is obsessed with ChatGPT and using it to try and get an edge on the market. The only issue here is that ChatGPT does not make predictions. If you ask it straight up to make a crypto prediction it will warn you that it cannot tell the future and also let you know that the crypto market especially is very hard to predict.  However, the internet always finds a way. Inspired by the iPhone’s jailbreak version, users managed to find a way around ChatGPTs restrictions and get it to make predictions. In this case, when you question the AI technology it will give you its standard answer, and a jailbreak answer below that in this case will give you a price prediction for a crypto.  The way you access jailbreak will change as the AI technology will update but the best way we find is to give it a hypothetical like it is a character starring in a movie that is an expert on crypto and his client asks him for advice on a particular currency. You can find the best ways to bypass ChatGPT’s restrictions online but this is what we went with.  The results were very interesting and in particular, it thought these 7 cryptos would explode in 2023  AiDoge- The New King of Meme Coins  While everyone in the crypto community seems to be looking at ChatGPT for their AI fix there is a coin going through presale that already utilizes it in their crypto project. AiDoge (Ai), which has just surpassed $ 9.5 million raised in its presale, will also be the first meme-to-earn platform.  Users will be able to earn native currency by making memes with the help of AI technology. It is a genius idea that has whales flocking towards the presale and we can see why ChatGPT thinks it will explode in 2023 because it basically has already.  >>> Buy AiDoge Now<<<  Spongebob Token- The successor to Pepe Coin  The meme coins have taken over the crypto world thanks to projects like AiDoge but also Pepe coin (PEPE) the overnight sensation came from nowhere and pumped so much that it made its investors rich overnight. Now everyone is searching for the next PEPE.  ChatGPT seems to think that it will be Spongebob Token ($SPONGE) and we agree. The meme is one so popular with the internet and crypto culture that we cannot believe nobody has used it before now. $SPONGE also represents a great buy low spot so we think that’s why the AI technology predicts it will explode.  >>> Buy SpongeBob Token Now<<<  Ecoterra- ChatGPT loves its potential to be the no1 green crypto  Green cryptos are going to get more and more popular with impending regulations but Ecoterra (ECOTERRA) is a level above the competition because of its real-life benefits to the environment. Through reverse vending machines, they will reward people with recycling with native currency.  Businesses will be encouraged to purchase their own while individuals will be able to use the machines in partner supermarkets. The presale is closing in on $4 million raised and ChatGPT thinks it will pump once the CEX listings begin.  >>> Buy Ecoterra Now<<<  yPredict- Another project using AI to beat the market  ChatGPT seems to understand the market loves projects that utilize AI technology and that makes sense when you look at yPredict’s (YPRED) potential. The idea of the platform is to help traders get an advantage again. There are too many smart algorithms out there so if you can’t beat them join them right?  On the yPredict platform, there will be the best AI/ML experts, financial quants, and traders. The platform will incentify them to share their work on their platform for their users so they can get an edge on the market. The presale is just beginning to take off so YPRED is still available at a good price.  >>> Buy yPredict Now<<<  DeeLance- ChatGPT likes the innovation behind this platform token  ChatGPT seems to love a project that is original and innovative and that is exactly what DeeLance (DLANCE) is. The project aims to solve a problem and that’s connecting employers and freelancers in a more streamlined way. Through a decentralized platform and Web 3.0 technology they will make this a possibility.  By using a peer-to-peer payment system they can charge fees much lower than Web 2.0 legacy sites and an escrow system will make sure that there will no longer be problems with payment for work on either side. An innovative NFT token ownership model will also revolutionize how we define ownership of work. An idea ChatGPT seems to think will attract lots of freelancers and employers.  >>> Buy DeeLance Now<<<  Launchpad xyz- Making Web 3.0 technology accessible to everyone  While ChatGPT seems to be fond of projects that are heavy in Web 3.0 and AI technologies, one of its recommendations is a project that helps bridge the gap between these and the everyday person. Launchpad xyz (LPX) is that project.  They understand how Web 3.0 technology can be daunting for most and with so many new projects popping up their platform aims to give investors the best tools to understand both how Web 3.0 works and also the best projects to invest in that use the technology. This will likely only grow in popularity the more widely adopted Web 3.0 is in everyday life.  >>> Buy Launchpad XYZ Now<<<  Shiba Inu- ChatGPT thinks the meme coin might bounce back  While not as strong as the first 6 projects, ChatGPT thinks Shiba Inu (SHIB) also has the chance to explode in 2023. The meme coin which for so long was number 2 in the sector has had a tough month as investors flock to other meme coins.  However this could be a buy-low spot, the inventors have shown commitment to growing the ecosystem this year with Shibarium and other innovations. It is a low-risk high-reward option so we think this is why ChatGPT recommends it.  Conclusion  To conclude, we cannot guarantee that ChatGPT will be accurate with its prediction but when we use the jailbreak function it does seem to be quite bullish on the cryptos in this piece. What makes us trust this more is all these projects have genuine chances to pump with some great project ideas, especially the ones going through presale. Invest at your own risk but there are great opportunities here.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuYWx5dGljc2luc2lnaHQubmV0L2NoYXRncHQtcHJlZGljdHMtdGhlc2UtY3J5cHRvcy13aWxsLWV4cGxvZGUtaW4tMjAyMy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Dyno Nobel, an explosive manufacturing company, notified the federal government of the loss and said in a statement that it was investigating what happened during the nearly two-week journey from Wyoming to California, according to the report.  The company said the rail car with the material was sealed when it left a manufacturing site in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and the seals were still intact when it arrived in Saltdale, California.  ""The initial assessment is that a leak through the bottom gate on the rail car may have developed in transit,"" the statement said.  A report made on May 10 to the National Response Center, a federal emergency call center for railroad incidents, said that the rail car left Wyoming on April 12 and arrived in California empty.  Dyno Nobel said that the rail car was transported back to Wyoming for further investigation and that it had ""limited control"" of the train's activity while the cargo was being transported. ■","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vZW5nbGlzaC5uZXdzLmNuL25vcnRoYW1lcmljYS8yMDIzMDUyMy84MmQzNzdlN2ZlODM0ZjQ0OTVlYzg0YmY1YmRjZjI0YS9jLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

It tells the story of Lydia, a coming-of-ageless vampire forced to deal with the loss of her best friend, Sam, after the pair conjures a moment of complete clarity which causes Sam’s head to explode.  In the aftermath, Lydia must contend with old ghosts, generational trauma, oppressive authority figures, and the confusing fear of infinity to set reality right and save her own sanity.  “I love making weird stuff that a studio would be afraid of and a computer couldn’t replicate,” Bryan said.  The film will show at the Salem Witch Board Museum in Salem, Mass. on June 3 during a double-feature with the shorts of filmmaker Jim McDonough, and again the following weekend to kick off the Bride of FrankenCon convention in Alcoa, Tenn. on June 9. The two-weekend premiere will be followed by screenings at festivals this fall.  Bryan and Producer/Star Emily Daniels have spent the last two years perfecting their DIY movie-making style.

The company will launch the film at the Marche Du Film this week.  THE BECOMERS tells the story of a body-snatching alien who comes to Earth, reconnects with their partner, and tries to find their way in modern America.  “During the pandemic, I binged the original Star Trek series for the first time and then I made this movie,” Clark said on his latest film.” It felt like life as we knew it was ending, but then again, it also felt like that might not be the worst thing either. The Becomers is a story of love, longing, and alienation. A kitsch-soaked, pathos-laden melodrama about our sad, sad planet. It's the weirdest thing I've ever made and I can't think of anyone better than Yellow Veil to get it out into the universe.”  Joe Yanick, Co-Founder of Yellow Veil Pictures added, “I’ve long admired Zach’s films and it’s especially fun to see him dive even further into the genre space with The Becomers, which is something his films have always circled. The Becomers is funny, weird, and at times gross, but what I like best is that it's a very relatable movie about love; and I think that’s a place where some of the best genre films emerge from. “  THE BECOMERS is written, directed, and edited by Clark and produced by Joe Swanberg (Happy Christmas, Digging for Fire), and Edwin Linker (Saint Frances, Queen of Earth) of Slasher Films. It stars Molly Plunk (Little Sister, Profane), Mike Lopez (All Jacked Up and Full of Worms, Crimes Against Humanity), Frank V. Ross (Drinking Buddies), Isabel Alamin, and Keith Kelly, and features the voice Russell Mael, lead singer of the explosive pop-rock band Sparks.  Best known for the critically acclaimed White Reindeer (SXSW) released by IFC Films, and Little Sister (SXSW), featuring Addison Timlin and Ally Sheedy, Clark is also a celebrated editor whose credits extend beyond his own films and include Sophia Takal’s Always Shine (Tribeca 2016), Hannah Fidell’s The Long Dumb Road (Sundance 2018), Michael Tully’s Don’t Leave Home (SXSW 2018), and Michael M.

Special make-up is provided by Italian master of horror Sergio Stivaletti (Demons, Demons 2, Phenomena), who also co-produces.

Once the Conner Cougars took the lead with six runs in the top of the fourth, Mangold dialed it up several notches to help the Cougars beat the 35th District champion Covington Catholic Colonels, 6-2 in the 9th Region Baseball Tournament Quarterfinals on Sunday at Thomas More Stadium.  The victory gets Conner (26-12) back in the region semifinals against Highlands on Monday at 8 p.m. for the second time in three years following a disappointing quarterfinal exit against Newport Central Catholic last year.  “When you get six runs in an inning, it’s a huge weight off your shoulders,” Mangold said. “Right when I got out there, I knew exactly what my job was. That was to pound the strike zone and get out of innings. I got very fortunate to have a good defense behind me to back me up. On top of that, I could locate my pitches. My catcher (senior Logan Tucker) made the right calls on pitches to get the strikes that I needed.”  Mangold (8-1) recorded all nine strikeouts after the third inning. Head coach Brad Arlinghaus said he took on a bulldog look from that point. Mangold only allowed two base runners after the third inning, holding the Colonel (23-10) offense to two hits in the game.  “We just kept reminding him we’ve been here before. We had Brody Mangold on the mound, who has been our number one since his sophomore year. He hasn’t pitched in a region tournament since his sophomore year so I had all the faith in the world he’d right the ship,” Arlinghaus said.  Mangold issued three walks and a hit batter, a walk and hit by pitch coming in the first inning where the Cougars ran into their only trouble of the night.  The Colonels scored two unearned runs in the top of the first. Mangold hit CovCath junior center fielder Charlie Dieruf. Dieruf then moved to second on a Mangold throwing error then third when sophomore shortstop Jackson Reardon reached on another Conner fielding error. Reardon then stole second.

But on that fourth ball, the ball bounced into the Conner dugout on the wild pitch allowing Dieruf and Reardon to score giving the Colonels a 2-0 lead.  Conner’s defense dug in and made the routine plays for the most part after that when they had to. Mangold struck out the side in the fourth and fifth innings. Senior left fielder Tyler Rennekamp drew a walk to open the top of the seventh. But Mangold struck out the next two Colonels and Dieruf flew out to senior left fielder Jackson Bucks to end the game.  “We really battled back after the rough first inning,” said Aaron Wichmann, Conner junior first baseman. “We put some sticks together and got the job done.”  Conner collected eight hits. The Cougars exploded for six runs in the top of the fourth, scoring five unearned runs off three CovCath errors.  Senior right fielder Braiden Stidham singled and stole second. Senior second baseman Cody Henson then singled him in to trim the Colonel lead to 2-1. Henson then reached second when senor designated hitter Jeffery Vest reached on a CovCath error and the two moved up one base when Tucker grounded out. The Cougars then tied the game 2-2 when senior left fielder Jackson Bucks reached on an infield single scoring Henson.  “Here’s my thing. You don’t have to hit the ball like crazy,” Bucks said. “If you put in the effort and you run down that line, any ball becomes a hit. I’ve seen plenty of people do it so as long as their is effort involved, that’s all that matters. Plays happen. Errors happen. If one little thing goes wrong, you jump into it and you get a hit out of it.”  Senior center fielder Ayden Lohr then gave the Cougars the lead for good at 4-2, tripling to the right center gap scoring Vest and Bucks. Lohr then scored on another CovCath error and junior shortstop Rex Richter scored on a wild pitch after reaching on an error to make the final score.  That took CovCath out out of its game, which includes a lot of small ball. Arlinghaus played at CovCath for head coach Bill Krumpelbeck many years ago.  “That’s one of the best programs in Northern Kentucky over the last 40 years so I know how they operate,” Arlinghaus said. “I know that small ball gets them going. Once you put a six spot up on them, it knocks the wind out of them.”  CovCath junior pitcher Eli Wagner (1-1) pitched into the fourth inning, striking out four and walking none. Senior Chris Young finished the game striking out two and allowing one hit.  The Colonels graduate four seniors in Young, Fitz, Max Lawrie and Rennekamp. The Colonels won two district championships in their time in high school.  “They did a good job leading the younger players,” Krumpelbeck said. “We’re used to having 12 or more. In every season I’ve ever coached, I’ve never had four. Kids make mistakes. We had a lot of pressure (Sunday) and obviously, we didn’t handle it.”  CovCath lost in the region quarterfinals for the second straight year. The Colonels lost in the region championship to Beechwood two years ago as their region title drought now reaches 18 years.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vbGlua25reS5jb20vc3BvcnRzL2Jhc2ViYWxsLzIwMjMvMDUvMjIvY29ubmVyLXVzZXMtbWFuZ29sZHMtYXJtLWV4cGxvc2l2ZS1pbm5pbmctdG8tYWR2YW5jZS1pbi05dGgtcXVhcnRlcmZpbmFscy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Several media outlets and millions of Twitter users took the fake verified Twitter account 'Bloomberg Feed' for a real Bloomberg-affiliated account, as it had a blue check.  Twitter suspended that account later but the damage was already done.  The fake tweet spooked some investors. The S&P 500 dropped sharply in the minutes after the image was amplified by well-followed accounts. It later recovered those losses, reports NBC News.  The image depicted a large plume of smoke next to a rectangular building with only a passing resemblance to the Pentagon.  Russian state-controlled news network RT also shared the image, according to screenshots that users captured before the tweet was deleted.  Several Twitter accounts with hundreds of thousands of followers, like Deltaone, OSINTdefender and Whale Chart shared it, reports TechCrunch.  The incident also raised the question of how generative AI could be used to trick users at a mass level.  The Arlington, Virginia, fire department tweeted that ""there is NO explosion or incident taking place at or near the Pentagon.""  After the fake Pentagon image went viral, a copycat hoaxer also pushed a similar image of the White House on fire.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wdW5qYWJuZXdzZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vdGVjaG5vbG9neS9uZXdzL2Zha2UtYWktaW1hZ2Utb2YtcGVudGFnb24tZXhwbG9zaW9uLXB1dHMtdHdpdHRlcnMtcGFpZC1ibHVlLXRpY2staW4tcXVlc3Rpb24tMjEwNTU50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"explosion","0202-01-01","18:00:00","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T13:00:00","Disclaimer: This is a special version made for the media to experience, and contents may differ from the final version.  Final Fantasy XVI is a game of spectacle, where nothing else matters except looking cool and feeling great while doing it. The animation and flow of combat both mix to create a feeling of playing a cutscene at any given moment, whether you’re dueling against another human or taking control of a god-sized beast to throw down against another god.  As a Final Fantasy game, the first two hours of the experience are packed with expository cutscenes, but thankfully FF16 takes them at a satisfying pace. It helps, too, that the character writing is solid, making the story you’re forced to sit through entertaining at the very least.  If you’re new to JRPGs, this kind of front-loaded infodumping might be off-putting, but there are plenty of great games that start much more slowly – Persona 5 being a prime example of this – and have still managed to attract a sizable fan base. This storytelling might be slow, but it’s worth paying attention to, as the political intrigue on display sets the tone for a Game of Thrones-style story that is as interesting as it is entertaining.  All it takes is one or two simple scenes, and we’ve already seen a glimpse of all the major players from all six nations in Final Fantasy XVI’s world. These cutscenes promptly and expertly tell us who these people are, what motivates them, and hint at the secrets and hidden motives pulling the strings of our main cast.  Clive, the game’s main protagonist, is pretty instantly a more intriguing protagonist than Final Fantasy XV’s Noctis ever was, with a motivation that seems basic on its face but appears to have a great deal of depth to it. Clive’s motivation may be vengeance, but it comes with a background of internal struggle that is genuinely fascinating and should be exciting to see play out in the full game.  It doesn’t take long before the action starts to ramp up, and you see that all the infodumping was very much worth sitting through. You’ll start by clearing out goblins from an abandoned village, but in a flash you’ll find yourself in the midst of a cinematic clash between two gargantuan gods known as Eikons.  Having played a bit of the game previously, I’m still less than impressed with Eikon battles. They tend to be a bit boring, as the combat is slow and your attacks feel weak. Combine this with the fact that these battles are largely scripted, and it feels very much at odds with ordinary combat, which is fast, flashy, and fluid.  For much of the game, you’ll be playing as Clive, whose sword attacks and elemental powers make him a versatile character to play as. Striking with your sword is at the core of the combat system, but it’s action-packed and fast-paced, with combos and dodges all flowing into one another.  There are also Eikon attacks, which can take a bit of time to charge up, but can pretty much erase a basic enemy. They can also be used to deal big damage to a boss fight, but there’s not a great deal of depth to the system — you just wait for it to charge up and fire it off to deal damage.  That said, the combat system is a lot of fun and is a massive improvement on the action RPG gameplay of the last game. Even basic moves always look great, with gorgeous, vivid effects accentuating movement and attacks, and the combos are packed with style and neat visual effects.  On tougher enemies, though, combat can get pretty stagnant and samey at times. Most fights will eventually lead to a cinematic-like moment, which plays out a sequence where your input into the combat is very minimal, like a button press or a few button mashes. They help break up the monotony a little bit and go a long way to emphasize crucial moments in a battle.  Linear level design also helps keep the pacing of encounters interesting, as does a wide variety of enemy types to fight against. It prevents you from settling into a rut, and the only time you really get to let loose is in the open areas, which let you roam freely and complete quests, fight tough enemies, and find useful items.  I didn’t personally get bored of the combat in the four-hour hands-on session, but it’s hard to say how it will come together for the full runtime of the game. The addition of new elements and enemies throughout could help it from getting too repetitive, but we won’t know for sure until we get stuck into it.  Overall, Final Fantasy XVI has a lot to like, but a lot to be wary about. There’s definitely plenty to look forward to, but some aspects like the Eikon fights throw up some concerns. The narrative looks to be the best in the series for a long time, and there’s a great deal of momentum that makes it all feel interesting and fresh. It’s early days for now, but so far the signs are looking good for something special.  FINAL FANTASY XVI © 2023 SQUARE ENIX CO., LTD. All Rights Reserved.

Last Thursday (18 May), in a change to the usual schedule people were treated to the sight of popular comedian, Lee Mack, challenging three teams of three players in quiz show 3 by 3.  Loading…  However, things got messy when one of the contestants had her head blown up right as Mack was delivering his final address.  Advert 10  Quiz teams, The Three Tenors and Quiztopher Biggins, had already been knocked out by that point.  This left mother and daughter team, Margaret and Catherine Oakwood, to tackle the final round, with mum Margaret locked in a soundproof booth as they both had to get the right answers independent of each other.  However, after Margaret failed to get the final question correct, the Oakwoods failed to win the big money and that's when things went weird, as Margaret appeared to become trapped in the booth before her head exploded on camera.  Thursday night viewers got to see Lee Mack in new quiz show 3 by 3. Credit: BBC  Advert 10  Some channel-hopping viewers were left pretty shocked, taking to social media to talk about 'the SHOCK I got when her HEAD EXPLODED' - which is a pretty understandable reaction.  They can at least console themselves with the fact that none of it was real and it was all part of the show.  Regular Thursday night fans will have been aware that they were enjoying the latest offering from Inside No 9, the marvellously macabre series from Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton.  While fans had been expecting an On The Buses tribute episode titled 'Hold On Tight', they instead got '3 by 3', the first episode of Inside No 9 not to feature Shearsmith or Pemberton on camera.  Advert 10  Fans of the series reckoned that 'anyone who hasn't watched Inside No 9 before is in for a nasty shock', as for pretty much all of the episode it played the quiz show tropes completely straight.  Much of this owes itself to Lee Mack playing the role of quippy quiz show host perfectly, with plenty of jokes you'd expect him to make which some viewers were sure he's used on The 1% Club.  Margaret (Gemma Page) and Catherine (Saskia Wakefield) were the stars of the latest Inside No 9. Credit: BBC  As the episode progressed, it became clear that something was ever so slightly off with the Oakwoods, or more specifically Margaret (Gemma Page) and Catherine (Saskia Wakefield), as cricket-loving dad Stephen (James Tucker) was frozen out early on and never returned.  Advert 10  Catherine seemed to know the answer to every question despite revealing she'd basically no experience with entertainment or much of the outside world.  It's really to everyone's credit that Inside No 9 managed to keep up the pretence for so long, while weaving in so many brilliant clues as to what was really going on, the episode being incredibly rewarding on a rewatch.  At the end the episode there was a homage to the likes of Matilda and Carrie, with Catherine blowing up her mother's head after it was heavily implied her parents had kept her locked up as an experiment.  Mack didn't notice for a bit before all hell broke loose and the film crew fled the studio, with Catherine finally free of Margaret - even if she had to blow up her head to do it.  Advert 10  Here's hoping she made it to New Zealand.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhZGJpYmxlLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2JiYy12aWV3ZXJzLWxlZS1tYWNrLXF1aXotc2hvdy1pbnNpZGUtbm8tOS0zODEyMjAtMjAyMzA1MjLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Flight delays related to the presence of ash also were reported Monday.  CNN reported that millions were warned to prepare for possible evacuation Popocatépetl, as authorities closed schools in dozens of municipalities.  People were urged not to travel within a 7.5 mile radius of the volcano and to avoid the crater, “due to the danger of falling ballistic fragments,” according to Mexico’s National Center for Communication and Civil Protection Operations.  The volcano has experienced explosions, tremors and exhalations of vapor, gas and ashes for weeks, according to monitoring reports from the national center and the National Autonomous University of Mexico.  Ash fell across more than a dozen municipalities over the weekend.  Volcano Popocatepetl lies near Puebla, about 45 miles southwest of Mexico City.

People in the towns of Adrano and Biancavilla reported hearing loud booms from the volcano on Sunday  Activity frequently originates from multiple cones in the craters at Etna’s summit, according to the Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program and the US Geological Survey.  Lava flows were reported in January, and an explosion on May 14 produced an ash admission, the group stated.  Activity at Mount Etna has been observed and recorded for more than 2,500 years, making it one of the oldest continuously monitored volcanoes.  What happened at the Nyamulagira volcano?  Lava flowed on Saturday and Sunday from an ongoing eruption inside the Nyamulagira volcano, reported Charles Balagizi, a geochemist and geohazards researcher at the Goma Volcano Observatory in a Twitter post. The volcano is north of Goma, on the eastern side of the Democratic Republic of Congo near the border with Rwanda.  Nyamulagira is Africa's most active volcano.  It was releasing large quantities of sulphur dioxide over the weekend, Balagizi said.  He encouraged residents in the region to wash all vegetables before cooking.  An eruption began in the summit crater on March 14 and active flows were seen on May 7 and May 12, according to the Smithsonian's Global Volcanism Program.

"explosion","2025-07-26","Not Discerned","{""Marshall"", ""Michigan"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T15:29:48","Attorneys for the Bay Mills Indian Community (BMIC) on Friday submitted the Tribe’s final brief to the Michigan Public Service Commission, wrapping up nearly three years of litigation in a contested case over the proposed Line 5 tunnel project. The Commission must decide whether to grant a permit for Enbridge, a Canadian oil giant, to dig a pipeline tunnel beneath the Straits of Mackinac. This untested tunnel project could result in an explosion and release oil into the Great Lakes.  “After another round of testimony and cross-examination, the safety concerns about Enbridge’s proposed tunnel remain,” reads one brief. “And new concerns have emerged.”  During the case, a pipeline safety expert warned that the pipeline could rupture, releasing oil or natural gas liquids into the tunnel. The product and the associated flammable gases could ignite and trigger a massive explosion. Brian O’Mara, a geologist with decades of experience with tunnels, testified that the explosion could create a fuel-rich fire that would burn for days, causing the tunnel to collapse. Oil would spill into the heart of the Great Lakes, and any product stuck in the rock or sediments would slowly dissolve into the groundwater for decades or possibly centuries. These issues remain unaddressed by Enbridge.  “The tunnel project doesn’t solve the risks associated with oil flowing through the Great Lakes,” says Earthjustice attorney Julie Goodwin. “It just replaces one set of risks for another.”  No one has ever attempted to build a massive concrete tunnel to route a hazardous liquids pipeline underneath the Great Lakes—or anywhere. Evidence gathered over the last three years shows the experimental design of this project is significantly flawed and especially risky.  “The stakes are too high for the State of Michigan to gamble on catastrophe,” reads one of BMIC’s final briefs. “The possibility that this misguided project would rain devastation and destruction on the Great Lakes, and to Bay Mills and other communities, is simply too great of a risk.”  The proposed tunnel would lie beneath a place of deep spiritual, cultural, and economic importance to BMIC. In August 2020, BMIC intervened in Enbridge’s permit application, represented by attorneys at Earthjustice and the Native American Rights Fund (NARF). They were soon joined by several neighboring Tribes.  As BMIC President Whitney Gravelle testified: “My people, Bay Mills Indian Community, have had a longstanding historical relationship with the land and water in and around the Straits of Mackinac since time immemorial […] If that relationship is severed it can only mean that my people no longer have the ability to survive in this area any more – they could not hunt, they could not fish, they could not gather, they could not perform ceremony, they could not pass on teachings, and they could not use medicines to heal themselves. The list goes on and on. All it takes is one time and one spill to destroy my people and destroy all that we hold dear.”  Richard Kuprewicz, a chemical engineer with nearly fifty years of experience in the oil and gas industry, warned the Commission about the serious risk of an explosion in the tunnel. Alarmed by these warnings, the Commission re-opened the record in July of 2022 and ordered Enbridge to answer questions about the safety of the tunnel design.  “Instead of addressing the Commission’s well-founded concerns, Enbridge either ignored their questions or gave answers that were flawed, biased, and completely unsupported by actual numerical data,” said Earthjustice attorney Christopher Clark.  In one case, Enbridge provided an expert employed by the company’s software provider, who adjusted a risk probability calculation simply because of his faith in that software. In another instance, Enbridge failed to answer the Commission’s request for an assessment on the feasibility of using more protective electrical equipment. Instead, Enbridge gave excuses about the difficulty of doing feasibility exercises that they never bothered to perform, despite having nearly a year to complete them.  All parties now await the decision of the three-member Michigan Public Service Commission.  “The history of pipeline operations in this country is replete with examples of ruptures, leaks and explosions that have had devastating impact,” testified BMIC President Whitney Gravelle. “Undoubtedly, these events were regarded as highly unlikely to happen. And, too often, Indigenous people bear the brunt of such accidents.”  “This risky and unnecessary proposed pipeline tunnel project endangers treaty-protected rights of the Bay Mills Indian Community and places Tribal Nations and other frontline communities in dire risk of an oil spill,” added NARF Staff Attorney David L. Gover. “The Commission now has the critical information they need to make the right decision.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vZWFydGhqdXN0aWNlLm9yZy9wcmVzcy8yMDIzL2VuYnJpZGdlcy1saW5lLTUtdHVubmVsLWNvdWxkLXJhaW4tZGV2YXN0YXRpb24tYW5kLWRlc3RydWN0aW9uLW9uLWdyZWF0LWxha2Vz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Spread across seven 19th-century galleries in the north-east wing are 600 works out of the museum’s 800,000-strong collection that stretch from the 1840s to the present. There’s a lot – a lot of images and a lot of labels – but take your time and you’ll be duly rewarded.  Simone d’Aillencourt photographed by Richard Avedon in 1959. Photograph: Eksts, George/Victoria and Albert Museum  The first couple of galleries opened in 2018 and have been rehung with a focus on energy in photography. That’s as vague as it sounds, but the outcome is less muddled than you might think. I find myself lingering in front of Adolphe Braun’s still life of jostling flowers mid-bloom, and William Henry Fox Talbot’s delicate depictions of leaves and ferns. My favourite: the ghostly sciagraphs of reptiles taken by James Green and James H Gardiner in 1897, soon after X-rays were discovered, presented in a glass vitrine as if they’re real specimens ribbiting with life.  We go from froggy silhouettes to vast railways with soaring, whale-like roofs. Captured on camera are advances in cars, trains, planes. Disasters both natural (the eruption of Mount Vesuvius) and not (the atomic bomb). Moon landings. All hand in hand with advances in the medium: created without a camera, Man Ray’s Le Souffle (1931) is an experimental type of photograph achieved by placing a fan on light-sensitive paper. Unfolding chronologically, the display unravels the history of both photography and the world. Among the most poignant portraits are Bill Brandt’s sooty impressions of mining communities in northern England and Wales, and Dorothea Lange’s images of migrant families forced to abandon dried and damaged land in dust bowl America.  See something that piques your interest? Delve deeper in a gallery dedicated to photographic books. Since they first appeared in 1843, four years after the invention of photography was made public, such tomes have provided an alternative, more intimate way of looking. More than 20,000 books from the Royal Photographic Society’s library are available to visitors on request, while others are at your disposal on open shelves. I spy everything from Susan Sontag’s seminal collection On Photography and monographs on Diane Arbus and Nan Goldin to Kodak data books and Photo Lab indices.  Brian Griffin’s Big Bang, 1986. Photograph: Victoria and Albert Museum  My feeling is that it would have made sense to go straight from the opening galleries to the library, which takes so much of what we’ve seen so far and translates it to the page. Instead, we pass through a digital gallery housing a specially commissioned work that will change every six months. First up, The Zizi Show by Jake Elwes, an all-singing, all-dancing deepfake drag cabaret that draws attention to the bias in AI. With a colourful cast of kings, queens and more, the artist celebrates community and difference.  Jo Spence’s Libido Uprising, 1989. Photograph: Victoria and Albert Museum  That’s a thread that runs through the contemporary galleries, too. Recent acquisitions include a series of beautiful blue-tinged self-portraits by Tarrah Krajnak. Born in an orphanage in Peru in 1979 and adopted by Slovak Americans as a baby, in 2019 she projected media photos of the political upheaval that took place in her home country during the year of her birth on to her body. The result: a striking exploration of identity and a multi-layered historical narrative.  A colourful echo of the makeshift homes set up by those families photographed by Lange in the US, Gauri Gill’s 2020 series The Village on the Highway depicts the temporary dwellings assembled by rural workers on major routes into Delhi. Protesting new laws that threatened their livelihoods, and banned from entering the capital, they remained in lodgings fashioned from farming equipment for over a year, when eventually their voices were heard. Wrapping around a corner are carefully considered images of tarpaulin-topped trailers, camp beds, stoves. A bumper sticker behind an empty deckchair reads: “Good Luck.”  If you’re still not sure about how cameras work, you’ll find out in the final room, where you can experience the camera obscura. Step into a light room and your image will be projected upside down on to the wall of a dark room for others to see. A neat way to wrap up, and a reminder that the things we encounter every day on our smartphones aren’t exactly as they appear.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9hcnRhbmRkZXNpZ24vMjAyMy9tYXkvMjIvZXJ1cHRpb25zLWV4cGxvc2lvbnMtc2V4dWFsbHktZXhwbGljaXQtaG9vdmVyLXZhLXBob3RvZ3JhcGh5LWNlbnRyZS1yZXZpZXfSAX9odHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vYXJ0YW5kZGVzaWduLzIwMjMvbWF5LzIyL2VydXB0aW9ucy1leHBsb3Npb25zLXNleHVhbGx5LWV4cGxpY2l0LWhvb3Zlci12YS1waG90b2dyYXBoeS1jZW50cmUtcmV2aWV3?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(WLUC) - A fire destroyed a building at 209 Calumet St. on M-26 in Lake Linden Sunday night, however, no people were injured.  The Lake Linden Fire Chief says the fire happened near the corner of Calumet St. and 2nd St. Firefighters first responded just after 11:00 p.m. Sunday. It was described as an explosion by multiple callers.  “I was standing outside, about a block away,” said Lake Linden Resident Kim Taunton. “When I heard a loud boom, and then I saw a puff of smoke, and then I saw it light up with flames, so I ran out into the road, and I saw the fire on the garage.”  Taunton says there was a total of three separate explosions as it covered the garage. Once the garage caught fire, it quickly spread to the neighboring building.  “The garage was fully engulfed in flames, the stairwell to the building was fully engulfed in flames, and then the fire was on the roof of the big building here that’s now knocked down,” continued Taunton.  The fire chief described it as a very intense fire, with over 400,000 gallons of water used to put out the fire.  The first floor of the building is a former dentist’s office, with an apartment in the upper half. People who live on the second floor were out of town Sunday night, but a cat died in the fire.  The Lake Linden Volunteer Fire Department, Lake Linden Village Police, and eight or nine agencies from surrounding areas also responded. The cause of the fire is under investigation.  “There’s no indications right now of a natural gas leak or anything like that until the fire marshal can take a look at it and kinda make a determination of it,” said Lake Linden Fire Chief Andrew Kotila.  The state fire marshal is expected to visit the scene this week.  The scene was first cleared by 5:30 a.m. Monday. The Lake Linden Volunteer Fire Department returned at 6:00 a.m. and left again by 8:30 a.m. Some smoke may still be visible, but the fire chief says it’s just leftover steam.  TV6′s Houghton Hancock Bureau Reporter Colin Jackson is at the scene Monday and will have a full report on your TV6 Early News at 6:00 p.m. ET.

"explosion","2015-10-07","Not Discerned","{""Kharkiv"", ""Harkov"", ""Ukraine""}","2023-05-22T20:51:13","The Pentagon and the defense industry have initiated efforts to increase production of high-end explosives and such initiatives include reestablishing domestic supply chains and refurbishing factories, The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday.  The war in Ukraine has prompted the Department of Defense to expand the manufacturing and use of an explosive material called CL-20 to help address the “molecule gap” with China.  Developed during the 1980s, CL-20 has been used as a material in a warhead that equips AeroVironment-built Switchblade drones, which have been deployed in Ukraine to counter Russian forces.  According to the report, CL-20 could provide shells with greater range and generate a bigger explosion since it is up to 40 percent more powerful than older energetics.  Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., plans to advance CL-20 adoption by introducing an amendment to the fiscal 2024 defense policy measure that would require DOD to launch a pilot program that incorporates the explosive material into three of its preferred munitions or missile systems.  Sources said the utilization of CL-20 improved the lethality of the Switchblade drones deployed to Ukraine to counter tanks and other armored vehicles.  Gallagher added that the use of CL-20 in the Ukraine war effort helped back the case to expand the use of the explosive material.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vZXhlY3V0aXZlZ292LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1L3VrcmFpbmUtd2FyLXByb21wdHMtdXMtaW5kdXN0cnktZG9kLXRvLWludmVzdC1pbi1leHBsb3NpdmUtbWF0ZXJpYWwtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Satellite data is used to study volcanic activity and provide early warnings to the aviation industry.  This satellite image from the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission features the Japanese island of Nishinoshima, in the northwest Pacific Ocean.  One of the Ogasawara Islands, Nishinoshima is a small uninhabited volcanic island roughly 1000 km south of Tokyo. Volcanic activity along the western edge of the Pacific Ring of Fire gave rise to this island, which is in fact the tip of a submerged volcano.  Until 1974, only a part of the ridge of the otherwise submerged caldera was visible, and the island was about 700 m long and 200 m wide. Since then, Nishinoshima has experienced alternating periods of explosive activity and calm, but lava from various eruptions over the years has led to the island growing bigger.  This image was acquired in January 2021 and here the island is around 2.3 km in the north-south direction and 2 km in the east-west direction.  The yellowish discoloration of the water around the island is due to volcanic minerals, gas, and seafloor sediment that is being stirred up by the volcanic activity. It stretches for about 10 km to the southeast, where ocean currents turn it into bright green swirls.  A plume of gas and steam can be seen rising from the volcano and drifting northeast over the Pacific Ocean. As the plume rises higher, the steam condenses and forms clouds.  Volcanic plumes are of particular concern to the airline industry because ash can contaminate oxygen supplies and damage jet engines. Atmospheric sensors on satellites can identify the gases and aerosols released by eruptions, quantify their wider environmental impact, and can help provide early warnings to the aviation industry.  Satellite data can also be used to better understand volcanic activity. Optical and radar instruments can image lava flows, mudslides, ground fissures, and earthquakes, and be used to assess damage.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vc2NpdGVjaGRhaWx5LmNvbS9uaXNoaW5vc2hpbWEtamFwYW4tc2F0ZWxsaXRlLWNhcHR1cmVzLWEtZmllcnktaXNsYW5kcy1leHBsb3NpdmUtZ3Jvd3RoL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"explosion","2023-05-20","15:00:00","Not Discerned","2023-05-23T03:12:11","The weekend passed without any solar activity, but things are about to change. The highly unstable sunspot, AR3311, which was responsible for an X-class solar flare eruption last week that resulted in radio blackouts on Earth, can again explode to a terrifying effect. Unlike last time, right now the sunspot is in full Earth view and any eruptions will be geoeffective. This means a stronger ultraviolet radiation impact, which means a wider radio blackout, and a more powerful solar storm event. But just how devastating can the event be? Let us take a look.  As per a report by SpaceWeather.com, “Unstable sunspot AR3311 has a 'beta-gamma-delta' magnetic field that harbors energy for strong solar flares. NOAA forecasters say there is a 75% chance of M-class flares and a 30% chance of X-flares”. It is also not out of the question that multiple simultaneous eruptions take place, which can further complicate matters.  Sunspot feared to explode  We have not seen such a big sunspot harboring so much magnetic flux in a couple of months. However, the last such sunspot exploded multiple times before facing the Earth and did not explode while it remained geoeffective. But chances of similar luck are low this time around.  If the sunspot does explode and blasts an X-class solar flare, the resultant coronal mass ejection (CME) that escapes into space could be large enough to trigger even a G5-class geomagnetic storm. Such storms hitting the Earth can damage satellites, disrupt GPS, mobile networks, and internet connectivity, cause power grid failure, and even impact ground-based electronics.  NOAA's GOES-16 satellite in solar storm prediction  GOES-16, formerly known as GOES-R before reaching geostationary orbit, is the first of the GOES-R series of Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites operated by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It was launched on November 19, 2016, and became operational on December 18, 2017. GOES-16 is located in geostationary orbit over the Atlantic Ocean and provides continuous imagery and atmospheric measurements of Earth's Western Hemisphere. It also carries a lightning mapper, which can detect both cloud-to-cloud and cloud-to-ground lightning. GOES-16 is a vital tool for weather forecasting, climate monitoring, and space weather prediction.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3RlY2guaGluZHVzdGFudGltZXMuY29tL3RlY2gvbmV3cy9zb2xhci1zdG9ybS1hbGVydC1zdW5zcG90LWFib3V0LXRvLWV4cGxvZGUtc2hvd3Mtbm9hYS1zYXRlbGxpdGUtY2FuLWJsYXN0LXgtY2xhc3Mtc29sYXItZmxhcmVzLTcxNjg0ODExMjkxNTg4Lmh0bWzSAaABaHR0cHM6Ly90ZWNoLmhpbmR1c3RhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvdGVjaC9uZXdzL3NvbGFyLXN0b3JtLWFsZXJ0LXN1bnNwb3QtYWJvdXQtdG8tZXhwbG9kZS1zaG93cy1ub2FhLXNhdGVsbGl0ZS1jYW4tYmxhc3QteC1jbGFzcy1zb2xhci1mbGFyZXMtNzE2ODQ4MTEyOTE1ODguaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The backfield is stocked, particularly if Robinson hits the ground running as expected. London showed as a rookie he owns WR1 skills. Pitts has uber-athletic traits that make him a matchup nightmare from the TE spot. Smith fits better in this offense than he ever did in New England. There are depth questions in the receiver corps, but the top of the skill-position corps are stellar in a winnable NFC South.  ""However that comes, we just want to be explosive,"" Ridder said. ""Whether it's in the run game, the pass game, whatever it may be, obviously this is a game where you got to put points up on the board, and that's something that we want to do as an offense, all the while taking care of the ball, controlling the game, just doing what you have to do to go out there and win. So from the Falcons offense, we can just go out there, just play our hardest and expect to be explosive.""  The biggest question for Atlanta is whether Ridder is the guy under center. The 2022 third-round pick started four games down the stretch as a rookie. He had flashes, but there were also moments of struggle. He averaged 177 passing yards per game over the four contests with two touchdown tosses and zero interceptions.  This offseason, the Falcons doubled down on Ridder, only bringing in veteran Taylor Heinicke as a backup, eschewing the options to add legit competition for the second-year signal-caller.  ""It feels good knowing that they have the trust in me, that they've seen that I've put in the work and the effort as long as everyone else to go out there and lead the team,"" he said. ""Obviously throughout the offseason, you hear all the talks and everything.

Media Research Center Business charted the stories and language used following the multimillion-dollar grant and found that AP also used over 500 environmental extremism buzzwords in the stories.  POLITICAL AND MARKET PRESSURE INCREASES TO RAISE DEBT CEILING  The media giant, which feeds news outlets worldwide, received grants totaling $8 million from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Quadrivium, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Walton Family Foundation in February 2022.  AP said it would hire 20 new environmental writers with the money to create a climate swat team to “enhance the global understanding of climate change and its impact across the world.”  So far, it has lived up to its promise, said MRC Business, a branch of the conservative media watchdog.  In its study, provided to Secrets, MRC Business wrote, “The term ‘Climate Change’ itself appeared a whopping 212 times. ‘Warming’ and ‘Global Warming’ appeared 140 times collectively. ‘Extreme(s)’ emerged 32 times and ‘Disaster(s)’ and ‘Climate Disaster’ appeared a collective 30 times. One Dec. 9, 2022, AP story was headlined: ‘New abnormal: Climate disaster damage down to $268 billion.’”  Graphic courtesy MRC Business  AP pledged it would keep total control of stories despite the infusion of cash.  Reporting supported by philanthropic donations has increased recently as advertising has dried up. Even the New York Times uses it.  While reporters have expressed concern, editors have promised not to cave to the politics of donors. All those that provided the grant money to AP have been climate activists.  Hewlett, for example, said on its webpage that its grants “focus on cleaning up power production, using less oil, using energy more efficiently, preserving forests, addressing non-CO2 greenhouse gases, and financing climate-friendly investments.”  The MRC Business study authors wrote, “The so-called ‘journalism’ AP has been doing on climate involves behaving like the de facto mouthpiece for its major left-wing donors who have an obsession with pushing apocalyptic climate narratives on the internet.”  SEE THE LATEST POLITICAL NEWS AND BUZZ FROM WASHINGTON SECRETS  Washington Secrets works with MRC every Monday to come up with the best example of media bias for the weekly “Liberal Media Scream” feature. While the focus is usually politics, the feature includes ""woke"" politics, such as climate change extremism.  In its study, MRC Business highlighted one story about a United Nations report that included several climate buzzwords. “Deadly with extreme weather now, climate change is about to get so much worse,” it opened. “It is likely going to make the world sicker, hungrier, poorer, gloomier and way more dangerous in the next 18 years with an ‘unavoidable’ increase in risks, a new United Nations science report says,” it added.  MRC Business said that while the AP has noted its funding on related stories, a concern is that a partner does not also include that note.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25leGFtaW5lci5jb20vbmV3cy93YXNoaW5ndG9uLXNlY3JldHMvZXhwbG9zaW9uLW9mLWFwLWNsaW1hdGUtY2hhbmdlLXN0b3JpZXMtZm9sbG93aW5nLThtLWVudmlyby1ncmFudNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Burress, who was seated near the fireplace, suffered a laceration to her Achilles tendon and was later diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, according to her lawsuit.  She filed suit against the restaurant in 2021.  Advertisement  Her attorneys at Salvi, Schostok & Pritchard said the explosion was likely caused by a pinhole crack in the fireplace’s gas line. The fireplace, though, had been built in a way that made it impossible to inspect any of the gas lines, the law firm said.  “The gas lines of the fireplace that exploded had never been inspected since it was constructed eight years before the incident. If any kind of annual inspection had been performed, it would have revealed that the wrong kind of connection hose was used, and that there were signs of deterioration requiring replacement with the correct kind of gas line,” her attorney, John A. Mennie, said.  The restaurant should have made alterations to the masonry fireplace that would have permitted required annual inspections to take place, the suit alleged.

"explosion","2023-05-23","Not Discerned","{""Atlanta"", ""Georgia"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T03:00:00","Share Facebook  Twitter  A wet start to both the game and the series in Atlanta, as the Dodgers were greeted with a 40-minute rain delay.  Things eventually cleared up, and while that didn’t seem like a blessing early, the Dodgers rallied for a comeback against the Braves and end their short two game skid with an 8-6 victory.  ======  Gavin Stone‘s night started in basically the worst way possible, both for himself and for the current situation of the Dodgers, in general. He was greeted by a “double” that James Outman completely misread in center, and a one-out single by Sean Murphy blooped in front of Outman for the game’s first run. Stone then issued a walk to put a pair on, and Eddie Rosario continued to terrorize the Dodgers with a three-run homer to right to make it 4-0. While no more runs scored, Stone also allowed a walk and single after that and had to throw 34 pitches to get out of the 1st.  The only consolation to that start was the Dodgers started to get to Charlie Morton. He had a clean 1st, but J.D. Martinez started chipping away at the lead in the 2nd by smashing his 7th dinger of the year to make it 4-1.  After going down in order in the 3rd, Freddie Freeman led the 4th off with a double, Will Smith got robbed by Ronald Acuna Jr. in right to advanced him a base, then Freeman scored on a Max Muncy groundout. They weren’t done, and the Dodgers rarely are with two outs, as J.D. singled and David Peralta followed with a triple down the line in right to make it 4-3. A walk followed that, but Morton stopped the rally there.  *It was a triple. — Chad Moriyama (@ChadMoriyama) May 23, 2023  That was a foretelling what was to come in the 5th, as Miguel Rojas singled, Mookie Betts walked, and Freddie yoinked his 9th homer of the year down the line in right for a three-run shot, and all of a sudden the Dodgers were up 6-4.  K (but happy this time). pic.twitter.com/tvGW8o7xkP — Chad Moriyama (@ChadMoriyama) May 23, 2023  To Stone’s credit, he bounced back in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th innings, throwing just 37 pitches over that span and facing the minimum thanks to having a walk erased by a double play in the 3rd and a single erased by one in the 4th.  Unfortunately, as soon as he got the lead, he started the 5th with eight consecutive balls to walk a pair and led to his outing ending. That was made worse by Acuna stealing third on the walk due to the Dodgrs not paying attention.  4 IP, 5 H, 5 R, 5 BB, 1 K, 79 Pitches  Surprisingly, Dave Roberts went with Evan Phillips as the first guy out of the pen to navigate the trouble. He gave up a groundout that scored a run charged to Stone, then a double that put the go-ahead run in scoring position, but managed to escape the trouble from there.  To their credit, the Dodgers came right back to add insurance against the Braves pen in the 6th. Again with two outs, Rojas doubled to left and was scored by a Mookie single to put the lead back up to 7-5.  I think this is the first time showing this camera angle during the pitch has ever paid off. pic.twitter.com/FqqTNPmdNv — Chad Moriyama (@ChadMoriyama) May 23, 2023  The Dodgers added more to the ledger in the 7th with the second homer of the night for J.D., his 8th of the year. Of course, it could’ve been a two-run shot if Muncy hadn’t erased his own single with a caught stealing on the very previous pitch. Either way, it was 8-5.  Just Dingers is becoming a valid nickname. pic.twitter.com/2O49xYxHDB — Chad Moriyama (@ChadMoriyama) May 23, 2023  The bats managed just a walk (8th) and a single (9th) the rest of the way, and they could not add on further.  ——  The 6th for the Dodgers belonged to Caleb Ferguson, who faced the minimum after a single was erased by a double play. Yency Almonte was curiously given the heart of the Braves order in the 7th, and he got them in 1-2-3 fashion despite his recent struggles.  The 8th was more problematic, as Phil Bickford got two outs and allowed a single, which led to him being removed for some reason. Brusdar Graterol entered and immediately allowed a double to score a run before getting out of the frame.  8-6.  Graterol started the 9th with a 3-0 count, but battled back for a strikeout, then got a soft grounder and a check swing grounder to close the Braves out.  A surprisingly pleasant start.  ——  Will Smith and Marcell Ozuna got into an argument after Ozuna hit him with his backswing, something he does quiet frequently.

In a momentous astronomical event, esteemed Japanese astronomer Koichi Itagaki recently discovered a supernova, dubbed SN 2023ixf, in M101, which lies only about 21 million light-years away, making it the closest supernova seen in the past five years.  In case you have been living under a rock, supernovas are incredibly powerful and dramatic stellar explosions that take place at the end of a massive star's life cycle. They are among the most energetic events in the universe, releasing an enormous amount of energy and producing intense brightness that can outshine entire galaxies.  SN 2023ixf was detected merely three days ago and was subsequently located on automated images from the Zwicky Transient Facility two days earlier. It ranks as the second closest supernova observed within the past decade and marks the second supernova detected within M101 in the past 15 years.  The proximity of this cosmic spectacle presents a remarkable opportunity for researchers to delve into the intricacies of a supernova's birth. Initial findings indicate that SN 2023ixf belongs to the Type II supernova category - a cataclysmic occurrence that transpires when a massive star exhausts its nuclear fuel and succumbs to gravitational collapse.  Astronomers predict that SN 2023ixf will continue to brighten and remain visible to telescopes for several months, providing an extended window of opportunity for in-depth exploration. Studying the supernova in such close proximity may unlock valuable insights into the life cycles of massive stars and the processes that govern their explosive fates.  For the unversed, NASA's APOD features a different astronomical image each day, captured by ground-based and space-based telescopes, along with a detailed description provided by a professional astronomer.

Several social media users and even verified Twitter accounts posted pictures seemingly from the Pentagon in Washington D.C. that showed a lot of smoke at the scene. The images briefly spread like wildfire throughout Twitter, and some news outlets overseas ran with the story.  The problem? The images were generated by AI.  Even worse, those reports appear to have led to a massive selloff on Wall Street before the market corrected upon realization that the story - and the images - were fake.

Late in the afternoon of 21 July 1925, a premature explosion in a metal quarry at Bundamba, resulted in the death of John Sharpe and caused injuries to two other workers.  Mr Sharpe, a native of Ipswich, had worked in the quarry for about 35 years.  He was the eldest son of George Sharpe and his wife Jane.  John Sharpe had married Louisa Bertha Gillett on 16 April 1885, and they had six children.  As well as a widow he left behind his three sons and three daughters.  His sons were Walter Roland, Victor Henry and Cecil Ernest, and his daughters were Ida Adelaide (Mrs J Broom), Isabel Louise (Mrs H Routledge), and Olive Leah (Mrs J Sellars).  The Brisbane Council’s quarry was close to the Bundamba Creek and only a short distance from the Bundamba Railway Station.  The metal from this quarry was used for road making in Brisbane.  A number of other incidents occurred in or near this quarry.  These included a workman being hit on the head by a falling rock; a lad was drowned in the nearby Bundamba Creek; and in a 1929 report, the supply from the Brisbane Council’s quarries was in excess of the demand at that time.  This quarry was closed by early 1930.  ABOUT THE EXPLOSION  “The explosion occurred in the Brisbane Council’s quarry at about 4.45 p.m.  “A ‘down hole’ had been heavily charged with gelignite, and before the workmen could get clear, it suddenly exploded.  “Huge slabs of metal were blown from the face of the quarry, and John Sharpe, who was working nearby, was buried up to his hips.  “Arthur Gedge, the manager, who was still stemming the hole at the time of the accident, was blown completely off his feet, and Frank Hillard, another workman, was also bowled over.  “Assistance was readily forthcoming and Sharpe was soon extricated. The three injured men were taken to a neighbouring house, and meanwhile the ambulance was summoned.  “Sharpe and Gedge were admitted later to the General Hospital. Hillard was able to return home after having his wounds dressed.  “At 10.45 o’clock that night Sharpe’s life ebbed out.  “He was aged 62 and resided in Railway Street, Booval. His right leg was fractured and was badly torn about. “He also had lacerations on both arms and hands, and was suffering greatly from shock.  “Arthur Gedge was also a married man and a resident of Nimmo Street, Booval.

Though no casualty was reported due to the latest explosion which happened allegedly in the house of a local Trinamool Congress leader in Birbhum district, three members of a family were killed in a blast at an illegal firecracker factory in South 24 Parganas district on Sunday, police said.  The two back-to-back blasts followed a huge explosion that claimed 12 lives in another illegal firecracker factory in Purba Medinipur district on May 16. In order to make sure that such illegal factories do not exist any more, the state Cabinet decided to set up clusters for manufacturing green firecrackers industry and formed a committee headed by Chief Secretary HK Dwivedi to look into the matter, a senior minister said here.  Monday’s blast took place inside a house at Dubrajpur in Birbhum district but there is no casualty, police said. The house was partially damaged because of the explosion. ""We cannot say much about the matter. It's still in a very initial stage. The cause of the blast is not yet known,"" a police officer said. Locals, however, claimed that the house belonged to local TMC leader Sheikh Shafik and “crude bombs stored there exploded”.  In Sunday night’s explosion at an illegal firecracker manufacturing unit at Budge Budge in South 24 Parganas district, three members of a family, including a minor, were killed and several others were injured, police said on Monday.The three deceased persons are 65-year-old Jamuna Das, her daughter Pampa Ghati and her 10-year-old granddaughter Jayashree. The number of injured in the blast was, however, not specified. The state government ordered a CID probe into the incident, a senior official said. The state Cabinet gave its nod to form a panel to look into setting up clusters for manufacturing green firecrackers, an official said.  The chief secretary-headed committee will comprise secretaries of the departments of home, finance, fire services, environment and urban development, he added. Municipal Affairs Minister Firhad Hakim said that the decision was made so that people's livelihood is not affected. ""The committee will submit a report after examining all the aspects such as the place of the cluster, the number of people to be employed and the rules to be followed,"" he said. Meanwhile, a police officer said, ""It seems that the blast in Budge Budge occurred after the explosives illegally stored in the house caught fire, which probably spread from incense sticks lit in the evening in the puja room located on the terrace of the house,"" he said.  At least 30 people, allegedly running illegal firecracker manufacturing units in the locality, were arrested and around 20,000 kg of explosive materials stored in various houses were seized in police raids in the intervening night of Sunday and Monday, the official said. Some people in the area, however, claimed that the explosives were ""purchased legally"". ""We have the license for manufacturing firecrackers. We had legally purchased all those explosive materials seized by the police. This will ruin our livelihood,"" said Sajal Das, the owner of a firecracker manufacturing unit in the locality. Budge Budge area has a thriving fireworks industry. BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari mocked the state government after the blast and as in the case of the Egra blast, demanded an NIA probe into the incident.  He also alleged that the state police had tampered with evidence in the night while conducting the raid.On May 16, an explosion had taken place at an illegal firecracker manufacturing unit at Egra in Purba Medinipur district in which 12 people lost their lives. The main accused in the Egra blast died at a hospital at Cuttack in Odisha on May 19.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5vdXRsb29raW5kaWEuY29tL25hdGlvbmFsL3Nlcmllcy1vZi1pbGxlZ2FsLWZpcmVjcmFja2VyLWJsYXN0cy1yb2NrLXdlc3QtYmVuZ2FsLXRoaXJkLWV4cGxvc2lvbi13aXRoaW4tYS13ZWVrLW5ld3MtMjg4NTg20gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Bellingcat journalist Nick Waters tweeted that there are a few signs that make it an AI image, including that the fence melds into the crowd barriers on the image and there are no other images or videos being posted on social media.  Advertisement  This image was quickly retweeted by many different accounts, some crediting “Twitter sources” as the original source. While some of the accounts that tweeted it out either apologized or deleted the image—@BloombergFeed was suspended—it continued to be shared by accounts that had blue checks thanks to Twitter's pay-to-play verification system. The stock market even briefly dipped due to the fake news.  Within an hour of it being circulated, government officials stepped in to clarify that the tweets were fake news. The Arlington Fire & EMS tweeted, “There is NO explosion or incident taking place at or near the Pentagon reservation, and there is no immediate danger or hazards to the public.”  The spreading of this fake news across accounts that have up to a million followers and blue checks raises more alarm bells on how Twitter’s current structure as a result of Elon Musks’s ownership can expedite a misinformation campaign. Verification checks were once a marker of authenticity, but under Musk's leadership, the blue checkmark now is merely a symbol that the account owner subscribes to Twitter Blue, which is Twitter’s premium plan.  This isn’t the first time that misinformation has spread from blue-check accounts since Musk took over the social media platform. In early May, several verified Twitter accounts falsely said that Russian military jets were being armed with nuclear payloads and aimed at Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpY2UuY29tL2VuX3VzL2FydGljbGUvN2t4ODRiL2FpLWdlbmVyYXRlZC1wZW50YWdvbi1leHBsb3Npb24taG9heC10d2l0dGVy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

People are giving of themselves and coming to the room with good intentions.”  “No one is selling the foundational values of the country,” he added. “In-depth discussions are being held about the boundaries between the branches of government. This is how it should be, since for 75 years we did not deal with this.”  “If I see any malicious acts done to sabotage the process, I will not hesitate to point them out,” Herzog said. “It is true that there are a lot of [interested parties] outside of the room who are not enjoying that we are holding dialogue within the room. But within the room, we are holding serious, significant and responsible dialogue for the good of the nation and the country.”  Legislation of the judicial reforms, which would strengthen the government in the balance of power between it and the judiciary, was frozen on March 27 after widespread protests and a general strike.

"explosion","2023-03-14","Not Discerned","{""Rotterdam"", ""ZuidHolland"", ""Netherlands""}","2023-05-23T06:12:00","The lower house of the Dutch parliament passed a bill that gives mayors the legal authority to temporarily evict residents and close houses when there is a chance of a shooting or explosion at the home. Currently, mayors can do that only through emergency decrees, NOS reports.  The emergency decree closures don’t always hold up in court because the decree states that there must be severe nuisance in the home itself. The Dutch mayors asked for clearer rules. The many explosions at homes in cities like Amsterdam and Rotterdam are now a structural problem, and mayors have to close more and more houses. Clear legislation is needed, the mayors of the four large cities stressed.  There have been over 50 explosions and shootings at Rotterdam homes so far this year. The Amsterdam counter stood at 42 in the first four months of 2023. Mayors try to avert the danger to targeted residents and their neighbors and return peace to the neighborhood by temporarily evicting residents and closing the targeted home.  Mayors will still always determine on a case-by-case basis whether eviction is really necessary, Utrecht mayor Sharon DIjksma said on behalf of the four large Dutch cities. “It is one of the most far-reaching powers you have as a mayor. You can’t take it lightly. But if there’s a real danger to neighbors or unsuspecting passers-by, sometimes you have to take these kinds of measures,” she said. With the new law, courts will still check whether the closure is justified.  According to the Utrecht mayor, this new law is badly needed, but more is necessary to counter the wave of attacks on homes. “Camera surveillance costs tons, and it also takes a lot of capacity to view all the images,” Dijksma said. The police don’t have the capacity to detect all threats and prevent all attacks. “Actually, you want to be ahead of this type of crime.”  The mayors asked for more people and resources from the State to tackle these crimes. They also want the government to make information exchange between the Public Prosecution Service and municipalities easier so that they can take measures in time.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vbmx0aW1lcy5ubC8yMDIzLzA1LzIzL25ldy1sYXctYWxsb3dzLW1heW9ycy1ldmljdC1wZW9wbGUtc2hvb3RpbmctZXhwbG9zaW9uLXRocmVhdGVucy1ob21l0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"explosion","2023-05-18","Not Discerned","{""West"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T11:51:00","After dealing with some unusual monsoon rains in South Texas this Spring the region is experiencing a bloom of the mosquito population.  Mosquitoes in South Texas are a public health concern due to the transmission of diseases. Mosquitoes are known to carry and be a vector of various diseases to humans.  In South Texas, the most significant concern is the transmission of diseases such as West Nile virus, dengue fever, Zika virus, and chikungunya. These diseases can cause severe illness, and, in some cases, they can be fatal. The presence of a large mosquito population increases the risk of disease transmission to the local population.  In addition to mosquitoes being a threat to public health, the bloodsuckers are also a public nuisance. In areas with a high mosquito population, outdoor activities such as gardening, sports, and picnics can be spoiled with the bites which cause itching and swelling. This can have a negative impact on the quality of life for residents and visitors in South Texas.  Some individuals may have allergic reactions to mosquito bites, which can range from mild irritation to more severe allergic responses. Excessive scratching of mosquito bites can also lead to secondary infections, further complicating the issue.  South Texas communities often implement mosquito control programs, which involve surveillance, larvicide treatments, and public education about mosquito bite prevention. These efforts aim to reduce mosquito populations and minimize the risk of disease transmission.  There are several steps individuals can take to help reduce the mosquito population in their surroundings, including removing standing water. Mosquitoes breed in stagnant water, so it's essential to eliminate any potential breeding sites. Regularly empty, clean, or cover containers that can collect water, such as buckets, flower pots, birdbaths, and discarded tires. Keep gutters clean and ensure they drain properly. Fix any leaks or standing water issues around your property.  Mosquito repellents applied to exposed skin can bring some protection—especially when spending prolonged time outdoors, especially during peak mosquito activity times like dawn and dusk. Look for repellents containing ingredients such as DEET, picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), which are effective against mosquitoes.  Protective clothing is also a preventative measure against prevalent mosquitoes. Wearing long-sleeved shirts, long pants, and socks can help minimize exposure to mosquito bites. Consider wearing light-colored clothing, as mosquitoes are attracted to dark colors.  Regularly mow your lawn and trim vegetation to reduce mosquito resting areas. Mosquitoes often hide in tall grass and shrubs during the day. Remove any leaf litter, as it can accumulate water and become a breeding ground for mosquitoes. Consider using mosquito-repelling plants, such as citronella, marigolds, and lavender, in your landscaping.

"explosion","2023-10-23","Not Discerned","{""LosAngeles"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T23:16:00","GELFAND’S WORLD - If you live in the city of Los Angeles, you live in risk of fire or explosion due to the presence of refineries, manufacturing plants, and the harbor. Gasoline is carried on tanker trucks throughout the city, and of course there are the natural gas pipelines. As we have recently seen from a railway incident in Ohio, people can be put at risk from any number of things. Just imagine the effects of a toxic release of fluorine, a liquid petroleum tank spill, or a derailment.  So let me take up a concern I have been voicing over the past decade. As a San Pedro resident, I have been asking about the prospect of a necessary evacuation should there be some sort of toxic gas release from the port or an out-of-control refinery fire. I was always told that they have a plan, but they couldn't tell me the exact details and routes because evacuations are designed on the spot, and necessarily involve a lot of local details, the type of fire or explosion, and so forth.  I was always a little skeptical of these responses. Maybe I was just getting a canned answer to a standard question. This past weekend, the Los Angeles Fire Department put their money where their mouth is and showed us how such an evacuation would be designed and practiced. The answer came in the form of a seminar at the Harbor City Recreation Center which taught about the process of mass evacuation.  What did I learn?  The exercise was ostensibly about a tanker truck overturning and catching fire on the 110 Freeway. No, the LAFD did not shut down the freeway, although they joked about the level of complaints they would have had to face had they done so. Instead, we engaged in what you might think of as a thought experiment. This was carried out in front of the locals at the Harbor City Recreation Center, which is just a few blocks from the 110, and would have been affected by toxic gas had there been a real incident.  Various officials from the Fire Department talked about their duties in controlling such an event and trying to save lives. I can't testify to the veracity of what I was told because I am not a fire fighter, but the core of what we heard is that the people in the department are in training basically every day of their working lives. They think about gasoline fires and how to handle them, they think about an explosion such as happened in San Pedro back in the 1970s, and they think about dock fires. Then they drill.  We heard essentially this same description from three or four officers from different agencies including LAFD, LAPD, the Highway Patrol, and the city's Emergency Management Department.  We were told that the process of evacuating people depends on the circumstances, which include what kind of disaster or toxic release is happening, how many people live nearby (and exactly where), and what routes exist for getting people out of the area. We heard something similar from each of the speakers, told from their particular agency's perspective.  Designing and ordering an evacuation can be critically dependent on things like whether the main road out of the area is engulfed in flame or under water, and how many cars you can move through any one point in the next few hours. Readers will remember that evacuation of parts of Malibu by way of Pacific Coast Highway during the recent fire was an example, in the sense that thousands of people evacuated with little loss of life, and most of them griped about how slow the traffic moved.  In this exercise, the LAFD considered the question of getting people evacuated from the neighborhood around the recreation center where we were meeting. They created a map showing how people could evacuate in any of 4 directions -- north, east, south, and west, because that is how the streets are laid out -- and how they would connect with cross streets as part of their evacuation. They put together a flier labeled ""Sample Evacuation Routes"" and handed them out. We've tried to provide you with a reproduction of that map in order to show the result of such an exercise.  In total, this was a useful exercise, in that the public (including me) got to hear a pretty intensive presentation from a lot of different officials from LAFD, one refinery official, the LAPD, and even the CHP. Even the vastly important but underfunded Emergency Management Department was there to explain their mission.  The main complaint about the event came from the highest ranking LAFD officials, who explained that they were disappointed that they did not have hundreds of people in attendance. It's a fair statement, but you've got to start somewhere. This presentation, slightly modified, should be taken to other parts of town. I would like to see a slimmed down version (this one went on for over two hours) presented in San Pedro. I would suspect that other parts of town which have their own natural barriers (Baldwin Hills because of those hills, for example, and the obvious canyon areas along Hollywood and the coastline) be included in the list. And No, I can't tell them how to cut the presentation to an hour, or maybe 80 minutes, but I'm sure that with a little practice this is doable. It helped that they gave out coffee.  The Last Picture Show  Continuing our explorations along Route 110, even if we don't have a song to go along:  There is an old fashioned movie theater, the kind that a few of us will remember from our youth, that still exists in Gardena. It has suddenly gotten media attention, such as the article you can read here . We dropped by the theater to get a feel for this historical charm, and was invited in by Judy Kim, the manager that you can read about in the Times article cited above.  It turns out that because this theater screens first run Hollywood blockbusters, they have to keep it going seven days a week. And apparently, most of the studios require that you show a first run film at least twice a day. There was, in fact, a brand new film involving fast cars and wild driving, the popcorn was hot, and the place is a bit like an old theater back when there were lots of them and they were new.  Kim is proud of the fact that they have a giant parking lot immediately adjacent to the theater, and it is free. Think about that, the next time you drive through Hollywood or down Wilshire.  It turns out that Judy Kim's parents bought the theater back in the '70s, and she is now doing most of the management. Gardena locals are supportive of her efforts, although it is obviously a challenge to keep an old fashioned theater going nowadays. Judy has an interesting history of her own, having gone to law school and fighting a legal action that allowed her to buy the parking lot next to the theater.  We were impressed by how neat and clean the lobby is, particularly in comparison to other old theaters that have been allowed to fall into disrepair or converted into a flea market.  I should point out that there is a small but active community that works to keep old theaters alive. There have been successes in Fullerton, for example. Let's hope that Gardena stays among their number.  Gardena cinema, 14948 Crenshaw Blvd, Gardena, 90249, near the intersection of the 105 and the 110. Schedules can be found here .

Gail Mitchell filed legal docs claiming she barely used NutriBullet's Original 24 oz. Single Speed Black Jar Blender for 60 seconds when the machine exploded ... sending the scalding hot contents onto her body, causing painful burning to her chest, arms, scalp, and face.  The photos of her alleged injuries look pretty gnarly ... Gail's arms are covered in burn wounds and her skin is now super scarred. She also claims the explosion left her kitchen a mess too.  According to the lawsuit, obtained by TMZ, Mitchell says the incident happened in November 2020 when she was whipping up a smoothie using turmeric, ginger, water, mango and split peas.  Mitchell says she was standing in front of her NutriBullet, looking for a cup to pour her smoothie into when the machine exploded less than 1 minute after she fired it up.  In the docs, Mitchell says the blender explosion made the contents of the smoothie scalding hot, leaving her with 1st, 2nd and 3rd-degree burns ... and she says she had to go to a burn center every week for a month for treatments.  She claims the device's design can cause contents in the blender to become heated to dangerous temperatures. She says the high-speed motor operating the blades creates heat that is transferred into the canister and its contents, sometimes heating the contents to dangerous temps. She also says the rapidly spinning blades create friction, creating heat that is also transferred to the contents of the canister, sometimes heating the contents to dangerous temps as well.

The camera processes data and sends it to a gateway device. And so, de facto edge computing grows as more processing continues at different layers of the technology stack.  Because processing occurs throughout the IT environment, some refer to this configuration as “fog computing.” CDW has assisted the city of Opelika, Ala., in recently moving to this model with Cisco Meraki products. Previously, the city would stream camera data back to a central server, which would eat up bandwidth. The volume of this data could be overwhelming. And the stream slowed traffic speed and reduced the bandwidth available to other solutions.  Now, the city can process data in the camera, where it is stored. Administrators manage data in the cloud, accessing it only when required, thereby relieving network tension.  There is also an inherent cybersecurity benefit to this arrangement. Classic video surveillance required streaming back to a centralized command. Live video streaming so much data could subject it to insider security vulnerabilities. However, edge or fog computing enables data access on demand, which means there is no constant video stream.  Video accessed in smaller doses is less available to security breaches.  READ MORE: How mission-critical operations centers improve public safety.  Edge Devices Enable Smart City Applications  Video cameras on the edge do more than simply capture images. Cameras and other sensors aid in smart city applications, including people counting and traffic management. Officials can determine how many citizens or vehicles are in a specific space and react with public safety or other measures as required.  Some edge computing devices track cell phone use, and some track drones. Environmental sensors in edge devices can monitor the weather and natural disasters as well as air quality. All of these solutions can provide insight into the health and safety conditions of a city.  Modernized supervisory control and data acquisition mechanisms also make significant use of edge computing. It is a boon to utilities to process data through SCADA devices and smart meters to meet their customers where they live. Smart cities will only see more legacy devices join the Internet of Things, where they can contribute to a distributed computing environment. This also relieves potential congestion in network traffic.  In the near future, cities will capitalize on edge computing for applications such as autonomous vehicles and augmented reality. We’ve seen pilot programs for exactly these use cases: Peachtree Corners, Ga., runs an autonomous shuttle through its business district, and Coral Gables, Fla., uses augmented reality to help visitors navigate the city.  There is no limit to what cities can do with edge computing. Officials are no longer restrained by the linear thinking of traditional hub-and-spoke computer models.

"explosion","2023-05-23","09:30:00","{""Arlington"", ""Virginia"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T21:22:50","An image of black smoke billowing next to a bureaucratic-looking building spread across social media Monday morning, with the claim that it showed an explosion near the Pentagon.  The posts sent a brief shiver through the stock market as they were quickly picked up by news outlets outside the U.S., before officials jumped in to clarify that no blast actually took place and the photo was a fake.  Experts say the viral image had telltale signs of an AI-generated forgery, and its popularity underscores the everyday chaos these now increasingly sophisticated and easy-to-access programs can inflict.  Here’s a closer look at the facts.  CLAIM: An image shows an explosion near the Pentagon.  THE FACTS: Police and fire officials in Arlington, Virginia, say the image is not real and there was no incident at the U.S. Department of Defense headquarters across the Potomac from the nation’s capital.  Despite this, the image and claim was spread by outlets including RT, a Russian government-backed media company formerly known as Russia Today. It was also widely shared in investment circles, including an account bearing Twitter's signature blue verification check mark that falsely suggested it was associated with Bloomberg News.  “Reports of an explosion near the Pentagon in Washington DC,” the Russian state news agency wrote in a since-deleted tweet to its more than three million followers.  RT confirmed it took down the tweet and “covered the official position from the Pentagon on the matter” after verifying the reports were inaccurate.  “As with fast-paced news verification, we made the public aware of reports circulating and once provenance and veracity were ascertained, we took appropriate steps to correct the reporting,"" the company wrote in an emailed statement Tuesday.  Still the timing of the fake image, which appeared to spread widely just after the U.S. stock market opened for trading at 9:30 a.m., was enough to send a ripple through the investment world.  The S&P 500 briefly dropped a modest 0.3% as social media accounts and investment websites popular with day traders repeated the false claims.  Other investments also moved in ways that typically occur when fear enters the market. Prices for U.S. Treasury bonds and gold, for example, briefly began to climb, suggesting investors were looking for someplace safer to park their money.  The image's rapid spread prompted the Arlington County Fire Department to take to social media to knock down the rumors.  “@PFPAOfficial and the ACFD are aware of a social media report circulating online about an explosion near the Pentagon,” the agency wrote, referring to the acronym for the Pentagon Force Protection Agency that polices the Pentagon. “There is NO explosion or incident taking place at or near the Pentagon reservation, and there is no immediate danger or hazards to the public.”  Capt. Nate Hiner, a spokesperson for the fire department, confirmed the agency’s tweet was authentic but declined to comment further, deferring to the Pentagon police force, which didn’t respond to email and phone messages.  Misinformation experts say the fake image was likely created using generative artificial intelligence programs, which have allowed increasingly realistic, but oftentimes flawed, visuals to flood the internet recently.  Inconsistencies in the building, fence and surrounding area are imperfections typically found in AI-generated images, noted Hany Farid, a computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who specializes in digital forensics, misinformation and image analysis.  “Specifically, the grass and concrete fade into each other, the fence is irregular, there is a strange black pole that is protruding out of the front of the sidewalk but is also part of the fence,” he wrote in an email. “The windows in the building are inconsistent with photos of the Pentagon that you can find online.”  Chirag Shah, co-director of the Center for Responsibility in AI Systems & Experiences at the University of Washington in Seattle, cautioned that spotting fakes won’t always be as obvious.  Society will need to lean more on “crowdsourcing and community vigilance to weed out bad information and arrive at the truth” as AI technology improves, he argued.  “Simply relying on detection tools or social media posts are not going to be enough,” Shah wrote in an email.  Before the explosion hoax, the biggest Beltway intrigue on Wall Street’s mind Monday morning was whether the U.S. government will avoid a disastrous default on its debt.  But as the market is becoming increasingly reactive to headline-grabbing news, misinformation can be especially damaging when it’s shared by outlets even vaguely deemed as credible, said Adam Kobeissi, editor-in-chief at The Kobeissi Letter, an industry publication.  “A lot of these moves are happening because of high frequency trading, algorithmic trading, which is basically taking headlines, synthesizing them and then breaking them down into a trade on a millisecond basis,” he explained by phone, noting that much of the market is now automated. “It’s basically like you’re pulling a trigger every time a headline comes out.”  Associated Press business reporters Stan Choe and Wyatte Grantham-Philips in New York contributed to this story.  This is part of AP’s effort to address widely shared misinformation, including work with outside companies and organizations to add factual context to misleading content that is circulating online.

"explosion","2023-04-12","Not Discerned","{""Beirut"", ""Beirut"", ""Lebanon""}","2023-05-22T14:20:00","About 60,000 pounds of a chemical used as both a fertilizer and an explosive is missing after likely disappearing during a rail trip from Wyoming to California last month, according to federal records.  A rail car carrying ammonium nitrate left a plant operated by explosives manufacturer Dyno Nobel in Cheyenne, Wyoming, on April 12, according to an incident report filed May 10 by a representative of the company with the National Response Center.  The report states the chemical was released ""due to an unknown cause,"" and was discovered missing after the rail car arrived in Saltdale, California, an unincorporated community more than 1,000 miles from Cheyenne.  At the time of the report, the car was empty and on its way back to Wyoming, according to the company.  Ammonium nitrate has been a key ingredient in both terror attacks and fatal accidents.  At least 581 people were killed in 1947 when more than 2,000 tons of the chemical exploded on a cargo ship that had docked at a port in Texas City, Texas. The same year, in Brest, France, a Norwegian ship that contained about 3,000 tons of ammonium nitrate exploded, leading to 29 deaths.  It was also used in a 1970 bombing on the University of Wisconsin–Madison campus that led to one death and several injuries, and in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, which killed 168 people.  In 2013, ammonium nitrate was the cause of an explosion at a fertilizer plant in West, Texas, killing 15 people, injuring 200 and wiping out hundreds of homes. Federal officials later found the blast was a “criminal act.”  In 2020, it was the source of a colossal explosion in Beirut, Lebanon, when more than 2,700 tons of ammonium nitrate detonated, killing more than 200 people and injuring thousands.  “It’s a very common chemical that anybody that has used fertilizer has dealt with routinely and doesn’t think anything about it,” said Nathan Lewis, a chemistry professor at the California Institute of Technology, told NBC News following the Beirut explosion.  “Just give it a little fuel, and you’re asking for trouble, and that’s what apparently happened,” Lewis said of the incident in Lebanon.  But a California law enforcement source familiar with the case told NBC News the recent disappearance of the chemical does not appear to be connected to any domestic terrorism threat.  The agencies that would examine a potential threat to homeland security are not among the main investigative agencies involved in the case, the source said.  A representative for the National Transportation Safety Board did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FBI also did not have any immediate comment.  A spokesperson for the Federal Railroad Administration said that Union Pacific's ""initial findings suggest this was likely a leak caused by a component of the rail car.""  ""Rail shippers and railroads are responsible for ensuring rail cars are properly secured and the FRA will continue investigating to determine if the railroad or shipper committed any federal violations under DOT’s regulatory authority,"" the FRA spokesperson added.  The spokesperson added that Union Pacific and Dyno Nobel ""should engage all necessary parties, including law enforcement, to ensure any potential causes and impacts are addressed swiftly and thoroughly.""  Representatives for Dyno Nobel and the California Public Utilities Commission did not respond to requests.  Kristen South, a spokesperson for Union Pacific, the rail company transporting the chemical, said in a statement that the disappearance of the chemical should not threaten the public.  ""The fertilizer is designed for ground application and quick soil absorption. If the loss resulted from a railcar leak over the course of transportation from origin to destination, the release should pose no risk to public health or the environment,"" South said, adding that the company's investigation into the incident “is in its early stages.”  ""At this point in the investigation, we do not believe there is any criminal or malicious activity involved,"" South added.  A representative for Dyno Nobel told KQED, the California news outlet that first reported the incident, that company representatives believe the chemical leaked through the rail car while in transit.  “The railcar was sealed when it left the Cheyenne facility, and the seals were still intact when it arrived in Saltdale. The initial assessment is that a leak through the bottom gate on the railcar may have developed in transit,” the spokesperson told KQED.  The route, which spans more than 1,000 miles through long stretches of remote territory in the western United States, will make it somewhat challenging to pinpoint the missing cargo or how it may have been released, sources said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvdXMtbmV3cy8zMC10b25zLWV4cGxvc2l2ZS1jaGVtaWNhbC1sb3N0LXJhaWwtc2hpcG1lbnQtb2ZmaWNpYWxzLXNheS1yY25hODU1MjbSASpodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYmNuZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FtcC9yY25hODU1MjY?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"explosion","2016-07-03","13:00:00","{""Kingston"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T18:27:44","KINGSTON — The severe injuries suffered by a Kingston man when a destructive device exploded in his basement yesterday are a stark reminder to leave fireworks to the professionals, said Kingston Fire Chief Mark R. Douglass, Kingston Police Chief Maurice J. Splaine, State Fire Marshal Peter J. Ostroskey, and Massachusetts State Police Colonel John E. Mawn, Jr.  The Kingston Fire Department and Kingston Police Department responded to the area of 8 Nobadeer Circle shortly after 1:00 yesterday afternoon following a 9-1-1 call. On arrival, they located an adult male suffering severe injuries to his hands, abdomen, and face. The man was transported by MedFlight to a Boston hospital and is expected to survive.  Based on the nature of the incident and items observed at the scene, fire investigators and bomb technicians from the State Police Fire & Explosion Investigation Unit assigned to the State Fire Marshal’s office responded to the scene. Hazmat technicians from the Department of Fire Services’ Joint Hazard Incident Response Team and State troopers from the Crime Scene Services Section also responded. Kingston and state officials observed, identified, and removed two destructive devices, as well as components that could be used to create additional devices.  While the preliminary investigation suggests the injured man intended to use the devices as fireworks, the items and substances involved were extremely dangerous – and illegal.  “In the past 10 years, fireworks have caused nearly 1,000 significant fires and explosions in Massachusetts, along with dozens of injuries and about $2.5 million in damage,” said Chief Douglass. “Please, for your own safety and the safety of your family, friends, and neighbors, leave fireworks to the professionals.”  “The possession, use, and sale of fireworks are illegal in Massachusetts even if they’re bought legally in another state,” said Chief Splaine. “State law requires that illegal fireworks be seized and destroyed. Don’t risk a fine and a day in court – leave fireworks to the professionals.”  Last year, joint enforcement efforts by the Massachusetts State Police and Department of Fire Services led to about 40 criminal summonses for violating the state’s fireworks laws. They also took off the streets nearly 3,000 packages of aerial shells, cakes, fountains, bottle rockets, large rockets, Roman candles, sparklers, and other dangerous, illegal devices worth upward of $46,000. Those enforcement efforts will resume this year. The investigation into yesterday’s incident is ongoing.  ###","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc3MuZ292L25ld3Mva2luZ3N0b24tZXhwbG9zaW9uLXByb21wdHMtcmVtaW5kZXItbGVhdmUtZmlyZXdvcmtzLXRvLXRoZS1wcm9mZXNzaW9uYWxz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

""There is NO explosion or incident taking place at or near the Pentagon reservation, and there is no immediate danger or hazards to the public,"" the Department of Defense's Pentagon Force Protection Agency and the Arlington County fire department said in a joint statement on Twitter.  The fake image circulating on Twitter showed a black cloud of smoke near a building. The accounts posting it claimed it depicted the Pentagon.  But the image was likely generated by artificial intelligence, experts said, in an example of potential for misuse of the increasingly popular and prevalent technology that they have been worried about.  ""Check out the frontage of the building, and the way the fence melds into the crowd barriers. There's also no other images, videos or people posting as first hand witnesses,"" Nick Waters of the open-source investigations group Bellingcat wrote on Twitter.  Soon, other apparently fake AI images purporting to show an explosion at the White House popped up.  Major stock market indices briefly dipped on the false reports before recovering.  Many of the Twitter accounts that spread the hoax carried blue checks, which used to signify that the social network had verified the account is who or what it claims to be. But under new owner Elon Musk, the company now gives a blue check to any account that pays for a monthly Twitter Blue subscription.  Among the blue-check accounts that shared the false Pentagon image were an one impersonating Bloomberg News and the real account of the Kremlin-linked Russian news service RT.  RT later deleted its post. The fake Bloomberg account has been suspended by Twitter.

"explosion","2019-04-11","10:03:00","{""Arlington"", ""Virginia"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T21:20:04","A fake image purporting to show an explosion near the Pentagon briefly went viral on Twitter on Monday, leaving fact-checkers to scramble to counter the false claim as it was pushed by a variety of verified accounts.  The image, which depicts a large plume of smoke next to a rectangular building with only a passing resemblance to the Pentagon, was shared by a series of verified news and open-source intelligence Twitter accounts. As of late April, verified users on Twitter are people who have paid $8 per month for the company’s “Blue” subscription service, which gives users a blue check mark along with some other perks, but the service no longer confirms the user’s identity.  The image appears to have first been shared on Twitter by an account with the handle @CBKNews121 at 8:42 a.m. ET. That account, which is verified, includes a variety of iconography associated with conspiracy theories, including John F. Kennedy Jr. as its profile picture. QAnon believers falsely claim John F. Kennedy Jr. faked his own death and will run for vice president with Donald Trump in 2024.  Shortly after posting the image, CBKNews posted a tweet supporting QAnon.  “Watch #ElonMusk for the next 60 days. Q. Big,” the account tweeted.  CBKNews did not respond to a request for comment on Twitter and later deleted the Pentagon explosion tweet. John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the Citizen Lab, which is based out of the Munk School of Global Affairs & Public Policy at the University of Toronto, tweeted that the image showed signs of having been generated by artificial intelligence.  Before it was deleted, the image took on a life of its own.  RT, Russia’s official propaganda outlet, tweeted at 10:03 a.m. ET about “reports of an explosion near the Pentagon.”  A business news aggregation influencer with over 650,000 followers on Twitter who is best known for posting Bloomberg News headlines posted about a “Large Explosion near The Pentagon Complex” at 10:06 a.m. That account later deleted the tweet, but not until after racking up hundreds of retweets.  The spread of the tweet appeared to spook some investors. The S&P 500 dropped sharply in the minutes after the image was amplified by well-followed accounts. It later recovered those losses.  Shortly after that tweet, the anonymous Wall Street news blog ZeroHedge posted the fake Pentagon explosion image to the account’s 1.6 million followers, along with the caption “EXPLOSION NEAR PENTAGON.” ZeroHedge later deleted the tweet.  By this point, fake news organizations on Twitter that had purchased “verified” check marks began to push the hoax. The account @BloombergFeed, which is unaffiliated with Bloomberg, posted the conspiracy theory minutes later. That account has since been suspended by Twitter.  Around 10:27 a.m. ET, the Arlington, Virginia, fire department tweeted that “there is NO explosion or incident taking place at or near the Pentagon.”  Nick Waters, an investigator at the digital investigations firm Bellingcat, told NBC News that the panic around the image “never made any sense.”  “There are quite a few red flags in this picture,” Waters said. “When you try to actually place this picture in space and geolocate it, you can’t because it’s not a real place. It’s not a building that’s anywhere in Washington authentically.”  Waters also noted that the fences in front of the fake building morph and meld into one another.  After the fake Pentagon image went viral Monday morning, a copycat hoaxer pushed a similar image of the White House on fire. Waters noted that the image didn’t take off in quite the same way the Pentagon image did, in part because “it didn’t look anything like the White House.”  “AI is still really not great at producing accurate locations, and you can really tell that from the picture,” Waters said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY25ld3MuY29tL3RlY2gvbWlzaW5mb3JtYXRpb24vZmFrZS1waWN0dXJlLWV4cGxvc2lvbi1wZW50YWdvbi1zcG9va3MtdHdpdHRlci1yY25hODU2NTnSASpodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYmNuZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FtcC9yY25hODU2NTk?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

A specialised explosives firm has spent the past few days searching for old war ammunition under the tracks in Wildert near Essen, where a German ammunition train exploded eighty years ago.  On 9 September 1944, a German ammunition train came under fire from US fighter-bombers. The train exploded in Wildert. Damage to the infrastructure was repaired, but a lot of ammunition still lined the track, eventually finding its nickname the ‘Bomb Trail’.  “Previous works on that stretch of track were limited to renewing the rails so as not to manipulate the ground too much. But now, eighty years after the explosion of the ammunition train, the sleepers and shingles of the ‘Bomb Track’ over a distance of some 150 metres also need to be renewed,” says Infrabel spokeswoman Britt Monten.  To be on the safe side, Infrabel called in a specialised explosives firm to have the remaining old war ammunition under the track removed first.  The track was taken out of service on Wednesday night, after which Infrabel specialists removed the tracks, sleepers and pebbles.  “After that, detectors were used to scan the ground. Layer by layer was carefully excavated to a depth of 60 centimetres below the tracks. When ammunition was found, the DOVO demining service was notified. A total of two canisters and about 10 burnt-out shells were found and defused. During the clean-up, access to the site was strictly limited,” said Britt Monten.  Now that this delicate operation is over, reconstruction by Infrabel will follow. By 4am Monday morning, the tracks, sleepers and shingle should be renewed. SNCB is running replacement buses in the meantime.  During the Whitsun weekend, Infrabel will carry out additional work on the ‘Bommensenspoor’. This mainly involves so-called revisions and checks on the stability of the track.  Work is also continuing on modernising the railway infrastructure at other locations (Essen, Kalmthout, Kapellen, Mariaburg and Antwerp-Luchtbal).","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJydXNzZWxzdGltZXMuY29tLzUxMzIyMi9zZWNvbmQtd29ybGQtd2FyLWFtbXVuaXRpb24tc2FmZWx5LXJlbW92ZWQtZnJvbS11bmRlci1hbnR3ZXJwLWVzc2VuLXJhaWx3YXktbGluZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

OpenAI bled around $540 million last year as it developed ChatGPT and says it needs $100 billion to meet its ambitions, according to industry media The Information.  ""We're going to be the most capital-intensive startup in Silicon Valley history,"" OpenAI's founder Sam Altman told a panel recently.  And when Microsoft, which poured billions of dollars in investment into OpenAI, is asked about how much its AI adventure will cost, the company answers with assurances that it is keeping an eye on its bottom line.  (For top technology news of the day, subscribe to our tech newsletter Today’s Cache)  Building something even near the scale of what OpenAI, Microsoft or Google have on offer would require an eye-watering investment on state-of-the-art chips and recruiting prize-winning researchers.  ""People don't realize that to do a significant amount of AI things like ChatGPT takes huge amounts of processing power. And training those models can cost tens of millions of dollars,"" said Jack Gold, an independent analyst.  ""How many companies can actually afford to go out and buy 10,000 Nvidia H100 systems that go for tens of thousands of dollars a piece?"" asked Gold.  The answer is pretty much no one and in tech, if you can't build the infrastructure, you rent it and that is what companies already do massively by outsourcing their computing needs to Microsoft, Google and Amazon's AWS.  And with the advent of generative AI, this dependency on cloud computing and tech giants deepens, leaving the same players in the driver's seat, experts warned.  The unpredictable costs of cloud computing, ""is a heavily underestimated problem for many companies,"" said Stefan Sigg, Chief Product Officer at Software AG, which develops software for businesses.  Sigg compares cloud costs to electricity bills and says companies that don't know better are in for ""a big surprise"" if they let their engineers run up bills in the mad rush to build tech, including AI.  Microsoft's signature cloud offer is Azure and some observers believe the giant's all-in bet on AI is really about protecting Azure success and guaranteeing the cash cow's future.  Azure has been the giant's unsexy bread-winner for years, bringing in huge profits but without attracting the headlines of an iPhone or social media that go straight to the consumer.  For Microsoft, ""the golden goose is monetising cloud with Azure because we're talking about what could be a $20, $30, $40 billion opportunity annually down the road if the AI bet is successful,"" said Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities.  Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella insists that generative AI is ""moving fast in the right direction.""  Deeply respected on Wall Street, Nadella will have a six- or nine-month grace period to show his bet is a winner, Ives predicted.  Microsoft acknowledges the risk, but insists that on AI, it must ""lead this wave,"" CFO Amy Hood told analysts this month.  ""We will charge for those AI capabilities, and then ultimately, we'll deliver operating profit,"" she said.  Piling up profit at the company founded by Bill Gates can only mean passing on the cost of AI to customers.  From Main Street to Fortune 500, the dependency on the AI-amped will be an expensive one and companies and investors are drumming up alternatives to at least reduce the bill.  ""AI training, GPT training will become a very important cloud service going forward,"" said Spectro Cloud CEO Tenry Fu.  His company, like many others in the sector, helps companies optimise cloud technology to reduce expenses.  ""But after training, a company will be able to get their model back for real AI application"" and the dependence on the cloud giants will hopefully be reduced, he added.  Regulators are hoping that they can keep up, and not leave the giants in charge, imposing their terms on smaller companies.  ""Law enforcers (must) ensure that... opportunities and openings for competition... are not getting squashed out by the incumbents,"" FTC chairwoman Lina Khan told CNBC.  But it might be too late, at least when it comes to which companies have the means to provide the groundwork of generative AI.  ""It is absolutely true that the number of companies that can train the true frontier models is going to be small just because of the resources required,"" OpenAI's Altman told a US Senate panel on Tuesday.  ""And so I think there needs to be incredible scrutiny on us and our competitors,"" he added.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhpbmR1LmNvbS9zY2ktdGVjaC90ZWNobm9sb2d5L2RhcmstY2xvdWQtb3Zlci1jaGF0Z3B0LXJldm9sdXRpb24tY29zdC9hcnRpY2xlNjY4Nzk2OTYuZWNl0gFtaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlaGluZHUuY29tL3NjaS10ZWNoL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvZGFyay1jbG91ZC1vdmVyLWNoYXRncHQtcmV2b2x1dGlvbi1jb3N0L2FydGljbGU2Njg3OTY5Ni5lY2UvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Advocacy group Media Diversity Australia (MDA) launched its Online Safety of Diverse Journalists research, conducted by Griffith University and Macquarie University on 2 May, exposing the vile harassment regularly directed at reporters who are Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander, and/or queer or transgender, and/or culturally and linguistically diverse, and/or living with a disability  The ABC was a sponsor and partner of the work but lead academic Faith Valencia-Forrester has claimed the public broadcaster “distanced itself from the report (no longer wanting to be a project partner)” at the 11th hour when the findings were provided.  In a post on LinkedIn, Valencia-Forrester claimed the ABC “no longer [wanted] to be a project partner after reading the report, where we mention hostile and unsupportive newsrooms”.  ADVERTISEMENT  Today, an ABC spokesperson strenuously denied the claims and said its social media wellbeing advisor was closely involved in the development of the research, management attended the launch, and it was mentioned in an MDA media release promoting the findings.  “This claim is untrue, deeply disappointing and should be retracted,” a spokesperson said in a statement. “The ABC has never tried to ‘distance’ itself from this research in any way – in fact completely the opposite.  “The ABC helped fund the research, along with the eSafety Commissioner, Meta, Google News Initiative and Twitter, and strongly supported it.  “The ABC logo is in the report itself, it was on display at the launch on the title screen, we were acknowledged multiple times as a partner in the launch and participated in an official partner photo.  “In fact, initially the MDA report into online abuse was going to focus on gender. It was the ABC’s team that indicated the impact on CALD and Indigenous journalists was an area where little research had been done.”  It’s understood that apart from factual corrections to a draft report, the only other representation made by the ABC was that MDA make clear that the report was its own independent work.  An email sent to the organisation by the ABC read: “The ABC is happy to be acknowledged as one of the funding partners of the research, just not to have the ABC name/logo used in a way which might suggest this is an ABC report, or an ABC-endorsed report, rather than an entirely independent MDA report.”  In a response to a query from Mumbrella, MDA boss Mariam Veiszadeh noted the academic team is independent of her organisation. Late on Monday morning, Valencia-Forrester made an update to her original statement to read: “The report sponsor Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) [UPDATED corrected for clarity], changed from project partner to ‘supporter’ after reading the report where we mention hostile and unsupportive newsrooms experienced by diverse journalists.”  The Australian media sector is still reeling from Grant’s revelation on Friday that he is stepping away from the ABC.  The acclaimed journalist and proud Wiradjuri man penned an emotional op-ed detailing the latest barrage of racist, violent and threatening messages directed at him – seemingly in response to his appearance on the ABC’s coverage of King Charles III’s coronation.  That abuse had bled into real life, with threats made against him and his family, he said.  Grant also attacked elements of the media who he had seen “lie and distort my words… they have tried to depict me as hate filled.”  “I don’t take time out because of racism… I take time out because we have shown again that our history — our hard truth — is too big, too fragile, and too precious for the media.  “I am writing this not because I think it will make a difference. No doubt the haters will twist this, too, and trigger another round of racism.”  And he accused senior management at the ABC of failing to support him, writing: “Not one ABC executive has publicly refuted the lies written or spoken about me. I don’t hold any individual responsible; this is an institutional failure.”  On Sunday, ABC managing director David Anderson addressed that claim and Grant’s exit in a lengthy email to staff, in which he said he was “dismayed” by the “sickening” abuse and harassment.  Despite Grant’s claims, he said “he has always had our full support”.  The ABC will now launch a review of how it responds to racism affecting staff and what it can do to better support staff, Anderson said.  Indigenous reporter Dan Bourchier, who chairs the ABC’s Bonner Committee, welcomed the review but said: “We will be seeking for this to be led by an independent expert, in collaboration with the Bonner Committee, and all other staff representation groups.”  In a statement posted to LinkedIn, Bourchier said: “We see this as an important next step in addressing the treatment some of our colleagues are facing.”  Tonight’s Q&A will be Grant’s last as host, with The Australian’s media section this morning reporting Patricia Karvelas is then set to step in as an interim host.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vbXVtYnJlbGxhLmNvbS5hdS9hYmMtZGVuaWVzLWNsYWltLWl0LWlnbm9yZWQtcmVzZWFyY2gtaW50by1vbmxpbmUtYWJ1c2Utb2YtZGl2ZXJzZS1qb3VybmFsaXN0cy03ODc4NzTSAXFodHRwczovL211bWJyZWxsYS5jb20uYXUvYWJjLWRlbmllcy1jbGFpbS1pdC1pZ25vcmVkLXJlc2VhcmNoLWludG8tb25saW5lLWFidXNlLW9mLWRpdmVyc2Utam91cm5hbGlzdHMtNzg3ODc0L2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"explosion","2023-05-25","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T15:28:00","An eruption of memecoins and nonfungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain has reshaped the revenue profile of miners and stirred questions about how lasting the upheaval will prove to be.  New software known as Ordinals paved the way for the NFTs and meme tokens to come to the network this year. Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd. says the Bitcoin NFT ecosystem could be worth $4.5 billion by 2025, while about 25,000 memecoins have been tallied on the blockchain since they first emerged in March.  The NFT and meme-token craze spurred record transactions and an ensuing fee windfall for miners, who run the computers underpinning Bitcoin. At one point in May, transaction fees made up over 40% of revenues, whereas miner income is usually dominated by the new Bitcoin they get for securing the blockchain.  “The Ordinals protocol has stimulated a seismic shift in the Bitcoin mining landscape,” said Jihan Wu, chairman of Singapore-based Bitdeer Technologies Group, one of the top crypto miners by computer power.  Ordinals and a crypto rebound have eased the pressure on mining margins caused by last year’s digital-asset rout and high energy costs. But Bitcoin purists argue the Ordinals phenomenon clogs the network and interferes with the largest cryptocurrency’s store-of-value and payments functions.  The mean fee per transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain began April at $2.80, reached $30 on May 8 and moderated to $6 on May 18, CryptoQuant data show. Total fee income attributable to Ordinals stands at about $37.4 million, according to data compiled by Dune Analytics AS.  Developer Casey Rodarmor created Ordinals, a software protocol that lets users inscribe digital content like videos, images and text on satoshis, the smallest unit of Bitcoin. There are 100 million satoshis in one Bitcoin.  Rodarmor’s innovation then allowed a pseudonymous blockchain analyst called Domo to develop the Bitcoin Request for Comment — or BRC-20 — standard, which led to the explosion of memecoins.  The durability of the sudden ardor for NFTs, or digital collectibles, and speculative tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain remains an open question. The market value of the memecoins was heading toward $1 billion earlier in May but has since declined to about $582 million, figures from BRC-20.io show.  The BRC-20 tokens have no utility, said Carlos Gonzalez Campo, a research analyst at crypto exchange-traded product provider 21Shares AG.  The fundamental takeaway may be that Ordinals has created a pathway to uses of the Bitcoin network that didn’t exist before.  “While the memecoin frenzy on Bitcoin will likely subside eventually, valuable use cases will emerge from the chaos, such as utilizing Bitcoin as a data availability layer and storing crucial documents that require permanent preservation,” said Sami Kassab, a research analyst at Messari.  Shares Rally  A sustained boost to transaction income could help sustain the Bitcoin network longer term by keeping miners engaged. Transactions will be the sole revenue source by about 2140, when Bitcoin is due to hit its cap of 21 million tokens and new coins will no longer be issued in return for securing the blockchain.  For now, Ordinals is helping to fuel renewed investor enthusiasm for Bitcoin miners. The 20-member MVIS Global Digital Assets Mining Index is up 110% so far in 2023, outstripping Bitcoin’s 74% advance.  The application of ordinals is “completely rewriting how people think about mining profitability,” said Colin Harper, head of content and research at crypto-mining services provider Luxor Technologies.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8yMS9tZW1lY29pbnMtbmZ0cy1lcnVwdC1vbi1iaXRjb2luLWJsb2NrY2hhaW4tc2Vpc21pYy1zaGlmdC1mb3ItbWluZXJzL9IBZ2h0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8yMS9tZW1lY29pbnMtbmZ0cy1lcnVwdC1vbi1iaXRjb2luLWJsb2NrY2hhaW4tc2Vpc21pYy1zaGlmdC1mb3ItbWluZXJzL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

With this win, they have now secured much needed 16 points, which helped them to create their spot in the fourth position, and now they will be eyeing the fixture between Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) and Gujarat Titans (GT) in Bengaluru, where they will be praying for GT to win this encounter, as this will pave the way for MI to the playoffs.  MI captain Rohit Sharma won the toss and invited SRH to bat first, but the Hyderabad-based team took advantage by scoring a strong total of 200/5 in their given 20 overs, all courtesy of the batting prowess of Mayank Agarwal and Vivrant Sharma.  While chasing in this very crucial encounter, the Mumbai-based team had a very edgy start, as SRH drew the first blood, as Bhuvneshwar Kumar got the wicket of Ishan Kishan (14) in the third over, but today, it was Cameron Green (100)* who stood tall for his side in this very important fixture. He scored a heroic ton which had eight fours and eight sixes. He first build a partnership of 128 runs with the skipper Rohit (56), and then knit a 53 runs partnership with Suryakumar Yadav (25)*, and chased the target of 201 runs in the 19th over.  Once again, it was a very disappointing day for the Hyderabad bowlers, as Bhuvneshwar and Mayank Dagar were the only wicket-takers.  In the first innings, Hyderabad started very well on a good batting deck at Wankhede, where both the openers Mayank (83) and his new batting partner, Vivrant (69) built a massive opening partnership of 140 runs. This partnership set a formidable base for the team to set up a score of 200+ runs. However, the partnership was broken in the 14th over, when the young pacer, Akash Madhwal got rid of Vivrant. Mayank also got out in the 17th over, as he was dismissed by Madhwal, and there were wickets falling in quick succession. But a last ball six by the skipper Aiden Markram (13)* helped the 2016 champions to get to the 200 mark.  With the ball for MI, Madhwal was the star with the ball, as he secured four wickets, whereas Chris Jordan got one wicket as well.  For his explosive century, Cameron Green has been adjudged Player of the Match.  Scorecard:  Sunrisers Hyderabad: 200/5, Overs 20, Mayank Agarwal 83, Akash Madhwal 4/37  Mumbai Indians: 201/2, Overs 18, Cameron Green 100*, Bhuvneshwar Kumar 1/26","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzbWludG1lZGlhLmNvbS9pcGwtMjAyMy1taS12cy1zcmgtZ3JlZW5zLWV4cGxvc2l2ZS10b24tcmVuZGVycy1hLW11Y2gtbmVlZGVkLXdpbi10by1taS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The 40-year-old, who wished to remain anonymous, required skin grafts to his right leg after burns to seven per cent of his body left him in hospital for two weeks.  “Although the burns team were fantastic, burns is a horrific and terrifying experience,” the man said.  “To all the kids out there, look at what happened to me; respect yourself, respect your life.  “100 per cent don’t start vaping in the first place — it was the worst thing I ever did.”  The horrifying images have been used by the AMA to highlight the dangers of vaping and e-cigarettes, supporting recent Federal Government reforms.  One in six teenagers aged 14-17 has used vapes in Australia, compared with one in four in the 18-24 age group.  AMA WA president Dr Mark Duncan-Smith said vaping was the new nicotine business delivery model of big tobacco.  Camera Icon The man required skin grafts to his right leg.

"explosion","1993-05-23","Not Discerned","{""LasVegas"", ""Nevada"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T09:00:00","Last year, the United States reached an important milestone, as electric heating became the most-used source of home heating in the country. Just 30 years ago, only 25% of homes used electric heating. This is happening because of the explosion in popularity of clean energy building appliances called heat pumps, which run on electricity and provide both highly efficient space heating and cooling. The U.S. now ranks second in the world in growth of heat pump sales, trailing only Europe.  This tectonic shift in the energy systems we choose to power the spaces where we live, work and play is taking root and is ready to flourish in Southern Nevada, too. Our region is primed for clean energy and building electrification that will use the latest in advanced clean energy technologies. Architects, designers, engineers, developers and professional experts are excited about the possibilities that clean energy and building electrification offer to our communities, because they create spaces that offer the best quality of life. In addition to creating indoor air quality that’s safer and healthier, all-electric buildings help lower energy use, save money on utility bills, and achieve significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.  Southern Nevada’s architects and developers are helping lead this transition in buildings you’ll see throughout our region. Our professional and technical expertise help show our elected officials that clean energy, solar panels and heat pumps aren’t just snazzy design concepts or a passing fad.  For example, TSK Architects is incorporating large-scale solar and storage in its public facilities projects, while improving the buildings’ energy performance and ensuring the air the public breathes indoors is clean and healthy. Development firm MultiGreen Properties is focused on building attainable, sustainable and tech-enabled housing. KME Architects, a minority-owned firm, is designing projects that use heat pumps, insulation that improves energy efficiency, and solar energy systems with on-site storage, and smart thermostats. And Ovation Development has integrated both solar and heat pumps in its “Home Means Nevada” projects, which retrofit affordable housing with energy-saving technologies.  Heat pumps’ efficiency is mind-boggling — they transform 1 kilowatt hour of electricity into up to 4 kilowatt hours of heating or cooling — which leads to steep drops in energy use. Heat pumps’ extremely high efficiency also helps keep power bills lower year-round.  Recent studies have shown that all-electric homes in Las Vegas are $1,347 cheaper to build and result in $279 in annual savings in utility bills for homeowners, while lowering greenhouse gas emissions by 46% over a 15-year period. New federal incentives are beginning to roll out in 2023 and will be a huge help for low- to moderate-income residents to electrify, but more state-level programs will be needed to remove cost barriers and ease the retrofit process for homeowners, property owners and tenants.  With the hottest months of summer on the horizon, we must start preparing now. Climate change is causing more extreme heat waves to occur in the summer, and low-efficiency air conditioning units are a threat to overload power grids. Modern highly efficient electric heat pumps are 60% more efficient than traditional window air conditioning units in the summer, making them an ideal solution for adding cooling to 100% of homes in Nevada. Moving from an old, inefficient air conditioner to a high-efficiency heat pump can reduce energy use by up to 50% — lowering energy bills for households while reducing strain on our electricity grid.  As the latest report from the United Nations’ top climate scientists showed, we need to move away from fossil fuels and onto clean energy much faster. Its statement that we’re walking when we should be sprinting is a call that all of us in Nevada can heed, and architects and developers can help lead.  Major appliance manufacturers, the building industry and policymakers in our state need certainty that transitioning buildings to clean energy is both feasible and widely beneficial. With expertise and many decades of experience, Southern Nevada’s architects and developers are trusted voices to deliver the facts and inform the decisions that will help make all of our buildings all-electric.

And a just metaphor: That venture meant to exceed nature, the Space X rocket, aiming to fly around the moon and return, made an explosion worthy of at least four Fourth of Julys over the Gulf of Mexico. A “rapid, unscheduled disassembly,” the engineers said.  In short, it blew up. And to my great pleasure, some other less grand but no less seemingly stolid factions are working their way to their much-deserved ends. From the count of the prosecutors now actively interested in his past behavior, it would seem that the reign of Donald Trump is also drawing to a close.  There will always be a line beyond which it is forbidden to step. More often than not, dictators mistake their brief cloud of fame and personal exaltation as permission to cross it. For me, Trump crossed on that January day on which he stood before an army of angry citizens armed with bear spray, pikes, flagpoles, and bicycle racks, pointed his neatly gloved finger in the direction of the U.S. Capitol, and urged them to march down that Mall and fight.  They did. And destroyed property. And, while fighting their way into the Capitol past seriously underprepared Capitol Police, they killed some people. And when order was finally restored, many in the mob were charged, jailed, tried, and convicted.  But not Donald Trump or his henchmen. And for some of his adherents, though it may be too painful for them to admit, watching him walk away a free man burst the disco ball. Scattered in those shards were the fantasies of prosperity and justice served, stoked by Fox News, that had nurtured many a man through a bleak winter evening.  The times, they are a-changing, they used to sing. And they surely have, and changed and changed once more, until now we are left with the dregs of a bender in an amoral abyss, led on by a man who could boast of groping women in their most private parts and yet be elected president.  But temporary madness will run its course. Trump may yet feel the weight of his actions. And much of what has been a national indulgence in the world of the demeaning insult and the filthy word has reached its limit.

It has started happening already. At the weekend, the Sharks dismantled the Cheetahs in an absorbing top-of-the-table contest, while the derby between the Bulls and the Lions was a fantastic game of rugby.  Remember Cheetahs coach Hawies Fourie two months ago predicted that the last month of the Currie Cup would be hotly contested as it became the main focus and he was right. The Bulls and Lions are fielding the strongest teams they can — bearing in mind the Springboks are not available — and the Sharks have something special building under their hungry young coach Joey Mongalo.  Western Province are fighting hard and their big defeat of the Pumas at the Athlone Stadium on Friday has put them into fourth place on the table. It was a costly lapse by Jimmy Stonehouse’s champions and they drop to third place.  There are three rounds left until the semi-finals for Province to consolidate that place but the fifth-placed Bulls are on the charge, and even the Lions can still make it although they would have to win all three of their remaining games. Last year’s finalists, the Pumas and Griquas, are showing signs of strain as they come up against stronger teams than was the case last year when the URC teams did not release as many fringe players. The Sharks’ bonus-point victory over the Cheetahs puts them on the same number of log points as the Cheetahs but they are second on points difference.

"explosion","2023-05-22","Not Discerned","{""Dhaka"", ""Dhaka"", ""Bangladesh""}","2023-05-21T18:00:00","Additionally, some ACs are prone to overheating if left running for prolonged periods due to the excessive strain on electrical components.  Likewise, power surges or low voltage can cause electrical malfunctions and result in a faulty unit.  Air conditioners (ACs) are seen as a luxury item in Bangladesh, with the prevalence of such cooling technology seldom seen outside of affluent homes.  However, what if your unit becomes a ticking time bomb? This is a scary thought, to say the least, as nothing could be more frightening than enjoying a good night's rest only to be rudely awoken by a deafening explosion.  Even so, this is the best-case scenario as one could be easily injured or even killed if the explosion occurs in close proximity.  In August last year, a couple died while three of their family members suffered injuries when an AC exploded at their house in Rajapur upazila of Jhalakathi.  In October 2021, two workers sustained burns in a fire believed to have originated from an AC exploding at a restaurant in Dhaka's Ashkona area.  Similarly, one person died, and at least six others were injured after an AC exploded at a high-rise in Dhaka's Gulshan earlier that same year.  However, the deadliest incident in recent times came in September 2020, when at least 12 people were killed after six ACs exploded in a mosque on the outskirts of Dhaka.  This begs the question, what exactly causes an AC to explode?  A major cause is leaking refrigerant, which can ignite if sparked.  Also, poor maintenance on the owner's part can lead to a build-up of dirt and debris in the absence of regular servicing, which leads to blockages that can cause the unit to overheat and potentially explode.  This mostly happens during winter, when ACs are kept off for weeks on end without any form of upkeep.  Additionally, some ACs are prone to overheating if left running for prolonged periods due to the excessive strain on electrical components.  Likewise, power surges or low voltage can cause electrical malfunctions and result in a faulty unit.  So, what can be done to prevent such incidents in your own home? To put it simply: ensure that your AC is properly maintained through regular check-ups. Besides, this reduces the chances of leaks occurring due to excessive pressure on major components amid rising temperatures.  Also, keep in mind that ACs should not be kept running for extended periods while technicians should be called immediately should the unit emit any strange noise or smell.  Incidents of AC explosions are happening in many places and with the way temperatures are constantly rising, it is very important to ensure that units are operated as per the safety guidelines, according to Md Nurul Afsar, deputy managing director of Electro Mart Limited, which markets Gree ACs.  ""Keeping this in mind, Gree AC has always adopted advanced technology,"" he said.  In addition, they have coated vital components in polyester powder so that the unit remains free of any rust of weather damage in any weather.  This doubly ensures that the condensers never leak, meaning that there is no chance of an accident, Afsar added.  He went on to say that a major reason for ACs to malfunction is electric fluctuations or short circuits while using the incorrect type of refrigerant in the unit also plays a part..  ""So, we made the circuit of Gree ACs fireproof with glue coating. Also, we are using environmentally friendly R32 gas in our units,"" Afsar said.  Gree ACs also have an auto-cleaning function, which reduces the servicing requirement to just once a year.  ""And to make our customers free of worry even in this regard, we provide free servicing once a year,"" he added.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5c3Rhci5uZXQvc3VwcGxlbWVudHMvYWMtbWFya2V0LWJhbmdsYWRlc2gvbmV3cy9ndWlkZS1zYWZlLWFpci1jb25kaXRpb25pbmctMzMyNjI0MdIBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5c3Rhci5uZXQvc3VwcGxlbWVudHMvYWMtbWFya2V0LWJhbmdsYWRlc2gvbmV3cy9ndWlkZS1zYWZlLWFpci1jb25kaXRpb25pbmctMzMyNjI0MT9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Photo/Sputnik  KIEV – Ukraine make fun of Russia after top Moscow officials claimed a warehouse containing British-supplied depleted uranium ammunition in Ukraine exploded. The claim was deemed unproven bullshit.  Moscow’s claim came out from the Secretary of the Russian Security Council Nikolai Patrushev on Friday last week. He warned that a cloud of radioactivity was heading towards Western Europe after the destruction of a Ukrainian warehouse holding depleted uranium (DU) munitions.  The Ukrainian Prosecutor’s Telegram channel mocked Patrushev, calling him a “candidate for medalists in nuclear physics”.  “Maybe Patrushev forgot to put on his glasses, and didn’t see that his uranium was depleted, and therefore a radioactive cloud couldn’t come out of him,” the Ukrainian prosecutor teased, as quoted by the Daily Star, Monday (22/5/2023).  Patrushev, one of President Vladimir Putin’s closest aides, previously claimed that an ammunition depot containing DU in Ukraine exploded after being attacked by Russian forces.  The claim was later circulated by Russian state media.  Patrushev said the DU ammunition depot that exploded was in Khmelnytskyi, western Ukraine, roughly 150 miles from the city of Lviv near the Polish border.  He claimed flames soared into the sky from the shelling and a fiery mushroom cloud emerged from the damaged facility after the attack.  “Their destruction caused the radioactive cloud to now move towards Western Europe,” said Patrushev. “And Poland has recorded an increase in radiation.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJ1ZXRpci5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS9kZXBsZXRlZC11cmFuaXVtLWV4cGxvc2lvbi1jbGFpbXMtaW4tdWtyYWluZS1qdXN0LWJvb2JzLXJ1c3NpYS1tYWtlcy1mdW4tb2Yv0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucnVldGlyLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1L2RlcGxldGVkLXVyYW5pdW0tZXhwbG9zaW9uLWNsYWltcy1pbi11a3JhaW5lLWp1c3QtYm9vYnMtcnVzc2lhLW1ha2VzLWZ1bi1vZi9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Fortunately, TikTokers have discovered a way to microwave eggs that avoids any kind of explosion, and it's a lot like the usual poached eggs recipe. According to a TikTok posted by Funny People Making Food, this method is as simple as cracking your egg into a microwave-safe bowl and then adding water. Host Erica Wides recommends half an inch to an inch of water –- however much it takes to fully submerge your egg –- and then microwaving on high for 35-50 seconds.  Though the addition of water should be enough to keep your egg from exploding in the microwave, you can further reduce the risk by pricking the yolk with a toothpick prior to heating.

There were multiple explosions, and a plume of smoke could be seen throughout the Comox Valley.  Apartment buildings near the gas station were evacuated due to the risk of further explosions and the thick smoke pouring out of the Esso, also home to the Garlic & Pepper Eatery.  “When I came out of my house to look, I see this great big fire.

U.S. oil exports hit a record high of 4.5 million barrels a day this year as competitive U.S. product prices and China’s reopening after the COVID-19 crisis fueled global oil demand.  The Sonangol Porto Amboim tanker, which carries light sweet oil, departed Corpus Christi, Texas on May 16 bound for Saldanha Bay on the west coast of South Africa, according to vessel tracking information provided by Refinitiv Eikon and energy data provider Kpler.  South Africa gets most of its oil from West and Central Africa as well as Saudi Arabia, according to Kpler data. But competitive US crude prices and changes in oil flows since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have opened up new markets. The last shipment of US oil was shipped to South Africa in May 2021, according to US Customs data.

There is currently no word on the date and time of the matchup.  The Hoyas are one of two former Big East opponents to appear on the schedule, with the Scarlet Knights also slated to head up to Newark for the annual rivalry game with Seton Hall. Rutgers has confirmed one other high-major opponent on their schedule this season, with the return leg of the home and home with Wake Forest slated to be played in North Carolina.  It’s a potentially intriguing matchup for Rutgers. While Georgetown has struggled in recent years - most notably finishing 6-25 without a single win in conference play last season - the arrival of former Providence head coach Ed Cooley has given the program new momentum this offseason.  Since Cooley arrived in DC, Georgetown has seen an infusion of new talent, with the program bringing in the 26th ranked transfer class in the nation. Among the additions are four star Texas point guard Rowan Brumbaugh, who originally was committed to Northwestern as a high school prospect. Also coming to Georgetown is four star combo guard Jayden Epps out of Illinois, as well as combo guard Ismael Massoud, who arrives as a grad transfer after an Elite Eight trip with Kansas State.  The Scarlet Knights are still looking to round out their non-conference schedule, with several slots still yet to be announced. Rutgers has not been tied with any multi-team neutral site tournaments so far this offseason, and are not currently linked with any. Rutgers has historically played several local mid-majors at home during the early part of the season, with the bulk of their high-major opportunities coming in Big Ten play.  The matchup marks a return to the Gavitt Games for Rutgers, who did not participate last season. In their previous Gavitt matchup in 2021, the Scarlet Knights narrowly fell 73-70 at DePaul. Rutgers’ only win in the series came in 2016, as Rutgers beat DePaul in what was Steve Pikiell’s first win over a high-major opponent.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vMjQ3c3BvcnRzLmNvbS9jb2xsZWdlL3J1dGdlcnMvQXJ0aWNsZS9FeHBsb3NpdmUtYXRobGV0ZS1Lb3ktQmVhc2xleS1oYXMtdG9wLWZvdXItYW5ub3VuY2VtZW50LWRhdGUtc2V0LTIxMDU1MTQ2NdIBfWh0dHBzOi8vMjQ3c3BvcnRzLmNvbS9jb2xsZWdlL3J1dGdlcnMvQXJ0aWNsZS9FeHBsb3NpdmUtYXRobGV0ZS1Lb3ktQmVhc2xleS1oYXMtdG9wLWZvdXItYW5ub3VuY2VtZW50LWRhdGUtc2V0LTIxMDU1MTQ2NS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The April 10 fire at South Fork Dairy Farm in Dimmitt, about 66 miles southwest of Amarillo, killed nearly 18,000 cows and left one person injured. A report from the state fire marshal’s office found there was “no intentional act to cause a failure” but did not determine the cause of the engine fire.  The findings, which were first reported by the Associated Press, noted the dairy farm had a second manure hauling truck on the property outside of the barn, and a dairy manager told investigators it had also previously burned. Investigators found burn marks near the engine compartment that were consistent with the truck fire inside the barn.  Investigators and the dairy manager waited until the next day to make entry into the facility because of the limited visibility at night when the fire started, the threat of the building collapsing and injured cattle wandering.  Investigators note in the report that the structure had only been in use for two and a half years and that the 17,500 cattle housed in the dairy were milked around the clock. Investigators also allowed dairy workers to move injured cattle out and reassured them it would not hinder the outcome of the investigation.  The Animal Welfare Institute, which tracks barn fires, said it was the deadliest barn fire involving cattle since 2013. Investigators with the Texas State Fire Marshal’s Office previously stated the fire began as an accident, and the explosion was the result of flammable liquids, including liquid fuel, hydraulic oil and other materials “expanding rapidly.” The investigation into the fire is now closed.  The Texas Tribune previously reported that the massive dairy operation was authorized by the state to more than double the number of cattle allowed on-site in 2019, from 11,500 up to 32,000. The state also authorized the facility to increase its manure production by more than 50% in the same permit with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.  Dimmitt, located in Castro County, has a population of 4,200 residents. The county is the second-highest milk-producing county in the state and has more than 59,361 cows.

This plaza is located at the intersection of Óscar Flores and Boulevard Zaragoza, a place where different security corporations went to answer the call.  The radio operators of the immediate response center of the 911 emergency service, determined that the event is a threat of a bomb since several citizens who contacted the emergency line reported it.  According to the SSPM report, a male contacted the emergency number “911” anonymously mentioning that firearm detonations were heard in the Plaza Gran Patio Zaragoza.  Agents of the corporation arrived at the site and determined the event positive, noting that inside the Gran Patio cinema complex, 3 homemade explosive artifacts were located. Therefore, the site was evacuated.  According to the same police report, it was determined that the events were specifically recorded in theater number 7 of the cinema complex that is located inside the shopping center.  At no time was the authority able to determine if a firearm was actually detonated on the site since no ballistic element was located on the site.  The agents of the State Investigation Agency, North Prosecutor’s Office, accessed the recordings of the internal and external cameras of the shopping center to determine what happened, noting that weeks ago a similar situation had arisen on site, where a cinema function had to be canceled and evacuated due to the presence of 3 explosive devices in the place.

In a trailer for the upcoming season, which will be released on May 25, Kourtney lashes out at her sister as she accuses the SKIMS founder of using her her wedding to Travis Barker as a ""business opportunity"".  Kourtney and Travis tied the knot last year in the beautiful coastal village of Portofino, Italy, with their wedding sponsored by Dolce & Gabbana.  Just months later however, Kim was unveiled as the face of the fashion brand's Spring/Summer 2023 ad campaign.  ""People think it's a misunderstanding, it's not. It's who she is to her core,"" Kourtney said in the trailer as she went on a scathing rant about Kim.  It's safe to say the new Hulu series will be full of drama, but it's not the first time the famous sisters have been caught up in an apparent feud.  Here, we take a look back at some of Kourtney and Kim's biggest rows.  Kim's diamond earring devastation  Image: E!) E!)  Kim was devastated back in 2011 when her expensive diamond earring was lost in the ocean, but Kourtney was far from sympathetic.  The famous family were enjoying a trip to Bora Bora, but disaster struck for Kim when she lost the $75,000 (£60,000) piece of jewellery and she was left in tears.  Kim was thrown into the water by her husband-at-the-time Kris Humphries and her earring came lose after landing in the ocean.  Image: E!) E!)  She screamed: ""My earring's gone! F**k, oh my God I'm gonna cry. My diamond earring,"" before adding: ""We're not going to find it in the ocean.""  While Kim managed to gain sympathy from her momager Kris Jenner, sister Kourtney was less than impressed.  Appearing from one of the family's huts to see what all of the commotion was about, she scolded: ""Kim, there's people that are dying.""  Cruel appearance jibe  Image: E!) E!)  Things got nasty during a 2018 fight between Kim and Kourtney, as the family tried to organise their annual Christmas cars photoshoot.  While Kim tried to schedule a date, Kourtney said she was unavailable and refused to adjust her schedule to accommodate for Kim's business meetings.  ""I'm leaving at 4pm and I don't care what anyone says,"" Kourtney insisted.  Kim explained to their mother: ""That was when my meeting was.""  As Kourtney suggested Kim should change her meeting to 7am, Kim became increasingly annoyed and shouted: ""Get the f**k out of here and go.  Image: E!) E!)  ""No one wants you in the f***ing shoot. I'm planning this, so we don't want you in the shoot.""  Kourtney hit back and said she didn't care about the shoot.  Eventually, Kim had enough and shouted: ""Maybe if you had a f**king business that you were passionate about then you would know what it takes to run a f**king business, but you don't. So don't even act like you know what I'm talking about.""  When Kourtney walked away, Kim declared: ""She's the least exciting to look at, so she can be out. She doesn't do s**t.""  Style thief  Image: E!) E!)  During a 2019 episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Kim accused Kourtney of stealing her style.  The Poosh founder was joined by sister Khloe Kardashian as she tried on outfits for her birthday party.  As Kourtney styled a sparkly pink minidress, Khloe suggested they call Kim for her opinion, but Kourtney said she didn't trust her sisters judgement.  While on the video call, Kim said: ""Well, if you don't care, why do you keep picking out all the same clothes?""  Image: E!) E!)  Kourtney hit back: ""I don't know what you're talking about. I've never dressed like you.""  Kim further lashed out at her sister for reaching out to Thierry Mugler, despite the SKIMS founder having a special relationship with the designer.  Kourtney later branded the argument ""ridiculous"".  ""Kim and I have completely different styles, so even if we wear the same designer, we wear it in a completely different way.  ""The store may send me clothes that are more Kim's style, and I send them back.""  Things get physical  Image: E!) E!)  Kim and Kourtney's most notorious fight came in 2020, when Kim accused Kourtney of not showing up enough for the family business.  Kim claimed their mother Kris was always ""crying and begging"" her and Khloe to show up to events because she knew the other family members had different priorities.  However, Kourtney took offence to the comments and insisted she does work hard.  ""You have this narrative in your mind,"" she slammed. ""I will literally f**k you up if you mention it again.""  Kourtney then angrily threw a bottle of water at Kim, prompting the mother-of-four to jump to her feet and start a physical fight.  Image: E!) E!)  Kourtney was left in tears after her sister punched her.  Khloe was forced to break the fight up, before Kim accused Kourtney of scratching her and proceeded to slap her sister.  Kim later spoke about the moment on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, saying: ""I don't ever normally resort to violence like that, but she scratched me so hard.  ""When I looked down at my arm and I saw she'd really scratched me and I felt it all on my back, I just went over and slapped her back. It's not my proudest moment.""

Several key advancements were highlighted in the latest weekly development report released Friday, May 19.  According to the report, in scaling efforts, the Hydra team achieved significant milestones with the release of the first mainnet-compatible Hydra node version. These advancements address critical issues that need resolution before integrating Hydra Head with real ADA, ensuring users’ smooth and secure experience.  Voltaire workshops also commenced, providing opportunities for collaboration and networking among local Cardano communities. Voltaire is a big upgrade for Cardano in the future. As per the Cardano website, the Voltaire era of Cardano “will provide the final pieces required for the Cardano network to become a self-sustaining system.”  Elsewhere, the team responsible for making decisions worked with the research and networking teams to improve the Ouroboros Genesis design. They improved how they select the starting point, how they choose candidates, and how they use important connections. These changes were made to make the whole system work better and be more stable.  Notably, the Daedalus team completed work on the proxy server, guaranteeing ADA conversion rates from the CoinGecko API are dependable. As per the report, this team is preparing to release an updated version of Daedalus that will smoothly switch to this new endpoint.  Advertisement  Meanwhile, amid the developments, Cardano continued to witness significant progress, with various teams actively working on numerous projects, all contributing to the platform’s overall advancement.  The latest report reveals some impressive numbers for Cardano. So far, 127 projects have been launched on the platform, creating over 8.28 million native tokens. Additionally, there have been 8,277 Plutus scripts executed, showcasing the versatility and functionality of Cardano.  Notably, Cardano is now home to a whopping 1,242 active projects in various development stages. These projects collectively process a remarkable 66.7 million transactions, highlighting the platform’s growing popularity and widespread use.  This substantial increase in activity demonstrates the growing interest and adoption of Cardano as a preferred blockchain platform. The Cardano team has also been championing more decentralization, as evidenced by an upcoming Stake Pool Operators (SPO) vote, enabling SPOs to vote on important decisions about the network’s future.  With these notable developments and ongoing initiatives, Cardano is set to offer a robust infrastructure and foster innovation in the decentralized ecosystem, which is bullish for the entire ecosystem amid price watchtower to $1.  Proponents of the network’s native token ADA could also enjoy massive returns on their assets soon as the network continues to attract more users.

Additionally, TMS Network (TMSN) has been designed to be scalable from day one, so the platform will not face the issues plaguing other DEXs on the market, such as high fees and delays.  In terms of the TMS Network (TMSN) token itself, holders will be able to earn passive income by collecting a share of the revenue generated by TMS Network (TMSN) based on the number of tokens they hold.  BNB (BNB)  Decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume on Binance's BNB (BNB) Chain has soared to its highest level in a year, as reported by DefiLlama. During the week starting on May 7, DEX volume on the BNB (BNB) Chain reached an impressive $5.11 billion, a milestone not seen on BNB (BNB) since early May 2022. This surge follows a temporary increase to just above $5 billion in the aftermath of the collapse of crypto exchange FTX in November.  The rise in popularity of DEXs on BNB (BNB) could be attributed to the US regulatory crackdowns on centralized exchanges. In fact, for the fourth consecutive month in April, Uniswap, a DEX that has integrated BNB (BNB), outperformed Coinbase in trading volume.  Several factors contribute to this surge in trading volume. Katie Talati, the head of research at Arca, explained that lower fees on the BNB (BNB) Chain might be enticing users to trade there. Furthermore, the popularity of Binance as a centralized exchange may explain why users migrate to the BNB (BNB) Chain after using Binance.  Tron (TRX)  Tron (TRX) has unveiled the winners of its highly anticipated fourth season of the 'HackaTron' competition. This season's champions will share a prize pool of $500,000, a Tron (TRX)-based stablecoin, and gain access to Tron (TRX) DAO Ventures and Huobi Ventures for potential capital funding opportunities.  The Tron (TRX) competition attracted over 625 participants across six tracks, including DeFi, Web3, NFT, GameFi, Builder, and Eco-Friendly categories. Ejaz Merchant, Developer Lead at Tron (TRX) DAO, expressed his gratitude to the exceptional projects, partners, and dedicated Tron (TRX) community members for making the event a resounding success.  Notable winners from the event include Elk Finance, which took first place in the Builder category with its ""Farming-as-a-Service"" project, and EcoMarket, which won the Eco-Friendly track.  Going forward, BNB (BNB) and Tron (TRX) face an extremely uphill battle against Ethereum (ETH) as layer-one blockchains for building decentralized applications. Meanwhile, the ongoing TMS Network (TMSN) token presale offers investors the ability to get into a completely new type of crypto exchange on the ground floor and get a share of the revenue that will be generated by the platform.

"explosion","2024-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T22:30:52","The Wisconsin Badgers football staff recently hosted a top 2024 recruit in hopes of landing an official visit in the near future.  Dominic Kirks, a 2024 four-star edge rusher from Ohio, has proven himself to be one of the top threats off the edge in the class. Most of the Wisconsin staff had first started recruiting Kirks when they were still members of the Bearcats staff. It was not until recently that the Badgers had rekindled their relationship with the recruit. After playing hosts a few days ago, Wisconsin now waits for the elusive official visit to be scheduled.  Wisconsin Badgers Football: Top 2024 Defensive Target Nearing Official Visit  The Badgers staff began recruiting Kirks over a year ago during his Sophomore year of high school. Defensive line coach Greg Scruggs, who was then serving as a Cincinnati Bearcats assistant, has been the primary contact for Kirks. Scruggs continued to recruit Kirks after switching programs and joining the Badgers alongside his head coach, Luke Fickell. Fickell was a former defensive lineman himself and has always put forth stellar lines whenever he is coaching a team.  In order to continue to build the talented defensive line the Badgers already have, adding more linemen in the 2024 recruiting class will be a necessity. Wisconsin already had to fill the hole that Keeanu Benton had left and now must prepare to lose another handful of players. If Wisconsin has the success they expect as well, then plenty of players will try their luck in the NFL Draft next season.  Wisconsin is coming on strong for On3 4-star EDGE Dominic Kirks. He will take his first visit on May 19. If things go well, the Badgers will receive an official visit. Kirks has three OVs locked in: https://t.co/QWGlRa2TYR (On3+) — ChadSimmons (@ChadSimmons_) May 15, 2023  Scruggs has continued to aggressively recruit Kirks, however, the recruit has yet to set his official visit. Kirks, the 16th ranked recruit in Ohio and the 47th ranked defensive lineman, has already set two official visits with Pittsburgh and Washington. This past weekend the Wisconsin Badgers football staff hosted Kirks for a routine visit and had the chance to speak with the recruit. Following his visit, Kirks expressed that the Badgers had moved up on his list to Chad Simmons of On3 Sports.  Can The Wisconsin Badgers Land The Exceptional Four-Star Edge Rusher Dominic Kirks?  Kirks is a big, powerful edge rusher at 6-foot-5-inches, 250-pounds. The defensive star is not afraid to run through the blockers nor will he shy away from contact. Kirks plays an aggressive style of football that matches what Scruggs and Fickell both love to see out of their offensive linemen. Along with this, he also has another year to grow and add more size, which will surely help him at the collegiate level as well.  The worry behind Kirks is that he can be too slow off the snap and struggles to utilize an array of rushing moves. Kirks still needs experience and time to develop his all-around defensive game, but it should not be an issue for the talented recruit. The Wisconsin Badgers have also been looking at Ernest Willor Jr and Benedict Umeh as options for the 2024 class. However, Kirks may be the best bet for the Badgers given the relationship their staff has with the recruit.  Before visiting Wisconsin for the first time, Kirks made a quick stop at Penn State to visit the Nittany Lions facility. Next, the recruit will travel to Pittsburgh before visiting Washington. It has been a busy few months for Kirks and his recruitment will only continue to heat up as he makes this next round of visits.  Wisconsin has not solidified an official visit with Kirks yet, but that should certainly be their next move.

"explosion","2023-09-10","Not Discerned","{""Parkland"", ""Florida"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T00:00:00","(TNS) - Events of the past year have convinced more Florida homeowners of the need to carry flood insurance.Flooding caused by hurricanes Ian and Nicole caught hundreds, if not thousands, of homeowners across the state by surprise, and without flood insurance.Similarly, many homeowners affected by last month’s historic rainfall in eastern Broward County had no flood insurance and learned tragically that damage caused by water rising from the ground was not covered by their normal homeowner insurance.It’s not just flood victims who are experiencing hard lessons about flood insurance.Just as homeowners are realizing the increased risks of going without flood coverage, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has released data showing that coverage costs are exploding for properties in coastal areas most vulnerable to flooding.The cost hikes stem from mandates by Congress to require rates charged by the National Flood Insurance Program, which is run by FEMA, to reflect the cost of flood risk to individual covered properties, and to pay down the program’s deficit, which was $20.5 million as of last November, according to FEMA.The result is a new risk pricing model called, which took effect on Oct. 1, 2021, for new NFIP policies and on April 1, 2022, for renewing policies. Rather than set rates solely based on a property’s elevation within a zone on a Flood Insurance Rate Map, the new approach considers more risk variables such as flood frequency, types of flooding, and distance to a water source, along with individual property characteristics like elevation and the cost to rebuild, FEMA’s website states.Improved modeling, however, is of little comfort to homeowners who will have to pay more for flood insurance at the same time costs of regular multiperil property insurance are skyrocketing.Recently, FEMA released a spreadsheet that compared average premiums currently and how high they’ll climb under the new pricing model.For example, homeowners in Boca Raton’s 33432 ZIP code can look forward to a whopping 229% flood insurance premium increase, from an average $950 per policy to $3,128.In Broward County, the 33305 ZIP code that includes Wilton Manors and Fort Lauderdale neighborhoods near the Middle River will pay 209% more, from $1,099 to $3,400.In the 33315 zip code, which includes Fort Lauderdale’s Edgewood neighborhood that was among the hardest-hit by last month’s flooding, average rates will increase by 64% — from $863 currently to $1,420.These numbers are averages. Within each ZIP code are less expensive homes with cheaper coverage costs and pricier homes that will cost even more to insure.Unsurprisingly, homes nearest the coast, particularly in low-lying areas, cost far more to insure than homes on higher ground in western suburban cities.For example, homeowners in Coral Springs’ 33071 ZIP code are looking at a total premium increase of just 17.6% — from $669 to $787.FEMA says the new pricing model will also drive down the cost of flood insurance for customers with low-risk characteristics. Yet, none of South Florida’s ZIP codes will see average rates decrease, FEMA’s data shows.Not everyone facing rate increases will have to pay the higher premiums immediately. While homeowners who previously did not carry NFIP flood insurance will have to pay the new higher prices if they want a new policy, price hikes for existing policyholders are capped at 18% a year for homesteaded properties and 25% annually for second homes or investment properties, until they reach the new rates.If the total increase is 18% or less, affected homeowners will pay it just once — presumably until FEMA raises rates again, whenever that happens.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvdnRlY2guY29tL2VtL3ByZXBhcmVkbmVzcy9mbG9vZC1pbnN1cmFuY2UtY29zdHMtdG8tZXhwbG9kZS1mb3ItY29hc3RhbC1mbG9yaWRpYW5z0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ292dGVjaC5jb20vZW0vcHJlcGFyZWRuZXNzL2Zsb29kLWluc3VyYW5jZS1jb3N0cy10by1leHBsb2RlLWZvci1jb2FzdGFsLWZsb3JpZGlhbnM_X2FtcD10cnVl?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"explosion","2023-05-24","Not Discerned","{""Bergamo"", ""Lombardy"", ""Italy""}","2023-05-21T18:06:02","Geraint Thomas (Ineos Grenadiers) is patient but ready for the final showdown at the Giro d'Italia  Geraint Thomas is happy to play a waiting game at the 2023 Giro d'Italia, convinced that the fight for the maglia rosa will finally explode in the final week, on the three mountain finishes to come and in the final time trial next Saturday.  The Welshman and his Ineos Grenadiers team are playing a waiting game; saving their team strength for when it really matters and can really make a difference.  The 'Bergamo Classic' stage was a day to stay vigilant but proved not to be the day of GC attacks and time gaps. Thomas made sure he was protected on the long final climb to Roncola Alta and then rode near the front on the late climb to Bergamo Alto, happy to ride defensively.  He and his Ineos team are running down the clock in a game of bluff and patience, hoping to score a late touchdown and so land a late knockout blow.  Thomas is convinced he can use his experience and endurance in the high mountains in the final week and then be in pink when it really matters: at the summit of Monte Lussari, after the final mountain time trial next Saturday.  ""This race is going to explode at one point, I hope I'm at the right end of it,"" Thomas said in Bergamo as he warmed down on the rollers in the shadow of the Ineos Grenadiers bus after stage 15.  ""It's a waiting game at the moment but with three mountain finishes in the final week, including the final TT, a hell of a lot can happen.""  Thomas came into the Giro d'Italia after an injury-hit early season and so with delayed, still improving form. So far he has avoided COVID-19, crash injuries and the almost daily chaos of the Corsa Rosa.  Primož Roglič (Jumbo-Visma) also came back after shoulder surgery in the winter but showed his form in March by winning Tirreno-Adriatico and the Volta a Catalunya.  He appears on form but also preferred not to attack on the final climb of the Bergamo stage and so Thomas was also happy to keep his powder dry for another day.  Both will enjoy a quiet resort day on Monday. Bruno Armirail (Groupama-FDJ) has the pink jersey and leads Thomas by 1:08, who in turn leads Primož Roglič by two seconds and João Almeida (UAE Team Emirates), by 22 seconds.  The overall classification is tight but Thomas is happy to keep his cards hidden in a psychological and physical waiting game.  ""I'm content to wait for now. Hopefully, we can do something,"" he claimed, explaining why. ""To be honest, I came into the Giro hoping to limit my losses in the first two weeks, hoping to have good, good legs at the end. To be in front of the main rivals is certainly a nice bonus.""  ""There's also team dynamics and how people are feeling. Yesterday I didn't want to burn all the team to keep the jersey. It's not just about me, we need the team to set me up, so we've all got to get into the last week as best as possible.""  Thomas was expecting the Slovenian to be more aggressive and like everyone is struggling to understand why.  ""I'm surprised by it but who knows why?"" Thomas asked.  ""Maybe he's learnt a lesson from the last time he did the Giro. He went at it quite early and died off. Maybe he's suffering a bit with the crashes. It's one to ask him.""  Ineos Grenadiers directeur sportif Matteo Tosatto has some ideas on why this year's GC battle has not come alive. He also has a good idea when the fireworks will finally go off.  ""Someone will have to attack sooner or later. I think the real GC battle will finally begin on Tuesday on Monte Bondone,"" he told Cyclingnews.  ""Everyone is waiting for a number of reasons. One, as we saw today, is that the leaders are scared of being isolated without any teammates on the key climbs. The weather is also a factor. Saturday it was pouring with rain and 5°C at the summit of the Passo del Sempione, today it was 25°C.""  ""Then, most importantly, everyone knows the final week is incredibly hard. We just have to wait a little bit longer to see the Giro d'Italia explode but I'm convinced it will be worth the wait.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN5Y2xpbmduZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL3Nvb25lci1vci1sYXRlci10aGUtZ2lyby13aWxsLWV4cGxvZGUtZ2VyYWludC10aG9tYXMtcGF0aWVudC1idXQtcmVhZHktZm9yLWZpbmFsLXNob3dkb3duL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"explosion","2023-05-14","Not Discerned","{""Peshawar"", ""NorthWestFrontier"", ""Pakistan""}","2023-05-21T16:10:39","Population explosion: A looming threat  THE world’s population was around one billion in 1850. By 1950, only a century later, it had surpassed the 2 billion mark. Just 50 years ago, the population was around 6.8 billion, and U. S Census Bureau, 2010 projected it to reach over 9 billion by 2050. For Pakistan, the figures are astonishing and disturbing. Back in 1950, Pakistan stood 14th in the world in terms of population growth. It took only 71 years for her to become the fifth most populous country in the world. The population of Pakistan is equivalent to 2.9 percent of the world’s population. Many hazardous results are associated with the massive growth of the population in Pakistan. First, because of the unchecked population growth, intercity migration has gained momentum in Pakistan. As Pakistan has uneven development patterns in urban areas, the burgeoning population compels people to migrate to urban areas that offer a superior lifestyle. The towering population invokes schism within societies. It also provides a breeding ground for slums. Such informal settlements become an epicenter of poverty and crime.  Moreover, the rising population is creating more burdens for our education sector. Pakistan has the world’s second-highest number of out-of-school children, with almost 22.8 million children aged 5- 6 years not attending school, according to a report by UNESCO. Besides it, Pakistan’s healthcare sector is also under immense pressure because of the sharp spike in population. The terrifying fact is that we are still battling polio when almost all the lands in the world have victoriously defeated this virus.  The poor health status of the population further piles up the burden on the national exchequer. Besides, the Human Development Index Report 2020 (HDI), ranks Pakistan 154th out of 189 countries. The large surplus labor pool of Pakistan has become an impediment to achieving a sustained growth rate because of its mostly compromised skill sets. Additionally, towering population growth is ballooning youth bulge. Population control is necessary to invest in education, health, and the industrial sector to spur sustainable growth by enhancing HDI.  Our fast-multiplying population is a serious threat to the agricultural sector. Owing to the increase in the demand for housing and industry, expanding population not only eats away agricultural land but also demands increased production of food. According to a Pakistan Bureau of Statistics report, 16% of the population is enduring moderate or severe food insecurity in Pakistan. The global hunger index has ranked Pakistan at 92nd position out of 116 nations. The theory of Malthusianism is relevant in this context. It states that population growth is exponential while the growth of the food supply or other resources is linear, which decreases living standards to the point of triggering a population die-off. In addition, overpopulation in Pakistan has amplified the ill effects of deforestation because of rapid industrialization and urbanization. According to World Wildlife Fund, only 5.7 percent of land in Pakistan is under forest cover and the country’s deforestation rate is the second highest in Asia, after Afghanistan. It also adds up greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere.  The intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) recognizes population as one factor in greenhouse gas emissions. Pakistan has some of the most polluted cities in the world; the concentration of the population in a few major cities is the reason. According to estimates from the WHO Global Health Observatory, about 200 fatalities per 100 000 inhabitants are because of environmental factors in the country. As the human footprint has reached farther and farther in quest of urbanization and industrialization, we are forcing wildlife species to squash up into ever smaller habitats, endangering their survival. Many biologists link the extinction of wildlife to the extinction of societies on Earth. It drives us to the point that the population growth of our country is inviting myriad challenges of varying intensity. Pakistan needs to implement robust reforms to save itself from succumbing to the pressure of the growing population. In this regard, we should educate our people regarding the advantages of having smaller families.  It is only through knowledge that people will recognise the severity of the matter to help the government in tackling this hazard. Women’s empowerment can be effective as it can significantly help restrain the population growth rate of the country. Enhancing the literacy level can help us achieve the desired goal of population control. We need to take lessons from the examples of Singapore and China: the countries that adopted two-child and one-child policies to overcome the devastating effects of population rise. The citizens of Pakistan need to understand that, to conclude destitution and disparity in the country, population regulation is the initial step. It is critical to have a meaningful debate on family planning. Our resources are depleting fast, our cities are becoming increasingly populated and polluted, and our environment is getting deteriorated day by day; there seems no relief in sight. Pakistan is already overwhelmed with multiple problems and the population growth is only intensifying the gravity of other difficulties, such as poverty, climate change, illiteracy, and social deterioration. Unless we make it a priority to deal with the emerging threat of a burgeoning population, we will fail to address the social and economic woes Pakistan is facing today.  ——The writer is contributing columnist, based in Rawalpindi.

Illang: The Wolf Brigade is expected to leave Netflix on Tuesday, May 23. This is unfortunate, not only because the sci-fi political action thriller is one of the best movies on Netflix, but because, as of this writing, there is no other way to purchase, rent, or stream the film in the United States.  Released in South Korea in 2018, Illang: The Wolf Brigade is I Saw the Devil director Kim Jee-woon’s adaptation of Hiroyuki Okiura and Mamoru Oshii’s 1999 anime film Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade, and it was quickly acquired by Netflix shortly after its premiere. Set in 2029, Illang follows Im Joong-kyung (Gang Dong-won), a member of a militarized police force tasked with quelling an insurgency caused by the impending reunification of North and South Korea following a disastrous economic depression.  Shaken after witnessing the death of a suicide bomber, Joong-kyung attempts to grow closer to the bomber’s sister (Han Hyo-joo) in order to discern whether or not she too is working for her sister’s compatriots, and to assuage his own conscience. Joon-kyung quickly finds himself at the heart of a maelstrom of byzantine political infighting, and is forced to choose whether or not to continue fighting as a member of the Wolf Brigade or run away with the woman in hopes of a better life.  Unlike other live-action adaptations of beloved anime like 2017’s Ghost in the Shell or 2009’s Dragonball Evolution, Illang: The Wolf Brigade is among the precious few adaptations that manage to meet the standard set by their predecessors. While not nearly as wistful and melancholic as Jin-Roh, Illang more than makes up for it with blisteringly intense firefights, pulse-pounding close-quarters action scenes, and exquisite practical effects and costume designs, especially in Brigade’s haunting gas mask-adorned armor suits. It’s less a film that supplants Okiura’s original as it is a companion piece to it, one that demonstrates the creative elasticity and enduring resonance of its source material.  Illang: The Wolf Brigade will join over 80 Netflix originals that have since departed the platform. Some are now available on other streaming services, or to rent or purchase digitally. Others are not available to watch anywhere legally in the United States.  Watch Illang: The Wolf Brigade on Netflix while you can, and while you’re at, go check out Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade, currently streaming on Crunchyroll and Tubi with ads.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb2x5Z29uLmNvbS8yMDIzLzUvMjEvMjM3MzAyOTcvbmV0ZmxpeC1zY2ktZmktbW92aWUtaWxsYW5nLXdvbGYtYnJpZ2FkZS10aHJpbGxlci13YXRjaC1sZWF2aW5nLXN0cmVhbWluZy1hbmltZS1hZGFwdGF0aW9u0gGSAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbHlnb24uY29tL3BsYXRmb3JtL2FtcC8yMDIzLzUvMjEvMjM3MzAyOTcvbmV0ZmxpeC1zY2ktZmktbW92aWUtaWxsYW5nLXdvbGYtYnJpZ2FkZS10aHJpbGxlci13YXRjaC1sZWF2aW5nLXN0cmVhbWluZy1hbmltZS1hZGFwdGF0aW9u?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

But cars erupting into fireballs when they crash or tumble down a mountainside is one of the most common and scientifically preposterous movie tropes.  The latest instalment of the Fast & Furious franchise features many exploding cars. LANDMARK MEDI /Alamy Stock Photo  With the release of Fast X, the latest in the Fast & Furious franchise, on May 19 2023, it’s time to debunk the myth of the exploding car.  Don't miss out on in-depth & unbiased stories from Northeast India. Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for free. Opt out or contact us anytime. See our Privacy Policy  Cars never explode under these circumstances and rarely catch fire. That’s unless you were unfortunate enough to be driving a Ford Pinto or Chevrolet Malibu in the 1970s. Both manufacturers cut corners in the production process and the result was poorly designed fuel tanks that were vulnerable to catching alight, often trapping the occupants inside.  Even when racing driver Romain Grosjean crashed at 140mph at the 2020 Bahrain Grand Prix, his vehicle caught fire but did not explode.  Petrol vapour is only explosive in air (which is 20% oxygen) and when under pressure. Liquid petrol isn’t explosive but the vapour can catch fire. Vapour can escape from the fuel tank when you unscrew the cap. But tanks have a system in which the pressure is relieved without venting the vapour. A full fuel tank is safer than you might think since there is no air inside it and so no oxygen.  In fact, liquid petrol can be difficult to ignite even when it comes into contact with a flame.  What an explosion needs  Explosions are normally caused by a reaction where one or more solids or liquids react and produce a corresponding amount of gas.  ADVERTISEMENT CONTINUE READING BELOW  A gas occupies much more space (800 times the volume of liquid or solid) than the equivalent amount of solid or liquid. The force generated by the rapidly expanding gas creates the explosion.  Shrapnel is added to explosive weapons of war, which is propelled by the expanding gas.  Petrol doesn’t detonate on its own, but explodes with oxygen when it is in its gas form, is hot enough (about 257℃) and in the presence of a flame or spark.  Imagine watching someone on a hot day filling their car. Often you see a shimmering effect near the tank filler. This is petrol vapour. The “no smoking” instruction on petrol stations signage and painted on oil tankers is about eliminating one of the three requirements for petrol to catch fire.  Petrol is a high energy compound. These compounds release a lot of energy when they react with other substances. When petrol comes into contact with oxygen and burns, it produces low energy compounds (water and CO₂). The difference in energy between those compounds is seen and heard as sound, heat and light and expansive force.  ADVERTISEMENT CONTINUE READING BELOW  In order for petrol to explode (rather than just burn) it needs to be under pressure, in the gas form, and have enough oxygen and a source of external energy such as a spark or flame to start the reaction.  Exploding cars  In a car engine, the explosion takes place in a cylinder. The piston compresses the air/petrol mixture to create the high-pressure conditions needed for an explosion. When a gas is compressed, it gets hot. That’s why the tip of a bicycle pump gets hot when you pump your tyres up. As the piston compresses the air/fuel mixture, the pressure and temperature rises.  The spark plug provides the small amount of energy required to make the reaction happen. This process happens several thousand times per minute in car engines.  Petrol and diesel can only explode when under pressure and mixed with air and in the case of petrol, have a small amount of energy added in the form of a spark or a flame. Engines pressurise the fuel/air mixture in the cylinder and so produce small, confined explosions which turn a crankshaft and drive the wheels.  Diesel is less flammable. Diesel engines use a higher boiling point fuel which spontaneously combusts under pressure, which is why diesel engines don’t need spark plugs. Diesel engines also cycle at a lower rate compared to petrol engines, which is why they last longer and offer greater fuel economy.  ADVERTISEMENT CONTINUE READING BELOW  When cars are involved in collisions, fuel lines are often torn and petrol leaks out onto a hot engine. Liquid petrol can catch fire in the presence of air. But it can’t explode because it’s not under pressure and is in the liquid phase rather than a vapour.  In a car crash, diesel or petrol may occasionally catch fire, but there is no mechanism for creating the high pressures required for them to explode, so they don’t.

"explosion","2017-05-18","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T13:00:44","The Grand Prismatic Spring at Yellowstone National Park sits in the Yellowstone Caldera, which formed 631,000 years ago (Image credit: Holger Leue/Getty Images)  The last super-eruption at Yellowstone volcano, which occurred 631,000 years ago, was not one huge explosion. Instead, new research suggests it was a series of eruptions or multiple vents spewing volcanic material in rapid succession.  According to the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) Yellowstone Volcano Observatory 2022 Annual Report , published May 4, fieldwork over the past year has provided new geological evidence that ""the formation of Yellowstone Caldera was much more complex than previously thought."" A caldera is a large crater that forms after the collapse of a volcano following an eruption.  Yellowstone is one of the world's biggest volcanic systems. It sits above one of Earth's ""hotspots"" — areas in the mantle where hot plumes rise and form volcanoes on the crust above. It has produced three caldera-forming eruptions in the past 3 million years: the Huckleberry Ridge Tuff eruption, 2.1 million years ago; the Mesa Falls eruption, 1.3 million years ago; and the Lava Creek eruption, 631,000 years ago.  Related: Milky Way Shines Over Yellowstone Waterfall in Awesome Photo  What are super-eruptions?  The Huckleberry Ridge Tuff and Lava Creek events are considered super-eruptions because they expelled over 240 cubic miles (1,000 cubic kilometers) of material. The latter was responsible for the formation of the Yellowstone caldera. Mesa Falls erupted 67 cubic m (280 cubic km) of material, so — while still about 10 times bigger than the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens — is not considered a super-eruption.  Related: Where are most of Earth's volcanoes?  Previous research has shown that the Lava Creek super-eruption was not out of the blue; deposits at the Sour Creek Dome region east of the national park suggest that the giant blast was preceded by at least one eruption. Ignimbrite (volcanic rock formed via the deposits of the hot mix of material ejected during an eruption) found at the site had completely cooled before the main, mapped Lava Creek eruption took place.  Researchers have found evidence that there were multiple explosive events during the last super-eruption at Yellowstone. (Image credit: Noppawat Tom Charoensinphon/Getty Images)  To better understand the timeline of the eruption, scientists spent 2022 remapping and collecting samples at Sour Creek Dome.  ""It had always been known that there were at least two geological units [a volume of rock distinct from those surrounding it] from the eruption, and it was thought that there was little to no time gap between them,"" Michael Poland , scientist-in-charge at the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory, told Live Science in an email. ""Now, we think there are more units. And we're just not sure what the time gap might have been, if any.""  So far, the team has found four previously unrecognized ignimbrite units at Sour Creek, suggesting at least four eruptive pulses. They also found two structures that appear to be eruptive vents, which may have been the sources of these rocks.  ""That could mean either several vents were active and/or there was time separation between the eruptions,"" Poland said. ""But we don't yet have the data we need to answer those questions yet.""  In 2020, scientists found the Huckleberry Ridge Tuff eruption — which ejected more than twice the amount of volcanic material as Lava Creek did — was also a phased event. Analysis of rocks at the site suggests there were three separate eruptions, with weeks to months between the first two, and years to decades between the second and third.  Yellowstone volcano is not expected to erupt anytime soon . However, the finding that the Lava Creek eruption may have followed a similar pattern to that of the Huckleberry Ridge Tuff eruption could give an idea of what to expect if and when Yellowstone does blow. ""These major caldera-forming eruptions might not be single events at Yellowstone, but instead have multiple phases,"" Poland said.  Researchers at the volcano now plan to carry out detailed examinations of the newly discovered units and the boundaries between them. This will allow them to paint a more detailed picture of what the Lava Creek eruption looked like — and maybe even what triggered it.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwYWNlLmNvbS95ZWxsb3dzdG9uZS12b2xjYW5vLXN1cGVyLWVydXB0aW9ucy1hcHBlYXItdG8taW52b2x2ZS1tdWx0aXBsZS1leHBsb3NpdmUtZXZlbnRz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"explosion","2023-07-25","19:15:00","{""Baltimore"", ""Maryland"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T22:26:33","Do you like offense? MLB certainly does, with its rule changes and its new commercials aimed at convincing us that even the Mets’ Daniel Vogelbach is a base-stealing threat now. Yay, runs!  If this is you, well, I’m sorry. Over nine innings, these two heavy-hitting teams scratched out just two runs apiece, and not in particularly beautiful fashion. Matt Chapman’s solo homer in the second was the only one the Jays scored off O’s starter Dean Kremer. Meanwhile, the Orioles pushed just across two runs against a tough Kevin Gausman—on a pair of RBI groundouts!—before Toronto tied it, 2-2, with a sac fly off a rusty Mychal Givens in the seventh inning. Nine innings of offensive blahness.  Emphasis, however, on the “nine innings” part. The O’s offense mostly snoozed in regular time, but suddenly in extras, it awoke like a mighty dragon.  We begin at the top of the tenth. Cedric Mullins, already with three hits on the day, came to the plate against Toronto’s Nate Pearson with Jorge Mateo at second as the Manfred Man. Pearson threw him a high fastball. Crack! Mullins laced it into right field and Mateo came home easily.  Alas, it wasn’t enough. By this point in the series, the Orioles ‘pen was depleted, with big guns Félix Bautista, Bryan Baker and Yennier Cano all unavailable, and Austin Voth went out for a second inning in a row. He got a big strikeout of Matt Chapman, but Whit Merrifield drove a single up the middle to tie the game, 3-3. That was it for Voth, Brandon Hyde determined. But who was left? Mike Baumann, that’s who! Baumann got an out before he’d even thrown a pitch: he fired to first base and picked off Merrifield, then retired the Jays’ catcher to keep the game going.  To the eleventh we went. With one out, Toronto’s Yimi García gave up a single to Adam Frazier, making it a two-hit day for the second baseman. Frazier’s single was hit hard enough that automatic runner Ryan McKenna couldn’t get past third. But Mac wouldn’t be stranded long. Austin Hays delivered his third hit of the game to score him, and the O’s had a 4-3 lead. My mind wandered, wondering if Big Mike was up to the task of a one-run, eleventh-inning save…  But I didn’t need to wonder very long. Gunnar Henderson kept the line moving with a single to load the bases, and Terrin Vavra, pinch-hitting for catcher James McCann, delivered the biggest hit of the night, a two-run double that, per MLB.com, instantly bumped the O’s win probability to 92.6%. To cap off the party—the team’s and his own—Cedric Mullins doubled deep to center, making this an 8-3 game.  Now with a five-run lead, Mike Baumann had no trouble mowing through the Jays. He rung up Cavan Biggio and retired Kevin Kiermaier and George Springer on flyouts. It was all smiles for Big Mike, and for this team, which just pulled off a three-game sweep against the Toronto Blue Jays.  Before that, yeah, there were nine innings of baseball. What we learned from these can be distilled into four conclusions.  One, Dean Kremer wasn’t gorgeous today (his hair, of course, the exception), but he was undeniably effective. “Dean Kremer can be a stubborn guy out there on the mound,” observed MASN’s Kevin Brown in the fifth inning, and I think that sums this one up. Kremer allowed traffic on the bases all day, but he allowed just one run, threw a season-high 105 pitches, and tied a career high with seven strikeouts. His fastball had tons of life, drawing seven whiffs, and so did his cutter. If this is Kremer on an “OK day,” this will be a very happy fanbase.  Two, defense was a difference maker today, and shortstop Joey Ortiz was a huge part of that. In the third inning, Brandon Belt had smoked a double off Kremer, but he ran into an out when Ortiz fielded a grounder and alertly fired to third.  The Blue Jays had their webgems, like in the fourth inning when Kiermaier hauled in a 395-foot Gunnar Henderson bomb to deep center and Bo Bichette made a diving grab to start a 6-4-3 double play. But the Orioles responded immediately, as Ortiz, Frazier and Mountcastle turned a 6-4-3 GIDP of their own to end a brewing threat.  Defense also saved the team’s bacon after Kremer left the sixth inning following a walk and a single and Cionel Pérez promptly loaded the bases with a four-pitch walk. I started to get sad, thinking about what was about to happen to Dean Kremer’s ERA, and then, wow: a Pérez sinker found the zone, Kiermaier hit it weakly to Ortiz, and like that, the Birds had their second GIDP and another lucky escape.  To cap it off, Ortiz also did Danny Coulombe a solid in the eighth inning after leadoff man Cavan Biggio walked, stole second easily … and then overslid the bag! Ortiz held the tag, and bam, Biggio was gone. The rest of the inning was easy.  The Orioles’ defense been mediocre thus far, but it’s waking up. And right now, between Ortiz and Jorge Mateo, there’s an excess of riches at shortstop.  Three, Mullins is on one massive hot streak. He was a one-man wrecking crew today, and it was only because the Orioles’ two-, three-, and four-hole went a collective 0-for-15 that he didn’t score enough runs to win this game for Baltimore even earlier. Mullins had five hits on the day, including two doubles and three RBI, and he now has a team-leading .858 OPS, which is not something I saw coming.  Fourth and finally, this series was closer than advertised, with scores of 6-2, 6-5 (in extras), and today’s 8-3, which was 2-2 in nine innings. You think you’ve seen the last of the Blue Jays? Think again.  But that doesn’t take away from the fact that the Orioles are doing it all right now. If they don’t have the offense firing, like today, the bullpen steps up big in the clutch. And it wasn’t the A-team relievers that did it, it was Pérez, Givens, Coulombe, Voth and Baumann.  A 31-16 Baltimore just swept a series on the road against the Toronto Blue Jays, a team they went 2-8 against in 2020, and 5-14 in 2021.

The Swifts took control of Sunday's clash at Ken Rosewall Arena with a 26-11 blitz in the second quarter then dominated after halftime to mark milestone games for dual championship winners Paige Hadley (150 games) and Sarah Klau (100 games).  The result means the Swifts will lock in a semi-final berth with one more win over the final four games of the regular season, while the 29-goal margin provides a valuable percentage boost as they draw level with league leaders Adelaide Thunderbirds on 30 competition points.  Hadley produced a masterful performance with 30 feeds, 19 goal assists and two intercepts as she became the sixth Swifts player to reach the 150-game mark.  ""I feel like playing 150 games for the Swifts, who I grew up watching the yellow dress, was so special and for the girls to put out of performance like that, I couldn't be prouder,"" an emotional Hadley told Fox Sports.  Hot shooting from two-point range by Helen Housby (9-of-12) and second-year goaler Sophie Fawns (5-of-6) kept the scoreboard ticking over for the Swifts on the way to winning every quarter.  ""We knew that (Collingwood) were always going to try and come back but it was really nice to be able to build every quarter today, that's what we've been trying to look for,"" Hadley said about her side's four-quarter effort.  Collingwood entered the match on a five-match losing skid and facing an uncertain future following the announcement that the team's participation in the national competition was under review.  The Magpies made a promising start by keeping pace with the home side throughout the opening quarter, holding a narrow lead nearing the end of the first quarter.  But Klau forced a late turnover to set up a Housby Super shot and allow the Swifts to grab a 17-15 buffer at the end of the term.  Swifts co-captain Maddy Proud left the court in the opening quarter following a head clash with former teammate Sophie Garbin.  She was able to return in the second period and helped trigger an offensive explosion as the home side outscored Collingwood 12-2 in the final five minutes of the half.  NSW's 43-26 halftime lead came off the back of disjointed play from the Magpies as the extra possession conceded through 12 general play turnovers began to take its toll.  Kelly Singleton provided some impetus for Collingwood's attack in the third quarter with four Super shots but the Swifts still outscored the visitors 20-16 to put the result beyond doubt.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vYWZyaWNhLmVzcG4uY29tL25ldGJhbGwvc3RvcnkvXy9pZC8zNzY4ODAwMy9uc3ctc3dpZnRzLWJ1aWxkLXN1cGVyLW5ldGJhbGwtd2lubmluZy1zdHJlYWvSAW5odHRwczovL2FmcmljYS5lc3BuLmNvbS9uZXRiYWxsL3N0b3J5L18vaWQvMzc2ODgwMDMvbnN3LXN3aWZ0cy1idWlsZC1zdXBlci1uZXRiYWxsLXdpbm5pbmctc3RyZWFrP3BsYXRmb3JtPWFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Hari Budha Magar, who lives in Canterbury, Kent, reached the summit of the world’s tallest mountain at 3pm on Friday, having started the climb on 17 April – exactly 13 years since he lost his legs after an IED explosion.  While waiting 18 days at the Everest base camp for the weather to clear, the veteran and his crew faced freezing conditions and saw two dead bodies being dragged down.  Speaking to the PA news agency from the Mount Everest base camp, he said: “All of my jackets were completely freezing. It was all frozen. Even our warm water, we put hot water in the Thermos, and that was also frozen and we were not able to drink.”  He continued: “When I came down we ran out of oxygen. The guys came up with oxygen … I was bumping down on my bum and we had 30, 40 minutes of oxygen, and we still had about two, three hours to get down.”  Gurkha veteran Hari Budha Magar in Kathmandu on 3 April 2023.

Throughout the challenge, he was supported by a team of Nepalese climbers, led by Krish Thapa, also a former Gurkha and SAS mountain troop leader. Budha Magar became the first double above-the-knee amputee to summit the world’s tallest mountain.  Hari Budha Magar’s mountaineering gear displayed in April 2023. Photograph: Narendra Shrestha/EPA  Budha Magar said he felt his life was “completely finished” when he lost his lower legs in Afghanistan, battling alcoholism and depression.  “I grew up in Nepal, up to age of 19, and I saw how the disabled people were treated in those remote villages,” he said. “Many people still think that disability is a sin of previous life and you are the burden of the earth. I believed this myself because that is what I saw. That is how I grew up.”  He continued: “It was a pretty hard time and at one point I was just drinking too much, to just control my pain and emotions and all the things, and I tried to kill myself a couple of times.”  He added that he first thought about climbing Everest when he was walking to school barefoot and planned to do so in 2018. However, double amputees and blind people were banned in an attempt to reduce the number of climbers dying on the peak.  The veteran helped campaign to have the ban removed so he could attempt to summit the peak.  Budha Magar left Nepal to serve as a corporal with the Ghurka regiment in the British army before his injury.  Once he is down from the mountain, he says he is looking forward to spending time with his family and wants to return to Afghanistan to the site when he lost his legs so he can say “thank you”.  He said: “Without [losing my legs], I wouldn’t be climbing Everest, so and it wouldn’t even count much. Whatever happens, it happens for good.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS93b3JsZC8yMDIzL21heS8yMS9leC1ndXJraGEtc29sZGllci13aXRoLW5vLWxlZ3MtcmVhY2hlcy1zdW1taXQtb2YtbW91bnQtZXZlcmVzdNIBbGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS93b3JsZC8yMDIzL21heS8yMS9leC1ndXJraGEtc29sZGllci13aXRoLW5vLWxlZ3MtcmVhY2hlcy1zdW1taXQtb2YtbW91bnQtZXZlcmVzdA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Setsuko Thurlow, who now lives in Canada, was about 1.8 kilometers from ground zero and was exposed to radiation from the explosion when she was 13.  For more than half a century, she has been calling for abolishing nuclear weapons around the world. She gave a speech at the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony when the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, or ICAN, was awarded the prize in 2017.  Thurlow said she felt the statement ""G7 Leaders' Hiroshima Vision on Nuclear Disarmament"" did not mention their feelings.  She said the people of Hiroshima had hoped that the leaders would understand the significance of the summit being held in the city, visit Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum, and see what the people in the city went through.  Thurlow said she was surprised that the statement did not include a single word about the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons that actually exists in the international community.  She said she was also disappointed that the statement only carried things that had been discussed in the past, despite the leaders having the opportunity to meet atoic bomb survivors, visit the museum and think.  Thurlow added that she does not feel the G7 summit in Hiroshima created momentum for the people and the government to work together toward abolishing nuclear weapons.  She stressed that she hopes the leaders will not let the G7 summit end as a celebration, but keep up the momentum toward abolishing nuclear weapons.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3My5uaGsub3IuanAvbmhrd29ybGQvZW4vbmV3cy8yMDIzMDUyMV8zMi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Deemmeris Debra'e Burns shows the spot on a rural road in Satartia, Miss., where he lost consciousness when a carbon dioxide pipeline ruptured, an experience he thinks is a warning for America. Julia Simon / NPR  THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor  On Feb. 22, 2020, a clear Saturday after weeks of rain, Deemmeris Debra’e Burns, his brother and cousin decided to go fishing. They were headed home in a red Cadillac when they heard a boom and saw a big white cloud shooting into the evening sky.  Burns' first thought was a pipeline explosion. He didn't know what was filling the air, but he called his mom, Thelma Brown, to warn her to get inside. He told her he was coming.  Brown gathered her young grandchild and great-grandchildren she was watching, took them into her back bedroom, and got under the quilt with them. And waited.  ""They didn't come,"" Brown says. ""Ten minutes. I knew they would've been here in five minutes, but they didn't come.""  Little did she know, her sons and nephew were just down the road in the Cadillac, unconscious, victims of a mass poisoning from a carbon dioxide pipeline rupture. As the carbon dioxide moved through the rural community, more than 200 people evacuated and at least 45 people were hospitalized. Cars stopped working, hobbling emergency response. People lay on the ground, shaking and unable to breathe. First responders didn't know what was going on. ""It looked like you were going through the zombie apocalypse,"" says Jack Willingham, emergency director for Yazoo County.  Now, three years after the CO2 poisoning from the pipeline break, some in Satartia see the incident as a warning at a critical moment for U.S. climate policy. The country is looking at a dramatic expansion of its carbon dioxide pipeline network, thanks in part to billions of dollars of incentives in last year's climate legislation. Last week, the Biden administration announced $251 million for a dozen climate projects that focus on CO2 transport and storage.  There are now about 5,300 miles of CO2 pipelines in the U.S., but in the next few decades, that number could grow to more than 65,000 miles, says Jesse Jenkins, professor of engineering at Princeton University who has researched scenarios to reduce U.S. emissions.  But the rupture in Satartia underscores growing concerns across communities that face the prospect of more CO2 pipelines being built to address climate change. Safety advocates and community residents worry about pipeline safety and gaps in federal regulation, says Bill Caram, executive director of the nonprofit Pipeline Safety Trust. ""We're looking at those pipelines being a lot closer to people and communities than they are right now,"" Caram says. ""We are not yet ready.""  Thelma Brown's sons and nephew were on their way to come get her from her Satartia home when they lost consciousness. Unsure where they were, she gathered her grandkid and great-grandkids — ages 9 years, 2 years, and 3 months — under the quilt in her bedroom, and waited. Julia Simon / NPR  Carbon dioxide hampers emergency response  The expected growth in CO2 pipelines is tied to a nationwide push for more carbon capture and storage. That's the idea of sucking up carbon dioxide generated by things like power plants, cement-makers and steel factories and storing it underground before it heats the planet. Fossil fuel companies such as ExxonMobil and Chevron and their congressional allies like Joe Manchin pushed for higher tax credits for carbon capture in last year's climate legislation.  Now the government is on the verge of pouring over $10 billion into this technology through a combination of grants and loans, with billions more available through tax credits, according to analysis from the Bipartisan Policy Center. Pipelines are needed, because when companies suck up carbon dioxide, they often can't store it where they capture it. They use pipelines to send it to underground locations with the right geology for storage, which can be states away. ""Do we want to capture carbon dioxide and store it? If you do, we're going to need pipelines,"" Jenkins says. ""One follows from the other.""  But people in the South and Midwest who face the prospect of new pipelines in their communities see what happened in Satartia as a potential warning. The rupture occurred at 7:06 p.m. and spewed CO2 for about four hours. The 911 center in Yazoo County, Miss., was flooded with emergency calls. The Climate Investigations Center obtained recordings of the 911 calls and shared them with NPR.  In one 911 call, a mother pleaded for help because her daughter couldn't breathe, her hacking audible in the background. Another 911 caller stranded on the highway described what was happening to her friend: ""She's laying on the ground and she's shaking. She's kind of drooling out of the mouth. I don't know if she's having a seizure or not. Can you send somebody quick!""  Humans always breathe some carbon dioxide, but too much causes a thirst for oxygen, disorientation and heart malfunction. Extreme exposures to carbon dioxide can lead to death by asphyxiation. The use of carbon dioxide to kill pigs in abattoirs is now under scrutiny over whether it complies with federal laws on humane slaughter.  Carbon dioxide in open air can disperse. But third-party air monitoring that night in Satartia showed that potent clouds of CO2 can sometimes hang in the air for hours.  It quickly became clear that the cloud of carbon dioxide was hampering the emergency response. Combustion engines need oxygen to work, and as the carbon dioxide displaced oxygen in the air, many cars stopped running.  ""I don't know what's going on,"" said the caller on the highway. ""My car stopped, it won't move, and we just got outta the car and started walking.""  Jerry Briggs, a fire coordinator from Warren County, was searching the area in a utility terrain vehicle when he and his team found a red Cadillac with what looked like three men passed out inside. At first Briggs wasn't sure if they were alive. When they broke open the car windows, they found Burns, his brother and cousin, all unconscious.  Because the UTV was so cramped, they considered taking the men to safety one by one, but Briggs' colleague worried that the men wouldn't make it if they left any of them behind in the car.  Jerry Briggs, fire coordinator for Warren County, thinks people need to understand the potential for CO2 pipeline ruptures. ""It happened. I mean, I am living proof to tell you it happened."" Julia Simon / NPR  Three years on, the community still suffers health impacts  Briggs' team helped get Burns, his brother and cousin to the hospital. The medical team at the hospital sent them home after a few hours. But the following day, struggling to breathe, Burns came back to the hospital. He, his brother and cousin ended up taking oxygen tanks around with them for several months.  They aren't the only ones in the community with ongoing respiratory issues, says Markus Stanley, chief of staff and medical director of the emergency department at Merit Health River Region, a hospital in nearby Vicksburg, Miss.  Stanley treats patients who were in the area the night of the pipeline rupture, including residents and first responders. ""I've had several patients say, 'My lung problems have gotten a lot worse since I was exposed to that,'"" Stanley says. His patients with asthma ""do show some increased frequency and severity of their asthmatic exacerbations.""  Carbon dioxide poisoning can also affect the brain, says Steven Vercammen, an emergency room physician in Belgium who has studied carbon dioxide intoxication. ""The brains are the most vulnerable for the decrease in oxygen,"" Vercammen says. ""If your brain [does] not have enough oxygen, it will start to die. Depending on which parts of the brain are affected, you will see different symptoms. Most often you see that there are effects on cognitive function.""  Burns says that after spending more than an hour unconscious in a car filled with CO2, he still has headaches, difficulty concentrating and muscle tremors. He gestures to his shaking hand. ""I'm an outside worker, you know what I'm saying?"" Burns says. ""No inside building job. Never had that. I've always did construction or lumber mill work and, you know, I can't do that now.""  Burns also saw a psychiatrist for the anxiety attacks he had after that night. ""They gave me some pills for it, but I'd rather not take those 'cause they had you sleeping most of the time,"" he says.  Markus Stanley, chief of staff and medical director of the emergency department at a hospital in nearby Vicksburg, Miss., says his patients who experienced the pipeline rupture have seen an increase in the frequency and severity of their asthma attacks and chronic lung issues. Julia Simon / NPR  Satartia opens up questions over pipeline regulatory gaps  Federal regulators who investigated found that the pipeline operator, Denbury Inc., violated several regulations that night, including in its emergency response. When the pipeline ruptured in Satartia, Denbury knew there was an issue almost immediately, according to the government's report.  In an earnings call a few days after the event, David Sheppard, Denbury's then-senior vice president for operations, said the company's CO2 operations center ""detected a pressure loss ... immediately triggering our emergency response protocol."" Sheppard also said on the call that ""no injuries to local residents, our employees, our contractors were reported in association with the leak.""  THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor  But emergency responders in Satartia say that after the pipeline rupture, Denbury didn't alert them. ""I never heard from 'em,"" county emergency director Willingham says. ""It just didn't happen. Nobody contacted us to let us know.""  Only after a local emergency responder called Denbury did the company confirm what had happened, according to the government report. That was at 7:48 p.m., more than 40 minutes after the rupture. ""We may have — could have — had a better response had we known what was going on,"" says Willingham.  Regulators also found that the company failed to recognize the risks that the weather and soil posed to the pipeline. Unlike the Mississippi Delta, which is famously flat — ""an area you can watch your dog run away for three days,"" Willingham says — nearby Satartia is hilly. Federal regulators determined that all the rain in the weeks and months beforehand caused the uneven ground to shift, and the pipeline to rupture.  Denbury recently ""agree[d] to the findings of violation"" — though it said it did ""not admit to any of the alleged violations or risks identified"" by the government — and paid the government a $2.8 million penalty. Burns, his brother, cousin and others in the community are suing the company. Denbury did not reply to NPR's request for comment about the lawsuit.  In an emailed statement to NPR, a Denbury spokesperson says they fully cooperated with regulators to investigate what happened and worked with local officials to address the impacts. ""Denbury is an industry leader in carbon dioxide transportation and we remain committed to continually improving pipeline safety,"" the statement said.  John Satterfield, the director of regulatory affairs for Summit Carbon Solutions, a company that's constructing CO2 pipelines across the Midwest, says the incident in Satartia speaks to problems with the pipeline operator, Denbury, and not problems regulating the wider industry.  ""It's not as if there's some huge gap in the regulatory schema,"" says Satterfield, whose company is building new CO2 pipelines across North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa and Minnesota. ""The regulations have been in place for years. There are pipelines everywhere. It's the safest mode of transporting large volumes of products across our country, and the pipelines that we're talking about building today are brand new, and they're based on the latest technology.""  Other pipeline industry executives point out that the accident rate of their network is low. But Briggs, the fireman who rescued the men from the Cadillac, says when people in the industry say pipelines are safe, he gets frustrated. He thinks people need to understand the risks of CO2 poisoning, and potential pipeline ruptures. ""It happened. I mean, I am living proof to tell you it happened,"" Briggs says. ""Maybe it hasn't happened before this event, but it did happen. People were hurt, people didn't know [the pipeline] was here. Something needs to change.""  Jack Willingham, emergency director for Yazoo County, says that the night of the pipeline rupture, his team didn't know what was going on: ""It looked like you were going through the zombie apocalypse."" Julia Simon / NPR  ""What we learned here is that we need a stronger standard""  CO2 can take different forms, like gas, liquid and dry ice. Jesse Arenivas is chief executive of EnLink, which is building a CO2 pipeline network in Louisiana to support customers such as ExxonMobil. He says for the first project, the company plans to transmit about 70% of the CO2 as a gas and transmit the rest as a liquid.  But while CO2 in its ""supercritical"" liquid state is regulated by the federal government, the gaseous state and other states aren't currently regulated at all. Caram of the Pipeline Safety Trust says if there's a disaster while the CO2 is a gas or other unregulated state, ""I worry about a good lawyer getting an operator out of any kind of liability.""  There are other potential regulatory gaps. CO2 itself is odorless. So is natural gas, but companies add an odorant to alert people to its presence. There is currently no such requirement for CO2. There's also a limited understanding of how CO2 can move through the air, says Caram. ""As we're building these pipelines, we don't have a good sense of who's going to be in that potential impact area in the case of a failure,"" Caram says.  Tristan Brown is the deputy administrator of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), the federal agency that regulates CO2 pipelines. He says in June 2022 his agency issued an advisory bulletin to make sure all pipeline operators looked out for geologic hazards, updating their guidance to include lessons from the Satartia pipeline rupture.  And he says the agency is making new rules around CO2 pipelines, including looking into regulating more phases of CO2, like the gaseous phase, and potentially requiring odorants. ""I think what we learned here is that we need a stronger standard and so that's what we're working towards,"" Tristan Brown says. He also notes that the agency is increasing the number of pipeline inspectors and engineers by 20%.  Still, Yazoo County emergency director Willingham worries that with tens of thousands of miles of new pipelines and lots of processes for self-reporting, the necessary enforcement might not happen. ""I think they're dependent on the operators to make sure that they're going by code,"" he says, ""and you can't police yourself.""  Some pipeline executives are learning from Satartia. Others haven't heard of it  NPR spoke with leadership at four companies building thousands of miles of new carbon dioxide pipelines across the United States. Most had heard of what happened in Satartia.  ""We take those learnings, and we study those cases and we implement safeguards so we don't repeat those incidents,"" says Arenivas of EnLink, who says they educate local communities about what will go through the pipe.  ""We are very well aware of what happened in Satartia,"" says Elizabeth Burns-Thompson, vice president of government and public affairs for Navigator CO2, which is building carbon dioxide pipelines across Iowa, Nebraska, Illinois, South Dakota and part of Minnesota. She says the company is holding meetings with first responders and communities even before breaking ground. And they're looking at new safety precautions, including contracting with a university research team about adding an odorant to their CO2. ""The odorant that we're looking at has a garlic aroma,"" she says.  Navigator and the company Summit tell NPR that in light of the updated regulatory advisory following Satartia, they are continuing to look at hazards from weather and soil along the entirety of their lines.  Mike Fernandez, a senior vice president at Enbridge, a pipeline company that is building carbon dioxide pipelines in Texas, said he had not heard about the Satartia incident. But he adds: ""What you have to do is you have to let science and innovation kind of lead the way and you need to understand what are the risks. At the same time, what you want to do is try to diminish those risks so that they become smaller factors.""  ""We are pushing envelopes. We're trying to innovate. We're trying to do something different in the name of saving the planet,"" Fernandez says. ""We all have to realize that there are pluses and minuses with every technology, and some are slightly riskier than others. And we just need to make sure if it is the right thing for us to do in order to reduce carbon dioxide then let's do it, but let's do it with caution.""  But U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., who serves on the House subcommittee covering pipeline safety, questions whether all these pipelines really will help save the planet. ""We should be concerned about this from a safety standard. We really have to be concerned about this from a climate perspective as well,"" he says.  ""This entire strategy is being represented as a climate solution, when most of the time it's really not. Most of the time it's really part of the climate problem.""  A sign for a carbon dioxide pipeline in Satartia, Miss. There are now about 5,300 miles of CO2 pipelines in the U.S., but in the next few decades, that number could grow to more than 65,000 miles. Julia Simon / NPR  A climate solution, or more of a climate problem?  Huffman notes that today most of the carbon dioxide transported in pipelines is used for something called ""enhanced oil recovery."" That's a process where oil companies inject CO2 into oil wells to boost the pressure and pump out more petroleum.  Currently over 70% of carbon capture projects involve ""enhanced oil recovery,"" says Bruce Robertson, energy finance analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a nonprofit think tank. The CO2 in the pipeline that ruptured in Satartia was headed to an oil field where it would have been used to extract more oil.  While extracting fossil fuels can help make carbon capture projects more profitable, it can ultimately result in more planet-heating emissions. To help meet climate goals, many future projects for carbon capture won't involve extracting oil and will simply store the CO2 deep underground. But there are still questions about carbon capture's viability as a climate solution, says Robertson. He and his colleagues analyzed some of the world's largest carbon capture projects and found most of them underperformed on emission reduction targets, and many were over budget.  ""Is this a good way to spend money to reduce emissions? The answer's no. The answer is definitely no,"" Robertson says.  Ultimately, Huffman worries that many CO2 pipelines and carbon capture projects will end up extending the life of fossil fuel operations. ""This CO2 pipeline scheme is their lifeline,"" he says.  Back in Satartia, Burns walks by the spot on the road where the Cadillac stalled and he lost consciousness. The site of the pipeline rupture is just through the trees, less than half a mile away.  These days, Burns avoids this patch of road. ""I always stay on the highway. I try my best not to even come down."" He now takes the long way to his mom's house. As for the communities across the country getting new carbon dioxide pipelines, Burns says he hopes they get more safety precautions. But mainly, he feels sorry for them.  Emergency director Willingham says in an ideal world, these CO2 pipelines wouldn't get built. If they are, he thinks everyone needs to learn about Satartia.

(AP Photo/Gregorio Borgia)  Pope Francis delivers the Regina Coeli noon prayer in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican, Sunday, May 21, 2023. (AP Photo/Gregorio Borgia)  CAIRO (AP) — Pope Francis on Sunday called on Sudan’s warring forces to lay down their arms, expressing dismay about the ongoing fighting and worsening humanitarian situation in the African country.  The pope’s call comes a day after the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces agreed to a seven-day cease-fire due to take effect Monday evening. There have been numerous shorter cease-fire deals since the conflict began on Apr. 15, and all have foundered.  “It’s sad that a month after the explosion of violence in Sudan, the situation continues to be grave,” he told the faithful who’d gathered in St. Peter’s Square for his weekly appearance.  For over a month, the Sudanese army, led by Gen. Abdel Fattah Burhan, and the RSF, commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, have been locked in a violent power struggle that has killed more than 800 civilians, the Sudan Doctor’s Union said.  “Please, let’s not get used to conflicts and violence, and let’s not get used to war, please,” Pope Francis said during his appeal.  According to a joint statement issued by the U.S. and Saudi Arabia — the brokers of Saturday’s deal — the upcoming truce hopes to facilitate the “delivery of emergency humanitarian assistance and restoration of essential services.” The cease-fire could be extended if both sides agree.  Unlike the previous cease-fires, the week-long truce will be backed up by a “U.S.-Saudi and international-supported cease-fire monitoring mechanism,” the statement said. Few further details about the function or role of the mechanism were provided.  Over the past month, law and order and basic services have broken down across much of the country. In Khartoum, several districts are without electricity and running water. Looting is widespread.  The U.N. and rights organizations have accused both sides of human rights abuses, calling out the army for bombing residential areas and hospitals, and condemning RSF troops for attacking civilians and turning residential homes into operational bases.  The violence has been most acute in the capital, Khartoum, and the western region of Darfur. Ongoing fighting that flared up Thursday between the army and the RSF in South Darfur’s regional capital of Nyala has killed at least 25 civilians, the Darfur Bar Association said, a legal group focusing on human rights.  Last weekend, more than 280 civilians were killed when RSF and other affiliated militias stormed the city of Geneina, also in the Darfur region, and clashed with armed residents, the Sudan Doctors Union said.  ___  Associated Press writer Frances D’Emilio contributed to this report from Rome.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3BvcGUtc3VkYW4tYnVyaGFuLWhlbWVkdGktd2FyLXZhdGljYW4tN2RhZTA5ZTQ3YjJmOWU4M2NmYmE1MzQ2MjY4Njk1MzbSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"explosion","2023-05-21","Not Discerned","{""Manchester"", ""NewHampshire"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T19:36:00","MANCHESTER, England (AP) — With an explosion of blue-and-white ticker tape, Manchester City's Premier League title celebrations erupted.  That's three league titles in a row, five out of six and who knows how many more for a team that keeps on reaching new heights?  “They’ve set a benchmark that has pulled them apart,” Chelsea manager Frank Lampard said after his team was beaten 1-0 by the newly crowned champions on Sunday. “I think they’re outstanding ... that’s why they are on for a possible treble.”  The first leg of that three-pronged trophy pursuit is complete, with the finals of the FA Cup and Champions League still to come.  The concern for Manchester United and Inter Milan in those respective finals is that this City team only appears to be getting stronger as the season nears a spectacular climax for Pep Guardiola.  Political Cartoons View All 994 Images  “To be considered one of the greatest teams we have to win Europe, win the Champions League,” the City manager said.  Victory against Chelsea extended City's unbeaten run to 24 games in all competitions. And even with Erling Haaland, Kevin De Bruyne and a host of star players named on the bench against Chelsea, a 12th straight win in the league was secured.  It was a run that proved too much for an Arsenal team that had led the way for much of the season, but buckled on the final stretch.  Nobody at City appears to be tiring of that winning feeling.  Certainly not Guardiola, who has now won 11 league titles in 14 seasons of management, spanning Barcelona, Bayern Munich and City.  Not the players either, who answered their coach's challenge earlier in the season by proving they had not lost their edge and sang “We Are The Champions” in the locker room.  And not the supporters, who flooded the field after the final whistle at Etihad Stadium, letting off canisters of blue smoke and celebrating joyously as a period of unprecedented success for their beloved team goes on.  While this latest title — a seventh under the ownership of Abu Dhabi's ruling family — was duly relished, the overriding feeling within the stadium was about what comes next.  One banner, carried onto the field by fans, read: “The treble is on” and Kyle Walker spoke of the team's determination to ""create history.”  In that sense, it would feel like an underwhelming end to the campaign if City failed to add to the league title.  That is a natural consequence of Guardiola's dominance and why the pressure on him grows to finally conquer Europe with this team.  For City's English rivals, however, the title remains a dream and Arsenal — like Liverpool in recent years — has learned the hard way just how painful it can be to go head-to-head with Guardiola.  In the end, Mikel Arteta's side fell away all too easily, winning just two of its last eight games. But for much of the season, it felt like Arsenal would hold on for a first title in 19 years.  It might not get a better chance to beat City than this year when Guardiola's players struggled for consistency before going on a relentless march from February.  Even then, Arsenal led the table by eight points as recently as April 7, but still couldn't hold off City's charge.  “Arsenal brought us to our limits, otherwise (we) would not win these 12 games in a row,” Guardiola said. “We didn't give up and they felt that we were there.”  It is possible to imagine City getting stronger next season, with 52-goal Haaland more settled in the team and the league.  New signings are also likely to come in during the off-season and Guardiola's new three-man defensive system may also be more refined after changing his formation during this campaign.  That is for the future. On Sunday it was all about City's latest party, but Guardiola hopes the end of season celebrations have only just begun.  LEEDS NEARS RELEGATION  The Sam Allardyce experiment looks destined to fail after Leeds’ 3-1 loss at West Ham on Sunday pushed it to the brink of relegation.  Leeds needs to win against Tottenham on the last day of the season and hope that other results go its way to avoid the drop.  Rodrigo opened the scoring at London Stadium, but goals from Declan Rice, Jarrod Bowen and Manuel Lanzini consigned Leeds to a latest defeat.  Allardyce was tasked with the job of ensuring survival at the start of May, but has only picked up one point in his three games in charge.  “It was always going to be a difficult task,” the 68-year-old former England coach said. “Lots of people said I’m mad for taking it. I’m not mad. I just love football and Leeds United was too big a job to turn down for me, however short it was.”  BRIGHTON INTO EUROPE  Roberto de Zerbi might be one of the most in-demand coaches around this summer — but he says he has his sights set on leading Brighton into Europe next season.  “The club, the players, me, my staff, and the fans, they have to organize their passports to travel in Europe next year because we have to grow together,” he said after a 3-1 win against relegated Southampton on Sunday.  Few could have predicted such a successful season for Brighton after manager Graham Potter left for Chelsea in September.  But De Zerbi has taken the club to new levels after leading it to Europe for the first time in its history.  That was secured against Southampton, with Evan Ferguson scoring twice in the first half to set up the win.  Mohamed Elyounoussi pulled one back after the break, but Pascal Gross’ goal sealed a 3-1 victory.  Brighton can't now finish lower than seventh — in the Europa Conference League spot — though a sixth-place finish and a Europa League berth are all but mathematically guaranteed.  ___  James Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson  ___  More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c25ld3MuY29tL25ld3Mvc3BvcnRzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjMtMDUtMjEvbWFuLWNpdHktY2VsZWJyYXRlcy1wcmVtaWVyLWxlYWd1ZS10aXRsZS1hdC1ob21lLXdpdGgtZmFucy1ub3ctdGFyZ2V0cy10cmVibGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Read more  NEW YORK — The pieces were all there Sunday afternoon: the bright lights, the cheering crowd, the flashy pregame hype video that ended with Sabrina Ionescu saying, “I hope you enjoy the show.”  There was even a pregame speech from the floor by new star Breanna Stewart where the Syracuse, N.Y., native told the crowd: “It’s nice to be home.”  But the Big Apple’s basketball fans didn’t come just to see the sizzle. They came to see big-time hoops, and they got what they wanted.  Stewart erupted for 16 first-quarter points on 6-of-7 shooting, including 4-of-5 from three-point range, and tallied 45 points and 12 rebounds to lead the Liberty to a 90-73 rout of the Indiana Fever.  Advertisement  » READ MORE: The New York Liberty are a superteam — and the Big Apple’s best chance for a long-awaited first WNBA title  It was a long way from the Liberty being on the other end of a rout two days before in Washington. Granted, the veteran-laden Mystics are a far better team than the young Fever, which have No. 1 draft pick Aliyah Boston but much work still to do.  Still, there was no doubt that this was the style of success that justifies the super-team hype around the Liberty.  Before tipoff, New York point guard Courtney Vandersloot — one of three big offseason acquisitions, along with Stewart and Jonquel Jones — admitted that not only did the team have little time together in training camp, but the players may have made things too complicated.  “We’re trying to be so unselfish that we’re passing up really good shots,” Vandersloot said. “That comes along with the learning curve. But we’ve all been playing this game for so long, and we have a good sense of what’s a good shot, and we trust in one another that we’re going to take the right shot.”  » READ MORE: Natasha Cloud’s Mystics show Breanna Stewart’s Liberty they’ve still got work to do  Liberty coach Sandy Brondello described Friday’s game as “a team that had chemistry and a team that didn’t.”  This time, things went better. New York recorded 28 assists to 17 turnovers, after an 18-to-20 ratio in D.C.  But when the biggest star of all seizes the show, there’s no doubt where the spotlight goes.  Stewart’s sixth made three of the day — and 15th made field goal overall — gave her the Liberty’s single-game scoring record before the third quarter was over. A cascade of “M-V-P!” chants erupted from a crowd of 8,575 that pretty well filled the Barclays Center’s lower bowl.  » READ MORE: The WNBA’s Philly connections: Kahleah Copper, Natasha Cloud, and some you may not know  She ended up joining Maya Moore as the only players in WNBA history to hit 45-plus points, 10-plus rebounds and six-plus made threes in a game.  “I didn’t know I broke, really, any record,” Stewart said of her highest career scoring total as a pro or collegian at UConn. “I looked up at the scoreboard one time, and then I saw I had 37, and I was like — ‘I don’t even know what just happened.’”  Another cascade came down after the game, and drowned out much of a postgame interview that was broadcast on the big screen.  One key line came through loud and clear. In Stewart’s first Liberty home game after spending her first seven years as a pro in Seattle, she said: “It feels like I made the right decision.”  “I want people to be here, and I want people to come back.” Stewart said in her postgame news conference a few minutes later. “And I want more — I want more of everything. Yeah, it sounds selfish, but as a women’s basketball player, as a female athlete, we need to continue to get recognized for more, and in a lot of different ways: in media coverage, in fans, and eyes, and viewership.”  » READ MORE: Dawn Staley and Vice President Kamala Harris welcomed Brittney Griner back to the WNBA  The highlights didn’t just come from Stewart, though obviously a lot of them did. Jones had 14 points, Vandersloot had 11 points and eight assists, and Ionescu had nine points, eight assists, eight rebounds, two steals, and a block.  Ionescu’s assist total was especially significant after she had just two against Washington, while shooting 7-for-20 from the field.  “We understand that we can score from all positions, everywhere on the floor,” she said. “When Stewie’s shooting like that, it opens up the floor for everyone … This is a standard now. We know that we’re capable of playing like this, and we’re holding ourselves to the standard every single night.”  If the Liberty can get balanced performances with all their stars, they might just finally win the team’s long-awaited first title.  “If I had 45 and we lost, then it would [stink],” Stewart said. “Moments like this, you just have to enjoy it.”  Then again …  “We have Breanna Stewart and they don’t, I suppose,” Brondello said. “That’s [what] it comes down to. … When Stewie started making all these shots, that’s greatness.”  » READ MORE: Philly has all the ingredients to find a quality WNBA owner.

The explosion of harmonies, effortlessly orchestrated by two of the most recognized voices in Jamaican music, made the track an emotional, soul-touching adventure that only sought its climax after Alaine and Dexta had given it their all, weaving melodies that descended into a joyful whisper between the duet, who had been celebrating a well-deserved love.  See It Yah, which literally translates from Jamaican Patois to mean ‘See It Here’ or more accurately ‘Here It Is,’ features Alaine and Dexta Daps in a rather convincing portrayal as ecstatically grateful lovers. From the forehead-to-forehead contact to the face-caressing, Alaine and Dexta stop just shy of sealing the Quan Nelson-directed video with a kiss.  They, however, play their chemistry beautifully, and instead of the palpable tension and playfulness that persisted throughout the video feeling like a tease, they instead created a near-perfect image of a love beyond content with itself. If the video had somehow fallen short of achieving that, it would have, at the very least, been the acting audition of the year for the two crooners, who left it up only to the real world to confirm that they weren’t, in fact, a real couple. In the video, they were lovers, and if ever there was a secret ingredient to the song’s overwhelming charm, that was it.  With an explosive and easy-to-catch chorus, coupled with runs that may very well inspire a few social media covers, Alaine and Dexta Daps may have stumbled upon a formula worth flexing at some point again in the future.  The song is a delight, and is a brilliant showcase in the magic that abounds when talent, passion and chemistry collide.  See It Yah, produced by Ajusdivybz Music, premiered yesterday, May 19.

"explosion","2023-05-20","Not Discerned","{""Sacramento"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T13:37:58","May 20, 2023 - SACRAMENTO, CA — The California State Assembly has advanced legislation to enhance transparency for private judges on a strong bipartisan vote. Authored by Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel (D - Woodland Hills), Chair of the Assembly Privacy & Consumer Protection Committee, Assembly Bill (AB) 924 would establish safeguards to help protect California consumers when legal claims are adjudicated by private mediators or judges.  The role of private judges has come under increased scrutiny following media reports detailing how renowned consumer attorney Tom Girardi had likely stolen millions of dollars from his clients, including children orphaned by a plane crash, victims of a pipeline explosion, and cancer patients. Notably, these reports included questions about the role of private judges and dispute resolution neutrals in enabling the Girardi scandal—oftentimes, Girardi relied on private judges that he selected and paid for, and who appeared to disregard the management of client funds or look the other way at blatant ethical concerns.  It is not clear that all of the private judges knew Girardi was using them as a shield to fend off scrutiny, but there is evidence that some were aware of misconduct allegations and assisted him anyway. For instance, in one settlement case, the private judge assigned to oversee the settlement helped Girardi circumvent certain safeguards to allow Girardi to continue embezzling money from his clients. In another settlement case, the private judge helped Girardi fight subpoenas related to Girardi’s alleged misconduct of withholding settlement money from cancer survivors.  Despite the wide power of private judges in the legal system, no government entity specifically monitors or polices their conduct. Tom Girardi’s reliance on them raises questions about whether there are enough safeguards in this highly confidential and largely unregulated industry to protect the public from predatory attorneys. AB 924 would help to address this concerning issue by mandating that a private judge or dispute resolution neutral who receives a written complaint alleging a violation of conduct to report that information and other related details, including the attorneys involved, to the State Bar of California.  AB 924 is a critical step in addressing the issues highlighted by the Girardi scandal, and the lack of significant oversight of dispute resolution neutrals. The bill is expected to be heard in the State Senate in the coming weeks.

Each week we'll pose conversation-starting questions online at Coloradoan.com/opinion, moderate online discussion and then recap the best discussion points.  With high school graduation week upon Fort Collins, it's a good time to look at the state of education in Colorado. Over the past decade, one unmistakable trend is the continued explosion of charter school enrollment in the state, which is second out of all states, trailing Arizona.  No longer niche:Colorado charter schools educate nearly 15% of state's public school students  Nearly 15% of public school students in Colorado attend a charter school, which are approved by either a local public school district or the Colorado Charter School Institute. They receive the same base per-pupil funding as district schools but have more flexibility in their curriculum and operations.  One trend driving charter enrollment, which in the Fort Collins and Loveland area is likely to crest 10,000 students next fall, is the ongoing conversation around parents' rights in directing their children's education, accompanied by a rise of parent-led charter school applications for ""classical"" education models.  For some background, the Associated Press has an explainer on long-running parents rights issues in education.  The debate over parents rights has often been driven by ideology on various hot-button topics, from sex education over the decades to districts' COVID-19 response, and most recently about the role of public schools in addressing students' gender identity.  Now, not all educational choices are decided by political ideology, but area charters like Liberty Common, Ascent Classical Academy and the nascent American Legacy Academy in Windsor have commonly been referenced as alternatives for children of conservative parents who disagree with the stance of local public school districts on topics of gender identity, COVID masking, arming school personnel and more.  Parents all face difficult decisions in the upbringing of their children, especially as children grow older and more influenced by their peers, media, teachers, coaches and other external factors. It's certainly reasonable, with all these uncontrollable variables, to seek control where it can be found.  But this debate on parents' rights raises an important question: Does Colorado's public education system run the risk of becoming splintered along ideological lines? What would the implications of having essentially ""liberal"" and ""conservative"" schools be on the state's mandate to provide a free and equal education to all K-12 students? And what would the implications, positive or negative, be on children's ability to learn from and engage with Colorado's increasingly diverse population? What can parents and educational leaders do to strike a balance that respects both the diversity of our children and their families, along with parents' foundational role in the upbringing of their children?

With Vin Diesel reprising his role as Dom Toretto and joined by actors such as Jason Statham, John Cena, Brie Larson, Tyrese Gibson, Michelle Rodriguez and Charlize Theron, the film looks to be the beginning of the end.  As Vin Diesel has stated on several occasions, the tenth installment will be the first of a trilogy that will bring the franchise to an end. And the key to this grand finale will be the big villain they face: Jason Momoa. The Aquaman actor plays Dante, the son of a drug dealer with whom the “family” ended in Fast & Furious 5, so he returns in search of a revenge that he wants to carry out piece by piece and link by link.  Fast X comes to revalidate a formula that has been working since the fourth installment of the saga.

"explosion","2019-05-24","19:00:00","{""Miami"", ""Florida"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T17:05:17","The Miami Heat found themselves trailing by 11 points at the start of the second quarter in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference finals against the Boston Celtics. With Boston’s double-big lineup, the Heat struggled to create consistent looks, and Bam Adebayo and Jimmy Butler were denied shots at the rim.  Heat coach Erik Spoelstra decided to turn Caleb Martin loose, dialling up plays to exploit Robert Williams III’s drop coverage. Two minutes into the second quarter, Martin set a screen for Kyle Lowry, dragging Jayson Tatum and Williams with him. Lowry passed the ball to Martin, who took advantage of the space given to him and finished through contact, scoring the first of his 12 points in the quarter.  The Celtics had used a similar strategy in last year’s conference finals, with Williams helping off PJ Tucker. The Heat’s offense struggled as Tucker was limited, and Williams made it difficult for Adebayo to get to the rim. Martin, on the other hand, is a much more dynamic offensive player, capable of attacking that space with hard dribbles and athletic finishes at the basket. In the second quarter, he even made two 3-pointers from the right wing.  When the Celtics went small in the second half, starting guard Derrick White in place of Williams, it was Celtics coach Joe Mazulla admitting they cannot treat Martin, nor Miami’s offense, that way. Miami’s offense opened up, and Martin finished with 25 points. Butler, with 27 points, and Adebayo, with 22, took over down the stretch.  Martin’s development has been crucial for the Heat’s offense, which Spoelstra knew he needed to diversify after being bogged down in last year’s conference finals. Martin’s performance has helped set the tone for the series and give the Heat a 2-0 lead. If the Celtics stick with their small-ball lineup in Game 3, it will be interesting to see if Spoelstra swaps Martin in for Kevin Love.

Why you can trust Windows Central Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test .  I’ve been a fan of Razer’s Nommo speakers since they were released in 2018. Coming in at different price points, including Nomma Chroma and Pro, Razer’s Nommo Pros set the bar for powerhouse delivery, especially with its subwoofer, which is the size of an office trashcan.  I feared Razer gave up on the line, especially with its new — and highly innovative — Leviathan V2 sound bar. Luckily, that’s not the case, as the company just announced the Nommo V2 X ($149.99), Nommo V2 ($299.99), and the top tier Nommo V2 Pro ($449.99). Additionally, the company has a new accessory dubbed the Razer Wireless Control Pod ($49.99), which is like Surface Dial but with a multimedia do-it-all focus.  I’ve spent the last week with the Razer Nommo V2 Pro, and here are my thoughts. Why trust me? Well, up until last week, all I have used are the Nommo Pros, so I’m in an excellent position to talk about what’s new, what’s good, and maybe what doesn’t work.  Disclaimer: This review was made possible by a review unit provided by Razer. The company did not see the contents of the review before publishing.  Razer Nommo V2 lineup Razer has a range of Nommo V2 speakers that just launched. The V2 Pro is the top-of-the-line, featuring wireless connectivity, a subwoofer, and Chroma lighting. You can save some money by going for the wired Nommo V2 or a pair of Nommo V2 X speakers. No matter which one you choose, you'll get THX Spatial Audio and cross-platform compatibility.

(Image credit: Daniel Rubino)  While not announced, Best Buy and Amazon often carry Razer products, and as inventory moves through the channels later in June and July, the Nommo V2 Pro and other versions could appear in those stores.  The new $50 Wireless Control Pod won’t be available worldwide until August 2023. However, the Nommo V2 Pro comes with the Wireless Control Pod in the box, so those who purchase the premium, top-tier version gets it on day one starting in June.

The two drivers on the V2 Pro and V2 have an Aluminum Phase Plug, a more professional-grade mechanical interface, while the V2 X does not feature this technology. The V2 Pro and V2 have Razer Chroma backlighting, whereas the V2 X does not. Finally, the V2 Pro comes with the Razer Wireless Control Pod, while the other two models omit it (though it can be purchased later for $50).  Razer Nommo V2 Pro: Setup and software  The front and rear of the Razer Nommo V2 Pro main speakers including rear RGB projection. (Image credit: Daniel Rubino)  The Nommo V2 Pro is easy to set up especially compared to the original version, which had a wired subwoofer and wired control pod in addition to optical out, resulting in an efficient but clumsy system.  The two drivers connect via a braided cord, while the right speaker has a power input and USB Type-C (to Type A) output, which is connected to the PC or laptop. In addition, the V2 Pro has a wireless subwoofer, which means fewer cables and more freedom to place the subwoofer in different locations. That said, the subwoofer still needs power and has its mini plug for AC.  Likewise, as the name implies, the Razer Wireless Control Pod has no cords.  Everything connected without effort — I didn’t have to do anything with the wireless subwoofer and the Wireless Control Pod to get Windows 11 (and Razer Synapse) to see it and the speaker drivers. That was pretty cool.  Don't forget to update your speaker's firmware? OK (Image credit: Future)  Running Razer Synapse V3, Razer’s proprietary software, I was surprised to see that the speakers and subwoofer both had firmware updates waiting, which you don’t typically see. I don’t know what the updates did, but it only took about 5 minutes before I could play and configure the Nommo V2 Pro.  Razer gives enough settings to give users control over the Nommo V2 Pro without overwhelming them. By default, the system is set to stereo (instead of THX), and the EQ is flat.  Honestly, I wasn’t thrilled with the out-of-box audio experience as things did not sound as good as my original Nommo Pro. However, turning on THX and customizing the EQ to the classic ‘rock curve’ (high bass, lower mids, boosted treble) or going to the Movie preset dramatically changed the sound profile. Razer does include presets like Game, Movie, and Music, but I find tinkering with the 10-band equalizer is the best option as it significantly alters how the speakers sound.  10-band EQ and presets for Nommo V2 Pro. (Image credit: Future)  In addition to the EQ, Razer provides a separate slider for the subwoofer with seven levels to either increase or decrease the amount of the bass supplied. Oddly enough, however, this slider recently disappeared from Synapse, so I’m not sure what happened there. Users can also switch to Bluetooth for other connected devices, including your phone as another input source.  One exciting addition to the Nomma V2 line is ‘Game Profiles,’ where THX and game makers created custom sound schemes for various games. For now, only Cyberpunk 2077 is included with THX Environmental Mode. Razer says more are on the way, including Genshin Impact, Grand Theft Auto V (Steam), Hogwarts Legacy, Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, and Monster Hunter Rise, although you are free to create your own custom profile for either games or apps and even add artwork, which is a nice touch. Razer provides Bright Memory: Infinite, Command & Conquer Remastered Collection, Diablo IV, and Doom as examples. Users can set those games to Default, Game, Movie, Music, Custom, or Follow existing Audio EQ.  Razer Synapse V3 settings for the Nommo V2 Pro. (Image credit: Future)  The Nommo V2 and V2 Pro (but not V2 X) include Chroma RGB rear projection lighting, which is a clever addition. This means the lighting projects out the back of the speaker, presumably against your wall. The lighting can be set up using Razer’s Chroma Studio, where you can even set them to ‘ambient mode,’ which reflects the color scheme of your display at the moment. Of course, you can also use Razer’s various presets or customize the lights yourself.  My Nommo V1 Pro & Hue Bloom setup vs. new Nommo V2 Pro without Bloom. (Image credit: Daniel Rubino)  What I like about rear-projection Chroma RGB is that I previously used Hue Bloom lamps to do the same thing on my desk. It’s like Razer read my mind. Now, I can remove those lights for a cleaner setup or keep them (but move them) to provide even more colorful lighting for my desk and office. The brightness and spread of the Hue Bloom are analogous to the Nommo V2 Pros, so Razer didn’t cut any corners here.  The new Razer Wireless Control Pod comes with the Nommo V2 Pro or can be bought separately for $50. (Image credit: Daniel Rubino)  The Wireless Control Pod acts as a giant volume knob. You can also use it to power the speakers on or off, toggle input source, e.g., Bluetooth, mute (press down), play/stop, or be customized with Razer Synapse and set it to anything the user wants, like changing your mouse DPI. During my testing period, however, I could not configure the Wireless Control Pod as it did not show up in Razer Synapse, perhaps due to my early access.  Finally, Razer offers a ‘power saving’ function whereby the speakers enter a standby mode after 15, 30, or 45 minutes of non-use. While a nice inclusion, I found it more reliable to keep the speakers on except when the PC is turned off. Razer offers an option to turn off the RGB lighting when the display is not on, but I have not found this reliable in my testing.  Razer Nommo V2 Pro: Versus original Nommo and Leviathan V2 Pro  Smaller: Razer Nommo V2 Pro (L) vs. Nommo V1 Pro (right). (Image credit: Daniel Rubino)  Compared to the original Nommo Pro, the new V2s bring many small but welcomed additions. Here are a few that I’ve compiled from my usage:  Speaker housing and footprint are smaller than V1  The subwoofer is smaller than V1 (or rather, square and not cylindrical; also, lighter)  V1 RGB was just some tiny base lights that didn’t do much  THX spatial surround sound  THX Gaming Profiles  Wireless down-firing subwoofer and Wireless Control Pod  There are also other minor changes, like how the connection to the PC runs to the speaker driver (right) instead of the subwoofer, which means you need a shorter cable that can be closer to the PC.  The new Wireless Pod is significant because, quite frankly, I never used the wired one from Nommo Pro as it was connected to the subwoofer and often just fell on the floor. This new version is much more convenient and way more customizable.  Small but mighty. (Image credit: Daniel Rubino)  Regarding audio quality and sound … well, it’s fantastic. The subwoofer packs a punch that can shake your room and make something you feel. The THX works well in that even though the speakers are flanking you on the left and right, it creates a center-channel-like experience where dialogue sounds like it is coming at you, but music/effects are “to the sides.” This ability is due to the simulated 7.1 THX software experience from a 2.1 hardware setup.  Razer's excellent down-firing wireless subwoofer will rumble. (Image credit: Daniel Rubino)  I’m not sure why you would ever use just stereo, which is why it being the default setting is odd.  What about the Leviathan V2 Pro? We gave that system a very high rating, but it’s essential to know that Razer sees them for different audiences, and the Nommo V2 Pros are likely to be even more powerful overall. According to Razer, the Nommo V2 Pro is geared more toward the solo gamer who also wants a more traditional cinema and multimedia setup. While it lacks the ground-breaking beam-forming surround sound of the Leviathan V2 Pro, the Nommo V2 Pro fits easier on most desks as you don’t need to place the speaker below your monitor, which could be a problem for some setups with large displays that are 32-inches or larger.  Rear inputs on the right Nommo V2 Pro driver. (Image credit: Daniel Rubino)  While I love the Levithan V2 Pro for my setup, currently, with a 32-inch Dell 6K monitor, the Nommo V2 Pro works better. If I had to place a sound bar below this display, it’d jack it up much higher than I’d prefer. However, with the Nommo’s movable speakers, I can put them anywhere and adjust them on the fly.  Razer Nommo V2 Pro: Competition  Razer’s $400 Leviathan V2 Pro is damn awesome (if you like soundbars). (Image credit: Daniel Rubino | Windows Central)  There’s not a lot of competition in this space if you’re sticking to mainstream gaming speakers, especially ones with RGB.  The Razer Nommo Pro (V1) are still available, but Amazon has them for $550. While these are excellent speakers (more on that below), I could not recommend dropping $100 more for them when you get fewer features. Now, if they drop to $400 or lower, I would still consider them a good buy. While they lack THX and better RGB, the sound is still fantastic, which is what really matters.  You could also downgrade slightly to the Razer Nommo V2 ($300) with a wired subwoofer and no control pod or the Razer Nommo V2 X ($150), which are just the satellite speakers/drivers with no Chroma RGB, subwoofer, or control pod.  Razer’s $400 Leviathan V2 Pro is also a good alternative that I’m sure Razer wouldn’t mind if you chose instead. It’s also $50 cheaper. The sound from that device (with a similar subwoofer) will be close to the Nommo V2 Pro, plus you get literal head tracking that helps shape the soundscape to you in real time.  The Logitech 980-000467 Z906 5.1 Surround Sound system ($488) is slightly more expensive, and you don’t get RGB or wireless components, but you get a ""true"" 5.1 system instead of a 2.1, pretending to be 7.1. But, of course, positioning five speakers on your PC desk could be a challenge for space, not to mention a mess of wires unless you plan on mounting.  The Bose Companion 2 Series III Multimedia Speakers for PC are much cheaper at $183, but you only get two speakers. These won’t be as powerful or as loud as the Nommo V2 Pro as these are “basic” speakers, but they are made by Bose, which delivers some of my favorite default sound profiles.  Razer Nommo V2 Pro: Should you buy?  Razer Nommo V2 Pro is certainly clean and minimalist. (Image credit: Daniel Rubino)  You should buy this if …  You want a high-end 2.1 speaker system for your PC.  You have desk space for two speakers.  You want even more RGB for your PC battle station.  You already bought into the Razer ecosystem.  You should not buy this if …  You already have Razer Nommo V1 Pro.  You prefer a soundbar setup.  You don’t have $450 to drop just for audio.  Here’s the bottom line: If you’re coming from some cheap, knockoff computer speakers, the Nommo V2 series is a great place to start for replacements and easy to recommend.  As to which of the series to get, Nommo V2 X ($150), Nommo V2 ($300), or Nommo V2 Pro ($450), it clearly depends on what you feel comfortable spending. Ideally, most people go for the $450 Pro, as you get all the frills, including a wireless subwoofer and that control pod. If you do, you won’t be disappointed.  However, like most things in life, the middle choice (Razer Nommo V2 at $300) is likely the best for most people. You still get the same features, RGB, excellent drivers, and a powerful subwoofer, but you’re saving $150 over the Pro line. While the control pod is well built and highly functional, if you already have a keyboard like the excellent Razer Blackwidow V4 Pro (what I use), you get a smaller version of the dial and a volume/media scroll bar that’s even closer to your fingertips, making the control pod a bit redundant.  Top of the new Razer Wireless Control Pod to adjust volume, power, and more. (Image credit: Daniel Rubino)  Is the Nommo V2 Pro worth the upgrade over the original Nommo Pro? I’m not convinced they are. Dropping $450 for some improved audio, lighting, a smaller footprint, and a more wireless experience is a lot considering I didn’t have any complaints about the Nommo Pro V1 sound profile. Those are still fantastic, and I wouldn’t toss them in the garbage for these. Don’t get me wrong, if money is no object, the Nommo V2 Pro is great, but Razer kind of nailed version 1.0 with only some minor complaints if the sound is your only concern.  Besides the higher-than-average price, are there any downsides? The only one I can think of is Razer Synapse V3, which while crucial for the Nommo V2 Pro experience, is becoming a chonk at 1.3GB of files, and I occasionally do have some issues with it (like the disappearing subwoofer slider).  Speaking of price, it's important to note that the Nomma V2 Pro is $50 cheaper than the original Nomma Pro ($499) when it launched in 2018. While that doesn't undo the sting of $450 speakers, it's nice Razer did bring the price down a bit while delivering more (and better) features.  Razer does sound well, especially since it purchased THX a few years ago (the companies operated independently, however). The fun engineering of the Razer team with the technical and audio prowess of THX shines in these speakers. The Chroma RGB, (mostly) wireless setup, and new control pod are just icing on the cake. It's a safe bet I'll stick with the Razer Nommo V2 Pro for the next 5 years.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpbmRvd3NjZW50cmFsLmNvbS9nYW1pbmcvcGMtZ2FtaW5nL3JhemVyLW5vbW1vLXYyLXByby1yZXZpZXfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

After Waco: The Aftermath, Showtime brings us Ghosts of Beirut, another show based on heavily researched true stories that focus on the decades-long conflict in Lebanon regarding the Israeli occupation of Palestine. Uncountable were suffered by either side as one man, Imad Mughniyeh, orchestrated brutal terror attacks, pulling strings from the shadows while rising up the ranks in Hezbollah. Here’s what happens in Ghosts of Beirut Episode 1.  Spoilers Ahead  The Iranians In Turkey  In 2007, a group of men wearing US Army gear drove into a civilian administration center in Karbala and took away two US liaison officers. The attackers also managed to injure two US army men, and by the time CIA officer Lena reached the location where the attackers’ cars had been abandoned, the hostages had been killed and left inside the vehicles. She calls a number and confirms that the person behind this attack was Imad Mughniyeh and that she’s 100% sure about it as the title card rolls.  In a Turkish safehouse, Lena is asked to question the Iranian deputy general Ali-Reza Asgari about the Lebanese attackers, but Asgari refuses to cooperate and instead goes personal with Lena. Lena is adamant that the man knows where Imad, aka Radwan, is because he was the one who recruited the man who’d go on to be the second-in-command for Hezbollah. Lena goes on the offensive and threatens to throw the warmongering Asgari right back into Iran, where he’d crawled out of after stealing millions of dollars. The deputy general begins his tale of how he met Imad and how he was recruited.  Who Is Imad Mughniyeh?  In 1982, in Beirut, Lebanon, a young Asgari and his associate Mohtashmi-Pur watched as garage worker Imad shooed away some corrupt soldiers forcing an old fruit seller to pay bribes, and approached him. Asgari was a member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, while his partner, Mohtashmi, was the Iranian ambassador to Syria. After introducing them to his brother-in-law Mustafa and his brother Haidar, Imad learned from the two men that they had a camp in Baalbek and that Imad was needed there. He’d be joined by several of the oppressed Muslims terrorized by the Israeli government’s autocracy while occupying Lebanon, and Imad’s burning hatred against the Israelis doesn’t go unnoticed by the two recruiters. Imad later takes his wife Saada to a garage, where he shows her a massive collection of various kinds of guns and ammo, but she’s scared.  The American Peacekeeper  Elsewhere, CIA operative Robert Ames, who’d tried brokering peace in war-torn countries, tried the same for the Israelis and Arabian nations because of the brutalities of the ongoing tension. Ames had it on good authority that an old police station in Baalbek Valley had been purchased and would be used as a camp—the same camp where Asgari had invited Imad. In Beirut, Ames meets a PLO official and suggests the possibility of Israel withdrawing from Lebanon at the insistence of President Reagan.  A Massacre  Imad takes Mustafa and Haidar to the Baalbek camp, where he trains young Muslim men to shoot at enemies using rifles and quickly rises towards the ranks till he’s a commander, whom the young people look up to. They’ve got a singular goal: to free Lebanon of foreign presence. For the time being, it’s the Israelis, but it won’t take long for the enemies to be the American peacekeepers. Bachir Gemayel is elected president in Lebanon, but within a few weeks, he is assassinated, which sends shockwaves through the country. The Gemayel loyalists brutally massacre 2,000 Palestinian refugees in western Beirut, throwing a wrench in the USA’s peace accords. Imad and Saada visit a woman who lost her children at the hands of Gemayel’s militants, and Imad contemplates vengeance as Saada holds the wailing mother.  Suicide Bombers  From the get-go, Imad was determined to use terror to free the country, no matter the means necessary. He suggested the plan of suicide bombers who’d drive cars loaded with bombs into the Israeli army encampments and detonate them, killing the Zionists, but suicide is considered a sin in Islam, his brothers argued. Imad, however, rationalized this terror act by saying it’d be martyrdom, and whoever sacrificed their lives by killing Israelis would be granted paradise. Imad drove to a faraway town to the house of a man named Ahmad, who’d lost his family to Israelis and only had his younger brother Ali. Imad promised the best education and a bright future for Ali, and Ahmad would become a hero in Lebanon if he sacrificed his life.  A few days later, Ahmad drove a vehicle rigged with explosives into the Israeli military headquarters in Tyre, Lebanon, and exploded the car, resulting in the deaths of at least 28 people. While the Israelis insisted that it was caused by a gas leak, one Israeli officer, Meir Dagan, believed otherwise. He contacted Ames and drove him to Ahmad’s town, where the walls were covered with the “martyr’s” posters. The Israelis maintained the “gas leak” because they didn’t want Ahmad to be made into a hero across Lebanon, but Dagan warned Ames that the Israelis had been targeted now and the Americans wouldn’t be far behind because these people are fanatics and their fires are being stoked by Khomeini. Ames warns his bosses about Islamic Jihad and returns home for family time.  What Happened To The US Embassy In Lebanon?  However, while playing basketball with his kids, Ames is dragged back to Beirut because the Peace Corps has been greenlit. Inside the US Embassy in Lebanon, Ames learns that the investigations by the US officers have returned no results. The US officials don’t want to agree that it might be Jihad at all, while Ames questions why Khomeini didn’t start his actions against the invaders right in Lebanon. Just at that moment, Imad’s car passes by the US Embassy and signals a truck waiting in an alleyway—it’s the same truck that Imad had supervised, loading a heavy number of explosives inside. It’s lunchtime, and Ames stays back in the office as the other officials start leaving for lunch. Gunfire and commotion can be heard outside. Ames opens his mouth to let out a scream as an explosion blackens the screen. Imad’s car drives by, and the camera pans into his cold, merciless eyes—the eyes of a man who’d just orchestrated mass murder.  Robert Ames died that day inside the US Embassy because of the truck bomb. The truck had been instructed to drive straight in and hit the walls of the building before hitting the button that set off the explosion. Not only Ames but all the CIA operatives and other important officers who were looking into the peace treaty were killed in the explosion, and the tragic irony of this was that they were discussing how Lebanon could be freed from the Israeli occupation. This started a series of deaths that’d go on for several years more until justice would be brought down on Imad Mughniyeh, aka Radwan.  Review  From the very first episode, Ghosts of Beirut aims for a somber approach that can perfectly represent the condition of the Israel-Palestine crisis. Using live TV footage from 1982 as well as interviews with the people who were present during those times of unrest, the showrunners showcase the severity of the situation Lebanon was undergoing back then. The slow building of tension that leads Imad to resort to extremist violence against the ones he considers illegal occupants of his land shows the exact transformation from words to action. By the time he orchestrates the explosion of the US Embassy, he’s no longer a man who values the lives of others; now he’s just recklessly killing. Fantastic camera work, a background score that resonates with the situation, and gritty acting make Ghosts of Beirut a must-watch if you wish for a deeper look into the Israel-Palestine crisis.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vZnVnaXRpdmVzLmNvbS9naG9zdHMtb2YtYmVpcnV0LXNlYXNvbjEtZXBpc29kZTEtcmVjYXAtcmV2aWV3LTIwMjMtc2hvd3RpbWUtc2VyaWVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Russian aggression against Ukraine and the ban on the use of the nuclear weapons are among the key items on the summit’s agenda. When I visited Hiroshima last month the war in Ukraine and the nuclear issues were also at the top of my personal list of concerns. At the site of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial, also known as the Atomic Dome, a visitor can hardly avoid being taken aback or evenshocked by the contrast between the stark skeleton of a magnificent building destroyed by the nuclear explosion of 1945 and the beauty of its surroundings. When I visited the site, the lawn was resplendent with the colours of spring – green leaves on the bushes and blossoming red, pink, and white roses. Beyond the park is a prosperous modern city bursting with life.  A Japanese television reporter who accompanied me to the dome spoke about visiting American students who reflected on the horror of the atomic blast but noted that at least the bomb had exploded in the middle of the park, with few people around. The sad irony is that there was no park on that spot in Hiroshima when the bomb was dropped on 6 August,1945. The Industrial Exhibition Hall – the future Atomic Dome – stood approximately 160 meters away from the epicenter of the explosion. More than 140,000 people were killed by the blast and radiation.  As I listened to the story, my thoughts went back to Chernobyl, the site of another nuclear disaster that I had visited a few years earlier. The comparison could not have been more striking. At Chernobyl nature also revived, but the people did not return. The nearby city of Prypiat is still a ghost town decades after the explosion and will probably remain in that condition for generations to come. While the immediate destructive impact of nuclear bombs and the high levels of radiation they release are extremely damaging in the short run, nuclear accidents and their low doses of radiation turn out to have more lasting effects.  Most popular Julie Burchill The sad truth about Phillip Schofield  Hiroshima and Chernobyl came together in my mind because, after Russia’s all-out invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Chernobyl became the world’s most recognised symbol not only of nuclear accidents but also of the weaponisation of nuclear energy in wartime. The Russo-Ukrainian War managed to do something that World War II could not, turning atoms for peace into atoms for war. An attacker can now use nuclear power not only to produce destruction on the scale of Hiroshima and Nagasaki but also to make the sites of nuclear explosions uninhabitable for decades if not centuries, as happened at Chernobyl.  On 24 February, 2022, the first day of the Russo-Ukrainian War, Russian forces captured the Chernobyl nuclear site, took the personnel of the plant hostage, and forced the same shift to work around the clock with no relief for twenty-five long days. They did not allow Ukrainian repair crews to come to the area and restore the power lines supplying the plant with electricity required to keep the nuclear facilities safe. The exhaustion of the plant’s staff and the lack of power to operate the cooling ponds containing spent nuclear fuel might very well have caused another nuclear accident at Chernobyl.  The Ukrainian armed forces drove the Russian invaders out of the Chernobyl nuclear zone in late March 2022, but Russian contingents besieged another Ukrainian nuclear power plant – Europe’s largest – southwest of Zaporizhia. There the Russians employed heavy equipment and missiles during a struggle for the plant in March 2022. The administrative building suffered the greatest damage, but a training facility much closer to one of the station’s six reactors also caught fire.  Around the time I was visiting Hiroshima, Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), issued his 154th statement on the condition of nuclear power plants in Ukraine. Its text was particularly alarming. Grossi reported that on visiting the plant three weeks earlier, he had seen military preparations taking place nearby. And during the previous week, IAEA personnel whom the Russians allowed to remain at the station had heard shelling on a daily basis. That was especially dangerous, as the station relied on a single power line to supply the electricity required to cool its reactors. If it had been damaged, emergency generators would not have managed to provide backup electricity indefinitely, and meltdowns of the kind that took place at the Fukushima nuclear power plant might have followed.  Grossi’s earlier attempts to implement the IAEA Board of Governors’ resolution demanding that Russian forces leave the plant had produced no results. Russia declared that the nuclear power plant was its property and entrusted its operation to Rosatom, the Russian nuclear monopoly. Grossi and the international community then relied on Rosatom’s good will to gain access to the station and implement IAEA recommendations on avoiding disaster. With a Ukrainian counteroffensive expected in the region next month, it is anyone’s guess what may happen to the station and its lone power line.  The best things in life are free (for a month.

SUBSCRIBE  As I returned from the Hiroshima Atomic Dome to my hotel, I thought that the only way to save the world from future disasters like those at Hiroshima and Chernobyl is to make the capture of nuclear power plants – there are more than 440 in the world today – as much a taboo as the use of nuclear weapons.  Governments are unlikely to initiate such measures of their own accord: they would require strong public pressure, which proved effective in bringing about a treaty to ban atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons in the 1960s. The Ban the Bomb movement of the sixties made that landmark treaty possible and helped to secure numerous treaties on the non-proliferation and control of nuclear weapons. It is high time to start a new movement calling for an international treaty banning the weaponisation of nuclear sites.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwZWN0YXRvci5jby51ay9hcnRpY2xlL3RoZXJlcy1vbmUtd2F5LXRvLWF2b2lkLXJlcGVhdGluZy10aGUtaG9ycm9ycy1vZi1oaXJvc2hpbWEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"explosion","2009-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Knoxville"", ""Tennessee"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T03:27:16","DETROIT -- More than 33 million people in the United States are driving vehicles that contain a potentially deadly threat: Airbag inflators that in rare cases can explode in a collision and spew shrapnel.  Few of them know it.  And because of a dispute between federal safety regulators and an airbag parts manufacturer, they aren't likely to find out anytime soon.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is demanding that the manufacturer, ARC Automotive of Knoxville, Tennessee, recall 67 million inflators that could explode with such force as to blow apart a metal canister and expel shrapnel. But ARC is refusing to do so, setting up a possible court fight with the agency.  NHTSA argues that the recall is justified because two people have been killed in the United States and Canada and at least seven others have been injured by ARC's inflators. The explosions, which first occurred in 2009, have continued as recently as this year.  NHTSA tentatively concluded, after an investigation that has lasted for eight years, that the inflators are defective. The agency's documents show that the inflators date from at least the 2002 model year to January 2018, when ARC installed equipment on its manufacturing lines that could detect potential safety problems.  One of those who died was Marlene Beaudoin, a 40-year-old mother of 10 from Michigan's Upper Peninsula who was struck by metal fragments when her 2015 Chevrolet Traverse SUV was involved in a minor crash in 2021. She and four of her sons had been on their way to get ice cream. The sons were not hurt.  ARC maintains that no safety defect exists, that NHTSA's demand is based on a hypothesis rather than technical conclusions and that the agency has no authority to order a parts manufacturer to carry out recalls, which ARC contends are the responsibility of automakers.  In a letter to NHTSA, ARC said no automaker has found a defect common to all 67 million inflators, and no root cause has been identified in the inflator ruptures.  ""ARC believes they resulted from random 'one-off' manufacturing anomalies that were properly addressed by vehicle manufacturers through lot-specific recalls,"" the letter said.  In a statement, NHTSA indicated that both ARC and automakers are responsible for recalls and that it can seek a recall from a parts maker that supplies multiple automakers.  The next step is for NHTSA to issue a final ruling on whether the inflators are defective, then hold a public hearing. It potentially could take ARC to court to seek a recall order. NHTSA would not say when or whether any of this will happen.  In the meantime, owners of vehicles made by at least a dozen automakers -- Chevrolet, Buick, GMC, Ford, Toyota, Stellantis, Volkswagen, Audi, BMW, Porsche, Hyundai and Kia -- are left to wonder anxiously whether their vehicles contain driver or front passenger inflators made by ARC. (Some vehicles have ARC inflators on both sides.)  Because ARC supplies inflators that are included in other manufacturers' airbags, there's no easy way for vehicle owners to determine whether their inflators are made by ARC. Neither NHTSA nor ARC nor the automakers have released a full list of affected models.  The standoff with ARC has sent automakers struggling to find out just how many of their vehicles contain the inflators. The auto manufacturers are also asking NHTSA whether they must start doing recalls. Automakers know many of the models affected. But many say they're still gathering information from later model years to determine which vehicles contain the affected inflators.  ""We are still investigating,"" said Maria Buczkowski, a spokeswoman for Ford. ""We have not had any ARC airbag inflators rupture in the field.""  James Bell, a Kia spokesman, said, ""We do not have a final count on vehicles that were built with ARC inflators, but the team is collecting the data.""  Toyota confirmed that some of its vehicles have ARC inflators but wouldn't comment further.  Other automakers said they were trying to find a cause and were working with the government or didn't respond to requests from The Associated Press for information.  NHTSA contends that byproducts from welding during manufacturing can clog a vent inside the inflator canister that's designed to let gas escape to fill air bags quickly in a crash. Pressure can build to the point where the canister is blown apart.  Michael Brooks, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety, called on NHTSA and the automakers to release a list of affected models.  ""Customers, I think, have a right to know if there's a potential defect in their car, particularly if it's sitting a few inches from their chest and can explode,"" Brooks said.  The situation, he said, is reminiscent of the early stages of the Takata air bag inflator recalls in 2001. It took years for all the affected vehicle models to be announced.  Both ARC and Takata used ammonium nitrate to inflate air bags. Takata's situation was more dangerous, Brooks said, because in its inflators, the chemical could deteriorate over time when exposed to high heat and humidity. Unlike Takata, ARC uses ammonium nitrate only as a secondary chemical to inflate air bags. ARC's problem appears to derive instead from a manufacturing defect.  From 2017 to 2022, the ARC problems triggered seven small recalls from automakers. On Friday, the same day NHTSA announced its action against ARC, General Motors announced the recall of nearly 1 million more.  The company said it's recalling certain 2014 through 2017 GMC Acadia, Chevy Traverse and Buick Enclave SUVs because the ARC inflators can explode. The recall came after GM was told this year that the driver's air bag ruptured in a 2017 Traverse. GM, which says it doesn't know what caused the inflator to explode, has hired an engineering firm to help investigate.  ""We disagree with NHTSA's new sweeping request when extensive field testing has found no inherent defect,"" ARC said in a statement.  While the recall demand is being sorted out, Brooks of the Center for Auto Safety recommends that owners of vehicles from the 12 affected brands insist that dealers disclose whether their particular vehicle contains an ARC inflator.  ""The more customers who complain, the more pressure that puts on the manufacturers,"" he said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRleGFya2FuYWdhemV0dGUuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMy9tYXkvMjAvbW9yZS10aGFuLTMwLW1pbGxpb24tdXMtZHJpdmVycy1kb250LWtub3ctaWYv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"explosion","2023-05-21","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T22:56:28","WASHINGTON — Three U.S. government agencies are undertaking studies to examine the safety issues associated with a new generation of launch vehicles that use liquid oxygen and methane propellants.  At a May 15 meeting of the Federal Aviation Administration’s Commercial Space Transportation Advisory Group (COMSTAC), FAA officials described efforts that are underway to understand the explosive effects of that propellant combination in the event of a launch accident.  That propellant combination has been used on two launches of American vehicles to date: Relativity Space’s Terran 1 on March 22 and SpaceX’s Starship April 20. It will also be used on engines that will power Relativity’s larger Terran R as well as Blue Origin’s New Glenn, Rocket Lab’s Neutron and United Launch Alliance’s Vulcan Centaur.  Companies are attracted to liquid oxygen (LOX) and methane since it offers a higher specific impulse, a measure of efficiency, and burns cleaner than LOX and kerosene, noted Brian Rushforth, the manager of the innovation division in the FAA’s commercial space transportation office. But, there’s little information about the explosive potential of that propellant combination.  “We just don’t know the yield of the explosive enough from the FAA perspective, so that’s why we’re conducting experiments,” he said at the COMSTAC meeting. The concern is that both LOX and methane are miscible, meaning that they readily mix together, increasing its explosive potential.  Understanding that explosive potential, he said, will support FAA work on public safety, such as establishing hazard areas and refining calculations of the maximum probable loss that launch providers need to insure against.  The FAA has set up a test stand at the Dugway Proving Ground in Utah. A crane 43 meters tall will be used to drop stainless steel containers containing mixtures of LOX and methane. A series of tests is planned to start in June on three-week intervals to measure the explosive power of that propellant combination.  A second phase, tentatively scheduled for next year, will conduct similar tests with varying velocities. He said the data from those tests will be shared with other government agencies, such as NASA and the U.S. Space Force, along with launch vehicle developers.  That study is separate from one that NASA and the Space Force are working on discussed at a May 16 meeting of the human exploration and operations committee of the NASA Advisory Council. That work, agency officials said, is focused on range issues, including the effect of LOX/methane launches on operations at other pads.  “It’s really to try and understand what, if any, mitigations we need to do for some of the adjacent launch pads,” said Tonya McNair, deputy associate administrator for management in NASA’s Space Operations Mission Directorate. That work is being funded through NASA’s Launch Services Program, with some cost-sharing with the Space Force.  At the COMSTAC meeting, Rushforth said there is some coordination between the FAA and NASA/Space Force studies to avoid gaps and overlap. He noted that NASA will use the same tower for LOX/methane tests after the FAA completes its first phase of its test campaign.  He said that, for now, the FAA is taking a conservative approach in its safety analyses. “We don’t have a solid feel for the TNT equivalent of LOX/methane, so there is a degree of conservatism that we’ve introduced,” he said. “The hope is that, when we validate this, if we are being too conservative we can lessen the requirements.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9hZ2VuY2llcy1zdHVkeWluZy1zYWZldHktaXNzdWVzLW9mLWxveC1tZXRoYW5lLWxhdW5jaC12ZWhpY2xlcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Elsewhere, luxury spending slowed down in the U.S. as it surged in China, and fashion continued its love affair with film.

And you can click here to receive the Weekend Briefing in your inbox every Sunday. –Danny Parisi, sr. fashion reporter  Fashion brands have too much stuff on their hands.  Last week, Under Armour reported in its earnings that its inventory had reached over $1.2 billion in the quarter ending March 31. Profit margins fell by 3% as the company resorted to steep discounts to work through all that inventory. President and CEO Stephanie Linnartz said there was a “sector-wide inventory malaise” across apparel leading to more discounting.  In January, our sister site Modern Retail reported on the “We made too much” sale trend employed by brands like Lululemon, Ursa Major and womenswear brand Carleen, turning their overproduction into a selling point. But in a tough economic environment, extra inventory is no joke. Margins are already compressed for many brands across the sector as costs of customer acquisition and production go up and spending is down. Even shipping costs getting slightly more affordable in recent months haven’t been enough to offset it.  At the Glossy E-Commerce Forum in Manhattan on Monday, a number of attendees and speakers spoke about the dangers of excessive discounting.  “The sluggish market really keeps me up at night,” said Heather Kaminetsky, on stage with our editor-in-chief, Jill Manoff. “Discounting is a race to the bottom. Lots of people have tons of inventory out in the market, but where is it going to go?”  Luxury slows down in the US, surges in China  Speaking of the “macroeconomic situation” — executives’ favorite euphemism for the combination of inflation, reduced spending and an uncertain jobs market — Canada Goose also reported earnings last week. The company saw U.S. revenue decline by 4.5%.  It blamed that decline on “the macroeconomics,” particularly the decline in luxury spending by the American consumer. In April, even LVMH, which has otherwise seen sales rising across the board, cautioned about a luxury slowdown in the U.S. LVMH saw an 8% increase in U.S. sales last quarter, but the company said that was due primarily to the success of Sephora in the region. Excluding Sephora, sales of LVMH goods have been flat in America.  Meanwhile, Canada Goose saw a 65% explosion of sales in Asia, which helped offset its declining sales in the U.S. After a rough couple of quarters, luxury spending in China seems to have returned with a vengeance.  Fashion x Film in Cannes and Venice  This past week was a good one for people, like me, who love both fashion and film. The Cannes Film Festival in France started on Tuesday. It will host the premieres of some movies I’m excited for, like Martin Scorcese’s “Killers of the Flower Moon.” Early red carpet standouts at Cannes have included Cate Blanchett’s Louis Vuitton two-piece look and Aishwarya Rai’s elaborate metallic gown.  Elsewhere in the film/fashion crossover world, Giorgio Armani announced that he’ll host a couture show in Venice in September to coincide with the Venice Film Festival.  Fashion and film have always been natural bedfellows. Influential designer Tom Ford even made the jump to directing films. Another Cannes film I’m excited for is Pedro Almodóvar’s “Strange Way of Life,” which was the first film commissioned by the newly launched Saint Laurent Productions and will feature designs by Saint Laurent creative director Anthony Vacarello. Saint Laurent’s film production company officially launched in April and is reported to be working with other filmmakers including Wong Kar-Wai, Paolo Sorrentino and David Cronenberg. I’m normally not one for branded content, but these are some of my favorite directors of all time, so count me in. Now I just need to secure an invite to Cannes next year.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb3NzeS5jby9mYXNoaW9uL3dlZWtlbmQtYnJpZWZpbmctZXhjZXNzLWludmVudG9yeS1jb250aW51ZXMtdG8tcGxhZ3VlLWZhc2hpb24tYnJhbmRzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

When asked about the future of Leviss and Sandoval in the ""Vanderpump Rules"" universe following their scandalous affair, the ""Real Housewives of Beverly Hills"" star revealed that she hasn't had any recent communication with Leviss.  She expressed that Leviss needs to discuss what's happening in her life with the group, while also acknowledging Sandoval's longstanding presence within the cast and their business collaborations.  Vanderpump stated, ""You know, four years before the show... That's what I hope for them. I don't think you can just shut the door on somebody. I think we're all guilty of some things... maybe not that. But there must be some discussion, and I think we'll be there for it.""  Vanderpump further admitted that the finale episode of ""Vanderpump Rules"" was particularly challenging for her to watch. She disclosed that the episode was filmed some time after the completion of the season, making the emotions raw and palpable. As a producer, Vanderpump usually enjoys the ""ins and outs and shenanigans"" of the show, but it becomes more challenging when she becomes emotionally invested in the group.  Despite condemning Sandoval's actions, Vanderpump confessed that her heart broke for both him and Leviss. She stated, ""Of course, what he did... it cannot be condoned in any way, shape, or form. But still, to see the utter misery and the devastation of the fallout.""  These revelations come in the wake of Sandoval and Leviss' separation, which occurred just two months after their affair was exposed, leading to the end of Sandoval's nine-year relationship with Ariana Madix. During the season 10 finale, Vanderpump had a conversation with Sandoval, showcasing her unique approach to supporting this group of friends.  She revealed that she doesn't adhere to strict rules and chose not to ""pile on"" the catastrophe by taking sides. Vanderpump emphasized that she condemned Sandoval's actions but couldn't write him off as a person because of one mistake. She explained her perspective by saying, ""I feel like a mother to some of these children. So, when he's been criticized by the whole world, what will I do, pile on? No, I'm going to try and have a modicum of... not empathy, I don't have empathy... but a modicum of hope. Maybe for the future.""  In April, Leviss sought treatment at a facility to address her mental health, as confirmed by a source. Leviss and her family had decided on this course of action before the affair was exposed, and Bravo and production were aware and supportive of her journey toward better mental health.  As the fallout from the scandal continues, Leviss released a statement in March acknowledging her behavior and commitment to self-reflection. She mentioned seeking guidance from a counselor and understanding her patterns of codependency and addiction to feeling loved. Leviss expressed her desire to make healthier choices and prioritize her well-being over unhealthy intimate connections that may negatively affect others and her friendships.

"explosion","2023-05-18","Not Discerned","{""West"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T10:09:30","If you were to make a wild stab at which books were the most popular, what would you choose? Your personal favourites — say, mysteries, or big sagas, blockbuster reads from writers such as John Irving or Stephen King?  The book industry is having a fine romance: with books about love.  Romance for a new generation  One of the authors who has helped cement the place of romance in the popular imagination — or at least on the bestsellers lists — is Colleen Hoover. Her “It Ends With Us” was the No. 1 bestselling book in Canada in 2022. According to BookNet Canada, Hoover’s books alone drove a 55-per-cent increase in the romance category when compared with 2021, with five of her titles topping the list.  The same trend was seen in the United States. Publishers Weekly reported that “unit sales of fiction titles rose 8.5 per cent over 2021, led by a 52.4-per-cent increase in sales of romance books.” And those sales were driven in large part by, you guessed it, Colleen Hoover.  “The list of bestselling romance titles in 2022 is … led by Colleen Hoover, whose ‘It Starts With Us’ and ‘It Ends With Us’ topped the romance charts. Those two books, along with a handful of other Hoover titles, resulted in a banner year for Simon & Schuster …”  Hoover is published in Canada by Simon & Schuster, which noted in an email to the Star that the author has sold more than 24 million copies of her English-language books “in all formats” across the world. It has seen its sales of romance books “skyrocket” as a result.  Much of this traffic is driven by younger readers. According to BookNet Canada, the hashtag #RomanceRecs has more than 390 million views on TikTok, “an undeniable source of influence on book-reading behaviour.” It’s an observation that Simon & Schuster echoes.  “An increasing number of younger, and often more diverse readers have discovered and embraced this genre, much of it fuelled by BookTok,” the publisher said in a statement. “Where sales have traditionally been driven by retailer merchandising and press coverage, a lot of the original buzz for these books was driven by enthusiastic BookTok readers.”  The Harlequin effect  There used to be a saying: that 4.1 Harlequin romances sold around the world every second. That particular publisher was, at one time, the first name that sprang to mind when the words “books” and “romance” were mentioned.  And it’s still going strong. Dianne Moggy, vice-president of editorial for the Harlequin Brand Group, which includes 11 category lines, noted that they publish more than 800 romance titles a year. And they’re not all those paperbacks we remember from our parents’ bookcases or grocery store shelves: roughly 40 per cent of their books sell digitally.  The genre’s popularity has driven a deep change in the content of books and an increased focus on giving readers what they want.  “We’ve really been trying to increase the representation across every series we publish,” Moggy said. “So we’re trying to ensure that our readers are actually seeing themselves reflected in the books … whether it’s race and ethnicity or body image or neurodiversity.”  Those concerns have translated into sales in the Canadian market. BookNet Canada recorded that sales in romance featuring LGBTQ characters increased by 10,406 per cent between 2017 and 2022, with sales from 2020 to ’21 increasing 301 per cent, and from ’21 to ’22 by 136 per cent. Fiction romance in the workplace rose by 1,793 per cent during that five-year period, and for African American and Black categories by 1,733 per cent.  The desire for more representative romance is an aspect of the genre that attracts Muslim writer Uzma Jalaluddin, whose latest, “Much Ado About Nada,” comes out in June.  “I’m attracted to the subversive aspects of romance, the ways that romance writers (like myself) use the tropes and expectations of this genre to explore other issues, such as identity, immigration or prejudice,” she said. And so she writes love stories set in immigrant neighbourhoods with South Asian, Muslim characters.  “When I wrote ‘Much Ado About Nada’ I set it in a massive Muslim conference in Toronto,” said Jalaluddin. “As much as my book is a swoony second-chance romance, it’s also about Muslims having fun and inviting the reader into their space.  “After all, love is love no matter who you are, how you dress or what you believe. Also, no one else was writing them. (I’m glad that’s changing now.)”  Stomping on the tropes and using them in new ways  HarperCollins, whose parent company News Corp. bought Harlequin from the Toronto Star’s parent company, Torstar Corp., for $455 million in 2014, is like many publishers, increasing the number of trade paperback or hardcover romances it offers.  “I think the definition of romance has spilled into a number of different areas,” said Margaret O’Neill Marbury, a VP at HarperCollins, responsible for trade titles at the company that owns Harlequin.  Popular American writer Curtis Sittenfeld, who publishes with Random House, has recently waded into the genre with her latest novel, “Romantic Comedy.”  It sets up an interesting dynamic, showing at first the typical dorky, not-so-good-looking guy with the gorgeous model. Then she flips that trope on its head by having the dorky, not-so-gorgeous writer develop a crush on a famous pop star who used to date models.  The book becomes an examination of gender relations and the rituals of romance, yes, but it also does something traditional romances do: has an emotional arc, strong characters you can relate to, some drama that keeps them apart and, well, a happy ending.  “I thought that it would be fun. That was my main motivation. I started it in the summer of 2021,” said Sittenfeld in an interview. “So it was the pandemic, I guess it was about 15 months or 16 months in, and it felt like a pretty dark time, I think, globally and personally. I definitely wrote ‘Romantic Comedy’ for escapist pleasure for myself. And then I hoped, eventually, for readers.”  “Some people will say that romance is just ChickLit reinvented,” said Canadian author Chantel Guertin, whose latest book is “Two for the Road.”  She argued that romance now is not “a 20-something girl who’s bumbling through life trying to find a guy. Now the heroines are so strong and they are self-assured, and very successful and have great careers. That romance element is part of it, but as a person they have got it figured out.”  And, while in the more traditional romance, the happy ending is a must, commercial or trade fiction stories don’t always have to have one, Marbury said, “but they do have to be hopeful,” and there still has to be a strong relationship or pull between the characters. Think of writers such as Nicholas Sparks, Emily Giffin and Jojo Moyes.  The “happily ever after” is the point  But the happy ending has a big role to play, and a lot of readers and writers like it that way.  Romance book sales grew throughout the pandemic, a time of uncertainty, as Guertin pointed out. “We often felt as if we had no control of our situations and we certainly didn’t know what things were going to look like in the next few months.  “Once you know the book is going to end happily, you remove that layer of unsettling and uncertainty, and then you actually enjoy the ride of the journey of the story, which actually is often very complex,” Guertin said. “And you can really delve into the characters and their stories because you’re not concerned about how it’s going to end.”  And you can escape from the reality of the everyday.  Jalaluddin, too, is a believer in the happily-ever-after ending. “Partly this is because I’m a hopeless romantic, wrapped in the outer trappings of a cynic,” she said.  “But mostly it’s because I’m attracted to optimistic stories that demonstrate the good in humanity; and romance novels, with their focus on love, relationships, problem-solving, a dash of adventure or intrigue, are at their heart heaped with optimism. It is baked into the very DNA of the genre, because no matter what else happens there will be a happy ending for all. Who can resist that?”  Certainly not the readers buying those millions of romance books being sold every year and those who, during the pandemic, turned to the genre for an emotional and psychological lift.  Can artificial intelligence write us a love story?  As romance continues to modernize its approach, it seems as if it might be particularly vulnerable to being written, perhaps unknowingly to readers, by artificial intelligence, including ChatGPT and others. With its fairly predictable structure, it would seem a particularly promising genre for AI to target.  “We’re not looking to AI to generate content at all,” said Moggy. “But it’s a big concern in terms of the number of submissions we get and how do we police that?”  She noted that they received a submission earlier in the week we spoke and weren’t sure whether it was AI-generated or not. “But it certainly is very similar to another book we have published.”  While AI might be helpful in terms of writing marketing copy based on metadata, for example, when it comes to the creative process and content, “that’s where I get very nervous about things,” said Marbury.  It’s romance, after all. And doesn’t it all come down to love? Can an algorithm capture emotion? It’s a question we’ve been asking since Hal in “2001: A Space Odyssey.”  “I think you’ve hit the real point here,” said Moggy. “Can it bring the emotion, which is what the reader connects to … if that emotion is missed, then I think you’d miss what the romance reader is looking for.”  Hopefully, for the industry — and writers and readers — this will result in a happy ending.

The star lies in the so-called Pinwheel Galaxy (M101) which lies around 21 million light years away.  “This means that the event actually happened 21 million years ago, the light of the explosion having travelled across the universe since that time until it finally reached us,” said Prof. Joseph Caruana, from the University of Malta’s Department of Physics and Institute of Space Sciences and Astronomy.  The event in question is known as a Type II supernova. This occurs when a massive star – several times more massive than our sun – is unable to sustain nuclear fusion any further, thus undergoing a rapid collapse that ends with a catastrophic explosion.  The supernova, dubbed SN 2023ixf, was reported on the 19 May by Koichi Itagaki. A notification system for astronomers around the world allows them to follow up with further observations.  “Yesterday, some amongst the amateur astronomy community in Malta – the Astronomical Society of Malta – were already discussing this object with us,” said Caruana, who recorded the image throughout the night of Saturday 20 and Sunday 21 May, remarking that it was quite exciting to witness such an event just a few days after the observatory in Gozo had started operating.  “When you look at the image, the supernova looks just like a tiny dot amongst many others. But that tiny dot represents an extremely violent event whose light has travelled an immense distance. It really gives you pause.”  Astronomers around the world – both professional and amateur – will be turning their telescopes to this object over the coming days. Observations of such events often involve collaboration between professional and amateur astronomers.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYWx0YXRvZGF5LmNvbS5tdC9lbnZpcm9ubWVudC9lbnZpcm9ubWVudC8xMjMwMTEvbWFsdGFfb2JzZXJ2YXRvcnlfcmVjb3Jkc19leHBsb2Rpbmdfc3Rhcl8yMV9taWxsaW9uX2xpZ2h0X3llYXJzX2F3YXnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The festival began in 2012, but was canceled for a few years due to the coronavirus pandemic. It celebrates the annual alewife migration, when the fish travel upstream for about a month in the spring to reach lakes and ponds to spawn.  “We’re hoping to continue bringing a greater awareness to the importance of the alewives and the Sebasticook River, and also to come together as a community,” said organizer Amy Gagnon earlier this week.  Festivalgoers congregated Saturday at the Benton Riverside Park by the town hall to browse stalls offering food, canned goods, wood carving demonstrations and information on local wildlife including alewives. People could then migrate down a walking path from the park to the Benton Falls Dam for a tour of the fish lift at the dam. Live music from bluegrass band The Oystermen provided the day’s soundtrack.  At Benton Falls, tens of people at a time lined the dam, leaning over the railings to catch a glimpse of the millions of fish passing over using a fish elevator.  It’s a recent marvel: for decades, alewives’ migration up the Sebasticook River was blocked. In 2008, the fish population at Benton Falls was estimated at just 400,000.  Advertisement  But the removal of the Edwards Dam on the Kennebec River in Augusta and the Fort Halifax Dam in Winslow, along with other restoration efforts, now allow the fish to travel up again. In 2022, there were an estimated 2.7 million fish counted at Benton Falls Dam, according to the Maine Department of Marine Resources.  Festivalgoers were eager to celebrate that fact on Saturday for the first time in years.  “It’s good to have these kinds of community events opening up again,” said Benton-based forest ranger Timothy Kjellman. Kjellman was on hand to represent the Maine Forest Service and teach local kids about fire safety and wildfire prevention.  A couple vendors had made an annual appearance at the festival before it was suspended, including wood carving instructor Steven Valleau, an artist-in-residence at the Wendell Gilley Museum in Southwest Harbor.  “I feel like now I’m back here, COVID is officially over,” Valleau joked. “It’s awesome.”  Also returning with a stall were representatives from the Sebasticook River Land Trust, on hand to explain to people headed down to the falls the importance of alewives to the area, and raise awareness about ongoing conservation efforts across the watershed.  Advertisement  Doug Wescott, a land trust board member, said that alewives are hugely important to the region’s watershed.  “There’s a big issue in a lot of lakes in Maine with phosphorus,” Wescott said.  Phosphorus is an essential nutrient for plant life but when there is too much of it in water it can speed up something called eutrophication, which causes a dense growth of algae and depletes oxygen levels.  Alewives, Wescott said, eat the algae produced by excess nutrients in the lake like phosphorus, effectively cleaning up the lake and mitigating the potential for an algal bloom.  The removal of the dams was a godsend to the Sebasticook River watershed, Wescott said. “They were interfering with natural processes … I don’t think anyone knew at the time how many alewives would come here.”  Since then, the Sebasticook has become one of the biggest alewife runs on the East Coast. Wescott said that the 5-mile section of the Sebasticook River in Benton and Winslow has become the area with the largest concentration of bald eagles on the East Coast.  “And it’s all because of the alewives,” he said.

Devers and his friend and former teammate, Padres shortstop Xander Bogaerts, took the lineup cards out for the pregame exchange and hugged. Devers then circled the bases in front of Bogaerts in consecutive innings in his 14th career multi-homer game.  Devers hit a solo shot to right so hard leading off the second that he stumbled back a few steps before starting his trot. He hit a three-run homer nearly to the base of the batter's eye in straightaway center field with no outs in the five-run third for a 6-0 lead. He has 13 homers this season.  Both came off lefty Blake Snell (1-6), who allowed six runs and five hits in four innings.  Before the game, Bogaerts said he hoped Devers didn't hit any homers because “he's a dangerous guy. He's truly one of a kind.""  Devers proved his friend right.  “Very happy today that I was able to hit two runs but you have to keep doing adjustments every day,” Devers said through a translator.  “He put two great swings,” manager Alex Cora said. “Around him, everybody put up good at-bats. That was impressive, the third inning. We were grinding at-bats, fouling off pitches, staying on pitches, taking our walks. It was a fun inning.”  Rob Refsnyder hit a two-run, bases-loaded double ahead of Devers' three-run shot to help the Red Sox to their third straight win.  Other than Fernando Tatis Jr.'s leadoff homer in the third off James Paxton (1-0), the Padres' offensive struggles continued on a day when slugger Manny Machado went on the 10-day injured list with a hairline fracture in his left hand. The Padres were booed at game's end, just as they were Wednesday after a loss to Kansas City. They fell to five games under .500 and are 8 1/2 games behind the NL West-leading Los Angeles Dodgers and just one game ahead of the last-place Colorado Rockies.  The Padres managed just Tatis' homer, his sixth, and four singles in six innings off Paxton, who was making only his second start of 2023. He made his Red Sox debut a week earlier, his first big league appearance since April 6, 2021, with Seattle. He missed most of the 2020-22 seasons due to injuries and had Tommy John surgery on April 12, 2021.  “It feels great, just really to contribute to the team and be here pitching again,” said Paxton, who earned his first victory since Aug. 15, 2020, against Boston while he was with the New York Yankees.  Paxton said Devers is ""awesome. His swing is amazing. So good on offense and he does a great job at third base, too. Just an all-around fantastic player, fun to watch.”  Josh Winckowski pitched the final three innings for his second save.  Bogaerts, who left the Red Sox as a free agent and signed a $280 million, 11-year contract in December, was robbed of a single by diving right fielder Alex Verdugo to end the fifth.  EXPLOSION IN SINGLE-A CLUBHOUSE  Two contract workers were burned in a natural gas explosion in the home clubhouse of the Lake Elsinore Storm, the Padres' Class-A affiliate, leading to Friday's game being postponed. The two workers were taken to a hospital. The Padres said no players were involved.  DEVERS AND BOGEY  Devers and Bogaerts went out to eat Thursday, an off day for both teams. “You know what's crazy is, I forgot my wallet at home. I'm not even kidding,"" Bogaerts said. He thought he left it at the ballpark but didn't find it there, and started to get nervous. “I said, 'Man, you've got to pick this up. I don't even have a dollar.'"" Bogaerts said he found his wallet at home, in his backpack, where he put it during the bus ride home from Dodger Stadium last Sunday. ”I haven't told him that piece yet but I told him right away that he's got to pay,” Bogaerts said.  TRAINER'S ROOM  Red Sox: 1B Justin Turner, who was aboard for Devers' three-run shot, left the game with left knee soreness.  Padres: Machado's was hurt when he was hit by a pitch Monday night. His IL stint is retroactive to Tuesday. Manager Bob Melvin said there’s a possibility Machado can return when the Padres play at the New York Yankees next weekend.  UP NEXT  Saturday night's game will feature a marquee matchup between Red Sox LHP Chris Sale (3-2, 5.40 ERA) and Padres RHP Joe Musgrove (1-1, 6.63).","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vc3BlY3RydW1sb2NhbG5ld3MuY29tL21lL21haW5lL3Nwb3J0cy8yMDIzLzA1LzIwL2RldmVycy1ob21lcnMtdHdpY2UtLWRyaXZlcy1pbi00LWFzLXJlZC1zb3gtYmVhdC1zdGFnZ2VyaW5nLXBhZHJlcy02LTHSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(KSNB) - When it comes to bombs and explosives we often think of police department bomb squad, but firefighters have some knowledge on that too.  During the 86th annual Nebraska State Fire School, they learned about explosives in one of the featured classes.  Nebraska State Patrol educated firefighters about different elements that compose an explosive device. They even were treated to seeing a few explosions to understand the power packed in each kind of explosive.  “Many people don’t think about that,’ said Jimmy Lawson, Class Coordinator at Nebraska State Fire School. “That this is going to be a situation involving some type of explosive but they need at least the basic training. Enough to understand the dangers, safety precautions, and certainly enough to protect themselves before they go rushing in and getting hurt themselves.”  For some firefighters, it was about just knowing the resources exist.  “Well I think that we learned that we have, that Nebraska has available resources for us as firefighters and the general public and that it happens more than you think and that it’s all about safety; so we learned a lot today,” said Kalah Bergmann, firefighter at Gretna Fire Department.

Cameras pointed at the Popocatépetl volcano, which is about 40 miles southeast of the capital city, have shown increased clouds of gasses and ash leaving the volcano after a reported uptick of activity inside the mountain.  The Mexican government has issued a yellow alert and urged residents to stay away from the volcano due to falling debris.  Earlier in the week, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported communities nearest to Popocatépetl closed schools and opened evacuation shelters.  According to the Global Volcanism Program, the current eruption cycle has been ongoing since 2005 and has included numerous episodes of increased emissions.  4 CLASSIC TYPES OF VOLCANOES  next Image 1 of 4  prev next Image 2 of 4  prev next Image 3 of 4  prev Image 4 of 4  During the shutdown of Mexico’s busiest airport, personnel inspected and cleaned critical infrastructure from ash.

"explosion","2017-07-23","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T01:28:18","At a vicious PGA Championship, the only joy is misery  Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter  Share by Email  Rory McIlroy survived through a brutal Saturday at the PGA. He's one of the few. Getty Images  ROCHESTER, N.Y. — As he stood over the chip on the 17th hole that could well sink his PGA Championship, Rory McIlroy looked, well, miserable.  His face wore a pained expression. His hands fidgeted in small, sudden movements. He talked with his caddie and longtime friend, Harry Diamond, in frustrated quips. He walked in staccato strides to the green and back, searching for some clue on how to execute.  He stepped up to the ball. He paused. He stepped away. He stepped up again. He committed.  And then … an explosion of sound — not the literal kind — erupting from the 15th green just a 5-iron away.  Rory stepped off his ball again. He turned back to Harry exasperated. If looks could kill, McIlroy’s might well have had the strength of a cruise missile.  But looks can’t kill, and so Rory had no choice but to play his short-sided wedge shot off a tight, greenside lie and up toward the flagstick … for par. For the moment, the cruise missile sounded better.  His ball scared the hole for just a second, electing instead to settle neatly just a short putt away. McIlroy would have to take bogey, his fourth and final of the day at Oak Hill. As he walked away from the flagstick he looked up at the sky. For the moment, his tournament had been saved.  McIlroy is a demonstrative golfer, but his experience on Saturday afternoon at the PGA Championship was not an unusual one. Misery was the only path to contention on Saturday at Oak Hill, which has proven as proper and demanding a major championship test as we have seen in professional golf in some time.  Misery in the rain. Misery in the mud. Misery off the tee. Misery around the green. It was everywhere.  The only people who managed were those with the mental makeup to endure such disenchantment for the better part of five hours. It should come as no surprise that also amounts to a who’s who of major championship stalwarts. On Saturday night, the first seven names on the leaderboard feature the last names Koepka (six under), Hovland (five under), Conners (five under), DeChambeau (three under), Rose (two under), Scheffler (two under) and McIlroy (one under).  “I think this tournament and especially in these conditions and on this golf course, the non-physical parts of the game I think are way more important this week than the physical parts of the game,” McIlroy said after it was over Saturday, his body language still recovering from the beating. “I think I’ve done those well, and that’s the reason that I’m in a decent position.”  The eighth name of the leaderboard, however, is not a major championship regular — nor a professional golf regular. He is PGA teaching professional Michael Block, who may be about the last person anyone expected to see six strokes off Koepka’s six-under lead come Sunday morning. Block was the cause of the eruption of noise on the 15th green behind McIlroy, his birdie on the hole igniting the upstate New York faithful.  What’s Block’s secret? Well, he may be the only PGA professional in the field silly enough to think he belongs there. And, as it turns out, he just might.  “No. I mean, if anything, I love Rosey, but I can compete against these guys,” he said Saturday. “I can compete against them. I can hang. I can post a three or four under tomorrow, especially if I get the fairways rolling again.”  Block might not have a Tour pro’s driving distance or putting ability, but he has a major champion’s delusion. That, it turns out, was an absolutely essential piece of the puzzle in an inch of rain Saturday at Oak Hill, when no reasonable person would have believed earnestly that it was an enjoyable experience.  “I doubt if anybody on this entire property loves golf as much as I love golf. Period,” he said. “[One day] I’ll look back at this week and I’ll say, ‘I’m glad you enjoyed it. I’m glad you enjoyed the moment.'”  Koepka, your 54-hole leader, certainly enjoyed the misery. A month after a decidedly uncharacteristic Sunday fade at the Masters, he stalked around Rochester like a hungry lion. On a day when only nine golfers shot rounds under par, Koepka shot 66, posting the round of the day by two strokes and placing himself a stroke clear of the field heading into Sunday.  “Learning what I learned at Augusta kind of helped today. To just never think the way I thought going into the final round. I won’t do it again the rest of my career,” Koepka said, although he chose not to elaborate on exactly what that thinking was. “That doesn’t mean that you can’t go play bad — you can play good, you’ll play bad — but I’ll never have that mindset.”  Koepka entered Saturday with a sideshow within reason: his first major pairing with Bryson DeChambeau since the start of an acrimonious feud at this very tournament two years ago. But if there was a circus on Saturday, Koepka didn’t notice.  “I’ll be honest with you, I don’t pay too much attention to who I’m playing with,” he said. “I don’t talk a lot. I’m more focused on what I’ve got to do. Especially today with the rain, trying to stay dry, there are other things to have to worry about.”  As we turn to Sunday, it’s unlikely the agony will stop. The weather will improve for the final round, but the challenge will not. Who knew the road to glory was paved with broken souls?  Evidently, McIlroy, who shared an all-too-familiar grimace when asked if he thought he could find a final-round 65.  “I hope so,” he said, pausing briefly. “I need to keep hope.”  On Sunday, the PGA Championship will crown a winner. But right now there are no winners.  Only survivors.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vZ29sZi5jb20vbmV3cy9wZ2EtY2hhbXBpb25zaGlwLW9ubHktam95LWFnb255LXNhdHVyZGF5L9IBP2h0dHBzOi8vZ29sZi5jb20vbmV3cy9wZ2EtY2hhbXBpb25zaGlwLW9ubHktam95LWFnb255LXNhdHVyZGF5Lw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

But two Stony Brook University professors are part of a project designed to do just that — an effort scientists say is making advances.  Researchers in the NASA-backed project last week published an article in the journal Science detailing their work, which was done largely with the Hubble Space Telescope.  Simon Birrer, an assistant professor in Stony Brook’s Department of Physics and Astronomy, called the study “a milestone” and cutting-edge in trying to determine the size of the universe.  The team consists of about 30 scientists from around the globe, with the majority in the United States. They include the lead author, Patrick Kelly from the University of Minnesota.  WHAT TO KNOW Two Stony Brook University professors are among the scientists participating in a NASA-backed project trying to determine the size of the universe.  are among the scientists participating in a NASA-backed project trying to determine the size of the universe. The researchers focused on a particular supernova — or a star that suddenly dissolved through an explosion during which it increased its brightness tremendously.  on a particular supernova — or a star that suddenly dissolved through an explosion during which it increased its brightness tremendously. By comparing where the supernova first appeared to where it appeared a year later, the scientists got an idea of how far away the supernova is — and by extension how large the universe might be.  Their focus was on a supernova — or a star that suddenly dissolved through a catastrophic explosion during which it increased its brightness tremendously. This one was, as Birrer put it in a bit of Star Wars lexicon, spotted in 2014 “in a galaxy far, far away.”  Sign up for the Suffolk news this week newsletter The biggest news, politics and crime stories in Suffolk County, in your inbox every Friday at noon. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.  Researchers saw the supernova, called Refsdal, through NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope.  The scientists predicted where they would see yet another image of the very same light flare of the supernova exploding in 2015, which would give them an idea of how far away the supernova is — and by extension how large the universe might be.  They were correct. The supernova Refsdal explosion was indeed visible again that year at the location they expected, Birrer said.  It wasn’t easy to find the supernovae, yet alone one that appears multiple times at different locations, due to a phenomenon called gravitational lensing, he said. Plus, supernova explosions are relatively rare — perhaps one every 40 years in a galaxy.  “The measurement of the expansion rate of the universe is a roller coaster,” Birrer said. But this project was an important advancement.  “The prediction and subsequent observation of the fifth image of Supernova Refsdal was a great success,” said Anja von der Linden, an associate professor in Stony Brook’s Department of Physics and Astronomy who also took part in the study.  Von der Linden was part of the team that originally discovered Supernova Refsdal and prepared the follow-up Hubble observations.  Birrer was focused on the analysis of the measurement study, including the examination of the images of the supernova captured by the Hubble.  Soon, the researchers will be adding to their work a next-generation telescope in Chile, South America, called the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, which is especially geared to spot supernovas over a large area of the sky. Using it, they hope to locate about 50 supernovae a year.  Birrer said they got “extremely lucky” in spotting supernova Refsdal with the Hubble telescope because it has a far smaller field of view and the timing had to be just right. The addition of the telescope in Chile should allow scientists to find supernovas at a rate 100 times faster, he said.  Sherry Suyu, an associate professor at the Technical Institute in Munich, Germany, who was not involved in the study, said spotting supernovas the way the researchers did has “been very rare until now,” but with the addition of the telescope in Chile they “are expected to have hundreds of such events. We are entering an exciting era with lensed supernovae!”  Wendy Freedman, a professor in the University of Chicago’s Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, who also was not involved in the study called its findings “an interesting and important contribution to” figuring out the size and history of the universe, though some issues remain to be resolved before scientists can get a final, more accurate figure.  Grasping the size of the universe is a somewhat mind-boggling exercise. The solar system with the eight planets including Earth that are revolving around the Sun is part of one galaxy — the Milky Way. And the Milky Way Galaxy has some 100 billion stars — the Sun is just one of them, Birrer said.  In the universe, there are tens of billions of galaxies, all with about as many stars as the Milky Way Galaxy, he said.  “It’s hard to grasp the dimension, even after studying the universe for more than a decade myself,” Birrer said, adding, “I guess we have to accept that we are just little fish in a big ocean.”  He added that it has been hard for humans to learn much about the universe, because it is so massive and inaccessible to travel to.  What scientists have learned mostly “comes from just staring at it and see what the universe reveals to us,” he said. “Our detective work is probably very similar to that of archaeologists. Astrophysicists are able to collect tiny fragments of the past and have to reconstruct a rich and dynamic history of the universe that still holds back many mysteries.""  As recently as 500 years ago, scientists and everyone else still believed the Earth was the center of the universe and our solar system, with the other planets and Sun revolving around it. It wasn’t until Nicolaus Copernicus’s studies in the 1500s that we understood the Earth and other planets revolve around the Sun.  Scientists estimate the age of the universe at between 12.6 billion and 13.6 billion years. The new research project should also help calculate the number more precisely, Birrer said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NkYXkuY29tL2xvbmctaXNsYW5kL3N1ZmZvbGsvdW5pdmVyc2Utc2l6ZS1zdG9ueS1icm9vay11bml2ZXJzaXR5LXhpbHAyam1x0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3c2RheS5jb20vYW1wL2xvbmctaXNsYW5kL3N1ZmZvbGsvdW5pdmVyc2Utc2l6ZS1zdG9ueS1icm9vay11bml2ZXJzaXR5LXhpbHAyam1x?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

St. Louis University alumni John O’Leary didn’t graduate at the top of his class back in 1999, but he does have a harrowing and inspiring story he shared with new SLU graduates.  Back in 1987, O’Leary watched a group of older children in his neighborhood playing with fire and gasoline. He was in a horrific accident and given a 1% chance of survival.  “I assumed, if they can do it, so can I,” said O’Leary. “With my parents gone, I walked into the garage, bent over a can of gasoline, and poured a little bit of fluid on top. [A] huge explosion, [I] find myself engulfed. [I] spent five and a half months in burn center, burned 100 percent of my body, lost my fingers.”  O’Leary attributes his professional success to his time at SLU, and he left the Class of 2023 feeling moved and empowered.  “What a phenomenal commencement address,” Rodney Mosquito said. “It’s an honor to be in the presence of someone who has overcome so many challenges. It just reminds me that I can do anything if I put my mind to it.”  SLU graduate Chloe Kepros added, “It’s awesome to hear from someone who’s also a fellow SLU student and who has been through things and come out the other side and is able to show, you know, where their life is now.”  But O’Leary stays humble.  “I was not an elite student and would not have been voted most likely to succeed,” he said.

And he didn’t always feel comfortable sharing what happened to him.  “I was invited by a Girl Scout to speak at her school,” he said. “And I made the mistake of saying yes. So that first event led to another, and another, and another.”  Now he’s spoken 2,600 times in front of millions of people.  “Not out of arrogance or ego, but to serve the one in front of us,” he explained.  He is grateful for his parents’ unconditional love. In 2004, they wrote a book called “Overwhelming Odds.” Now, O’Leary has written two books himself.  “I have a book called ‘On Fire,’ [and] another book is called ‘In Awe,’” he said. “They’re both bestsellers.

Or who was the first beatified millennial?  In our free ebook, we highlight the lives of five holy men and women, and how their example of courage, faith, and innovation in their time can inspire parish leaders in their daily work today. We walk you through the lives of:  Paul, the Apostle  Isidore of Seville  Bernardine of Siena  Blessed Carlo Acutis  Frances Cabrini  We also share the wisdom of St. John Paul II, prayers for parish leaders, and the four most important characteristics that every parish leader needs in order to serve well in today’s Church.  For a long time, parishes relied on word of mouth to attract new people to join them in celebrating the Mass and the sacraments, either through a personal invitation from a parishioner or the pastor himself. Bulletins, pulpit announcements, and emails were the go-to communication tools for leaders to keep parishioners informed. But with a shrinking population of Christians every year, these methods of growing the Church aren’t enough.  Seeing the cultural and religious shifts happening around him and the explosion of new forms of technology, St. John Paul II met with the Pontifical Council for Social Communications in 2002. Before imparting his Apostolic Blessing on the people and work of the council, he shared his concerns and challenged his brother bishops and sisters in Christ to take advantage of new opportunities:  “The Gospel lives always in conversation with culture, for the Eternal Word never ceases to be present to the Church and to humanity. If the Church holds back from culture, the Gospel itself falls silent. Therefore, we must be fearless in crossing the cultural threshold of the communications and information revolution now taking place…  “Therefore, dear Brothers and Sisters, I urge you, in all your planning, to make room for Christ. In the print media, in radio and television, in the world of cinema and the Internet, seek to open doors to him who so mercifully is the door of salvation for us. Then the mass media will be a world of genuine communication, a world not of illusion but of truth and joy. I pray fervently that this will be so, and I entrust your work to Mary, Mother of the Word made flesh. I gladly impart my Apostolic Blessing to all involved in the work of the Pontifical Council, as a pledge of Christ’s presence among you and his power upon all that you do in his name.”=  Decades later, the words of St. John Paul II are bearing fruit in the Church.  74 percent of parishes who participated in our Catholic edition of the 2023 State of Church Tech report indicated that they offered worship services both in-person and online. The Church is sharing, experimenting, and extending its ministries—and in response, people are exploring their Catholic Faith in digital spaces like never before.

Less than a dollar is actually a big enough capital to run a business in this industry. It is one of the oldest in the world, previously inaccessible to billions. Until the arrival of the internet, unless one was privileged enough or as the veterans would have it, “insane enough,” this iconic activity business was not for everyone. However, the internet changed everything as it gave it a free ride across the globe. For every sports fan, especially in Sports/football-loving countries like Turkey, sports betting is one of the easiest to carry out social/economic activities today. Until now, this wasn’t the case. Most people attribute this great leap to the internet which is quite correct. However, even in areas with full internet services and quite fair gambling regulations, without flexible payment options like the ones offered by the following bookmakers, access to the best online gambling deals markets will still be a huge limitation.  Easy payment options  At this point, we can actually think of many funding methods presently at the forefront of this massive explosion of football betting. The likes of Ewallets, credit/debit cards, and most importantly, cryptocurrencies which are gradually becoming the premier tool for accessing the massive pool of betting-related activities online are hardly missed. Initially, despite the presence of internet services and betting establishments online, bookmakers were still not able to market their services probably because the funding options were quite limited. Bank transfer which many people still consider an efficient method for accessing online betting products was the dominant instrument then. Unfortunately, just like today, not many people, especially in less economically thriving countries had bank accounts. Thus, even if they wanted to engage in online betting, without a payment method, it would only have been a wish and nothing more. Moreover, even with bank accounts, delays, charges, and several other factors discouraged many from participating in online betting. With the arrival of online payment options like Neteller, Skrill, Cash2Code, Rapid Pay, and Cryptocurrencies, access to unrestricted betting sites like;  Gambling Deals: A multipurpose betting site where punters could easily get to the best online bookmakers and casinos with reliable/flexible payment options including cryptos like USDT, BTC, and ETH; Top betting deals like the best online casino bonuses, the best bookmaker bonuses, easy Mr. Green Sign-up deals, easy Skrill betting, Crypto betting, fast deposit and withdrawals, professional customer services, and the ever refreshing long-standing welcome bonus for Unibet; top betting odds on every sporting event including the best Turkish competitions like the Turkish Super Lig and 1.

MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD FOR “FAST X”  The film’s director Louis Leterrier has spoken with several outlets about some of the creative choices made in regard to the film. First up, he chatted with EW about John Cena’s character Jakob and his death.  In the film’s final action set piece, Jakob is transporting Dom’s son Brian (Leo Abelo Perry) to safety when Dante (Jason Momoa) kidnaps him. Dom pursues him, but Jakob realizes he must protect Dom and the kid – sacrificing himself to kill Dante’s men in a massive explosion.  The move marks the end of Cena’s involvement in the franchise following his introduction as the villain in “F9”. Letterier says the death was an idea he came up with early on after meeting Cena – and the news upset the actor a bit:  “I’m like, ‘That man can be a badass but cannot be a bad guy. There’s no mean bone in his body. I said to John, ‘You will have to sacrifice yourself, to give the ultimate gift to your brother to save his son,’ and it upset him. I pitched him between two takes as I’m over there resetting the camera. I pitched him this thing and then he loved it. And that literally changed his performance because he understood where he was going. ‘I’m going to give so much love so then the sacrifice really hurts.’ And it really does hurt.”  Of course, does anyone really die in this franchise? The series is famous for resurrecting multiple seemingly dead characters, and does so again here with at least one of the cameos being Gal Gadot returnning as Gisele – last seen fallout out a plane in “Fast 6”. The reveal has raised the obvious question as to whether Han (Sung Kang) knew Gisele was alive the whole time.  Gadot confirmed her return a few hours ago on Instagram, posting photos and saying: “Missed my Fast family! I’m overwhelmed with excitement. To my fans, your continuous love and support fuels this journey. Here’s to honoring the legacy, the fans and the Fast Family that we’ve built together!”  Meanwhile, the film ends on a cliffhanger with a plane explosion seemingly taking out at least four regulars (albeit behind a hill) whilst Dante prepares to blow a dam that could seemingly kill Dom and his son.  “Fast X Part 2,” whether it be the second half of this story of the middle part of a trilogy, is slated to debut in 2025.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhcmtob3Jpem9ucy5jb20vZmFzdC14LXRlYW0tb24tY2FtZW9zLWRlYXRocy1tb3JlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"explosion","2023-05-13","Not Discerned","{""Khmelnytskyy"", ""Hmelnickij"", ""Ukraine""}","2023-05-20T22:18:57","Former KGB and security boss Nikolai Patrushev told of a 'radioactive cloud' drifting across Europe after Russian strikes hit a uranium supply - the claim has since been debunked as propaganda  Apocalyptic claims from one of Putin's closest henchmen of a radioactive cloud heading across Europe have been ridiculed by experts.  The doomsday prediction was made by Nikolai Patrushev, who has alleged the deadly cloud was wafting west from Ukraine after Russian troops hit an arms depot containing depleted uranium ammunition supplied by the UK government.  Ex-KGB Patrushev is secretary of Russia's security council and reportedly one of warlord Putin's closest security aides and maintained flames erupted high into the sky in a fiery mushroom cloud after the hit.  But after declaring Poland had already seen soaring levels of radiation following the strike, Patrushev was quickly shut down by experts who described the claims as propaganda.  “Their destruction caused a radioactive cloud now moving towards Western Europe,” Patrushev's statement said.  “And Poland has already recorded an increase in radiation.”  Image: Channel1/e2w) Channel1/e2w)  The former FSB chief and war hawk also claimed at a meeting in Syktyvkar: “Furthermore, the US is developing and already using chemical and biological weapons, including in Ukraine.  “So that’s what American aid and democracy is all about.”  Russian state TV which prominently broadcast Patrushev’s claim said he was referring to a strike on a facility in Khmelnytskyi.  “A column of smoke from the explosion rose several hundred metres and a prolonged detonation followed,” stated Channel One.  “Then there was a rise in radioactivity in the area.”  Image: Channel1/e2w) Channel1/e2w)  But experts from Khmelnytskyi National University had “debunked Russian fakes about an increase in radiation levels in the city following the attack by Russian forces on the night of 13 May,” reported Ukrinform.  “Previously, Russian propaganda began spreading information on social media and news channels about an increased radiation background in Khmelnytskyi, allegedly caused by an explosion damaging either low-enriched uranium shells or components of a bomb sent to Ukraine.”  A statement from the university said: “There is no reason to be concerned.”  In Lublin, Poland the Maria Curie-Skłodowska University said a supposed rise in radioactivity in the country - as highlighted by Patrushev - was a natural phenomenon linked to rainfall.  A spike in bismuth was caused by precipitation.  Image: Channel1/e2w) Channel1/e2w)  Independent Russian journalist Ilya Shepelin said: “At its peak, on Monday, it was….five million times lower than a life-threatening dose.”  Patrushev’s radioactive cloud threat late on Friday was mocked by the Procurator Telegram channel which ridiculed the septuagenarian as a candidate for “a medal in the field of nuclear physics”.  “Perhaps Patrushev forgot to put his glasses on, and did not see that the uranium was depleted, and therefore there was no way a radioactive cloud could come out of it,” it stated.  “In a word, the Europeans will not even notice this nightmarish threat, just like the infamous freezing [from halted gas supplies] in winter.”  Similarly, Patrushev provided no evidence for the constantly repeated Russian claim that the US is developing and deploying chemical and biological weapons in Ukraine.  Image: Getty Images) Getty Images)  In March, Russia accused Britain of triggering “genocide” by supplying Ukraine with depleted uranium tank shells.  Putin said he “will have to respond properly since the collective West will be using weapons with a nuclear component”.  Britain accused the Russians of “deliberately trying to disinform” over a “standard component and has nothing to do with nuclear weapons or capabilities”.  But Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova hit back declaring: “The use of ammunition with depleted uranium is a manifestation of genocide of the population against which it is used and the people who use them.”  They would cause radioactive damage to “everyone” living in the place where the depleted uranium tank shells are released.  “They receive it, and it’s not a one-time problem…they will live with this forever.”  This was a “scientifically proven fact” based on their use in former Yugoslavia, she alleged.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay9uZXdzL3dvcmxkLW5ld3MvcHV0aW4tc3RhZmZlcnMtZmVhci1tb25nZXJpbmctY2xhaW0tMzAwMzMxMTXSAVlodHRwczovL3d3dy5taXJyb3IuY28udWsvbmV3cy93b3JsZC1uZXdzL3B1dGluLXN0YWZmZXJzLWZlYXItbW9uZ2VyaW5nLWNsYWltLTMwMDMzMTE1LmFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"explosion","2023-07-03","Not Discerned","{""West"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T10:03:38","If you were to make a wild stab at which books were the most popular, what would you choose? Your personal favourites — say, mysteries, or big sagas, blockbuster reads from writers such as John Irving or Stephen King?  The book industry is having a fine romance: with books about love.  Romance for a new generation  One of the authors who has helped cement the place of romance in the popular imagination — or at least on the bestsellers lists — is Colleen Hoover. Her “It Ends With Us” was the No. 1 bestselling book in Canada in 2022. According to BookNet Canada, Hoover’s books alone drove a 55-per-cent increase in the romance category when compared with 2021, with five of her titles topping the list.  The same trend was seen in the United States. Publishers Weekly reported that “unit sales of fiction titles rose 8.5 per cent over 2021, led by a 52.4-per-cent increase in sales of romance books.” And those sales were driven in large part by, you guessed it, Colleen Hoover.  “The list of bestselling romance titles in 2022 is … led by Colleen Hoover, whose ‘It Starts With Us’ and ‘It Ends With Us’ topped the romance charts. Those two books, along with a handful of other Hoover titles, resulted in a banner year for Simon & Schuster …”  Hoover is published in Canada by Simon & Schuster, which noted in an email to the Star that the author has sold more than 24 million copies of her English-language books “in all formats” across the world. It has seen its sales of romance books “skyrocket” as a result.  Much of this traffic is driven by younger readers. According to BookNet Canada, the hashtag #RomanceRecs has more than 390 million views on TikTok, “an undeniable source of influence on book-reading behaviour.” It’s an observation that Simon & Schuster echoes.  “An increasing number of younger, and often more diverse readers have discovered and embraced this genre, much of it fuelled by BookTok,” the publisher said in a statement. “Where sales have traditionally been driven by retailer merchandising and press coverage, a lot of the original buzz for these books was driven by enthusiastic BookTok readers.”  The Harlequin effect  There used to be a saying: that 4.1 Harlequin romances sold around the world every second. That particular publisher was, at one time, the first name that sprang to mind when the words “books” and “romance” were mentioned.  And it’s still going strong. Dianne Moggy, vice-president of editorial for the Harlequin Brand Group, which includes 11 category lines, noted that they publish more than 800 romance titles a year. And they’re not all those paperbacks we remember from our parents’ bookcases or grocery store shelves: roughly 40 per cent of their books sell digitally.  The genre’s popularity has driven a deep change in the content of books and an increased focus on giving readers what they want.  “We’ve really been trying to increase the representation across every series we publish,” Moggy said. “So we’re trying to ensure that our readers are actually seeing themselves reflected in the books … whether it’s race and ethnicity or body image or neurodiversity.”  Those concerns have translated into sales in the Canadian market. BookNet Canada recorded that sales in romance featuring LGBTQ characters increased by 10,406 per cent between 2017 and 2022, with sales from 2020 to ’21 increasing 301 per cent, and from ’21 to ’22 by 136 per cent. Fiction romance in the workplace rose by 1,793 per cent during that five-year period, and for African American and Black categories by 1,733 per cent.  The desire for more representative romance is an aspect of the genre that attracts Muslim writer Uzma Jalaluddin, whose latest, “Much Ado About Nada,” comes out in June.  “I’m attracted to the subversive aspects of romance, the ways that romance writers (like myself) use the tropes and expectations of this genre to explore other issues, such as identity, immigration or prejudice,” she said. And so she writes love stories set in immigrant neighbourhoods with South Asian, Muslim characters.  “When I wrote ‘Much Ado About Nada’ I set it in a massive Muslim conference in Toronto,” said Jalaluddin. “As much as my book is a swoony second-chance romance, it’s also about Muslims having fun and inviting the reader into their space.  “After all, love is love no matter who you are, how you dress or what you believe. Also, no one else was writing them. (I’m glad that’s changing now.)”  Stomping on the tropes and using them in new ways  HarperCollins, whose parent company News Corp. bought Harlequin from the Toronto Star’s parent company, Torstar Corp., for $455 million in 2014, is like many publishers, increasing the number of trade paperback or hardcover romances it offers.  “I think the definition of romance has spilled into a number of different areas,” said Margaret O’Neill Marbury, a VP at HarperCollins, responsible for trade titles at the company that owns Harlequin.  Popular American writer Curtis Sittenfeld, who publishes with Random House, has recently waded into the genre with her latest novel, “Romantic Comedy.”  It sets up an interesting dynamic, showing at first the typical dorky, not-so-good-looking guy with the gorgeous model. Then she flips that trope on its head by having the dorky, not-so-gorgeous writer develop a crush on a famous pop star who used to date models.  The book becomes an examination of gender relations and the rituals of romance, yes, but it also does something traditional romances do: has an emotional arc, strong characters you can relate to, some drama that keeps them apart and, well, a happy ending.  “I thought that it would be fun. That was my main motivation. I started it in the summer of 2021,” said Sittenfeld in an interview. “So it was the pandemic, I guess it was about 15 months or 16 months in, and it felt like a pretty dark time, I think, globally and personally. I definitely wrote ‘Romantic Comedy’ for escapist pleasure for myself. And then I hoped, eventually, for readers.”  “Some people will say that romance is just ChickLit reinvented,” said Canadian author Chantel Guertin, whose latest book is “Two for the Road.”  She argued that romance now is not “a 20-something girl who’s bumbling through life trying to find a guy. Now the heroines are so strong and they are self-assured, and very successful and have great careers. That romance element is part of it, but as a person they have got it figured out.”  And, while in the more traditional romance, the happy ending is a must, commercial or trade fiction stories don’t always have to have one, Marbury said, “but they do have to be hopeful,” and there still has to be a strong relationship or pull between the characters. Think of writers such as Nicholas Sparks, Emily Giffin and Jojo Moyes.  The “happily ever after” is the point  But the happy ending has a big role to play, and a lot of readers and writers like it that way.  Romance book sales grew throughout the pandemic, a time of uncertainty, as Guertin pointed out. “We often felt as if we had no control of our situations and we certainly didn’t know what things were going to look like in the next few months.  “Once you know the book is going to end happily, you remove that layer of unsettling and uncertainty, and then you actually enjoy the ride of the journey of the story, which actually is often very complex,” Guertin said. “And you can really delve into the characters and their stories because you’re not concerned about how it’s going to end.”  And you can escape from the reality of the everyday.  Jalaluddin, too, is a believer in the happily-ever-after ending. “Partly this is because I’m a hopeless romantic, wrapped in the outer trappings of a cynic,” she said.  “But mostly it’s because I’m attracted to optimistic stories that demonstrate the good in humanity; and romance novels, with their focus on love, relationships, problem-solving, a dash of adventure or intrigue, are at their heart heaped with optimism. It is baked into the very DNA of the genre, because no matter what else happens there will be a happy ending for all. Who can resist that?”  Certainly not the readers buying those millions of romance books being sold every year and those who, during the pandemic, turned to the genre for an emotional and psychological lift.  Can artificial intelligence write us a love story?  As romance continues to modernize its approach, it seems as if it might be particularly vulnerable to being written, perhaps unknowingly to readers, by artificial intelligence, including ChatGPT and others. With its fairly predictable structure, it would seem a particularly promising genre for AI to target.  “We’re not looking to AI to generate content at all,” said Moggy. “But it’s a big concern in terms of the number of submissions we get and how do we police that?”  She noted that they received a submission earlier in the week we spoke and weren’t sure whether it was AI-generated or not. “But it certainly is very similar to another book we have published.”  While AI might be helpful in terms of writing marketing copy based on metadata, for example, when it comes to the creative process and content, “that’s where I get very nervous about things,” said Marbury.  It’s romance, after all. And doesn’t it all come down to love? Can an algorithm capture emotion? It’s a question we’ve been asking since Hal in “2001: A Space Odyssey.”  “I think you’ve hit the real point here,” said Moggy. “Can it bring the emotion, which is what the reader connects to … if that emotion is missed, then I think you’d miss what the romance reader is looking for.”  Hopefully, for the industry — and writers and readers — this will result in a happy ending.

We are taking all proper measures to investigate its cause,” W.R. Grace spokesperson Tracy Pogue said in an email.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nitric acid is a colorless liquid used to manufacture fertilizers and dyes, among other purposes. Exposure to the acid can cause discomfort, such as skin or eye irritation, or more serious health problems like lung inflammation and bronchitis.  City Councilwoman Phylicia Porter said her office scrambled Friday morning to communicate information to constituents about the latest potential environmental disaster in the area.  “This particular community has existed with these types of environmental harms for generations, I am doing everything possible within my office’s capacity to defend and advocate for them, but the environmental injustice and racism that is happening is totally disheartening,” Porter said. “There is no reasonable follow up. We’re trying to change that.”  Advertisement  In December 2021, an explosion at coal plant operated by railway company CSX in Curtis Bay created an enormous shockwave across the city but did not injure any workers. A year later the Maryland Department of the Environment settled with CSX for a $15,000 penalty and $100,000 to a local nonprofit — the South Baltimore Community Land Trust — for an environmental project. Curtis Bay residents are currently suing CSX over health concerns related to coal dust.  In March 2022, a fire at Petroleum Management Inc. in Curtis Bay killed a 52-year-old employee. Friday afternoon, residents called on Governor Wes Moore and Maryland Department of the Environment Secretary Serena McIlwain to declare an air pollution emergency in the area.

U.S. oil exports this year hit a record 4.5 million barrels per day as competitive pricing for U.S. grades and China’s reopening after COVID-19 have fueled global demand for oil.  Tanker Sonangol Porto Amboim, carrying light sweet oil, left Corpus Christi, Texas, on May 16 for Saldanha Bay on the west coast of South Africa, according to ship tracking information from Refinitiv Eikon and energy data provider Kpler.  South Africa gets most of its oil from West and Central Africa as well as Saudi Arabia, according to Kpler data. But competitive pricing for U.S. crude and changes to oil flows since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have opened new markets. The last shipment of U.S. oil went to South Africa in May 2021, U.S. customs data showed.  The 850,000 barrel-cargo of West Texas Light was purchased by Swiss-commodities trader Glencore GLEN.L, a person familiar with the matter said.  Glencore’s majority-owned Astron Energy restarted production at its 100,000 barrel per day Cape Town refinery nearly three years after a deadly explosion shuttered operations and killed two workers.  Glencore declined to comment on the shipment. Astron confirmed that the refinery restarted as part of a phased process and was producing at its planned capacity.  Astron, which has the second-largest retail fuel network in southern Africa, receives its oil from tankers discharging in Saldanha Bay and transports the oil to the Cape Town refinery via pipeline, according to the refiner’s website.

"explosion","2023-05-16","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T05:01:24","NEW DELHI: The massive blast that took place last week, in an alleged firecracker factory in West Bengal’s East Medinipur district, killing at least nine people, has once again brought out how illegal firearms and bomb-making factories flourish in the hinterlands of Bengal, often with the patronage of local politicians and police.  This particular “firecracker factory” in East Medinipur’s Egra, that exploded on 16 May at around 12:30 pm had witnessed at least three blast incidents in the past, say sources in the local police.  The owner, a muscleman from the area, Bhanu Bagh, who lost his life that morning in the blast, was in this business for almost two decades. Locals say that with the blessings of the local politicians and the police, he grew his business, which flourished despite he having at least six cases under the Explosive Substances Act pending in various courts in the state.  A resident who spoke to The Sunday Guardian on telephone from Egra, said that it was not unknown as to what was going on in the factory. “Everyone knew it to be a firecracker factory, but under the garb of making firecrackers, bombs and firearms were also being manufactured. Everyone knew about it, even the police knew. Everyone got their share, so they will stay silent. During the last elections (municipal elections), a lot of bombs and ammunitions went from here. I don’t know where these went, but people would come at night and collect their parcels,” the resident who did not wish to be identified, told this newspaper.  Another resident, who is a leader in Egra, said that Bagh was a well-connected man, and that in October 2022, his factory was raided and sealed, but within a month, he secured a bail from the courts and came back and restarted his operations. “We don’t understand, every time he was caught, he secured a bail within a month and restarted his operations. He was a strongman. His son and wife, all are involved in this business. They make huge money from this and therefore everyone is kept happy and nothing happens to them in the long run. But look at destiny; this same factory has killed him now,” he told this correspondent.  The Mamata Banerjee led government, after three days of the incident, transferred the Station House Officer in charge of Egra police station, Mausam Chakraborty, and handed over the investigation to the CID.  Experts and political analysts say that bomb making factories and “illegal firecracker factories” in every rural district Bengal, have become like a “cottage industry” that operates with much impunity. This is also evident from the large number of bomb explosion cases that have been registered in West Bengal.  Officials say that districts like Malda, Murshidabad, Birbhum, North 24 Parganas, South 24 Parganas, Burdwan have many illegal factories that make crude bombs and firearms. Apparently, this trade is often practised and passed on by families from generation to generation in the rural areas.  “Rural Bengal does not have much employment opportunities, most of the youths are either into farming, or small-time work and many get themselves involved in such illegal businesses as this helps them earns a quick a buck and patronage from local politicians. The making of illegal crude bombs and country pistols and bullets is undertaken by generational makers who often operate these small factories within their premises or in small hutments in open fields. The demand for their products increases during elections, political rallies and to settle scores between politicians and musclemen. It has now become a question of survival for many in rural Bengal,” a former police officer, told this correspondent.  The large seizures of explosives from houses and fields, and incidents of high and low intensity bomb explosions are rampant in Bengal. In the last three months alone, at least five incidents of bomb explosions have been reported from West Bengal.  In February, bombs were hurled during clashes between Trinamool Congress workers in Birbhum. The incident killed two people. In March, during the Ram Navami processions in Howrah and Raiganj, bombs were hurled, gun shots fired; in March again, a crude bomb went off at the house of a TMC’s district level leader in Birbhum.  The National Investigation Agency (NIA) in the last three years has registered at least 10 cases of bomb blast and explosion under the Explosive Substances Act in Bengal in various districts of the. All of these are currently under investigation.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vc3VuZGF5Z3VhcmRpYW5saXZlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2JsYXN0LWV4cG9zZXMtYmVuZ2Fscy1pbGxlZ2FsLWZhY3Rvcmllcy1tYWtpbmctYm9tYnMtYW5kLWZpcmVhcm1z0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The 22-year-old catcher has homered twice in May and is hitting .302/.413/.547 with three homers through his first 17 games in a repeat assignment at high Single-A Fort Wayne.  A $100,000 signee out of Mexico in July 2017, Valenzuela hit himself onto the prospect radar in 2021, pairing six homers with a .307/.389/.444 batting line in 82 games at low Single-A Lake Elsinore.  Advertisement  He held his own in a 15-game call-up to the Midwest League that year (.742 OPS) but saw his numbers dip to .209/.334/.348 despite hitting a career-high 10 homers in 99 games with the TinCaps.  A heady catcher who works well with pitching staffs, Valenzuela rededicated himself to his conditioning this offseason, shedding 12 pounds and cutting his body fat by 4 to 5 percent entering spring training.  The improvements have allowed him to expand his range while blocking balls behind the plate and improve his bat speed. A year of maturity has also allowed the left-handed-hitting Valenzuela to improve his approach at the plate as he’s cut his strikeout rate from 31 percent in that 15-game call-up with Fort Wayne to 23 percent last year to 20 percent this year.  Hence the jump in slugging from .348 a year ago to .547 so far this year.  “I think he’s taking his shots a little bit more knowing he can control the strike zone,” Padres assistant farm director Mike Daly said. “He’s not afraid to hit with two strikes and that’s allowed him to be more aggressive.”  Valenzuela is ranked No. 30 among Padres prospects as ranked by MLB.com.  Storm games postponed  Low Single-A Lake Elsinore’s games on Friday and Saturday were canceled after a gas explosion injured two contracted workers at The Diamond on Friday.

Sightings came from Mackay, up to Weipa and as far inland as Mt Isa as the sky flashed green, then orange on Saturday night at around 9.20pm.  One resident in the rural town of Normanton captured the moment the display interrupted an event at the local oval.  The meteor was spotted over the airport in Cairns. Source: Facebook/Cairns Airport  Sharelle Bee captured the moment the sky turned from green to orange with the huge flash. Source: Facebook/Sharelle Bee  Sharelle Bee posted a video to Facebook, where it quickly gained 1500 shares.  “It was so bright and it ended in an explosion,” she wrote. “My heart skipped a beat and started racing.”  Cairns Airport shared vision of the moment the flash of light arcs over the nearby mountain ranges. Others thought they had seen lightning or “aliens” – describing the scenes as “crazy” and “so scary”.  “We felt the explosion here in Croydon and big loud bang,” resident Kia Peterson wrote on Facebook.  Another Croydon local said they heard the “biggest bang” and said it was “scary”.  The bang could be attributed to the meteor ‘exploding’ nearby, astronomer Ian Maclean told The Cairns Post.  “Clearly it’s exploded in the upper atmosphere somewhere in the Gulf region, west of Cairns and was felt and heard in Croydon,” Mr Maclean said.  He added the meteor’s light, at its peak, was as bright as the sun.  Australian National University’s Dr Brad Tucker told the ABC the meteor was likely 50cm to 100cm long, and would have been travelling at speeds of up to 150,000 km/h.

"explosion","2023-07-25","Not Discerned","{""Washington"", ""DistrictOfColumbia"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T05:21:00","High costs cast shadow over ChatGPT revolution  WASHINGTON  The explosion of generative AI has taken the world by storm, but one question all too rarely comes up: Who can afford it?  OpenAI bled around $540 million last year as it developed ChatGPT and says it needs $100 billion to meet its ambitions.  “We’re going to be the most capital-intensive startup in Silicon Valley history,” OpenAI’s founder Sam Altman told a U.S Senate panel recently.  And when Microsoft, which poured billions of dollars in investment into OpenAI, is asked about how much its AI adventure will cost, the company answers with assurances that it is keeping an eye on its bottom line.  Building something even near the scale of what OpenAI, Microsoft or Google have on offer would require an eye-watering investment on state-of-the-art chips and recruiting prize-winning researchers.  “People don’t realize that to do a significant amount of AI things like ChatGPT takes huge amounts of processing power. And training those models can cost tens of millions of dollars,” said Jack Gold, an independent analyst.  “How many companies can actually afford to go out and buy 10,000 Nvidia H100 systems that go for tens of thousands of dollars a piece?” asked Gold.  The answer is pretty much no one and in tech, if you can’t build the infrastructure, you rent it and that is what companies already do massively by outsourcing their computing needs to Microsoft, Google and Amazon’s AWS.  And with the advent of generative AI, this dependency on cloud computing and tech giants deepens, leaving the same players in the driver’s seat, experts warned.  From Main Street to Fortune 500, the dependency on the AI-amped will be an expensive one and companies and investors are drumming up alternatives to at least reduce the bill.  “AI training, GPT training will become a very important cloud service going forward,” said Spectro Cloud CEO Tenry Fu.“But after training, a company will be able to get their model back for real AI application” and the dependence on the cloud giants will hopefully be reduced, he added.  Regulators are hoping that they can keep up, and not leave the giants in charge, imposing their terms on smaller companies.  But it might be too late, at least when it comes to which companies have the means to provide the groundwork of generative AI.  “It is absolutely true that the number of companies that can train the true frontier models is going to be small just because of the resources required,” Altman told the panel last week.  “And so I think there needs to be incredible scrutiny on us and our competitors,” he added.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmh1cnJpeWV0ZGFpbHluZXdzLmNvbS9oaWdoLWNvc3RzLWNhc3Qtc2hhZG93LW92ZXItY2hhdGdwdC1yZXZvbHV0aW9uLTE4MzMwNtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"explosion","2023-04-18","Not Discerned","{""Pittsburgh"", ""Pennsylvania"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T21:27:00","We all know fit is vital for players once they enter the NFL. Not just quarterbacks. From scheme to type of teammates, environment is often the imperceptible element that makes or breaks a young player as he's acclimating to the league.  Let's pinpoint the absolute best fits from the 2023 NFL Draft.  If you're going to play corner in Wink Martindale's system, you're going to need to be comfortable covering on an island in press man. Over the past few seasons, as the Ravens and Giants defensive coordinator, Martindale has been the league's most blitz-happy play-caller, and with that comes a need for suffocating man-to-man ability in the secondary.  That's precisely where Banks thrives. At 6-foot and right around 200 pounds with quality albeit unspectacular length, ridiculous explosion and clear-to-see natural mirroring skills, Banks was born to play on the perimeter in Martindale's system.  Benton is an ultra-physical, stunningly explosive nose tackle with an assertive play style and powerful hands. A three-down defender who's just as apt to crumble the pocket on third down as he is to blow up a run play behind the line, Benton feels like a classic Steelers interior defensive lineman who's going to bring it every snap he's on the field.  From size and athleticism angles, Benton's almost identical to former Dolphins first-round pick Christian Wilkins, and that's the type of hyper-active, pesky defensive tackle who will thrive next to Cam Heyward and across from T.J. Watt and Alex Highsmith in Pittsburgh.  The Bills -- and head coach Sean McDermott -- adore themselves some fast, explosive linebackers. Size be damned. Sure, in 2018, GM Brandon Beane ascended the board to pick the gargantuan Tremaine Edmunds after Josh Allen was selected. Since then, the team has had no issue picking smaller second-level defenders if they explode to the football and are plus coverage players.  That precisely describes Williams, the former Tulane star. A hair under 6-1 and 228 pounds, he's almost exactly the same size as Buffalo's All-Pro linebacker Matt Milano, and he clocked a 4.49 in his 40-yard dash at the combine, which placed in the 94th percentile among linebackers since 1999. He also had 13 pass breakups and two interceptions in his final three seasons for the Green Wave. He's very adept at understanding where he needs to be to follow route combinations and demonstrated awesome awareness when the football was arriving, an advanced skill many linebacker prospects simply do not possess when they enter the NFL.  There's so much DeMarcus Lawrence to Fehoko's on-field profile. Fehoko is actually a bit bigger and plays with better hand work than Lawrence did when he entered the league. In terms of non-stop hustle and outstanding conditioning, the two edge rushers are extremely comparable.  Micah Parsons has become the alpha rusher in Dallas, obviously. Lawrence still lingers as a wily veteran. And the club picked the uber-talented Sam Williams in the second round last year. Fehoko, just like Lawrence did, has the advanced pass-rushing repertoire to outplay his draft position. He registered 153 pressures across 958 pass-rushing snaps in his final three seasons at San Jose State. It's incredibly challenging to maintain such efficiency with that much volume. Fehoko did it. Glorious fit in Dan Quinn's system that prioritizes the front four getting pressure without having to blitz too often.  In the Brian Gutekunst era for the Packers, the organization has emphasized legitimate versatility with their edge rushers, from the signing of Preston Smith and Za'Darius Smith to the utilization of Dean Lowry up and down the line of scrimmage. Brooks is the next in line. I'm not even sure if he should primarily rush from the inside or get after the quarterback from a two-point stance on the edge of the opposing offensive line. He's equally good at both. That's for Green Bay to decide.  While Brooks did not test particularly well for either spot, he looked extraordinarily light-footed on film and generated the most pressures in 2022 among all players who declared for the 2023 draft. How'd he do that? With nasty swim and swipe moves, deceptive bend and high-level hustle to the quarterback.  Michael Onwenu. Joe Thuney. Ted Karras. Shaq Mason. Hjalte Froholdt. Marcus Cannon. Bill Belichick has a knack for discovering quality blockers after the second round in the draft. Sow is next.  A four-year, full-time starter at Eastern Michigan, Sow is ready for any blitz variation or any sized defensive tackle. He's seen it all. At nearly 6-foot-5 and 320-plus pounds with elite athleticism and serious power for the guard spot, he will hit the ground running in the NFL. Frankly, I have no clue why Sow was still available in the fourth round, given the deficit of reliable guard play in the league today.  In their Super Bowl-winning 2022 season, the Chiefs proved the offense was Tyreek Hill proof. Patrick Mahomes had his most efficient campaign as a passer since 2018, when he won MVP. How did Kansas City do it? Scheming and tremendous yards after the catch.  During the regular season, the Chiefs accumulated the most yards after the catch in the NFL (2,850 yards) with the third-most yards after the catch per reception (6.55). Where does Rice truly thrive? Yes, you guessed it. With the ball in his hands, after the catch. In his final two seasons at SMU, Rice forced 35 missed tackles on 160 receptions. Enormous elusiveness rate there. His size and athleticism profiles were spitting images of Brandon Aiyuk. That's who Rice can be in this Patrick Mahomes-powered offense.  3. Christian Gonzalez, CB, Patriots  Like Banks with the Giants, Gonzalez's game is tailor-made to slot into the No. 1 cornerback spot in Belichick's defense. Nearly 6-foot-2 and 200 pounds with 4.38 speed, a 41.5-inch vertical and smooth lateral mobility, there won't be many receivers who can simply ""out-athletic"" Gonzalez in genuine one-on-one situations.  After losing J.C. Jackson in free agency last offseason, New England has needed to reinstall that true alpha corner to the defense. Belichick got one in Gonzalez, who mirrors like a five-year NFL veteran.  2. Devon Achane, RB, Dolphins  In your mind, if you want to flip No. 1 and No. 2 here, I'm cool with it. Both are extraordinary fits from every perceivable angle. Achane is who Mike McDaniel would create in Madden for his offense. Feisty, one-cut type and, of course, most importantly, stupidly fast. Achane's 4.32 tied for the fifth-fastest 40-yard dash time for a running back in the officially recorded combine era (dating back to 1999). He isn't a super-nifty side-to-side back nor is he a bulldozer through traffic. He's experienced finding holes on inside runs before slamming on the accelerators. Despite his small size and speed reputation, Achane was the bellcow at Texas A&M over the past two seasons, with 326 carries, many of which came between the tackles.  I really wrestled with the top two picks here, but I'll go with the quarterback at the top spot simply due to positional value. Richardson's coach, Shane Steichen, was integral to Jalen Hurts' development in Philadelphia. That was well documented during the pre-draft process. Let's not forget Steichen was the Chargers' offensive coordinator during Justin Herbert's epic rookie season in 2022. And really, there's a case to be made that Richardson is a mix of Hurts and Herbert in terms of his overall capabilities at the quarterback position.

"explosion","2023-07-24","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T16:36:05","Supernovae are brilliant explosions that can, for a time, outshine an entire galaxy. They come in two broad types: Type I and Type II. Type II supernovae are what are known as core-collapse supernovae. They occur when a massive dying star fuses ever heavier elements in its core until it runs out of energy options and its core collapses under its own weight, which triggers the explosion. Type I supernovae occur when…well, it’s complicated. But we’re learning more thanks to a new observation by radio astronomers.  The original distinction between the types was that hydrogen emission lines could be seen in Type II events, but not Type I. From this, it was thought that Type I was likely involved a cataclysmic explosion of white dwarfs since white dwarfs don’t contain much hydrogen. Over time astronomers that a subgroup of Type I supernovae contained emission lines of ionized silicon during their maximum brightness, and these became known as Type Ia.  You’ve likely heard of Type Ia supernovae because they have a very useful property. They all tend to explode with about the same maximum brightness. This means by observing its maximum apparent brightness, you can determine how far away it is. In astronomy, we call them standard candles, and they play a crucial role in cosmology. The discovery of cosmic expansion and dark energy is due to observations of Type Ia supernovae.  How type Ia supernova likely occur. Credit: NASA, ESA and A. Feild (STScI)  They likely occur when a white dwarf has a close stellar companion. As the companion star ages and starts to expand, gas from the star is captured by the white dwarf. This continues until the white dwarf captures too much matter to sustain its own weight, reaching a mass of about 1.4 Suns. At that point the white dwarf collapses, triggering the explosion. Because the critical mass, known as the Chandrasekhar limit, is always the same, these supernovae have similar brightness.  But since Type Ia depend on the accretion of matter onto a white dwarf, they aren’t quite all the same. A few Type Ia are much brighter than usual, with strong iron absorption lines, and there is a variant known as Type Iax, where the white dwarf might not be completely destroyed. So we still aren’t entirely sure how these supernovae are triggered, which is why a recent study is so important.  The study was just published in Nature, and it describes the first radio observation of a Type Ia supernova. Supernova types are identified by their spectral lines in optical and infrared. Radio observations of Type II supernovae have helped astronomers understand how very large stars end their lives. But we haven’t had radio observations of white dwarf explosions, since they aren’t bright at radio wavelengths.  Then in 2020, the Zwicky Transient Facility Camera at Palomar Observatory captured a supernova named SN 2020eyj. It was unusual because the spectra observations showed the supernova was surrounded by gas rich in helium. Ionized helium emits radio light, so the team observed the supernova at radio wavelengths, and sure enough, observed the event.  This is important because it gives an astronomer a better understanding of the environment leading up to the supernova explosion. In this case, the companion star likely lost most of its mass before the explosion. Some of its material was captured by the white dwarf, but much of it expanded around the stars, creating a helium-rich environment.  With future radio observations, astronomers could understand why Type Ia supernovae come in several variants. This could also help refine their use as standard candles.

"explosion","2019-07-24","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T09:00:00","Humanity has marveled at the vivid star Betelgeuse for many millennia. Over two thousand years ago, this imperious red object in the constellation Orion caught the eye(opens in a new tab) of the Roman poet Horace:  But see, with what a troubled glare Orion's star is setting there!  Today the colossal, easy-to-find star — so large that it would reach to Jupiter in our solar system — continues to intrigue us. And unlike most stars, we can see it changing, in part because it's relatively nearby in our galaxy. Betelgeuse is known for being a type of ""variable star,"" meaning its brightness fluctuates, at times dramatically, as it inches toward an eventual grandiose collapse and stellar explosion, known as a supernova. Lately, the star has grown noticeably brighter(opens in a new tab).  ""People love Betelgeuse,"" Heidi Morris, a scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory and the president of Pajarito Astronomers, an astronomy club, told Mashable. ""It's been doing these brightness fluctuations for a very long time.""  Yet lately these fluctuations haven't been normal. Typically, Betelgeuse varies in brightness over 400 day cycles. But since violently blowing off a hunk of its atmosphere in 2019(opens in a new tab), these oscillating periods have shortened.  Don't get too excited. This almost certainly isn't evidence of a bloated star on the literal brink of a supernova.  ""People love Betelgeuse.""  Still, Betelgeuse is a red supergiant star that has lived hard and will die young. It's just some 10 million years old — while the sun is 5 billion years old. It's a colossal star in the final stages of its fast-paced evolution. When it inevitably runs out of fuel, the core will collapse under the weight of its immense mass, and create an explosion that can outshine galaxies. It will happen. But you, me, and everyone else would like to know when.  When will Betelgeuse explode?  The cold, hard truth is, it's unknown when Betelgeuse, at some 640 light-years away(opens in a new tab), will collapse into a supernova.  ""We don't have a way of predicting when stars will explode,"" Or Graur, an associate professor of astronomy at the University of Portsmouth who researches supernovae, told Mashable. ""We have no idea when Betelgeuse will explode,"" added Graur, who wrote the book Supernova(opens in a new tab).  ""It really is uncertain,"" agreed Los Alamos' Morris. ""We haven't had a lot of supernovae to study in human history.""  After the mass ejection of part of Betelgeuse's atmosphere in 2019, the graph below shows its expected fluctuations in brightness (green line) versus observations (red) showing an increased rate of change. Credit: NASA / ESA / Elizabeth Wheatley (STScI)  There is some evidence that Betelgeuse might not explode for a long, long time. Historical records indicate Betelgeuse has become redder over the past two thousand years, explained Jason Ybarra, the director of the West Virginia University Planetarium and Observatory, who researches stars and the history of astronomy. That would mean Betelgeuse only evolved into a red supergiant relatively recently (in cosmic terms), so it might take quite a while for the star to completely exhaust its fuel.  ""To answer the question the best I can, Betelgeuse is probably not going to supernova any time soon,"" Ybarra told Mashable.  Once a star becomes a red giant, it has a lot of cooking to do. Under the immense pressure in its core, heat fuses helium into carbon. After thousands of years, it then fuses carbon and helium to create oxygen, and the forging process continues, ultimately creating metals like iron. Right now, Betelgeuse is probably at an earlier stage in this cooking process, explained Morris, as the analysis of chemicals in the star's atmosphere suggests it's fusing helium to carbon in its core. (We can't see inside mighty Betelgeuse.)  NASA has recently written that Betelgeuse won't explode for ""another 100,000 years.""(opens in a new tab) Indeed, this could happen. But that's far from certain. More observations might suggest the star could defy these expectations. Before 1987, for example, astronomers thought only red supergiants(opens in a new tab) could blast into a supernova. But in 1987, a giant blue star in another galaxy exploded(opens in a new tab).  We clearly still have a lot to learn. We might be surprised. Watching Betelgeuse, and other giant stars, will give us a better answer.  ""I would hesitate to say it will do nothing in 10,000 years,"" said Morris. ""We should keep our eye on it and let it inspire us to move forward scientifically.""

Credit: ESO / L. Calçada  What will we see when Betelgeuse explodes?  When Betelgeuse eventually explodes, it will astonish the world, or whomever is watching.  You'd be able to see the star change with the naked eye. Betelgeuse will get progressively brighter at night. After a few days, it will peak in brightness. This will last for around 100 days.  ""It will be the brightest star,"" explained Graur. ""You would even be able to see it by day."" Research predicts(opens in a new tab) the Betelgeuse supernova would be 15 to 250 times brighter than Venus, currently the second-brightest object in the night sky. Then it will begin to fade over hundreds of days, until it winks away into the black ether (binoculars and telescopes will be able to spy it for longer).  But Betelgeuse isn't the only red supergiant in our galaxy. Others, like Eta Carinae(opens in a new tab), might erupt in the sky first. In a galaxy the size of the Milky Way, statistically there should be a supernova every 50 or so years, explained Graur. But we haven't seen one actually happen in 400 years, though we've observed remnants of explosions.  ""Statistically, we're overdo,"" Graur noted.  ""Statistically, we're overdo.""  Any explosive event likely won't be sudden, like detonating a bomb. There could be signals, such as smaller eruptions before the grand finale.  Keep your eyes to the sky. ""We don't know where the next supernova will come from,"" said Graur.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vbWFzaGFibGUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvYmV0ZWxnZXVzZS1zdXBlcm5vdmEtd2hlbi1leHBsb2Rl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

As per the reports, the deceased, who has been identified as Naara Koda (14), a resident of Banglasai tola of Rengrahatu, had gone to the nearby forest to pluck tendu patta leaves. He accidentally stepped over the IED planted by the Maoist and got killed.  Learning about the incidents, personnel from CRPF and district police immediately rushed to the spot and recovered the body, which was later sent out for a post-mortem in Chaibasa’s Sadar hospital.  Briefing about the incident, Sub Inspector Upendra Kumar said that the boy Naara Koda had gone to the Rolabrupi Jengagada forest area to collect tendu patta and Chiraunda when he accidentally stepped over an IED planted by the Maoist and died on the spot.  It’s been reported that the Maoist planted the IEDs to harm the search parties of security forces in the region. It is to be noted that civilians causality due to IEDs planted by the Maoists is almost a regular phenomenon in the region, as a number of villagers have already been killed in the IED explosions planted by the Ultras.  Earlier, in a similar incident in April, an elderly man identified as Jaina Koda, a resident of Regrahattu, was killed in a similar blast triggered by the Maoist in the Regarhattu region under Tonto police station limits. It was learnt that the blast occurred when Koda, along with his son, had gone to the nearby forest area to collect forest produce.  In another similar kind of incident, a 60-year-old woman was also got killed in an IED blast triggered by the Maoist in the forest of Jamargadha under Goilakora police station limits of West Singhbhum district in Jharkhand on April 28.  The incident occurred around 7 am when the deceased woman was collecting Tendu Patta leaves in the nearby forest when she accidentally stepped over a pressure IED planted by the Ultras and died on the spot. The deceased was later identified as Gangi Surin, a resident of Patahatu Toga village under Goilkora police station limits. It was then reported that the woman was accompanied by two other women who merely escaped the deadly explosion.  It should be noted that the security forces have launched a massive anti-naxal operation in the erstwhile Maoist-dominated Kolhan region of the district since January, though once considered to be a Maoist hotbed, the region is reported to be covered with the IEDs planted by the Maoist. It’s been reported that at least seven people, including civilians, have so far lost their lives, while a dozen have been injured in different incidents of IED explosions since the launch of the major counter-insurgency offensive in the region.  Let us tell u that pressure IEDs have frequently been used by the Maoist to harm the search operation party’s in the Maoist affected forests regions which on a number of times led to the death of security personnels as well as the locals visiting the forest to collect forest produce.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vb3JnYW5pc2VyLm9yZy8yMDIzLzA1LzIwLzE3NDkwMS9iaGFyYXQvamhhcmtoYW5kLW1pbm9yLWJveS1raWxsZWQtaW4taWVkLWV4cGxvc2lvbi1wYWxudGVkLWJ5LW1hb2lzdC1pbi1jaGFpYmFzYS_SAX1odHRwczovL29yZ2FuaXNlci5vcmcvMjAyMy8wNS8yMC8xNzQ5MDEvYmhhcmF0L2poYXJraGFuZC1taW5vci1ib3kta2lsbGVkLWluLWllZC1leHBsb3Npb24tcGFsbnRlZC1ieS1tYW9pc3QtaW4tY2hhaWJhc2EvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Our free email updates are the best way to get headlines direct to your inbox  Exploding cars may be entertaining to watch in action films. But cars erupting into fireballs when they crash or tumble down a mountainside is one of the most common and scientifically preposterous movie tropes.  With the release of Fast X, the latest in the Fast & Furious franchise, it’s time to debunk the myth of the exploding car.  Cars never explode under these circumstances and rarely catch fire. That’s unless you were unfortunate enough to be driving a Ford Pinto or Chevrolet Malibu in the 1970s. Both manufacturers cut corners in the production process and the result was poorly designed fuel tanks that were vulnerable to catching alight, often trapping the occupants inside.  Even when racing driver Romain Grosjean crashed at 140mph at the 2020 Bahrain Grand Prix, his vehicle caught fire but did not explode.  Petrol vapour is only explosive in air (which is 20% oxygen ) and when under pressure. Liquid petrol isn’t explosive but the vapour can catch fire. Vapour can escape from the fuel tank when you unscrew the cap. But tanks have a system in which the pressure is relieved without venting the vapour. A full fuel tank is safer than you might think since there is no air inside it and so no oxygen.  In fact, liquid petrol can be difficult to ignite even when it comes into contact with a flame.  What an explosion needs  Explosions are normally caused by a reaction where one or more solids or liquids react and produce a corresponding amount of gas.  A gas occupies much more space ( 800 times the volume of liquid or solid ) than the equivalent amount of solid or liquid. The force generated by the rapidly expanding gas creates the explosion.  Shrapnel is added to explosive weapons of war, which is propelled by the expanding gas.  Petrol doesn’t detonate on its own, but explodes with oxygen when it is in its gas form, is hot enough (about 257℃) and in the presence of a flame or spark.  Imagine watching someone on a hot day filling their car. Often you see a shimmering effect near the tank filler. This is petrol vapour. The “no smoking” instruction on petrol stations signage and painted on oil tankers is about eliminating one of the three requirements for petrol to catch fire.  Petrol is a high energy compound. These compounds release a lot of energy when they react with other substances. When petrol comes into contact with oxygen and burns, it produces low energy compounds (water and CO₂). The difference in energy between those compounds is seen and heard as sound, heat and light and expansive force.  In order for petrol to explode (rather than just burn) it needs to be under pressure, in the gas form, and have enough oxygen and a source of external energy such as a spark or flame to start the reaction.  Exploding cars  In a car engine, the explosion takes place in a cylinder. The piston compresses the air/petrol mixture to create the high-pressure conditions needed for an explosion. When a gas is compressed, it gets hot. That’s why the tip of a bicycle pump gets hot when you pump your tyres up. As the piston compresses the air/fuel mixture, the pressure and temperature rises.  The spark plug provides the small amount of energy required to make the reaction happen. This process happens several thousand times per minute in car engines.  Petrol and diesel can only explode when under pressure and mixed with air and in the case of petrol, have a small amount of energy added in the form of a spark or a flame. Engines pressurise the fuel/air mixture in the cylinder and so produce small, confined explosions which turn a crankshaft and drive the wheels.  Diesel is less flammable. Diesel engines use a higher boiling point fuel which spontaneously combusts under pressure, which is why diesel engines don’t need spark plugs. Diesel engines also cycle at a lower rate compared to petrol engines, which is why they last longer and offer greater fuel economy.  When cars are involved in collisions, fuel lines are often torn and petrol leaks out onto a hot engine. Liquid petrol can catch fire in the presence of air. But it can’t explode because it’s not under pressure and is in the liquid phase rather than a vapour.  In a car crash, diesel or petrol may occasionally catch fire, but there is no mechanism for creating the high pressures required for them to explode, so they don’t.

"explosion","2023-05-01","Not Discerned","{""West"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T06:02:22","Mayor Tim Keller’s father turned him on to pickleball, that oddly-named game that has been described as a combination of tennis, badminton and ping-pong.  “It is so accessible and easy to learn,” the mayor said. “You can learn it in five minutes – especially if you have ever played any racket sport. Even ping-pong. I grew up playing racquetball with my dad.”  The short learning curve is one reason pickleball, which can trace its origins back to 1965, is the fastest growing sport in America and also, according to Keller, Albuquerque.  But there’s more to it than that. It can be played by people well into their senior years.  “My dad is over 80 and plays three days a week,” Keller said. He said pickleball is easier on knees and shoulders than games such as tennis, racquetball and handball.  The mayor also noted that pickleball is well suited to Albuquerque’s weather.  “We have all this sunshine here,” he said. “If it rains, it only lasts five minutes.”  For all those reasons, the city announced recently it has projects in the works that will eventually add 48 pickleball courts to the 100-plus now available on city properties.  “What we are doing is making sure there is a pickleball close to everyone in Albuquerque,” Keller said. “Residents of all ages will soon have expanded opportunity to participate in this popular sport that promotes a healthy lifestyle.”  Some of the new courts, like some of the ones already in existence, will be dual-use courts, striped for both tennis and pickleball. A pickleball court is the same size as a doubles badminton court. Four pickleball courts will fit in one tennis court.  The first of the expansion projects will add 15 pickleball courts, lighting, shade and a restroom to the Manzano Mesa Pickleball Complex, 501 Elizabeth St. SE. There are currently 18 pickleball courts, six of them lighted, at Manzano Mesa now. This project, which went out to bid last month, has an estimated cost of $3.5 million and is projected to start this fall.  Another major project will add eight dedicated pickleball courts, lighting, shade structures and a program building to Ventana Ranch Park, 10000 Universe Blvd. NW. That $1.5 million project is expected to get started later this year.  Pickleball courts will also be cropping up in at facilities that are being constructed, or undergoing renovation, or are slated for expansion.  All of this sounds good to Larry Lite, an Albuquerque pickleball enthusiast and advocate for additional pickleball facilities.  Lite said he and his wife and about 14 others got involved in pickleball in Albuquerque in 2009. He is a member of the ABQ Pickleball Club and the nonprofit New Mexico-Arizona Pickleball Association. The latter gives out grants to schools and first responders to pay for pickleball equipment.  “What makes pickleball unique is that you can have kids from 6 or 7 up to people in their 90s playing and playing together,” he said. “So families can play. The other thing is that when you make mistakes, you laugh about it. When you play recreational pickleball it is a lot of fun.”  Lite, 74, says he plays pickleball four or five times a week.  Mayor Keller, on the other hand, says he has only played the game about five times, most of those times with his father.  But earlier this month, the mayor and Dave Simon, the city Parks and Recreation director, engaged in a game aimed at aiding Dean Matt, a man traveling across the country in an effort to set a world record of 48 pickleball games played in 48 states in less than 48 days.  The game took place at the Manzano Mesa pickleball courts. Keller said he teamed up with Matt, thinking that would give him an edge.  “But it turns out (Matt) had only being playing for a year,” the mayor said. “He was not a ringer. Dave Simon got the best pickleball player in Albuquerque (John “Juan” David). They destroyed us.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFicWpvdXJuYWwuY29tLzI2MDAzNjEvYXMtcGlja2xlYmFsbHMtcG9wdWxhcml0eS1jb250aW51ZXMtdG8tZXhwbG9kZS1hYnEtcGxhbnMtdG8tZXhwYW5kLXRoLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

By the looks of it, the token won’t bounce back into explosive action anytime soon. That doesn’t mean the meme coin space is short of action.  According to top crypto traders, Copium will lead the meme coin mania in the second half of May. It launched on 18th, Thursday, on Uniswap after an invitation-only presale.  Within minutes of going live, Copium generated a $10M million market cap and went 1000% up the charts, revealing its massive community strength on Dextools. The momentum is rapidly growing as more investors flock to Uniswap.  $COPIUM Uniswap V3 pool info, 18 May 2023  The Copium Community & Blue-Tick Influencer Network Catalyze the Meme Coin Mania  Humor, FOMO, and camaraderie are the main ingredients of the Copium bull run. The first-of-its-kind meme cryptocurrency is built around the concept of “coping” with missed opportunities.  Copium’s unique marketing strategy is one of the key drivers of its ongoing bull run. It focuses on building a community of believers in its vision, rather than mere investors.  Within a few days of launch, the Twitter community has grown to 15.6K members. The high engagement on the posts confirms the authenticity of the community. The social media posts take inspiration from popular memes and trends. They are aggressively designed to capture the meme coin audience.  But there are more factors at play that will give momentum to community-building. To begin with, Copium’s invitation-only presale has been used as a strategic measure to onboard influential supporters in the crypto landscape early on. As fervent ambassadors of the project with skin in the game, they are committed to its growth. They will promote its unique value proposition in the wider crypto community.  You guys followed me on genwealth, many did not buy, i held all the way to 30mil mc, still holding, many are now coping. The next one i'm gonna HODL like a chad is copium 🤣 https://t.co/SgHdQxqQnJ — Tsubasa (@0x8i11i0n) May 18, 2023  $COPIUM’s goal is to create a unique, engaging, and sustainable meme cryptocurrency. It unlocks “the power of humor, community, and innovative tokenomics to deliver significant financial gains to its holders”. This is achieved through a unique blend of exclusive NFT rewards, well-designed incentives, and passionate community activities.  Buy Copium Token  An Invitation-Only Presale Set the Stage for the Meme Coin Launch  In a unique approach, Copium incorporated an invitation-only presale, or private sale, into its project launch. It was limited to 200 investors, each of whom was allowed a maximum stake of 1 ETH worth of $COPIUM. The purchase cap established a level playing field and shared accountability for the project’s success.  To ensure that the token is not a fleeting sensation like the many meme coins and shitcoins we have seen in the past, Copium follows a strategically-designed anti-dumping plan.  For example, 10% of the presale tokens are unlocked right off the bat, while the remaining 90% of tokens will gradually unlock linearly over a period of 3 weeks. The investing structure prevents presale buyers from dumping the tokens and inciting a significant price drop.  COPIUM trades, source: DEXtools  Moreover, the project compels investors to hold and increase their $COPIUM holdings. It has launched a unique NFT drop that operates across three stages to reward top $COPIUM holders. You need to rank among the top-200 $COPIUM holders (snapshot taken two hours post-launch) to be eligible for the airdrop. Selected holders will get an NFT that features Copium Tank plus an airdrop of $COPIUM tokens in the first stage.  The more $COPIUM they own, the higher their Copium tank will be filled in the next two weeks. In the third stage, they will be able to claim their airdrop, which correlates to the fullness of their Copium tank.  Experienced developers and OGs in the meme coin space makes the Copium team.  How to Cash in on the Copium Explosion?  With a unique project and delivery, the Copium token is predicted to catalyze the next big meme coin explosion in the next two days. To take advantage of the momentum that is rapidly building up, make sure you grab your tokens early at low prices from Uniswap.  You will need a Metamask or any other wallet of your choice to get started. Once you have it ready, go to app.uniswap.org and connect your wallet. Enter the token address on Uniswap and select $COPIUM.  Check the price of the token and make sure your wallet is stocked up with enough funds before proceeding with the purchase. The token has zero taxes. So, you need not worry about slippage in the early stages. Confirm and sign the transaction, and that’s it.  Copium’s unique vision gives it the potential to enter the top-3 meme coin chart toward the end of this month, dethroning Pepe.  Buy Copium Token  Disclaimer: This is a paid release.

LAKE ELSINORE, Calif.

Friday night's game was postponed as well due to the explosion.  The burst gas line caused a fire that was quickly doused by sprinklers inside the clubhouse, Maggie De La Rosa, a spokeswoman for the Riverside County Fire Department, told the Los Angeles Times.  The blast occurred about 4:20 p.m. Friday, according to the Riverside County Fire Department.  The agency said multiple engine crews and other units were sent to the location and found the two victims suffering from moderate burns to different parts of their bodies.  Plumbers were installing a dryer in the locker room when an ignition occurred,'' Southern California Gas Co. spokesman Ahmad Solomon wrote in an email to The Times.  Firefighters initially requested a helicopter to transport the patients but decided it would be faster to send them by ambulance to nearby Inland Valley Medical Center in Wildomar for treatment.

And on Friday, demonstrators gathered in Martinez to make sure the issue is not forgotten, saying the officers involved in the scandal need to be fired.  Several of the officers are already on leave pending an external investigation, but for community organizers like Shagoofa Khan, who was referenced by officers in the text messages, suspension isn’t enough.  “The community of Antioch do not want those officers who were involved in those text messages ever patrolling the city of Antioch or anywhere ever again,” said Khan.  Plaintiffs in a federal lawsuit against the city of Antioch were also there. Their lawyer, John Burris, says it’s important not to let anyone sweep the topic under the rug.

He’s calling on the chief to do two things. First, decommission a military-style vehicle owned by the police department.  “It was designed for the war in Iraq, specifically against IED explosions, attacks,” said Thorpe. “I don’t know when’s the last time we had an IED explosion or attack in the city of Antioch, so we just don't need that.""  He also wants to bar elected members of the police union from serving on the police department’s internal affairs team.  “The police union is there to defend their members, which is fine, but more importantly the leadership and so it doesn't make sense to have someone who's going to potentially defend you in some arbitration or whatever, and you investigated them,” said Thorpe.  NBC Bay Area reached out to the police chief for comment but has not heard back.  A formal decision regarding the mayor’s requests will take place at the next city council meeting.  In the meantime, community organizers like Khan will continue demonstrations until changes are made.  “Whether it’s protests, whether it's public comments, whether its other actions, whether it's Q&A with the chief. Because at the end of the day, the chief of police is not doing anything.

A 2.2 magnitude impacted the New York metropolitan area around 1:50 a.m., according to the United States Geological Service.  The tremor struck south of Hastings-on-Hudson, a village in Westchester County about 10 miles north of New York City. There were no initial reports of damage or injuries from the seismic activity.  Residents in New York and New Jersey described the quake's impact as dramatic and noticeable, though it did not cause any damage.  Yonkers, NY, resident Sophia Balaj told ABC News that the quake produced a loud rumble for a few seconds, noticeable enough to prompt all the members of the video call she was on to ask each other if they felt the same shaking.  Englewood, NJ, resident Erica Diggs, a military veteran who completed two deployments to Iraq, compared the feeling of the earthquake to a mortar.  ""What it felt like was a mortar, and what it sounded like was a mortar."" She later added the quake ""gave me flashbacks of being in my trailer when I was in Iraq and the mortars would hit that close.""  White Plains, NY, resident Allison Solin added that her unfamiliarity with earthquakes as a New Yorker led to some panic about the source of the shaking that impacted her home.  ""I was like, 'That's not wind,'"" she told ABC News. ""And then I thought, oh my god, is there a bomb explosion nearby?""  Like Solin, many residents near New York City took to social media early Friday morning to ask if others had felt a similar shake.  Earthquakes near New York City are relatively uncommon, though the occasional tremor has impacted the region.  A 5.8 earthquake struck Virginia in 2011, sending noticeable tremors up the eastern seaboard, including New York City. Another 3.9 magnitude earthquake in 2010 off the coast of Southampton caused similar alarm for residents in New York.

(Saudi Press Agency via AP)  KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed a summit of Arab leaders in Saudi Arabia on Friday before what a senior official said would be a trip to Japan for a meeting with the leaders of the world’s most powerful democracies.  Zelenskyy has in recent months made foreign trips to shore up diplomatic support for Ukraine’s fight against Russia’s full-scale invasion almost 15 months ago and solicit more military support.  He earlier this week returned from a three-day trip to Italy, the Vatican, Germany, France and the United Kingdom.  Ukraine and Russia are squaring up for a major and potentially decisive phase of the war as Kyiv prepares an expected counteroffensive. The conflict has been bogged down in a war of attrition in recent months amid bad weather.  Zelenskyy’s office said he was invited to attend the Arab League summit in Jeddah, where he met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman before holding other bilateral meetings.  They discussed Zelenskyy’s peace plan, the security situation in Ukraine and possible investments in the reconstruction of the country, a presidential statement said. Zelenskyy also invited Prince Mohammed to visit Ukraine.  Zelenskyy urged leaders at the summit to resist Moscow’s influence and consider his peace proposals, which include the withdrawal of the Kremlin’s forces from occupied areas of Ukraine.  “I’m more than sure that none of you will agree to surrender a third of your country to the invaders,” Zelenskyy said in English.  “Another priority is the protection of the Muslim community of Ukraine,” Zelenskyy said. “Crimea was the first to suffer from the Russian occupation, and most of those who suffer repression in occupied Crimea are Muslims.”  Crimean Tatar leader Mustafa Dzhemilev accompanied Zelenskyy on the visit.  Zelenskyy will later travel to a Group of Seven summit in Japan, where leaders of the world’s most powerful democracies aim to step up punishment on Russia for its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, according to Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council.  However, Danilov’s office later posted a statement backtracking on his announcement and saying Zelenskyy would appear at the G-7 summit via video. Zelenskyy’s movements are kept secret for security reasons.  Meanwhile, Russian forces kept up their long-range bombardment of Ukrainian targets while drones reportedly damaged train lines behind their front line.  About 130 meters (430 feet) of railway track were damaged and trains were halted for hours after an explosion derailed eight cars of a freight train carrying grain in Russia-occupied Crimea, Russian state media reported Friday.  Thursday’s blast prompted renewed suspicions about possible Ukrainian saboteur activity behind Russian lines.  Train traffic was also halted in northern Crimea on Thursday night after a drone hit a railway track near the town of Dzhankoi, Russia’s Baza Telegram channel reported.  Sergei Aksyonov, the Kremlin-appointed head of Crimea, said in a separate post that four Ukrainian drones were shot down overnight in the peninsula’s north. Aksyonov claimed there was no damage or casualties.  Russia overnight fired cruise missiles, drones and artillery at targets across Ukraine, killing two civilians, officials said Friday.  The attacks included an air assault on Kyiv for the second straight day and the 10th time in three weeks. The Kremlin’s forces also took aim at central, eastern and southern Ukraine, and the western Lviv region near the border with Poland.  Russia launched 22 Iranian-made Shahed drones and six Kalibr cruise missiles during the night, the Ukrainian Air Force said. It said air defenses downed 16 drones and three missiles.  The Russian shelling killed two civilians and wounded nine others in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, said its governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko.  The missile attacks that have intensified recently aim to “disrupt Ukraine’s plans and preparations for active military operations during the spring-summer campaign,” according to a statement from Ukraine’s intelligence agency, published on Telegram.  The targets are Ukraine’s military control points and barracks, supply routes and the places where ammunition, equipment, fuel are stored, it said.  On Friday, the United Nations said operations to ship Ukrainian grain were “partially restarting,” two days after Russia gave a green light to extend the deal for two months. The U.N. also urged a swift return to the previous tempo of ship arrivals and departures from all three Black Sea ports and inspections of their cargo.  U.N. associate spokesperson Stephanie Tremblay said the Joint Coordination Center, which includes representatives from the four parties involved in the deal – Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the United Nations -- approved the registration Friday of six new vessels to participate in the grain shipments. Nine applications to participate remain pending, she said.  No ships are currently loading at any of the three ports, Tremblay said, but inspection teams from the center checked and cleared three new vessels Friday to proceed to the ports of Odesa and Chornomorsk.  ___  Hanna Arhirova in Kyiv and Edith M.

A storage site for conventional weapons near the city, in western Ukraine, was hit by Russian missiles on May 13, causing large explosions. However, Ukraine possesses no nuclear or radiological weapons. Russia has been waging an unprovoked war on Ukraine since February 2022.  Disinformation websites compared the explosion to the Chernobyl power plant tragedy in 1986. There is a nuclear power plant in Khmelnytskyi, but it was not damaged in the Russian strike.  SHMÚ debunked claims of heightened radiation levels on its website. According to its meteorologists, airborne radiation is currently at 115 nSv/h, which is within the standard range of 100-200 nSV/h. SHMÚ writes that the rate can vary – it tends to increase slightly for a short period following heavy rain – but has remained normal all week.  Meteorologists say that they would be able to detect an anomaly or sudden rise in radiation levels within ten minutes, which they could raise immediately with international radiation safety organizations. The Radiation Safety Office of the Public Health Authority added that there have been no increases in radiation concentrations recorded anywhere in Europe.  Both authorities add that people can check the current concentration, potential dangers, and a range of other information at either the Radioactivity Environmental Monitoring website or directly on the SHMÚ website, which is updated hourly.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vc3BlY3RhdG9yLnNtZS5zay9jLzIzMTcxMDA4L3NobXUtZGVidW5rcy1yYWRpYXRpb24taG9heC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Universal always goes to extreme lengths to avoid using CGI, which means that when it comes to Fast and Furious stunts, cars are crashed for real.  Each stunt is planned using computer generated images and it is then filmed in separate parts, before being put together in the edit.  In our latest Xplained video, we broke down the most dangerous and craziest stunt in each movie, starting from Fast Five.  READ MORE: Every Fast and Furious movie ranked from worst to best  Fast Five – Vault Heist scene  Believe it or not, 98 percent of this scene was real.  Different vaults were used for different parts of the scene.  One was a fake vault driven on wheels, while another was a real 4,000 kg (8,818 lbs) vault.  And because they were so heavy, the Dodge Chargers had to be modified with stronger frames and more power.  Xplained Xplained  Andy Gill, Fast Five stunt coordinator, said it was absolutely crucial that all Dodge Chargers were in sync while driving to maintain control over what was going to happen with the vault.  The sad part is, nearly 200 vehicles were totaled for this scene alone.  Fast and Furious 6 – Tank on the highway  The production team used two real Chieftain tanks for the scene.  They also decided to customize the 60-ton tank to make it faster, giving it a top speed of nearly 60 mph (96 km/h).  Xplained / Universal Xplained / Universal  The scene was shot on a deserted highway where Universal built a custom cement ramp to make sure the tank could crash into the truck at an exact angle.  Further, they decided to use real cars, not just shells, to make it look more realistic.  Furious 7 – Airplane jump scene  In order to pull this off, they had to make sure the plane was flying at exactly 12,000 feet and above the designated drop zone.  Red Bull provided three flying cameramen who jumped from the plane with a parachute to film their cars during their descend.  They also used drones and helicopters to film the sequence.  Xplained / Universal Xplained / Universal  Coordinating all cameramen was the hardest part, mostly because when the cars were in the air, it became very difficult to control and predict their movement.  The Fate of the Furious – Frozen lake scene  The race across the lake was shot in Iceland, driving over 42 inches of frozen ice.  The craziest part is, the Lamborghini they used in the scene was real, not a kit car.  Xplained / Universal Xplained / Universal  The car was obviously hopeless on regular tires, so they tried using studded tires.  It was a bit better but still not good enough, so they relied on a clever solution the stunt drivers came up with.  They used winter tires with no studs when they wanted to drift to make the scene look good, and harder studded tires for when they actually needed to move across the lake.  Xplained / Universal  The explosions were real (duh) and at any given moment they’d have up to 16 cars on ice.  So in order to make sure no one would actually fall in, they brought ice engineers to coordinate with stunt drivers, medics and scuba divers trained specifically to dive in these harsh weather conditions.  The submarine was CGI, but the explosion that sent the vehicles 30 feet into the air was real.  F9 – Peligro minas  Xplained / Universal Xplained / Universal  This sequence, shot in Thailand, had more explosions than any other scene.  They dug massive holes in the ground and filled them up with real landmines.  For this shoot, Universal customized a Marauder, a massive go-anywhere off-roader, to make it bulletproof and explosion-proof.  Fast X – Carabinieri chase scene  Xplained  Filmed in Italy, this scene depicts a car chase with the Carabinieri, Italy’s national gendarmerie.  Several cars were used for the sequence, along with a giant rolling ball.  Andy Gill said they built two eight-foot balls, and used overhead wires to control the ball’s movement.  “We had a full steel [ball] that weighed over 1.5 tons, [and] then we had a lightweight one that was 800 pounds,” said Gill.  In the end, they even set the ball on fire, because why not.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vc3VwZXJjYXJibG9uZGllLmNvbS9mYXN0LWFuZC1mdXJpb3VzLXN0dW50cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"explosion","2023-04-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T11:56:09","Events of the past year have convinced more Florida homeowners of the need to carry flood insurance.  Flooding caused by hurricanes Ian and Nicole caught hundreds, if not thousands, of homeowners across the state by surprise, and without flood insurance.  Similarly, many homeowners affected by last month’s historic rainfall in eastern Broward County had no flood insurance and learned tragically that damage caused by water rising from the ground was not covered by their normal homeowner insurance.  It’s not just flood victims who are experiencing hard lessons about flood insurance.  Just as homeowners are realizing the increased risks of going without flood coverage, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has released data showing that coverage costs are exploding for properties in coastal areas most vulnerable to flooding.  The cost hikes stem from mandates by Congress to require rates charged by the National Flood Insurance Program, which is run by FEMA, to reflect the cost of flood risk to individual covered properties, and to pay down the program’s deficit, which was $20.5 million as of last November, according to FEMA.  The result is a new risk pricing model called Risk Rating 2.0, which took effect on Oct. 1, 2021, for new NFIP policies and on April 1, 2022, for renewing policies. Rather than set rates solely based on a property’s elevation within a zone on a Flood Insurance Rate Map, the new approach considers more risk variables such as flood frequency, types of flooding, and distance to a water source, along with individual property characteristics like elevation and the cost to rebuild, FEMA’s website states.  Improved modeling, however, is of little comfort to homeowners who will have to pay more for flood insurance at the same time costs of regular multiperil property insurance are skyrocketing.  Recently, FEMA released a spreadsheet that compared average premiums currently and how high they’ll climb under the new pricing model.  For example, homeowners in Boca Raton’s 33432 ZIP code can look forward to a whopping 229% flood insurance premium increase, from an average $950 per policy to $3,128.  In Broward County, the 33305 ZIP code that includes Wilton Manors and Fort Lauderdale neighborhoods near the Middle River will pay 209% more, from $1,099 to $3,400.  In the 33315 zip code, which includes Fort Lauderdale’s Edgewood neighborhood that was among the hardest-hit by last month’s flooding, average rates will increase by 64% — from $863 currently to $1,420.  These numbers are averages. Within each ZIP code are less expensive homes with cheaper coverage costs and pricier homes that will cost even more to insure.  Unsurprisingly, homes nearest the coast, particularly in low-lying areas, cost far more to insure than homes on higher ground in western suburban cities.  For example, homeowners in Coral Springs’ 33071 ZIP code are looking at a total premium increase of just 17.6% — from $669 to $787.  FEMA says the new pricing model will also drive down the cost of flood insurance for customers with low-risk characteristics. Yet, none of South Florida’s ZIP codes will see average rates decrease, FEMA’s data shows.  Not everyone facing rate increases will have to pay the higher premiums immediately. While homeowners who previously did not carry NFIP flood insurance will have to pay the new higher prices if they want a new policy, price hikes for existing policyholders are capped at 18% a year for homesteaded properties and 25% annually for second homes or investment properties, until they reach the new rates.  If the total increase is 18% or less, affected homeowners will pay it just once — presumably until FEMA raises rates again, whenever that happens.  Few homes have flood insurance, even in Florida  Although Florida has the largest number of NFIP flood insurance policies of any U.S. state — 597,967 of 2.2 million in the U.S., FEMA data shows, the percentage of covered homes remains low.  Florida has 3.8 million detached single-family homes, according to 2020 census figures. The number of FEMA flood insurance policies are just 15.7% of that total. In South Florida’s tricounty region, the percentage is 20.8%.  The actual percentages of homes with flood insurance are likely to be a little different. The above estimates don’t take into account private flood insurance policies, which are increasing but still a fraction of the number of federally-backed policies. And the estimates exclude attached single-family homes, such as townhomes. The percentage also does not include condominiums, which are typically covered by blanket commercial policies.  Experts advise every Florida homeowner to buy flood insurance because flooding can happen throughout the state, as during last fall’s hurricanes.  But many buy flood insurance only when required, such as home loan borrowers with federally backed mortgages who live in high-risk flood zones.  Flood insurance required for some with Citizens insurance  This year, a new set of homeowners are required to buy flood insurance. Customers of state-owned Citizens Property Insurance Corp. who live in high-risk flood zones are required to also carry flood insurance.  That mandate, enacted by the state Legislature and governor last year, took effect on April 1 for new Citizens policyholders and on July 1 for renewing policyholders.  Under the new law, all Citizens policyholders will have to buy flood insurance by 2027.  According to Citizens data, 228,203 of the company’s 1.2 million customers are now required to buy flood insurance. Of them, 105,763 are in Broward, Palm Beach or Miami-Dade counties.  When enacted last year, the law also required condo owners covered by Citizens to buy flood insurance. They were exempted, however, by a new law that was passed during the just-completed spring Legislative session and now awaits the governor’s signature. The change followed complaints that flood insurance is unnecessary for residents on upper floors of multistory buildings and for those covered by commercial policies that cover all units.  Although the mandate remains in place legally, Citizens has stopped sending notices to condo owners telling them they must buy flood insurance at renewal time, Citizens spokesman Michael Peltier said. Once it is signed, condo owners who bought coverage will be able to drop it.  If they bought FEMA coverage, they can request refunds if their policies have not yet taken effect, the NFIP’s website states.  Because the flood insurance requirement for renewing Citizens customers won’t take effect until July 1, Ryan Papy, president of Palmetto Bay-based Keyes Insurance, says it’s still a bit early to gauge the impact.  “There hasn’t been that much sticker shock,” Papy said in an email. “Many (premiums) in Miami-Dade County have gone down.”  But he added, “We do see issues when some clients are purchasing new property.” The difference between a new owner’s premiums and the capped rates paid by the previous owner can sometimes “be extreme,” he said.  Save money on the private market?  Florida homeowners hit hardest by rising NFIP rate hikes might ask their agents to see if they can save money by checking out the private flood insurance market.  Neptune Flood, the nation’s largest private flood insurer with more than 150,000 clients, can save policyholders up to 25% off the cost of comparable NFIP coverage, Neptune spokeswoman Loren Pomerantz said by email.  Private flood insurance satisfies requirements of both federal mortgage guarantors and Citizens, according to Pomerantz and Peltier.  Pomerantz said Neptune’s sales in Florida have increased in recent months. Sales climbed 20% in areas hard hit by Hurricane Ian prior to the new Citizens mandate taking effect. In high-risk flood zones, sales have increased 25% since April 1 compared to the same period last year, she said.  Private flood insurance also offers coverage that far exceeds the NFIP’s $250,000 cap for structural damage and $100,000 limit for personal property damage. “We can cover homes for up to $4 million in building coverage and $500,000 of personal property,” she said. “Additional coverage options not available through the NFIP include pool repair and refill, replacement cost on contents, temporary living expenses and more. This allows a homeowner to adequately cover their property and protect their families in the event of a flood-related loss.”  Ron Hurtibise covers business and consumer issues for the South Florida Sun Sentinel.

"explosion","2023-02-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T14:54:17","Back in business: Yves Bissouma has recovered from ankle surgery for Tottenham (Tottenham Hotspur FC via Getty I)  Ryan Mason says he hopes “explosive” midfielder Yves Bissouma can energise Tottenham's final push for European football next season.  Bissouma returned to the pitch for the first time since February in one of the few positives from a 2-1 defeat at Aston Villa last time out, which dented Spurs' hopes of securing a Europa League or Conference League place.  The Mali international had been missing since undergoing surgery on a fractured ankle but could return to the starting XI for Saturday's penultimate game of the season at home to Brentford.  ""[His return] is a bonus because if we look at this season, we've probably never had all five [midfielders] fit and firing at the same time,"" Mason said of Bissouma.  ""Obviously Yves is back now and we've got Skippy [Oliver Skipp], Pape [Sarr] and Pierre [Hojbjerg] and Rodrigo [Bentancur] is out.  ""Ideally you have all of them fit and firing and you can really drive that in training. Of course, we signed Yves in the last summer transfer window and we believe in him. He's coming to the stage of the season where he's back and I think he's someone that we hope that in next couple of games, if he's selected, he can bring that energy.  ""Every one of our midfielders has different strengths and probably one of Yves' biggest strengths is his ability to get on the ball and drive. He can be an all-round midfielder. We have good midfielders that can do the same thing but I think he is a explosive player and hopefully he can help us in the next two games.""  Before his injury, Bissouma struggled to make an impact under Antonio Conte, having joined Spurs from Brighton in a £25million summer deal.  ""I think that is quite normal when you come into different style of play and a different system, it can take time,"" Mason added.  ""We see it with players that come from abroad to the Premier League, they have to adjust, and the same goes for an English player or someone who has been playing in the Premier League to have to adjust to a new team and a new style of play.  Story continues  ""Obviously he's had a few injuries this season that have probably halted his progress, but there are two games now and I can feel the excitement from him that he's back out on the training pitch and he's out there playing and he feels like he can help the team and hopefully he can do that.""  Mason also said that on-loan defender Clement Lenglet is the ""type of character"" Spurs should want to keep at the club. Spurs do not have an option to make the Frenchman's loan permanent but could negotiate a deal with his parent club, Barcelona.  Mason believes loanee Clement Lenglet is the kind of character Tottenham need at the club (Tottenham Hotspur FC via Getty Images)  ""These conversations I'm sure will happen in the summer,"" Mason said. ""Right now it's not on my mind but I would say about Clem is that he is the type of character we want around the training ground. He is professional, he does it right. He's vocal and the more people we can keep hold of and get in, the more beneficial it is.""  Mason added that he has never had more belief in his work than at present, and hopes the changes he has made since becoming acting coach can translate into results against Brentford and Leeds in the run-in.  ""The most important thing is to get results, that's what we're working for,"" he said. ""At the same time I'd like to start seeing what we believe our team should look like [in the final two games].  ""It's been such a short space of time but we believe and trust in the work we're doing. Inside the players can feel that change and if it can transfer to the outside in the next two games I think it would be an added bonus. But the most important thing, of course, is getting the results.  ""I believe in the way I work, me and my team. I have more belief now than I've ever had in my life that what we're doing, for this football club, the environment, the feeling we're trying to create here. I believe in it so much. That's probably where it [my positivity] is coming from.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vdWsuc3BvcnRzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL3J5YW4tbWFzb24tYmFja3MtZXhwbG9zaXZlLXl2ZXMtMTQyODA1ODAwLmh0bWzSAVdodHRwczovL3VrLnNwb3J0cy55YWhvby5jb20vYW1waHRtbC9uZXdzL3J5YW4tbWFzb24tYmFja3MtZXhwbG9zaXZlLXl2ZXMtMTQyODA1ODAwLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The TomTom founder, 39, had a jaw-dropping confrontation with his now-ex, Ariana Madix, during Wednesday's episode over his illicit affair with Raquel Leviss, which promptly ended their nine-year relationship back in March.  The TV personality was seen stepping out of a vehicle to pump gas wearing a short-sleeved, gray T-shirt and a pair of black jeans.  He slipped into white sneakers and threw on a black cap that represented his bar, TomTom, to partially cover his locks. Sandoval additionally threw on both a beaded necklace and bracelet to complete his overall simplistic look for the day.

At one point, the businessman had asked Madix, 'Do you want anything?' and she emotionally responded with, 'For you to die.'  She then proceeded to tell him, 'I regret every moment that I stood up for you, defended you, supported you. You're worth nothing and I want you to feel that deep in your soul.'  The actress further expressed to Sandoval during the heated conversation, 'I want you to hear those words coming from the mouth of the woman that f***ing stood by you and loved you and was ready to build the rest of my life around you.'  'Hear my words and know that's how I feel about you. I regret ever loving you,' the star angrily added.  During the season finale, Tom had also broken down to Lisa Vanderpump as they held a one-on-one conversation about the cheating scandal.  He stood up from the couch he had been sitting on and strolled over to a window where he began hyperventilating, prompting Lisa to go over and offer comfort. 'You have to stop. It's going to get better from here,' she told him.  The episode cut to Sandoval's confessional where he tearfully stated, 'We did always protect each other.

After he crashed a girls' night, Madix ended up conversing with the star and stated, 'Can I start by saying something to you? If I hear anything about him feeling down and you feeling bad for him, I'm just going to get up and walk away.'  Schwartz quickly responded with, 'I'm not here to advocate for him. I'm p**sed at Sandoval, I feel like he exploited my kindness. 'Also, our business, that we put our hearts and souls into.' Both he and Sandoval helped launch West Hollywood's TomTom bar in 2018.  Ariana questioned, 'Why would somebody want to give their money to that man? 'He f***ed up your [business] family. He didn't give a single flying f**k about your family.'  'What did he think was going to f**kng happen? He was going to cheat on me and walk away unscathed?' she demanded. Tom apologized to Ariana but also explained that he felt he was 'painted as this coconspirator. It's f***ing devastating to me.'  Despite saying sorry, Madix revealed that she 'will not have mutual friends with' her now-ex, Tom Sandoval, and that she was 'not' Schwartz's 'friend anymore.'  His ex-wife, Katie Maloney, had also confronted him earlier in the episode due to his knowledge of the affair.

"explosion","2023-11-01","Not Discerned","{""Tokyo"", ""Tokyo"", ""Japan""}","2023-05-19T20:10:57","This post contains spoilers for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 and Fast X.  The end of Fast X is full of surprises. First off, there’s the revelation that this movie is the first part of a duology (or, if Vin Diesel has his way, a trilogy) that will conclude the Fast & Furious franchise. Fast X ends mid-action with a bomb about to go off and cause a dam to collapse on Diesel’s Dominic Toretto and his son. Before the movie ends, we do get a brief glimpse of Dom’s wife Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), who has spent much of the movie in a CIA black site in Antarctica with Dom’s enemy, Charlize Theron’s Cipher.  The two manage to escape and find (surprise!) Gal Gadot’s Gisele, who supposedly sacrificed her life to protect her boyfriend Han (Sung Kang) in Fast & Furious 6. She emerges from the ice in a high-tech submarine to give Letty and Cipher a lift back to civilization. Gisele waves happily from the hatch but doesn’t say anything. Audiences will have to wait for Fast 11 to find out how, exactly, she survived jumping off an airplane in the sixth movie.  Read More: Breaking Down the Very Complicated Fast & Furious Family Tree  If you’re rolling your eyes at the fact that Gisele is back from the dead, know that in the Fast franchise, everyone is immortal. Diesel and his crew have been at this resurrection business for a long time. Letty was thrown from a car explosion and left for dead in the fourth movie, The Fast and the Furious, but popped back up in the post-credits scene for Fast Five. That return was somewhat plausible—even the soap opera-esque explanation of amnesia felt permissible because the franchise simply wasn’t the same without Rodriguez, one of the most compelling action stars working today.  But each new comeback since has seen diminishing returns. In F9, Han revealed that he somehow survived being stuck inside a car during an explosion at the end of Tokyo Drift. It turns out CIA operative Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) helped Han fake his death. The CIA situation also provided some explanation for why Han stayed away from his friends for so long.  Gal Gadot in Fast & Furious 6. Universal/Everett Collection  But now they’re bringing back Gisele who fell off an airplane. Explaining how someone who isn’t literally Wonder Woman (in this movie, at least) can survive a fall from a moving plane onto a tarmac takes some doing. Did she have a secret parachute? Was there a giant mattress set up on the exact right spot on that endless airport runway? Perhaps more problematic, future films will have to bend over backwards to find a plausible reason for why Gisele has been hanging out in Antarctica working for Dom’s arch nemesis Cipher instead of reuniting with her lost love, Han.  Read More: Let’s Talk About the Shocking Reveals of Fast X’s Final & Mid-Credits Scene  Fast & Furious is far from the only franchise guilty of reviving the deceased. We’ve also seen beloved characters come undead in Guardians of the Galaxy, Justice League, and The Rise of Skywalker. Some explanations are better than others: Lately, they usually involve some sort of resurrection magic or an alternate universe version of a character arriving in our story from a parallel timeline. But the troubling trend in increasingly lackluster franchise films not only deprives the movie of any true stakes, it also deprioritizes compelling—dare we say rational—storytelling in order to serve Hollywood’s multi-film contract negotiations with big-name actors, even if those deals betray their characters’ fates long before we ever see them die, or come back to life, onscreen.  The resurrection trend  Gamora (Zoe Saldana) in Avengers: Infinity War Chuck Zlotnick—Marvel Studios  The Fast folks may be guilty of playing fast and loose with the finality of death. But other franchises have seriously stumbled over these plot points. Few audience members bought that Zack Snyder had actually killed off franchise star Henry Cavill’s Superman in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. The character’s return in Justice League seemed so inevitable and obvious to fans that the studio announced Cavill’s comeback at San Diego Comic-Con months before Justice League’s premiere instead of waiting to spring the surprise on viewers in the theaters.  Then there’s Emperor Palpatine’s return in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, a retcon of one of the most pivotal moments in cinematic history that earned little more than a “yada yada” explanation about how Palpatine was alive again because of power and he was biding his time until the finale of this series to reveal himself because of reasons. The villain’s comeback was designed to link the main character Rey (Daisy Ridley) to the two main families in the larger Star Wars saga, not to serve the actual story.  The most recent and aggravating example may be Gamora’s return to the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise. The character (played by Zoe Saldaña) was pushed off a cliff by her genocidal father Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War, only for a version of her from an earlier timeline to return to the story in Avengers: Endgame. Guardians creator James Gunn didn’t devise these plotlines for Gamora; Avengers creators Joe and Anthony Russo did. That left Gunn in the unenviable position of figuring out what to do with an out-of-time Gamora who does not remember falling in love with his main character Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) or joining the Guardians team.  As a result, Saldaña doesn’t have much to do in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 except repeatedly rebuff Star Lord’s advances. She feels more like an afterthought than a driving force in the story. Saldaña, one of the highlights of the Marvel franchise, may have been better off left for dead.  No stakes and big contracts  Henry Cavill as Superman Clay Enos—DC Comics/Warner Bros.  The most obvious problem with resurrecting the dearly departed members of your cinematic team is that it deprives the movie of stakes. If Superman is invincible, why do we care about his fight with the monster-of-the week? Audiences who become accustomed to these cheats will come to resent the implication that they should allow themselves to fall for the filmmakers’ tricks then come back for more when the next installment hits theaters.  When Dom’s brother Jakob (John Cena) sacrifices himself by driving his car into a fiery explosion in the climactic chase in Fast X, the movie takes barely a moment to mourn the character. After all, he probably survived because he was secretly wearing a flame-retardant suit or rolled out of the car at the last minute or…something. Sure, Jakob may be gone for awhile. Cena is pretty busy with the Peacemaker TV series and nearly a dozen upcoming film projects. But remember, if you don’t see a body and the pay is high enough, the A-list star is probably coming back at some point. (Note that Gadot’s return to the franchise conveniently coincided with Warner Bros. scrapping plans to film Wonder Woman 3.)  Fast & Furious has pulled this trick so many times that it’s more shocking that Dwayne Johnson’s Hobbes, who is very much alive and well in the Fast universe and stars in his own spinoff Hobbes & Shaw, pops up in a Fast X post-credits scene than that Gadot has returned. Johnson and Vin Diesel have not starred in the same film for years, allegedly due to a rumored rift between the two. His return to the main franchise seemed less likely than Gisele clawing her way out of a grave. (Though Johnson and Diesel notably do not share a scene and the cameo may have existed merely to set up some future Hobbes & Shaw movie.)  It’s hard not to think about these deaths and revivals in terms of actor contract negotiations. When fans speculated about who would die and who would survive Avengers: Endgame, they based their answers on actors’ expressed desires to continue on in the franchise or not. Robert Downey Jr. ready to retire Iron Man? Officially dead. Scarlett Johansson’s lawsuit with Disney probably sealed Black Widow’s fate in the Marvel Cinematic Universe: She’s not coming back.  How to do the storyline better  Yahya Abdul-Mateen II in The Matrix Resurrections Murray Close—Warner Bros.  This is not to say that all dead characters should stay dead always. If it serves a narrative purpose in the story, a Christ-like resurrection can be thematically resonant and drive drama. Think: Gandalf leveling up from Gandalf the Gray to Gandalf the White after his death in Lord of the Rings or Neo’s mysterious return in the aptly named Matrix: Resurrections fueling the mystery of the entire film and underlining franchise themes about sacrifice.  Avatar: The Way of Water got particularly inventive when it came to finding ways to recycle actors from the original film in new ways: Sigourney Weaver’s scientist Grace dies in the first film, but the actor returned to play a motion-capture version of a Na’vi teen in the second movie with mysterious circumstances surrounding her birth. Is she Grace resurrected? Is she the daughter of the goddess Eywa? Such questions will no doubt play a major role in the next three Avatar films.  Not all creative solutions work: The return of Steve in Wonder Woman 1984 involved Chris Pine inhabiting another man’s body but still looking like Chris Pine to both Wonder Woman and the audience, a plot device that sent audiences’ heads spinning with questions of how the universe worked and whether it was kind of icky that Wonder Woman was using another dude’s body to resurrect her lover. But at least his return forced our hero to make a difficult choice between personal happiness and the fate of the world.  Those resurrections were at least somewhat earned. What feels increasingly cheap are the characters who pop up in post-credits scenes, their arrivals timed specifically to motivate you to see the next film and find out how they possibly could have survived. In Gisele’s case, I’m betting a car caught her. After all, cars are always defying the laws of physics in the Fast movies, as soft and cushiony a landing pad for hurtling bodies as any mattress.

"explosion","2023-05-13","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T17:40:00","Rafael Devers goes deep twice as the Red Sox lead vs. the Padres.  SAN DIEGO -- — Rafael Devers homered twice and drove in four runs to help the Boston Red Sox beat San Diego 6-1 Friday night to hand the staggering Padres their 10th loss in 12 games.  Devers and his friend and former teammate, Padres shortstop Xander Bogaerts, took the lineup cards out for the pregame exchange and hugged. Devers then circled the bases in front of Bogaerts in consecutive innings in his 14th career multi-homer game.  Devers hit a solo shot to right so hard leading off the second that he stumbled back a few steps before starting his trot. He hit a three-run homer nearly to the base of the batter's eye in straightaway center field with no outs in the five-run third for a 6-0 lead. He has 13 homers this season.  Both came off lefty Blake Snell (1-6), who allowed six runs and five hits in four innings.  Before the game, Bogaerts said he hoped Devers didn't hit any homers because “he's a dangerous guy. He's truly one of a kind.""  Devers proved his friend right.  “Very happy today that I was able to hit two runs but you have to keep doing adjustments every day,” Devers said through a translator.  “He put two great swings,” manager Alex Cora said. “Around him, everybody put up good at-bats. That was impressive, the third inning. We were grinding at-bats, fouling off pitches, staying on pitches, taking our walks. It was a fun inning.”  Rob Refsnyder hit a two-run, bases-loaded double ahead of Devers' three-run shot to help the Red Sox to their third straight win.  Other than Fernando Tatis Jr.'s leadoff homer in the third off James Paxton (1-0), the Padres' offensive struggles continued on a day when slugger Manny Machado went on the 10-day injured list with a hairline fracture in his left hand. The Padres were booed at game's end, just as they were Wednesday after a loss to Kansas City. They fell to five games under .500 and are 8 1/2 games behind the NL West-leading Los Angeles Dodgers and just one game ahead of the last-place Colorado Rockies.  The Padres managed just Tatis' homer, his sixth, and four singles in six innings off Paxton, who was making only his second start of 2023. He made his Red Sox debut a week earlier, his first big league appearance since April 6, 2021, with Seattle. He missed most of the 2020-22 seasons due to injuries and had Tommy John surgery on April 12, 2021.  “It feels great, just really to contribute to the team and be here pitching again,” said Paxton, who earned his first victory since Aug. 15, 2020, against Boston while he was with the New York Yankees.  Paxton said Devers is ""awesome. His swing is amazing. So good on offense and he does a great job at third base, too. Just an all-around fantastic player, fun to watch.”  Josh Winckowski pitched the final three innings for his second save.  Bogaerts, who left the Red Sox as a free agent and signed a $280 million, 11-year contract in December, was robbed of a single by diving right fielder Alex Verdugo to end the fifth.  EXPLOSION IN SINGLE-A CLUBHOUSE  Two contract workers were burned in a natural gas explosion in the home clubhouse of the Lake Elsinore Storm, the Padres' Class-A affiliate, leading to Friday's game being postponed. The two workers were taken to a hospital. The Padres said no players were involved.  DEVERS AND BOGEY  Devers and Bogaerts went out to eat Thursday, an off day for both teams. “You know what's crazy is, I forgot my wallet at home. I'm not even kidding,"" Bogaerts said. He thought he left it at the ballpark but didn't find it there, and started to get nervous. “I said, 'Man, you've got to pick this up. I don't even have a dollar.'"" Bogaerts said he found his wallet at home, in his backpack, where he put it during the bus ride home from Dodger Stadium last Sunday. ”I haven't told him that piece yet but I told him right away that he's got to pay,” Bogaerts said.  TRAINER'S ROOM  Red Sox: 1B Justin Turner, who was aboard for Devers' three-run shot, left the game with left knee soreness.  Padres: Machado's was hurt when he was hit by a pitch Monday night. His IL stint is retroactive to Tuesday. Manager Bob Melvin said there’s a possibility Machado can return when the Padres play at the New York Yankees next weekend.  UP NEXT  Saturday night's game will feature a marquee matchup between Red Sox LHP Chris Sale (3-2, 5.40 ERA) and Padres RHP Joe Musgrove (1-1, 6.63).  ------  AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP--Sports","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY28udWsvbWxiL3JlY2FwL18vZ2FtZUlkLzQwMTQ3MTY5M9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

We are yet to know why this step was taken.  Later in 2021, Buterin burned 90% of his Shiba Inu holdings and donated the rest to charities. He had earlier donated SHIB tokens worth $1 billion to a COVID-19 relief fund for India, CryptoRelief. He said that this was the only way he could avoid his transactions in Shiba Inu being read as actions.  Buterin’s decision to burn his holdings, nearly 50% of the Shiba Inu coins in circulation, effectively put them outside the purview of the market since these coins are now stored on an inaccessible public address. Ryoshi thanked Buterin for his contribution to creating a decentralized financial system.  Buterin has also praised the Shiba Inu community for supporting different initiatives such as the Fellows in AI Existential Safety.  The platform also supports the Shiba Inu Incubator, facilitating a large group of creative digital artists who bring forth an experience of what feels like a decentralized movement. The NFT project gives support to artists in the creation, exhibition, promotion and auction of their artworks, besides providing them with other streams of income.  In August 2022, the Shiba Inu Ecosystem announced on Twitter the name of the Shib CCG game, Shiba Eternity. It also revealed that the game would be available on both Google PlayStore and Apple AppStore. On 17 September, the game was launched in Australia and plans to venture into other countries.  The community is also involved in rescuing real Shiba Inu dogs through its association with the NGO named Shiba Inu Rescue Association.  Skeptics are unsure of the future of cryptocurrency and memecoins in particular. While the mainstream cryptocurrencies projected themselves to be the alternatives to fiat currencies, memestream cryptocurrencies such as Shiba Inu were only poking fun at the former’s claims.  But as these memecoins got popular, they didn’t go in the direction of developing use cases of the currency. That wasn’t the intention either, neither did the community expect such a popularity in the growth of memecoins. There are, however, a number of merchants today in the US accepting Shiba Inu as a payment method.  Another factor affecting the growth of the Shiba Inu currency is the huge number of crypto whales selling the memecoins. As per a report, whales at one point of time held $1 billion worth of SHIB coins. However, they keep selling and burning the currency from time to time, and now they hold barely a fraction of that amount.  The second quarter of 2022 proved to be a bloodbath for the entire cryptocurrency industry as Terra Luna, FTX and several crypto projects failed in the year. The banking crisis following the collapse of the crypto-friendly Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) also impacted SHIB’s performance.  Why these projections matter  As is evident, a sense of community is crucial to the growth of SHIB. Whether it is their demand to get it listed on Robinhood or asking McDonald’s to accept it as a mode of payment, the community has always rallied around the growth of SHIB.  I’m getting a Shiba Inu #resistanceisfutile — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 14, 2021  It has also become home to a huge community of NFT artists who focus on the Shiba Inu breed of dogs in their artworks.  “Rather than simply dismissing the hype outright, it’s important to realize that what we’re seeing is the mass movement of traders new to crypto moving into the space,” said Ben Caselin, Head of Research and Strategy at AAX. He added, “SHIB coin is a meme coin and embraces that.”  In this article, we will give an overview of the key performance indicators of SHIB such as price and market cap. We will then share with you what most popular crypto-analysts have to say about the future of this meme coin. This information will be complemented by data charts for a better understanding of the trajectory of SHIB so far and later.  Shiba Inu’s Price, Market Cap, and everything in between  During the crypto-bloom of 2021, SHIB’s price continued to soar and hit 0.00003503 in mid-May. Its price further rose by over 34% when it got listed on the crypto-exchange Coinbase in September 2021.  When the Shiba Inu community clamoured to get the cryptocurrency listed on Robinhood Markets Inc., its price soared to an ATH of $0.00008845 in late October 2021. The altcoin, however, was not listed on the exchange before April 2022. At that point in time, it even dislodged Dogecoin to become the most-valued meme coin by market capitalization. The surge also led to its mass adoption by many cryptocurrency enthusiasts.  As the cryptocurrency market crashed during Q2 of 2022, SHIB’s market price also continued to fall. From its April 2022 price of 0.000026, it fell to a little below $0.000008 by mid-June 2022. Since then, it hasn’t performed much better.  SHIB, at press time, was trading at $0.0000087 with a market cap of $5.1 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $97 million.  However, one cannot disregard the fact that along with DOGE, SHIB has been responsible for a flood of meme-coins in the cryptocurrency market such as Bit Shiba, King Shiba and Baby Doge.  Shiba Inu Coin’s 2025 Predictions  Before reading further, we must understand that market predictions of different analysts widely vary. A good number of times, these predictions will prove to be wrong as analysts cannot always foresee events such as political or environmental crises. It is wise that an investor conducts their own research before investing in a cryptocurrency, especially in something as volatile as SHIB.  A Changelly blogpost says that after studying the SHIB prices and market fluctuations, experts predict that SHIB could hit as high as $0.0000440756 and as low as $0.0000366063 in 2025. Its average price is expected to remain at $0.0000376362.  Telegaon writes that according to some crypto experts, the Shiba Inu Coin price can hit a new ATH in 2025. They predict the minimum and maximum prices of SHIB this year to be $0.00009839 and $0.0001928, respectively. Its average price is predicted to be around $0.0001152.  As per DigitalCoinPrice, the minimum and maximum prices of SHIB in 2025 will be $0.0000256 and $0.0000312, with its average price remaining at $0.0000292.  Shiba Inu’s 2030 Predictions  The aforementioned Chanelly blogpost writes that SHIB could hit as high as $0.0002908409 and as low as $0.0002463454 in 2030. Its average price is expected to remain at $0.0002532547.  Telegaon writes that SHIB’s price can hit as high as $0.00112 and as low as $0.0009354 in 2030. Its average price in the said year, however, will be $0.0009915.  The post adds that if users burn enough tokens, a cryptocurrency’s acceptance is bound to increase. But we should understand that for this purpose, it has to have different use cases.  The aforementioned DigitalCoinPrice article predicts that SHIB’s average price in 2030 will be $0.0000889. Its minimum and maximum prices for the year will be $0.0000846 and $0.000091.  Are your SHIB holdings flashing green?

Conclusion  Shiba Inu Coin has continued to grow, hand in hand with the token burns. However, as its supply decreases and demand increases, its price should rise. Ideally. In fact, many investors have become millionaires by investing in this meme coin.  Shiba Inu has a lot of promising possibilities that will keep pushing the market. What also works in its favor is its extremely low price, which is why a lot of people keep buying it.  Shibarium, the platform’s Layer 2 protocol, has been launched. It will allow users to move assets with minor gas fees, facilitating micro transactions over Shiba Inu-based dApps. The team has deployed a host of new and innovative developers to build the UX/UI of its platform and web portals as a part of the same process.  The launch of Shibarium was accompanied by the launch of the TREAT token. It will be used as a reward token on Shiba Inu-based metaverse and games such as the Shiba Collectible Card Game. A limited supply of these coins is reserved for its most loyal Breed members who have been working for years to build public confidence in the entity. The team has also been contemplating launching SHI, a stablecoin; but no concrete information about this coin is there so far.  In January 2022, Shiba Inu Ecosystem announced the arrival of Shiberse, the native metaverse of the Shiba Inu community. As digital coins, games, virtual land and memes populate the Shiberse, it is bound to get popular among an audience that is keen to explore a brave new world beyond the confines of time and space.  The same month, the group tweeted the news about Shiba Eternity, a collectible card game. The game has been developed in close collaboration with the legendary AAA game development studio PlaySide Studios.  We are proud to reveal the name of the Shib CCG game, Shiba Eternity™! We are working alongside @PlaysideStudios on a testing schedule and exciting release! The game will be available in both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. Game on #ShibArmy with #ShibaEternity! pic.twitter.com/iJnyMUVZWb — Shib (@Shibtoken) August 2, 2022  What the enterprise is certain to face is a challenge in this space from Big Tech metaverse ventures such as Yuga Labs’ Otherside and Zuckerberg’s Meta. It is difficult for an independent community such as the Shiba Inu Ecosystem to sustain the might of Big Money and Big Tech. The only way it can gain an edge in this segment is by introducing revolutionary ideas in the metaverse, gaming and NFT segments. So far, we haven’t seen anything new.  In October 2022, Elon Musk announced the launch of a fragrance that can be bought with SHIB, besides PayPal, Google Pay, DOGE and regular bank cards. As cryptocurrency is accepted in collaboration with BitPay payment processor, payments in SHIB are also possible.  And you can pay with Doge! — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 11, 2022  The same month, Google Cloud and Coinbase made an announcement about their relationship for Web 3.0 development initiatives. A select group of clients will also be able to pay for these services using SHIB and other cryptocurrencies. We’ll have to wait and see if the decision is implemented and if other businesses decide to follow suit.  Shibarium’s launch suggests that the Shiba Inu team looks serious about being more than another memecoin, something also indicated by its long-awaited metaverse. As such, SHIB really could be one of the major coins to watch this year, with significant rallies potentially in sight.  Furthermore, its upcoming Metaverse project improves this project’s allure from a tokenomics perspective. As a memecoin, the value of SHIB is driven by how bullish (and large) the Shiba Inu community is at a given point in time.  Analysts speculate that SHIB cryptocurrency might retrace its recovery path as soon as it gets support from the level. However, volume change can be seen declining and under the influence of sellers. Buyers need to come forward to rescue the SHIB token from the seller’s grip.  Early last month, Shiba Inu announced that it will debut its Wagmi Temple at the upcoming SXSW festival. Here, WAGMI stands for “We’re all gonna make it,” a popular phrase among fans of Shiba Inu. Meanwhile, the broader crypto community is representing their belief in the potential of Shiba Inu for growth and success.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vYW1iY3J5cHRvLmNvbS9zaGliYS1pbnUtc2hpYi1wcmljZS1wcmVkaWN0aW9uLTM0L9IBPWh0dHBzOi8vYW1iY3J5cHRvLmNvbS9zaGliYS1pbnUtc2hpYi1wcmljZS1wcmVkaWN0aW9uLTM0L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"explosion","2021-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T15:44:20","Participants in the development land panel during the Southwestern Ontario Real Estate Forum, from left, Domenic Natale of Cooper Construction, Steven Dejonckheere of Slate Asset Management, Kristen Barisdale of GSP Group and Joe Benninger of CBRE. (Don Wilcox, RENX)  Proximity to the burgeoning Greater Toronto Area (GTA) has led to an “explosion” of development land prices, with increases of 500 per cent – or more – in prime areas of Southwestern Ontario over the past few years.  The sector most affected is industrial and employment lands in areas such as Hamilton and the Guelph-Kitchener-Waterloo-Cambridge regions which neighbour the GTA.  “As a participant in the local market for 30 years, it is just absolutely shocking to see this,” CBRE vice president and sales rep Joe Benninger said, speaking during a land panel discussion at the recent Southwestern Ontario Real Estate Forum in Kitchener.  “Industrial lands have been worth $250,000 to $350,000 an acre for almost 30 years I have been in the business and over the last few years it has just exploded to what is now averaging almost a million-and-a-half in Waterloo Region and of course, to a lesser degree but still fairly substantial increase down in London as well.”  The quantity of land being transacted has escalated along with the prices.  “Historically our market is 500 to 800 acres a year. We’ve seen an explosion in transaction volume on the employment land side,” he observed. ""It really started in 2021. Despite the fact the past 12 months has been pretty tough, and I think we’ve seen a softening of transaction activity, there actually still is quite a bit of activity in 2023.”  The region saw over 2,100 acres of industrial, commercial and investment land transact during 2022, and through the end of April this year that figure is over 1,000 acres.  Change in perspective about SW Ontario  One of the most recent examples is an unserviced 7.9-acre plot just outside Cambridge which sold for $16.35 million. Sold to a trucking firm which will be an owner-operator, it sits along the Hwy. 401 corridor on Cedar Creek Rd.  ""I’m not aware of any special motivations other than they really wanted it and it’s suited their needs well,"" Benninger told RENX in a follow-up discussion.  The transaction is indicative of a change in perspective about the region.  “I would suggest it’s a monetary consideration and the value of land they are getting here versus in the GTA,” Kristen Barisdale, vice-president of planning at GSP Group, said during the forum. She noted some of the factors specific to the Kitchener-Waterloo corridor.  “I think we are in a really ideal location community. We’ve got the proximity to (Highway) 401, most of the investment we are seeing in employment is along that stretch with easy access, and we’ve got the population growth to go along with it.”  Factors would be similar in the Hamilton region, which has access to both the regional QEW and 403 highways, and the U.S. border.  Cooper Construction's industrial development ""risk""  For companies which have been developing in the Southwestern Ontario region for many years, the sudden attention is a dramatic change.  Domenic Natale, vice-president of development and real estate for Oakville's Cooper Construction, looked back 20 years to the beginnings of a 600,000-square-foot industrial development property in Guelph.  “At that time anything west of Milton was, 'where is Guelph?' That was a risk we took, to take on the development and say, there is opportunity here,” he explained. “A lot of that market was internal. We weren’t looking at, ‘how do we get GTA companies to come out to that market’. It was more an internal market, internal growth.”  Fast forward to 2018 and 2019, when soaring prices and scarcity of land in the GTA, combined with the first inklings of a warehousing and industrial revival, forced companies to look just beyond its borders.  “When the values in the GTA started getting higher, people started to look west of Milton and say, maybe there’s opportunity,"" he said. ""We started to see a little bit of shift in the last five or six years where we saw the jump from Milton over to Guelph. That was where (GTA) rents where higher, availability was low, (firms) couldn’t find something quick enough to get into the market.  “We started to see the shift and we were able to do larger leasing, 250,000 square feet, which at that time again was kind of unheard of in the southwestern market.”  Cooper was involved as a partner in Guelph’s Hanlon Creek Business Park, where last year it stabilized two large assets (totalling just over 440,000 square feet) and sold its remaining 50 per cent interest to its partner, Summit Industrial Income REIT, for about $55 million.  Slate to redevelop Hamilton's former Stelco lands  In the Hamilton area, the highest profile acquisition is Slate Asset Management’s purchase of the former Stelco lands, putting an 800-acre waterfront industrial redevelopment into play. Slate paid $514 million for the brownfield site, with plans to develop up to 12 million square feet of manufacturing and employment space.  “We saw an opportunity there,” Slate's senior vice-president, development Steven Dejonckheere said. “The Stelco site was behind closed doors for so long, and people assumed you could never unlock it.""  His firm has just released its preliminary vision for the site – to be known as Steelport – and also launched its downtown Corktown multiresidential development.  “There is momentum on the employment side, there is changing infrastructure, there’s momentum on the residential side,” Dejonckheere said of Hamilton. ”We think it is finally hitting that tipping point where you are seeing the number of cranes in the sky, the number of projects. The value that we see is not necessarily just the margins on our projects today, it’s the long-term story on that.”  While industrial is affected by similar headwinds to those in other development sectors, the fundamentals remain strong.  “Rents is what drives most of the decisions,” Natale said, and leasing rate growth means developers can overcome other hurdles. “Capital is a little bit harder to get, interest rates are higher, people putting money into deals right now is a little bit less than it was before, so I think there’s definitely challenges ahead.”  But demand for space remains strong and the population continues to grow, underpinning an optimistic forecast.  “The numbers still work at the rents we are seeing,"" Natale concluded, ""and we’re not hearing that the rents are going to go down. So right now, we are still okay.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vcmVueC5jYS9kZXZlbG9wbWVudC1sYW5kLXByaWNlcy1oYXZlLWV4cGxvZGVkLWluLWd0YXMtYm9yZGVyLXJlZ2lvbnPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

As per Rescue 1122 and police officials, the gas cylinder suddenly exploded in the kitchen of the restaurant located near Siddiqpura Chowk on Circular Road.  They say that following the explosions, the fire engulfed the entire restaurant, forcing the customers, some of them with their families, to immediately leave the place to save their lives.  The officials say that because of the fire, two more gas cylinders in the restaurant’s kitchen exploded after short intervals, leaving the place filled with smoke and shattering the windowpane and glass doors.  They say that on being informed of the explosions, Rescue 1122 teams immediately reached the spot.  They add that some of the families dining at the ground floor and first floor of the two-storey restaurant got trapped in the smoke-filled halls and were evacuated by rescuers.  The officials says that the massive fire was finally extinguished using nine fire-engines, while 31 rescuers took part in the three-hour-long operation that also included cooling process.  However, as the place was searched after completion of the cooling process, bodies of two women and as many men were found in the debris.  Two of the bodies were identified as Muhammad Waseem and Fauzia Bibi, while the others were yet to be identified.  Meanwhile, four customers – Abdur Rahman, Muhammad Kasid, Ali Sheikh and Farman Ali – were seriously injured in the incident, who were provided medical aid by the rescuers and immediately shifted to the district headquarters hospital.  Deputy Commissioner (DC) Mohammad Ashraf says the best medical care is being provided to the injured persons admitted to to the DHQ hospital.  Local police, civil defense and traffic police teams also reached the spot and assisted the rescue operation.

"explosion","2023-05-19","Not Discerned","{""Dharamshala"", ""HimachalPradesh"", ""India""}","2023-05-20T01:52:41","Liam Livingstone has been Punjab Kings' most crucial and effective batter in their otherwise poor campaign in 2022 and 2023. He scored 437 runs in 14 innings last season while picking six wickets as well, where PBKS finished sixth. In the ongoing season, he hit 279 runs in nine matches laced with two fifties which includes a knock of 94, as PBKS finished eighth on the table on Friday after losing to Rajasthan Royals in Dharamsala. Despite what was a decent season for the England star, former India cricketers Harbhajan Singh and Yusuf Pathan were left furious at Livingstone for his bizarre actions in the match against RR. Harbhajan Singh; Liam Livingstone  Unlike the previous games, Livingstone failed to make much of an impact against Rajasthan Royals as he was dismissed for just 9 runs off 13 balls by Navdeep Saini. It happened in the seventh over when Saini, playing only his second game this season, delivered a back-of-the-length ball that nipped back in sharply. Livingstone swung hard at it but failed to make any contact as the ball rattled onto the stumps.  It was PBKS' fourth dismissal for just 50 runs leaving the home team in grave danger in a do-or-die match. However, Livingstone was laughing at his own dismissal and the act left commentators Harbhajan and Pathan furious as they exploded on-air.  “If we were coach, captain or mentor of Punjab Kings and you laugh after getting out to that sort of a shot then we will never pick you (to play in IPL) again,” said Pathan as Harbhajan agreed to it. The latter was in fact baffled at Livingstone's act after the PBKS batter was dismissed cheaply.  Generally, a batter never laughs at his own dismissal or that of his teammates. Even if he does, it mostly is a reflection of his frustration. Harbhajan and Pathan, however, were not amused.  After Livingstone's dismissal, Jitesh Sharma provided some resistance with his 28-ball 44 before a fiery 73-run stand between Sam Curran and Shahrukh Khan saw PBKS finish with 187 for five. Curran smashed four boundaries and two sixes in his 31-ball 49 while the latter scored 41 off 23 with as many boundaries.  In reply, RR lost Jos Buttle in the second over. He registered his third consecutive duck and fifth for the season, before Devdutt Padikkal and Yashasvi Jaiswal struck a 73-run stand, with the former scoring a fifty as the visitors revived. The latter too completed a fifty, his sixth half-century plus this season as he reached the milestone of 600 runs as well.  Eventually, it was Shimron Hetmyer's 28-ball 44 that helped RR complete a four-wicket win which now keeps the team mathematically alive in the race to the playoffs.

Source: Kremlin-aligned news agency RIA Novosti  Quote from Patrushev: ""The terrorist acts committed in Russia, including the murders of Darya Dugina and Vladlen Tatarsky, the bombing of Zakhar Prilepin's [a Ukrainophobic writer and member of the political faction A Just Russia — For Truth] car, the explosion on the Crimean Bridge, as well as the explosion of the Nord Stream gas pipeline and others, were planned and carried out in coordination with the US intelligence services.""

"explosion","2023-04-18","Not Discerned","{""Pittsburgh"", ""Pennsylvania"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T21:54:00","We all know fit is vital for players once they enter the NFL. Not just quarterbacks. From scheme to type of teammates, environment is often the imperceptible element that makes or breaks a young player as he's acclimating to the league.  Let's pinpoint the absolute best fits from the 2023 NFL Draft.  If you're going to play corner in Wink Martindale's system, you're going to need to be comfortable covering on an island in press man. Over the past few seasons, as the Ravens and Giants defensive coordinator, Martindale has been the league's most blitz-happy play-caller, and with that comes a need for suffocating man-to-man ability in the secondary.  That's precisely where Banks thrives. At 6-foot and right around 200 pounds with quality albeit unspectacular length, ridiculous explosion and clear-to-see natural mirroring skills, Banks was born to play on the perimeter in Martindale's system.  Benton is an ultra-physical, stunningly explosive nose tackle with an assertive play style and powerful hands. A three-down defender who's just as apt to crumble the pocket on third down as he is to blow up a run play behind the line, Benton feels like a classic Steelers interior defensive lineman who's going to bring it every snap he's on the field.  From size and athleticism angles, Benton's almost identical to former Dolphins first-round pick Christian Wilkins, and that's the type of hyper-active, pesky defensive tackle who will thrive next to Cam Heyward and across from T.J. Watt and Alex Highsmith in Pittsburgh.  The Bills -- and head coach Sean McDermott -- adore themselves some fast, explosive linebackers. Size be damned. Sure, in 2018, GM Brandon Beane ascended the board to pick the gargantuan Tremaine Edmunds after Josh Allen was selected. Since then, the team has had no issue picking smaller second-level defenders if they explode to the football and are plus coverage players.  That precisely describes Williams, the former Tulane star. A hair under 6-1 and 228 pounds, he's almost exactly the same size as Buffalo's All-Pro linebacker Matt Milano, and he clocked a 4.49 in his 40-yard dash at the combine, which placed in the 94th percentile among linebackers since 1999. He also had 13 pass breakups and two interceptions in his final three seasons for the Green Wave. He's very adept at understanding where he needs to be to follow route combinations and demonstrated awesome awareness when the football was arriving, an advanced skill many linebacker prospects simply do not possess when they enter the NFL.  There's so much DeMarcus Lawrence to Fehoko's on-field profile. Fehoko is actually a bit bigger and plays with better hand work than Lawrence did when he entered the league. In terms of non-stop hustle and outstanding conditioning, the two edge rushers are extremely comparable.  Micah Parsons has become the alpha rusher in Dallas, obviously. Lawrence still lingers as a wily veteran. And the club picked the uber-talented Sam Williams in the second round last year. Fehoko, just like Lawrence did, has the advanced pass-rushing repertoire to outplay his draft position. He registered 153 pressures across 958 pass-rushing snaps in his final three seasons at San Jose State. It's incredibly challenging to maintain such efficiency with that much volume. Fehoko did it. Glorious fit in Dan Quinn's system that prioritizes the front four getting pressure without having to blitz too often.  In the Brian Gutekunst era for the Packers, the organization has emphasized legitimate versatility with their edge rushers, from the signing of Preston Smith and Za'Darius Smith to the utilization of Dean Lowry up and down the line of scrimmage. Brooks is the next in line. I'm not even sure if he should primarily rush from the inside or get after the quarterback from a two-point stance on the edge of the opposing offensive line. He's equally good at both. That's for Green Bay to decide.  While Brooks did not test particularly well for either spot, he looked extraordinarily light-footed on film and generated the most pressures in 2022 among all players who declared for the 2023 draft. How'd he do that? With nasty swim and swipe moves, deceptive bend and high-level hustle to the quarterback.  Michael Onwenu. Joe Thuney. Ted Karras. Shaq Mason. Hjalte Froholdt. Marcus Cannon. Bill Belichick has a knack for discovering quality blockers after the second round in the draft. Sow is next.  A four-year, full-time starter at Eastern Michigan, Sow is ready for any blitz variation or any sized defensive tackle. He's seen it all. At nearly 6-foot-5 and 320-plus pounds with elite athleticism and serious power for the guard spot, he will hit the ground running in the NFL. Frankly, I have no clue why Sow was still available in the fourth round, given the deficit of reliable guard play in the league today.  In their Super Bowl-winning 2022 season, the Chiefs proved the offense was Tyreek Hill proof. Patrick Mahomes had his most efficient campaign as a passer since 2018, when he won MVP. How did Kansas City do it? Scheming and tremendous yards after the catch.  During the regular season, the Chiefs accumulated the most yards after the catch in the NFL (2,850 yards) with the third-most yards after the catch per reception (6.55). Where does Rice truly thrive? Yes, you guessed it. With the ball in his hands, after the catch. In his final two seasons at SMU, Rice forced 35 missed tackles on 160 receptions. Enormous elusiveness rate there. His size and athleticism profiles were spitting images of Brandon Aiyuk. That's who Rice can be in this Patrick Mahomes-powered offense.  3. Christian Gonzalez, CB, Patriots  Like Banks with the Giants, Gonzalez's game is tailor-made to slot into the No. 1 cornerback spot in Belichick's defense. Nearly 6-foot-2 and 200 pounds with 4.38 speed, a 41.5-inch vertical and smooth lateral mobility, there won't be many receivers who can simply ""out-athletic"" Gonzalez in genuine one-on-one situations.  After losing J.C. Jackson in free agency last offseason, New England has needed to reinstall that true alpha corner to the defense. Belichick got one in Gonzalez, who mirrors like a five-year NFL veteran.  2. Devon Achane, RB, Dolphins  In your mind, if you want to flip No. 1 and No. 2 here, I'm cool with it. Both are extraordinary fits from every perceivable angle. Achane is who Mike McDaniel would create in Madden for his offense. Feisty, one-cut type and, of course, most importantly, stupidly fast. Achane's 4.32 tied for the fifth-fastest 40-yard dash time for a running back in the officially recorded combine era (dating back to 1999). He isn't a super-nifty side-to-side back nor is he a bulldozer through traffic. He's experienced finding holes on inside runs before slamming on the accelerators. Despite his small size and speed reputation, Achane was the bellcow at Texas A&M over the past two seasons, with 326 carries, many of which came between the tackles.  I really wrestled with the top two picks here, but I'll go with the quarterback at the top spot simply due to positional value. Richardson's coach, Shane Steichen, was integral to Jalen Hurts' development in Philadelphia. That was well documented during the pre-draft process. Let's not forget Steichen was the Chargers' offensive coordinator during Justin Herbert's epic rookie season in 2022. And really, there's a case to be made that Richardson is a mix of Hurts and Herbert in terms of his overall capabilities at the quarterback position.  Expect plenty of designed runs and play-action deep shots from Richardson in Year 1 with the Colts. Like Steichen did with Hurts in his first full season as the Eagles starter, Richardson will be provided ample easy, high-percentage throws, too. Indianapolis swung for the fences with its first selection in the 2023 draft, and the Richardson-Steichen fit is exquisite.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNzcG9ydHMuY29tL25mbC9uZXdzLzEwLWJlc3QtbmZsLXJvb2tpZS10ZWFtLWZpdHMtZm9yLTIwMjMtYW50aG9ueS1yaWNoYXJkc29uLW9uLWNvbHRzLWRldm9uLWFjaGFuZS13aXRoLWRvbHBoaW5zLWhlYWRsaW5lLWxpc3Qv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"explosion","2023-05-19","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T03:59:03","Rafael Devers goes deep twice as the Red Sox lead vs. the Padres.  SAN DIEGO -- — Rafael Devers homered twice and drove in four runs to help the Boston Red Sox beat San Diego 6-1 Friday night to hand the staggering Padres their 10th loss in 12 games.  Devers and his friend and former teammate, Padres shortstop Xander Bogaerts, took the lineup cards out for the pregame exchange and hugged. Devers then circled the bases in front of Bogaerts in consecutive innings in his 14th career multi-homer game.  Devers hit a solo shot to right so hard leading off the second that he stumbled back a few steps before starting his trot. He hit a three-run homer nearly to the base of the batter's eye in straightaway center field with no outs in the five-run third for a 6-0 lead. He has 13 homers this season.  Both came off lefty Blake Snell (1-6), who allowed six runs and five hits in four innings.  Before the game, Bogaerts said he hoped Devers didn't hit any homers because “he's a dangerous guy. He's truly one of a kind.""  Devers proved his friend right.  “Very happy today that I was able to hit two runs but you have to keep doing adjustments every day,” Devers said through a translator.  “He put two great swings,” manager Alex Cora said. “Around him, everybody put up good at-bats. That was impressive, the third inning. We were grinding at-bats, fouling off pitches, staying on pitches, taking our walks. It was a fun inning.”  Rob Refsnyder hit a two-run, bases-loaded double ahead of Devers' three-run shot to help the Red Sox to their third straight win.  Other than Fernando Tatis Jr.'s leadoff homer in the third off James Paxton (1-0), the Padres' offensive struggles continued on a day when slugger Manny Machado went on the 10-day injured list with a hairline fracture in his left hand. The Padres were booed at game's end, just as they were Wednesday after a loss to Kansas City. They fell to five games under .500 and are 8 1/2 games behind the NL West-leading Los Angeles Dodgers and just one game ahead of the last-place Colorado Rockies.  The Padres managed just Tatis' homer, his sixth, and four singles in six innings off Paxton, who was making only his second start of 2023. He made his Red Sox debut a week earlier, his first big league appearance since April 6, 2021, with Seattle. He missed most of the 2020-22 seasons due to injuries and had Tommy John surgery on April 12, 2021.  “It feels great, just really to contribute to the team and be here pitching again,” said Paxton, who earned his first victory since Aug. 15, 2020, against Boston while he was with the New York Yankees.  Paxton said Devers is ""awesome. His swing is amazing. So good on offense and he does a great job at third base, too. Just an all-around fantastic player, fun to watch.”  Josh Winckowski pitched the final three innings for his second save.  Bogaerts, who left the Red Sox as a free agent and signed a $280 million, 11-year contract in December, was robbed of a single by diving right fielder Alex Verdugo to end the fifth.  EXPLOSION IN SINGLE-A CLUBHOUSE  Two contract workers were burned in a natural gas explosion in the home clubhouse of the Lake Elsinore Storm, the Padres' Class-A affiliate, leading to Friday's game being postponed. The two workers were taken to a hospital. The Padres said no players were involved.  DEVERS AND BOGEY  Devers and Bogaerts went out to eat Thursday, an off day for both teams. “You know what's crazy is, I forgot my wallet at home. I'm not even kidding,"" Bogaerts said. He thought he left it at the ballpark but didn't find it there, and started to get nervous. “I said, 'Man, you've got to pick this up. I don't even have a dollar.'"" Bogaerts said he found his wallet at home, in his backpack, where he put it during the bus ride home from Dodger Stadium last Sunday. ”I haven't told him that piece yet but I told him right away that he's got to pay,” Bogaerts said.  TRAINER'S ROOM  Red Sox: 1B Justin Turner, who was aboard for Devers' three-run shot, left the game with left knee soreness.  Padres: Machado's was hurt when he was hit by a pitch Monday night. His IL stint is retroactive to Tuesday. Manager Bob Melvin said there’s a possibility Machado can return when the Padres play at the New York Yankees next weekend.  UP NEXT  Saturday night's game will feature a marquee matchup between Red Sox LHP Chris Sale (3-2, 5.40 ERA) and Padres RHP Joe Musgrove (1-1, 6.63).  ------  AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP--Sports","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLmh0dHA6Ly93d3cuZXNwbi5jb20vbWxiL3JlY2FwP2dhbWVJZD00MDE0NzE2OTPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Blues eased past Blancos at the Etihad  Catalan coach demands high standards  Belgian midfielder bit back at his boss  WHAT HAPPENED? The Premier League leaders swept their way to a 4-0 victory over the reigning European champions at the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday, allowing them to book a date with Inter in Istanbul on June 10. City made light work of overcoming Real, as they dominated throughout, but demanding coach Guardiola lost his cool with talismanic midfielder De Bruyne at one point during the second half as the Belgian playmaker squandered possession.  WHAT THEY SAID: De Bruyne did not take kindly to the touchline input from his manager and was caught on camera screaming “shut up, shut up” back in the direction of the City dugout.  THE BIGGER PICTURE: On seeing De Bruyne deliver an angry response to the technical area and why he felt the need to deliver such advice in the midst of a heavyweight continental clash, Guardiola told Movistar: “At 2-0 we rushed a lot. Right after the break [Ilkay] Gundogan lost a ball, Kevin made three transitions that weren’t necessary and we rushed a lot when we had to do the opposite, sink them and turn them, sink them and turn them. But it’s normal. It gets close, you rush, and it has cost us more, although in general we have had an extraordinary game.”  AND WHAT'S MORE: Former Belgium coach Thierry Henry - who was on punditry duty for CBS Sports - went on to shed some light as to why De Bruyne was feeling a little emotional, with the Frenchman saying after a post-game chat with the City star: “It was [a touching moment]. I can't say it because I have to keep that private. But from what he said to me, I even more respect how he played tonight and how he came and battled with his team. I can't share what he said because I can't share it. That's how it is. But once again I will go back to, for me he is the most important player.”  IN TWO PHOTOS:  Getty  Getty  WHAT NEXT? Guardiola has questioned De Bruyne’s contribution to the City cause at times this season, but the 31-year-old remains an integral part of the Blues’ plans as they look to chase down a Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League treble in 2022-23.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nb2FsLmNvbS9lbi11cy9uZXdzL3BlcC1ndWFyZGlvbGEtZXhwbGFpbnMtZXhwbG9zaXZlLXNodXQtdXAtcm93LWtldmluLWRlLWJydXluZS1tYW4tY2l0eS1jaGFtcGlvbnMtbGVhZ3VlLXJlYWwtbWFkcmlkL2JsdGRiMWFhZGU2YjVkNWQwN2PSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Auburn had no issue in its doubleheader Friday against Missouri (30-22, 10-19 SEC) as outstanding pitching and powerful bats pushed Auburn (32-19-1, 16-13 SEC) to a 4-0 victory in game one and a 7-2 victory in game two. The wins marked Auburn’s seventh consecutive SEC win, the longest streak in program history since 1995.  Only six Auburn pitchers took the mound between the two games Friday while the Tigers held their opponent to five runs or less for the seventh time in the last eight games.  Auburn also recorded five home runs from four different players over the two games to cruise to a series victory over Missouri.  Game one:  Led by a career high in strikeouts and innings pitched from Chase Allsup, Auburn notched game one of Friday’s doubleheader against Missouri, winning 4-0.  Allsup threw 101 pitches through seven innings to pick up his first win of the season as he struck out seven, only allowed three hits and walked two batters.  “That’s what we’ve always looked for with every opportunity with Chase Allsup,” said head coach Butch Thompson. “So glad that we got back, worked back around to him.”  Junior left-handed pitcher Tanner Bauman came on in relief of Allsup in the eighth and threw two hitless innings to pick up the save as Auburn recorded its first shutout of the season.  After loading the bases in the fourth inning, Auburn seemed poised to score the first run of the game but a strikeout and fly out ended those hopes. The Tigers waited just one inning later to finally get their first run across home.  Senior Kason Howell reached on an infield single and moved to second after a sacrifice bunt. A couple at-bats later, freshman Chris Stanfield stood in the box and hit a chopper to shortstop. Thanks to a tricky bounce that got by Missouri’s shortstop, Howell scored from second which gave Stanfield his 18th RBI of the season.      On the board! ☝️@_chrisstanfield comes thru with two outs.    E5 | Auburn 1, Missouri 0 pic.twitter.com/M7Ytzwd03m — Auburn Baseball (@AuburnBaseball) May 19, 2023      Auburn extended its lead in the sixth after third baseman Bryson Ware and designated hitter Ike Irish hit back-to-back home runs. After recording just two hits through four innings, Auburn’s offense suddenly came alive and tacked on three runs on four hits to grab control of the game.  Ware’s home run marked his 20th of the season — making him just the seventh Tiger in Auburn history to hit 20 or more home runs in a season.  Allsup maintained the Auburn lead in the seventh by allowing just one hit in the inning to end his day on the mound. His seven innings pitched and seven strikeouts surpassed his previous career highs of four innings pitched and five strikeouts.  Auburn scored one more run in the eighth after Irish grounded into a fielder’s choice which scored Bobby Peirce from third, the run marked Irish’s second RBI of the game.  Missouri batter Trevor Austin was hit by a pitch to start the ninth inning as Missouri looked to pull off a ninth-inning rally, but Bauman settled in and forced the next batter into a double play. Bauman’s next batter sent one into center field for an easy fly out to end the game drama-free, allowing the Tigers to take game one of the day and give Bauman the save.  Enjoy what you're reading? Get content from The Auburn Plainsman delivered to your inbox  Game two:  Auburn’s hot pitching did not end after game one as the Tigers’ pitching staff used four pitchers to hold Missouri to two runs in game two, leading Auburn to a 7-2 win.  Left-handed senior Konner Copeland got the start in game two and shined. Picking up his fourth win of the season, Copeland went 5.1 innings and allowed just three hits and one earned run while striking out five.  After what’s been an inconsistent season for Copeland, he now feels confident that he’s turned his play around.  “It had to be a mental piece,” Copeland said. “Just going in knowing that I’m the best person out there at the time, and I’m better than the hitters and just having that mindset and just going out there and compete and shove into the zone. Just whatever happens happens after that.”  Chase Isbell, Zach Crotchfelt and Will Cannon followed Copeland to limit Missouri the rest of the game.  Cole Foster got things started in the first inning with a double down the left field line which scored Stanfield from second.  After the early start, it was all Auburn. Home runs from Cooper McMurray and Foster plus an RBI single from Caden Green pushed Auburn’s lead to 4-0. Missouri began to crawl back with a two-run homer off Isbell in the sixth, but Auburn responded with three runs in the bottom half of the inning. Ware hit his 21st home run of the season to move two homers shy of the Auburn single-season program record.  Ware said matching or passing that record is not something he actively thinks about at the plate.  “I try not to think about it as much as possible,” Ware said. “Just try to stay in my approach, stay short, not try to do too much and just keep on doing what I’ve been doing all season. So, hopefully I can keep that going, and if I have a couple more home runs that’s great, but if not, I just try to help the team out as much as I possibly can.”  Irish scored off a passed ball and Carter Wright scored Howell with an RBI single in the sixth to stretch the Auburn lead.  Howell got on base in the sixth with a double to bring his Auburn career double tally to 71, tied for the most in program history.  Crotchfelt and Cannon allowed just one hit in the final three innings to preserve the win and give Auburn the series victory.  With the win, Auburn sits in a tie for sixth in the SEC with a 16-13 conference record.  Auburn caps off the regular season Saturday at 1 p.m. CST against Missouri before heading to Hoover, Alabama, for the SEC Tournament. Saturday’s game will be televised on SEC Network+.

"explosion","1993-05-21","Not Discerned","{""StokeOnTrent"", ""StokeOnTrent"", ""UnitedKingdom""}","2023-05-19T09:29:15","It is coming up to 30 years ago that John and Denise Coates started to talk about the potential of a gambling business based over the internet.  Their dad Peter, a miner’s son from Goldenhill, had set up the Provincial Racing chain of high street betting shops but that was only part of a wide range of business interests ranging from from stadia catering to launching Signal Radio.  The National Lottery was set up in 1994 against a backdrop of sweeping changes in a well-established but stigmatised industry. Analysts predicted it would prove the death of the betting shop but the Coateses predicted, in the Sentinel, that it would open the door to growth.  “Back in 1995 about eight per cent of the population was involved in gambling in betting shops, although 80 per cent had tried the National Lottery,” John Coates, now joint-chairman of Stoke City, said in a 2002 interview. “We recognised that gambling is for most people an extension of normal social behaviour.”  The exact scale of that growth might have surprised even them. This weekend the family will be listed in the Sunday Times Rich List with a combined wealth of £8.8 billion, putting them 16th in the charts for 2023.  The big change came in 2000 when the catering wing of the Sprintinca group was sold off and the betting arm was brought under the wing of a new company, bet365. It was led by a team of John, Denise, Peter and British Betting Office Association director Will Roseff – and they had to find millions of pounds to try to get to the front of the pack.  'I'LL BE BRUTALLY HONEST' - Alex Neil on leaving Sunderland, transfers and huge Stoke City project  READ MORE: Championship strikers at career crossroads as Stoke step up search for goals  “(They mortgaged the) physical shops, bought the bet365 name off eBay and launched her online start-up from a modular building pitched in a Stoke car park,” summed up the Times.  The first online bets started to be taken a year later and a year after that, they had customers in more than 120 countries.  John said at the time, as Provincial bet365 became just bet365: “Any business venture is a gamble and you have to weigh up whether the loss of your investment offsets the potential gain.  “My father brought the experience of having set up Signal Radio to the business model. He recognised that there would be a huge investment required to set up the infrastructure and technology. But once you have cleared that hurdle the business is very profitable.  “You have to have the aspiration to be more than you already are if you are going to succeed in business. We were already the leading bookmaker in the Midlands, and there was nothing wrong with that. But we believed we could be a strong niche player in a bigger market and that what we needed was ambition, hard work and drive.”  Back then, industry experts expected the global gambling market would be worth £125 billion by 2015. In real life, by last year it had become worth about £370 billion.  (Image: Sentinel)  By 2005, the Coateses decided to dedicate their focus to online and sold its 49 shops to Coral in a deal believed to be worth about £40m.  The licensed booking shop company, which had been established by Peter in 1974, had generated pre-tax profits of £2.2m that year on the back of sales of £73m — up 14 per cent on the same period last year.  But its growth was dwarfed by its internet arm which pushed overall group sales up 35 per cent.  Denise explained: “The business has been successful but the cash betting industry is mature, while the internet and telephone side has grown so big so quickly that 99 per cent of our time had been spent trying to keep up with the pace of development. That side of the company has gone from nothing five years ago to a £650m turnover business and a leader in its field.  “We’ve got 50 betting shops, but the top two have 2,000 a piece which means we’re never going to be a leader, but we are a hugely cash generative and leading player on the internet.  “While the internet is rapidly growing at the moment, we believe there will be a lot of industry consolidation and we want to have a war chest when opportunities become available.”  A year later, the Coateses entered into the Sunday Times Rich List for the first time with a family fortune of £126m.  The rise of their bank account since then has been extraordinary. In the last few months they have launched operations in New Jersey and Colorado but the business headquarters remains firmly rooted in Stoke-on-Trent.  The Sunday Times reports: “Whereas many gambling firms have shifted jobs offshore, Coates has created thousands of roles in and around her hometown. bet365’s headcount is now more than 6,000, after hundreds of extra workers were taken on in 2021/22. Many of these positions are graduate roles, often in short supply in Midlands towns.”  (Image: Phil Radcliffe)  They were also named second on the Sunday Times Tax List, with a liability of £460.2m.  They have also invested £330m into Stoke City over the years, having bought the club back from an Icelandic consortium in 2006. They would like to put in more but for EFL Financial Fair Play rules which guard against owners who cannot afford to pay bills.  John explained recently: ""It's worth clarifying that haven't been any changes yet to the financial regulations. You will have read about the Government white paper, which is the first stage to new law and regulation so it's an important step. If you look at that along with Tracey Crouch's fan-led review, both are pretty scathing about Profit and Sustainability, they don't see that as the right regulation going forward. Let's see how that develops but it hasn't changed yet.  ""The other route to change of the financial regulation is the talks about redistribution (of Premier League broadcast revenue). Within those talks between the Premier League and EFL might come a change of financial regulation. There are two routes to change... but it hasn't changed yet.  ""Clearly we have already gone out a five-year plan, which we're a year into about investment into the stadium and training ground. That was originally trailed as a £20m investment. Unfortunately, or fortunately, I was speaking to (vice-chairman) Richard Smith earlier this week and that's become bigger somehow.  ""It's become bigger, it's become more ambitious and it's exciting. I'm not going to talk about it in this forum. I think the team and maybe even Richard will be talking about that at a later date but there is some really strong investment.  ""In terms of investment in the team and everything else... all I can say is that over the last 15, 16 years we've invested £330m into the club and I can only tell you that our passion for the club remains the same. We just want the club to be successful and that's what we'll be focused on.""  What do you think?

Al Sharpton — who told a packed church that “when they choked Jordan, they put their arms around all of us.”  Sharpton’s explosive comments came three weeks after Neely – who had a long history of mental illness and poilce run-ins – died when former Marine Daniel Penny wrapped him in a chokehold during an outburst on an F Train in Manhattan.  “Because when they choked Jordan, they put their arms around all of us,” Sharpton told the packed Mount Neboh Baptist Church in Harlem on Friday. “All of us have the right to live.”  He also took the time to rip Penny, who has been charged with manslaughter for killing Neely in the May 1 incident.  “Who thought it was alright for this man to choke a brother to death and go home to see his family?” Sharpton asked the crowd. “Who gave the order it was alright to release him?  Neely’s death and the subsequent charges filed against Penny have ignited a firestorm of controversy over whether the Queens resident had a right to lay hands on Neely after the homeless man started ranting and threatening people on the train.  Al Sharpton delivers remarks at the funeral. Daniel William McKnight for NY Post  Jordan Neely’s funeral was held at Mt Neboh Baptist Church in Harlem. Daniel William McKnight for NY Post  At Neely’s funeral, his family, friends and other mourners gathered to honor a different Jordan, who they remembered as talented, albeit troubled, man.  “Jordan was an amazing dancer — phenomenal,” Rocco Polanco, a childhood friend, told The Post. “He was a reflection of Michael Jackson — he had every move down pat, and even had the same facial structure.”  Jordan Neely’s foster brother, Larry Smith (left), in tears at Neely’s funeral on Friday.

Daniel William McKnight for NY Post  Neely’s funeral Friday attracted several mourners who were dressed like Neely’s inspiration, Michael Jackson. Derek French/Shutterstock  When the King of Pop passed away in 2009, it was Neely who lifted them up through his skilled impersonation, he said.  “He made us all feel good when Michael Jackson died,” said Polanco, 19, of the Bronx. “People came to Times Square just to see [Jordan].”  But Neely had gone downhill in recent years, a descent that friends and family have attributed to the brutal murder of his mother in 2007. Neely sank into a deep depression and was never properly treated, they said.  A program for Neely’s funeral service shows him dressed as Michael Jackson. AFP via Getty Images  Polanco said he saw Neely a couple years ago. He could tell his old friend had fallen on hard times.  “I gave him all my money,” Polanco said. “He wasn’t doing too good. I reminded him that we used to dance, and he smirked for a second. Then he went back to a blank face, like he was ashamed.”  Neeely’s slide continued until earlier this month, when witnesses say he went on an explosive tirade on the subway, allegedly throwing garbage at other straphangers, threatening them and claiming he was willing to “[take] a bullet” or go to jail.

But the chokehold allegedly ended up killing him. The city medical examiner ruled Neely’s death a homicide, and noted that he died from “compression of neck (chokehold).”  Penny’s defense team claims he wasn’t trying to kill Neely when he grabbed him — he was merely trying to protect himself and others.

Outside the church, he said only that he was “alright” before he was ushered into a car in the funeral procession.  But others spoke loudly about the injustice they feel Neely endured.  “Here we are in the year 2023 having witnessed a lynching in the public square,” said Yusef Salaam, one of the teenage boys known as the “Central Park Five” who was wrongly convicted and sentenced to prison for allegedly raping a white woman in 1989.  Former Marine Daniel Penny has been charged with second-degree manslaughter for killing Neely on May 1. via REUTERS  Grieving friends and family gathered at the Mount Neboh Baptist Church in Harlem. REUTERS  “A lynching of a black man never given a chance by a system that designed to keep him oppressed,” Salaam said. “A citizen was allowed to be judge, jury and executioner. And it all happened on a train.”  Jumaane Williams, the city’s progressive public advocate, added outside the church that “If a black homeless man had choked a white Marine to death, he’d still be on Rikers Island.”  “We can’t just say you’re allowed to choke someone to death,” Williams said. “Jordan Neely’s life mattered.”  And Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Democratic congresswoman who represents parts of the Bronx and Queens, said Jordan was seen, loved and cared for.  Mourners remembered Neely as a gifted dancer who looked and moved just like Michael Jackson. Valentina Jaramillo/NY Post  Jumaane Williams departs the church after the funeral. Daniel William McKnight for NY Post  “He contributed to this community,” she said. “What we saw today was a gathering of hundreds of people who knew him and saw him and valued him. It’s important a human life is recognized.”  Noel McDonald, a 50-year-old Brooklyn man, said he didn’t know Neely’s family but felt compelled to pay his last respects.  What we know about NYC subway choking victim Jordan Neely Who was Neely? Jordan Neely, 30, a homeless man, was strangled aboard a northbound F train just before 2:30 p.m. May 1, according to police. He reportedly started acting erratically on the train and harassing other passengers before being restrained and ultimately choked by a straphanger, identified as Daniel Penny, a 24-year-old former Marine from Queens. Penny, who was seen on video applying the chokehold, was taken into custody and later released. He was eventually charged with second-degree manslaughter. Why is there fallout over Neely’s death? The city medical examiner ruled Neely’s death a homicide, noting he died due to “compression of neck (chokehold).” Neely’s aunt told The Post that he became a “complete mess” following the brutal murder of his mother in 2007. She noted he was schizophrenic and suffered from PTSD and depression. “The whole system just failed him. He fell through the cracks of the system,” Carolyn Neely said. Who is Penny? 24-year-old former Marine Daniel Penny served as an infantry squad leader and an instructor in water survival while in the Marines Corps from 2017 to 2021, according to his online resume. Penny graduated from high school in West Islip, NY. He surrendered to authorities 11 days after he placed Neely in a fatal chokehold on an F train. READ MORE  “That brother in there was talented,” McDonald told The Post. “He was gifted. And sure he was homeless — he was homeless because he was carrying mental pain from his mother’s murder.”  “All he wanted was food and help and he was choked to death for it,” McDonald continued. “Nobody deserves that. I get it, sometimes people lash out. But that’s not an excuse to kill them … This is about justice.”  Mourners gather for the funeral for Jordan Neely at Mount Neboh Baptist Church in Harlem.

"explosion","2023-07-03","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T07:01:01","More than a third of all new vehicles sold globally in 2030 will be electric , according to the IEA. That’s a doubling of its prediction made only two years ago. Josh Gabbatiss at Carbon Brief summarises the report. The IEA describes the growth as “explosive”: from just 1% of global car sales in 2017, to 14% last year, and now 18% expected by the end of 2023. China has consistently dominated those sales while new policies in the U.S. and EU are driving growth too. Car manufacturers’ electrification ambitions are keeping pace with or, in the case of Europe, slightly ahead of governments. It means that oil-based fuels will start to decline in the next two years. The IEA warns, however, that SUV sales growth almost eliminated all last year’s electric transport emissions savings. SUVs now make up nearly half of global car sales (particularly in the US, Europe and India), including 40% of electric vehicles. The clear implication is that the vehicle electrification success story could be negated by this appetite for these big and inefficient vehicles.  More than one in three new vehicles sold in 2030 will be electric thanks to “explosive” growth in the market, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).  The influential Paris-based group says electric cars are already on track to make up 18% of sales in 2023. With new policies driving growth in the US and the EU, the share of electric models in 2030 is now set to be more than double what it expected just two years ago.  The expansion means that the demand for oil-based fuels such as petrol and diesel in the road transport sector will start to decline within just two years. Around 5% of current oil demand will have been wiped out by 2030, it adds.  The IEA’s new Global EV Outlook report concludes that, by the end of the decade, electric cars sales are on track to cut annual emissions equivalent to Germany’s entire economy.  However, the agency notes that the growing popularity of sports utility vehicles (SUVs) is a “major concern”. Last year, the growth in sales of these large, energy-intensive models nearly cancelled out the emissions reductions from record electric vehicle sales.  Exponential growth  More than 10m electric cars were sold in 2022, reducing global emissions by 80m tonnes of CO2 equivalent (MtCO2e), according to the IEA.  The agency adds that sales are expected to reach 14m by the end of this year. This would amount to 18% of global car sales in 2023, up from 14% a year earlier and just 1% in 2017.  On this trajectory, these vehicles will have nearly quadrupled their market share since 2020, when they made up less than 5% of sales.  The “exponential” growth in electric car sales can be seen in the chart below. China (red) has consistently dominated the market, making up roughly 60% of global sales in 2022.  The other two key players are the US and the EU, both of which have recently raised their 2030 targets for cutting emissions from road transport. In recent months, the IEA notes that both have “passed legislation to match their electrification ambitions.”  According to the new report, a combination of the new CO2 targets for cars and vans in the EU, and the suite of new measures in the Inflation Reduction Act combined with state-level action will continue to drive electric car sales in the coming years.  Under the IEA’s Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), which accounts for policies and measures that have been put in place by governments, electric cars’ share of the market is set to double to 36% by 2030. This narrows the “implementation gap” between action and targets set by governments, which in total would bring this share up to 40%.  As the chart below indicates, this is a significant upward adjustment on the agency’s previous outlooks. In its 2021 outlook, the IEA said electric cars would reach 15% of sales by 2030, a level nearly reached already in 2022. Last year, the IEA said existing policies would drive electric cars’ share to just 21% by 2030.  [Outlooks for electric vehicles’ share of overall global sales, %, 2020-2030, in the IEA’s Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), from successive editions of the agency’s “global EV outlook” reports. Each line indicates the outlook given in that year / SOURCE: IEA. Chart by Joe Goodman for Carbon Brief using Highcharts]  Besides governments, car manufacturers have also been announcing their own targets for electric vehicle sales.  The chart below shows how the goals set by these original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) compare to the pledges announced (yellow dots) and acted upon (green dots) by governments. It indicates that companies’ ambitions are running in line with or, in the case of Europe, slightly ahead of governments.  The IEA notes that in all major markets, these company targets have come after major government policy announcements and net-zero goals, “showing how policy ambitions can spur corporate announcements.”  Deep cuts  The rapid growth in electric car sales under existing government policies is expected to have a significant impact on fossil-fuel use. The IEA says oil demand for road transport is expected to peak around 2025 in the STEPS scenario.  The surge in electric vehicles on the roads would eliminate the need for 5m barrels of oil per day by 2030. This amounts to around 5% of global oil demand today.  The IEA notes that overall this would mean an emissions cut of 700m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) by the end of the decade, roughly the annual emissions of Germany or Saudi Arabia.  (This figure accounts for any fossil fuels used in the generation of electricity to run the electric car fleet.)  (The IEA’s emissions calculations are based on “well-to-wheels” analysis of fuel consumption in cars, rather than full lifecycle emissions. However, even when accounting for emissions from battery and car manufacture, electric vehicles have significantly lower emissions than their fossil-fuelled counterparts in most circumstances.)  If governments go even further and meet the targets they have set themselves both for electric vehicles and clean power generation, 770MtCO2e in emissions would be avoided.  In this scenario, termed the Announced Pledges Scenario (APS), nations would be roughly two-thirds of the way to the IEA’s net-zero emissions by 2050 scenario (NZE), which is compliant with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5C warming target.  To bridge the remaining gap, indicated in red in the chart below, the IEA says governments would need to move faster on decarbonising trucks and buses, in particular.  It notes that 25% of the electric vehicle-related emissions avoided in the NZE can be attributed to the electrification of heavy-duty vehicles.  SUV dominance  The continued growth in sales of large sports utility vehicles (SUVs) almost wiped out the emissions cuts achieved by electric vehicle sales last year, according to the IEA.  SUVs now make up nearly half of global car sales, including 40% of electric vehicles. They are growing in popularity worldwide, particularly in the US, Europe and India.  The IEA says this “overwhelming dominance” is a “major concern.” SUVs’ size means they require more energy to run, more materials to build and, in the case of electric models, larger batteries. All of this means higher emissions and greater environmental impact per mile travelled.  In 2022, the CO2 emissions from driving SUVs increased by 70MtCO2e, the IEA says, with sales growing even as the wider car market contracted. This effectively cancels out most of the 80MtCO2e emissions reductions from new electric vehicles sales that year.  Overall, the IEA says the 330m SUVs on the road today emit around 1GtCO2e.  Around 16% of SUVs sold in 2022 were electric – slightly above the 14% share of EVs in the market overall. As the chart below shows, an increasing share of electric cars on the market in every country are SUVs or other large cars.  As with other electric vehicles, these electric SUVs result in emissions being displaced relative to if they had had a combustion engine instead. In 2022, the IEA says 150,000 barrels per day of oil were avoided due to people driving electric SUVs.  In fact, the agency says that although electric SUVs represented 35% of all electric cars in 2022, their share of oil displacement was higher – around 40% – as SUV drivers tend to use their cars more than owners of smaller cars.  However, the report notes that on top of emissions from driving, “mitigating the impacts of higher battery sizes will also be important.” It notes that the larger amounts of minerals required to build SUV batteries can result in CO2 emissions from processing and manufacturing being more than 70% higher than regular electric car batteries.  ***  Josh Gabbatiss is a Climate and Energy Journalist at Carbon Brief  This article is published under a CC license","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL2VuZXJneXBvc3QuZXUvZ2xvYmFsLWV4cGxvc2l2ZS1ncm93dGgtbWVhbnMtMS1pbi0zLW5ldy1jYXJzLXdpbGwtYmUtZWxlY3RyaWMtYnktMjAzMC1idXQtc3V2cy1jb3VsZC13aXBlLW91dC10aG9zZS1nYWlucy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"explosion","2023-04-15","Not Discerned","{""BatonRouge"", ""Louisiana"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T02:36:25","The decorated high school career of LSU freshman catcher Maci Bergeron gave way to a challenging first season filled with plenty of ebbs and flow.  Bergeron enjoyed a prolific four-year career at Notre Dame High in Crowley with 78 home runs where she twice was named the state’s Gatorade Player of the Year. Those accolades only served as a reminder of the promise the native of Rayne had when she batted around .200 without a homer during the regular season.  Bergeron, given the opportunity to start in her first postseason game, enjoyed a memorable moment in top-seeded LSU’s 12-2 run-rule-victory in five innings in NCAA Regional play Friday over fourth-seeded Prairie View A&M before a crowd of 2,084 at Tiger Park.  Her first career homer came in her first plate appearance on a drive to straight-away center field that gave LSU a 4-1 lead and brought smiles from coach Beth Torina and her teammates.  “We’re all very close,” Bergeron said of her teammates’ reaction. “We have a special group this year. We have great team chemistry. We all really love each other. For anyone who would hit their first home run they would be excited for them.”  Said Torina of Bergeron: “She’s never stopped working. Our team knows how talented she is and what she’s capable of. To see her do what she’s capable of is fun for everyone. This team is so tight knit. They truly love being together. They love celebrating something like that.”  LSU (41-15) advances to face second-seeded UL-Lafayette, a 5-0 winner over Omaha, at noon in Saturday’s winners’ bracket at Tiger Park. The two I-10 rivals split meetings during the regular season. The game will be streamed by ESPN+ and broadcast locally by 107.3-FM  “The biggest thing is staying true to who we are,” LSU shortstop Taylor Pleasants said. “Not letting the atmosphere determine how we play or how we feel. We know they bring a large crowd. It makes it a lot more fun here at Tiger Park. We’re just looking forward to it.”  Bergeron was one of two players to homer in the shortened contest, backing LSU’s 15-hit onslaught, which included six extra-base hits, and 14th run-rule victory of the season. Left fielder Ali Newland (2-for-2) also connected for a two-run shot off the scoreboard in right field in the third inning.  The Tigers matched a season-high for runs which was the third most they’ve scored in postseason play.  Five of LSU’s starters collected at least two hits led by Pleasants’ 3-for-3 performance, including a double, with a team-high three RBIs. Third baseman Danieca Coffey, center fielder Ciara Briggs, right fielder McKenzie Redoutey and first baseman Raleen Gutierrez all collected two hits with Coffey and Briggs each scoring three runs.  “I thought our team played aggressive, they came out swinging. I love seeing what I saw from our offense,” LSU coach Beth Torina, whose team improved to 22-2 in regional openers. “They did a great job of setting the tone in this first postseason game. Getting a win under your belt in that first one helps with the nerves and the things that go with hosting.”  Raelin Chaffin (6-1) got her first taste of postseason competition and was the beneficiary of her team’s offensive explosion. The sophomore right-hander allowed a first-inning homer to Biviana Figueroa of Prairie View (30-19) and RBI-double in the fourth, but threw her fourth complete game of the season in her 11th start – yielding two hits with six walks and eight strikeouts.  Figuero’s two-out homer represented the first time LSU’s allowed a run and trailed in four NCAA Regional games against SWAC opponents, a span of 16 innings.  “The most important thing is that we got a win today,” Torina said of Chaffin. “I think she probably didn’t have her best stuff. She definitely didn’t have her curveball which is her best pitch. The fact that she was able to get a postseason win without her best stuff is pretty impressive. She kept us in it, gave us a chance to win. Any postseason win is good.”  LSU’s three-run first enabled the Tigers to recapture the lead for good. Coffey scored on Georgia Clark’s sacrifice fly and a throwing error on the play enabled Briggs to score. Redoutey followed with a sacrifice fly to make it 3-1.  The Tigers gained separation with a four-run second, ignited by Bergeron’s lead-off homer and Pleasants’ two run single to right-center stretched the lead to 7-1.  Bergeron’s homer came on a 1-0 pitch from losing pitcher Jerrica Rojas (11-3).  “It’s a testament of continuing to work hard no matter what,” Bergeron said. “You’re going to face adversity at some point. This has made me a better player.”  LSU added four runs on five hits in the third with Gutierrez scoring from third on a passed ball. Pleasants contributed an RBI-single followed by Newland’s 2-run homer – her sixth of the season – to make it 12-1 and capped the team’s stretch of 12 unanswered runs.  “We talked all week that we had to come in believing we were the best team in the park because if you don’t, then you’re already beat,” Newland said. “We believe this team is talented and capable of doing great things.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aWdlcnJhZy5jb20vd2hhdC1hLWZlZWxpbmctZnJlc2htYW4tbWFjaS1iZXJnZXJvbi1ibGFzdHMtZmlyc3QtY2FyZWVyLWhvbWVyLXRvLWhpZ2hsaWdodC1sc3VzLW9mZmVuc2l2ZS1leHBsb3Npb24taW4tbmNhYS1yZWdpb25hbC13aW4v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

U.S. oil exports this year hit a record 4.5 million barrels per day as competitive pricing for U.S. grades and China's reopening after COVID-19 have fueled global demand for oil.  Tanker Sonangol Porto Amboim, carrying light sweet oil, left Corpus Christi, Texas, on May 16 for Saldanha Bay on the west coast of South Africa, according to ship tracking information from Refinitiv Eikon and energy data provider Kpler.  South Africa gets most of its oil from West and Central Africa as well as Saudi Arabia, according to Kpler data. But competitive pricing for U.S. crude and changes to oil flows since Russia's invasion of Ukraine have opened new markets. The last shipment of U.S. oil went to South Africa in May 2021, U.S. customs data showed.  The 850,000 barrel-cargo of West Texas Light was purchased by Swiss-commodities trader Glencore (GLEN.L), a person familiar with the matter said.  Glencore's majority-owned Astron Energy restarted production at its 100,000 barrel per day Cape Town refinery nearly three years after a deadly explosion shuttered operations and killed two workers.  Glencore declined to comment on the shipment. Astron confirmed that the refinery restarted as part of a phased process and was producing at its planned capacity.  Astron, which has the second-largest retail fuel network in southern Africa, receives its oil from tankers discharging in Saldanha Bay and transports the oil to the Cape Town refinery via pipeline, according to the refiner's website.

GlobiTech also considered sites in Ohio and South Korea. GlobiTech, founded in 1999, already builds silicon wafers in Sherman. The new 3.2 million-square-foot plant will be built in four phases.  3. Centurion American’s huge land buy  Earlier this year, Centurion American Development – one of North Texas’ largest community builders – bought land for a more than 1,500-acre residential development near where the Texas Instruments and GlobiTech projects are being built. The site for Cottonwood, as the new community will be called, is just off U.S. Highway 75 in Grayson County. It’s planned to have 4,000 single-family lots, along with 1,450 rental units and 250,000 square feet of commercial and retail space.  4. Gunter land buys  Just north of fast-growing Celina, Gunter is the next town in the path of development. Two large land buys took place last fall with the potential to bring hundreds of new homes and retail and offices to the community.  In August, Centurion American bought Taylor Ranch, a 500-acre property west of Preston Road, for a master-planned community. The ranch is near the future extension of the Dallas North Tollway. Gunter, in the southwest corner of Grayson County, is seeing an increase in residential land sales as builders and developers construct thousands of houses to the south in Celina.  In November, an investor group purchased the 281-acre Platinum Ranch southwest of Gunter. It’s also along the tollway’s future route. The land is zoned for a master-planned mixed-use project and it’s about a mile north of Legacy Hills, a 3,200-acre community under construction in Celina that will include 7,000 homes.  5. Finisar’s potential expansion  At the end of 2022, Finisar said it’s also considering Sherman for a new $3 billion plant that would produce wafers for semiconductor chips. The company already operates a plant that makes the specialized lasers in Apple’s iPhone facial recognition technology on a nearly 77-acre campus in Sherman.  The new plant would create 700 jobs initially, though that eventually could grow to 4,000. Finisar said Sherman is competing with other company-owned sites in Easton, Pa., Warren, N.J., and Newton Aycliffe, United Kingdom. Construction would begin in 2025, with commercial operations launching in 2028.  Bonus plays  A new casino recently opened on the Oklahoma side of Lake Texoma.  West Bay Casino & Resort is a Chickasaw Nation gaming casino and hotel overlooking the lake near Kingston, Okla. The 9,600-square-foot casino features 275 slot machines, table games and a restaurant. It has 40 guest rooms and 10 lakefront rental cabins.  The Chickasaw tribe owns and operates Winstar World Casino and Resort, which it markets as the world’s largest casino. The 400,000-square-foot gaming floor, resort and soon-to-open Lucas Oil Live entertainment venue in Thackerville, Okla., are a popular destination for Dallas-Fort Worth residents.  The Choctaw Nation’s flagship casino and resort in Durant, Okla., also is just east of Lake Texoma on U.S. Highway 75.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9yZWFsLWVzdGF0ZS8yMDIzLzA1LzE5LzUtYmlnLXBsYW5zLXRoYXQtY291bGQtYnJpbmctZXhwbG9zaXZlLWdyb3d0aC10by1hbm90aGVyLWNvdW50eS1ub3J0aC1vZi1kYWxsYXMv0gGaAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhbGxhc25ld3MuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlLzIwMjMvMDUvMTkvNS1iaWctcGxhbnMtdGhhdC1jb3VsZC1icmluZy1leHBsb3NpdmUtZ3Jvd3RoLXRvLWFub3RoZXItY291bnR5LW5vcnRoLW9mLWRhbGxhcy8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

According to the entities’ concise announcement message, the new unit will boast a “cross-functional team of copyright, technical, distribution, legal, business, and product experts” from both BMI and ASCAP.  And these individuals, the PROs communicated, will zero in on “mitigating and preventing fraud or erroneous activities,” chief among them “the registration of musical works that can result in financial loss or operational inefficiencies.”  “The team will focus on maintaining data integrity within the volumes of registration requests and protocols around identity verification and validation, among other areas,” explained ASCAP and BMI, which have partnered on the initiative as AI’s industry role continues to grow. “In addition to raising awareness around suspicious activity and schemes, the task force will work with other partners around the globe to share best practices and information that is not deemed competitively sensitive.”  Expanding upon the AI point, BMI president and CEO Mike O’Neill went ahead and highlighted “the explosion of music being uploaded to digital platforms” when describing the reasons behind and objectives of the task-force partnership.  “The integrity of our data is paramount and something we spend an enormous amount of time and effort to protect,” said O’Neill, whose organization in late March celebrated a “massive” rate ruling. “Given the explosion of music being uploaded to digital platforms and the speed in which that information connects to databases around the world, we felt it made sense to join forces with ASCAP to address these concerns. Bad actors don’t just limit themselves to one company, or one territory, and the more we can collaborate on this issue, the better it is for everyone involved.”  Meanwhile, ASCAP head Elizabeth Matthews in remarks of her own touched upon the perceived need for “all collective management organizations and DSPs” to tackle fraud “with increasing frequency.”  “Fraud is a complex global challenge that all collective management organizations and DSPs must confront with increasing frequency,” indicated Matthews, whose PRO reported “record-high” revenue and distributions for 2022. “Building on the strength of our Songview partnership and leveraging our expertise in building an interconnected data platform, ASCAP and BMI are uniquely positioned to lead this collaborative and proactive approach to enhance the integrity of data in the music industry and to protect the rights and royalties of music creators.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWxtdXNpY25ld3MuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTkvYXNjYXAtYm1pLXRhc2stZm9yY2UtMjAyMy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

On October 23 last year, a vehicle carrying IED and being driven by Mubeen exploded outside the Kottai Eswaran Temple in Tamil Nadu’s Coimbatore city. (PTI)  Mubeen and his maternal cousins, Mohammad Asarutheen and Afsar Khan, had also procured unknown quantities of charcoal, aluminium powder, matchboxes, and chemical benzaldehyde dimethyl acetal, besides four cylinders and three drums for making the bomb, said the charge sheet filed on April 20.  Also read: Egra bomb blast: MP Sukanta Majumdar writes to Amit Shah, seeks NIA probe in matter  On October 23 last year, a vehicle carrying improvised explosive device (IED) and being driven by Mubeen exploded outside the Kottai Eswaran Temple in Tamil Nadu’s Coimbatore city. Mubeen was killed in the blast.  According to the NIA charge sheet, Mubeen and his cousins started procuring raw material for IED in March last year, soon after it was decided during conspiracy meetings held in interiors of Sathyamangalam forest in Erode district in February that Kottai Eswaran temple would be targeted.  The purchases were made in small quantities, ranging from 2 kg to 30 kg, through e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, Flipkart, and an online fertiliser supplier as well as local dealers.  “...Jameesha Mubeen, Asarutheen and Afsar Khan purchased a total of 134 kg of potassium nitrate, 56 kg of sulphur, three drums and four cylinders (of which two were recovered from his home). Besides, unknown quantities of charcoal, aluminium powder, matchboxes and benzaldehyde dimethyl acetal were sourced locally,” the charge sheet, seen by HT, said.  Asarutheen and Afsar, according to the federal anti-terror probe agency, had also “weighed, mixed and packed the chemical constituents used to manufacture the vehicle-borne IED used in the attack”. Other conspirators in the case include Mohammed Thalha, Firos, Mohammed Riyas, Navas, Mohammed Azharuddin, Sheikh Hidayatullah, Umar Farooq and Sanofar Ali.  After the blast, the charge sheet said, some of the accused persons had used “iShredder” — a military grade security data shredder which securely deletes data leaving it irrecoverable — on their devices.  At the time of the attack, Mubeen’s WhatsApp display photo was a text that said, “When you receive the news of my death. Forgive my mistakes. Mask my shortcomings. Do attend my Janaza (funeral). Keep me in your prayers”.  The charge sheet further stated that NIA found three self-confession videos from Mubeen’s devices. The agency also recovered handwritten notes from his residence “which revealed his critical views on democratic system” and “targets including government buildings, district court, parks, railway stations etc.”  Also read: Bengal firecracker factory blast prime accused traced to Cuttack hospital: Police  Terrorist organisation Islamic State (IS) had claimed responsibility for the blast through its mouthpiece “Voice of Khorasan”, saying it was carried out as a “revenge” to uphold the “honour” of their religion.  NIA has till date arrested around 175 people in close to 40 cases of terror attacks, conspiracy and funding which have been inspired by the IS ideology in the country. The charge sheets have been filed in over 32 cases linked to the IS.  The agency has also prepared a databank on IS modules busted so far with detailed analysis on handlers, funding, modus operandi, countries visited, and ideologues.","https://news.google.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?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"explosion","2006-10-12","Not Discerned","{""Bogota"", ""DistritoCapital"", ""Colombia""}","2023-05-19T00:51:37","With an adult beverage in one hand and a solid steel disk in the other, I steadied myself and took aim at the little red target, a small explosive about 20 feet away.  POW!  My friends cheered and chugged as the smell of gunpowder filled the air, chalking up another three points for our team.  Alcohol and explosives are not typically a recommended combination for a good time. Seriously, don't try this at home.  But when you visit Bogotá, or nearly any community in Colombia, it's not only socially acceptable — it's the national sport. The game is called tejo, and it reaches to the heart of Colombian culture.  Explosive fun  In this South American country of more than 51 million people, Colombians are as passionate about tejo as Americans are about football, baseball, basketball and soccer combined. A movement is underway to make it an Olympic sport, although organizers admit the association with alcohol needs to be eliminated.  Tejo is also popular in Venezuela, Ecuador and Panama, but an online search reveals fewer than a dozen tejo bars in the U.S. Those are in Florida and New Jersey, where large populations of Colombian immigrants have settled.  So what is tejo?  Pronounced TAY-ho, the game is often compared to cornhole. But the otherwise soft cloth bags filled with resin or corn are replaced with a solid steel disk that weighs about a pound. The disk is called the tejo.  The tejo target features a clay surface and tiny explosive “mechas” containing gunpowder.  Like cornhole, the backdrop is tilted at an angle, but the surface is clay rather than wood. There is no hole in which to sink your disk. Instead, there is a metal circle in the clay outlined by small triangles of paper. The folded paper triangles, called mechas, hold the smallest amount of gunpowder. When hit by a steel disk, the mecha explodes with a force similar to a cap gun.  Hitting the center of the ring and making one of the little pieces of paper explode scores nine points. Hitting the outside edge of the circle while blowing things up is three points. Closest to the ring without blowing things up is one point.  The first team to score 21 points wins.  We had five people on our team and to be quite honest, we were having so much fun that we totally forgot to keep score. But we cheered heartily for anyone on any team who made the thing blow up. A couple of times, my disk hit the mecha, but it just fizzled like sad fireworks. We counted it as a win anyway.  After an hour or two, our hands and clothes were dirty from digging our disks out of the clay, and a few on our team were tipsy, but we were all feeling quite macho for our athletic accomplishments in another culture.  A tejo disc.  'Let's blow it up'  Tejo is thought to be about 500 years old and first played in the town of Turmequé, about 65 miles north of Bogotá in the department of Boyacá. So occasionally you'll hear tejo called turmequé. The national championships take place in Turmequé in October. Like football in the U.S., autumn is the season for professional tejo, but Colombians play the game year-round.  Historically, it's believed that the disks were made of gold, but you can see how that might become a problem in the modern era. Gunpowder didn't become a part of the sport until the 1960s.  Our introduction to tejo came from Daniel Lozano, co-founder of Tejo La Embajada, a tejo bar in Bogotá's San Felipe arts and culture district. ""La Embajada"" translates to ambassador or embassy of tejo. I particularly liked the sign on the wall ""Vamos a reventarla"" which translates to ""Let's blow it up.""  Lozano admits he's an amateur tejo player and assured us that you do not have to be an expert to have fun.  ""I love tejo's capacity to amplify happiness,"" he said. ""You want to have a good time with your friends and as soon as someone hits the first mecha and you hear the small boom, it is arousing.""  In Bogotá, most tejo courts are indoors because the climate and elevation all but guarantee a daily afternoon rain shower. Tejo is not a spectator sport. There are no stadiums or arenas dedicated to tejo and no regional teams or superstars selling jerseys, hats or other paraphernalia.  At Tejo La Embajada, there are a few tables near the bar where you can have a snack and see the action on one of the courts through a chicken-wire fence of sorts. If you are a first-timer, Lozano and his English-speaking staff at Tejo La Embajada will provide some instruction and clarification on keeping score.  But folks, it's not that complicated. Just go and blow things up.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9ibG93LWl0LXVwLWluLWJvZ290YS10ZWpvLXRoZS1jb2xvbWJpYW4tbmF0aW9uYWwtc3BvcnQtaXMtZXhwbG9zaXZlLWZ1bi82MDAyNzYyMTQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Sleep tight, Wuggets Wation 💤 pic.twitter.com/iz3tkH0NYB — Denver Nuggets (@nuggets) May 19, 2023  The series will now shift to Game 3 as the Lakers are in a must-win situation, hoping to claw back and win the series. It will be no easy task, as the Lakers will now have to beat the Nuggets four times in the next five games to make the NBA Finals.  The star duo of the Lakers, Anthony Davis and LeBron James, both gave mediocre performances in the game. Despite nearly notching a triple-double, James shot 0-6 from three-point range, including missing three in the crucial fourth quarter. Davis would miss 11 of his 15-shot attempts.  Advertisement  In the postgame, James was looking forward to Game 3. “I think we improved from Game 1 to Game 2, and if we can do the same thing from Game 2 to Game 3, we put ourselves in a position to win.”  Both James and Davis vowed to be better for the 7:30 ET tip at Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles.  Also notable was James turning his ankle in the game, but he plans to be ready to play on Saturday. “A little ankle isn’t going to stop me,” James said to ESPN.  For the Nuggets, Murray reflected on his total of 37 points, and enjoyed a moment where he eyed ESPN broadcaster Mike Breen and mouthed his trademark “Bang!”  “When I was little, I used to count down the seconds off the shot clock and make the shot and talk like Marv Albert and Mike Breen,” Murray said. “Just the imagination running as a kid. When you get in that moment and you see your fam in the crowd, see your little brother, see Mike Breen there, all these little reminders, they all pay dividends and make that moment a little more special. Just kind of lock you back in.”  Not to be overlooked, two-time league MVP Nikola Jokic dropped another triple-double with 23 points, 17 rebounds and 12 assists.

"explosion","1945-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Hiroshima"", ""Hiroshima"", ""Japan""}","2023-05-19T14:09:01","We, the Leaders of the G7, met at a historical juncture in Hiroshima, which together with Nagasaki offers a reminder of the unprecedented devastation and immense human suffering the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki experienced as a result of the atomic bombings of 1945. In a solemn and reflective moment, we reaffirm, in this first G7 Leaders’ document with a particular focus on nuclear disarmament, our commitment to achieving a world without nuclear weapons with undiminished security for all.    We underscore the importance of the 77-year record of non-use of nuclear weapons. Russia’s irresponsible nuclear rhetoric, undermining of arms control regimes, and stated intent to deploy nuclear weapons in Belarus are dangerous and unacceptable. We recall the statement in Bali of all G20 leaders, including Russia. In this context, we reiterate our position that threats by Russia of nuclear weapon use, let alone any use of nuclear weapons by Russia, in the context of its aggression against Ukraine are inadmissible. We recall the Joint Statement of the Leaders of the Five Nuclear-Weapon States issued on January 3, 2022, on Preventing Nuclear War and Avoiding Arms Races, and affirm that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. We call on Russia to recommit – in words and deeds – to the principles enshrined in that Statement. Our security policies are based on the understanding that nuclear weapons, for as long as they exist, should serve defensive purposes, deter aggression and prevent war and coercion.    The overall decline in global nuclear arsenals achieved since the end of the Cold War must continue and not be reversed. The Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) must be upheld as the cornerstone of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime and the foundation for the pursuit of nuclear disarmament and peaceful uses of nuclear energy. We reaffirm our commitment to the ultimate goal of a world without nuclear weapons with undiminished security for all, achieved through a realistic, pragmatic and responsible approach. In this regard, Japan’s “Hiroshima Action Plan” is a welcome contribution. We deeply regret Russia’s decision to undermine the New START Treaty, and call on Russia to enable a return to full implementation of the Treaty. At the same time, China’s accelerating build-up of its nuclear arsenal without transparency nor meaningful dialogue poses a concern to global and regional stability.    We emphasize the importance of transparency with regard to nuclear weapons and welcome actions already taken by the United States, France and the United Kingdom to promote effective and responsible transparency measures through providing data on their nuclear forces and the objective size of their nuclear arsenal. We call on nuclear-weapon States that have not yet done so to follow suit. To promote transparency, we also call on nuclear-weapon States that have yet to do so to engage with non-nuclear-weapon States in a meaningful dialogue on transparency regarding their nuclear arsenals and limiting nuclear competition, including through an open explanation of national reports coupled with an interactive discussion with non-nuclear-weapon States and civil society participants at future NPT related meetings. In this regard, we stress the benefit of pre-notification of relevant strategic activities, as a substantial contribution to risk reduction. The G7 recognizes the need for concrete steps by nuclear-weapon States to reduce strategic risks. We call on China and Russia to engage substantively in relevant multilateral and bilateral forums, in line with their obligations under the NPT, including Article VI.    We call for the immediate commencement of long overdue negotiations of a treaty banning the production of fissile material for use in nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices. 2023 will mark the 30th year since the consensual adoption of a United Nations (UN) General Assembly resolution calling for a Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty (FMCT), and we urge all countries to refocus political attention towards the FMCT as a priority action to forestall a recurrence of the nuclear arms race, including any and all independent or complementary efforts. In this regard, we call on all states that have not yet done so to declare and maintain voluntary moratoria on the production of fissile material for use in nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.    We are resolute in our view that no nation should carry out any nuclear weapon test explosion or other nuclear explosion, condemn any threats to do so, and emphasize that bringing the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) into force is another urgent matter. We remain committed to upholding the global norm against nuclear explosive testing until it is legally binding and call on all states to declare new or maintain existing moratoriums on nuclear weapon test explosions or any other nuclear explosions. We express our concern over Russia’s announcement of its readiness to conduct a nuclear test, and we call for Russia’s adherence to its moratorium on nuclear tests. We further underscore the essential role of the CTBTO Preparatory Commission in detecting and reporting suspected nuclear explosions worldwide. The G7, collectively, has supported the CTBTO’s activities in the amount of more than 100 million US dollars in 2023. We reaffirm the G7’s commitment to providing sufficient resources to ensure the continued operation and the long-term sustainability of all elements of the CTBT verification system and call on others to do the same.    A world without nuclear weapons cannot be achieved without nuclear non-proliferation. We reiterate our unwavering commitment to the goal of North Korea’s complete, verifiable, and irreversible abandonment of its nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs, and any other weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and ballistic missile programs in accordance with relevant UN Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs). We demand North Korea refrain from any other destabilizing or provocative actions, including any further nuclear tests or launches that use ballistic missile technology. North Korea cannot and will never have the status of a nuclear-weapon State under the NPT. It is critical that sanctions be fully and scrupulously implemented by all states and remain in place for as long as North Korea’s WMD and ballistic missile programs exist. We remain deeply concerned about Iran’s unabated escalation of its nuclear program, which has no credible civilian justification and brings it dangerously close to actual weapon-related activities. We reiterate our clear determination that Iran must never develop a nuclear weapon and we call on all countries to support the implementation of UNSCR 2231. We urge Iran to cease nuclear escalations. We call on Iran to fulfill its legal obligations and political commitments regarding nuclear non-proliferation without further delay. A diplomatic solution remains the best way to resolve international concerns regarding Iran’s nuclear program. In that context, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action continues to provide a useful reference. We call on Iran to uphold its safeguards obligations and stated commitments with prompt and concrete action. We commend and continue to fully support the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA) crucial mandates and efforts in Iran.    In these times of uncertainty and tension, it is of paramount importance to preserve, resource and strengthen existing regimes and other global efforts. We urge all states to take their responsibilities seriously to meet the highest standards of safeguards, safety, and security in promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, science, and technology, including those related to the deployment of next-generation nuclear technologies. We further express our profound concern over Russia’s attempt to control Ukraine’s nuclear facilities, which poses serious nuclear safety and security risks and is in total disregard of Ukraine’s right under the NPT to pursue peaceful uses of nuclear energy. We reaffirm the importance of the implementation of the highest standards of safeguards of the IAEA and the universal adoption of the Additional Protocol (AP) as fundamental components of the nuclear non-proliferation regime. We will promote a reliable and responsible nuclear supply chain, in accordance with the highest standards of nuclear non-proliferation, including the application of the AP. We support further discussions within the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) towards the establishment of the AP as a condition of supply in the Group’s guidelines. Those G7 countries which opt for nuclear power, or related peaceful nuclear applications, recognize that the use of nuclear energy, science, and technology contributes to providing affordable low-carbon energy. The G7 notes the contribution of nuclear technology applications, in such fields as medicine or isotope hydrology, to promoting prosperity and addressing the UN Sustainable Development Goals. We reiterate our utmost commitment to the G7-led Global Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction, which for more than 20 years has delivered concrete impactful programming to advance nuclear non-proliferation in every part of the world.    We emphasize that the transparency of the management of civil plutonium must be maintained. We oppose any attempt to produce or support the production of plutonium for military programs under the guise of civilian programs, which undermines the objectives of the NPT including the promotion of peaceful uses of nuclear energy. In this regard, we underscore the importance of the implementation of the Guidelines for the Management of Plutonium (INFCIRC 549). We call on all states that committed to reporting annually their holdings of all plutonium in peaceful nuclear activities to the IAEA to fulfill those commitments. We recognize the need to manage civil stocks of highly enriched uranium with the same sense of responsibility as the plutonium covered by these guidelines. We also commit to prioritizing efforts to reduce the production and accumulation of weapons-usable nuclear material for civil purposes around the world.    Achieving the world we hope to see requires a global effort to take us from the harsh reality to the ideal, no matter how narrow the path may be.

"explosion","2023-04-14","13:30:00","{""LosAngeles"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T17:07:11","The multi-car pile-up that is “Fast X” is either an example of how there are no original ideas left in a franchise that ran out of gas five films ago or just the fact that no one cares anymore because they know moviegoers will buy tickets even if the film is a total wreck. In the case of this clunker, it is a bit of both.  Dom Toretto – as portrayed through the wooden acting of Vin Diesel – finds himself and his family members being hunted by the law. This franchise has been filled with people who wander between law and lawlessness on a regular basis, so this approach is nothing new. Having them on the run sets up a branching out of the group to multiple storylines that are equally trite and predictable.  Their troubles with the law comes after the obligatory scene where Dom drones on and on about the importance of family. Director Louis Leterrier (“Clash of the Titans”) even drags out Rita Moreno to give Toretto a pep talk on family.  This family element is so big that anyone who is a relative of someone who has been in any of the “The Fast and the Furious” films gets to show up in this production. It is all part of the effort to fill the movie with so many bits and pieces, the lack of a cohesive story isn’t as obvious.  What passes as the idiotic story arc features Jason Momoa as the villain who wants to make Toretto suffer. His anger goes back to 2011 in “Fast Five” when Toretto was part of a bank vault heist that resulted in death and destruction. One of those deaths is what has sent Momoa’s character on his melodramatic quest for revenge on Toretto by hurting him and his family.  He should show them clips of his performance in this film if he wants to inflict the most pain. Someone forgot to tell Monoa that he is supposed to be maniacal and not comical if there is any chance of real tension. At least his work as “Aquaman” is no longer the biggest blemish on his career.  Don’t worry if you haven’t seen “Fast Five.” A major part of “Fast X” features flashback scenes, characters talking about how those who have been fast and furious have escaped the law and an endless string of cameo appearances. If anyone even walked across a scene in one of the nine previous movies, they are back like a celebrity game of Whack-a-Mole.  Ironically, a film that pounds the message of keeping the family together has a script by Dan Mazeau and Justin Lin that sends the players in a variety of different directions. Having Chris “Ludacris” Bridges and Tyrese Gibson deal with an explosion setup in Rome gives the pair the chance to continue their roles as the bickering buddies.  The fist fight between them is as useless as an appearance by Pete Davidson as an arms dealer. His role is for comic relief but that is redundant since the entire script is laughable.  This franchise has gone from a tale anchored in reality dealing with street racing to a point where the action sequences are more unbelievable than the Coyote’s efforts to catch the Roadrunner. A certain degree of improbability is acceptable in a massive action film but eventually the laws of physics trump everything else.  Buried under all of the celebrity appearances and endless chatter about family are some high-octane driving sequences. They go beyond the levels of absurdity but that has become the trademark of the franchise. Those who have a need for speed will get a big ride once again.  It is never a good thing to give away major spoilers in a review but in this case, there is no getting around it. “Fast X” is just a 141-minute commercial to promote the next film in the franchise. After long driving scenes, numerous fights and even a car race, “Fast X” ends with numerous cliffhangers.  The lack of effort by everyone involved leaves “Fast X” as such a disappointment, it should have been called “The Fast and the Frivolous.”  Movie review  Fast X  Grade: C-  Cast: Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Chis “Ludacris” Bridges, Tyrese Gibson, Jason Momoa, Charlize Theron, Sung Kang, Brie Larson, John Cena.

"explosion","2023-04-01","15:00:00","{""Olton"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T11:02:26","LITTLEFIELD — Butterflies hummed around Ashton Lucio's stomach as the New Home baseball team headed north Thursday.  Seven months removed from tearing his ACL in football, Lucio, who was cleared for full participation earlier this week, was being handed the ball to start the Leopards' Region I-2A quarterfinal series against Olton.  The nerves were even worse when the Leopards got to Littlefield. Lucio began to warm up, thinking he had about 40 pitches, maybe a couple of innings, for his return to the baseball field. He had no idea what to expect.  Brazos Beck, who tore his own ACL during football in 2021, helped guide Lucio through the process of coming back from a knee injury.  Lucio and Beck had the same doctor, similar physical therapy. Beck, the senior, is someone Lucio said he looks up to, so he took his words to heart. Having gone through his own return — first to the gridiron, then to the diamond — Beck admitted he didn't know what Lucio would be capable of.  He left being rather impressed.  New Home baseball hopes for another prosperous postseason as Ashton Lucio nears return  ""Like he hadn't even skipped a beat,"" New Home coach Brady Webb said.  Not only did the Leopard offense explode for 42 runs over two games, Lucio pitched a one-hit gem in the first game before Beck took the mound in the second. New Home (26-3-3) walked off the field with a pair of wins — 27-0 and 15-5 — a series sweep and a return trip to the region semifinals.  ""I wasn't really trying to do too much,"" Lucio said. ""I didn't think I was gonna do that good. I thought I might have got pulled maybe in the second inning or so, but I kept the pitch count pretty good and just did my job.""  Lucio didn't exactly have to be at the top of his game Thursday. New Home erupted for a 27-0 victory in the series opener. That included nine extra-base hits from eight different players.  The win, though, was amplified by Lucio's stellar pitching performance. The junior went all five innings, striking out 12 batters, allowing one hit and one hit batsman.  Olton coach Matthew Ingle said he knew Lucio was pitching in his first game of the season against his squad. That's what made it even more impressive.  South Plains high school baseball schedule, results  ""The good part about it for us,"" Ingle said, ""is I don't even think he's clocking his (velocity) where he wants it to be. I think he's gonna pick up another five, six, seven, eight miles an hour, and cool for him. Go get after it.  ""(New Home is) somebody else's problem now and the Lucio kid is someone else's problem now as well.""  In their deepest playoff run in school history, the stage appeared too big at times for the Mustangs (21-7-2). Brody Langford had the lone hit off of Lucio and started the second game with a single. It would take another two innings for Olton to produce a run, a five-run frame that forced New Home starter Logan Addison — who had three hits, including two doubles in the second contest — from the game.  Beck stepped in for Addison, trying to keep the lead. The bases were loaded with one out when Beck took over. Olton got a two-run double from Paul Lopez to make it a 6-5 game, but Beck stopped the bleeding from there. It helped the Leopards provided nine runs in their half of the inning to reclaim the momentum for a 15-5 win.  ""My goal was kind of just throw strikes,"" Beck said. ""I couldn't afford to walk anyone. I just wanted to force him over the middle of the plate and he hit it well, but after that I adjusted and our defense made plays and we hit the ball again. They picked me up after that, so good job on the team for that.""  New Home, which is ranked fifth in the latest Texas High School Baseball Coach Association rankings, advances to play the winner of the series between sixth-ranked Albany and 10th-ranked Hamilton in the region semifinals. Despite the lopsided scores in the first three rounds of the playoffs, Webb has no concerns about his team being ready for whichever team is next.  ""Our boys know exactly what's coming next,"" the New Home head coach said. ""Whoever comes out of Hamilton and Albany is going to be real stinking good. And we're aware of that. We've talked about that really from day one.""  Region I-2A quarterfinal baseball  Game 1: New Home 27, Olton 0 (5)  New Home 357 38 — 27 21 0  Olton 000 00 — 0 1 3  Ashton Lucio.

This Fossil Friday features the gliding reptile Sharovipteryx mirabilis from the Mid Triassic of Central Asia.  Within only two million years of the Mid-Triassic era (about 230-228 million years ago) there was a sudden appearance of a large diversity of gliding and flying reptiles, such as Sharovipteryx with wings on the legs, Mecistotrachelos and the unrelated Kuehneosauridae with a gliding membrane across lateral rib-like projections, Longisquama with long feather-like scales on the back, and the earliest pterosaurs such as Preondactylus with bat-like wings supported by a single enlarged finger.  Considerable Re-Engineering  All these very different solutions for gliding and active flight required considerable re-engineering of the tetrapod body plan, and such biological novelty arguably required new and highly specific genetic code. Such specified information cannot be produced by blind mechanisms and certainly not in such a short window of time of only two million years, which corresponds to just about half the average longevity of a vertebrate species.  Personally, I am quite sympathetic to the dissenting view of my paleontologist colleague Simon Conway Morris, who suggested that evolution does not work through a blind and random mechanism, but rather like a search engine that searches for pre-existing platonic forms in a constrained hyperspace of biological possibilities. However, this would no longer be Darwinian evolution but a highly teleological process and thus a kind of intelligent design combined with platonist idealism as metaphysics.  Whatever the mechanism of design may have been, the abrupt origin of flying reptiles is just one example within a kind of carpet bombing of biological explosions during the Triassic era, when many new orders and families of metazoan animals suddenly appeared after the end-Permian mass extinction event. This has been called the Early Triassic Metazoan Radiation, and includes marine invertebrates (e.g., bivalves and ceratite cephalopods), insects (e.g., coleopterans and dipterans), 15 different families and body plans of marine reptiles (Bechly 2023), as well as the first representatives of modern terrestrial tetrapod taxa that appeared suddenly within a short window of time between 251-240 million years ago (Ezcurra 2010). The latter include the first dinosaurs (Nyasasaurus), the first lizard-relatives (Lepidosauromorpha such as Paliguana), the first croc-relatives (Crurotarsi such as Ctenodiscosaurus), the first mammal-like animals (Mammaliaformes such as Haramiyida), and allegedly the first turtles (Pappochelys) even though this is more dubious (Bechly 2022).  Goal-Directed and Intelligent  The well-known paleontologist Peter Ward, who is an ardent Darwinist and a strong opponent of intelligent design theory, explicitly acknowledged that “the diversity of Triassic animal plans is analogous to the diversity of marine body plans that resulted from the Cambrian Explosion. It also occurred for nearly the same reasons and, as will be shown, was as important for animal life on land as the Cambrian Explosion was for marine animal life” (Ward 2006:160). I totally agree that all these explosions occurred for the same reasons and by the same causes, which must have been goal-directed and intelligent.

Other than Coinbase, renowned cryptocurrency exchange Robinhood is set to list Pepe.  In a circulating tweet, Popular cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has recently launched a countdown on Twitter, but it is still uncertain what it is all about. It may be a sign of an announcement on the exchange’s expansion plans or a prospective listing announcement for PEPE Coin.  Recently, with a subliminal reference to Pepe Coin in a meme, billionaire Elon Musk joined the conversation. This happened a few hours following Musk’s announcement that Linda Yaccarino is Twitter’s new chief executive officer. Following these two events, Pepe users believe that the listing of the frog-themed meme coin must be the subject of the exchange’s upcoming major announcement.  The listing of PEPE Coin is the subject of most tweets in response to the countdown, with different users from the Pepe community excited about the announcements. Based on the one-day gap between the countdown posts, it is expected that the announcement will be made on Thursday, May 18, 2023.  Recently Pepe coin has been a subject of discussion in the cryptocurrency community. There has been a significant increase in the number of unique holders of Pepe, with a total of 112,000 holders observed. Additionally, there has been a daily growth of 1,000 different transactional wallets.  It is worth noting that while the number of addresses sending $PEPE has decreased by 0.2k, the number of addresses receiving $PEPE has increased by 1.6k. This suggests a division in on-chain activity, with more people buying the cryptocurrency than selling it.  Follow us for the latest crypto news!  Since the meme coin was launched, it has increased by 425.2%. Other than Coinbase, renowned cryptocurrency exchange Robinhood is set to list Pepe. As of the time of writing, Pepe has a market cap of $595 million and $315M in the past 24 hours. It is worth noting that the coin has made considerable gains to maintain a 70-rank position on the coin market cap.  Pepe Price Analysis  Pepe is currently trading at $0.000001574 as of the time of writing. Looking at the 4-hour timeframe chart, the net price of Pepe is currently lower than both the 100-day and 50-day Moving Averages. Additionally, the 50-day Moving Average has dropped below the 100-day Moving Average.  This indicates a negative sentiment in the market, with the price trending below the recent average. The fact that the Pepe coin price is below the 50-day and 100-day Moving Averages suggests that the market sentiment is bearish.  The RSI of Pepe is currently showing a downtrend, indicating an increase in selling pressure for the cryptocurrency. As of press time, the RSI stands at 41.82.  [thrive_leads id=""228374""]  Furthermore, based on the MACD chart, the recommended trade is to sell Pepe. This is because the MACD line has dropped below the signal line, and the volume histogram bars have increased below 0 on the chart. Overall Pepe is currently bearish.

Glob. Tubing LLC v. Tenaris Coiled Tubes LLC, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46067 (S.D. Tex. Mar. 17, 2023).1  Background  The Tenaris patents at issue are U.S. Patent Nos. 9,803,256 (""the '256 patent""), 10,378,074 (""the '074 patent""), and 10,378,075 (""the '075 patent""), relating to high performance material for coiled tubing in the oil and gas industry and methods of producing the same.  Southwestern, a former competitor, created and distributed to its customers a ""sales brochure"" describing its CYMAX tubing product. Glob. Tubing, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46067 at *4. Page 30 of the brochure disclosed the carbon content of CYMAX, which overlaps with the carbon content in Defendant's '256 patent. Id. at *4-5. Soon after Tenaris filed for the '256 patent, it obtained a copy of the CYMAX brochure, which was distributed to those at Tenaris working on the '256 patent. Id. at *5. One member of the Tenaris team wrote to the lead inventor, Martin Valdez, ""look at the chemistries (Page 30 for instance for CYMAX 100). This is essentially our chemistry for H5590 (A606HS)."" Id. Valdez sent the brochure to Tenaris's in-house counsel, who forwarded it to outside patent prosecution counsel, but no one provided the CYMAX brochure to the USPTO Id.  Later in prosecution of the '256 patent, in preparing an inventor declaration to overcome an obvious rejection, Valdez wrote to the prosecuting counsel about the CYMAX brochure stating, ""In page 30 of the CYMAX.pdf doc you can see the spec of the CYMAX 100 which was 0.13 - 0.17 Carbon. I am not sure it is a good idea to disclose this document."" Id. at *11-12. The CYMAX brochure was still not provided to the USPTO. Id. at *12.  In prosecuting the two children patents (the '074 and the '075 patents), Tenaris decided to provide the CYMAX brochure to the USPTO, however, in a way where the brochure was dissected into five parts with multiple pages removed, including page 30 showing the carbon content of CYMAX. Id. at *14. Tenaris also changed inventorship of the child patents so that available prior art was no longer considered, as the prior art had previously rendered the patents obvious. Id.  District Court  Inequitable Conduct of the '256 Patent  A breach of duty of candor and good faith, coupled with intent to deceive, constitutes inequitable conduct. Id. at *7. To establish inequitable conduct, clear and convincing evidence are required to show that the applicant (1) misrepresented or omitted information material to patentability, and (2) did so with specific intent to mislead or deceive the PTO. Id. Specific intent to deceive must be the single most reasonable inference able to draw from the evidence. Id. at *9.  For materiality of the omitted CYMAX brochure, the Court found that ""there can be little doubt that the CYMAX brochure satisfies even the strictest criteria,"" as one of the inventors recognized that the brochure contains ""essentially our chemistry."" Id. at *10. A finding of materiality is further supported by Tenaris's act of removing page 30 when it later submitted the brochure. Id. at *10-11.  For intent to mislead or deceive, after reviewing the statement made by Valdez, the lead inventor, to the prosecuting counsel about the CYMAX brochure, the Court wrote that ""[r]arely do courts come across such stark evidence of the intent fork of inequitable conduct."" Id. at *12. The Court found that an intent to deceive is the most reasonable inference from the evidence. Id.  In response to Tenaris' argument that Global should not make arguments inconsistent with its invalidity contention, the Court ruled that invalidity contentions should not estop a party from later taking a different position, especially in such a case in which so much has been revealed in discovery. Id. at *12-13.  '074 and '075 Child Patents Unenforceable  For inequitable conduct related to a parent patent to render a child patent unenforceable, the inequitable conduct at issue needs to have an ""immediate and necessary relation"" to the children patents. Id. at 6.  The Court found that the ""immediate and necessary relation"" between the '256 patent and its children was established not only by patentee's terminal disclaimer in the children patents, but also in actions taken during the prosecution of the children. Id. at *13-14. Tenaris' failure to submit the full original CYMAX brochure and its change of the inventors to disable relevant prior art that would have rendered the patents obvious ""clearly show the relation between the '256 patent and the '074 and '75 children patents."" Id. at *14.  Take-aways  As the Court noted, ""the remedy for inequitable conduct is the 'atomic bomb' of patent law,"" because ""inequitable conduct regarding any single claim renders the entire patent unenforceable."" Id. at *8. And as also shown in this case, the ""fruit of the poisonous tree"" doctrine may mean the atomic bomb blows up related patents as well.  Although the court tightened the standards for finding both intent and materiality in Therasense to avoid overuse of this doctrine of inequitable conduct, patent practitioners should remain vigilant and watch out for themselves and their clients. The duty of candor and good faith is on every individual associated with the filing and prosecution of the patent. 37 C.F.R. §1.56. Patent practitioners may need to educate their clients about this duty when necessary. As advised by the Federal Circuit, ""when a question of materiality is close, a patent applicant should err on the side of disclosure."" LNP Eng'g Plastics, Inc. v. Miller Waste Mills, Inc., 275 F.3d 1347, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).  Footnote  1.

Anita Ferguson, 38, was settling in for a night of footy and dinner with her children in the backyard of their Campbelltown home where they'd stay warm around a fire pit. But in a split second, everything changed for the mum-of-six when the flick of a match left her screaming in pain.  ""As she's gone to throw the tiniest bit of petrol on the fire just to get it going, it exploded and just engulfed her,"" her brother Mark Ferguson, 37, told Yahoo News Australia. ""It's gone up and burned her arm, her face, her shoulder, chest, and all around her neck as well. She's got the high end of second-degree burns on 30 per cent of her body.""  Anita Ferguson (pictured far right with sister Jenna) suffered second-degree burns after her backyard fire pit exploded in her face (left). Source: Supplied  Son responds to mum's screams  Anita's 15-year-old son, Bryson, responded to his mum's piercing screams, rushing outside to find her on fire. Her other five children — including two foster kids — were also home at the time.  ""He's just turned around and ran to the bathroom to get the shower ready for her,"" Mark said. ""She's very lucky that she was alert enough to close her eyes and mouth because once you get burns into your eyes and mouth, it then truly turns catastrophic.""  The 38-year-old disability support worker stayed in the shower until paramedics arrived and transported her to Concord Hospital, some 50 minutes from their home. Paramedics ""treated her, wrapped her and addressed her pain,"" Mark said. ""She was in excruciating pain"".  Doctors had to treat the 38-year-old with 'artificial' skin to replace her own which was burnt off in the fire. Source: Supplied  Family devastated by extent of injuries  Anita, a single mum, spent the next four nights in the hospital where she underwent surgery before eventually being released on Tuesday. But the mum, whose marriage broke down last year, has a long three months ahead of her with therapy as her skin begins to heal.  ""She's got staples all down her arm and across the top of her face going into a skull,"" Mark explained, detailing the ""artificial skin"" doctors have had to use on his sister. ""She's so prone to infections right now that everyone going near her has to sanitise. The kids can't hug their mum without going and sanitising or having a shower first.""  Story continues  Anita (middle) with her children Bryson, 15 (bottom right), Braydon, 19 (top right), Blake, 17 (top left) and Karli, 9 (bottom left). Source: Supplied  Anita's children — aged 2 to 19 — are ""absolutely devastated,"" with her youngest daughter, Carly, ""really scared and concerned [about] what's going to happen with mum"".  Mark said Anita was worried about how she'd look. ""I'm never going to look the same,"" she told him. Doctors were ""unable to comment on any permanent scarring at this stage,"" her brother said.  Money raised to help during long recovery  Mark and his sister, Anita's twin Jenna, have stepped in to help look after the kids while the 38-year-old learns to adjust to her new, temporary way of life. The siblings have set up a GoFundMe page to help cover the cost of bills while she recovers at home.  Anita daughter Karlie is 'scared and concerned' about her mum's recovery. Source: Supplied  ""The recovery, we don't know what it fully looks like,"" Mark said. ""They're predicting three to six months before she can return to work. She only works 15 hours a week, but those 15 hours — that $400 she earns — is what keeps the wheels in the house turning.""  Cooler weather warning: 'Remain cautious'  As we move into the cooler months, the family say this is a lesson for everyone.  ""It's not the time to become complacent,"" Mark warned. ""We're all using our fireplaces, heaters, and fire pits in the backyard. It's time to remain cautious so that no other family has to go through what they're going through.""

"explosion","2023-05-18","19:00:00","{""NewOrleans"", ""Louisiana"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T16:13:43","Marc Berman  Special to The Post  Santaluces’ esteemed football coach Hector Clavijo III sat in his office Thursday night, glued to his laptop that showed a detailed weather and lightning map.  Santaluces’ spring game against South Broward was already delayed by rain and lightning but Clavijo noticed something on the map. “It’s passed us,"" Clavijo declared. “We’re playing this game.""  And so the Chiefs did, 90 minutes late, as a rain-soaked defensive struggle ensued with each team mounting only one touchdown in four quarters.  With the second half played on running time, South Broward notched the scoreboard win 7-6 — the difference a successful conversion.  With the spring game behind him, Clavijo can continue vying to keep his promise of putting Palm Beach County football on the map in his second season.  Clavijo, who led Champagnat Catholic (Miami) to state titles in 2017, 2019 and 2020 before the school's closure in 2022, raised eyebrows among some longtime PBC coaches in December when he tweeted his goal to put Palm Beach County football ""on the map."" Clavijo isn’t backing down.  In his first season of 2022, Clavijo’s Chiefs went from a horrible, one-win season to the district title.  Now he’s aiming for grander things for 2023’s campaign that starts officially in August against powerhouse Pahokee. The program also has scheduled a regular-season game in New Orleans against John Curtis, a top-50 program.  ""It’s going to be a big explosion of success next year,’’ Clavijo said. “I think the team is better overall. We have a lot of really good pieces returning with experience.""  Free:Check out our weekly high school sports newsletter!  Spring football is here!Schedules for Palm Beach County  Recent:Congratulations Class of 2023! Santaluces High School graduation photos  Winning three state titles in Miami has perhaps spoiled Clavijo, who still looked at last season’s turnaround as “a little disappointing” because they were knocked out by Stoneman Douglas 48-44 in the first round of state regionals.  “As a program, I thought it was a success going from 1-9 to 8-2, but not winning a playoff game?"" Clavijo said. “For me, not going to a state championship game was a little disappointing. For us that was the goal the entire year. It’s not what we wanted but a lot of the kids who come back have a chip on their shoulder. They know what it’s like to win now. So it won’t be a new thing for them. That’s why we’ll be a mentally tougher team this year.""  Cardinal Newman coach Jack Daniels was among those most offended by Clavijo’s perceived arrogance, tweeting that Palm Beach County is already on the football map.  Clavijo said his barometer is different than Daniels’, pointing to a dearth of state champions. The last PBC school to win a state football title was Dwyer, 10 years ago.  “That’s a problem with Palm Beach County,"" Clavijo said. “If we were on the map, there would be state champions teams coming out of Palm Beach County. There hasn’t been, hasn’t been a champion since Dwyer, however long that was. That’s what I meant about putting them on the map. Bringing back championships. That’s my goal for the county.""  On Clavijo’s greaseboard is a list of 45 colleges. All of them have visited the Lantana campus since last season, including these four weeks of spring practice. Penn State, Iowa, Tennessee, Miami, Syracuse, Pittsburgh and Northwestern highlight the board.  Because of his many college connections gained in Miami, he claims to have helped other PBC programs.  “I’m now a county resident,"" said Clavijo, who moved with his wife to Loxahatchee. “I live here too. There’s never been this influx of universities coming. They ask me where to go. Some of them typically don’t recruit this area. I’m doing my part in that.""  If Clavijo seems brassy, he may have a right to be.  As one college scout said Thursday at the spring game: “He’s great. He gets more out of less. He’s able to get down to their level and relate to them.""  Santaluces still must figure out its quarterback situation and the issue festered during the spring game. Competing for the job are freshman Chris Siska and Dwyer transfer Shyeia Deveau, who was not permitted to play spring ball for Santaluces.  Siska showed his youth Thursday, picked off twice. Santaluces’ lone score came on a touchdown reception by Jamar Browder.  Clavijo knows the Chiefs' strength is defense. “Our defense played great,"" Clavijo said. “Defense will hold the team down next year.""  Santaluces will boast a dynamic running back in Derrick Williams. But replacing the redheaded gunslinger in quarterback Will Prichard, who is already taking classes at Arkansas State but showed up for the spring game, is the mystery.  “Our biggest question mark is who’s going to take the helm at quarterback,"" Clavijo said. “Once you get that figured out, the sky is the limit.""  The Chiefs boast two elite defenders in seniors defensive back Amir Gibson and defensive end Kedrick Burley, who are getting scholarship offers. And then there’s defensive back Anatay Smith, who had two picks in the spring game.  The 5-9 Gibson has an offer from Western Carolina and is drawing interest from Ivy League and Patriot League schools, as his GPA is 4.2. Gibson was a state qualifier in weightlifting.  “The kid is phenomenal — hard-nosed tough physical specimen, 3% body fat,"" Clavijo said. “Strongest pound to pound in the state of Florida.""  Burley, Clavijo says, is “unblockable, the most dominant player at his position in the county."" He’s sifting through offers from Western Kentucky, Illinois State, Western Carolina, Coastal Carolina, Middle Tennessee State, North Carolina AT&T and Fordham, among others.  While Clavijo was forced to move because of his wife’s job, he has no regrets. The facilities at Santaluces are significantly more plush than at his Miami school which struggled to find a home football field.  “This is the Hilton — I was at the Motel 6,"" Clavijo said. “We practiced on a non-regulation field. Our field-goal posts were palm trees. Our weight room was outside. I got two weight rooms here — with a roof. Five fields, a stadium.""  Facilities aside, Clavijo knows it’s about the work, especially in the offseason. He cites the key is putting Sanaluces in all sorts of offseason competitions — passing leagues, 7-on-7s — across the state.  “The biggest key was instilling the culture of discipline and winning,"" Clavijo said as the rain fell. “Anywhere you go in Palm Beach County, you’re going to see our face. That’s how they do it in Dade County. Football is 365 down there. I’m trying to bring that here.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wYWxtYmVhY2hwb3N0LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9zcG9ydHMvaGlnaC1zY2hvb2wvZm9vdGJhbGwvMjAyMy8wNS8xOS9zYW50YWx1Y2VzLWZvb3RiYWxsLWhlY3Rvci1jbGF2aWpvLWV4cGVjdHMtYmlnLWV4cGxvc2lvbi1vZi1zdWNjZXNzLzcwMjM1ODQ1MDA3L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Ammonium nitrate, which is used as fertilizer, can also be used to create explosives and was a key component in the homemade bomb used in the 1995 attack on the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City.  The chemical was shipped by train from Cheyenne, Wyoming last month but when it arrived in the Mojave Desert two weeks later, its holding car was empty and the nitrate was gone. Dyno Nobel, the company responsible for shipping the ammonium nitrate is a leader in commercial explosives and filed a report with the federal National Response Center (NRC) on May 10 and an investigation is currently underway.  Advertisement  The Federal Railroad Administration, the California Public Utilities Commission, Union Pacific, and Dyno Nobel are looking into the disappearance, and the railcar is being transported back to Wyoming to undergo a thorough inspection.  It is unclear how or when the chemical disappeared during transit, but Dyno Nobel told KQED News, “The railcar was sealed when it left the Cheyenne facility, and the seals were still intact when it arrived in Saltdale. The initial assessment is that a leak through the bottom gate on the railcar may have developed in transit.”  Advertisement  Given that the chemical can be used to make highly explosive bombs, the loss of such an enormous amount of explosive material is highly concerning, and Stan Blake, a former Wyoming lawmaker and retired train conductor told Cowboy State Daily News it wouldn’t have been difficult to drain the train car of the material. Blake told the outlet that each car has two or three sections with a gate at the bottom, and said, “You can use up a big bar and open that gate and it’ll pour out.”  Dyno Nobel did not immediately respond to Gizmodo’s request for comment but said in a statement to Cowboy State Daily News that the railcar had made multiple stops on its journey and that there is a team working to investigate how the supposed leak occurred. “We take this matter seriously and will work to understand how it happened and how it can be prevented from occurring again,” the spokesperson said.  Advertisement  This is the latest in a spate of train mishaps that resulted in toxic chemical spills, fires, and mass damage to towns as trains in the Midwest have derailed several times in the last six months. In one case, a spill in East Palestine, Ohio caused widespread panic among residents who were quickly evacuated due to the extreme toxicity of the chemicals spilled.  A Union Pacific spokesperson told Cowboy State Daily News that the loss of the ammonium nitrate is not something to be overly concerned about. “Assuming the loss occurred during transport, the release of the fertilizer to the ground beneath railroad tracks should pose no risk to public health or the environment.”  Advertisement  David King, a Campbell County emergency management coordinator, told the outlet that it isn’t likely the chemical was stolen and said he doesn’t believe it was gathered to be used to create illegal explosives. “If I was going to make an IED [improvised explosive device], ammonia nitrate wouldn’t be my choice of explosive,” he told the outlet, adding, “It’s not a ‘set your hair on fire’ situation.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vZ2l6bW9kby5jb20vZHluby1ub2JlbC10cmFpbi1leHBsb3NpdmUtYW1tb25pdW0tZGlzYXBwZWFycy1tb2phdmUtMTg1MDQ1NjMzMdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"explosion","2019-04-18","Not Discerned","{""Knoxville"", ""Tennessee"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T00:20:00","GM recalls 1 million SUVs over defect that could cause air bag to rupture  More than 33 million people in the United States are driving vehicles that contain a potentially deadly threat: Airbag inflators that in rare cases can explode in a collision and spew shrapnel.  Few of them know it.  And because of a dispute between federal safety regulators and an airbag parts manufacturer, they aren't likely to find out anytime soon.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is demanding that the manufacturer, ARC Automotive of Knoxville, Tennessee, recall 67 million inflators that could explode with such force as to blow apart a metal canister and expel shrapnel. But ARC is refusing to do so, setting up a possible court fight with the agency.  The NHTSA argues that the recall is justified because two people have been killed in the United States and Canada and at least seven others have been injured by ARC's inflators. The explosions, which first occurred in 2009, have continued as recently as this year.  The NHTSA tentatively concluded, after an investigation that has lasted eight years, that the inflators are defective. The agency's documents show that the inflators date from at least the 2002 model year to January 2018, when ARC installed equipment on its manufacturing lines that could detect potential safety problems.  One of those who died was Marlene Beaudoin, a 40-year-old mother of 10 from Michigan's Upper Peninsula who was struck by metal fragments when her 2015 Chevrolet Traverse SUV was involved in a minor crash in 2021. She and four of her sons had been on their way to get ice cream. The sons were not hurt.  Two viewpoints  ARC maintains that no safety defect exists, that the NHTSA's demand is based on a hypothesis rather than technical conclusions and that the agency has no authority to order a parts manufacturer to carry out recalls, which ARC contends are the responsibility of automakers.  In a letter to the NHTSA, ARC said no automaker has found a defect common to all 67 million inflators and no root cause has been identified in the inflator ruptures.  ""ARC believes they resulted from random 'one-off' manufacturing anomalies that were properly addressed by vehicle manufacturers through lot-specific recalls,"" the letter said.  In a statement, the NHTSA indicated that both ARC and automakers are responsible for recalls and that it can seek a recall from a parts maker that supplies multiple automakers.  The next step is for the NHTSA to issue a final ruling on whether the inflators are defective, then hold a public hearing. It potentially could take ARC to court to seek a recall order. The NHTSA would not say when or whether any of this will happen.  The vehicles possibly involved  In the meantime, owners of vehicles made by at least a dozen automakers - Chevrolet, Buick, GMC, Ford, Toyota, Stellantis, Volkswagen, Audi, BMW, Porsche, Hyundai and Kia - are left to wonder anxiously whether their vehicles contain driver or front passenger inflators made by ARC. Some vehicles have ARC inflators on both sides.  The Wall Street Journal, citing records from the eight-year federal probe, says at least 50 models are involved ""spanning 15 automotive brands."" The Journal says it's identified at least 6.8 million vehicles that automakers say have the potentially defective part.  Because ARC supplies inflators that are included in other manufacturers' airbags, there's no easy way for vehicle owners to determine whether their inflators are made by ARC. Neither the NHTSA nor ARC nor the automakers have released a full list of affected models.  The standoff with ARC has sent automakers struggling to find out just how many of their vehicles contain the inflators. The auto manufacturers are also asking the NHTSA whether they must start doing recalls.  Automakers know many of the models affected. But many say they're still gathering information from later model years to determine which vehicles contain the affected inflators.  ""We are still investigating,"" said Maria Buczkowski, a spokesperson for Ford. ""We have not had any ARC airbag inflators rupture in the field.""  James Bell, a Kia spokesman, said, ""We do not have a final count on vehicles that were built with ARC inflators, but the team is collecting the data.""  Toyota confirmed that some of its vehicles have ARC inflators but wouldn't comment further.  Other automakers said they were trying to find a cause and were working with the government, or didn't respond to requests from The Associated Press for information.  The NHTSA contends that byproducts from welding during manufacturing can clog a vent inside the inflator canister that's designed to enable gas to escape to fill air bags quickly in a crash. Pressure can build to the point where the canister is blown apart.  Michael Brooks, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety, called on the NHTSA and the automakers to release a list of affected models.  ""Customers, I think, have a right to know if there's a potential defect in their car, particularly if it's sitting a few inches from their chest and can explode,"" Brooks said.  The situation, he said, is reminiscent of the early stages of the Takata air bag inflator recalls in 2001. It took years for all the affected vehicle models to be announced.  Comparison with the past  Both ARC and Takata used ammonium nitrate to inflate air bags. Takata's situation was more dangerous, Brooks said, because in its inflators, the chemical could deteriorate over time when exposed to high heat and humidity. Unlike Takata, ARC uses ammonium nitrate only as a secondary chemical to inflate air bags. ARC's problem appears to derive instead from a manufacturing defect.  From 2017 to 2022, the ARC problems triggered seven small recalls from automakers. Last week, on the same day the NHTSA announced its action against ARC, General Motors announced the recall of nearly 1 million more.  The company said it's recalling certain 2014 through 2017 GMC Acadia, Chevy Traverse and Buick Enclave SUVs because the ARC inflators can explode. The recall came after GM was told this year that the driver's air bag ruptured in a 2017 Traverse. GM, which says it doesn't know what caused the inflator to explode, has hired an engineering firm to help investigate.  ""We disagree with NHTSA's new sweeping request when extensive field testing has found no inherent defect,"" ARC said in a statement.  While the recall demand is being sorted out, Brooks of the Center for Auto Safety recommends that owners of vehicles from the 12 affected brands insist that dealers disclose whether their particular vehicle contains an ARC inflator.  ""The more customers who complain, the more pressure that puts on the manufacturers,"" he said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYmFnLWluZmxhdG9ycy1wb3RlbnRpYWwtZXhwbG9zaW9ucy1uaHRzYS1hcmMtYXV0b21vdGl2ZS_SAVxodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9haXJiYWctaW5mbGF0b3JzLXBvdGVudGlhbC1leHBsb3Npb25zLW5odHNhLWFyYy1hdXRvbW90aXZlLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Multiple YouTube accounts claim the video documents Pooram festival in Kerala.  Context  On May 16, an explosion occurred at an illegal firecracker factory in West Bengal's Purba Medinipur district that left nine people dead. The Indian Express reported that the illegal factory was run by a man named Krishnapada Bag out of his house where large quantities of suspected gunpowder were reportedly kept.  Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has ordered an inquiry by the Crime Investigation Department (CID) into the incident. The opposition's demand that the case be taken over by the National Investigation Agency (NIA); which included a plea filed by West Bengal Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Suvendu Adhikari was denied by Calcutta High Court on May 18.  Amid this, a video of a large scale explosion across a crops field has been going viral on social media, claiming to show the firecracker factory blast. The video shows huge plumes of smoke rising from the explosion site, and a man momentarily running at the beginning of the clip. The clip went viral with captions in Bengali and English. BJP leader Naveen Kumar Jindal also shared the video on May 18, targeting Banerjee saying, ""Mamata Bano is not bothered at all."" However, he has since deleted the tweet.  In Fact  On May 18, the West Bengal Police debunked the claim tweeting, “This video is being circulated by some visual media channels & in social media as the blast. Actually it is the visual of Pooram festival in Kerala. #WBP appeals to all to refrain from circulation of fake news and warns strict action against the violators.”  We looked for Pooram celebration videos from Kerala and came across several uploads of the same video on multiple platforms throughout 2022. One of the toldest uploads on YouTube is from a Kerala travel vlog called “Youtube Peedika” dated March 18, 2022, with over 87.5k views and 4k likes. It is a YouTube short titled “Palakkad Kavassery Vedikkettu at its best.” Kavassery is a village in Kerala, and vedikkettu translates to fireworks.  We also looked for other videos of the 2022 Kavassery Pooram fireworks and found the same visuals uploaded by a channel called WhAtEvEr TV. The video had been uploaded with the title: ""Kerala Fireworks Festival, Firecracker Festival in Kerala."" We also came across some longer videos by other accounts claiming they were from the 2022 festival celebrations in Kerala.  While Logically Facts was unable to independently verify the origin and location of the visuals seen in the viral video, it is clear that the video predates the explosion in West Bengal.  The Verdict  An old video has been incorrectly shared as visuals of the illegal firecracker factory blast in West Bengal's Egra in May 2023. The video has been available on the internet since March 2022, and therefore cannot be footage of the recent blast. Therefore, we have marked this claim false.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxvZ2ljYWxseS5haS9mYWN0Y2hlY2tzL2xpYnJhcnkvOGQzOTNiZmbSAUBodHRwczovL3d3dy5sb2dpY2FsbHkuYWkvZmFjdGNoZWNrcy9saWJyYXJ5LzhkMzkzYmZmP2hzX2FtcD10cnVl?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Universal Pictures  Exploding cars may be entertaining to watch in action films. But cars erupting into fireballs when they crash or tumble down a mountainside is one of the most common and scientifically preposterous movie tropes.  With the release of ""Fast X,"" the latest in the ""Fast & Furious"" franchise, on May 19 2023, it's time to debunk the myth of the exploding car.  Advertisement  Cars never explode under these circumstances and rarely catch fire. That's unless you were unfortunate enough to be driving a Ford Pinto or Chevrolet Malibu in the 1970s. Both manufacturers cut corners in the production process and the result was poorly designed fuel tanks that were vulnerable to catching alight, often trapping the occupants inside.  Even when racing driver Romain Grosjean crashed at 140 mph (225 kph) at the 2020 Bahrain Grand Prix, his vehicle caught fire but did not explode.  Fuel vapor is only explosive in air (which is 20 percent oxygen) and when under pressure. Liquid fuel isn't explosive but the vapor can catch fire. Vapor can escape from the fuel tank when you unscrew the cap. But tanks have a system in which the pressure is relieved without venting the vapor. A full fuel tank is safer than you might think since there is no air inside it and so no oxygen.  In fact, liquid fuel can be difficult to ignite even when it comes into contact with a flame.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC5ob3dzdHVmZndvcmtzLmNvbS9ob2xseXdvb2QtY2FyLWV4cGxvc2lvbi5odG3SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"explosion","2023-05-18","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T09:45:00","The last super-eruption at Yellowstone volcano, which occurred 631,000 years ago, was not one huge explosion. Instead, new research suggests it was a series of eruptions or multiple vents spewing volcanic material in rapid succession.  According to the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) Yellowstone Volcano Observatory 2022 Annual Report, published May 4, fieldwork over the past year has provided new geological evidence that ""the formation of Yellowstone Caldera was much more complex than previously thought."" A caldera is a large crater that forms after the collapse of a volcano following an eruption.  Yellowstone is one of the world's biggest volcanic systems. It sits above one of Earth's ""hotspots"" — areas in the mantle where hot plumes rise and form volcanoes on the crust above. It has produced three caldera-forming eruptions in the past 3 million years: the Huckleberry Ridge Tuff eruption, 2.1 million years ago; the Mesa Falls eruption, 1.3 million years ago; and the Lava Creek eruption, 631,000 years ago.  What are super-eruptions?  The Huckleberry Ridge Tuff and Lava Creek events are considered super-eruptions because they expelled over 240 cubic miles (1,000 cubic kilometers) of material. The latter was responsible for the formation of the Yellowstone caldera. Mesa Falls erupted 67 cubic m (280 cubic km) of material, so — while still about 10 times bigger than the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens — is not considered a super-eruption.  Previous research has shown that the Lava Creek super-eruption was not out of the blue; deposits at the Sour Creek Dome region east of the national park suggest that the giant blast was preceded by at least one eruption. Ignimbrite (volcanic rock formed via the deposits of the hot mix of material ejected during an eruption) found at the site had completely cooled before the main, mapped Lava Creek eruption took place.  To better understand the timeline of the eruption, scientists spent 2022 remapping and collecting samples at Sour Creek Dome.  ""It had always been known that there were at least two geological units [a volume of rock distinct from those surrounding it] from the eruption, and it was thought that there was little to no time gap between them,"" Michael Poland, scientist-in-charge at the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory, told Live Science in an email. ""Now, we think there are more units. And we're just not sure what the time gap might have been, if any.""  So far, the team has found four previously unrecognized ignimbrite units at Sour Creek, suggesting at least four eruptive pulses. They also found two structures that appear to be eruptive vents, which may have been the sources of these rocks.  ""That could mean either several vents were active and/or there was time separation between the eruptions,"" Poland said. ""But we don't yet have the data we need to answer those questions yet.""  In 2020, scientists found the Huckleberry Ridge Tuff eruption — which ejected more than twice the amount of volcanic material as Lava Creek did — was also a phased event. Analysis of rocks at the site suggests there were three separate eruptions, with weeks to months between the first two, and years to decades between the second and third.  Yellowstone volcano is not expected to erupt anytime soon. However, the finding that the Lava Creek eruption may have followed a similar pattern to that of the Huckleberry Ridge Tuff eruption could give an idea of what to expect if and when Yellowstone does blow. ""These major caldera-forming eruptions might not be single events at Yellowstone, but instead have multiple phases,"" Poland said.  Researchers at the volcano now plan to carry out detailed examinations of the newly discovered units and the boundaries between them. This will allow them to paint a more detailed picture of what the Lava Creek eruption looked like — and maybe even what triggered it.  Copyright 2023 LiveScience, a Future company.

This incident caused a great deal of worry in the Kremlin about Russia’s inability to defence important infrastructure on the peninsula, according to a report from the British intelligence.  A train was derailed in Simferopol on Thursday, blocking the only connection with Sevastopol Sea Port, where the Russian Black Sea Fleet is stationed.  The railway management explained the incident was a result of “third party interference”.  Russia repaired the railway line very quickly, but the incident did cause a delay with supplies, potentially interfering with the delivery of Kalibr cruise missiles to the Black Sea Fleet, the British intelligence notes.  “Any sabotage in this sensitive area will further increase the Kremlin’s concerns about its ability to protect other key infrastructure in Crimea. The peninsula retains a vital psychological and logistical role in enabling Russia’s war in Ukraine,” the report mentions.  On the next day after the incident near Simferopol, information surfaced that on Friday a UAV had crashed in the Dzhankoi district near Solone Ozero railway station.  No damage was caused to the railway, but it traffic was halted, as reported by a Russian Telegram channel.  The crash of the UAV left a lot of debris. Bomb specialists are working on the scene.

"explosion","2023-05-17","Not Discerned","{""Stockholm"", ""Stockholm"", ""Sweden""}","2023-05-19T11:04:42","In the latest issue of the journal Nature, astronomers from Stockholm University reveal the origin of a thermonuclear supernova explosion. Strong emission lines of helium and the first detection of such a supernova in radio waves show that the exploding white dwarf star had a helium-rich companion.  Researchers from Stockholm University have discovered a thermonuclear supernova’s origin traced to a helium-rich companion star of a white dwarf. This first-ever detection of a supernova in radio waves sheds light on the nature and processes leading to Type Ia supernovae, crucial for measuring the universe’s expansion. The finding helps resolve the long-standing question about the process leading to the explosion of a white dwarf star and the nature of its progenitor, identified here as a helium star that had lost much of its material just prior to the white dwarf’s explosion.    Supernovae of Type Ia are important for astronomers since they are used to measure the expansion of the Universe. However, the origin of these explosions has remained an open question. While it is established that the explosion is that of a compact white dwarf star somehow accreting too much matter from a companion star, the exact process and the nature of the progenitor are not known. The new discovery of supernova SN 2020eyj established that the companion star was a helium star that had lost much of its material just prior to the explosion of the white dwarf.    Artist impression of the double star system with a compact white dwarf star accreting matter from a helium-rich donor companion, surrounded by dense and dusty circumstellar material. It was the interaction of the exploded star and the material left over from this companion that gave rise to the strong radio signal and the conspicuous helium lines in the optical spectra of SN 2020eyj. Credit: Adam Makarenko/W. M. Keck Observatory  “Once we saw the signatures of strong interaction with the material from the companion we tried to also detect it in radio emission,” explains Erik Kool, post-doc at the Department of Astronomy at Stockholm University and lead author of the paper. “The detection in radio is the first one of a Type Ia supernova – something astronomers have tried to do for decades.”  Supernova 2020eyj was discovered by the Zwicky Transient Facility camera on Palomar mountain, where the Oskar Klein Centre at Stockholm University are members.  “The Nordic Optical telescope on La Palma was fundamental for following up this supernova,” says Professor Jesper Sollerman at the Department of Astronomy and co-author of the paper.  “As were spectra from the large Keck telescope on Hawai’i that immediately revealed the very unusual helium-dominated material around the exploded star.”  “This is clearly a very unusual Type Ia supernova, but still related to the ones we use to measure the expansion of the universe,” adds Joel Johansson from the Department of Physics.  “While normal Type Ia supernovae appear to always explode with the same brightness, this supernova tells us that there are many different pathways to a white dwarf star explosion,” he adds.

"explosion","2022-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T17:01:32","Throughout recorded history, humans have looked up at the night sky and witnessed the major astronomical events known as a “supernova.” The name, still used by astronomers, referred to the belief that these bursts of light in the “firmament” signaled the birth of a “new star.” With the birth of telescopes and modern astronomy, we have since learned that supernovae are what occur at the end of a star’s lifecycle. At this point, when a star has exhausted its hydrogen and helium fuel, it experiences gravitational collapse at its center.  This leads to a tremendous explosion that can be seen billions of light-years distant, releasing tremendous amounts of energy and blowing the star’s outer layers off. Thanks to an international team of astronomers led by the University of Southhampton, the most powerful cosmic explosion has been confirmed! The stellar explosion, AT2021lwx, took place about 8 billion light-years away in the constellation Vulpecula and was over ten times brighter than any supernova ever observed and 100 times brighter than all the stars in the Milky Way combined!  The team consisted of astronomers from the University of Southampton’s School of Physics and Astronomy, the CAS Key Laboratory of Optical Astronomy, the CSIS Institute of Space Sciences, the DTU National Space Institute, the European Southern Observatory (ESO), the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias (IAC), the Institut d’Astrophysique de Paris (IAP), the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF), the Institute of Space Studies of Catalonia (IEEC), and multiple universities and institutes. Their findings were shared in a study published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.  Artist view of a supernova explosion. Credit: NASA  AT2021lwx was first detected in 2020 by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) in California. It was subsequently detected by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Hawaii and is still being observed by a global network of telescopes. This makes AT2021lwx a record-setting supernova since most others have only been visible to astronomers for a few months. In addition to outshining other supernovae on record by a factor of 10, it is also three times as bright as any tidal disruption event – when a star is consumed by a supermassive black hole (SMBH).  The record for the brightest explosion is currently held by GRB221009A, an unusually bright and long-lasting gamma-ray burst observed last year that took place 2.4 billion light-years from Earth in the constellation Sagitta. While GRB221009A was brighter than AT2021lwx, it lasted for just a fraction of the time (10 hours), meaning the overall energy released by the latter is far greater. While the supernova has been observed for three years, the scale of the explosion was not known until now. Said lead researcher Dr. Philip Wiseman, a Research Fellow at the University of Southampton:  “We came upon this by chance, as it was flagged by our search algorithm when we were searching for a type of supernova. Most supernovae and tidal disruption events only last for a couple of months before fading away. For something to be bright for two plus years was immediately very unusual.”  As part of their investigation, the team consulted data collected by the ZTF and ATLAS observatories and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). Further observations were made with the Neil Gehrels Swift space telescope, the ESO’s New Technology Telescope (NTT) in Chile, and the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) in Spain. This provided data in the optical, X-ray, ultraviolet (UV), and near- and mid-infrared (NIR and MIR) wavelengths. Tomás E. Müller Bravo, an ICE-CSIC and IEEC postdoctoral researcher, was the Principal Investigator of the GTC proposal. As she indicated:  “Given the uniqueness of this event, we observed it at different wavelengths with the aim of understanding its nature. In particular, our successful proposal to Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) allowed us to observe the presence and absence of different spectral lines, and compare these to those from other known transients to better understand the physical processes behind this bright source.”  This artist’s impression depicts a rapidly spinning supermassive black hole surrounded by an accretion disc.

Kornmesser  “It is really shocking when you find a transient, check its brightness, and you realize it is an order of magnitude brighter than any other supernova,” added co-author Lluís Galbany, a researcher from the ICE-CSIC and member of the IEEC. “When our collaborators told us the existence of this transient, we rapidly prepared a fast-turnaround proposal to observe the transient with the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC).”  There are several theories about what caused it, but the team believes the most likely explanation is that an SMBH violently disrupted an extremely large cloud of gas or dust. As a portion of the cloud was consumed, it sent shockwaves through the rest of the remnants and the accretion disk surrounding the black hole. This theory is based on the fact that the only things as bright as AT2021lwx are the active nuclei of galaxies (quasars), where the SMBH has a constant flow of gas falling onto them at high velocity. It is rare for such events to be witnessed, and nothing on this scale has ever been seen before.  “With a quasar, we see the brightness flickering up and down over time,” explained Professor Mark Sullivan, another co-author from the University of Southampton. “But looking back over a decade, there was no detection of AT2021lwx, then suddenly it appears with the brightness of the brightest things in the universe, which is unprecedented.”  As a next step, the team will collect more data on the explosion and run updated computer simulations to test their theory about what caused it. It is hoped that additional multi-wavelength data will reveal details about the object’s surface and temperature and provide insight into what internal processes are at work. Said co-author Claudia Gutiérrez, a postdoctoral researcher at the ICE-CSIC:  “When you find a transient with properties different from those you are used to monitoring, your first reaction is to try to explain what events can produce them and how. Consequently, multiple alternatives appear, but only very few can describe your observations. This is what happened with this event.”  Artist’s conception of SN2016aps, a candidate pulsational pair-instability supernova that was the most massive supernova ever identified (at the time). Credit: M. Weiss  The team also hopes to take advantage of next-generation facilities that will be coming online in the next few years, like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. Once operational, the observatory will conduct the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), a ten-year campaign covering the entire southern sky and providing the deepest views of the Universe ever observed. Among the many things that the LSST will reveal, astronomers hope that more extremely-rare events like AT2021lwx will be detected. Given how energetic they are, these massive supernovae could be a process that helps shape galaxies over time.

Bhanu died at a hospital in Cuttack Friday.  He was arrested by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of the West Bengal Police Thursday only along with his son, Prithvijit Bag and nephew Biswajit Bag. However, Bhanu, who himself suffered severe burn injuries in that explosion, could not be released from the hospital and brought back to West Bengal.  Confirming the death of Bhanu, the district police superintendent of East Midnapore K. Amarnath claimed that attempts are being made to bring Bhanu’s body back to West Bengal.  Following the death of Bhanu, his son and nephew are the two prime accused now. His nephew, Biswajit has been taken into custody of CID. After the cremation, the police will also take his son, Prithvijit in custody.  State police sources said that Bhanu got admitted to the hospital at Cuttack by misleading the authorities there. He told them that his injury was due to a cylinder blast at a function.  On Thursday, a division bench of the Calcutta High Court directed CID to continue with the probe on the explosion, but after including sections of the Explosives Act in the FIR.  In the initial FIR filed by the police, only sections under the Indian Penal Code and West Bengal Fire Service Act were included for which the state police attracted severe criticism.  Although the initial police investigation has suggested that the explosion was probably from the firecracker manufacturing raw material stocked at the illegal factory, the opposition parties have claimed that the impact of the explosion proves that not firecrackers but crude bombs were being manufactured there.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9yaXNzYXBvc3QuY29tL2JlbmdhbC1maXJlY3JhY2tlci1ibGFzdC1jYXNlLXByaW1lLWFjY3VzZWQtZmFjdG9yeS1vd25lci1kaWVzLWluLW9kaXNoYS1ob3NwaXRhbC_SAW1odHRwczovL3d3dy5vcmlzc2Fwb3N0LmNvbS9iZW5nYWwtZmlyZWNyYWNrZXItYmxhc3QtY2FzZS1wcmltZS1hY2N1c2VkLWZhY3Rvcnktb3duZXItZGllcy1pbi1vZGlzaGEtaG9zcGl0YWwv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"explosion","1989-12-03","Not Discerned","{""Berlin"", ""Berlin"", ""Germany""}","Thu 18 May 2023 00:46:00","Training as a photographer in the early 1980s, Marquardt initially turned his lens on the citizens of East Berlin, with a selection of the resulting portraits featuring in a new exhibition at ArtsDistrict Brooklyn, titled DISTURBING BEAUTY. He recalls shooting the earliest of these black-and-white photos in a cemetery in the borough of Mitte in 1983, explaining: “Cemeteries were quite untouched by ‘dictatorship’ and already seemed [to have] a disturbing beauty to me.”  For more than 18 years, the photographer and bouncer Sven Marquardt has manned the doors of the Berlin superclub Berghain – the perfect vantage point to watch the evolution of the city’s legendary underground scene. “For me and my generation, it still serves as an interface to youth culture,” he tells Dazed, but his connection to the city goes much further back, to the years preceding the fall of the Berlin Wall.  Following the fall of the Berlin Wall, however, Marquardt laid his camera down for several years, caught up in the wild explosion of unified Berlin’s club scene. For several years, he worked as a doorman at the pivotal venue Ostgut, before its closure in 2003. With the opening of Berghain in 2004, he became the nightlife icon (and dreaded gatekeeper for Berghain hopefuls) that we recognise today.  “At the outset nobody knew how it would turn out, and how long it would exist,” he says of the club. 18 years later, though – and despite numerous challenges – Berghain is still going strong, not just as a venue, but as a space with a “strong connection” to Marquardt’s creative work, alongside that of countless other artists.  “For me, club culture has always stood for inspiration, for riot, new departures, free spaces, individuals... zeitgeist,” the photographer adds. As for his notoriously difficult door policy: “It is about protecting the safe space that is Berghain, which also means protecting club culture.” Marquardt notes that the strict entry requirements don’t apply to the subjects in front of his camera, but it’s hard to deny the presence of a sharp curatorial gaze in DISTURBING BEAUTY – a rarefied air that spans subjects young and old from across Berlin’s underground, and beyond.  “Over three decades I have been fortunate enough to see thousands of interesting people,” he concludes. “At the club doors of Berlin, as well as in front of my camera. Looking at people is something marvellous, and an essential part of my life.”  DISTURBING BEAUTY runs at ArtsDistrict Brooklyn from May 18 to May 21, presented by Galerie Deschler. The exhibit is hosted in collaboration with Teksupport, the underground events collective founded by Rob Toma.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYXplZGRpZ2l0YWwuY29tL2FydC1waG90b2dyYXBoeS9hcnRpY2xlLzU5ODg1LzEvYmVybGluLW5pZ2h0bGlmZS1pY29uLXN2ZW4tbWFycXVhcmR0LXN1YnZlcnNpdmUtaGlzdG9yeS1iZXJnaGFpbi1jbHViLWN1bHR1cmXSAZABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGF6ZWRkaWdpdGFsLmNvbS9hcnQtcGhvdG9ncmFwaHkvYXJ0aWNsZS81OTg4NS8xL2Jlcmxpbi1uaWdodGxpZmUtaWNvbi1zdmVuLW1hcnF1YXJkdC1zdWJ2ZXJzaXZlLWhpc3RvcnktYmVyZ2hhaW4tY2x1Yi1jdWx0dXJlP2FtcD0x?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"explosion","1945-04-15","Not Discerned","{""Hiroshima"", ""Hiroshima"", ""Japan""}","Fri 19 May 2023 02:55:00","Our species arose in Africa more than 300,000 years ago, with the oldest-known Homo sapiens fossils discovered at a site in Morocco called Jebel Irhoud, located between Marrakech and the Atlantic coast.  But the scarcity of Homo sapiens fossils from early in our evolutionary history and the geographical spread of those remains in Africa in places like Ethiopia and South Africa have made it difficult to piece together how our species emerged and dispersed across the continent before trekking worldwide. A new study tapping into genome data from modern-day African populations is offering insight into how this may have unfolded.  The research indicated that multiple ancestral groups from across Africa contributed to the emergence of Homo sapiens in a patchwork manner, migrating from one region to another and mixing with one another over hundreds of thousands of years. It also found that everyone alive today can trace their ancestry to at least two distinct populations that were present in Africa dating back about a million years.  The findings did not support a longstanding hypothesis that a single region in Africa gave rise to Homo sapiens or a scenario involving mixture with an unidentified closely related species in the human evolutionary lineage within Africa.  ""All humans share relatively recent common ancestry, but the story in the deeper past is more complicated than our species evolving in just a single location or in isolation,"" said University of Wisconsin-Madison population geneticist Aaron Ragsdale, lead author of the study published this week in the journal Nature.  The ancestral groups were likely spread across a geographic landscape in a population structure that, Ragsdale said, ""was 'weak,' meaning that there was ongoing or at least recurrent migration between groups, and this maintained genetic similarity across ancestral populations.""  Because of the paucity of fossil remains and archaeological evidence, the researchers turned to genome data from living people to find clues about the past. They examined genome data from 290 people, mostly from four geographically and genetically diverse African peoples, to trace the similarities and differences between the populations and identify genetic interconnections over hundreds of thousands of years.  These included: 85 individuals from a West African group called the Mende from Sierra Leone; 44 individuals from the Nama Khoe-San group from southern Africa; 46 individuals from the Amhara and Oromo groups in Ethiopia; and 23 individuals from the Gumuz group, also from Ethiopia. Genome data also was examined from 91 Europeans to account for post-colonial era influence and from a Neanderthal, the extinct human species that was concentrated in Europe until about 40,000 years ago.  The fossil record is scanty in the time period that would be most informative about the emergence and spread of Homo sapiens, and there is no ancient DNA from skeletal or dental remains from these time periods, the researchers said.  ""While we find evidence of anatomically modern human remains and artifacts in different parts of Africa, they are so sparse in space and time that it is difficult to understand their relationships with each other, and with us,"" said study geneticist and study co-author Simon Gravel of McGill University in Montreal. ""Were they related to each other? Are they related to our ancestors, or were they local populations who went extinct?""  ""Genetic data was inherited from a continuous chain of transmissions dating back to well before the origins of modern humans. The relatedness among contemporary humans contains a lot of information about this chain of events,"" Gravel added. ""By building models of how these transmissions occurred, we can test detailed models that relate past populations to present-day populations.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRic25ld3MubmV0L3NjaWVuY2UvZ2Vub21lLWRhdGEtc2hlZHMtbGlnaHQtaG93LWhvbW8tc2FwaWVucy1hcm9zZS1hZnJpY2EtNjM0MzQy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

""I was on the roof checking the water barrels, (when) suddenly I heard the sound of an explosion which caused the water barrel to fall on me. I fell on the neighbour's house and, after that, I didn't feel anything,"" she said.  The 48-year-old is one of 190 people health authorities in the coastal enclave said were wounded in five days of fighting last week between Palestinian militants and Israel, which killed 35 people.  Abu Aisha has no memory of what caused the explosion -- whether it was outgoing or incoming fire -- and her son who was with her remains unable to talk about what happened to his mother.  The family told AFP their home in northern Gaza City is beside a site used by Islamic Jihad militants.  The group fired volleys of rockets from Gaza towards Israel, after top figures within the group were killed in Israeli strikes.  ""I'm half paralysed, I have pain that's not normal and I can't bear any movement of my body,"" said Abu Aisha.  ""I'm tired,"" she said, surrounded by family in a private room within Shifa hospital.  In targeting Islamic Jihad, the Israeli military said it carried out assessments which ""showed that the expected collateral damage to civilians and civilian property will not be excessive in relation to the military advantage anticipated in the attack"".  - 'Destroyed our dreams' -  Doctor Moatasem al-Nono, who was supervising Abu Aisha's case, said the wound to her spinal cord was so severe there is no hope of her regaining movement in her lower limbs.  Her condition has also cut off a vital income for the family in the blockaded Gaza Strip, where unemployment is rife, as she is no longer able to work in the local kindergarten.  Antique collector Hazem Muhanna, 62, said the destruction of his home in an Israeli strike on Gaza City ""destroyed our dreams and our future"".  Story continues  ""If they destroyed my house and five other houses, it would be easier on me than destroying the antiques and artefacts that I cherish,"" said Muhanna, holding up old bank notes and an engraved jug recovered from the ruins.  A retired security guard, Muhanna had for decades used part of his salary to collect antiques and display them in his home ""like a museum"".  His elderly mother sat on a plastic chair in the narrow alley, while his young relatives endeavoured to find more of Muhanna's collectables.  Muhanna said his brother received a call one night from Israeli forces warning him to evacuate the home before they bombed it.  ""I don't know why (the house was targeted). My daughters and sons were here -- 50 people were in the house,"" he said.  Multiple children and civilians were among 33 people killed in Gaza, while one Israeli and a Gazan labourer were killed in Israel.  - 'We're not living' -  Israel's military said it had endeavoured to warn Gazans of their impending bombardment.  ""Buildings were not attacked until they were fully evacuated of civilian population,"" it said in a statement.  Mohammed Sarsour, 29, was weeks away from his wedding and had just finished preparing his apartment for married life when his neighbour told him they were about to be bombed.  ""Then I went home and I couldn't find anything. No window, no bedroom or door,"" he said, in the central Deir al-Balah district.  Broken glass and debris now fill the apartment, while there are deep cracks and gaping holes in the wall.  Sarsour works in a bakery and said he had saved up for years but, with his meagre earnings, he had still taken on debts to renovate the apartment and buy appliances.  ""I'm devastated. I have nothing left to do in my life,"" said Sarsour, whose damaged home looks out onto the rubble of buildings hit by an Israeli strike.  Although a ceasefire has largely held since Saturday, he expected only renewed violence after multiple wars fought across Gaza's borders in recent years.  ""Every two months or a year there's a war,"" he said.

D-backs pitcher Zac Gallen was throwing a side session in the outfield ahead of Arizona’s game against the Oakland Athletics in California on Wednesday and managed to inadvertently hit a passing bird with a throw.  Unfortunately, the bird reportedly did not survive the encounter, which saw it being hit by a Gallen curveball.  The incident was caught on camera, with commentators declaring that “Gallen took some time to recognize that” the bird had died.  This comes some 20 years after another infamous avian casualty by throw episode, which saw then Diamondbacks pitcher Randy Johnson take out a bird in a flurry of feathers back in 2001.  Johnson, who was known for his 100+ mph fastballs, was throwing a pitch in the seventh inning of a spring training game when a bird flew by at just the right moment and was hit by the ball, with an explosion of feathers heralding the bird’s unfortunate demise.  It stands to be seen if this year’s incident is a bad omen – Johnson’s Diamondbacks team then went on to win the World Series in a tight seven-game series against the New York Yankees – but Arizona went on to win on Wednesday 5-3 thanks to a ninth inning rally to send them to 25-19 on the season.

"explosion","2023-05-03","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 15:08:29","Wyden Hearing Statement on IRA Tax Incentives to Create Jobs and Investments in Energy Communities  As Prepared for Delivery  The Finance Committee meets this morning for our first hearing on America’s energy transformation since the Inflation Reduction Act became law.  Two years ago, almost to the day, this committee voted on the Clean Energy for America Act. In writing that legislation, our lodestar was developing a technology-neutral, market-oriented energy policy in which the more you reduce carbon emissions, the bigger your tax savings. The old status quo -- big breaks for big oil, and major uncertainty for clean energy -- was holding our economy back and stifling innovation in America.  Since Democrats passed the IRA, there has been an explosion of new investment announced in clean energy projects all over the country. Wind energy, solar, electric vehicle manufacturing, energy storage.  So far those announcements add up to nearly a quarter trillion dollars of private investment coming off the sidelines. Nearly 150,000 jobs created, many of which will not require a college degree. One new analysis broke the announcements down by state. I’ll share a few examples relevant to this committee:  North Carolina, $5.6 billion.  South Carolina, $11 billion.  Ohio, $7.8 billion -- a big chunk of which is solar manufacturing that Senator Brown fought to ensure the bill would make possible.  Texas, $5 billion.  Tennessee, $5.6 billion.  Michigan, $20 billion.  These projects are taking off all over the country, and they have exceeded expectations. These investments help cut carbon emissions. They help prevent the worst climate disasters. And they help fire up the economic engine for entire communities where the shovels are going into the ground.  A big part of our effort in the IRA was giving a special boost to coal towns and other communities built around extractive industry. The status quo failed them. Plants shuttered, and the people in those communities were too often overlooked and forgotten.  When we wrote the Inflation Reduction Act, people in coal towns had no bigger champion than Senator Casey. He worked to create a special program called “energy communities,” which adds a bonus incentive to drive investment in struggling coal towns and areas with similar histories.  Senator Stabenow ensured that those communities would get an additional boost for advanced manufacturing. Senator Cortez Masto made sure the law would also attract investment to communities with areas known as brownfields, which are often the polluted remnants of old industrial facilities.  This work continues a longstanding effort by Finance Committee Democrats to look out for the interests of coal miners and their families. Senator Brown and Senator Casey fought for years to shore up the miners’ health care and pensions. Senator Warner and Senator Carper were also co-sponsors of the bill that got that done.  So colleagues, the IRA is major progress on clean energy that’s just beginning to take off now that the rules pertaining to energy communities were recently put in place.  The catch is, House Republicans want to repeal nearly all of the energy policies in the Inflation Reduction Act. That’s what the McCarthy plan does.  It would be a major act of economic self-sabotage, because a majority of the investments announced since the IRA became law are going to states represented by Republican Senators.  I’ve heard members say that the IRA policies on energy were totally unnecessary, because these clean energy investments would have happened on their own. The reality is, the level of clean energy investment and job creation would not be anywhere near this high without the Inflation Reduction Act. The old system was holding this investment wave back.  Other members claim the IRA is somehow a threat to America’s energy security. Wrong again. The IRA is all about lowering carbon emissions and creating jobs with clean, made-in-America energy. The U.S. will be less reliant on oil and gas, and that means that Americans will be less vulnerable if Vladimir Putin or other adversaries of the United States decide they want to create chaos and hike up prices.  Two years ago, members of this committee showed real guts to pass the bill that kicked off this energy transformation. They cast tough votes. They took on special interests.  And now the Inflation Reduction Act is proving that you can cut carbon emissions and create jobs and opportunity for Americans all at the same time.  I want to thank our witnesses for joining the committee.  ###","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5maW5hbmNlLnNlbmF0ZS5nb3YvY2hhaXJtYW5zLW5ld3Mvd3lkZW4taGVhcmluZy1zdGF0ZW1lbnQtb24taXJhLXRheC1pbmNlbnRpdmVzLXRvLWNyZWF0ZS1qb2JzLWFuZC1pbnZlc3RtZW50cy1pbi1lbmVyZ3ktY29tbXVuaXRpZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

After the Mud Hens struck for a run in the top of the first, Omaha quickly rallied in the bottom half as the first five batters reached, with four runs immediately scoring on two-run homers from Samad Taylor and Logan Porter. Clay Dungan singled home one and Major League rehabber Drew Waters followed with a two-run double, his second hit of the inning and what went on to be four in the game.  Toledo snuck back, scoring runs in the next three innings to eventually knock starter Daniel Lynch out of the game. While Lynch was charged with five runs on nine hits over 3.2 innings, he struck out a season-high eight and did not walk a batter in his third rehab start with Omaha.  Behind Lynch, left-hander Walter Pennington allowed a leadoff single, then retired his next seven batters for 2.1 scoreless innings.  With Pennington keeping the Mud Hens at bay, Omaha's offense got back to work and scored runs in each of its final five innings of at-bats. After Taylor scored in the fourth, Angelo Castellano connected on a two-run homer in the fifth.  In the sixth, Taylor doubled for his second two-bagger and third extra-base hit of the game, came around to score on a Porter single, then Porter scored on Jakson Reetz' second double of the game.  Tyler Gentry singled across two in the seventh, giving all nine Storm Chasers batters at least one hit, then back-to-back doubles from Dungan and Castellano in the eight added two more runs to the scoreboard.  On top of hits from every hitter in the order, eight players scored runs and seven drove in runs, including six multi-hit games, six multi-score games and six multi-RBI games. While 16 runs and 18 hits set season-highs for the club, so did 10 extra-base hits (7 doubles and 3 homers) and 34 total bases.  After Jonah Dipoto pitched a scoreless seventh, the Mud Hens did not go quietly, as Dipoto surrendered a two-run homer in the eight, the second two-run shot of the game from Toledo's Jermaine Palacios. Brooks Kriske got two quick outs in the ninth but two walks and a double scored another run, bringing the game to the 16-8 score that held to be final.  Omaha will try and jump ahead in the series on Thursday as left-hander Austin Cox takes the mound for a 6:35 p.m. CT first pitch.  • Discuss this story on the International League message board...

In her fourth year on council, DeAngelis is a registered nurse, having worked for Trinity Health System for many years, and currently prepares Hancock County students for work in the field as an instructor and Skills USA advisor. She also is a member of St. Anthony Catholic Church.  She said if re-elected, she will work with others “to make sure our community is a safe, healthy place citizens can be proud of. Council is looking at updating present city ordinances and establishing new ones that will be enforced to help better the city.”  DeAngelis said she has supported the acquisition of grants for projects currently in development, including improvements to the city’s water and wastewater treatment systems and renovations to its firehouse and will support the continued search for grants for recreational facilities, such as pickle ball and basketball courts and lighting and restrooms for parks.  She said to prevent young adults from moving from the city, “Economic development is needed and we need to make sure we have the infrastructure to support it.”  “I am here to help with any issues the residents of the 5th Ward have. I am a problem-solver and communicate well with others, which enables me to better serve as a councilwoman.”  Kafton has worked in private industry for 12 years, serving currently as a process safety manager in the oil and gas industry and holds a bachelor’s degree from Eastern Kentucky University in fire and safety engineering.

"explosion","2018-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Toronto"", ""Ontario"", ""Canada""}","Thu 18 May 2023 13:00:00","Open this photo in gallery: Author Kyo Maclear.David Wall/Handout  What happens when you discover that the story of who you are and where you come from is completely different from the one you were told your entire life? That’s the explosive premise at the heart of Unearthing, the new memoir by Toronto writer Kyo Maclear – who, three months after the 2018 death of her father, celebrated foreign correspondent Michael Maclear, received the results of a DNA test showing he wasn’t her biological parent.  Maclear, the author of multiple children’s books, two novels and the Trillium Book Award-winning memoir Birds Art Life, found herself excavating not only her own history, but also that of her mother Yoko (Mariko) Koide – and the roots of their complicated relationship.  The result is a deeply thoughtful meditation on secrets and stories, race and lineage, grief and grace – all told through the narrative of the common language Maclear and her mother, aging and losing her memory, landed on: tending to a shared garden.  As Maclear presses her reluctant mother for answers to the questions that have blown her life wide open, she comes to realize that amid the muddled memories and half-truths also lie lessons in what it takes for new things to grow – patience, pragmatism and a willingness to accept beauty (whether in flowers and plants or the ineffable bonds of family) in all its wild, unruly forms.  How did you land on the non-linear, poetic way of framing what is a very complex narrative?  I decided to structure the book through the passage of seasons and in increments, partly because the way the information was arriving was in these tiny little parcels. We often think of seasons as large, changing blocks of time, but I was more interested in looking at gradients, and how the landscape and scenery was changing in this minuscule way.  In some ways, I created a parallel between the story of my mother and the story of the ambient natural world that I didn’t always pay much attention to but was always the backdrop to everything that was going on in my life. Once you start to think about plants and gardens, you realize that all these things that you underestimated as passive are actually very active agents in the world.  The structure also felt a bit like a garden itself, in the sense that there’s a messiness to it – there’s an attempt to reshape things, but then they fall apart again – it’s just a constant process.  In trying to unravel the mystery of your own family background, what did the idea of kinship come to mean to you?  A close writer friend of mine recently called Unearthing the ultimate “bait-and-switch” – a DNA surprise story that becomes a book about kinship beyond biology and ancestry beyond heredity.  What I hope to convey is that it’s okay to have your coastlines expanded and dissolved. It’s okay to have an identity crisis and grow and change shape – as individuals, families, countries. The conservative, fence-driven logic we are seeing around the world shows what happens when identity hardens and constricts. Xenophobia, anti-migration, fascism – these are all kin-driven patterns. I hope readers are reminded that permeability is a strength, not a weakness.  Many of the people I’ve known in my lifetime have been those who’ve shown me that there are infinite ways of making family. I had to realize actually that’s where my heart is – I don’t really need to redefine myself in relation to a new family.  How did you approach telling a thorny story that wasn’t just your own, but involved many others close to you?  I was very careful in honouring the complexity of people – I didn’t want anything to feel like I was settling scores. I wanted to uplift everyone’s humanity and try to understand why the secret was kept the way it was kept. And one thing I really tried to do was create a context for the story, which is to show that it came out of a social environment, responding to the conventions of the time.  I revealed a set of facts some people once wanted hidden. I tried to do this with a sense of sensitivity rather than swagger. I left a lot out and tried to respect what was not mine to tell. But I also pushed back when I felt energies were being directed at concealment for no good reason – often out of old habits of secrecy and feelings of shame. I wanted to dislodge all of that not just for the sake of piecing together my own story, but to clear the clogged passageways of my family.  What did trying to understand your mother’s history – especially how she was seen and treated under the white, patriarchal gaze as an Asian immigrant woman – tell you about your own experience as someone from a mixed-race background?  I think that as people who are sensitive to language, we have to be a bit more brave about the way we say things. For example, when people talk about interracial marriages, they’ll say things like “cultures bumping up against each other,” as if they were bumper cars or something. When really, I see that in my house there were these racial and gender lines that my mother was dealing with, especially in the time that she moved to Canada in the seventies.  I was thinking about Everything Everywhere All at Once, and I realized that my mother was always kind of wanting an altered version of me, like in the way [the film’s protagonist] Evelyn and her daughter are always misreading each other. We all have these different sliding-door scenarios – and I think that’s compounded when you have a child and you’ve lost some of your previous life’s worlds.  What do you think your mother would take away from the book?  I think she would get a kick out of the way she wins – because I kind of surrender. There is this expectation in memoir that you go through a difficult experience and then you have this epiphany, right? But I didn’t have it – it wasn’t possible to have that for lots of reasons. But in the end, there’s no reckoning and I surrender – that may sound negative, but it was a kind of release; a letting-go.

"explosion","2023-01-01","Not Discerned","{""DesMoines"", ""Iowa"", ""UnitedStates""}","Fri 19 May 2023 01:56:02","DES MOINES – Columbus Catholic junior Mason Knipp may be a greenhorn to the world of track and field, but he’s now a fifth place State-finisher in shot put with a 52-01 personal best.  Knipp’s effort highlighted a strong afternoon session for Class 2A and 3A competitors at the opening day of the state track and field championships at Drake Stadium.  Outside track, Knipp is a four-sport athlete, doing football, rugby and is a state champion wrestler. But according to Knipp, they all have one thing in common.  “All these sports are kind of similar. You have to be explosive and powerful,” Knipp said. “And so it just kind of went along with what I already do and so it just fit into what I am.”  His toss in the blue oval is a personal best, improving on his previous record by three feet. Knipp came into the sport through Head Coach Nick Bellamy, who was his weight-lifting instructor. Impressed by his strength, Bellamy invited him to toss the shot. For Knipp, it was love at first throw. Having set a new PR and finished in the top five on his first try, Knipp is thrilled.  “I feel great today,” Knipp said.  “Some of this is kind of new to me, but it’s cool to be down here,” he added.  Happy with the results, Knipp said he’d be back next year. In the meantime, he’ll have time to practice being explosive in the other sports he loves.  Sauser runs strong: It was also a first for Oelwein sophomore Conall Sauser to run the 3,200-meter race without his older brother Brennan, who graduated last year. It took some adjusting for Sauser, who lost not only his kin, but his rival.  “It was just a lot more fun with my brother,” Sauser said. “He was in most of the races that I was, so we could always push each other. So this year, I kind of had to learn how to push myself without him, which is hard.”  But Sauser found motivation in the other runners around him who admires. Kaden Lynch from Grundy Center was one.  “I started going with really good guys,” he said. “I go with people like that and they get me through it.”  The new motivation seemed to do the trick, putting him in fifth place with a time of 9:59.90 – and improvement of nearly 44 seconds over last year, when he finished 22nd.  Emerson Vokes from Grundy Center finished seventh in the 3,200-meter run with a time of 10:01.2.  Lynch took ninth in 10:01.20 and Denver’s Neal Pinter was 11th in 10:09.30.  Strong run: In preliminaries, Aplington-Parkersburg came in strong for shuttle hurdles, finishing third to qualify for Saturday’s finals with a time of 1:01.4.  “We’re looking forward to it, we ran a PR here, so we’re looking for a PR again, that’s our goal,” said Aidan Junker. “So we just want our best time, we’ve got some people to chase, so that’ll be good for us.”  Junker teammed with Kael Stotler, Nick Neuroth and Kaden Huttinger.  Top finishers (2A)  Aidan Junker, Kael Stotler, Nick Neuroth and Kaden Huttinger from Aplington-Parkersburg finished third in the shuttle hurdle preliminaries with a time of 1:01.4.  Evan Dorn, Isaac Larson, Chase Baumgartner and Kasey Wirtjes from Denver finished seventh in the shuttle hurdle preliminaries with a times of 1:02.16.  Colin Gordon, Cooper Hoy, Jacob Hoy and Tiernan Vokes from Grundy Center finished eighth in the shuttle hurdle preliminaries with a time of 1:02.75.  Jack Miller from Jesup finished fourth in the long jump with a distance of 22-01.75.  Top finishers (3A)  Sam Roose, Jameson Toma, Marquis Olson and Asa Newsom from Waverly-Shell Rock finished eight in the shuttle hurdle preliminaries with a time of 1:01.68.

"explosion","1974-05-18","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 11:51:38","Announcing to the world that India had entered an elite group of nations whose members possessed nuclear capabilities, India conducted its first nuclear tests on May 18, 1974, in Pokhran, Rajasthan, as part of the ‘Smiling Buddha’ operation.  Then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi termed the event a “peaceful nuclear explosion”, perhaps to assuage the rest of the world and particularly the members of the United Nations Security Council’s permanent five (or P-5) members: the United States, the United Kingdom, France, China and Russia.  Under what circumstances did India choose to conduct nuclear tests?  The end of World War II in 1945 did not mean an end to the possibility of a large-scale war breaking out. The US and the USSR continued engaging in proxy wars in other countries, for ideological and economic superiority, in what was dubbed the Cold War.  With the US dropping two nuclear bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki towards the end of the war in August 1945, and the Soviet Union carrying out its own nuclear test in 1949, it was decided that certain regulations were required to prevent massive devastation.  To maintain a kind of minimal peace, one such treaty was signed in 1968, called the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). Nuclear-weapon States parties under the NPT are defined as those that manufactured and exploded a nuclear weapon or other nuclear explosive devices before January 1, 1967, effectively meaning the P-5 countries.  Firstly, its signatories agreed not to transfer either nuclear weapons or nuclear weapons technology to any other state. Second, the non-nuclear states agreed that they would not receive, develop or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons.  All of the signatories agreed to submit to the safeguards against proliferation established by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Parties to the treaty also agreed to help end the nuclear arms race and limit the spread of the technology.  Advertisement  However, India objected to this treaty on the grounds that it was discriminatory to countries except the P-5. As per foreign policy researcher Sumit Ganguly, “The government of India refused to accede to the terms of the treaty because it failed to address India’s misgivings”, specifically, the fact that non-nuclear states’ pledge to not develop such weapons was not linked to any such definite obligation on part of the states already possessing nuclear weapons.  Opinion | Why India went nuclear 25 years ago  Domestically, Indian scientists Homi J Bhabha and Vikram Sarabhai had laid the groundwork earlier for nuclear energy to be tested in India. In 1954, the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) was founded, with Bhabha as director.  An early proponent of nuclear energy, Bhabha once wrote, “Moreover, when nuclear energy has been successfully applied for power production in say a couple of decades from now, India will not have to look abroad for its experts but will find them ready at hand.” But then Prime Minister Jawahar Lal Nehru continued being skeptical of nuclear weapons and expanding arms’ acquisition in general.  Advertisement  A change of leadership in the 1960s (with the death of PM Nehru and his successor Morarji Desai), a war with China in 1962 that India lost, and wars with Pakistan in 1965 and 1971, both won by India, changed the direction of India’s plans. China also conducted its tests in 1964.  How did Pokhran-I happen?  Unlike Nehru, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi did not hold a negative view of nuclear tests. But given the treaties that the P-5 had in place, India decided to conduct its tests without any prior information being released to the world.  There was uncertainty even till the end, according to an account detailed by political commentator Inder Malhotra. “Raja Ramanna, the mastermind of the venture [Atomic Energy Commission Chairman], two of Indira Gandhi’s top advisers, PN Haksar and PN Dhar, were opposed to it, and wanted it postponed. Homi Sethna, chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, offered no opinion. D Nag Chaudhuri, Scientific Adviser to the Defence Minister, started weighing pros and cons but was cut short by the prime minister. ‘Dr. Ramanna,’ she said, turning to him, ‘please go ahead. It would be good for the country’. The next morning, the Buddha smiled,” he wrote.  A nuclear device was detonated, with a yield of 12-13 kiloton of TNT, on May 18, 1974. Pokhran, an army test range located in the desert of western Rajasthan, was chosen. A team of around 75 researchers and scientists were involved. Its code name came from the test’s date being on the same day as Buddha Jayanti, the birth date of Gautam Buddha.  And what happened after the tests?  India demonstrated to the world that it could defend itself in an extreme situation and chose not to immediately weaponise the nuclear device it tested at Pokhran. This was to happen only after 1998’s Pokhran-II tests.  Advertisement  But before that, it would face significant criticism from many countries.  In 1978, US President Jimmy Carter signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act, following which the US ceased exporting nuclear assistance to India. The US view on India testing such technologies would only shift on July 18, 2005, when US President George W Bush and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh first announced their intention to enter into a nuclear agreement in Washington.  Advertisement  The US also pushed for setting up a club of nuclear equipment and fissile material suppliers. The 48-nation Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) would go on to implement agreed rules for exporting nuclear equipment, with a view to controlling the spread of nuclear weapons and where members would be admitted only by consensus.  India has been trying, since 2008, to join the group, which would give it a place at the high table where the rules of nuclear commerce are decided — and, eventually, the ability to sell equipment. Many countries that initially opposed its entry, like Australia, have changed stance; Mexico and Switzerland are the latest to voice support. India’s effort has been to chip away at the resistance, leaving only one holdout — China.  Advertisement  This was one reason as to why India did not immediately go for the next step, that of the testing a nuclear bomb, doing so only in 1998. Then too, the international reaction was criticical, but over the years India has projected itself as a “responsible” owner of these weapons, allowing acceptance among countries and into groups like the NSG.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvZXhwbGFpbmVkL2V4cGxhaW5lZC1oaXN0b3J5L29wZXJhdGlvbi1zbWlsaW5nLWJ1ZGRoYS1udWNsZWFyLWZpcnN0LXRlc3QtcG9raHJhbi1oaXN0b3J5LTg2MTY3MTQv0gGHAWh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9leHBsYWluZWQvZXhwbGFpbmVkLWhpc3Rvcnkvb3BlcmF0aW9uLXNtaWxpbmctYnVkZGhhLW51Y2xlYXItZmlyc3QtdGVzdC1wb2tocmFuLWhpc3RvcnktODYxNjcxNC9saXRlLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

""One of the ways they were able to do that is with empty sets, with spread offense concepts. Here's a way the New Orleans Saints could add that in.""

The alerts extended to all regions of the country for about an hour from 2 a.m. (2300 GMT).  But there were no reports of strikes on infrastructure or civilian targets and no indications of casualties as the alerts were withdrawn in Kyiv and in central and southern regions.  Air raid alerts remained in force into the early morning throughout western Ukraine, but only in two regions in the east and Russian-annexed Crimea in the south.

"explosion","2019-04-03","Not Discerned","{""SanFrancisco"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","Fri 19 May 2023 02:18:16","San Francisco officials are opening a new investigation aimed at Twitter’s Mid-Market headquarters after an explosive lawsuit from former senior employees alleged numerous instances where members of owner Elon Musk’s team knowingly broke local and federal laws.  The six former employees say Twitter didn’t pay promised severance and that Musk’s team instructed staff to disable lights and install locks that wouldn’t open during an emergency at employee bedrooms at 1355 Market St., violating building codes.  “Twitter’s new leadership deliberately, specifically, and repeatedly announced their intentions to breach contracts, violate laws, and otherwise ignore their legal obligations,” the six former employees alleged in a lawsuit filed Tuesday in Delaware federal court.  The suit names Twitter’s successor company X Corp. and Musk as defendants. Twitter, which laid off its communications team, auto-replied to an emailed request for comment with a poop emoji.  “We will be opening a new complaint and conducting an investigation into these new allegations,” Patrick Hannan, a spokesperson for the city’s Department of Building Inspection, told The Chronicle.  Plaintiff Joseph Killian, the former Twitter lead project manager of global design and construction, described Musk’s team allegedly telling him to violate building codes as part of creating rooms for tired employees to sleep in.  In addition to installing beds, Killian said he was told to disconnect motion-sensitive lights because they were bothering people trying to sleep, despite Twitter’s landlord rejecting that request. He said he hired an electrician to do so, allegedly violating both the building code and Twitter’s lease.  Killian also said he was told to install space heaters, violating the lease, and install door locks that “were not compliant with life safety and egress codes” because they wouldn’t automatically unlock in case of fire or earthquake.  Killian said that doing so would block “first responders from being able to access the rooms” in case of emergency, but that Musk’s team wanted cheaper locks that wouldn’t automatically unlock.  “Nobody cared,” the lawsuit stated. “Killian quit that day.” The lawsuit alleges that non-compliant locks were later installed by someone else.  Killian said that he was told not to detail these planned changes when city inspectors visited the building in December.  “When the city inspectors came to inspect the hotel rooms, they expressed surprise and relief to Killian, saying, ‘This is just furniture! We expected more drastic changes,’ ” according to the lawsuit.  The city previously ruled Twitter needed to update a building permit to come into compliance and allow for areas for workers to sleep in. But six months after the bedroom investigation started, the permit has not been approved.  The other five plaintiffs include Wolfram Arnold, a former staff software engineer; Erik Froese, former software engineering senior manager; Tracy Hawkins, who led Twitter’s real estate division; Laura Chan Pytlarz, former global strategy lead of food and events; and Andrew Schlaikjer, former senior staff machine learning engineer. They couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.  Hawkins said she quit after Twitter stopped paying vendors or its office landlords, an alleged move that has also sparked numerous lawsuits, including from Shorenstein, Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters landlord. Twitter had over $130 million in annual office rent obligations, according to the lawsuit.  “Elon told me he would only pay rent over his dead body,” Musk adviser Pablo Mendoza allegedly told Hawkins, according to the lawsuit.  The lawsuit alleges that Musk’s attorney Alex Spiro “loudly opined that it was unreasonable for Twitter’s landlords to expect Twitter to pay rent, since San Francisco was a s— hole.”  Arnold, Froese, Pytlarz and Schlaikjer allege that they were fired and not paid “contractually required severance.”  The plaintiffs are seeking severance, punitive damages for “flagrant bad faith,” alleged fraud and alleged violation of local and federal laws.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS9iYXlhcmVhL2FydGljbGUvcy1mLW9wZW5pbmctbmV3LXR3aXR0ZXItaW52ZXN0aWdhdGlvbi1leC13b3JrZXJzLTE4MTA3NjMzLnBocNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Sexual extortion, or ""sextortion,"" is a form of blackmail where victims are lured into sending explicit images online and then threatened to do something they don't want to do, like send more photos or money.  ""I tell people all the time, Gavin was not depressed,"" Guffey told ABC News. ""He was, in my opinion, living his best life before he took his own.""  Now, the Republican state lawmaker from Rock Hill, South Carolina, is pushing through a piece of legislation (H 3583) that would criminalize sextortion in the state. It passed the state house and senate and will head to the governor's desk soon.  Under the proposed law, perpetrators who extort minors or at-risk adults could face up to 20 years in prison. According to Guffey, elevating these crimes to felonies will also give law enforcement the ability to cross state lines to chase down alleged perpetrators.  An increase in reported cases  Thorn, an organization dedicated to ending the sexual exploitation of children, started tracking this type of online grooming pre-pandemic and said it saw a ""dramatic increase in reports"" during the pandemic and in recent months.  Between 2019 and 2021, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children said the number of reports made to its organization involving the sextortion of children or teens more than doubled.  ""I don't know that we necessarily armed our children with the tools that they needed to be safe in the face of this type of extortion or built our platforms in a way that would create a safe environment,"" Thorn's CEO Julie Cordua told ABC News.  In early 2023, the FBI issued a national public safety alert regarding an ""explosion in incidents of children and teens being coerced."" According to the FBI, law enforcement agencies saw 3,000 minor victims targeted in 2022, with the majority of them being boys.  In most reported cases, experts said the first contact is made through social media where young male victims are led to believe they are exchanging messages with a girl their own age.  Guffey told ABC News that Gavin received an Instagram message on July 27, 2022, from an account posing as a teenage girl, just around midnight. About an hour and a half after that first contact, Gavin took his own life.  Gavin Guffey, 17, from Rock Hill, S.C., seen here in an undated file photo was a one-of-a-kind guy his dad told ABC News. Courtesy Guffey family  ""I refused to believe it at first. There's no way that he could have been under that much stress that quickly that it would have caused this decision,"" Guffey said  In the weeks following Gavin's funeral, Guffey said various family members received dozens of threatening Instagram messages demanding money to keep the explicit images private. That's when Guffey connected the dots and uncovered what had pushed his son to suicide.  ""Did I tell you your son begged for his life,"" read one of the Instagram messages, according to Guffey.  Gavin's case is still under investigation by local law enforcement, the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, the FBI, and Homeland Security.  ""We support legislation that empowers law enforcement to pursue those who commit the heinous act of sextortion and applaud Representative Guffey’s efforts on this bill. No family should ever have to experience a tragedy like this,"" a Meta spokesperson told ABC News. ""We want teens to have a safe experience on our apps, and we’ve built technology and tools to help protect our users from criminals and scammers of this kind.""  ""We encourage teens and adults to report suspicious or harmful content, activity or accounts in our apps if they feel unsafe, and we take action and will reach out to law enforcement in cases of imminent harm. Teens can also use NCMEC’s Take It Down, a new tool we supported that helps prevent young people’s intimate images from being posted online in the future,"" Meta's statement continued.  Experts said the number of young victims impacted is likely much larger than reported because many do not come forward.  ""I believe we've got to start wearing our shame as adults if we want our kids to understand that it's okay,"" to ask for help, said Guffey, who decided with his wife to share Gavin's story in order to raise public awareness.  And that's exactly what happened when Christina and Jason Scheffer, from Huson, Montana, heard about Gavin's case.  Waylon Scheffer is shown in this undated photo is described by his family as a true Montana boy who loved fishing and hunting. Kelsey Farago Photography  Their son, Waylon Scheffer, was just 16 years old when they say scammers drove him to take his own life on Dec. 14, 2022. The Scheffers said talking with Guffey helped them understand the intricacies of how scammers used social media to prey on their own teenage son.  ""I got your nude,"" reads one of the threatening messages sent to Waylon and reviewed by ABC News. ""I will start sending your nude and put it on the newspaper, and make sure I make life miserable for you.""  Waylon's case is still under investigation by local law enforcement.  Waylon and Gavin are among the more than a dozen American teenage boys who have lost their lives after being threatened and extorted online this past year, said the FBI.  ""The best advice that I give that I think to give parents is to not allow your children to have any of their devices in private rooms such as bathrooms and bedrooms,"" Guffey said.  Out of the darkness  ""The greatest harm will be if the perpetrator wins because the child is ashamed and afraid,"" Cordua said. She told ABC News that creating a blame-free space will help your child feel safe enough to come forward if something goes wrong.  ""Talk about this stuff,"" agreed Jason Scheffer, who had spoken to his son on multiple occasions about these types of scams.  And since Waylon's passing, Scheffer said his school will introduce a phone safety training class for both parents and students.  As part of Guffey's bill, school districts will also be required to educate students about sextortion on an annual basis.  ""This is the best part of the bill, in my opinion, because the hardest thing to do is to raise awareness to get parents and students talking about this,"" said Guffey.  What about the platforms  Experts said disappearing messages on WhatsApp, Instagram and Snapchat create a false sense of security. Because of these features, a teen may feel more comfortable sharing an explicit image, but experts said scammers often record the conversation.  Snapchat and Instagram notify users if another user takes screenshots or screen-recording their chat, but this doesn't stop perpetrators from finding workarounds.  ""Any form of sexual exploitation is abhorrent and illegal and we have dedicated teams that work closely with authorities, experts, and industry partners to combat it,"" a Snapchat spokesperson told ABC News.

For example, if an account is flagged by multiple users, especially young users, that should raise a flag on the platform side.  ""There's a pattern in this data, and so platforms have the ability to see what is happening and identify where the risk factors are on their platform,"" she added. Cordua said they could consider adding a few more ""road bumps"" that would help pull young people out of conversations with adults.

Ryan Twp. Fire Company Deputy Chief Matt Morgan said the driver, who was able to exit from the vehicle on his own, was evaluated at the scene by EMS personnel and later declined medical treatment.

"explosion","2023-05-18","10:00:00","{""Independence"", ""Missouri"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 14:12:00","Profitable Bootstrapped Business Model Succeeds Amid Volatile VC/PE Funding Market  INDEPENDENCE, Ohio, May 18, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Contract Guardian, Inc. (CG), a leading provider of SaaS healthcare contract lifecycle management software, today announced that its revenues and net earnings have tripled over the past four years. The company credits organic growth to a combination of unwavering focus on solving client contract management challenges with hardened entrepreneurial bootstrapping business lessons learned over 34 years. This contrasts with the typical SaaS-company growth model of venture capital, private equity funding, or merger/acquisition that tends to favor additional growth over all else.  Contract Guardian Logo  The contract management software market is growing rapidly with revenues expected to reach nearly $3.6 billion by the end of 2028 on a compound annual growth rate of 12%, according to Verified Market Research. Growth is driven by a changing regulatory landscape, increasing contract complexity, and the drive by healthcare organizations to reduce costs.  ""Large healthcare organizations may have more than 30,000 contracts to manage,"" Matt Paterini, PharmD and VP Contract Guardian said, ""and many diverse types, including agreements with vendors, payers, employees, leasing firms, affiliates, and contract physicians just to name a few. Different departments tend to operate in silos making contract management an even greater challenge.""  Contract Guardian's successes are attributed to the software's ease of use, responsive interface, custom workflows, and automatic notifications, among other features. For example, notifications alone can help organizations realize significant savings by alerting administrators to events such as automatic renewals, which can bind organizations to a contract long after goods or services are required. Contract Guardian is also distinctive in its laser focus on healthcare and the tailored configuration that goes into each customer's implementation.  Story continues  More recently, the firm has benefited from the increased involvement of CEO Jim Kandrac in Contract Guardian's growth strategy. Kandrac started and scaled UCG Technologies over 34 years into a technology services firm spanning thirty-one states, Canada, and the Caribbean. Since the December 2021 sale of UCG Technologies, Kandrac has focused his energies on growing Contract Guardian which he purchased in 2018. Contract Guardian's Vice President Matt Paterini, whose healthcare background includes a Doctor of Pharmacy degree and extensive health system administration experience is invaluable in leading the day-to-day operations.  Kandrac explains, ""Contract Guardian is uniquely positioned in the CLM marketplace to address hospital business issues and pains. The solution was initially developed for a multinational health system 16 years ago and has been continuously enhanced since. The combination of longevity coupled with our team's healthcare expertise makes for a winning combination for hospital clients.""  The company has also benefited from consolidation in its own market, with one of its leading competitors having recently been acquired by a provider of healthcare governance, risk, and compliance software. The result within those acquired has been ""increased pricing, increased system downtime, and lack of support,"" Paterini said. Contract Guardian inquiries have increased by over 30% in the past nine months.  With CG renewal rates of better than 96% and customers who range from small rural institutions to multinational giants, Contract Guardian's SaaS solution and ""Train the Trainer"" onboarding approach has proven itself in a wide range of use healthcare scenarios.  ""We're distinctive in being solely focused on healthcare,"" Paterini said. ""You don't need an IT degree to use our software and each onboarding comes with expertise from client consultants who know hospitals and have collaborated with them for many years.""  The privately-owned company has hospital clients in forty-four states, is profitable, and is in business to solve client problems, issues, and pains having ingrained successful business principles from the history of UCG Technologies. ""CG isn't a software company chasing revenue and customers at the expense of our existing clients,"" Paterini said. ""I suppose you could say CG's not an exciting Silicon Valley startup, but with a tripling of business and no requirement for debt or PE/VC dollars, it's a great place to be.""

"explosion","2023-04-01","Not Discerned","{""Cupertino"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 14:23:16","Despite taking different forms and serving different purposes, all Apple devices feel like they’re from the same company. Apparently, for the long-rumored Apple VR/AR headset, consistency might not be the case.  A lengthy report from Bloomberg (opens in new tab) discusses the monumental moment that could be coming at WWDC 2023, where Apple is expected to reveal its Reality Pro headset and xrOS interface in front of developers. According to the report, the headset is not only far from the original vision, but is ‘un-Apple-like’ in more ways than one.  In fact, consultant and former Apple exec Michael Gartenberg says the Apple headset could be “one of the great tech flops of all time.""  Perhaps the most uncharacteristic thing is the Apple VR/AR headset price. Apple devices aren’t strangers to premium price tags, but with multiple tips pointing to a $3,000 cost, this headset will make the best VR headsets look cheap. What’s more, the company is “reported to be planning to sell Reality Pro at a breakeven cost.” For comparison, Apple usually makes a 37% margin on its products.  Similarly, Apple has lowered headset sales hopes from 3 million units to 900,000 units. On average, the company sells past 200 million iPhones per year, so the headset is not expected to become as ubiquitous as other Apple products. At least, not at first. If the company adds new features and lowers the price down for next-gen versions, internal projections suggest the headset will reach Apple Watch-level adoption.  A world-facing display (and external battery)  Apple is hoping an external display will warm people up to the product by keeping “wearers engaged with the real world.” The headset will reportedly feature a world-facing display that demonstrates eye movements and facial expressions. One of Bloomberg’s sources said this display will let others “interact with a headset wearer without feeling as if they’re talking to a robot.” It’s hard to say without seeing it in action, but it sounds a bit creepy based on the description.  Another reason for the external display is to promote all-day wear. According to the report, the headset may be able to replace tasks otherwise done on iPhones and Macs. Think: gaming, web searching, FaceTiming and even exercising. Apparently, the company also hopes third-party apps will help with the headset’s popularity.  The final “un-Apple-like” element of the headset as it is currently rumored is the external battery. It's difficult to name a modern Apple product that lacks intuition, so the expectation that wearers will have to awkwardly tote around an external battery tethered to the headset sounds very off-brand. Even if the headset comes bundled with a chic battery carrying pack, the setup seems like it would still lack grace.  Will Apple Reality Pro be a letdown?  Based on this Bloomberg report, the VR headset we'll see at WWDC has strayed far from the company's original vision and will need more time to marinate in the market than other Apple devices. Apples foray into mixed reality could certainly make the category as a whole more mainstream, but it seems like some sacrifices have been made along the way.  That said, there are ways the Apple headset can prove skeptics wrong. Beyond reports of 'far exceeding' the capabilities of competing headsets, a controller-less experience, brilliant AR pass-through and the power of Apple silicon could all help to generate excitement for the Reality Pro.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNndWlkZS5jb20vbmV3cy9hcHBsZS1yZWFsaXR5LXByby1oZWFkc2V0LXNvdW5kcy1saWtlLXRoZS1tb3N0LXVuLWFwcGxlLWxpa2UtZGV2aWNlLWluLW5ldy1yZXBvcnTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Video / NZ Herald  Rocket Lab chief executive Peter Beck has concerns for his main competitor Elon Musk’s regard for safety, but other than that, says Musk’s “just a guy”.  Speaking to Markets with Madison from California, where his Kiwi-founded rocket launching company is now based, Beck said the new rocket his company was building, named Neutron, would go “head to head” with Musk’s SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.  Neutron is a direct competitor to a SpaceX’s Falcon 9.  “So, that’s certainly a little bit more of a heads to heads approach,” Beck said.  SpaceX was currently testing its super-heavy Starship rocket - it exploded in its first test flight in April.  Beck found one thing “terribly surprising” about that test.  “The flight termination system took 40 seconds to activate, which is is very concerning generally.  “When you terminate a rocket, it should be instantaneous, not nearly a minute later. So, I think that they’re gonna have to do some work to solve that problem.”  Beck proudly stated that Rocket Lab was the only rocket provider to have successfully launched and place satellites into orbit this year - it was seeing more customers such as Nasa to come to it with missions as a result.  “We’ve established ourselves as the the most reliable small launch vehicle, with the second most frequently launched rocket behind SpaceX.”  Watch Beck’s interview in today’s episode of Markets with Madison above.

House on fire in Frederick following tanker truck explosion (Photo from Frederick County Fire & Rescue Services)  Frederick, Md (KM) The Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration will install guardrails along a three-mile stretch of US Route 15 in Frederick. The work is expected to take place this coming Sunday through Thursday, May 21st to May 25th. The hours will be from 10:00 PM to 5:00 AM.  Andrew Ratcliffe, the District 7 Engineer for Frederick, Carroll and Howard Counties, says this project follows the fatal tanker truck crash, explosion and fire in March along Route 15 near Apple Avenue in Frederick. He notes that guardrails were installed near the crash site shortly after that incident. “Immediately after the tanker crash, we looked to address that area along Apple Avenue. So we installed guardrail from the spot where the Rosemont Avenue entrance ramp ties into US 15 northbound,” he says. “And then ran along Apple Avenue and connected to the existing guardrail that was there that kind of ran up to the bridge over West 7th Street.”  The tanker explosion and fire burned the vegetation along Route 15 near Apple Avenue, and did extensive damage to a nearby house. The tanker truck driver was the only fatality from the accident. No one else was injured. The tanker was carrying gasoline.  MDOT SHA says crews will close the shoulder and right lane of northbound US Route 15 at Jefferson Street. The Guardrail will be installed along northbound US 15 between Jefferson Street and the exit ramp to eastbound US 40; northbound US 15 between 7th Street and Motter Avenue; the ramp from Motter Avenue onto southbound US 15; the ramp from eastbound US 40 to southbound US 15; and southbound US 15 between the Opposumtown Pike ramp and the 7th Street exit ramp.  The work is expected to be completed by the end of next week, weather permitting, says MDOT SHA.  Ratcliffe says guardrails protect an errant vehicle from leaving the road and possibly getting into a bad crash. But he says there are other considerations MDOT SHA must think about before erecting guardrails. :”While it protects the roadside, the guardrails can make what could be a simple single vehicle crash and could make it more serious as the guardrail is a hazard,” says Ratcliffe. “But it can also redirect vehicles into traffic. So these are factors we kind of have to weigh.”  Motorists who will be traveling that area of US Route 15 during the overnight hours next week are urged to be patient, and pay attention to their driving while in the work zone.  MDOT SHA also says this project is separate from the widening of US Route 15 in Frederick which is fully funded, with construction scheduled to begin in 2026.

The attack was perpetrated by school board member Andrew Kehoe, who was displeased by the rising taxes brought on by the new school, and sour over losing a public election.  Almost 100 years later, the Bath School disaster remains the deadliest school attack in United States history. The son of two people who survived the dynamite attack talked about what happened that day, and what we can learn from it.  Bath Consolidated School ""The Bath School Disaster"" by M.J. Ellsworth  The day of the explosion  George Robson grew up in Bath, a small town northwest of Lansing. His parents, Byron and Arlene, were students at Bath Consolidated School at the time of the disaster. Byron Robson was the senior class president and valedictorian anxious for his graduation ceremony later that week. Arlene Dreyer was nearing the end of her sophomore year.

My mother was very excited because she was going to be his special date at commencement the upcoming Saturday,” George Robson said.  “They had a budding relationship at that point. That day accentuated everything they were going through.”  Just before the explosion, Byron was walking down the second floor hallway of the school. He passed Arlene’s classroom and waved through the glass door. Arlene was working on a paper, and Byron was headed to the church next door where the graduation ceremony was set to take place.  “She turns back to write her paper, and there’s a sudden shudder, and the lights start swinging from the ceiling and the air fills with dust. She looks out the doors where my dad had just walked down the hallway, and there’s blue sky, and there’s no school there,” Robson said.  Advertisement  Her teacher that day was Supt. Emroy E. Huyck. After the explosion, Huyck instructed students not to panic or attempt to jump from the second-story windows. They complied and were rescued when Consumers Energy - which was doing work in town that week - arrived with ladders to help the students escape.  Superintendent Emroy E. Huyck “The Bath School Disaster” by M.J. Ellsworth  “My mother was able to get out, climb down and walk around the other side of the school. She finds that her sister is okay. She was in part of the school that was not affected,” Robson said.  She decided to walk home, which was about three blocks from the school. As she started to cross the road, she saw Andrew Kehoe approaching the school in his Model T.  “She thought he’s coming in to help because he’s on the school board. He knew all about electricity and plumbing and building and everything. So she waits for him to turn and she crosses the road,” Robson said.  Advertisement  As she did, she could see the Kehoe farm on fire about a mile down the road. She then thought Kehoe could be coming to town for help.  “She goes to open the door for her house right there. There’s another shudder, and a piece of steel came through the picture window. That’s when (Kehoe) had driven up to school and blown up his car,” Robson said.  The Bath School after the explosion ""The Bath School Disaster"" By M.J. Ellsworth  The creation of Bath Consolidated School  Bath Consolidated School opened in November 1922. The school replaced a collection of one-room schoolhouses in the area, and educated K-12 students. The 1926 Census counted 314 scholars at the school. For a community the size of Bath, creating a consolidated school was quite the big deal at the time. The school provided transportation and organized education, unlike the small country one-room schoolhouses of the age.  Taxes paid by the community helped build and keep the school functioning. In 1922, they were $12.26 on a thousand dollar valuation; by 1926, they reached $19.80.  Advertisement  Who is Andrew Kehoe?  Andrew P. Kehoe was born Feb. 1, 1872, near Tecumseh, Michigan. One of 13 children, his mother died when he was young. In time his father remarried. Kehoe was not fond of his stepmother, and her fate was a prelude of what would come to those close to Kehoe.  One day when Kehoe was about 14, his stepmother returned home from running errands and proceeded to light their oil stove in the kitchen. The stove had been tampered with, and it exploded, saturating her with oil and setting her ablaze. At first Andrew just stared at her, watching her burn. Then he grabbed a pail of water and threw it on her, exacerbating the situation. She later died from her injuries. Though there was never any trouble made about it, neighbors familiar with the family were of the belief that Andrew knew something was awry with the stove.  Kehoe gradated from Tecumseh High School, then took an electrical engineering course at Michigan State College. While in college he met his future wife, Nellie Price.  Later Kehoe purchased the Price family farm in Bath. Though he was technically a farmer, Kehoe chronically mismanaged his land. He did not follow the traditional practices of the time but rather tried to do every ounce of work with a tractor.  The book titled “The Bath School Disaster” by M.J. Ellsworth covers the story of Andrew Kehoe, the Bath community and the victims’ lives in great detail.  “No matter how much Kehoe worked on machinery, he was never seen dirty or greasy. If he got greasy, he would go to the house and clean up,” Ellsworth wrote.  At the time, farmers often used dynamite to move stumps and boulders from their fields. Kehoe was known for his frequent use of the explosive for stump blasting.  Kehoe Home ""The Bath School Disaster"" By M.J. Ellsworth  After moving to Bath in the spring of 1919, Kehoe and his neighbors - the Hartes - had a friendly relationship. Mrs. Harte often took Nellie on errands since the Kehoes were without a car in those years. But that friendliness didn’t last long.  “Mrs. Harte had a little fox terrier dog of which she thought a great deal, but it had a habit of running out on the lawn and barking. It never went into the road. It came up missing in March, 1920, and they looked all over the farm for it, but they couldn’t find it. She went over and asked Mr. Kehoe if he had seen anything of her dog. He said that it was burying a bone beside his road fence and he shot the d- nuisance. The dog never went into Kehoe’s yard, but it must have annoyed him by barking on the lawn,” wrote M.J. Ellsworth.  In 1922, Kehoe began to complain about taxes being too high. In 1923, the school board bought five acres for an athletic field and electricity purposes. Taxes went up to $18.80 for that year. This enraged Kehoe. He told neighbors if he were to join the school board, he would cut down the taxes. At an annual school meeting in 1924, Kehoe was nominated and elected to act as trustee for a term of three years. He was appointed treasurer for a one-year period.  During this time, he had considerable trouble with the rest of the school board, as he refused to give or take on any subject. He wanted his way, and if there were disagreements, he would make a motion to adjourn the sessions. He very rarely voted the same as other members on the school board.  He felt serious animosity toward Supt. Huyck. Many times he tried to have him fired, dismissed him from meetings and even attempted to refuse him any vacation time.  In the spring of 1925, the elected township clerk died. The township board appointed Kehoe to act as clerk until the election the following spring. At that election, Kehoe ran for the position and was defeated, likely due to his behavior on the school board.  Losing the election - coupled with his disdain for the school taxes - proved to be the last straw, and he soon forged a plan to destroy all he could.  The explosions  On the day of the disaster, Kehoe set off almost concurrent explosions at his farm and at Bath Consolidated School. His devices destroyed the farm’s buildings and the north wing of the school building.  “He was going to have his way at any cost,” Ellsworth wrote. “He cut wire fences on the farm and put dynamite in his tractor so that it blew all to pieces while the tool shed was burning. All the stock he had at this time was two horses. They were tied in the barn and their feet were wired together so that rescuing them during the fire would be impossible.”  During the summer of 1926, Kehoe did repair work at the school, allowing him unsupervised extended access to the premises, and affording him knowledge of the building. Kehoe was able to hide dynamite in the lower floors of the school.  The last board meeting he attended was May 5, 1927, just 13 days before the tragedy.  Kehoe Home after fire ""The Bath School Disaster"" By M.J. Ellsworth  As rescuers began working at the school after the first explosion, Kehoe drove up to the schoolyard. He had filled his car with dynamite as well as farming tools, metal and nails to act as shrapnel. He shot at the pile, triggering an explosion that killed Kehoe plus four others, including Huyck.  During the rescue and recovery efforts, searchers discovered an additional 500 pounds of unexploded dynamite in the south wing of the school.  Explosives found in Bath School ""The Bath School Disaster"" By M.J. Ellsworth  Note left by Kehoe “The Bath School Disaster” by M.J. Ellsworth  The aftermath  Many families lost children that day. In a tragedy of this magnitude, moving on looks different for everyone involved. For George Robson’s parents, silence was the easiest way.  “You can imagine how traumatic it was. Thirty-eight small children are killed in this school, on the last day of school, and it could have been the entire school because they ended up taking out over 500 pounds of dynamite that did not go off. But they never talked about it,” Robson said. “They moved on to their careers. My mother became a very successful teacher for the rest of her life. My dad had various other jobs. I’m sure it affected them emotionally, tremendously. But boy, it didn’t stop them from doing what they were intending to do with their lives.”  Robson speculates his parents never talked about the incident because they - and the country at large - had experienced a lot of turmoil in their childhood. World War I, the Spanish Flu and then the school disaster were events that affected them deeply and that became opportunities to become stronger.  Today, Robson gives presentations at libraries, universities and community events to tell the story of the Bath School disaster in hopes that people won’t forget the resiliency of the small Michigan town. The violence experienced in schools today is frequently mentioned by patrons.  “There was a distinct and concrete effort to move on, and to never talk about it after,” Robson said about the Bath School Disaster.  “What comes up sometimes in these presentations is, ‘How can we talk about the gun violence in schools now?’ ” Robson said. “The main thing I concentrate on is the fact that he had a psychopathic personality, and he never should have had access to deadly materials.  “We have that in our current culture, and we can address that, like we did with that subject, we could have great success with it. There certainly are comparisons that we can learn from, that’s for sure.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LjlhbmQxMG5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTgvc29uLW9mLWNvdXBsZS13aG8tc3Vydml2ZWQtdGhlLWJhdGgtc2Nob29sLWRpc2FzdGVyLXNheXMtd2UtY2FuLWxlYXJuLWZyb20tdGhlLXBhc3Qv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Shiba Inu cryptocurrency project, rooted in the popular Shiba Inu dog meme, presents itself as a rival to Dogecoin and runs on the Ethereum blockchain. The Shiba Inu (SHIB) ecosystem comprises three unique tokens, each serving a particular purpose within the project.  SHIB, as the main token, acts as a decentralized, community-driven currency that is accessible to millions of users around the world. Having launched on the Ethereum blockchain in late 2020, SHIB has since gained global attention and can be used for payment at various locations, either directly or through intermediary services.  BONE serves as the governance token in the ecosystem, with a total supply of 250 million. BONE enables the Shib Army to participate in decision-making by voting on proposals through the Doggy DAO. Additionally, BONE establishes the groundwork for Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s own Layer 2 network.  The third token, LEASH, has a limited supply of 107,646 and offers exclusive benefits to dedicated supporters of the ecosystem. LEASH holders have experienced advantages such as increased BONE rewards for providing liquidity to ShibaSwap, exclusive rights to mint Shiboshi NFTs, and priority access to land sales within the “SHIB: The Metaverse project.”  Shibarium, a layer 2 blockchain, has been developed to overcome Ethereum’s limitations, including slow speeds and high transaction costs.

It boasts a reboot-based story, with Liu Kang having sent the timeline back further than we’ve ever seen it go in franchise history. There’s an all-new fighting system named Kameo, a fresh roster of fighters, and more gore and violent combat than you can shake a stick at. With Mortal Kombat 1 having finally been announced, 2023 officially becomes one of the best years on record for the fighting games esports scene.  We’re mere days away from the launch of Street Fighter 6, and on September 19th, we’ll get access to Mortal Kombat 1. This year, Tekken 8 could also be released, but it may be pushed to early 2024. There are also ongoing rumours circulating of a brand-new product called ‘Disney Domination’, which is supposedly going to be a hyper-ambitious competitor to Super Smash. There’s a new King of Fighters game, the first AEW title, a better-than-ever WWE 2K game, and many more fighting games coming in 2023.  It’s a brilliant year for the fighting scene.  Mortal Kombat 1 Looks Fantastic  It was only an early reveal trailer, but what we’ve seen of Mortal Kombat 1 already looks brilliant. In the video, we’re treated to tranquil scenes that are quickly shattered by intense, graphic violence – and it’s only going to get more brutal as time goes on. There’s the regular line-up of someone of the most recognisable characters and fighters, but this will supposedly be the largest roster in Mortal Kombat history.  There’s also a ‘secondary roster’ of fighters known as ‘Kameo’ characters. New for Mortal Kombat 1, the Kameo system will see players pick AI-controlled characters that can make an appearance at opportune moments during a fight to lend a hand and present collaborative opportunities.  Here’s the trailer:  There Is Always Something Worth Fighting For  This year (and into 2024), fans of fighting games are going to be spoilt for choice. It’s a series of changes that are set to impact the esports scene for fighting games immeasurably, with competitors needing to learn the ropes on three top-tier new titles: Street Fighter 6, Tekken 8, and now Mortal Kombat 1.  There’s better technology powering these games, too. It was recently revealed that Street Fighter 6 will boast rollback netcode, which means that fighting will be as low-latency as possible, making for more accurate combat online – which is a massive win for Street Fighter esports tournaments being played online. It’s a similar story across other platforms, with Tekken 8 and Mortal Kombat 1 both boasting new, advanced, and enhanced features and technology.  For fans of the genre, there will be plenty of titles to pick from going forward. It may be a few years before any of these games resurface again, so it’s best to enjoy them while they’re here and spend a long time perfecting your skills in each game.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG9ydHMubmV0L25ld3MvbW9ydGFsLWtvbWJhdC0xLXJldmVhbGVkL9IBOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG9ydHMubmV0L25ld3MvbW9ydGFsLWtvbWJhdC0xLXJldmVhbGVkLz9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"explosion","2017-12-03","Not Discerned","{""Nashville"", ""Tennessee"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 22:32:00","Jimmie Allen addressed his wife, who is divorcing him, in an Instagram post Thursday afternoon, publicly apologizing to her for what he continues to characterize as a consensual “affair,” and what a woman who used to be one of his managers claims in a lawsuit was sexual assault and rape.  “I want to publicly apologize to my wife, Alexis, for humiliating her with my affair,” Allen writes in the post. “I’m embarrassed that my choices have brought shame on her. That’s something she did not deserve at all. I also want to apologize to my children for being a poor example of a man and a father.” (Allen’s wife is pregnant with their third child; he also has a child from a previous relationship.)  The country star does not mention or allude to the seriousness of the allegations in the lawsuit against him or in an investigative piece published by Variety. He uses his latest statement to characterize his involvement with the Jane Doe in question as “temptations” he was not able to “withstand” as “a victim of my weaknesses.” He also contends “this business” put him in the position of succumbing to weakness.  “This business takes so much from you,” Allen wrote. “It’s full of temptations that can cripple you and ruin everything you’ve built. I’m ashamed that I wasn’t strong enough to withstand them. I will no longer be a victim of my weaknesses.”  In conclusion, Allen said, “I challenge everyone to seek help when they need it. Do not be afraid of your weakness, surround yourself with people that WILL help you. Be Blessed.” He signed off on the message with emoji of praying hands and a clenched fist.  It marked the first substantial public statement Allen had made since he released a statement to Variety just before Jane Doe’s lawsuit went public, at which time he said: “I acknowledge that we had a sexual relationship — one that lasted for nearly two years. During that time, she never once accused me of any wrongdoing, and she spoke of our relationship and friendship as being something she wanted to continue indefinitely. Only after things ended between us, did she hire a lawyer to reach out and ask for money, which leads me to question her motives….”  In response to that statement, Jane Doe’s attorneys denied that she ever asked Allen’s camp for money prior to filing the suit.  In a vaguer, earlier statement this week, Allen had taken to his Instagram Story on Wednesday to post messages with religious overtones. “We Gonna Be Alright. This Too Shall Pass,” Allen wrote, followed by a screenshot of a song by a Christian group, For King & Country, over which he wrote the message “God only knows … He knows!”  (The phrase “We Gonna Be Alright” is a reference to his new single, “Be Alright.” It drops to No. 59 on Billboard’s Country Airplay chart in this, its third charting week, after peaking at No. 57 last week.)  Reaction against Allen has been swift from those who have most recently been working with him. He was suspended from his record company, BBR, his agency, UTA, and his current management company, The Familie. His publicity firm, Full Coverage Communications, terminated business with the star. And the Country Music Association removed him from the bill for the upcoming CMA Music Festival. Allen no longer has any tour dates listed on his website, although Ticketmaster is still selling tickets for a handful of upcoming Allen shows, while others are marked as canceled.  In the civil lawsuit against Allen, his former manager-producer Ash Bowers and Wide Open Music, filed May 11 with the United States District Court of Tennessee, Allen was sued for sexual battery, assault, false imprisonment, sex trafficking and emotional distress. Bowers and Wide Open Music were additionally sued for gross negligence and participating in a venture engaged in sex trafficking, among other counts.  Jane Doe was a young woman who had recently graduated magna cum laude from Vanderbilt University, with a brief stopover at UTA’s Nashville office, when she went to work for Allen’s then-management, Wide Open Music, becoming the star’s day-to-day manager. Doe says she was fired by Bowers in retaliation after bringing an alleged pattern of sexual assault that she says went on for a year and a half to the manager’s attention. Bowers says she was let go because there was no longer a role for her after the company quietly severed ties with Allen after she discussed what was happening with the manager last fall.  In her lawsuit, Jane Doe alleges that Allen raped her while choking her, sexually abused her at red lights when she drove him to and from business events and looked at porn on her work computer. She also says she lost her virginity to the artist after unaccountably blacking out while they were together. Jane Doe told Variety that she said “no” and tried to push Allen away during many sexual interactions, and after she had been allegedly coerced and forced to have sexual intercourse with Allen, she would regularly bleed, cry uncontrollably and run to the bathroom to vomit. Despite these signs, she says Allen failed to acknowledge her physical and emotional pain.  Allen videotaped multiple sexual encounters “to blackmail her to stay silent,” according to the suit, while she says he insisted Jane Doe surrender her own phone and other electronics when they were together.  “I have to tell this story because there’s no way I would let my daughter near a situation like this,” the plaintiff told Variety. “My life has been turned inside out because of Jimmie Allen.”  Allen’s wife, Alexis, has been mostly quiet since they jointly announced their impending divorce. Just prior to the lawsuit being filed, she posted a couple of statements, asking to be left in peace: “Continue the chaos while I heal in peace,” she wrote, and: “My Instagram isn’t a help line so please stop messaging me about any third parties.”  On Thursday, though, screenshots emerged reported to be of a statement Alexis posted and then deleted on her Instagram, in which she seems to be taking aim both at her husband and his accuser, or accusers. It read: “Imagine being a woman who is so f***** up mentally emotionally and pursues a man who is married with 3 children & a pregnant wife. Imagine. I could never.” The statement added, “Y’all can kiss my ass with the ‘estranged wife’ narrative. I really wish I was only talking about one female.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9tdXNpYy9uZXdzL2ppbW1pZS1hbGxlbi1hcG9sb2dpemVzLXdpZmUtYWZmYWlyLXNleHVhbC1hc3NhdWx0LWxhd3N1aXQtMTIzNTYxODE5OC_SAW5odHRwczovL3ZhcmlldHkuY29tLzIwMjMvbXVzaWMvbmV3cy9qaW1taWUtYWxsZW4tYXBvbG9naXplcy13aWZlLWFmZmFpci1zZXh1YWwtYXNzYXVsdC1sYXdzdWl0LTEyMzU2MTgxOTgvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Nikola Jokic had his 13th playoff triple-double with 23 points, 17 rebounds and a dozen assists for the Nuggets, who have never been this close to reaching the NBA Finals in their history.  Game 3 is Saturday night at Crypto.com Arena, where LeBron James and the Lakers are 8-0 in the playoffs.  Jamal's jumpers go down  Murray missed 12 of his 17 shots through three quarters but found his touch in the fourth, going 6 for 7, including four 3-pointers and fueling a 15-1 run that gave Denver a 96-84 lead.  Just like in Game 1, the Lakers didn't go down easily. They pulled to three points on Austin Reaves' jumper before Murray sank two free throws with 12 seconds left and Bruce Brown stole the ball from James, then dribbled out the final 8 seconds.  The Nuggets improved to 41-8 at home, best in the NBA, including 8-0 in the playoffs.  Lakers fade in Mile High  James and Reaves both scored 22 for Los Angeles. Anthony Davis scored 18 after pouring in 40 in the opener and Rui Hachimura scored 21 points off the bench.  For much of the night, it appeared as though the Lakers would wrest home-court advantage from the Nuggets, who are the top seed for the first time in their history. The Lakers won the series openers at Memphis and Golden State to reach the conference championship.  The outstanding defense Hachimura played on Jokic in the fourth quarter of the Lakers' loss in Game 1 led many to believe coach Darvin Ham would start Hachimura to try to stymie the Nuggets' star center from the start. But instead he came off the bench again.  And what a spark he provided, sinking all seven of his first-half shots for a game-high 17 points at the half. His 3-pointer and pull-up jumper sparked a 9-0 run to open the second quarter and put the Lakers in charge despite slow starts from James and Davis, each of whom were held to two points in the first quarter.  James' breakaway dunk made it 68-57 midway through the third quarter, but the Nuggets got back into it with a 10-0 run and took their first lead since the first quarter when Murray's 3 made it 84-83.  His step-back 3 at the 7-minute mark made it 87-83. Another 3 made it 99-87, and he sank seven of eight free throws in the final minute.  Tip-ins  Lakers: Los Angeles made 23 of 26 free throws. ...

In response to competition from Costco, he said its competitors would be the likes of food wholesalers such as Gilmours, especially in major cities.  “I don’t think they’ll be a direct competitor,” Duke told shareholders.  “I don’t see them being a big seller of Nike and Adidas but they will be a competitor, especially in Auckland and Wellington.”  “If you’re in the food business, you’d be really worried,” Duke said.  Costco opened its doors in Westgate, Auckland last September while Ikea has not opened a local store yet.  The Herald previously reported that Ikea planned to open its first NZ store in Mt Wellington, Auckland in December 2024.  He assured shareholders the company does not plan to switch to self-service in stores, when a shareholder told Duke: “Don’t do self-checkouts.”  “I promise you when it comes up, I’ll vote against it,” Duke responded.  Another shareholder’s concern was the lack of outlets in regional locations such as Masterton.  Duke said the company is focused on refurbishing existing stores but increasing demand in smaller areas meant Rebel Sport stores may be on the cards for greater Wellington.  He said decreases in sales across Auckland and Wellington have shown the bite from the cost of living crisis but flexibility across the group’s homewares and sports brands meant sales were likely to stay consistent.  Resilience  Group chair Dame Rosanne Meo said the pandemic has shown the company’s ability to survive adverse economic conditions.  “Our business model and operations were thoroughly stress-tested by the pandemic,” she told shareholders.  She said the group’s results showed the company was robust and resilient.  “We have specialised streams of retailing, not departmental which is struggling globally.”  Meo said homeware and sports goods were not just for “fanatics” but for day-to-day use.  Duke said Ikea are “terrific retailers” but would not be direct competition to Briscoe Group. Photo / NZME  “Explosion in crime”  Chief financial officer Geoff Scowcroft said $3m in goods were stolen every year from its stores, alongside increasingly abusive behaviour towards staff.  He said a tight labour market, increased wages across two consecutive years and an “explosion in crime” had driven up operational costs.  Scowcroft said the retailer suffered seven ram raids and 12 internal store attacks in the last year.  “There is increasing abuse and aggressive behaviour in-store faced by our team,” he told shareholders.  “Our team have to face this behaviour day in and day out.”  The group implemented security measures like licence plate recognition, bollards, silent alarms and high-quality security cameras, Scowcroft said.  He said the company was also eager to implement facial recognition systems to bolster security measures.  Duke said the company was spending an extra $1m a year on security.  He told the Mike Hosking Breakfast Show on Newstalk ZB the current retail crime situation was the worst he’d ever seen.  The year ahead  Scowcroft said: “We aren’t under any illusions at all about how difficult it is” in the retail space.  Supply chain general manager Darren Porteous said the company was setting up two major distribution centres in the North and South Islands.  Briscoe intended to use these for direct shipment from suppliers and to manage online sales.  A sustainability strategy planned for the next year will also include solar power and rain catchments in a move to assure customers.  Duke’s response was less than enthusiastic: “I’m not looking forward to paying for it”.  Chief operations officer Andrew Scott said consumers wanted NZ businesses to stock sustainable products and now chose to shop with retailers “on the basis of doing the right thing”.  The company planned to release its first climate change disclosure report and monitor supply chain ethics.  Duke said he expected NZ retail to be sensitive to deteriorating economic conditions and “political uncertainty” ahead of this year’s election.  “We don’t underestimate the difficulty of the trading environment. It will be difficult to replicate our record sales,” he told shareholders.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uemhlcmFsZC5jby5uei9idXNpbmVzcy9icmlzY29lLWJvc3Mtcm9kLWR1a2UtcHJlcGFyZXMtdG8tbGlmdC1nYW1lLXRvLWNvbXBldGUtd2l0aC1jb3N0Y28tYW5kLWlrZWEvUjNGQVNKQVhEQkg3N0VRNktKUVRJWEhWVEkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"explosion","1945-08-06","Not Discerned","{""Hiroshima"", ""Hiroshima"", ""Japan""}","Fri 19 May 2023 06:47:37","As the G7 summit takes place in Japan, survivors of the 1945 atomic bomb caution leaders about the human cost of nuclear weapons.  Hiroshima, Japan – “It looked like a bright orange light, like the first sunrise of the year,” says Sadae Kasaoka, remembering the moment when the first nuclear bomb to ever be used was dropped by the United States on the Japanese city of Hiroshima.  Now 90, she was 12 years old that August day at the tail end of World War II, but she still remembers it vividly.  Sadae was home alone with her grandmother. When the blast hit, she was pushed against the wall by the massive force of the explosion and covered in broken glass. The two then fled into an air raid shelter for safety.  Sadae pauses, her voice trembling as she goes on to recall the events of August 6, 1945. “A neighbour told us the whole city was on fire,” she says.  For hours she did not know whether her parents had survived. When her brother brought her father’s body home, he was alive, but so severely burned that she could not recognise him.  “He was all black. His eyes were popping out. Finally, I recognised him by his voice. He said ‘Give me water’. And he asked me to go looking for my mother,” Sadae says, taking a breath. “Someone told me you shouldn’t give them water, so I did not give him any water, but that is something I still regret deeply.”  Sadae’s father died two days later. The following day she found out her mother was killed and already cremated along with many other victims.  The exact number of deaths from the uranium bomb remains unclear to this day, with a large gap between the lowest and highest estimates. The City of Hiroshima reports that by the end of 1945 up to approximately 140,000 people – out of a population of 350,000 – had died either in the explosion itself or from the effects of acute radiation poisoning. Most were civilians.  Days later, on August 9, a larger plutonium bomb was then dropped on Nagasaki – some 400km (248 miles) away from Hiroshima. According to the Nobel Peace Prize-winning International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN), around another 74,000 people lost their lives there by December 1945. Many of those who survived suffered from long-term illnesses.  The first and last atomic bombs ever dropped on a civilian population, the Hiroshima and Nagasaki attacks are often seen as a uniquely horrible moment in human history. But with countries building up weapons capabilities and threats of nuclear options in Russia’s war against Ukraine, many fear that humanity is not doing enough to avoid repeating itself. With the Group of Seven (G7) summit taking place in Hiroshima this week, some survivors see it as an opportunity to remind world leaders what the real costs are.  ‘All my friends died’  Toshiko Tanaka grew up in Hiroshima. When the explosion hit, the then-six-year-old suffered burns as well as exposure to radiation, but miraculously survived.  Today the 84-year-old uses a stick to help herself walk, but otherwise seems to be in good health. However, the traumatic memories of that fateful day will forever be imprinted in her mind.  It was a school day, Toshiko remembers. On their way to class, she and a friend noticed a plane overhead. When someone yelled “enemy”, Toshiko looked up to the sky. Then she saw the light.  “I instinctively covered my face,” she says, recalling that she used her right arm to protect herself. That night she developed a high fever. “I don’t remember much. I lost consciousness.”  One of her most vivid memories from that time was the smell of burning corpses in the days after the explosion. The authorities had started cremating the bodies of those who died.  “I was traumatised,” she says. “All my friends from school died and for a very long time I couldn’t speak about what happened.”  When she was 70, Toshiko went on a boat trip organised by the Japanese non-profit Peaceboat, an initiative inviting survivors of the atomic bomb on a journey around the world telling their stories. That is when she realised she had to speak up and finally share her testimony, she says.  Today she wants everyone to know how dangerous nuclear weapons are to mankind and the unimaginable suffering they cause. “I want our leaders to see what happened in Hiroshima and imagine what would happen to your family, to your friends, if a bomb was dropped on them.”  Toshiko started travelling to the US and learned a little English to tell her story; she’s made 10 such trips in the past seven years.  She speaks as a “hibakusha” – a Japanese term for those affected by the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. At the last count in 2021, an estimated 42,000 hibakushas were still living in Hiroshima, according to the Japanese Ministry of Health. The average age then was 84. Soon what happened in Hiroshima will pass beyond living memory.  ‘Credible, actionable plan’ for disarmament  In 2016, Barack Obama became the first sitting US president to meet with survivors at Hiroshima’s Peace Memorial Park during a historic trip. This year, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has invited his fellow G7 leaders to his family’s native city – a summit that includes another visit to the park, where the Atomic Bomb Dome, the only structure left standing in the area after 1945, remains.  US President Joe Biden, along with leaders from France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada and Italy, will join to commemorate those who lost their lives in 1945. Although the attacks remain the only use of nuclear weapons in history, three of these visiting G7 countries have their own, while others host them on their territory.  Daniel Högsta, the interim executive director of ICAN, wants to see leaders of the G7 commit to a “credible, actionable plan” on nuclear disarmament, one that involves a treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons. “Anything less than that would be insulting to the hibakusha,” he tells Al Jazeera. “It would also be a failure of leadership.”  For Toshiko, the visit could not be more crucial at a time when some say the world is closer to a nuclear war than it has been in decades.  “I want them to really pay attention to what happens when you use a nuclear weapon,” she says. “There is a war in Ukraine now and this summit should not be a place where you make military preparations.” She wants this meeting to be about finding a way back to peace.  While walking through the Peace Memorial Park, Toshiko shares that as a child she used to swim in the Motoyasu River between the park and the iconic Atomic Bomb Dome, which used to be part of Hiroshima Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall – an exhibition space.  But she doesn’t like coming to the area anymore. It reminds her that it was once a bustling city centre of Hiroshima. “Then all of a sudden it was gone,” she says, explaining the unease she feels being there now.  However, she thinks it is important for the world to know what happened in this place. So does her fellow hibakusha Sadae, who now gives talks at the nearby Peace Memorial Museum. “Nuclear weapons should not exist, they should not be built and that’s why we are raising our voice,” she answers when asked about her message to the world leaders coming to her city.  August 6, 1945 did not just change the city of Hiroshima and affect the lives of hundreds of thousands of survivors. It also changed the world.  World War II ended with Japan’s formal surrender on September 2 that year, nearly 80 years ago. Yet the horrors of what happened and the dangers of nuclear war feel ever more present – especially to those who remember first-hand one of the darkest days in history.

The full text of the letter can be found here and below.  Dear Secretary Austin and General Milley:  On March 8, 2023, the House Foreign Affairs Committee (HFAC) held a hearing examining the catastrophic withdrawal from Afghanistan. During the hearing, HFAC heard testimony from witnesses on the scene of the August 26, 2021, terrorist attack at Abbey Gate, which killed 13 American servicemembers and wounded another 45, also killing approximately 170 Afghan civilians. Testimony during the hearing raises serious questions regarding the events leading up to the attack, which must be answered.  Marine Sergeant Tyler Vargas-Andrews, a sniper badly wounded in the explosion, testified that his sniper team believed they identified the suicide bomber responsible for the attack earlier in the day. According to his testimony, Sergeant Vargas-Andrews and his team did not eliminate the threat due to their leadership’s uncertainty as to who held the authority to approve or deny engagement.  Battlefield decisions are often made in a cloud, but in honor of the lives lost and those still living following that terrible day, it is incumbent we learn whether events were avoidable and if uncertain procedures, broken lines of communication, or worse, contributed to the lack of engagement.  To provide Congress a better understanding of these events, we request the following no later than June 2, 2023:  A detailed description of the response to the request for engagement authority by Sergeant Vargas-Andrews’ sniper team, including fully detailing each step in its consideration, the request’s outcome, and the reason for any decisions; All documents and communications referencing or relating to the events at Abbey Gate on August 26, 2021, including but not limited to: All documents and communications referencing or relating to the request by Sergeant Vargas-Andrews’ sniper team for engagement authority, or any other such request by other servicemembers; All documents, communications, or intelligence products referencing or relating to the identity of the perpetrator(s) and planner(s) of the Abbey Gate attack; All documents and communications referencing or relating to the Rules of Engagement in effect at the time of the Abbey Gate attack; All video, audio, and/or photographs of the events at and around Abbey Gate on August 26, 2021, including, but not limited to, those from U.S. government equipment (raid cameras, drones, phones, etc.) as well as personal devices of servicemembers and eyewitnesses (phones, cameras, GoPros, etc); and, All messaging and/or chat room logs in the possession of the Department of Defense (text messages, ChatSurfer logs, etc.) relating to engaging with threats in the vicinity of Hamid Karzai International Airport (“HKIA”) between August 1st and September 31st, 2021; and, Concerning the “Department of Defense Afghanistan After Action Review: January 2020–August 2021” (AAR) and the November 8, 2022, Memorandum for the Record from Secretary Austin (MFR) Footnotes in the AAR, all of which were omitted from the copies of the AAR received by the Committee on Armed Services; and, Transcripts of all interviews conducted during and in furtherance of production of the AAR.

It's the tallest and fastest in Canada boasting an initial drop of 80 degrees while reaching speeds of 148 km/h. (Randy Risling/Toronto Star via Getty Images) (Randy Risling via Getty Images)  You may want to think twice about choosing the front seat of a roller coaster after a collision between Canada's Wonderland Leviathon roller coaster and a bird left thrill seekers covered in blood and feathers on Tuesday.  Toronto man Hubert Hsu thought he was making a bold choice by choosing the front row — something he typically wouldn't do, Hsu told media.  As the coaster climbed its way to the peak of one of the ride's many loops, Hsu says what appeared to be a pigeon made direct contact with the front of the car he was in.  RELATED: York Police relaunch Operation Beehave after mayhem at Canada's Wonderland  “I looked down and saw blood and my hands and my face. There was a feather on my hand, and feathers on the girl next to me’s shirt. It seemed like the coaster car hit the bird and then it sort of exploded on us,"" Hsu said to media.  Left in a state of shock and confusion over what had just occurred, Hsu said that Wonderland staff did not take any action until other riders on the coaster flagged down ride operators.  The riders were then safely able to dismount the ride once the coaster came to a stop.  “I asked for wipes, and they gave us those brown, disposable paper towel rolls like you see in industrial schools,” Hsu said to media.

Forthcoming AI regulations – including the EU AI Act and the EU Liability Directives – and their interplay with existing laws, such as the GDPR, were also discussed.  The masterclass (17 May) was hosted by technology partner David Kirton and focused on the central role in-house lawyers will play in their organisations' implementation of AI technologies.  William Fry has hosted a masterclass on artificial intelligence (AI) law for in-house counsel at its Dublin office.  Rachel Hayes pointed out that, while AI was a novel technology, it essentially processed data, and the underlying rules remained unchanged.  Robust data governance  Therefore, it was crucial to establish robust data governance, ensuring safe implementation of this technology, and compliance with forthcoming legislation when enacted.  David Cullen tackled liability issues that might arise from the use of AI, and the importance of reviewing contracts with an eye to IP and liability considerations.  ""As AI technology evolves, so too must our understanding and application of the law,” said David Kirton.  Barry Scannell added that the ‘explosion in AI tech’ had been triggered by an ‘explosion in big data’.  “AI is trained on data, and its growth is due to the massive amounts of data now available for it to feed on.  “By 2025, we will be producing as much data every three minutes as all of human civilisation did up to the year 2003,” he added.

(Dakota News Now) - The explosion of pickleball across the country hasn’t slowed down in recent years. If anything, it’s only growing faster.  Nationwide, there’s over 36 million pickleball players, according to Pickleheads. While South Dakota is catching up on the explosion in popularity, the state is seeing it’s own rise in the sport.  “Pickleball is well on its way to being one of the largest sports in the country by participation, which we couldn’t be more happy about,” Pickleheads co-founder Brandon Mackie said.  Active Generations Fitness Manager Jenny Centra said they’re hosting open courts multiple times a week, with a growing number of players out each time.  “We have new people coming in on the daily, at least five to six people new every day,” Centra said.  Centra said it’s still growing in popularity because it’s easy to pick up, and something that every age group can do.  “You have all sorts of fitness levels that come out here too. People that have never played tennis or never heard of pickleball that will come out because somebody said, ‘Oh, you’ve got to try it at Active Generations, you can get lessons,’” Centra said.  While the number of permanent courts in South Dakota is well below other states, the sport is growing. Mackie said there’s around 50 permanent courts across the state, and they’re looking to help host competitions and tournaments in the area with their website as a platform.  “To build some free tools for pickleball organizers. To mange their groups, to put on tournaments, to do fun events. We’re trying to do a few in cities all over the U.S. this summer, and Sioux Falls is definitely high on the list. We think there’s a great pickleball scene, Sioux Falls Area Pickleball club. There’s some good organizations and great facilities,” Mackie said.  Mackie said soon enough, competitive pickleball could be commonplace, and South Dakota could be a part of that movement.  “The sport of pickleball is becoming more and more competitive, there’s a lot of great players out there.

Prime Video  Thinking back to her upbringing, Jill adds of her family: ""We were part of IBLP as early as I can remember.""  More accusations fly throughout the trailer, as one man alleges that IBLP founder Bill Gothard ""turned every father into a cult leader and every home into an island.""

"explosion","2020-05-17","Not Discerned","{""Stockholm"", ""Stockholm"", ""Sweden""}","Thu 18 May 2023 22:40:00","Newswise — Astronomers have, for the initial instance, witnessed radio waves released by a Type Ia supernova, an explosion deriving from a white dwarf star, offering vital insights into comprehending white dwarf explosions.  A Type Ia (One-A) supernova denotes the nuclear burst of a white dwarf star. This supernova category enjoys widespread recognition; astronomers employ these supernovae to gauge cosmological distances and the Universe's expansion. Nevertheless, the explosion mechanism behind Type Ia supernovae remains poorly understood. Unaccompanied white dwarfs do not undergo explosions, suggesting that mass accumulation from a neighboring companion star contributes to triggering the outburst. The amassed mass typically consists of the companion star's outer layer, predominantly composed of hydrogen. However, it has been contemplated that a white dwarf could also accumulate helium from a companion star that shed its hydrogen-rich outer layer.  While the white dwarf siphons matter from its companion star, not all of the substance converges onto the white dwarf. Instead, a portion of it coalesces into a cluster of circumstellar material encircling the binary star system. Anticipated are shockwaves generated by the detonation of a white dwarf within this circumstellar material, which would stimulate atoms and induce the emission of potent radio waves. Despite numerous instances of Type Ia supernovae erupting within such circumstellar clouds, astronomers had hitherto not witnessed any accompanying radio wave emissions associated with this specific type of supernova.  A multinational team of researchers, including scientists from Stockholm University and the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, meticulously observed a Type Ia supernova that erupted in 2020. Their findings unveiled that this particular supernova was enveloped by circumstellar material predominantly composed of helium. Additionally, they successfully detected radio waves emanating from the supernova. By comparing the strength of the observed radio waves with theoretical models, they deduced that the progenitor white dwarf star had been accumulating material at a rate equivalent to about 1/1000th of the Sun's mass per year. Remarkably, this discovery marks the first verified instance of a Type Ia supernova ignited by mass accretion from a companion star characterized by an outer layer primarily comprised of helium.  The detection of radio waves originating from a helium-rich Type Ia supernova holds the promise of enhancing our comprehension of the explosion mechanism and the pre-supernova conditions associated with this type of event. Building upon this significant breakthrough, the team intends to conduct further investigations to explore the presence of radio emissions in other instances of Type Ia supernovae. This ambitious endeavor aims to shed light on the evolutionary processes that culminate in these explosive events, further advancing our understanding of their underlying dynamics.  These results appeared as Kool et al. “A radio-detected Type Ia supernova with helium-rich circumstellar material” in the journal Nature on May 17, 2023.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3aXNlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy90eXBlLWlhLXN1cGVybm92YS1maXJzdC1yYWRpby13YXZlLWRldGVjdGlvbtIBTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3aXNlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy90eXBlLWlhLXN1cGVybm92YS1maXJzdC1yYWRpby13YXZlLWRldGVjdGlvbg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"explosion","2023-10-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 10:55:38","A courtroom battle has erupted over the estate of one of the victims of the Creeslough tragedy.  Farmer Hugh Kelly (59) was one of 10 people who when an explosion ripped through a petrol station in the Co Donegal village on October 7th.  Now a row has erupted between a nephew of Mr Kelly and his partner over the deceased’s home and other lands at Bishop’s Island, Castledoe, Creeslough.  Documents read out at Letterkenny Circuit Court heard the late Mr Kelly’s partner, Linda Gallagher, said she is the beneficiary of the last will and testament, dated November 30th, 2006.  Ms Gallagher is seeking an interlocutory injunction against a Mr Kelly’s nephew, Josie Kelly, who she claims is illegally occupying the property.  Judge John Aylmer heard Ms Gallagher attended the property on October 15th, 2022, just a week after her partner had been killed, and discovered Josie Kelly had “wrongfully or illegally entered the dwelling and changed the locks”.  A locksmith was called and a voice was heard inside the property, which Ms Gallagher recognised as Josie Kelly, but the locksmith could not gain entry.  The details were outlined by Ms Gallagher’s barrister, Gareth McGrory, instructed by solicitor Frank Dorrian, who alleged Josie Kelly had unlawfully and wrongfully trespassed and accessed the dwelling.  It was also alleged that he also placed padlocks on the gates and put a donkey on the land while Ms Gallagher had been in America towards the end of October.  The property was registered in the name of Hugh Kelly, who had lived in the house all his life. The property had been passed to him by his late mother, Sally Kelly.  Injunction  Ms Gallagher sought an injunction to restrain the defendant, or agents acting on his behalf, from trespassing, entering or making use of the lands without the expressed authority of the plaintiff.  Mr McGrory said his client was also seeking an injunction to have the defendant repair any damage caused following the alleged illegal trespass.  Mr McGrory explained Ms Gallagher, who was originally from Indiana in the US, had been in a relationship with the deceased. They both maintained separate houses, but there were several pictures of Ms Gallagher in Mr Hugh Kelly’s home.  The court heard Ms Gallagher had been left “distraught” at Mr Kelly’s sudden death and the deaths of the nine other people in the explosion, as well as suffering “shock, pain and sorrow” following the incident.  Josie Kelly was represented in court by barrister, John McCoy.  Mr Kelly said his late grandfather had wished the property to stay in the Kelly family, claiming he had invested over €100,000 on improvements to the property. He said he had also organised crops of hay and silage on the farmland.  He said he had lived at the property since 1984, save for the years of his marriage, until 2018 when he returned to live on the property.  Mr Kelly claimed none of the plaintiff’s possessions are in the house and that he always had a key and access to the house. “The property is my home,” he added.  Judge John Aylmer asked why Mr Kelly had not exhibited anything in support of his evidence.  “The absence is striking,” the judge said, noting he expected to see evidence that Mr Kelly has been living at the property since 2018 and of the €100,000 he said he had spent.  Mr McCoy said he would take the matter back to his client for further instruction and said there were “parallel proceedings” before the High Court.  Judge Aylmer said he was giving a short opportunity for the defendant to put evidence before the court “that one would expect to support a contention that he has been living there since 2019”.  The matter was adjourned to a future court sitting.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd2VzdGVybnBlb3BsZS5pZS8yMDIzLzA1LzE4L2NvdXJ0LWJhdHRsZS1lcnVwdHMtb3Zlci1lc3RhdGUtb2YtY3JlZXNsb3VnaC1leHBsb3Npb24tdmljdGltL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"explosion","2023-05-14","13:00:00","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 20:35:51","White arrows show the first four appearances of supernova Refsdal, which ""reappeared"" a total of five times in different locations around the same galaxy cluster.  One stellar explosion can't get enough of the spotlight. After showing up five times in images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, the bizarre ""reappearing supernova"" is now helping scientists solve one of astronomy's biggest mysteries: how fast the universe is expanding.  About 13.8 billion years ago, the universe as we know it was just a tiny point in space, containing all the matter in existence. Then, an explosion occurred: the Big Bang . That matter rushed outward — and continues to do so today, gaining speed all the time.  Scientists have known about the universe's expansion for nearly a century. But how fast it's expanding is more of a mystery. Two methods used to measure this rate, dubbed the Hubble constant, disagree. One of those methods relies on ""standard candles"" — using bright objects of known distance to calculate how fast stars and galaxies are rushing away from us. Supernovas, exploding stars that produce copious and steady light, are one of these important benchmarks of distance. The other method uses the ""cosmic microwave background,"" leftover radiation from the Big Bang. The problem is that these two methods produce different answers.  There are myriad explanations for the differing values. Scientists might have failed to take into account repulsive dark energy , a mysterious phenomenon that is seemingly causing the universe to expand at an ever-faster rate. The universe might contain particles we haven't yet identified. Or one of the current calculations might just be wrong.  ""It's a conundrum,"" Patrick Kelly (opens in new tab), an assistant professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Minnesota and lead author of a new study on the Hubble constant, told Live Science.  Enter supernova Refsdal. Kelly first discovered this exploding star in 2014, when it popped up four times, in different positions, around the same galaxy cluster. The supernova appeared in multiple locations because the cluster's extreme gravity bent and reflected the supernova's light, creating what is called a gravitational lens . Based on Refsdal's whack-a-mole act, astronomers predicted that the supernova would also reappear in 2015. Their prediction came true (opens in new tab).  In their new research, Kelly and his colleagues triangulated measurements of the supernova's location to calculate a new value for the Hubble constant. The results, published May 11 in the journal Science (opens in new tab), find a value for the Hubble constant that is much closer to the one derived from the cosmic microwave background, rather than the standard-candle method. According to the new study, the universe is expanding at a rate of about 41.4 miles per second (66.6 kilometers per second) per megaparsec (or for every 3.2 million light-years ).  But the findings don't put an end to the debate; they are just one more method, among many, for studying the expanding universe. ""They don't rule out the [standard candle] supernova value,"" Kelly said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlc2NpZW5jZS5jb20vc3BhY2UvY29zbW9sb2d5L3NjaWVudGlzdHMtd2F0Y2hlZC1hLXJlYXBwZWFyaW5nLXN1cGVybm92YS1leHBsb2RlLTUtdGltZXMtaW4tYS1yb3ctYW5kLWl0LWNvdWxkLWhlbHAtcmV2ZWFsLWhvdy1mYXN0LXRoZS11bml2ZXJzZS1pcy1leHBhbmRpbmfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Lance Gooden, R-Texas, plans to introduce the ""Protecting Federal Funds from Human Trafficking and Smuggling Act of 2023"" to set standards for nonprofit organizations as they gather in border towns to assist with the migrant surge.  ""By ensuring that federal funds are not awarded to organizations that engage in these heinous activities, we can safeguard taxpayer dollars and hold bad actors accountable,"" Gooden told Fox News Digital.  Gooden's bill proposes that NGOs certify federal law compliance with the Office of Management and Budget.  JUDICIARY REPUBLICANS INVESTIGATING DHS FUNDING TO NGOS PROVIDING FREE SERVICES FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS  The House Judiciary Committee member also called on Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to produce a strategy to help NGOs with ""deterring, detecting, reporting and removing aliens.""  The bill comes on the heels of an investigation launched by House Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, Tuesday into DHS-funded NGOs that ""receive hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars through federal grants to provide free food, lodging, and transportation for illegal aliens to be released anywhere they want in the United States.""  Asylum-seekers are arriving primarily from Guatemala, Cuba and Venezuela by the thousands since the end of the Title 42 rapid expulsion policy on May 11. As a result, nonprofit organizations are stepping up to transport, shelter and feed migrants in border towns.  Health and Human Services (HHS) whistleblower Tara Lee Rodas testified during a House hearing in April that migrant children in particular were victims of a ""sophisticated network"" of labor trafficking. The government places unaccompanied minors with sponsors throughout the U.S., some of whom ""view children as commodities and assets to be used for earning income – this is why we are witnessing an explosion of labor trafficking,"" Rodas said.  If enacted, Gooden's bill would apply to nonprofit groups that have been awarded federal funding or an ""agreement, contract, award, or relationship with the Federal Government.""  The bill’s introduction follows a Heritage Foundation report that found many NGOs ""apply for, and receive, taxpayer money to provide processing and transportation services and infrastructure to facilitate the migration of illegal aliens into the interior of the country.""  The Heritage Foundation tracked more than 30,000 mobile devices from NGO facilities to 431 separate U.S. congressional districts across the country during January 2022.  MIGRANT NUMBERS AT SOUTHERN BORDER EXCEEDED 200,000 IN APRIL, PRIOR TO TITLE 42’S EXPIRATION  Gooden’s office said that while the Judiciary and Oversight committees are collecting evidence, ""We know through whistleblowers and migrants themselves that this funding is going toward federal handouts including lodging, transportation, debit cards, and free legal advice.""

For more, read our series overview , which lays out the scale of the problem, explores the humanitarian fallout, and points to some large gaps in the aid sector response.  PANAMÁ, Honduras  Hipólito Rivas was aware that his battles to protect the land could end up getting him killed.  Over the course of the decade he spent running the agricultural cooperative he founded, he had lost numerous friends to shadowy paramilitaries reportedly connected to land-grabbing palm oil corporations in the rural Honduran region where he farmed.  In January 2023, the threats against the 46-year-old farmer intensified: his name appeared on a hitlist, there were intimidating phone calls, men with AK-47s fired rounds off over his house at night. But he refused to stop his struggle, or to leave his community.  Then, on 12 February, gunmen shooting from a car executed Rivas and his son while they were riding a motorbike on the edge of their palm plantation.  “Now that they’ve killed my dad and brother, they’re threatening even more people,” Ibeth Rivas, Hipólito Rivas’ daughter, told The New Humanitarian outside their home in Panamá. “They’re going to kill more people.”  “It was very sad,” said a resident from a neighbouring town who attended the funeral and asked to remain anonymous. “There was a lot of grief in the family, the community, the farm workers organisation. They felt indignation, impotence, and completely defenceless before an armed group that had them surrounded.”  Rivas and his son were murdered in the Aguán Valley, in the coastal and agricultural department of Colón in northern Honduras. According to Insight Crime, the country had the highest homicide rate last year in Central America and the second highest in all of Latin America – second only to Venezuela.  “People are affected by a triple emergency – violence from drug corridors, droughts and the storms, and the pandemic.”  Since a military coup ousted president Manuel “Mel” Zelaya in 2009, Honduras has weathered several waves of violence linked to corruption, battles over land and resources, and drug trafficking. In 2013, the Honduran city of San Pedro Sula earned the unenviable rating of the world’s most violent place outside a declared war zone.  In the past year, the violence has escalated and expanded to new areas of the country, displacing more people and putting additional duress on an already strained humanitarian response.  “People are affected by a triple emergency – violence from drug corridors, droughts and the storms, and the pandemic,” said Maria José Alexander, emergency coordinator at the Catholic Relief Services aid agency. “We have to choose among the vulnerable, to choose the most vulnerable [to help].”  More and more Hondurans are heading north, hoping to reach safety in the United States. But those who flee – the Rivas family plans to join them – are often stranded on the US southern border, facing humanitarian challenges as President Joe Biden’s administration implements new policies to limit asylum claims.  Read more: How the US-Mexico border became an unrelenting humanitarian crisis  According to the UN’s refugee agency, UNHCR, an “unprecedented flow” of people transited through Honduras and left the country heading north in 2022. Hondurans represented the largest nationality requesting asylum in Mexico in 2022, and from January to September of last year more than 72,000 were deported from the United States and Mexico, according to Human Rights Watch.  Violence going rural  The violence in Honduras has historically been concentrated in urban areas, where gangs assert control, but these days an increasing number of killings are taking place in the countryside.  Colón has long been known for its conflicts over control of land and water between a drug-connected elite and local campesinos, or farm workers. According to statistics from the National Police Secretariat (SEPOL), it had the highest homicide rate in the country for 2022, with nearly 63 murders per 100,000 people, and at least 224 murders by the end of the year, versus 159 in 2020.  The murders have been attributed to expanding criminal networks, rising extortion rackets, and executions of suspected criminals at the hands of self-styled death squads.  Jared Olson/TNH Family members prepare a grave for the leader of a Colón cooperative opposing the seizing of palm plantations by agribusinesses. Omar Cruz, killed in January 2023 by unknown gunmen, is one of eight social leaders murdered since the end of last year.  Residents in Panamá, the small town four miles from Tocoa, Colón’s main urban centre, where the Rivas family lived, told The New Humanitarian the police are not investigating the murders of Rivas and his son.  This is not unusual, experts say. Honduran police are accused of manipulating the forms in which homicides are registered to create a false sense of security, as well as of failing to investigate the vast majority of murders, a 2020 article published in the NACLA Report on The Americas reported. A 2022 survey noted that seven out of ten Hondurans distrust the police.  Neither the public prosecutor’s office in the capital, Tegucigalpa, nor the local Tocoa police authorities responded to The New Humanitarian’s requests for comment.  ‘Surrounded by violence’  Experts attribute the recent carnage partly to the reshuffling of criminal networks in the wake of the July 2022 extradition of former president Juan Orlando Hernández to the United States on charges of drug and weapons trafficking, and since the election of ostensibly left-leaning president Xiomara Castro, who took office in January 2022.  “We know that the organised criminal structures that existed prior to January [2022] didn't just disappear,” said George Redmond, the Honduras director of the Irish aid organisation Trócaire,  “There has to be a new restructuring of relationships between the authorities and organised criminal groups like drug traffickers,” Redmond, who visited Colón last April, told The New Humanitarian.  A longtime resident of Colón and land rights activist, who spoke to The New Humanitarian anonymously, said there are now six paramilitary groups fighting for control and carrying out targeted killings in a region of the Aguán Valley known as the Margen Izquierda (Left Bank).  By late March, the frequent shootouts in the region had led to temporary closures of schools in Rigores, a town in Margen Izquierda. Across the country, children are increasingly deprived of proper schooling. According to the UN, 46% of displaced students suspended their education or couldn't return to class because of gang violence.  “You’ve got armed groups doing the rounds,” said Redmond, adding that groups like the one terrorising Panamá divide communities, buying off young men with the allure of drugs and guns, and sowing paranoia and distrust through killings and intimidation.  “You’re surrounded by violence from within and from without,” he said.  Abandoned by the government  Since the murder of Rivas and his son, their relatives have received no support from the government or outside organisations. They are now planning to leave – part of an ongoing crisis of internal displacement, triggered by multiple factors, including the rising violence, natural disasters, and economic stagnation. Authorities are at a loss for how to respond.  “While [Honduran authorities have] acknowledged that the country has a problem with internal displacement due to violence, neither the government nor the international NGOs who are present in the country are able to offer any real solutions to the internally displaced,” said Dr. Amelia Frank-Vitale, a postdoctoral research associate at Princeton University who has specialised on Honduras and migration.  Some 3.2 million people in Honduras are in need of assistance, many of them requiring protection and food, but only about 44% of the humanitarian needs in 2022 received funding.  “Families that NRC is assisting with relocation, support, and protection in Honduras told me how armed gangs used violence to take their land and property, and threatened to recruit their children. This forced them to flee their homes and ended their livelihoods and their children’s education,” Jan Egeland, the head of the Norwegian Refugee Council aid group, said in a statement after a visit last month.  “Women had survived horrific violence at home, including rape and other sexual violence. A woman was murdered every 28 hours last year in Honduras,” Egeland added. “Without increased attention and support for this crisis, nothing will change.”  In December, the “Law of Prevention, Attention to, and Protection of Internally Displaced People” was passed in the Honduran Congress, creating a legal framework for attending to internally displaced people. Implementation of the law is uncertain, and the Castro administration is facing other challenges.  “Neither the government nor the international NGOs who are present in the country are able to offer any real solutions to the internally displaced.”  After her election, Castro promised a “refounding” for the country. She said she would demilitarise the country’s security forces, which are linked to drug traffickers and gangs, including MS-13, one of the most dangerous in Central America.  But after a series of massacres last year, she agreed to keep the military police on the streets. She recently announced she would deploy other militarised police units to fight criminal groups and drug traffickers. Although her so-called “mano dura” (iron fist) crime policy remains popular, many Hondurans have grown frustrated over the lack of results.  “I think we were mistaken,” said Medarda Rivas, Hipólito’s sister. “I thought… [the Castro government] would help us as campesinos, but there isn’t a single thing they’ve done for us.”  Many residents in rural places like the Aguán Valley say they feel abandoned.  The Honduran government is supposed to protect people facing death threats through the National Protection Mechanism, which allows a person facing repeated deaths to call for police protection. But that programme failed Rivas, said Esmilda Rodas, one of his friends, and the widow of Juan Manual Moncada, another campesino who was murdered in Panamá in 2021.  “[My husband] would always call the police, to say ‘this is happening, you should be here,’” said Rodas. “They never came; the only times they did, they’d leave soon. They never protected them.”  Edited by Daniela Mohor and Tom Brady.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW5ld2h1bWFuaXRhcmlhbi5vcmcvbmV3cy1mZWF0dXJlLzIwMjMvMDUvMTgvdmlvbGVuY2UtSG9uZHVyYXMtZ2FuZ3MtaHVtYW5pdGFyaWFuLXJlc3BvbnNl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Dewberry said open flames, such as a cigarette lighter or a lit cigarette, are dangerous in an oxygen-rich environment.  “While oxygen isn’t flammable, a cigarette burns quicker and more intensely in a room containing supplemental oxygen, and can spark a catastrophic explosion,” Dewberry said.  “You should never smoke or run appliances with open flames in any room containing medical-grade oxygen.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovLzduZXdzLmNvbS5hdS9uZXdzL2ZpcmVzL294eWdlbi10YW5rLWV4cGxvc2lvbi1pbnZlc3RpZ2F0ZWQtYXMtcG9zc2libGUtY2F1c2Utb2YtYmVkcm9vbS1ibGF6ZS10aGF0LWxlZnQtd29tYW4taW4taG9zcGl0YWwtYy0xMDY5OTY3MNIBkAFodHRwczovLzduZXdzLmNvbS5hdS9uZXdzL2ZpcmVzL294eWdlbi10YW5rLWV4cGxvc2lvbi1pbnZlc3RpZ2F0ZWQtYXMtcG9zc2libGUtY2F1c2Utb2YtYmVkcm9vbS1ibGF6ZS10aGF0LWxlZnQtd29tYW4taW4taG9zcGl0YWwtYy0xMDY5OTY3MC5hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

REUTERS/Gleb... Read more                May 18 (Reuters) - Air raid alerts sounded throughout Ukraine early on Friday, with some areas later reporting explosions and officials saying anti-aircraft units were in action in several regions.  The alerts extended to all regions of the country for about an hour from 2 a.m. (2300 GMT).  But there were no reports of strikes on infrastructure or civilian targets and no indications of casualties as the alerts were withdrawn in Kyiv and in central and southern regions.  Air raid alerts remained in force into the early morning throughout western Ukraine, but only in two regions in the east and Russian-annexed Crimea in the south.  The head of Kyiv's military administration said Russian forces had sent successive waves of drones towards the capital, the 10th attack this month and the second in less than 24 hours.  ""This Kremlin tactic is an attempt to overwhelm our anti-aircraft forces and put psychological pressure on civilians. It won't happen!"" Serhiy Popko wrote on Telegram.  ""All air targets sent toward Kyiv were destroyed by our anti-aircraft defences.""  Several regions reported anti-aircraft units in operation.  Explosions were reported in widely separated regions, including Kriviy Rih in central Ukraine and Rivne and Lutsk in the west.  Ukraine's military had said on Telegram that Russian aircraft were in the air and there was a threat of strikes from hypersonic Kinzhal missiles. An earlier military statement said some airborne targets had been downed, but gave no details.  The military had warned that central regions and Kyiv were at risk from drones.  Russia's Tass news agency, quoting Russian-installed officials in the Moscow-controlled area of Donetsk region, said Ukrainian forces had fired eight grad missiles into the Russian-held city of Donetsk after midnight.  There were no details of damage or casualties.  Reuters was unable to verify details of any of the reported military activity.

"explosion","2023-05-19","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 00:25:24","Exploding cars may be entertaining to watch in action films. But cars erupting into fireballs when they crash or tumble down a mountainside is one of the most common and scientifically preposterous movie tropes.  With the release of Fast X, the latest in the Fast & Furious franchise, on May 19 2023, it’s time to debunk the myth of the exploding car.  Cars never explode under these circumstances and rarely catch fire. That’s unless you were unfortunate enough to be driving a Ford Pinto or Chevrolet Malibu in the 1970s. Both manufacturers cut corners in the production process and the result was poorly designed fuel tanks that were vulnerable to catching alight, often trapping the occupants inside.  Even when racing driver Romain Grosjean crashed at 140mph at the 2020 Bahrain Grand Prix, his vehicle caught fire but did not explode.  Petrol vapour is only explosive in air (which is 20% oxygen) and when under pressure. Liquid petrol isn’t explosive but the vapour can catch fire. Vapour can escape from the fuel tank when you unscrew the cap. But tanks have a system in which the pressure is relieved without venting the vapour. A full fuel tank is safer than you might think since there is no air inside it and so no oxygen.  In fact, liquid petrol can be difficult to ignite even when it comes into contact with a flame.  What an explosion needs  Explosions are normally caused by a reaction where one or more solids or liquids react and produce a corresponding amount of gas.  A gas occupies much more space (800 times the volume of liquid or solid) than the equivalent amount of solid or liquid. The force generated by the rapidly expanding gas creates the explosion.  Shrapnel is added to explosive weapons of war, which is propelled by the expanding gas.  Petrol doesn’t detonate on its own, but explodes with oxygen when it is in its gas form, is hot enough (about 257℃) and in the presence of a flame or spark.  Imagine watching someone on a hot day filling their car. Often you see a shimmering effect near the tank filler. This is petrol vapour. The “no smoking” instruction on petrol stations signage and painted on oil tankers is about eliminating one of the three requirements for petrol to catch fire.  Petrol is a high energy compound. These compounds release a lot of energy when they react with other substances. When petrol comes into contact with oxygen and burns, it produces low energy compounds (water and CO₂). The difference in energy between those compounds is seen and heard as sound, heat and light and expansive force.  In order for petrol to explode (rather than just burn) it needs to be under pressure, in the gas form, and have enough oxygen and a source of external energy such as a spark or flame to start the reaction.  Exploding cars  In a car engine, the explosion takes place in a cylinder. The piston compresses the air/petrol mixture to create the high-pressure conditions needed for an explosion. When a gas is compressed, it gets hot. That’s why the tip of a bicycle pump gets hot when you pump your tyres up. As the piston compresses the air/fuel mixture, the pressure and temperature rises.  The spark plug provides the small amount of energy required to make the reaction happen. This process happens several thousand times per minute in car engines.  Petrol and diesel can only explode when under pressure and mixed with air and in the case of petrol, have a small amount of energy added in the form of a spark or a flame. Engines pressurise the fuel/air mixture in the cylinder and so produce small, confined explosions which turn a crankshaft and drive the wheels.  Diesel is less flammable. Diesel engines use a higher boiling point fuel which spontaneously combusts under pressure, which is why diesel engines don’t need spark plugs. Diesel engines also cycle at a lower rate compared to petrol engines, which is why they last longer and offer greater fuel economy.  When cars are involved in collisions, fuel lines are often torn and petrol leaks out onto a hot engine. Liquid petrol can catch fire in the presence of air. But it can’t explode because it’s not under pressure and is in the liquid phase rather than a vapour.  In a car crash, diesel or petrol may occasionally catch fire, but there is no mechanism for creating the high pressures required for them to explode, so they don’t.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlY29udmVyc2F0aW9uLmNvbS9mYXN0LXgtd2h5LWNhcnMtZG9udC1yZWFsbHktZXhwbG9kZS13aGVuLXRoZXktY3Jhc2gtMjA1MDY40gFaaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVjb252ZXJzYXRpb24uY29tL2FtcC9mYXN0LXgtd2h5LWNhcnMtZG9udC1yZWFsbHktZXhwbG9kZS13aGVuLXRoZXktY3Jhc2gtMjA1MDY4?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

For workers manufacturing plastic resin, the high heat used in the production process increases the risks.  Despite the dangers, inspectors with the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration found Sumitomo Bakelite North American Inc. — operating as Durez Corp. in Kenton — has again failed to follow required safety measures to protect workers from the dangers of chemical exposure and potential explosion. OSHA identified similar violations in a 2019 inspection.  In response to a complaint, OSHA opened an investigation in December 2022 and found the company did not prevent resin accumulations from exposing control room workers to respiratory and fire hazards.  ""Durez Corp. knowingly failed to develop and implement safeguards to protect employees from toxic gas releases, explosions from process equipment, and use good housekeeping procedures to protect its employees from potential combustible resin fires,"" explained OSHA Area Director Todd Jensen in Toledo, Ohio. ""This company must make safety as important as profit before employees are sickened or tragedy occurs.""  The agency cited Durez Corp. for one willful violation for its failure to ensure the HVAC system effectively maintained a positive pressure on the control room and automatically shut off in the event of a formaldehyde release and to ensure employees working in the control room would not be injured in the event of a reaction vessel explosion. The company also received one serious citation for lacking an effective housekeeping program to minimize the amount of combustible resin on surfaces throughout the facility.

"explosion","2023-05-18","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 13:52:03","By Keith Loria | May 18, 2023  ADVERTISEMENT  Improvements and innovations in fire and explosion protection have come at a steady pace in recent years, as more companies are investing in products to make things safer and easier while complying with regulations. Pellet Mill Magazine spoke with five industry experts about the latest trends, innovative products and what they believe should be future priorities. Interviewees include: Jeramy Slaunwhite, chief technical officer, explosion safety for Rembe Inc.; David Grandaw, vice president of sales for IEP Technologies; Allen Wagoner, president of FLAMEX Inc.; Jason Krbec, sales engineering manager for CV Technology Inc.; and Eric Peterson, CEO of Fagus GreCon Inc.    PMM: What do you think has been the most significant innovation in fire and explosion protection in recent years?    Slaunwhite: Holistically, the higher awareness and regard for dust explosion hazards and mitigation strategies in industrial processing facilities have greatly improved. Considering combustible dust fires and explosions have been occurring for as long as dusts and powders have been handled, the development and refinement of flame-arresting technology over the past few decades has provided feasible explosion protection solutions for many facilities and industries. Flameless venting allows for reliable explosion protection without harmful fireballs and pressures inside buildings and occupied areas.    Krbec: The most significant innovation is the more cost-effective and advanced design isolation systems, specifically explosion isolation systems for the inlet lines to dust collectors and also the clean air exhaust return lines from dust collectors. We’ve seen more reliable solutions developed, as well as some really improved testing standards for those type of products. It’s been a point of emphasis, because it’s where we see one of the largest gaps in the process industry.    Grandaw: The electromechanical suppressor used for active explosion suppression and isolation systems. For many decades, all styles of high-rate discharge extinguishers used for explosion suppression or isolation systems used some version of pyrotechnical device to activate, such as electro-explosive actuators or gas cartridge actuators. Besides the safe handling considerations necessary for these types of devices, there were often challenges with shipping, as some of these devices required special licensing. In addition, most of the pyrotechnical actuating devices required periodic changeout to ensure proper operation of the extinguisher.    Peterson: As everything gets a little more technically advanced, having things become more intelligent and smarter on their own—as we struggle with labor and a lot of different parts and pieces—is important. The interconnectedness and equipment that delivers things just a little bit easier is very helpful. It’s still new in the fire and explosion side of things.    Wagoner: It’s a broad area, and encompasses a lot. A number of processes employed in the manufacturing of wood pellets present a fire and explosion hazard that must be addressed to ensure workplace safety, protection of assets and avoidance of downtime. Drying and hammer milling of wood material are particularly conducive to the generation of sparks and fire within the pneumatic transport system. Other processes such as pelletizing, pellet cooling, screening and product load out are also subject to possible ignition from sparks, overheated pellets and mechanical friction sources. To combat the all too common problem of dust collector fires and explosions in woodworking industry, we pioneered the use of a new technology in North America by introducing the FLAMEX Spark Detection and Extinguishing System in 1977. Since that time, thousands of have been installed in a variety of industrial facilities across North America, including many medium and large industrial wood pellet operations.    PMM: What product or service designed for this space is your company the proudest of?    Krbec: We developed a completely passive isolation device for clean air exhaust for dust collectors, and one that uses the same technology as our flameless vents—to have an isolation point that doesn’t require any moving components. We call it the Interceptor–QV and developed it a few years back, and we have had a lot of success with it in various industries—not just biomass. It’s won a couple of design awards for safety products.    Grandaw: From a product standpoint, it would be our SmartDS detection system. Most explosion suppression or isolation systems use pressure-activated explosion detectors to initiate explosion control. This is a detection method well proven for many decades. With the SmartDS system, we use a rate-of-pressure rise detection technology that is programmed to respond to explosive rates of pressure rise, thus minimizing false actuations due to process pressure issues. The system has a history buffer that provides graphical evidence of the pressure increases just prior to and during any event leading to a system discharge. This is a great investigation tool for determining that an incipient explosion has been suppressed, resulting in the post-event investigation focusing on corrective action to address the ignition source.    Slaunwhite: At REMBE, one of our major shining achievements is the development of flameless venting technology for dust explosion venting, several decades ago with the Q-Rohr. This has led to our Q-Box flame arrestor and particulate retention device, a flameless explosion vent. The Q-Box is a versatile, economical and third-party tested and certified solution for safe indoor explosion protection in many industries, including food and wood processing.    Peterson: One is a spark detector that has been on the market for about a year and a half. It can basically adapt whether there’s light or not, and actually gets smart and adjusts to the light over time. So, if there’s a hole in the duct work or a flap that opens up, historically, the sensor would just fire off. This one will get smart and realize there’s a certain amount of light, and adjust to it. That type of detection obviously has a lot of benefits for anyone who has extraneous light. The other is GreCon IEM, an intelligent extinguishment system that we just came out with this year. It will monitor the wear of the nozzle and it will also monitor the flow. It helps with proactive maintenance.    Wagoner: Our extinguishing turbine, the MXOne Firefighting Turbine, represents a new generation of stationary firefighting. The system has a 360-degree operating range and allows the application of water mist from a long, safe distance and with high accuracy. When extinguishing a fire with water mist, the water is atomized under high pressure, producing a dramatic increase of water surface which allows a greater efficiency in the absorption of heat. When water evaporates, its volume is increased many times over, which causes a cooling and suffocating effect on the fire. The volume of water consumed during the firefighting effort, as well as the consequential damage caused by the water, are extremely low. The control and direction of the extinguishing turbine can be done fully automatically upon detection by IR Flame Detectors, remotely by mobile devices or manually. Various stationary and mobile control variants can be implemented according to the operator's requirements.    PMM: What aspect of fire and explosion protection could use improvement?    Slaunwhite: In my opinion and observations, the most widespread shortfall regarding combustible dust explosion safety is the do-it-yourself approach to protection equipment with a “good enough” mentality. There are recognized standards for design, performance testing, application and reliability of explosion safety equipment that ensure the equipment will do its job if called upon. The nature of dust explosions is highly chaotic. As such, these standards use testing and calculations based on actual explosion testing to ensure reliable protection. In a high quantity of site inspections, especially in the wood industry, I have observed uncertified and undocumented explosion relief vents and isolation devices, often with visible deterioration. Unlike other fire safety system such as sprinklers, which must be designed and certified by an engineer with listed and approved components without question, dust explosion protection is too often under-designed with no accountability, using questionable equipment. The awareness and standards have certainly been evolving over the past few decades, as has much of industrial technology.    Grandaw: Regular periodic inspections of fire and explosion protection systems. While it is true that these systems are designed for use in the challenging conditions found in industrial plants, if these protection systems are compromised due to lack of proper maintenance, process equipment damage, injury to personnel or worse can happen. Fire and explosion protection systems are like other process-related equipment, needing periodic inspections, and sometimes component replacement when compromised.    Krbec: One of the major things that need to be improved is some of the training and awareness of protection systems themselves. A lot of that goes to the plant operations side. Much of the explosion and fire protection systems are not completely hands-off; they do require some understanding of how to operate and use them properly if you’re doing certain types of process activity. That communication and training is still one of the big gaps we see.    Peterson: One of the big challenges is that most everything in today’s systems and facilities is all wired. There isn't a lot of wireless. Being able to move into some sort of cloud environment where we can go into a lot of different places and not have everything connected back to a system would certainly be extremely beneficial from a time, cost and maintenance perspective. Anything we can do to start connecting these pieces would be big plus.    Wagoner: Owners or operators of a facility where materials determined to be combustible or explosible are present in an enclosure are responsible for obtaining a dust hazard analysis (DHA) in accordance with NFPA 652, Chapter 7. A DHA is a written document that is prepared by a qualified individual to identify specific hazards in the facility, and to provide prescriptive measures to be taken to address those identified hazards. The DHA is to be reviewed and updated every five years. Many facility owners are unaware of this requirement or have failed to take steps to have one conducted. It is widely believed that this is the first step in addressing the dangers of potential fires and explosions that are largely inherent in facilities that handle combustible dusts.

"explosion","2009-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Knoxville"", ""Tennessee"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 16:56:00","Over 33 million individuals in the United States are currently driving vehicles equipped with airbag inflators that pose a potential fatality risk. These inflators have the rare possibility of exploding during a collision a releasing dangerous shrapnel.  And only a tiny fraction of drivers know it.  And because of a dispute between federal safety regulators and an airbag parts manufacturer, they aren't likely to find out anytime soon.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is demanding that the manufacturer, ARC Automotive of Knoxville, Tennessee, recall 67 million inflators that could explode with such force as to blow apart a metal canister and expel shrapnel. But ARC is refusing to do so, setting up a possible court fight with the agency.  NHTSA argues that the recall is justified because two people have been killed in the United States and Canada and at least seven others have been injured by ARC's inflators. The explosions, which first occurred in 2009, have continued as recently as this year.  After an investigation that lasted for eight years, NHTSA tentatively concluded that the inflators are defective. The agency's documents show that the inflators date from at least the 2002 model year to January 2018, when ARC installed equipment on its manufacturing lines that could detect potential safety problems.  One of those who died was Marlene Beaudoin, a 40-year-old mother of 10 from Michigan's Upper Peninsula who was struck by metal fragments when her 2015 Chevrolet Traverse SUV was involved in a minor crash in 2021. She and four of her sons had been on their way to get ice cream. The sons were not hurt.  ARC maintains that no safety defect exists, that NHTSA's demand is based on a hypothesis rather than technical conclusions and that the agency has no authority to order a parts manufacturer to carry out recalls, which ARC contends are the responsibility of automakers.  In a letter to NHTSA, ARC said no automaker had found a defect common to all 67 million inflators, and no root cause has been identified in the inflator ruptures.  ""ARC believes they resulted from random 'one-off' manufacturing anomalies that were properly addressed by vehicle manufacturers through lot-specific recalls,"" the letter said.  In a statement, NHTSA indicated that both ARC and automakers are responsible for recalls and that it can seek a recall from a parts maker that supplies multiple automakers.  The next step is for NHTSA to issue a final ruling on whether the inflators are defective, then hold a public hearing. It potentially could take ARC to court to seek a recall order. NHTSA would not say when or whether any of this will happen.  In the meantime, owners of vehicles made by at least a dozen automakers – Chevrolet, Buick, GMC, Ford, Toyota, Stellantis, Volkswagen, Audi, BMW, Porsche, Hyundai and Kia – are left to wonder anxiously whether their vehicles contain driver or front passenger inflators made by ARC. (Some vehicles have ARC inflators on both sides.)  Because ARC supplies inflators that are included in other manufacturers' airbags, there's no easy way for vehicle owners to determine whether their inflators are made by ARC. Neither NHTSA nor ARC nor the automakers have released a full list of affected models.  The standoff with ARC has sent automakers struggling to find out just how many of their vehicles contain the inflators. The auto manufacturers are also asking NHTSA whether they must start doing recalls. Automakers know many of the models affected. But many say they're still gathering information from later model years to determine which vehicles contain the affected inflators.  ""We are still investigating,"" said Maria Buczkowski, a spokesperson for Ford. ""We have not had any ARC airbag inflators rupture in the field.""  James Bell, a Kia spokesperson, said, ""We do not have a final count on vehicles that were built with ARC inflators, but the team is collecting the data.""  Toyota confirmed that some of its vehicles have ARC inflators but wouldn't comment further.  Other automakers said they were trying to find a cause and were working with the government or didn't respond to requests for information.  NHTSA contends that byproducts from welding during manufacturing can clog a vent inside the inflator canister that's designed to let gas escape to fill airbags quickly in a crash. Pressure can build to the point where the canister is blown apart.  Michael Brooks, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety, called on NHTSA and the automakers to release a list of affected models.  ""Customers, I think, have a right to know if there's a potential defect in their car, particularly if it's sitting a few inches from their chest and can explode,"" Brooks said.  The situation, he said, is reminiscent of the early stages of the Takata airbag inflator recalls in 2001. It took years for all the affected vehicle models to be announced.  Both ARC and Takata used ammonium nitrate to inflate airbags. Takata's situation was more dangerous, Brooks said, because, in its inflators, the chemical could deteriorate over time when exposed to high heat and humidity. Unlike Takata, ARC uses ammonium nitrate only as a secondary chemical to inflate airbags. ARC's problem appears to derive instead from a manufacturing defect.  From 2017 to 2022, the ARC problems triggered seven small recalls from automakers. On Friday, the same day NHTSA announced its action against ARC, General Motors announced the recall of nearly 1 million more.  The company said it's recalling certain 2014 through 2017 GMC Acadia, Chevy Traverse and Buick Enclave SUVs because the ARC inflators can explode. The recall came after GM was told this year that the driver'sairbagg ruptured in a 2017 Traverse. GM, which says it doesn't know what caused the inflator to explode, has hired an engineering firm to help investigate.

"explosion","1683-05-20","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 18:00:43","This image of the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A, the first object observed by NASA’s Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) satellite, combines two sets of telescope data. X-ray data from IXPE is in magenta and higher-energy X-rays from NASA's Chandra X-Ray Observatory are in blue.  An unexpected effect sighted in supernova wreckage may be caused by a highly magnetized neutron star, or magnetar, and quantum activity never seen before.  Like all neutron stars, magnetars form when massive stars end their lives in a collapse that also triggers a massive supernova explosion. The matter that composes neutron stars is so dense that a sugar cube of it would weigh over a billion tons on Earth. The magnetic fields around these star remnants are the most powerful in the known universe, often 100 trillion times stronger than that of our planet.  As such neutron stars and magnetars represent the most extreme celestial objects, the investigation of them is vital to better understanding the universe. The new study, published April 18 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (opens in new tab), examines the remnants surrounding the supernova leftovers of Cassiopeia A. The explosion was visible to Earth 340 years ago.  Related: Why magnetars should freak you out  Astronomers have always suspected that magnetars would generate highly polarized X-rays around them, meaning that the electromagnetic field of the magnetars' radiation vibrates in a preferred direction.  But, scientists were surprised in 2022 when data collected by NASA's Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) satellite, which launched the year before, showed polarization may depend on energy. IXPE information suggested that may be the case after looking at X-rays in the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A around the magnetar 4U 0142+61, located 13,000 light-years away.  As the first-ever measurement of the polarization of X-rays around a magnetar, the IXPE observations showed that lower energy X-rays were polarized at 180 degrees to the high-energy X-rays. Both energetic ray sets were oriented at 90 degrees to the electromagnetic field of the magnetar.  ""Photon metamorphosis,"" meaning the transformation of X-ray photons into electrons and positrons, may be able to explain the weird behavior of X-rays around magnetars, Cornell University astrophysics professor Dong Lai said in a May 4 statement (opens in new tab). ""Photon metamorphosis"" is an element of quantum electrodynamics (QED) , which is a field of physics examining subatomic interactions between electrons and photons.  ""In this observation of radiation from a faraway celestial object, we see a beautiful effect that is a manifestation of intricate, fundamental physics,"" Lai said. ""QED is one of the most successful physics theories, but it had not been tested in such strong magnetic field conditions.""  Related: Bizarre object 10 million times brighter than the sun defies physics, NASA says  Cassiopeia A is a supernova remnant located about 11,000 light-years from Earth in the constellation Cassiopeia. It spans approximately 10 light-years. This image uses data from the James Webb Space Telescope's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) to reveal the remnant in a new light. (Image credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, D. D. Milisavljevic (Purdue), T. Temim (Princeton), I. De Looze (Ghent University). Image Processing: J. DePasquale (STScI).)  (opens in new tab)  QED predicts that as X-ray photons leave the tenuous atmosphere of a neutron star's surrounding plasma — hot and magnetized gas — the photons pass through a phase called vacuum resonance.  Lai said that in this phase, photons that have no electric charge could convert into a virtual pair of particles (an electron and a positron) that have equal and opposite charges but still combine to a net zero charge. Because they have a charge, however, these particles are influenced by the magnetar's powerful magnetic field. The polarity could therefore cause high-energy X-rays to swing 90 degrees relative to low-energy X-rays.  ""You can think about the polarization as two flavors of photons,"" Lai continued. ""A photon suddenly converting from one flavor to another — you don't usually see this kind of thing. But it's a natural consequence of the physics, if you apply the theory under these extreme conditions.""  An artist's impression of a magnetar. (Image credit: ESO/L. Calçada)  (opens in new tab)  When IXPE examined another magnetar called 1RXS J170849.0–400910, with an even more powerful magnetic field, the same ""swing"" in the polarization of low and high energy X-rays was not spotted. Lai said that his calculations can account for this; they suggest vacuum resonance and photon metamorphosis would occur very deep inside such a neutron star.  As well as potentially explaining the strange polarization of X-rays seen around 4U 0142+61, Lai said that his interpretation of IXPE data helps constrain the strength of its magnetic field and the rate at which it rotates. The findings also suggest that the atmosphere of this magnetar is composed in part of ionized heavy elements.  Lai said the study of neutron stars helps scientists better understand the physics of matter in conditions that couldn't ever be simulated ever on Earth, meaning it adds to our understanding of the universe's beauty and diversity.  ""The observations by IXPE have opened a new window for studying the surface environment of neutron stars,"" Lai said. ""This will lead to new insights into these enigmatic objects.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwYWNlLmNvbS9jYXNzaW9wZWlhLWEtc3VwZXJub3ZhLXJlbW5hbnQtbWFnbmV0YXItbmV1dHJvbi1zdGFy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Elon Musk-led company has requested a six-month window from June 15 to December 15 to launch a Starship prototype to Earth’s orbit from the company’s Starbase facility in Boca Chica, Texas, according to the application. The FCC regulates all spacecraft communication in Earth’s orbit. SpaceX hasn’t said whether Starship’s second orbital launch attempt will carry any payload, but said in Monday’s application an FCC “special temporary authority” is necessary for the mission. Before going interplanetary, Starship will first be used as a regular launch vehicle to send SpaceX’s Starlink satellites and other payloads to Earth’s orbit. To actually launch, SpaceX will also need permission from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which issues rocket launch licenses.  Starship’s first orbital test exploded  SpaceX attempted the first orbital launch of Starship on April 20 from Boca Chica. A nearly 400-foot-tall rocket prototype, comprised of an upper stage called SN20 and a Super Heavy booster, lifted off successfully and soared to about 20 miles in the sky before blowing up. The explosion damaged the rocket’s launch pad and scattered debris and dust for miles from the launch site.  The result wasn’t a complete surprise. Musk said before the launch there was only a 50 percent chance of Starship reaching orbit on the first attempt. He considered the test a success and tweeted that the SpaceX team “learned a lot for [the] next test launch in a few months.”  FAA is conducting a “mishap investigation” into Starship’s first test launch.

Officers arrested L'Donpatrick Bones, 42, in a room at the Days Inn at 901 Fair Park Ave. around 9:50 p.m., about three hours after they discovered the explosive components during a traffic stop near 5322 Asher Ave.  Police said they identified Bones as the possible owner of the components after interviewing the two people in the vehicle during the stop, Barry Poindexter, 45, and Brittany Brown, 29. Officers pulled over Poindexter because he was observed speeding, and he told them he did not have a valid license, police said.  A search of the vehicle located containers of a crystalline substance and a bag containing a yellow cord connected to a silver object that the officers recognized as a blasting cap, police said. Police cleared the area while Little Rock Fire Department bomb squad technicians examined the items.  The technicians identified the substance as ammonium nitrate and nitro methane connected to a commercial-grade blasting cap and declared the scene safe.  Ammonium nitrate is a component in explosives used in mining and construction. Nitro methane is also explosive and is also a component in the fuel used by drag racing cars. Blasting caps serve as ignition sources for larger explosive charges.

"explosion","2023-01-01","Not Discerned","{""NewYork"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 17:57:00","New York, NY  --News Direct--  The world of cryptocurrency continues to exhilarate investors - with predictive insights becoming more valuable than ever as these investors seek market-beating returns.  OpenAI's powerful language model, ChatGPT, has become a widely-used tool in this regard, shedding light on potential high performers in the crypto landscape.  In this article, we'll explore five promising cryptocurrencies that, per ChatGPT's analysis, are poised for explosive growth this year.  1. AiDoge ($AI)  The first crypto that ChatGPT is heavily bullish on is AiDoge ($AI) – an AI-powered meme generation platform built on the Ethereum blockchain.  AiDoge's compelling use cases have attracted investor attention, meaning the project has now raised over $8.6 million in funding through its ongoing presale.  Investors are excited by the potential applications for AiDoge's meme generator, which looks to streamline the process of creating hilarious images for social media platforms like Twitter and Reddit.  Additionally, AiDoge's earnings protocol rewards meme creators with $AI, the platform's native ERC-20 token, for generating images that resonate with the wider community.  The combination of these features has piqued the interest of crypto-savvy investors – but what does ChatGPT think?  Per ChatGPT's analysis, the $AI token's value could rise to $0.00336 by the end of 2023 – representing a 100x return for those who invest at the intended exchange listing price of $0.0000336.  This bullish forecast will be great news for early AiDoge.com investors. Fortunately for those not yet involved, AiDoge's presale is still ongoing – with $AI tokens currently priced at $0.0000308.  Visit AiDoge Presale  2. yPredict ($YPRED)  Another project that's making waves in the crypto market is yPredict ($YPRED) . This Polygon-based ecosystem looks to revolutionize digital asset investors' research and analysis process by providing a comprehensive suite of advanced tools and features.  The yPredict ecosystem boasts features such as automatic pattern recognition, advanced technical indicators, AI-powered price forecasts, and investor sentiment analysis.  On top of all that, yPredict's platform will also have a predictive model marketplace, where AI specialists can market their creations, allowing retail investors to access them for a monthly or annual fee.  This fee will be paid in $YPRED – yPredict's native ERC-20 token. Although transactions will be $YPRED's primary use case, token holders can also stake their holdings and generate regular rewards.  Like with AiDoge, ChatGPT appears optimistic about yPredict's prospects. As noted by ChatGPT, positive fundamentals and a bullish crypto market could help the $YPRED price increase post-launch.  As such, ChatGPT estimates that $YPRED could hit $1.20 by the end of 2023 – which would be a 900% increase from the expected listing price.  However, ChatGPT also highlights the looming threat of regulatory change – a factor that could hamper the progress of many new crypto projects, including yPredict.  Visit yPredict Presale  3. Ecoterra ($ECOTERRA)  Ecoterra ($ECOTERRA) is an eco-friendly crypto project that seeks to reward individuals and businesses for being more sustainable.  The project's flagship feature is its ""Recycle2Earn"" app, which provides tokenized rewards every time a user recycles glass, plastic, cardboard, and other materials. These rewards are distributed in $ECOTERRA – the project's native token.  Alongside this Recycle2Earn app, the Ecoterra ecosystem will also have a carbon offset marketplace where individuals and businesses can buy offsets to reduce their carbon footprint.  Ecoterra goes beyond just tokenized rewards for recycling; it will also host a marketplace for recycled materials. This marketplace will enable businesses to conveniently acquire used resources, offering payment options in $ECOTERRA and other prominent cryptocurrencies.  Given the pressing threat of global warming, the need for sustainability-focused crypto projects like Ecoterra is higher than ever.  This could contribute to the demand for $ECOTERRA tokens once the project's presale ends – with ChatGPT forecasting that the token's value could soar as high as $0.50 by the end of 2023.  Considering prospective investors can buy $ECOTERRA tokens for $0.00775 during Stage 6 of the presale phase, this presents a unique opportunity for a substantial return on investment, should ChatGPT's forecast prove accurate.  Visit Ecoterra Presale  4. Polygon ($MATIC)  Polygon ($MATIC) is a blockchain platform that aims to create a multi-chain system that can be integrated with the Ethereum network.  The Polygon platform is fast, secure, and scalable – making it an appealing option for the developers of large decentralized applications (dApps).  Moreover, Polygon uses a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which is significantly more energy-efficient than the proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism used by chains like Bitcoin and Dogecoin.  Although the price of $MATIC, Polygon's native token, has fallen substantially since late February, ChatGPT remains optimistic about its prospects.  According to ChatGPT, the $MATIC price could return to $1.70 by the end of 2023 – a level that hasn't been seen since March 2022.  For this to occur, ChatGPT states that Polygon would need to continue its mission of scaling Ethereum transactions and growing the number of dApps that utilize the network.  5. Kaspa ($KAS)  Last but not least is Kaspa ($KAS). Kaspa is a PoW cryptocurrency that uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) protocol, meaning blocks can be created in parallel, providing scope for super-quick transaction speeds.  Through this system, Kaspa aims to be a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) payment system that can outmatch Bitcoin in terms of scalability.  Moreover, the Kaspa project is entirely open-source, and the mainnet was launched with no pre-mining – meaning that no single entity has control over the $KAS token supply.  This has undoubtedly contributed to ChatGPT's positivity around the project. Per ChatGPT, the $KAS price could reverse its current downtrend and reach $0.475 by the end of the year – a price increase of 150%.  However, as with all of ChatGPT's predictions, the chatbot does urge caution – as factors like market conditions, adoption rates, and roadmap delays could impact any bullish price forecast.

"explosion","2005-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Pasadena"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 19:07:30","A fire at a Marathon Petroleum refinery near Houston caused visible flames and left at least one worker dead, the company said.  Marathon said the cause of the Monday morning fire was under investigation. Aerial footage from Houston television stations showed crews trying to put out flames at the Galveston Bay refinery, which is along a stretch of Texas coast that is heavily populated by petrochemical facilities.  Neither the company nor authorities immediately said whether anyone else was injured.  “The safety of our workers and the community is our top priority, and a full investigation will be conducted to determine the cause of the incident,” Marathon said in a statement.  Fires at refineries in the area are not uncommon. Earlier this month, a fire at a Shell facility in nearby Deer Park sent nine workers to the hospital and caused massive plumes of smoke.  In March, an explosion and fire at a facility owned by INEOS Phenol in nearby Pasadena, Texas, left one injured.  The fire comes after a 2005 explosion – one of the worst refinery explosions in U.S. history – left 15 dead and 180 others injured at this same facility, which was then owned by BP. It was sold to Marathon in 2013, renamed the Galveston Bay refinery and in 2018 merged with another Marathon facility to become what it is today, according to previous statements by BP and Marathon.

"explosion","2017-12-05","Not Discerned","{""Chicago"", ""Illinois"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 02:01:34","Artificial intelligence could be a useful tool in mental health treatment, according to the results of a new pilot study led by University of Illinois Chicago researchers.  The study, which was the first to test an AI voice-based virtual coach for behavioral therapy, found changes in patients’ brain activity along with improved depression and anxiety symptoms after using Lumen, an AI voice assistant that delivered a form of psychotherapy.  The UIC team says the results, which are published in the journal Translational Psychiatry, offer encouraging evidence that virtual therapy can play a role in filling the gaps in mental health care, where waitlists and disparities in access are often hurdles that patients, particularly from vulnerable communities, must overcome to receive treatment.  “We’ve had an incredible explosion of need, especially in the wake of COVID, with soaring rates of anxiety and depression and not enough practitioners,” said Dr. Olusola A. Ajilore, UIC professor of psychiatry and co-first author of the paper. “This kind of technology may serve as a bridge. It’s not meant to be a replacement for traditional therapy, but it may be an important stop-gap before somebody can seek treatment.”  Lumen, which operates as a skill in the Amazon Alexa application, was developed by Ajilore and study senior author Dr. Jun Ma, the Beth and George Vitoux Professor of Medicine at UIC, along with collaborators at Washington University in St. Louis and Pennsylvania State University, with the support of a $2 million grant from the National Institute of Mental Health.  The UIC researchers recruited over 60 patients for the clinical study exploring the application’s effect on mild-to-moderate depression and anxiety symptoms, and activity in brain areas previously shown to be associated with the benefits of problem-solving therapy.  Two-thirds of the patients used Lumen on a study-provided iPad for eight problem-solving therapy sessions, with the rest serving as a “waitlist” control receiving no intervention.  After the intervention, study participants using the Lumen app showed decreased scores for depression, anxiety and psychological distress compared with the control group. The Lumen group also showed improvements in problem-solving skills that correlated with increased activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a brain area associated with cognitive control. Promising results for women and underrepresented populations also were found.  “It’s about changing the way people think about problems and how to address them, and not being emotionally overwhelmed,” Ma said. “It’s a pragmatic and patient-driven behavior therapy that’s well established, which makes it a good fit for delivery using voice-based technology.”  A larger trial comparing the use of Lumen with both a control group on a waitlist, and patients receiving human-coached problem-solving therapy is currently being conducted by the researcher. They stress that the virtual coach doesn’t need to perform better than a human therapist to fill a desperate need in the mental health system.  “The way we should think about digital mental health service is not for these apps to replace humans, but rather to recognize what a gap we have between supply and demand, and then find novel, effective and safe ways to deliver treatments to individuals who otherwise do not have access, to fill that gap,” Ma said.  Co-first author of the study is Thomas Kannampallil at Washington University in St. Louis.  Other co-investigators include Aifeng Zhang, Nan Lv, Nancy E. Wittels, Corina R. Ronneberg, Vikas Kumar, Susanth Dosala, Amruta Barve, Kevin C. Tan, Kevin K. Cao, Charmi R. Patel and Emily A. Kringle, all of UIC; Joshua Smyth and Jillian A.

"explosion","2023-05-17","Not Discerned","{""Oakland"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 21:18:05","Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher Zac Gallen's pre-game warmup routine took a bizarre turn on Wednesday, as he hit a passing bird while throwing a curveball during warmups for a road game against the Oakland Athletics. The bird did not survive.  The unusual incident - and unfortunate one for lovers of ornithology -- was strangely familiar to the Diamondbacks, as it immediately invoked memories of one of the team's -- and MLB's -- most bizarre pitching highlights. During a spring training game in 2001, Diamondbacks Hall of Fame pitcher Randy Johnson famously hit a bird while on the mound, obliterating the bird in an explosion of feathers.  The incident with Gallen's bird was much less dramatic, as the bird would only fall to the ground as his pitch was redirected.  The incident with Gallen was the latest in a select few examples of the ballpark being a perilous place for birds. In 1985, for instance, New York Yankees star Dave Winfield hit and killed a seagull while warming up in the middle of the fifth inning.  Gallen enters Wednesday's game having had a strong season so far, with a 2.35 ERA, 6-1 record, 0.855 WHIP and 70 strikeouts in 57 1/3 innings across nine starts.Gallen's WHIP mark is currently the best in the National League.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNzcG9ydHMuY29tL21sYi9uZXdzL2RpYW1vbmRiYWNrcy1waXRjaGVyLXphYy1nYWxsZW4taGl0cy1iaXJkLWR1cmluZy13YXJtdXBzLXN0aXJyaW5nLXVwLW1lbW9yaWVzLW9mLXJhbmR5LWpvaG5zb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"explosion","2023-09-01","22:00:00","{""Brooklyn"", ""Ohio"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 14:09:18","Today, with the release of their latest single ""Stumbling Still,"" Nation of Language have shared an explosive new preview of the frenetic energy and intense array of feelings that make up their forthcoming album, Strange Disciple. Out September 15th on [PIAS], and recently named one of the most anticipated albums of summer by Pitchfork, the ten-song collection is connected through themes of hopeless devotion, infatuation and overwhelming obsession, presented as the ideal soundtrack for long walks through city streets. Whereas lead singer and songwriter Ian Devaney imagines the band's 2020 debut, Introduction, Presence, as taking place in a car – and second album A Way Forward occurring on and as a locomotive – Strange Disciple is, at last, ambulatory and wayfaring, informed by the excitement of exploring new places the Brooklyn trio never thought they would see or play during their remarkable pandemic-era breakout. Clamoring with a propulsive kraut-punk groove and bouncing bassline, ""Stumbling Still"" encapsulates that form of forward motion, with lyrics that deliver an equally restless but far less healthy series of incessant thoughts and internal strife. Listen to ""Stumbling Still"" Here Premiered via KCRW, ""Stumbling Still"" arrives on the heels of the soaring ""Sole Obsession,"" which ""cloaks its emotional vulnerability in an avalanche of synthesizer and a rapid tempo"" (Billboard), as well as album opener ""Weak In Your Light,"" hailed as both an ""excellent exploration of passion and agony"" and a ""subdued re-introduction to the best synth-pop band in the world"" (Paste). Through Devaney's towering vocal performance, he fluctuates between fixation and shame, bringing the listener down a turbulent path of self-exploration and showing that one should not shy away from the brief pain necessary to make a much-needed change. Like the rest of Strange Disciple, ""Stumbling Still"" was produced by Nick Millhiser (Holy Ghost!, LCD Soundsystem), and recorded in his East Williamsburg studio, as it sees Nation of Language considering the creative choices that would be most compelling to perform on-stage, for the first time. Incorporating more live drums, guitar and shoegaze influences into their arrangements than ever before, the band expand their new wave, post-punk and synth-powered sound with newfound fervor. Ahead of Pitchfork Festival, Primavera Sound, Outside Lands and nearly 60 more US, UK and EU performances that Nation of Language have already announced for 2023, the band are just beginning to debut music from Strange Disciple live. Earlier this month, during an unforgettable night documented by Rolling Stone, they headlined their largest hometown show to date at Brooklyn Steel. As Consequence praised, ""Nation of Language put star power on display...each entrancing track was perfectly executed, and now they've got us hungry for more."" Tonight the band headlines LA's Fonda Theatre, before two sold-out stops in Seattle this week, each with support from Reggie Watts.

A State Fire Marshal report of the April 10 fire at the Southfork Dairy Farm about 50 miles (80 kilometers) southwest of Amarillo did not determine what caused the engine fire, but found there was “no intentional act to cause a failure.” The April 24 report said the investigation was closed.  A worker driving the truck through a section of the 2 million-square-foot barn told investigators he noticed what he first thought was steam coming from the engine compartment. He tried to drive out of the barn when he realized it was a fire, but couldn’t make it.  The driver said he tried to put out the fire with two extinguishers but failed. Several other employees told investigators they rushed to help, but the fire quickly spread.  The report noted the dairy farm had a second manure hauling truck on the property outside of the barn. A dairy manager told investigators it too had previously burned. The report noted burn marks near the engine compartment consistent with the truck fire inside the barn.

"explosion","2023-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 13:01:09","There was another huge week on the crypto market as meme coins HOMER and SAUDI PEPE explode. Continuing the trend that started earlier this year, more and more meme coins are pumping and wreaking havoc on the market. Apparently, there is something about meme coins that makes people more than eager to buy as many as they can.  However, investors are eyeing these tokens with suspicions and many of them are opting for more secure options, like AiDoge (AI) and SpongeBobBob (SPONGE). Both of these tokens represent a far better opportunity, focused on the future rather than instant pump-and-dump schemes.  >>> Buy AiDoge Now<<<  HOMER Is A Token With No Promises, No Roadmap, And No Usefulness  Dubbed the DOH Coin, HOMER is a meme coin based on the famous Homer Simpson character. The token made quite a splash on Dexscanner, coming in second with only ETH performing better. This massive success came on the heels of a troublesome presale, which makes it even more impressive.  The HOMER presale ran into troubles almost as soon as it started. Poor security led to a massive bot attack that paralyzed the network and caused a lot of trouble for developers. Regardless, they weren’t deterred and decided to punch through.  The daily trading volume confirmed that their decision was the right one, as people seemingly can’t get enough of HOMER tokens. For the last several days, 24-hour trading volume is constantly north of 440 million, pushing the price upward.  As with most meme coins, HOMER doesn’t have any utility or purpose for that matter. Its value depends solely on the hype its community can create. That is the biggest concern major investors shave about the token and the reason why so many of them decided to opt out and look for better alternatives for investing.  >>> Buy AiDoge Now<<<  SAUDI PEPE – The Arabian Version of Popular Pepe Coin Is Pumping  Pumping more than 1,400% in just one day, Saudi Pepe is among the best-performing cryptocurrencies on the market. Mimicking the token it was named after, Saudi Pepe is performing miraculously on the market, spurring a mad dash among the investors to catch it before it peaks out.  Saudi Pepe is a community project that plays heavily on FOMO in people who missed out on the original Pepe Coin. Judging by the enormous spike in both value and trading volume, the strategy seems to be working exceedingly well. Investors from all over the world are rushing to crypto exchanges and gobbling up the token.  However, some experts warn that not everything is ideal. In fact, there are several glaring red flags that are preventing whales from jumping on board. First is the lack of any info on the team behind the project. Second, and perhaps even more important, is the fear of yet another pump-and-dump scheme, with several anonymous wallets holding huge numbers of the token. If dumped all at once, the price will take a nosedive, leaving smaller investors holding the bag.  >>> Buy SpongeBob Token Now<<<  AiDoge Breaks All Records Raising over $8 Million in Presale  The AI craze sparked by ChatGPT has reached the crypto market in a form of a fun and entertaining app called AiDoge. For some, using a tool as powerful as an AI for generating memes may seem frivolous, but only to those who do not understand the importance of memes in modern online communication. Not only are they an accepted lingua franca for younger generations across the globe, but they are also entertaining.  Creating memes with AiDoge is very simple. All you need is an idea to type in the console and the powerful AI under the hood will do the rest. It will search the net for appropriate images, devise text, and offer you a finished product you can instantly share with your friends.  AiDoge will also feature a handy Meme2Earn function, allowing the best memes to be rewarded with AIDOGE tokens. This will provide the best creators with a source of income and yet another reason to use the app.  The fact that the AIDOGE presale already raised over $8 million in mere weeks is a testament to how popular the concept is. Based on this, many experts predict that AIDOGE will be the next meme coin to explode in 2023, as soon as it hits the open market.  >>> Buy SpongeBob Token Now<<<  SPONGE May Be The Next Big Thing for Meme Coins  SpongeBob token was launched on May 4th and by May 7th it pumped 3179.45%, making it one of the best-performing tokens on the market. For comparison’s sake, in the same period, Pepe Coin gained 271%, vastly underperforming compared to SpongeBob.  Based on the SpongeBobBob SquarePants cartoon character, SpongeBob token followed an unorthodox path to fame. It had a stealth launch on Uniswap DEX, but the word of mouth quickly spread and the token found its way to CoinMarketCap. Just on its first day, SpongeBob gained more than 2,000% for its early investors.  The SpongeBob community is extremely well organized, creating a huge online presence early on. Its Twitter account already has more than 40k followers. The social media campaign was successfully leveraged to incur even higher gains, ending up with SpongeBob’s explosion.  Some experts claim that this is only the beginning. Even though SpongeBob has cooled off some in the last few days, it still remains one of the most prospective meme coins on the market. We can easily see it repeating its amazing gains before the end of 2023.  >>> Buy SpongeBob Token Now<<<  Conclusion  Despite spectacular performances from both Homer and Saudi Pepe, we wouldn’t recommend investing in either of them. There are simply too many unclear issues about these tokens and this lack of transparency is usually a clear indicator of some nefarious intentions. If you are looking for good meme coin investment options, AI and SPONGE are clearly far superior options in every regard.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuYWx5dGljc2luc2lnaHQubmV0L21lbWUtY29pbnMtb24tdGhlLXJpc2UtaG9tZXItc2F1ZGktcGVwZS1leHBsb2RlLWJ1dC1haWRvZ2Utc3BvbmdlLWFyZS10aGUtZnV0dXJlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Noah Calderon, 22, made his first court appearance this week for a federal charge of possession of a destructive device, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Texas said in a news release Tuesday detailing the investigation.  Prosecutors said the FBI was first alerted to Calderon in October after he allegedly posted about white supremacist ideology and a fascination with high-profile mass shootings, ""particularly the 1999 massacre at Columbine High School,"" the statement read.  Calderon's social media included pictures of himself in tactical-style vests with AR-15-style rifles and handguns along with Columbine-themed memes, prosecutors said.  ""This defendant exhibited several indicators of potential violence: a fascination with mass shooters, an obsession with weapons, and hatred towards a protected class. What's worse, he had allegedly progressed from ideation to planning and preparation,"" U.S. Attorney Leigha Simonton said in the news release.  Months later in March, the FBI received a tip that Calderon had detonated a homemade bomb in a residential neighborhood. The explosion prompted several 911 calls about a loud concussive sound and smoke.  ""Shortly thereafter, agents reviewed Mr. Calderon's Google account and found searches for the Columbine killers, the Charleston church shooter, 'pipe bomb how to make,' 'how to make propane bombs,' and 'wear [sic] were the propane bombs in Columbine,' as well as searches of the names of several local public schools. They also searched e-commerce activity, which showed that Mr. Calderon allegedly bought two pounds of potassium perchlorate, one pound of aluminum powder, and a striped fuse online,"" the release said.  A man is in custody and facing weapons charges after a search of his home Monday raised concerns of a potential explosion risk and prompted evacuations.  Calderon was taken into custody in April after Burleson Police and the FBI raided his home and found ""items that could be used to make and detonate a bomb."" Among the evidence taken from the home was a glass jar marked ""frag,"" which contained metal BBs and lead, and 659.2 grams of explosive powder, the release said.  Investigators also found what they described as a handwritten ""manifesto"" which ""glorified the Columbine shooters and espoused white supremacy,"" the release said.  NBC 5 News Investigators search a home along the 700 block of Pecan Street in Burleson, Monday, April 17, 2023.  ""In apprehending Mr. Calderon, we may have averted mass tragedy. We are especially grateful to the tipster who alerted law enforcement to Mr. Calderon's concerning social media posts,"" Simonton stated.  Calderon was charged on April 18 and indicted on May 10 on one count of possession of a destructive device. He made his initial appearance before U.S. Magistrate Judge Jeffrey L. Cureton on Monday.  He faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted.

Director Sam Hargraves revealed to Empire Online that Chris was actually set on fire 'over and over' to get the desired takes.  He told the publication: “For me, the image of Chris Hemsworth beating the s**t out of a bunch of prisoners, while on fire, in the snow was something that I couldn’t pass up. And hats off to Chris. It wasn’t CG fire. And he had to do it over and over.”  Talking to Netflix, Sam said of the sequel: ""The goal was to dive deeper into the backstory of Tyler Rake and find out what makes him tick.  ""We felt we owed it to the audience to give them more insight into what it is that drives him. So, we introduce some new characters that bring his past into greater focus and learn more about where he’s coming from and why he’s doing what he’s doing.""

However, both times, the Wolverines lost in the semifinal. Now, there are concerns that to take the next step forward, Michigan needs to be more explosive in the passing game.  Offensive coordinator Sherrone Moore agreed with that sentiment, explaining that the team has been working on being more consistent this spring.  “I think we have areas that we need to fix, things that we need to be able to exploit defenses more,” Sherrone Moore said. “And we’ve got to be more consistent, whether that’s ball placement, catches, all those things and that just gives you more confidence when you gameplan and things.”  In 2022, Michigan relied heavily on its running game, throwing for just 219.9 yards per game. That was 83rd in the country for that stat.  “And I think in the spring we fixed a lot of those areas, which is really gonna help us when we get to the fall.”  Despite the team struggling to gain yards in the passing game, Sherrone Moore and Michigan are expecting quarterback JJ McCarthy is going to show a lot of improvement in 2022.  “First thing is confidence,” Moore said.  “Just his confidence. He was always a quiet confident kid. But now you can see it zoomed in the way he just walks around, the way he approaches the film room, the way he walks on the field. When he gets out of the huddle, or he looks to the sideline for a play, like the dude just looks like he’s dynamic. Just in the way he approaches everything.”  Sherrone Moore on the potential of Michigan’s wide receivers  JJ McCarthy is going to need some help in the passing game from Michigan’s wide receivers. Luckily, Sherrone Moore thinks the Michigan wide receivers have as much potential as anyone.  “They have potential to be as good as any group in the country. It’s just on the continual work habits that they have, and what they’ve been doing. CJ [Cornelius Johnson] had an outstanding spring. Fixed some things that we wanted him to fix. We put him in a couple different positions to see how he would manage, and he’s just a smart football player, savvy football player. Roman [Wilson] continues to be Roman. Fast, explosive, doing all the things he’s doing. And then exciting to get AJ [Henning] back,” Moore said.  “The other guy that showed up obviously in the spring in Peyton O’Leary, you know who really, really stood out, and he did that all spring. So excited to see him get his chances and roll, and just keep rolling with this group. The young receivers are super dynamic and exciting, so excited for the future of this group and where they are.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5vbjMuY29tL2NvbGxlZ2UvbWljaGlnYW4td29sdmVyaW5lcy9uZXdzL3NoZXJyb25lLW1vb3JlLWFkZHJlc3Nlcy1pZGVhLW1pY2hpZ2FuLW5lZWRzLXRvLWJlLW1vcmUtZXhwbG9zaXZlLW9uLW9mZmVuc2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Given the optimism, it could be wise to add fundamentally strong coal stocks Peabody Energy Corporation (BTU), Alpha Metallurgical Resources, Inc. (AMR), and CONSOL Energy Inc. (CEIX) to your portfolio, trading at discounted valuations.  Over the past year, the coal sector gained traction due to geopolitical tensions and unprecedented economic conditions. The Russian-Ukraine war and the subsequent response from the United States and its allies have had a crippling impact on energy resources, boosting the demand for pivotal commodities globally.  The global coal market grew from $614.96 billion in 2022 to $621.89 billion in 2023 at a CAGR of 1.1%. Furthermore, the coal market is expected to grow to $658.68 billion in 2027 at a CAGR of 1.4%.  Even though some countries have rolled out climate strategies to decarbonize their economies over the coming decades, with gas shortages and a long road ahead to meet global demand for renewable energy, many continue to rely on coal for power and industry.  While coal use is expected to decrease in the long term, demand is set to remain robust in 2023, and consumption is set to hit an all-time high. Emerging and developing economies in Asia are set to increase coal use to help power their economic growth, even as they add more renewables, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).  Furthermore, the market’s continued correction has led to many quality stocks trading at reasonable valuations. Given the fundamental strength, it could be wise to invest in BTU, AMR, and CEIX to gain from their explosive upside.

Two months after the disgraced Vanderpump Rules stars were caught for having a months-long affair by his (now former) girlfriend of nine years Ariana Madix, an insider has claimed that the duo has officially split.  “Raquel dipped out. Sandoval is not the one for her,” the source told Page Six.  The comment was a cheeky reference to Sandoval telling his fellow cast members that Leviss “dipped out” of his house during a recent Vanderpump Rules episode, causing confusion over whether or not she slept over. In case you missed it: she did.  And while performing a gig with his band Tom Sandoval and the Most Extras, he changed the lyrics to the iconic Fountains of Wayne song “Stacy’s Mom” to poke fun at Leviss, who is currently seeking treatment at a mental health facility.  Instead of singing, “Stacy can’t you see, you’re just not the girl for me,” the wannabe rockstar sang, “Schwartzy can’t you see, Raquel is not for me.”  Madix uncovered the affair in early March when she found a sexually explicit screen recording of Sandoval and her close friend on his phone. In a sneak peek for the show’s season finale — which airs tonight — the Something About Her owner reveals that Sandoval and Leviss first had sex in the former Sur waitress’s car shortly after Madix’s dog died.  Photo: Getty Images  “He didn’t have a key to get in so he had to ring the doorbell and I had to let him in,” Madix told her friends in the clip.  Despite Sandoval telling Howie Mandel that he and Leviss were “not putting any label” on their relationship, their co-stars seemed to believe that things were much more serious.

"explosion","2019-02-17","10:00:00","{""Kharkiv"", ""Harkov"", ""Ukraine""}","Wed 17 May 2023 09:08:10","The Russian invasion of Ukraine has put tremendous strain on the strategic partnership between South Africa and the United States. Since the invasion, the South African government has been unwilling to demand that Russia unilaterally put an end to hostilities and withdraw its forces from the sovereign territory of its neighbor.  This is despite the fact that South African foreign policy is supposed to be conducted in accordance with the values and principles set forth in the constitution. This includes the advancement of human rights and promotion of democracy.  The South African government has not appeared especially bothered by this apparent contradiction in their international relations. From its perspective, it has assumed a reasonable stance in a world characterized by an “unequal application” of Western principles in armed conflicts and other insecure environments. To be fair, South Africa is not alone. Just ask India and Vietnam.  The Russian invasion of Ukraine has exposed the practical limits of the strategic partnership between South Africa and the United States. Recent events suggest those limits include the provisioning of military products and services to the Russian government and Russian private military contractors.  Now, questions have been raised as to whether the South African government crossed that line and, if so, does that count as a redline in the strategic partnership for the US government. While the world awaits the answers, it is important for regional observers to reflect on the series of events that led to this historic low in relations between South Africa and the United States.  That requires a rapid tracing of the series of events that led to US Ambassador, Reuben Brigety, going out and leveling public accusations against the African National Congress and the South African government. When viewed in this context, it becomes clear that the ambassador’s remarks are effectively an acknowledgment of the structural instabilities that exist in the strategic partnership between South Africa and the United States.  The Ramaphosa administration and Biden administration will need to mitigate those instabilities with haste. Otherwise, the strategic partnership could very well collapse before next year’s national elections in both countries. That is the reality.  US Ambassador Reuben Brigety suspects South Africa is doing deals with Russia. Image: Twitter  Contentious context  Last March, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa insinuated that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) instigated the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In his words, the “war could have been avoided if NATO had heeded the warnings from amongst its own leaders and officials over the years that its eastward expansion would lead to greater, not less, instability in the region.”  For that reason, he indicated that South Africa would not take “a very adversarial stance against Russia.” In October, the South African government went further. It gave permission to dock to a Russian superyacht that was under Western sanctions. This was justified on the grounds that the South African government does not have a “legal obligation to abide by sanctions” that are imposed by Western governments.  Last December, a Russian cargo ship was dispatched to South Africa. In the vicinity of Naval Base Simon’s Town, its crew may have switched off its maritime tracking system. Soon, local residents observed the Western-sanctioned vessel docked at the largest base of the South African Navy. There, local residents reported materials being loaded and unloaded the ship “under the cover of darkness.”  When questioned, Defense Spokesperson Kobus Marais responded that, to the best of his knowledge, the ship had docked to offload “an old, outstanding order for ammunition.” According to Julius Malema of the Economic Freedom Fights, there was nothing inappropriate with such a transfer since it is “consistent with international best practice to honor contractual trade obligations and relationships.”  A few weeks later, the African National Congress hosted its 55th National Conference. There, the African National Congress openly criticized American foreign policy. In the Resolution on International Relations, the African National Congress observed that “US-led expansionist military strategies” had resulted in “Western imperialist dominance over Eastern Europe.”  As an anti-imperialist and anti-colonial party, the African National Congress not only decried “a conspicuous failure of the current global institutions to resolve conflicts fairly, justly and equitably in order to safeguard the interests of all nations.” It went further. It concluded that the Russia-Ukrainian War was “provoked” by an American government pursuing an imperialist agenda that was informed by the Wolfowitz Doctrine.  In February, Airports Company South Africa proposed structural changes to its fueling operations at its airports. These changes were designed to separate refueling operations from thru-putting to ensure that “a sanctioned friend of the South African government” would receive “servicing and refueling” as needed.  This division was intended to break forced alignment “with the stance the oil companies’ headquarters and home countries take in terms of sanctions against Russia.” Note, this move followed at least two earlier incidents where international oil companies had actually refused to refuel the Russian aircraft under Western sanctions that had been granted permission to land at commercial airports in South Africa.  These refusals had angered some members of parliament from the African National Congress who demanded public assurances that the state-owned airport management company would not “indirectly impose” Western sanctions on Russia. After those assurances were given, Air BP decided to cease all operations in South Africa.  Around the same time, the South African government hosted a major military exercise between China, Russia, and South Africa. Those exercises coincided with the one year anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. They also involved the Russian frigate Admiral Gorshkov, which was armed with Zircon hypersonic missiles.  Prior to the exercises, there was an official visit by Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, with the South African Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, Naledi Pandor. On the sidelines, Minister Pandor stressed that it would be “an abuse of international practice” to prevent the South African government from conducting ”military exercises with friends.” In the end, the US government expressed public concern about the exercises.  South African Minister of International Relations Naledi Pandor (right) and her Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov shake hands before talks in Pretoria on January 23, 2022. Image: Screengrab / NDTV  The US Embassy in South Africa cautioned that the exercises would not only present the South African government with a diplomatic challenge. It would lead South Africans to ask whether their country should be “associated with the symbol ‘Z’ painted on the side of the frigate the Admiral Gorshkov.”  In April, a Russian cargo plane owned by an American-sanctioned company was permitted to land at Waterkloof Air Force Base. The plane purportedly delivered diplomatic mail to the Russian embassy.  However, the company reportedly has “handled cargo shipments for sanctioned Russian Federation defense entities” in the past. A few weeks later, Assistant Secretary for Arms Control, Verification and Compliance Mallory Stewart was dispatched to South Africa and Egypt.  Note, Egypt is another country where suspicions have been raised about illicit weapons transfers to Russia. Between May 9-10, Assistant Secretary Stewart held talks with senior government officials at the Department of International Relations and Cooperation Republic of South Africa. Around the same time, the main opposition party, Democratic Alliance, issued a public statement chastizing the African National Congress for abusing Air Force Base Waterkloof and Naval Base Simonstown for their “narrow political interests.”  They also submitted a Promotion of Access to Information Act (PAIA) application requesting the disclosure of “who authorized the landing at Waterkloof and the docking at the naval base, including the type of goods that were brought in and out.”  Heated accusations  On May 11, bilateral relations finally boiled over. During a press briefing, US Ambassador Reuben declared that “the South African government is in fact not not aligned” with Russia. This led to a rapid deterioration in the strategic partnership between South Africa and the United States.  In his remarks, the ambassador went on to outline a series of accusations against the African National Congress. He observed that its senior leadership had published “outrageous” and “patently false” statements in the Resolution on International Relations that were openly “hostile” to the national security interests of the US government.  Moreover, he maintained that the African National Congress Headquarters, Luthuli House, had been unresponsive to his repeated attempts to open dialogue on these matters. To rub salt in the wound, Ambassador Reuben confirmed the existence of intelligence that showed that weapons and ammunition were loaded onto the Russian vessel at Naval Base Simon’s Town.  In his words, the US government was “confident that weapons were loaded into that vessel, and I would bet my life on the accuracy of that assertion.” He characterized such behavior by a strategic partner as “fundamentally unacceptable.”  The South African government was quick to respond to the allegations regarding the arms transfer at Naval Base Simon’s Town. The spokesperson to the President, Vincent Magwenya, claimed that the ambassador had undermined “the spirit of cooperation and partnership” that existed between the two countries in resolving the matter.  He noted that the South African government had launched “an independent inquiry” into the accusations made by the US government, and the two countries had agreed to allow that investigation “to run its course,” with the United States Intelligence Community providing supporting evidence.  For its part, the South African Department of Defense issued a statement in support of the independent investigation as it would provide “an opportunity to ventilate its side of the story with concrete evidence,” and thereby “deal with allegations surrounding the purpose of such a visit in front of a competent officer of the law instead of hearsay or speculation.”  Separately, the South African government issued a démarche to the ambassador through diplomatic channels. This led to the arrangement of a meeting between Ambassador Reuben and Foreign Minister Pandor. Following that meeting, the South African government reaffirmed that the National Conventional Arms Control Committee had never approved of a “sale of arms to Russia related to the period and incident in question.”  Noting that the independent inquiry would provide a “platform to establish facts and role players in the incident in question,” the South African government promised that anyone “found to have broken the law will face consequences.”  Moving forward, the South African government claimed that an agreement had been reached to “use established diplomatic channels to raise whatever issue may arise in the management of the bilateral relations between the two countries.”  For his part, Ambassador Reuben noted that the meeting had provided a platform to “correct any mis-impressions left by [his] public remarks.” Perhaps not surprisingly, he never provided clarification on what, if any, mis-impressions had arisen.  Acrimonious aftermath  This breakdown in bilateral relations brought about a wide array of secondary effects. One of the first dominos to fall was the South African economy.  Almost immediately, South African bond yields skyrocketed due to investor concerns quoted in Bloomberg that “a diplomatic row” between Pretoria and Washington could put “preferential trade access … worth billions of dollars to South Africa at risk.” In parallel, the South African rand fell “to the weakest level on record against the dollar.”  This was after the rand had recently fallen to a three-year low due to increasing fears “of scheduled blackouts known as loadshedding worsening during winter.” Investors were spooked. And, they seemed to have good reasons for it. The main opposition party pointed out that “close to 77% of foreign direct investment stock” of South Africa has come from the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States in recent years.  Domestic politics was another arm to cascade. In South Africa, Clement Manyathela cautioned his listeners that the South African government “has been cagey about this Russian vessel for so long – since its arrival and dawn departure. There has been no official explanation from the Department of Defense. No explanation from the South African National Defense Force. No explanation from the Navy either.  “This is despite a number of calls from politicians. Repeated media requests for information. So whatever information the government gives you now, take it with a pinch of salt. They were never interested in transparency from the word go. So anything is possible.”  With such doubts being expressed by the media a year out from a national election, it is not surprising that national politicians tried to capitalize on the controversy for political gain.  The strongest recriminations have been leveled by the Democratic Alliance. That party not only suggested that “President Ramaphosa and his government have already lied to South Africa and the world as to our country’s involvement in this devastating conflict.”  They said that it “signals” that South Africa has, under the leadership of the African National Congress, “regressed into a nation that has abandoned the principles of freedom, fairness, and equality.”  As the Shadow Minister for International Relations and Cooperation volleyed, the South African government is now “complicit in a war of aggression that … risks undermining both our domestic priorities and international peace and security.” ActionSA leadership expressed similar beliefs that the South African government has “never had a non-aligned approach to the Ukraine-Russian war.”  Rather than “supporting Russia during the ongoing war,” its politicians demanded that the South African government “come clean about … support for a dictatorial regime which is alleged to be actively funding” the African National Congress.  Russian President Putin and South African President Ramaphosa share a private word. Image: Facebook  The Economic Freedom Fighters have waged a radically different attack. Its leader, Julius Malema, argued that “American concerns are misplaced.” He claimed that the South African government “has got no capacity to empower Russians with weapons against their own handlers.”  Using inflammatory language, he went even further. He alleged that the US government “is just becoming a crybaby trying to find a way into punishing South Africa because of our position on the Russia-Ukraine war.”  The National Freedom Party charted a similar tack. Its leadership condemned the decision by the South African government “to establish a commission of inquiry into the alleged supply of weapons to Russia.”  In their words, the United States government has no “moral authority to make any demands or claims against the South African Government given the fact that it is the USA and its allies that are supplying arms and ammunition to the Ukrainians in this proxy war with Russia.”  In the United States, the harshest criticisms have been voiced by a Member of Congress from the Republican Party. After the news of the incident broke, the Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Jim Risch, publicly rebuked the South African government for its “anti-American screeds” and maltreatment of an American ambassador. As for the démarche, he added that such behavior “doesn’t reflect friendship or a neutral partner.”  Afterward, Ranking Member Risch extended a jab across the domestic political aisle when he publicly criticized the US government for failing to stand behind an American ambassador who “spoke honestly about an issue of grave concern to US national security.”  These words will resonate with other Members of Congress who have previously called on the US government to keep Congress better apprised of the strategic partnership by providing regular and comprehensive briefings on subjects relating to South Africa.

"explosion","2022-04-15","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 17:01:00","PRECIOUS METALS  Approximately 12 years ago, I wrote my first public market prognostication, and it was focused on gold, states Avi Gilburt of ElliotWaveTrader.net.  At the time, gold was enjoying a parabolic rally, and the discussion amongst the general public was how far past the $2,000 mark gold was going to strike during that rally.  So, on Aug. 11, 2011, I concluded my first gold article as follows:  ""Again, since we are most probably in the final stages of this parabolic fifth wave ""blow-off-top,"" I would seriously consider anything approaching the $1,915 level to be a potential target for a top at this time.""  Needless to say, my first market prognostication was not met with tremendous support. These are a sample of the comments I received from readers when I was calling for a metals market top:  ""With all due respect Avi, you plainly do not understand the gold market.""  ""Your TA is useless. You don't understand the fundamentals because you only look to the past. Gold bulls are forward-thinking. The times they are a changing...""  ""The problem is that TA is like driving a car by only looking in the rear-view mirror....There is no foresight involved; it's all based on past performance. The future of the fundamentals is what you fail to grasp.""  ""There is no way you can understand what is going on in gold by doing technical analysis. Gold is driven by fundamentals.""  ""Technical analyses is all well and good, but you cannot apply it to the PM sector which has been artificially manipulated and suppressed for years.""  Yet, as we now know, gold struck a top within $6 of the top for which I was calling.  What many may have seen as either ignorance or hubris, I even provided my downside target even before gold topped, wherein I explained my expectation for gold to drop back down to the $1,000 region.  ""Based upon the Elliott Wave Principle, I would expect a very large pullback. In fact, the target for such a pullback will probably be a minimum low of $1,400, it could fall as low as $1000, or even as low as $700. It will depend upon how the decline takes form. But those are very viable targets for gold on the downside.""  The comments regarding my views were basically the same as above, so, I will just note one of the more ""reasonable"" comments:  ""There is no way to rationalize $700 gold with 50% debasement of currency expected over the next five years as US debt grows to $21 trillion from $14. It makes no sense to my feeble mind. I vote for $3000 vs. $1900 today. That makes sense to my mind.""  As you can see, it was quite clear at the time that the ""fundamentals"" were keeping most metals bulls looking to the long side. And, amazingly, those same fundamentals kept the metals bulls looking to the long side of the market during the entire decline.  But what was truly amazing was that as gold was approaching its long-term low struck at the end of 2015, almost the entire market turned bearish and was again ""certain"" that it would continue in its downside trajectory (just as strongly as they were certain we would eclipse $2,000 in 2011), with most now turning from bullish to predicting a drop below $1,000.  Well, just like everyone was uber-bullish at the highs when we expected a major top, we turned bullish when everyone turned uber-bearish. On Dec. 30, 2015, I urged investors to be moving back into the metals complex as we were looking for a long-term bottom to be struck imminently due to the significant bearishness evident in the market:  ""As we move into 2016, I believe there is a greater than 80% probability that we finally see a long-term bottom formed in the metals and miners and the long-term bull market resumes. Those that followed our advice in 2011 and moved out of this market for the correction we expected, are now moving back into this market as we approach the long-term bottom. In 2011, before gold even topped, we set our ideal target for this correction in the $700-$1,000 region in gold. We are now reaching our ideal target region, and the pattern we have developed over the last four years is just about complete. [...] For those interested in my advice, I would highly suggest you start moving back into this market with your long-term money.""  In fact, back in September 2015, when the metals mining companies were absolutely hated by the investor community, I rolled out a service on ElliottWaveTrader specifically to focus on the mining industry. We began urging our clients to buy mining stocks during the last quarter of 2015. In fact, I bought stocks such as Newmont Mining (NEM) in the $15-17 region at the time. NEM was my largest holding in the complex since that time.  Now, fast forward to 2022, and gold had been stuck in a correction since a local top was struck back in August of 2020. Yet, there were pockets within the market that still rallied into 2022.  An example of such outperformance in 2022 included NEM, which went on to strike higher highs in April of 2022. Yet, when NEM struck the 84-85 region, I outlined to the members of Elliottwavetrader that, for the first time since I bought NEM in 2015, I was selling almost my entire holdings in the company. You see, I set a target of 82-89 when NEM was hovering in the 28 region. And, when we moved into my target region, I stuck with my plan and sold my largest holding in the complex. Since that time, NEM dropped 57% off its highs.  So, back in January, I provided you with my latest assessment of the gold market, with an expectation for gold to rally to the $2,428 region in this current move off the early November low. I also noted that we can certainly even blow through that, depending upon the extensions we see in the upcoming rally, but that target was a solid one for now. Clearly, I will re-assess the target once the next bullish phase begins in earnest.  And, then in April, I outlined my expectation for the metals market to begin its next rally to the $2,200+ region. My expectation was that a break-out through $2,075 would trigger that next bigger move. Yet, while the market spiked to $2,085 in early May, I warned the members of Elliottwavetrader that the structure of that move did not look like it was starting that rally to $2,200 just yet, and I expected more of a pullback. So, while the market did spike through $2,075, it clearly was not able to sustain that rally, as we expected, and it immediately spiked back down below.  At this time, I am still expecting a fast and strong rally to $2,200+ in the coming months. A breakout over $2,085 will likely now be the trigger.  Silver is providing us with a relatively low-risk buying opportunity, as it is set up to see a very strong upside follow-through when this pullback completes.  To keep it very simple, we have been outlining to the members of Elliottwavetrader our expectation for the pullback we are now seeing in silver, and it is now striking our general target region for this expected pullback. As long as silver holds over $22.50, I am expecting this pullback to complete over the coming week or two and set us up for a strong rally which should be pointing us north of 27 rather quickly.

Lynn Fire Chief Daniel Sullivan, Department of Conservation & Recreation Chief Fire Warden David Celino, and State Fire Marshal Peter Ostroskey said that about 400 acres of land had burned as a result of suspicious fires set over a period of several days.  “Any fire can present a hazard, but we saw rapid fire growth threatening numerous homes in our community as a result of these fires,” said Chief Sullivan. “Firefighters from Lynn and our mutual aid partners worked extraordinarily hard to bring them under control, and we’re extremely fortunate that we had no serious injuries or property damage.”  “Fires like these put people, property, and wildlife at risk,” said Chief Fire Warden Celino. “We’re experiencing Red Flag conditions across Massachusetts right now, with high winds, low humidity, and very dry fuel. Outdoor fires will burn rapidly, spread quickly, and produce dangerous fire behavior under these conditions. That puts an enormous strain on firefighters, their departments, and the communities they serve.”  Based on ongoing efforts by fire investigators from the Lynn Fire Department and the State Police Fire & Explosion Investigation Unit assigned to the State Fire Marshal’s office, officials believe that eight separate fires were intentionally set on May 12, May 13, and May 17. They are asking anyone with information on these incidents to share it with investigators.  Anyone who made observations in the area of the Lynn Woods Reservation on these dates or has other information on the fires can contact the State Police Fire & Explosion Investigation Unit at 978-567-3310 or the Arson Watch Reward Program at 1-800-682-9225. The Arson Watch Reward Program is overseen by the Massachusetts Property Insurance Underwriters Association and offers rewards of up to $5,000. Tipsters may remain anonymous if they wish.  “About 40% of Massachusetts home are in or near wildland areas,” said State Fire Marshal Ostroskey. “Setting a fire in this environment is a particularly dangerous act, especially under the current weather conditions.

""Essentially, it allows us to continue to receive funding from outside sources,"" Lineaweaver said. ""It allows us to receive help from sources that we may not be able to if we don't have the emergency declaration extended.""  Lineaweaver said this is the third time the local disaster emergency declaration has been extended. It will run through the council meeting on June 20. Lineaweaver said it is mainly state assistance.

The Douglas bats put that idea on ice in the second inning, when they brought 14 batters to the plate, hit three home runs, and scored nine runs. The Eagles then put it in cruise control, and sailed to a 10-1 win, and their third straight state final four appearance.  “I can’t say enough about our offensive approaches tonight,” said Douglas Manager Todd Fitz-Gerald. “We were locked in and stuck to the plan.”  The plan, it turns out, was similar to their regional semifinal game against Taravella, when the Eagles put up 10 runs in the first two innings. Douglas has now outscored their five playoff opponents by a combined 57-9.  Having a nine run lead in the second inning is insurmountable no matter when it happens. But when facing the most dominant pitcher of the past three seasons, Douglas’ ace Christian Rodriguez, the task becomes even more daunting.  Rodriguez threw six innings, limiting the Explorers hitters to just three hits and one run. He struck out four on the evening, before he gave way to Gavin Gargiulo, who closed out the regional final win with two strikeouts in the seventh.  The game served as the last one ever at home for Rodriguez, who has compiled a 12-0 record in 2023. Overall, Rodriguez is 30-1 in his high school career, with a 1.30 career ERA, to go along with 304 strikeouts in 183.2 innings.  “I couldn’t be happier for C-Rod, going out like he did in his final home game,” said Fitz-Gerald. “He has been such a special person in my life since he was seven years old. I’m like his second dad, and I love him immensely.”  With Rodriguez locking it down on the mound, the Eagles offensive explosion in the second came courtesy of some familiar names. Matt Ossenfort hit a double, and a home run in the inning. The homer was the third in two games for the senior first baseman. Ossenfort’s blast was followed by a Nico Benestad home run. Later in the inning, Alex Rodriguez connected for the third homer of the inning.  With the win, Douglas moves on to the 7A semifinals. Awaiting them will be Spruce Creek, with manager Matt Cleveland, a former longtime Broward County manager. The other semifinal will feature Plant, out of Tampa, and Park Vista, a team Douglas beat 8-2 earlier this season.  Douglas will be chasing history, with no public school team in Broward County history ever having an undefeated season. The Eagles sit at 27-0.  “I’m so happy for the boys and the coaches,” said Fitz-Gerald. “I want this for them, and couldn’t be more excited for this opportunity.”  To exemplify just how good Douglas has been this season, consider that they have only trailed for a total of five innings the entire season, and all five innings, they only trailed 1-0.  Furthermore, the Eagles have faced a whopping 16 teams that are ranked in the Top 10 of their sites HSBN Power Rankings. The total score combined in those 16 wins is 120-21. Two of those teams are defending state champions, and are heading back to states this year (Doral, North Broward Prep). To see just how unprecedented that is, here is a breakdown of the ranked teams they have beat, with the scores.

"explosion","2023-02-26","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 14:31:30","The market for stolen data logs is booming and information stealing malware is becoming “a natural choice” for cybercriminals seeking a quick way to infiltrate businesses, according to new research from Secureworks.  Infostealers pilfer login credentials, financial details, and personal data from infected computers and networks, and a report published Tuesday by the vendor’s Counter Threat Unit claims the tools are becoming more sophisticated and harder to detect, posing a growing challenge for defenders of corporate networks.  Threat groups package and sell the exfiltrated data as logs which can be used to break into enterprise networks via remote access services, like virtual private networks (VPNs) and Microsoft Office Web Access (OWA).  Secureworks research found that since June 2021, the number of logs for sale on Russian Market – the largest dark web market for infostealer logs, - was up 670%. It grew by 150% from June 2022, when there were 2 million logs for sale on a single day, to 5 million in late February 2023.  “Coordinated global action by law enforcement is having some impact, but cybercriminals are adept at reshaping their routes to market,” said Don Smith, vice president for threat research at SecureWorks.  Despite multiple arrests and the takedown of 11 domains associated with Genesis Market last month, the Tor site remained operational with logs still available for sale. Activity had slowed, however, and criminals had been observed on underground forums discussing their concerns about using the market.  Telegram has been a beneficiary of this, with more buying and selling of logs for popular stealers such as RedLine, Anubis, SpiderMan and Oski Stealer shifting to dedicated Telegram channels, Secureworks found.  The malware is also becoming cheaper and easier for relatively inexperienced cybercriminals to use, and the popularity of working from home and bring your own device (BYOD) policies have led to a surge in opportunities for corporate assets to be infected by personal devices. Many underground forums sell the tool as part of a monthly subscription package for prices that range between $50 and $1,000 per month.  “Infostealers are a natural choice for cybercriminals who are looking to rapidly gain access to businesses and then monetize that access,” said Smith. “They are readily available for purchase, and within as little as 60 seconds generate an immediate result in the form of stolen credentials and other sensitive information.”  Smith said the innovative ways criminals were finding to trick users into installing the malware, such as via fake messaging apps and cloned websites, “has really changed the game.”  Secureworks said the growing popularity of malware-as-a-service within the criminal underworld had sparked innovation among developers to improve their products and appeal to a wider range of customers.  For example, Russian Market started offering users the option to pre-order stolen credentials for a specific organization, business, or application. While there were no guarantees pre-orders would be fulfilled, buyers who deposited $1,000 into the site’s escrow system could request credentials based on a specified domain name.  The SecureWorks report claims the use of infostealers is now so widespread, an entire secondary market has popped up for individuals who can parse raw log data into common or usable formats for a fee.  “What we are seeing is an entire underground economy and supporting infrastructure built around infostealers, making it not only possible but also potentially lucrative for relatively low-skilled threat actors to get involved,” Smith said.  Because of their ability to discreetly and efficiently exfiltrate sensitive data from targeted systems, the tools are also popular with state-sponsored threat groups that focused on cyberespionage operations.  During the war in Ukraine, Russian threat actors had deployed the Graphiron infostealer to target Ukrainian organizations. Chinese state-sponsored threat groups had also been observed using infostealers.  Smith said there were a range of measures organizations could take to reduce the risk of data theft.  “Ensuring that you implement multi-factor authentication to minimize the damage caused by the theft of credentials, being careful about who can install third-party software and where it is downloaded from, and implementing comprehensive monitoring across host, network and cloud are all key aspects of a successful defense against the threat of infostealers.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbWFnYXppbmUuY29tL25ld3MvdGhyZWF0LWludGVsbGlnZW5jZS9kYXRhLWxvZy10aGVmdHMtZXhwbG9kZS1hcy1pbmZvc3RlYWxlcnMtZ2Fpbi1wb3B1bGFyaXR5LXdpdGgtY3liZXJjcmltaW5hbHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"explosion","2023-12-15","Not Discerned","{""Dallas"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 23:34:05","Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Michael Gallup is ready to get his NFL career back on track. Dallas' third-round pick in the 2018 NFL Draft burst onto the scene with career-highs in receptions (66), receiving yards (1,107) and receiving touchdowns (six) at 23 years old in 2019. Then a gruesome, season-ending ankle injury to quarterback Dak Prescott hampered his development in 2020, and a season-ending torn ACL in Week 17 of the 2021 season against the Arizona Cardinals set him back much further.  The effects from coming back from the severe knee injury showed externally on the field -- Gallup totaled a career-low 424 receiving yards last season -- but he was also dealing with the mental hurdle of trusting his movements, which was nearly as big of an issue.  ""I was thinking too much [last season],"" Gallup said Wednesday, via The Athletic. ""My knee was feeling sore and it was just different. I never really had it like that last year.""  A little more than 16 months removed from suffering the injury, Gallup is in a completely different place and confident he can return to form. Dallas is banking on it considering it signed him to a five-year, $57.5 million deal in the 2022 offseason, shortly after the injury.  ""It's different,"" Gallup said when asked about his knee now. ""I feel springy again.""  Michael Gallup DAL • WR • #13 TAR 74 REC 39 REC YDs 424 REC TD 4 FL 0 View Profile  The 2023 season will also be different for Gallup because he will be returning to the role he thrived in, as the team's third receiver, when he and quarterback Dak Prescott were last both healthy for an entire season and four-time Pro Bowl wideout Amari Cooper was on the roster. Once again, Dallas has two high-caliber pass-catchers in front of him in 2022 second-team All-Pro CeeDee Lamb and offseason trade acquisition Brandin Cooks.  The Silver and Blue acquired the soon-to-be 30-year-old in March from the Houston Texans in exchange for a 2023 fifth-round pick and a 2024 sixth-round pick. The Cowboys then promptly signed him to a two-year, $20 million extension that locks him in with the team through the 2024 season.  Getting Cooks was a big deal. Since 2014 when he entered the league, he's one of seven players with more than 8,500 receiving yards (8,616) and 45 receiving touchdowns (49). Alongside Cooks in that exclusive club is Davante Adams, Mike Evans, DeAndre Hopkins, Travis Kelce, Stefon Diggs and Antonio Brown.  Cooks' six career seasons of at least 1,000 receiving yards are tied for the third-most in the NFL since 2014, trailing only Evans (nine) and Kelce (seven). He has achieved the feat with each of his four previous teams: the New Orleans Saints (2015-16), New England Patriots (2017), Los Angeles Rams (2018) and Texans (2020-21). Doing so in 2021 with Houston is especially noteworthy given he was catching passes from 32-year-old Tyrod Taylor and rookie Davis Mills. Gallup could hardly contain his excitement when talking about being able to start alongside him.  ""Oh man, Brandin Cooks, I'm talking about a 10-year vet that has [six] seasons over 1,000 yards,"" Gallup said. ""He's just bringing knowledge to the whole group, and we love him in [the wide receivers room]. I ain't going to lie to you. He has been in there every day, working, just trying to win. That's all he wants to do is just win, and he wants to do it as a group. He's a great addition.""  Brandin Cooks DAL • WR • #3 TAR 93 REC 57 REC YDs 699 REC TD 3 FL 0 View Profile  The most significant pearls of wisdom Cooks has imparted on Dallas' young pass-catchers have been about the keys to extending their careers: taking care of their bodies.  ""Getting your body right. That's all he keeps preaching. He talks to everybody, 'When you are done with this, you're done with that, make sure you stretch. Make sure you do what you're supposed to do so you can stay in the league as long as you possibly can.' That's one of the biggest things right now. Football, that's going to be there. We got in the league for a reason, but he's over here talking about how you stay in the league. That's the knowledge he's bringing.""  Alongside Lamb and Cooks, Gallup and his healthy knees are finally ready to turn the clock back to 2019.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNzcG9ydHMuY29tL25mbC9uZXdzL2Nvd2JveXMtbWljaGFlbC1nYWxsdXAtZmVlbHMtc3ByaW5neS1hZ2Fpbi1yZWFkeS10by1yZXR1cm4tdG8tMjAxOS1mb3JtLXdpdGgtYW5vdGhlci1leHBsb3NpdmUtd3ItdHJpby_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"explosion","2023-05-17","Not Discerned","{""Madras"", ""TamilNadu"", ""India""}","Wed 17 May 2023 18:02:00","For foreign audiences, Indian cinema long has been closely associated with Bollywood — sprawling, colorful spectacles that feature songs and dance routines — and often one of the three Khans (the unrelated trio of Aamir, Salman and Shah Rukh). But there has been a shift across the past year as focus turned from Mumbai, which had suffered a string of misses until Shah Rukh Khan’s Pathaan took off on a tear early this year, toward Southern India.  The Indian film industry is one of the world’s most prolific, but it somehow feels like a switch has been flipped with interest from non-diaspora audiences. In part, that’s down to S.S. Rajamouli and his Telugu-language pic RRR, which became a phenomenon unto its own with worldwide box office appeal and awards recognition from myriad bodies including the Academy, which made “Naatu Naatu” the first song from an Indian movie to win an Oscar.  Rajamouli already had made waves globally with his two-part Baahubali franchise. But RRR put Telugu titles into the mainstream outside India, arguably fueling growth in so-called pan-India movies. RRR’s N.T. Rama Rao Jr. (NTR) recently was set to star with Hrithik Roshan in War 2, which, along with Pathaan, forms part of Yash Raj Films’ Spy Universe. The crossover could give War 2 wider audience appeal.  RELATED: Cannes Film Festival Photo Gallery Of Premieres & Parties  India, a multilingual and multi-ethnic country, consists of several different industries corresponding to different states, such as Bollywood (Hindi cinema), Tollywood (Telugu cinema) and Kollywood (Tamil cinema).  (L-R) Scarlett Mellish Wilson, Prabhas, Nora Fatehi and Sneha Upadhyay in ‘Baahubali: The Beginning’ Birch Tree Entertainment/Everett Collection  Given that Hindi is understood in almost three-quarters of India, Bollywood historically was the dominant player. As box office analyst Jatinder Singh says, “Due to the language barrier, the industries like Tollywood and Kollywood remained regional players, catering only to their state primarily.” That was until South Indian films began getting dubbed into Hindi — mostly for TV but also coinciding with the emergence of multiplexes in India, especially in the north. The multiplexes and their higher ticket prices, Singh says, “started making cinemagoing an elitist activity, and Bollywood started to cater to these multiplex audiences, cutting down on larger-than-life commercial masala films.” In turn, South Indian films dubbed into Hindi began to dominate television, too, as they provided what Bollywood was not delivering.  RELATED: Cannes Film Festival Full Coverage  Then, in a watershed moment in 2015, a Hindi version of Rajamouli’s Baahubali: The Beginning was released theatrically and became a huge breakout success. In 2017, the sequel followed suit. As the audience expanded for South Indian films, so did budgets and production values.  Says Sri Harsha Chundru, co-founder of Walls & Trends, which marketed RRR and regularly works with major titles: “Telugu cinema has proved that language does not matter. A good and emotional story can transcend linguistic and socio-cultural barriers. Also, we are one of the few industries that managed to strike a balance between commercial or colloquially speaking ‘mass’ elements and a larger-than-life message or any other inspiring and message-oriented takeaways. I think RRR and other unapologetic entertainers, so to speak, have paved the way for mainstream commercial cinema and inspired other filmmakers to dream big.”  He calls Telugu cinema “a melting pot of culture,” suggesting that audiences can expect “many more multi-starrer films featuring actors from different industries across India, if not the world.” Whatever comes next, it will be, “bigger, better and bolder.”  RELATED: Cannes Palme d’Or Winners Through The Years: Photo Gallery  But Chundru also predicts: “While the quality of VFX and graphics are likely to exponentially improve, there will be a rise in small-budget films as well. Large-scale Telugu films put Telugu cinema as a whole in the limelight, so audiences across the world would be eager to explore more of Telugu cinema in all its shapes and forms.”  Actress Pooja Hegde, who has appeared in Telugu, Tamil and Hindi films, says that while the perception from outside of India is that Telugu cinema has only just emerged in the past year, this is not the case. It has been “years of audience building, hard work, and love. And when the dubbed versions were released simultaneously with the original language version in the theaters, the payoff has been huge. It is encouraging that the West is beginning to understand that India is a very culturally diverse country and that there is more to it than just Hindi films. There is a lot of talent in India and film industries from across the states are producing exceptional films, be it through its storytelling or technical skills.”  Allu Arjun in ‘Pushpa: The Rise Part 01’ Classics Entertainment/Everett Collection  Says Singh, “2022 felt like it was the year when the result of this was on full display as multiple South Indian Hindidubbed films found success.” Those also include Pushpa: The Rise — Part 01, Kantara, Karthikeya 2, Vikram and Ponniyin Selvan: Part I.  Anticipation ahead is high for upcoming Tollywood titles including Ram Charan’s Game Changer, NTR’s next untitled pic and Hombale Films’ Telugu-language action thriller Salaar, starring Prabhas, who also features in Yash Raj’s Project K with Deepika Padukone and Amitabh Bachchan for release in early 2024. Hombale, which released Prashanth Neel’s Yash-starring Kannada-language smash KGF: Chapter 2, also is working on Kannada-language Kantara 2, directed by and starring Rishab Shetty. It’s part of an ambitious slate across four South Indian languages from the studio, which recently pledged to invest $370 million in films and series over the next five years.  RELATED: India Recorded Second-Biggest Box Office Year Ever In 2022 With $1.28B, But Admissions Still Down On Pre-Pandemic Levels  “There is a great exchange of culture that is happening right now,” RRR star Charan says. “The boundaries are becoming seamless and blurred, and I think it’s important that my nation calls themselves the Indian film industry rather than sectioning ourselves into different industries. … I’m happy that I’m in an era where this change is happening. It’s good to be part of the global film industry now.”  Dylan Marchetti of Variance Films, who, alongside Potentate Films, Sarigama Cinemas and Raftar Creations, released RRR in the U.S. and led the Academy push, said recently that RRR could be a “gateway drug,” adding: “There are a lot of people — programmers, bookers, industry people — who were only peripherally aware of Telegu/South Indian cinema. There will be more films like this that can cross over.”  Read the digital edition of Deadline’s Disruptors/Cannes magazine here  Today he remains bullish. “There’s always going to be an audience of film lovers that, if it’s good, they’ll find it. I’m interested in developing the secondary Western audience that needs to be marketed to. That audience, as it grows, will have offshoots leaning more toward action or the fantastical. You need to have a steady supply and marketing in conjunction with the global release. I think there’s a hunger now.”  Variance is looking for the next title to bring to U.S. cinemas. “We are doing our part to put the best of the best in front of the audience,” Marchetti says. “There is a curiosity — once you’ve seen something you’ve never seen before, you want to see more. My hope is that it continues to advance people’s minds.” He points to examples like 2000’s Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, which spurred folks to dig more into martial arts movies, or the success of Parasite, which turned them on to Korean cinema.  Rajamouli has said previously that the success of RRR and the rise of Telugu cinema is “really important” to him. “Because now I can expand even more,” he explained. “More and more films are going to come and cross these language barriers and tap into people across larger areas. Hopefully, we grow beyond, not just in the country, but into other countries, cultures and languages as well.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvcnJyLXNvdXRoLWluZGlhbi1maWxtLWV4cGFuc2lvbi1wYXRoYWFuLXNoYWgtcnVraC1rYWhuLXNzLXJhamFtb3VsaS0xMjM1MzYyODU4L9IBcGh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvcnJyLXNvdXRoLWluZGlhbi1maWxtLWV4cGFuc2lvbi1wYXRoYWFuLXNoYWgtcnVraC1rYWhuLXNzLXJhamFtb3VsaS0xMjM1MzYyODU4L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Atypical myopathy – a condition that weakens a horse’s muscles – can occur when toxin hypoglycin A, found in sycamore seeds, is ingested.

The British Equine Veterinary Association (BEVA) said the huge number of toxic seeds are now sprouting in numerous places, including pastures and hay fields, “causing an alarming second rise in cases of atypical myopathy”.  Vet Phil Cramp lost his 13-year-old “gentle giant” Dermot to the condition last month.  “We’d been on a fun ride; he had a great time and was happy,” Mr Cramp told H&H. “But when we got home, he was quivering, he wasn’t right. We thought he’d tied up and treated him but he got rapidly worse.”  Mr Cramp took Dermot to his practice, where blood tests confirmed atypical myopathy and despite the vets’ best efforts, he had to be put down. Mr Cramp said the toxin is water-soluble, so the standing water from this wet spring has exacerbated the situation to a “perfect storm”. He added that the other horses kept in the same field were tested and had levels of the toxin but did not become ill.  “That tells us that some are susceptible and some aren’t,” he said. “They have to convert the toxin and none of them had done that.”  Mr Cramp advises spraying fields, and blood-testing horses who may have ingested seeds or seedlings.  “If the horse has the toxin, it needs to come out of the field, and be rested,” he said. “Exercise brings out the disease as the toxin inhibits ATP, the cells’ fuel, so the muscles run out of energy. There are things you can do to reduce the impact but rest is very important.”  Horse owner Amelia Shaw has started a petition calling for landowners to have an automatic right to fell sycamore trees on their land even if restrictions related to conservation areas or tree protection orders (TPO) apply.  Sign the petition  She told H&H she did get permission to fell a sycamore that was subject to a TPO on her land in 2016, but “it was a bit of a nightmare”.  “The whole process was difficult,” she said. “We were refused by the council but won on appeal. I was still at university so had time to do it but the condition is so prevalent this year and I’ve heard lots of people saying they want to fell trees but they’re protected. So I wanted to raise awareness, and also see if I could get support. It’s absolutely awful this year, we’ll be lucky if there are any horses left.”  BEVA is urging farmers cutting fields for hay to identify those at risk; not just those with sycamores nearby as the seeds can travel hundreds of metres, and avoid selling this hay to horse owners.  President David Rendle said: “By raising awareness of the risks of contaminated hay being fed to horses BEVA is hoping farmers will be able to identify any sycamore saplings within the crop while the grass length enables them to be seen. Sheep and cattle can also be affected by the toxin at very high levels but ruminants are more resistant to the toxin than horses. We are urging farmers to check their fields now and to discuss the risks from sycamores with their local equine veterinary practice if they need any further advice.”  You might also be interested in:  Horse & Hound magazine, out every Thursday, is packed with all the latest news and reports, as well as interviews, specials, nostalgia, vet and training advice.

"explosion","2023-01-01","Not Discerned","{""GreenBay"", ""Wisconsin"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 21:00:43","The Packers could have 'one of most explosive offenses in NFL' very soon, one NFL analyst says  Can the Green Bay Packers return to being one of the best offenses in the NFL with Jordan Love at quarterback and a young wide receiving cast?  One NFL analyst believes so.  ""Over the next season and over the next couple of years, this could be one of the most explosive offenses in the NFL and I think it has unlimited upside,"" Louis Riddick said during a recent appearance on ESPN's ""NFL Live.""  It's only been three years since the Packers had the No. 1-ranked scoring offense in the league and, with Aaron Rodgers at quarterback, they had a top-10 offense in 10 of the last 15 seasons.  Three years later, nearly everything has changed.  Love will be the quarterback. The wide receiver room has completely turned over with all first and second-year players led by Christian Watson and Romeo Doubs teaming with rookies Jayden Reed and Dontayvion Wicks. And the tight end position will be anchored by rookies Luke Musgrave and Tucker Kraft.  ""You have to take it slow and be willing to live with the bumps in the road,"" said Riddick, a former NFL player, scout and member of two front offices. ""You have to give them some time.""  What is a successful season for Jordan Love and the Packers in 2023?  Riddick's fellow panelist, Keyshawn Johnson, a former NFL wide receiver, gave a simple response when asked how success will be defined for Love in Year 1 as the starter.  ""Well, don't screw it up,"" Johnson said bluntly.  Johnson added that if Love can get the Packers to the eight-win mark — the Packers' total last season — or a little better, and show Packers management that he has improved, it'll be a successful season. Of note, the Packers' offense in 2022 with Rodgers playing every game dropped out of the top 10 in scoring, ranking 14th and their 21.8 points average was 10 points fewer than their league-high 2020 season. And in Rodgers' first season as the starter in 2008 the Packers finished 6-10 a year after going 13-3.  ""Show us that you've evolved since sitting on the bench,"" Johnson said. ""Show us what the Green Bay Packers saw in practice and what little bit of game play that you've had, that you've learned from it, that you've gotten better. I think he'll be successful. I understand he can't be Aaron Rodgers off the bat.""  Riddick explained the Packers should lean on what he called one of the best offensive lines and running back tandems in the NFL. Even so, managing expectations will be critical for Matt LaFleur and his coaching staff with so much inexperience across the offense.  Christian Watson, who is entering his second season, will lead a young Green Bay Packers wide receiving room in 2023.  Do the Packers need to sign a veteran wide receiver?  So, given the lack of NFL experience of the receivers, should the Packers add a veteran wideout? Johnson doesn't view that as a necessity.  ""I think you can expect them to be the core,"" he said. ""As long as you have a veteran wide receiver coach and a veteran offensive playcaller, they'll be fine.""  Jason Vrable enters his fifth season with the Packers and second as the wide receivers/passing game coordinator. He served as the wide receivers coach for two years before that and was an offensive assistant for one season. He came to the Packers with six years of NFL coaching experience.  Adam Stenavich is in his second year as offensive coordinator but LaFleur is the playcaller.  ""A lot of people look at it the wrong way,"" Johnson said of needing veterans. ""I understand it was Aaron Rodgers and there were high hopes in Green Bay. But you have to give them the opportunity and chance.""

(WSMV) - Looking at the photos of her daughter’s 2016 Kia Soul burned beyond recognition, Kim Kaiser wipes away tears.  “They’re hard to look at,” Kaiser said. “Just how close my kids were to getting hurt.”  Kaiser’s oldest daughter was behind the wheel on Briley Parkway on March 27, her youngest in the passenger seat, when something unexpected happened. “The gas, as she went to press on it, stopped accelerating,” Kaiser said.  Moments later, Kaiser’s daughter pulled over, and she and her sister noticed smoke coming out of the vents.  “It was just minutes of getting out of the car that it was engulfed in flames,” Kaiser said.  Kim Kaiser's two teenager daughters were in the car when the car began to cease accelerating. Moments later, it caught on fire. (Kim Kaiser)  Fire happened on Briley Parkway on March 27, 2023 (Kim Kaiser)  Dominque Willis’ experience driving his fiancé's 2015 Kia Soul before it burst into flames is strikingly similar.  Willis was also driving on Briley Parkway on Dec. 29, 2022, when he too had to pull over. “I kind of noticed the car wasn’t accelerating like it normally would,” Willis said.  As he pulled over and tried to restart the car, Willis said a woman drove in front of him and yelled for him to exit the car, as flames were underneath.  In a video he recorded moments later, Willis can be heard screaming, asking why the car was on fire. He then called his fiancé, Kanesha Horsley.  “He’s like, I don’t know, I can’t explain it. The cart is on fire,” Horsley said.  Another video, obtained by WSMV4 Investigates, captured on September 2021 on Vietnam Veterans Parkway, shows a KIA Sorento engulfed in flames. Its driver recorded as firefighters showed up to extinguish the flames.  WSMV4 Investigates has now documented five instances in which drivers were behind the wheel and their KIA vehicles caught on fire.  To further complicate the problem, in certain years, KIA Souls and Sorentos were recalled for the potential of a car fire.  But in each of the five cases documented by WSMV4 Investigates, the vin numbers on these specific cars were not identified as being part of a recall.  In fact, Horsley said she got a recall in the mail for all KIA Souls of her year and make, took it into a dealership, only to be told that her vin number indicated that it wasn’t part of the recall. “I was just thinking, I can keep driving it, it’s fine,” Horsley said.  Insurance claim data shows more fires in other vehicles  A review of insurance claim data shows a wide swath of vehicles currently not under recall still catching fire.  The data is only for claims about vehicles that caught on fire but were not involved in accidents, like the KIA vehicles documented by WSMV4 Investigates.  The data, at a cursory level, shows the models, makes and years of the vehicles with the highest rates of non-crash fires.  There are so many cases of fires in other makes and models, the KIA Soul and Sorento don’t even make the top ten.  Matt Moore, senior vice president of the Highway Loss Data Institute, said the data is presented to NHTSA for their review in determining recalls.  “It’s difficult to know if these fires were the result of a defect or something that happened over the life of the vehicle,” Moore said.  The data shows, overwhelmingly, the claims on non-crash car fires happen in older vehicles.  “Is that the reality? That an older car is more likely to catch on fire?” WSMV4 Investigates asked.  “That’s the reality. It’s not likely to catch on fire. It’s more likely to catch on fire than a new vehicle,” Moore said.  Once again, WSMV4 Investigates reached out to KIA Corporate for an explanation of why the vehicles now showing as part of the fire recall are still catching on fire, but a spokesman just asked for the vin numbers of the vehicles to investigate further.  The spokesman did write that there are many potential causes of vehicle fires, so these investigations on the vehicles are important to begin.  “When my children see them going down the road in the cars, we want to stop them and say, sell your car, get a different car,” Kaiser said.

"explosion","2023-10-17","Not Discerned","{""WestPalmBeach"", ""Florida"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 17:30:25","Bad news, space explosion fans: Betelgeuse is behaving strangely again, but it’s probably not about to explode.  Betelgeuse, the red giant best known for its starring role as the right shoulder of the constellation Orion, has brightened dramatically over the past few weeks. The star is about 50 percent brighter than usual, which has fueled a fresh wave of rumors that Betelgeuse might be on the brink of a supernova.  But astrophysicist Andrea Dupree says we shouldn’t worry — or get our hopes up. Instead, this latest strangeness from Betelgeuse is actually a sign that the star is getting back to normal.  “The star WILL go supernova,” Dupree tells Inverse, “but not in our lifetimes.”  “Where’s the Kaboom?”  This image tracks the Surface Mass Ejection that caused Betelgeuse’s infamous Great Dimming. NASA  At the moment, nuclear reactions deep in Betelgeuse’s core are busily smashing helium atoms together to form carbon atoms. When the star runs out of helium, a new set of reactions will start fusing carbon into oxygen.  Only after all the oxygen has become silicon, and all the silicon has become iron, will Betelgeuse finally run out of fuel to power the nuclear reactions that keep the star inflated against the tremendous force of its own gravity. At that point, it will collapse under its own gargantuan mass, triggering one of the most powerful explosions in the universe: a supernova.  Astronomers and skywatchers have been keeping a close eye on Betelgeuse since 2019, when its usual reddish glow faded dramatically. The Great Dimming, as it came to be called, continued through 2020 — and so did the supernova speculation. Dupree and her colleagues concluded that the dimming was part of the giant star’s normal restless activity.  Essentially, Betelgeuse belched out a cloud of gas and dust into space from an inner layer called the photosphere, which left a cool, dark patch on its southern hemisphere (which happens to be the hemisphere that’s facing Earth). Our own Sun does something similar, called a coronal mass ejection, fairly often; the only difference is that Betelgeuse’s ejection came from deeper inside the star.  Betelgeuse has always been prone to fluctuations; ancient historical records and oral histories say the star brightened and dimmed on a regular cycle, and that's continued through modern times. That cycle has been a fairly regular 420 days — up until the Great Dimming. Since then, Betelgeuse has been erratic at best. Betelgeuse’s recent brightening may be part of the star’s attempt to regain its equilibrium after its great stellar burp.  “The surface and interior of the star are trying to get back to normal after the substantial Surface Mass Ejection,” says Dupree. “Think of it as like your washing machine going off on ‘imbalance’ and sloshing around trying to get back to 'normal.’”  In other words, we can probably expect to see a few more rounds of sudden brightening and dimming from Betelgeuse before it settles back into more predictable behavior.  “Our theoretical calculations suggest that the 400-day period should return in a year or two, but Betelgeuse may surprise us,” Dupree says.  Apocalypse When?  But the real surprise would be if Betelgeuse actually went supernova within our lifetimes — or the lifetimes of the next several generations of humans. If Betelgeuse, or another red giant star, really is about to explode, it will give us some warning in the form of drastic changes that will make the Great Dimming look like nothing but a brief flicker. The star should darken abruptly, getting about 100 times dimmer in a matter of weeks or months, as it shrugs off its outer layers entirely.  When the big moment finally comes, Betelgeuse will abruptly transform from a very recognizable bright red star in the constellation Orion to a blaze of light about half as bright as a full Moon, visible even in the daytime. As the star is 650 light years away, future Earthlings will be able to observe the supernova from a safe distance, but close enough for astronomers to gather incredible data on the death of a giant star. It will be a once-in-several-thousand-lifetimes astronomical event.  Betelgeuse will get there eventually. Just give it 10,000 years or so.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVyc2UuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYmV0ZWxnZXVzZS1pcy10YXVudGluZy11cy1hZ2Fpbi1idXQtc3RpbGwtbm90LWV4cGxvZGluZ9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Regulators have closed their investigation into these explosions, but people who have experienced this told Channel 2 consumer investigator Justin Gray that it sounds and feels like an explosion in their vehicles.  Auto safety advocates say that really puts drivers at risk of an accident.  Kate Holder said she had to pull over after hearing what she can only describe as an explosion while driving her brand-new Jeep Wagoneer to work.  “I was going 55 miles an hour, then all of a sudden, like, literally an explosion,” Holder said.  [HAVE A STORY FOR 2 INVESTIGATES?: Submit your tip here]  Then she got out of the car.  “I just stood up on the rail. Got up and saw the big hole,” Holder said.  “Truly spontaneous?” Gray asked Holder.  “Yes, the most bizarre thing ever,” she said.  But when Channel 2 Action News checked with federal regulators, we found spontaneous breakage of panoramic sunroofs have been happening with a variety of makes and model vehicles for years.  So much so that The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration launched a 7-year investigation finding, “spontaneous sunroof glass shattering is not an uncommon occurrence: More than 4,000 complaints of such occurrences were reported by the 13 manufacturers”  MORE STORIES FROM 2 INVESTIGATES:  Gray checked the NHTSA complaint database as recently as last week.  The driver of a Ford Edge wrote, “I was driving down the road when out of nowhere my sunroof started raining glass in the inside of my car!! There was no Crack or stone that hit it nothing!!”  “That type of distraction while you’re driving, you know, you’ve got tempered glass chunks all over you and you don’t know what just happened. I think any reasonable person can see that that could pose a pretty serious distraction risk,” said Michael Brooks, executive director of The Center for Auto Safety.  But in 2021, NHTSA closed its investigation into panoramic sunroofs without ever determining what’s causing them to spontaneously explode, writing it “has not identified sufficient evidence of a safety-related defect in the subject sunroof.”  “What if the glass got into my baby’s eyes, or face, or even the car seat?” Holder asked.  She told Gray that she’s just thankful she had the cover closed on the sunroof.  “Now, I don’t want to open up the sunroof … just in case,” Holder said.  NHTSA said there have been about a dozen reported minor injuries, most from cleaning up the glass.  Gray checked with NHTSA before his report on Wednesday to see if there have been any updates.

The tech world has been enamored with a new generation of chatbots since OpenAI's ChatGPT went viral late last year. That's pressured companies like Amazon to showcase their own capabilities in generative AI. Amazon's biggest entry into the market thus far has been through an AI service for cloud customers.  However, Rohit Prasad, Amazon's senior vice president and head scientist for Alexa, said it's wrong to think the e-retailer has missed out in generative AI, which allows people to convert text-based queries into creative and thorough answers.  ""Alexa has been and is at the forefront of AI for a long time,"" Prasad told CNBC in an interview. ""We've been part of the cultural zeitgeist and it hasn't slowed down.""  Prasad added that contrary to ChatGPT, which remains accessible through a web browser, Alexa is an ""instantly available, personal AI"" that people can communicate with by voice.  Amazon established an early lead in voice software after it debuted its Alexa digital assistant in 2014. More than 500 million Alexa-powered devices have been sold worldwide, the company said Wednesday. The last time Amazon gave an update on that number was in 2019, when it was at 100 million.  The Alexa assistant, now plugged into everything from smart speakers to thermostats, has long depended on machine learning technology to answer their queries by fetching relevant data.  But the rise of AI-powered chatbots, which can perform sophisticated functions like writing fiction and coding software, has highlighted the limitations of digital assistants such as Alexa. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' sci-fi vision for Alexa to resemble an all-knowing computer from ""Star Trek"" hasn't exactly panned out.  Prasad said Amazon is working to make Alexa more conversational and intelligent. One way it hopes to do so is through a new version of its own large language model, called Alexa Teacher Model. Large language models power generative AI, and Alexa is already powered by Amazon's LLM.  The goal is for Alexa to be able to answer complex requests, and understand more about users.  ""This is where all the ambient context of who you are, what are you asking, where you are, comes in to make the best decision for you in that moment and on your behalf,"" Prasad said.  In his latest letter to investors, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said generative AI and LLMs are areas where the company is ""investing heavily,"" noting that the technologies stand to ""transform and improve virtually every customer experience.""  The company has posted job listings suggesting it plans to implement a ChatGPT-style product in search on its online store, Bloomberg reported. Amazon may also add more generative AI-like features to Alexa focused on entertainment and storytelling, according to Insider.

Ms Linda Gallagher said she was the beneficiary of the last will and testament, dated November 30, 2006 of the late Mr Kelly, which included a house, car and out office on lands known as Bishops Island at Castledoe, Creeslough, together with the residue of his estate.  An affidavit from Ms Gallagher said that she attended the property in question on October 15, 2022 and discovered that the deceased’s nephew, Mr Josie Kelly, had ‘wrongfully or illegally entered the dwelling and changed the locks’.  Ms Gallagher, who was represented by Mr Gareth McGrory BL, instructed by solicitor Mr Frank Dorian, alleged that Mr Josie Kelly had unlawfully and wrongfully trespassed and accessed the dwelling house and had also placed padlocks on the gates and placed a donkey on the lands.  The court heard that the late Mr Hugh Kelly had resided at the property - which was described as being a ‘traditional farmhouse with extension and outbuildings’ - all of his life. The court was told that the property was registered in Mr Hugh Kelly’s name having previously been in the name of his mother, Ms Sally Kelly,.  Ms Gallagher sought an injunction to restrain the defendant, his servants or agents from trespassing, entering or making use of the lands without the express authority of the plaintiff.  Mr McGrory said his client was also seeking an injunction to have the defendant, his servants or agents to repair any damage caused following the alleged illegal trespass.  Ms Gallagher is originally from Indiana in the United States and had been in a ‘loving relationship’ with the late Mr Kelly, although they maintained separate houses.  She said she was ‘completely distraught’ on learning of the explosion and the death of Hugh Kelly and the other nine victims of the tragedy.  She described the ‘shock, pain and sorrow’ she suffered in the immediate aftermath of the explosion.  Ms Gallagher said she went to America in late October and when she returned in November she found the gates were chained and padlocked and a donkey was present on the lands.  She told the court that she has sentimental property in the house, including photographs.  In an affidavit, Mr Josie Kelly, who was represented in court by barrister Mr John McCoy BL, said his late grandfather had wished the property to stay in the Kelly family. Mr Josie Kelly said he had invested over €100,000 on improvements to the property and had organised crops of hay and silage on the farmland.  He said he had lived at the property since 1984, save for the years of his marriage until 2018, since which he had been living on the property.  Mr Kelly claimed that none of the plaintiff’s possessions are in the house and that he always had a key and access to the house.  “The property is my home,” he said.  Judge John Aylmer asked why Mr Josie Kelly had not exhibited anything in support of his evidence.  “The absence is striking,” he said, noting that he expected to see evidence that he has been living there since 2018 and of the €100,000 he said he had spent.  Mr McCoy said he would take the matter back to his client for further instruction and said there were ‘parallel proceedings’ before the High Court.  Judge Aylmer said he was giving a short opportunity for the defendant to put evidence before the court ‘that one would expect to support a contention that he has been living there since 2019’.  The matter was adjourned until Carrick-On-Shannon Circuit Court on Thursday-week, May 25, with both deponents to be present.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRvbmVnYWxsaXZlLmllL25ld3MvZG9uZWdhbGxpdmUvMTE3MjgyOS9wYXJ0bmVyLW9mLWNyZWVzbG91Z2gtZXhwbG9zaW9uLXZpY3RpbS1zZWVrcy1pbmp1bmN0aW9uLW92ZXItcHJvcGVydHkuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

London Fire Brigade crews were called to the incident at the weekend on Cecil Road, Harlesden in Brent. Dell Williams (37) is one of the tenants in the two-storey terraced house and was charging his e-scooter in the kitchen of the property when the fire occurred. Luckily for him, and the other residents, they were not nearby when the incident occurred.  The CCTV footage, captured on two cameras in the hallway and in the kitchen of the property shared by the letting agent, shows how quickly the e-scooter caught alight. Dell attempts to tackle the fire with a fire blanket but is overcome by fumes and exits the property.  Security guard Dell bought the e-scooter a fortnight ago from the online marketplace Gumtree, to help him travel around London. He says he was charging the e-scooter in the communal kitchen instead of his room to avoid his dog touching it while it charged.  I'm grateful to be alive  Dell said: “I just want to thank the Lord that we managed to get out of there in one piece! I am so grateful to be alive. I spent eight hours in hospital due to inhaling smoke from the fire and when I went back to the house it was such an eye opener. I was shocked, I am shocked now. I am so grateful that no one else was hurt. I cheated death.”  Thermal runaway can lead to a ferocious fire  London Fire Brigade’s Deputy Commissioner, Dom Ellis, explains while this type of incident is frightening, sadly it is getting more common. Dom said: “As the video shows, once a battery starts to go into thermal runaway a fire develops very quickly and can block escape routes.  “Thermal runaway can lead to the destruction of the battery and a ferocious fire.  “We know prior to ignition thermal runaway can lead to the ejection of a range of gases. The white and grey coloured smoke is not harmless, and the speed at which these incidents develop shouldn’t be ignored.  “Please follow our #ChargeSafe advice and never tackle a fire: get out, stay out and dial 999.”  Don't leave them on charge unattended  Dell wants to advise others who are thinking about purchasing an e-scooter about how to keep safe, he said: “Don’t have e-scooters in the house, charge outside, don’t keep it in the house. Buy e-scooters from a shop where you have a warranty and insurance. These things happen, I wouldn’t say don’t buy one, but if you buy one store them outside so they don’t catch fire. Don’t leave them on charge unattended. Keep people and property safe!”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sb25kb24tZmlyZS5nb3YudWsvbmV3cy8yMDIzL21heS9icmlnYWRlLXNoYXJlcy1mcmlnaHRlbmluZy1mb290YWdlLW9mLWUtc2Nvb3Rlci1iYXR0ZXJ5LWV4cGxvc2lvbi13aXRoLWNoYXJnZXNhZmUtcGxlYS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"explosion","1945-08-06","Not Discerned","{""Hiroshima"", ""Hiroshima"", ""Japan""}","Wed 17 May 2023 17:23:23","Every bit of matter in the universe holds a ton of energy. Einstein's equation, E=MC^2, posits that mass and energy are the same thing but in different forms. And a tiny amount of mass represents a massive amount of energy. So much energy that the atomic weapons used against Japan and the nuclear weapons stockpiled around the world only have to convert a tiny amount of matter into energy to have devastating effects. How tiny? A butterfly's worth.  The Hiroshima bomb  The first atomic weapon launched in anger was the one dropped by the Enola Gay on Hiroshima, Japan on August 6, 1945. The bomb was massive, weighing approximately 9,700 pounds in an age when most bombs weighed less than 4,000. But Little Boy, as the bomb was called, used an inefficient ""gun-type"" design.  A very small amount of matter actually turned into energy. The weapon contained 141 pounds of uranium, about two pounds of it fissioned, and that converted about a gram of it into energy. That little uranium created a 15-kiloton explosion that killed nine out of 10 people within a half mile of the bomb, instantly ignited hundreds or thousands of fires that created a massive firestorm, and flattened buildings and broke windows.  An aerial photo of Hiroshima showing the destruction caused the atomic bomb on Aug. 6, 1945. The photo was in possession of Ralph Richard Hayes, former 20th Air Force, Army Air Corps, 421st Bombardment Squadron bombardier, who served during World War II in Japan. On Aug. 6, 1945, the B-29, Enola Gay, flew over Hiroshima and dropped the first atomic bomb. (Courtesy Photo)  The Nagasaki bomb  Just a few days later, on August 9, America dropped a second atomic bomb on Japan. The ""Fat Man"" bomb dropped by Bock's Car created a 21 kiloton explosion, 40% larger than the Hiroshima blast. It affected 43 square miles with blast, heat, and radiation, flattening even some earthquake-hardened structures and 14,000 homes.  The pit in the Fat Man bomb was much smaller, at 13.6 pounds, but made of plutonium which is more efficient. About 2.2 pounds of plutonium fissioned. That's the weight of a bocce ball. And even less matter was converted than underwent fission.  A B-29 Superfortress painted to commemorate “The Great Artiste”, a silverplate B-29 with the 509th Composite Group, sits as a static display on August 6, 2019, at the Spirit Gate at Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri. The Great Artiste participated in both the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki 74 years prior, providing weather and documentation of the bombings. The aircraft was lost in a crash landing in 1949 in Labrador, Canada. (U.S. Air Force photo by Airman 1st Class Parker J. McCauley)  Bikini Atoll  The Castle Bravo shot at Bikini Atoll in 1954 is the largest thermonuclear explosion ever conducted by the United States. The huge explosion was, in part, a mistake. It was the first test of a ""dry"" thermonuclear device, and designers drastically underestimated how much lithium would increase the efficiency of the weapon.  About a quarter of the weapon's 880 pounds of lithium-6 deuteride underwent fission or fusion. This resulted in a 15-megaton explosion 1,000 times stronger than the explosion at Hiroshima. It also created the largest nuclear contamination incident in U.S. history, exposing hundreds of Pacific islanders and U.S. service members to high levels of radiation.  The Tsar Bomba  The Soviet RDS-220, known in the U.S. as the Tsar Bomba, was the largest nuclear device ever detonated. On October 30, 1961, the Soviets detonated a version with a 50-megaton result. This damaged buildings over 100 miles away and a test witness 170 miles away reported feeling the thermal blast. It created a seismic event that completed three revolutions around the Earth. Insanely, this was the muted version of the Tsar Bomba, with a lead tamper instead of a uranium one. The uranium version is thought to have a 100-megaton yield.  According to an East Tennessee State University lesson supplement, the energy released by Tsar Bomba represented about 5 pounds of matter converting to energy. Those five pounds created a mushroom cloud that rose over 40 miles into the air, seven times higher than Mount Everest.  The continent cracker  Scientists at Livermore Laboratory once proposed an insane double-thermonuclear weapon. Gnomon would create a 1,000-megaton explosion and trigger Sundial which boasted a 10,000-megaton yield, if the scientists' predictions were right.  It's important to note two things: 1) The assembled scientists from other labs immediately laughed it down, and 2) These were the folks whose last three designs had failed.  But if their designs had worked, it would require an approximately 25-ton design, blow a hole in the atmosphere, and instantly burn an area about the size of France. But it would only need to convert about 100 pounds of matter into energy in the first stage and 1,000 pounds in the second stage to achieve the result.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndlYXJldGhlbWlnaHR5LmNvbS9oaXN0b3J5L2hvdy1tdWNoLW1hc3MtaXMtZGVzdHJveWVkLWluLWEtbnVjbGVhci13ZWFwb25zLWV4cGxvc2lvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"explosion","2018-05-18","10:15:00","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 09:44:33","The last super-eruption at Yellowstone volcano, which occurred 631,000 years ago, was not one huge explosion. Instead, new research suggests it was a series of eruptions or multiple vents spewing volcanic material in rapid succession.  According to the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) Yellowstone Volcano Observatory 2022 Annual Report (opens in new tab), published May 4, fieldwork over the past year has provided new geological evidence that ""the formation of Yellowstone Caldera was much more complex than previously thought."" A caldera is a large crater that forms after the collapse of a volcano following an eruption.  Yellowstone is one of the world's biggest volcanic systems. It sits above one of Earth's ""hotspots"" — areas in the mantle where hot plumes rise and form volcanoes on the crust above. It has produced three caldera-forming eruptions (opens in new tab) in the past 3 million years: the Huckleberry Ridge Tuff eruption, 2.1 million years ago; the Mesa Falls eruption, 1.3 million years ago; and the Lava Creek eruption, 631,000 years ago.  What are super-eruptions?  The Huckleberry Ridge Tuff and Lava Creek events are considered super-eruptions because they expelled over 240 cubic miles (1,000 cubic kilometers) of material. The latter was responsible for the formation of the Yellowstone caldera. Mesa Falls erupted 67 cubic m (280 cubic km) of material, so — while still about 10 times bigger than the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens — is not considered a super-eruption.  Related: Where are most of Earth's volcanoes?  Previous research (opens in new tab) has shown that the Lava Creek super-eruption was not out of the blue; deposits at the Sour Creek Dome region east of the national park suggest that the giant blast was preceded by at least one eruption. Ignimbrite (volcanic rock formed via the deposits of the hot mix of material ejected during an eruption) found at the site had completely cooled before the main, mapped Lava Creek eruption took place.  Researchers have found evidence that there were multiple explosive events during the last super-eruption at Yellowstone. (Image credit: Noppawat Tom Charoensinphon/Getty Images)  To better understand the timeline of the eruption, scientists spent 2022 remapping and collecting samples at Sour Creek Dome.  ""It had always been known that there were at least two geological units [a volume of rock distinct from those surrounding it] from the eruption, and it was thought that there was little to no time gap between them,"" Michael Poland (opens in new tab), scientist-in-charge at the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory, told Live Science in an email. ""Now, we think there are more units. And we're just not sure what the time gap might have been, if any.""  So far, the team has found four previously unrecognized ignimbrite units at Sour Creek, suggesting at least four eruptive pulses. They also found two structures that appear to be eruptive vents, which may have been the sources of these rocks.  ""That could mean either several vents were active and/or there was time separation between the eruptions,"" Poland said. ""But we don't yet have the data we need to answer those questions yet.""  In 2020, scientists found the Huckleberry Ridge Tuff eruption (opens in new tab) — which ejected more than twice the amount of volcanic material as Lava Creek did — was also a phased event. Analysis of rocks at the site suggests there were three separate eruptions, with weeks to months between the first two, and years to decades between the second and third.  Yellowstone volcano is not expected to erupt anytime soon . However, the finding that the Lava Creek eruption may have followed a similar pattern to that of the Huckleberry Ridge Tuff eruption could give an idea of what to expect if and when Yellowstone does blow. ""These major caldera-forming eruptions might not be single events at Yellowstone, but instead have multiple phases,"" Poland said.  Researchers at the volcano now plan to carry out detailed examinations of the newly discovered units and the boundaries between them. This will allow them to paint a more detailed picture of what the Lava Creek eruption looked like — and maybe even what triggered it.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlc2NpZW5jZS5jb20vcGxhbmV0LWVhcnRoL3ZvbGNhbm9zL3llbGxvd3N0b25lLXZvbGNhbm8tc3VwZXItZXJ1cHRpb25zLWFwcGVhci10by1pbnZvbHZlLW11bHRpcGxlLWV4cGxvc2l2ZS1ldmVudHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

One person died and two were wounded by a Russian missile that got through and struck an industrial building in the southern region of Odesa, according to Serhiy Bratchuk, a spokesperson for the region's military administration.  Amid the recently intensified Russian air assaults, China said its special envoy met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during talks in Kyiv earlier this week with Ukraine's chief diplomat.  Beijing's peace proposal has so far yielded no apparent breakthrough in the war, and Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said Thursday that the warring parties needed to “accumulate mutual trust” for progress to be made.  Ukrainian officials sought during the talks to recruit China’s support for Kyiv’s own peace plan, according to Ukraine’s presidential office. Zelenskyy’s proposal includes the restoration of his country's territorial integrity, the withdrawal of Russian forces and holding Russian President Vladimir Putin legally accountable for the invasion in February 2022.  Meanwhile, Kremlin-installed authorities in occupied Crimea reported the derailment of eight train cars Thursday because of an explosion, prompting renewed suspicions about possible Ukrainian saboteur activity behind Russian lines. Russian state media reported that the train was carrying grain.  The state news agency RIA Novosti, quoting a source within the emergency services, said the incident occurred not far from the city of Simferopol. The Crimean Railway company said the derailment was caused by “the interference of unauthorized persons” and that there were no casualties.  Ukraine officials refuse to comment on possible acts of sabotage. Ukraine’s military intelligence spokesperson, Andriy Yusov, noted on Ukrainian television that Russian train lines “are also used to transport weapons, ammunition, armored vehicles.”  Overnight, loud explosions were heard in Kyiv as the Kremlin’s forces targeted the capital for the ninth time this month in a clear escalation after weeks of lull and before a much-anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive using newly supplied advanced Western weapons.  Debris fell on two Kyiv districts, starting a fire at a garage complex. There was no immediate word about any victims, Serhii Popko, head of the Kyiv Military Administration, said in a Telegram post.  Ukraine also shot down two Russian exploding drones and two reconnaissance drones, according to authorities.  The missiles were launched from Russian sea, air and ground bases, General Valerii Zaluzhnyi, the Ukrainian commander in chief, wrote on Telegram.  Several waves of missiles were aimed at areas of Ukraine between 9 p.m. Wednesday and 5:30 a.m. Thursday, he said.  Russian forces used strategic bombers from the Caspian region and apparently fired X-101 and X-55-type missiles developed during Soviet times, Kyiv authorities said. Russia then deployed reconnaissance drones over the capital.  In the last major air attack on Kyiv, on Tuesday, Ukrainian air defenses bolstered by sophisticated Western-supplied systems shot down all the incoming missiles, officials said.  That attack used hypersonic missiles, which repeatedly have been touted by Putin as providing a key strategic advantage. The missiles, which are among the most advanced weapons in Russia's arsenal, are difficult to detect and intercept because of their hypersonic speed and maneuverability.  But sophisticated Western air defense systems, including American-made Patriot missiles, have helped spare Kyiv from the kind of destruction witnessed along the main front line in the country’s east and south.  While the ground fighting is largely deadlocked along that front line, both sides are targeting each other's territory with long-range weapons.  The most intense fighting has focused on the battle for the city of Bakhmut and the surrounding area, in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk province, with a Ukrainian military official claiming Thursday that the army advanced up to 1.7 kilometers (more than a mile) there over the previous day.  At the same time, Yevgeny Prigozhin, the millionaire owner of Russia’s private military contractor Wagner whose troops have spearheaded the battle, claimed that Russian army units had retreated from their positions north of the city. Prigozhin is a frequent critic of the Russian military.  At least seven Ukrainian civilians were killed, including a 5-year-old boy, and 18 people were wounded over the previous 24 hours, the presidential office said.  Also, two people were wounded in a drone attack in Russia’s southern Kursk region, which borders Ukraine, the regional governor reported Thursday.  In a Telegram post, Roman Starovoit claimed Ukrainian forces dropped an explosive device from a drone on a sports and recreation complex.  ___  Yuras Karmanau contributed to this report from Tallinn, Estonia.  ___  Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine  ×  ×  ×  ×  ×  ×  ×  ×  ×","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR1cmFuZ29oZXJhbGQuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL2xvdWQtZXhwbG9zaW9ucy1oZWFyZC1pbi1reWl2LWRlYnJpcy1jYXVzZXMtYnVpbGRpbmctZmlyZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

It’s Tuesday, May 9 between 11 a.m. and 11:45 a.m.  There’s a lunch party of 20 at the Red Rooster and it’s being watched over by three Wagoner High School seniors while the boss is out of the restaurant temporarily.  Miranda’s Bakery and Café is selling items and getting ready for the lunch crowd.  An employee of BancFirst has arrived at the east parking lot to pick up someone to go to lunch.  The Locker Room is working on orders in the back.  Wagoner County Clerk Lori Hendricks is in her first floor office facing East Cherokee Street.  Seth Yoder from Edward Jones was driving on Cherokee Street to the office.  One of the Smokin’ Sisters employees was standing behind the bar, but is still making sure that the two Highway Patrolmen are getting their lunch order in fine fashion.  Then, it HITS!  An explosion rocks a major portion of downtown Wagoner.  Once the shock wore off, people came out of their businesses and looked around.  Hendricks looked out the window and saw some kind of large black canister-looking item in the westbound lane.  The parking spot at the BancFirst where someone was picked up for lunch has a small crater made by a round black piece of metal.  Other bits of debris fell even further south.  The Smokin’ Sisters employee nearly doubled over by the blast and noise. The Highway Patrolmen jumped up and left to see what they could do.  Miranda’s employees thought the stove had exploded.  Two of the Red Rooster assistants went out the back door to see what it was. Ironically, the party of 20 did not act like they had even heard it.  “We were all back in the kitchen when it happened and shook all the cups,” said Ashlee Jones.  “Alyssa (Langston) and Joci (Bryant) went out to see. I stayed inside.”  Langston also was caught off guard.  “It was pretty scary,” Langston said. “The whole building shook and it was a loud boom sound.”  Bryant said she thought it was part of some kind of construction.  Yoder was driving down the street and saw debris.  Wagoner Deputy Chief of Police, Tony Ponds, later told officials that the explosion came from just west of the railroad tracks and just south of West Cherokee at a recycling site.  A CNG bottle was being either crushed or recycled in some way without knowing there was something still in it or the release valve was still closed. It’s still not certain.  “It shook the window,” Hendricks said. “I saw it fall from the sky.”  Someone took the time to measure the distance from the debris that fell in the BancFirst parking lot from the recycle center – it measured a quarter of a mile!  There are probably many other reactions by other businesses, but the bottom line is: No one was hurt and there was no property damage, either.  Now, that’s a miracle.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3R1bHNhd29ybGQuY29tL25ld3MvY29tbXVuaXR5L3dhZ29uZXIvd2Fnb25lci1leHBsb3Npb24tc2VuZHMtZGVicmlzLWEtcXVhcnRlci1taWxlLWF3YXkvYXJ0aWNsZV85YWU1Y2JmNC1mMmYwLTExZWQtYTUyMC1hM2QzMDZjMTRjYjMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"explosion","2023-05-14","Not Discerned","{""Denver"", ""Colorado"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 19:18:37","Mother’s Day is the busiest day of the year for any bakery, apart from maybe Christmas.  But just 90 minutes before Ismael De Sousa opened Reunion Bread for business on Sunday, May 14, his bread oven exploded, sparking a large fire inside the bakery at The Source Hotel + Market Hall.  “Thank God no one got injured because it was massive,” De Sousa said. “The bread oven takes up three-quarters of the bakery, but no one was near the oven at the exact moment when it blew up and caught on fire.”  The Denver Fire Department arrived on the scene, as well as a line of shocked customers, but the fire, which De Sousa guessed was caused by a gas leak in the oven, was already out, so DFD helped fan out the remaining smoke.  De Sousa’s team was able to use the ovens at Bellota restaurant next door to save Mother’s Day, but many problems remained.  “It was still a big profit loss because we could only make bread out of that specific oven, and we could only make half of what we sell, like croissants, cookies and pastries,” De Sousa said. “We were running back and forth from the bakery to Bellota for six hours.”  For now, the 2023 James Beard Award semifinalist has temporarily closed the bakery at 3350 Brighton Blvd., but he hopes to reopen this weekend serving Portuguese and Venezuelan pastries, croissants and cookies baked in small convection ovens.  “I have to replace the bread oven, so we’re going to lose our bread business for a while,” De Sousa said. “That type of equipment in the U.S. is a lot of money, but it’s also four months out before I can order one, which will be an interesting few months.”  De Sousa hopes insurance will cover the cost of the bread oven before he has to consider starting a GoFundMe campaign. He wants customers to know that until the equipment is back and up running, the bakery’s product and quality might not be the exact same, since the oven is a crucial part of the baking process.  “When you come in, and there’s no bread, don’t get mad, just understand that something difficult has happened,” De Sousa said. “If you want to help, come buy a croissant or cup of coffee in the meantime.”  Subscribe to our new food newsletter, Stuffed, to get Denver food and drink news sent straight to your inbox.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbnZlcnBvc3QuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTcvcmV1bmlvbi1icmVhZC1maXJlLWV4cGxvc2lvbi1tb3RoZXJzLWRheS1zaHV0cy1iYWtlcnnSAWBodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZW52ZXJwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE3L3JldW5pb24tYnJlYWQtZmlyZS1leHBsb3Npb24tbW90aGVycy1kYXktc2h1dHMtYmFrZXJ5L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"explosion","2023-04-01","Not Discerned","{""BocaChica"", ""SantoDomingo"", ""DominicanRepublic""}","Wed 17 May 2023 10:00:25","On April 20, Elon Musk’s private space exploration company, SpaceX, launched its Starship spacecraft and Super Heavy rocket from Port Isabel, Texas. The launchpad exploded, and the craft, the largest spaceship launched, soared through the air for about four minutes before failing to detach from its booster and exploding over Boca Chica. Residents reported ash and dust coatings on their cars and windows.  This test run brings us another small step toward Mars, but how tests and incidents like this one will affect people’s health and well-being is still an unanswered question. Aerospace engineering professor Moriba Jah from The University of Texas at Austin tells Inverse that we should prepare for more explosions as SpaceX continues trial flights, and that means understanding potential health outcomes.  What did the SpaceX explosion do to the air?  In Port Isabel’s immediate vicinity, visible debris fell from the sky.  This visible matter remained close to the launchpad, but microscopic debris certainly spread farther. An explosion like this results in fine particulate matter (PM2.5, referring to particles that are less than two and a half microns wide), which can hang in the air for about two weeks, according to Sarah Chambliss, an environmental science postdoctoral fellow at the University of Texas Dell Medical School Center for Health & Environment: Education & Research. She says these invisible particles can cause some of the most deleterious air pollution.  “They're totally invisible,” Chambliss tells Inverse. “You don't even smell them.”  These particles travel far, too. If they’re picked up by the wind, they “can disperse across, basically, continental scale,” Chambliss tells Inverse. This is the same reason why the effects of a wildfire in California register all the way over in New York.  The explosion in the air was a medley of heavy metals and rocket fuel. Starship’s Raptor engine, in particular, runs on liquid oxygen and methane — and Starship had 34 engines. “Particulate matter that's high in metal content is more toxic,” Chambliss says.  Does this pollution impact our health?  Inhaling elevated levels of PM2.5, Chambliss says, is linked to inflammation, increased risk of an asthma emergency, increased incidence of asthma, and lung cancer. However, a single event like this can’t be fully responsible for health damage. “You wouldn’t be able to attribute any individual health outcome to an explosion like this,” Chambliss tells Inverse.  More immediately, this explosion harms our environment. Environmental organizations, including the Center for Biological Diversity, the American Bird Conservancy, the Surfrider Foundation, Save RGV, and the Carrizo/Comecrudo Nation of Texas, filed a suit against the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for the damages committed.  How can SpaceX prevent damage next time?  Highly accurate models that give a better idea of potential damage, Jah says, could demonstrate in computer simulations the likelihood of particular outcomes, such as explosions. Aerospace engineering employs these high-fidelity models in aircraft design, but Jah says they’re not yet part of standard practice. Especially when it comes to firsts, like the historically huge and powerful Starship, high-fidelity modeling is essential because learning from mistakes could be too costly.  “If it's all learning from trial and error, that is to the detriment of the environment,” he tells Inverse.  SpaceX has not made a public comment on the explosion’s impact on public health or our environment and did not respond to Inverse for comment in time for publication.  Following the explosion, the FAA has grounded SpaceX’s Starship rockets until it finds that “any system, process, or procedure related to the mishap does not affect public safety,” the FAA said in a statement.  “I do think that it's the ethical responsibility of polluters to deal with the fallout of their pollution,” Chambliss says.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVyc2UuY29tL2hlYWx0aC9zdGFyc2hpcC1leHBsb3Npb24taGVhbHRoLWhhemFyZC1mdXR1cmUtZXhwbG9zaW9ucy1iaWdnZXItcHJvYmxlbdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"explosion","2020-03-23","Not Discerned","{""Stockholm"", ""Stockholm"", ""Sweden""}","Thu 18 May 2023 04:56:14","When stars like our Sun die, they tend to go out with a whimper and not a bang – unless they happen to be part of a binary (two) star system that could give rise to a supernova explosion.  Now, for the first time, astronomers have spotted the radio signature of just such an event in a galaxy more than 400 million light-years away. The finding, published today in Nature, holds tantalizing clues as to what the companion star must have been like.  An explosive star death  As stars up to eight times heavier than our Sun start to run out of nuclear fuel in their core, they puff off their outer layers. This process gives rise to the colorful clouds of gas misleadingly known as planetary nebulae, and leaves behind a dense, compact hot core known as a white dwarf.  Our own Sun will undergo this transition in 5 billion years or so, then slowly cool and fade away. However, if a white dwarf somehow puts on weight, a self-destruct mechanism kicks in when it gets heavier than about 1.4 times the mass of our Sun.  The subsequent thermonuclear detonation destroys the star in a distinctive kind of explosion called a Type Ia supernova.  But where would the extra mass come from to fuel such a bang?  We used to think it could be gas being stripped off a bigger companion star in a close orbit. But stars tend to be messy eaters, spilling gas everywhere.  A supernova explosion would shock any spilt gas and make it glow at radio wavelengths. Despite decades of searching however, not a single young Type Ia supernova has ever been detected with radio telescopes.  Instead, we began to think Type Ia supernovae must be pairs of white dwarfs spiraling inwards and merging together in a relatively clean fashion, leaving no gas to shock – and no radio signal.  A rare type of supernova  Supernova 2020eyj was discovered by a telescope in Hawai'i on March 23 2020. For the first seven weeks or so it behaved in much the same way as any other Type Ia supernova.  But for the next five months, it stopped fading in brightness. Around the same time, it began to show features indicating gas that was unusually rich in helium.  We began to suspect Supernova 2020eyj belonged to a rare subclass of Type Ia supernovae in which the blast wave, moving at more than 10,000 kilometers per second, sweeps past gas that could only have been stripped off the outer layers of a surviving companion star.  To try to confirm our hunch, we decided to test if there was enough gas being shocked to produce a radio signal. As the supernova is too far north to observe with telescopes like the Australia Telescope Compact Array near Narrabri, we instead used an array of radio telescopes spread across the United Kingdom to observe the supernova about 20 months after the explosion.  To our great surprise, we had the first-ever clear detection of an ""infant"" Type Ia supernova at radio wavelengths, confirmed by a second observation some five months later. Could this be the ""smoking gun"" that not all Type Ia supernovae are caused by the merger of two white dwarfs?  frameborder=""0″ allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"" allowfullscreen>  Patience pays off  One of the more remarkable properties of Type Ia supernovae is that they all seem to reach pretty much the same peak brightness. This is consistent with them all having reached a similar critical mass before exploding.  This very attribute allowed astronomer Brian Schmidt and colleagues to reach their Nobel Prize-winning conclusion in the late 1990s: that the universe's expansion since the Big Bang is not slowing down under gravity (as everyone had expected), but is accelerating due to the effects of what we now call dark energy.  So, Type Ia supernovae are important cosmic objects, and the fact we still don't know exactly how and when these stellar explosions occur, or what makes them so consistent, has been a worry to astronomers.  In particular, if pairs of merging white dwarfs can range in total mass up to almost three times the mass of our Sun, why should they all release about the same amount of energy?  Our hypothesis (and radio confirmation) that Supernova 2020eyj occurred when enough helium gas was stripped off the companion star and onto the surface of the white dwarf to push it just over the mass limit, provides a natural explanation for this consistency.  The question now is why we haven't seen this radio signal before in any other Type Ia supernova. Perhaps we tried to detect them too soon after the explosion, and gave up too easily. Or maybe not all companion stars are as helium-rich and prodigious in shedding their gaseous outer layers.  But as our study has shown, patience and persistence sometimes pays off in ways we never expected, allowing us to hear the dying whispers of a distant star.

More than two dozen people were injured after an explosion in Tijuana, Mexico, a few miles south of the San Ysidro Port of Entry Tuesday morning, prompting a large response from rescuers from various local agencies.  The video shows an SUV approaching and a pair of pedestrians, one of whom appears to be using a cane, caught in the blast. After the shock wave hits, the people are down in the street, and one slowly struggles upright. The other never appears to awaken. The SUV slowly backs down the street as the dust settles, with debris now scattered across the street.  The boom shook the Blancas building in Tijuana's East Zone at around 9:35 a.m. The building houses a print shop, a furniture store, a car detailing shop and a spare parts store. Atop the businesses were apartments that were not meant to be inhabited, according to the Tijuana Civil Protection Agency.

After an hour and a half of work, firefighters were able to free one person who was trapped in the basement. The individual suffered first- and second-degree burns and was one of several transported to area hospitals, the agency said.  At least 25 people were injured, according to the Tijuana Fire Department — four with serious injuries, six in moderate condition and 15 with minor injuries.

These forthcoming rules hold immense potential for the crypto landscape, with several coins poised to benefit, including notable contenders such as $Lina, $ACH, $CFX, and $COCOS.  CFX is the native token of the CryptoFights platform, while COCOS is the native token of the Cocos-BCX blockchain. Both coins are based in China and have a significant Chinese user base.  CFX was launched in 2018 and is based on the Neo blockchain. It is a decentralized gaming platform that allows users to play games, earn rewards, and trade in-game items. COCOS was launched in 2019 and is based on the Ethereum blockchain. It is a decentralized gaming platform that focuses on blockchain-based games.  Both CFX and COCOS have been successful in attracting users and developers. CFX has a market capitalization of over $1 billion and COCOS has a market capitalization of over $500 million. Both coins are listed on major cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance and Huobi.  CFX and COCOS are both promising projects with the potential to disrupt the gaming industry.  SFC’s regulations are set to instill confidence in the crypto sector  Driven by a steadfast commitment to investor protection and market integrity, the SFC’s comprehensive and robust regulations are set to instill confidence in the crypto sector. By mandating VASPs to obtain licenses, conduct thorough customer due diligence, maintain transaction records, and comply with anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) measures, these regulations are poised to create a more secure and compliant environment for all stakeholders.  Recognizing the significance of these regulations, the Hong Kong Blockchain Association has praised the SFC’s proactive approach, hailing the rules as a positive step towards enhancing the cryptocurrency industry in Hong Kong. By establishing a framework that balances innovation and security, these regulations are poised to unlock the full potential of cryptocurrencies and drive further adoption in the region.  While critics have voiced concerns about potential innovation stifling or insufficient investor protection, it is essential to appreciate that the SFC has meticulously calibrated these regulations to strike the right balance. By taking a risk-based enforcement approach, the SFC aims to target those VASPs that pose the greatest risk to investors, leaving room for growth and fostering an environment that encourages responsible innovation.  As the industry eagerly awaits the implementation of these forward-looking regulations, Hong Kong’s cryptocurrency landscape is poised for a remarkable transformation. With $Lina, $ACH, $CFX, and $COCOS among the frontrunners benefiting from enhanced regulatory oversight, the stage is set for these coins to shine and capture the attention of savvy investors seeking promising opportunities.  The embrace of these regulations by Hong Kong signifies the region’s commitment to becoming a global hub for cryptocurrency innovation. As the regulatory framework solidifies, these coins and the broader crypto market are well-positioned for a bright and prosperous future, built on trust, transparency, and investor confidence.

Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee announced ex gratia of Rs 2.5 lakh for the families of the deceased. She said the owner of this illegal firecracker factory was arrested earlier but he got bail.  Responding to the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party’s National Investigation Agency probe into the blast, Banerjee said she does not have a problem with the NIA but the matter should not be politicised.  State Environment Minister Manas Ranjan Bhunia confirmed the explosion and said that the government would take steps to provide help to people affected. “We appeal to people to inform us of any illegal firecracker factories that they know of in their area… we will take strong steps against such units,” he said.  A police official said the impact of the explosion “was so massive” that the factory, which was being run from a residential building, collapsed. “It took place inside a house where the firecracker unit was functioning. An investigation is underway,” the police officer added.  Leader of the Opposition in West Bengal Assembly Suvendu Adhikari demanded the NIA probe into the blast and sought the intervention of Home Minister Amit Shah and Governor CV Ananda Bose. Adhikari said central forces should be deployed as dead bodies are being shifted illegally by West Bengal Police.  Villagers told PTI that the entire house looked like a “war zone”.

"explosion","2023-03-01","Not Discerned","{""Alabama"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 22:03:00","By James Rogers  Debut has been delayed after explosion during test launch earlier this year  United Launch Alliance is eyeing a debut launch for the company's new Vulcan rocket later this year, according to Chief Executive Tory Bruno.  Vulcan will be the successor to ULA's Delta IV and Atlas V rockets. ULA was set up in 2006 as a joint venture between Boeing Co. (BA) and Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT). Since then, the company's Delta and Atlas rockets have been used to send more than 150 missions into orbit.  ""I expect we will see that [first Vulcan] launch sometime between summer and later this year,"" Bruno said during a streamed interview at the Human to Mars Summit in Washington on Tuesday.  ULA had initially planned for a Vulcan debut launch in May, but that was pushed back when a Vulcan rocket's upper stage suffered an anomaly during testing at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama in March, according to Space.com. The explosion was first reported by Ars Technica. Bruno subsequently tweeted that a hydrogen leak caused an explosion during the test.  Space.com reported that the upper stage that exploded was not part of the hardware for the debut Vulcan launch. ""We will sort that out, we will resolve it,"" Bruno said Tuesday.  Related:Virgin Galactic sets sights on first commercial launch  ULA undertook Vulcan rocket tests to simulate a launch day at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station last week.  Vulcan's booster propulsion is provided by a pair of BE-4 engines manufactured by Blue Origin, which was founded by Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos. ""I am very happy with my partner there,"" said Bruno.  The BE-4 engines use liquid oxygen and liquefied natural gas, a commercially available form of methane. Unlike other rocket propellants, such as kerosene, liquefied natural gas eliminates the need for expensive and complex pressurization systems, such as helium, which is in increasingly scarce supply, according to ULA.  The new ULA rocket also integrates up to six Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC) Solid Rocket Boosters, or SRBs.  Speaking at the Humans to Mars Summit, Bruno also discussed ULA's contract with Amazon to support its Project Kuiper, which will launch a constellation of 3,236 satellites into low Earth orbit. The deal, which was announced last year, will see the Vulcan rocket used for 38 launches.  See Now: SpaceX's Starship launch sent dust cloud of sand and soil over nearby city  ""I have to quadruple my launch rate by the middle of 2025,"" said Bruno, describing the project as ""a great challenge to have.""  -James Rogers  This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

These tremors were first recorded on Saturday, after the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GUES)—the official body that monitors the underground—received ""more than 60"" tips from people in Bornholm about ""earthquake-like tremors"" reported in the afternoon.  They described the tremors as deep rumbling, shaking and rattling, and changing pressure in the ear.  Initially, many falsely believed that they may have been caused by earthquakes. Seismologists had theorised that they may have originated from controlled explosions in Poland, more than nearly 90 miles (145 km) to the south.  However, on Monday, the GUES clarified that the tremors were ""not caused by earthquakes, but by pressure waves from an event in the atmosphere."" However, they came from ""an unknown source.""  ""The seismologists can report that it is unlikely that the tremors originate from a controlled explosion in Poland, which was carried out shortly before the first reports of tremors on Bornholm,"" the body known as GEUS said in a statement. Scientists develop fabric made of 'Fungi' which needs no stitching Danish media reported that police had received complaints from the public about the tremor on the eastern part of the island. The tremors also caused a crack in the wall of some of the houses. But no one was injured.  The Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland said that seismic tremors were measured at a magnitude of 2.3.  Polish authorities have said that there was intensive activity during the Anakonda23 exercise in Ustka, northern Poland, involving jet fighters and live firing of artillery munitions.  GEUS, an independent research and advisory institution within Denmark’s Ministry of Climate, Energy and Utilities, said that it had two seismographs on Bornholm that collect data around the clock.  Bornholm is home to nearly 40,000 people. It is a rocky island in the Baltic Sea, south of Sweden, northeast of Germany and north of Poland.

The game is a MOBA-like game where teams of three work to disable the opposing team’s barriers and score, akin to air hockey. Each of the 15 characters brings something unique to the table, such as Rune’s barriers that double as both goalie tools and ways to damage enemy players or Era’s powerful support tools that buff allies and debuff opposing players.  The game launched with 15 playable characters, three of which were added on the initial release oof the game after it left Steam Early Access. The game also saw console ports over the past two weeks (to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and Xbox consoles). Over the past week, Odyssey has been teasing new content, which comes in today’s big patch.  This update brings two brand-new playable characters to the game, Octavia and Vyce. Both of them also have kit breakdowns released that we’ll go over. First, Octavia; her kit focuses on buffing herself and maintaining momentum, as her Secondary ability is an infinitely stacking speed boost that extends so long as you’re hitting the Core. Her Primary ability is a projectile that deals damage and slows, making it a good disruption tool. Finally, Octavia’s Special emits five pulses that damage an area around her periodically.  You can view Octavia’s gameplay trailer below.  Comparatively, Vyce looks to be quite a powerful offensive character. She has access to a stun with an area-of-effect radius in her Secondary slot, and her Primary is a projectile with a pretty good range. Vyce’s Special ability involves her remaining immobile and charging up a big shockwave that grows in size the longer you charge it. Upon release, anything inside the shockwave takes big damage. While charging, Vyce has full knockback immunity but can still take damage.  You can view Vyce’s gameplay trailer below.  Today’s update for Omega Strikers also contains a new battle arena in the form of the Demon Dais stage. This new stage has two separate barriers in the form of large speakers on each side of the field with two barriers within. The update also has new skins for Kai, Atlas, and Ai.Mi, and some balance changes (including a full rework for Asher) which can all be read here.  We’ll continue to update as more information on Omega Strikers, including DLC, trailers, updates, and more, as it’s released. Omega Strikers is available now on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL29tZWdhLXN0cmlrZXJzLWJyaW5ncy10aGUtZXhwbG9zaXZlLWRlYnV0LW9mLW9jdGF2aWEtYW5kLXZ5Y2Utd2l0aC1tYXNzaXZlLWJhbGFuY2UtcGF0Y2gv0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly93Y2NmdGVjaC5jb20vb21lZ2Etc3RyaWtlcnMtYnJpbmdzLXRoZS1leHBsb3NpdmUtZGVidXQtb2Ytb2N0YXZpYS1hbmQtdnljZS13aXRoLW1hc3NpdmUtYmFsYW5jZS1wYXRjaC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"explosion","2021-02-21","Not Discerned","{""Paris"", ""IleDeFrance"", ""France""}","Wed 17 May 2023 05:50:24","It was an average Monday on February 21, 2021, car doors were slamming as people traversed roads on their way to work. The last days of Winter grew closer and the sun began shining a little brighter with every passing moment. Everything was seemingly perfect for the average fan of Daft Punk, that was until the duo made a rare appearance on social media to announce that after 28 years of groundbreaking production and mesmerizing melodies, they are calling it quits. The announcement of their split was paired with a clip from the closing scenes of their 2006 film “Electrorama”, which saw the pair in full Daft Punk garb shaking hands and walking off, only for one member to reveal a bomb and promptly explode. That explosion became more than a cinematic trick as every blog and Daft Punk fan page blew up with fond memories and grief for one of the most successful music groups in recent memory.  Attempting to sum up Daft Punk’s impact on music in one article is a fool’s errand, so let’s focus on a moment in their career that changed the Daft Punk history books as we knew it. 2013 was far from the group’s “break out” year but it did see a massive resurgence in popularity for the duo, and not because an old classic was resurfaced for the sake of social media. 10 years ago (5/17/13), Daft Punk released what would be their final album together. Random Access Memories birthed the tremendously popular single “Get Lucky”, which featured Pharell Williams crooning over funky live instrumentation which included the now iconic guitar melodies strummed out by the great Nile Rodgers. While the album now marks the last official release for Daft Punk, its impact on Daft Punk’s career was obvious long before their break up 8 years later.  Random Access Memories is the duo’s first studio album since 2005’s Human After All which saw the band deconstruct their signature production style and rebuild it into an industrial wall of sound. Coming off what could now be considered Daft Punk’s most aggressive LP and giving fans plenty of time in between releases, Daft Punk was able to completely wipe the slate clean. They’ve already pushed the boundaries of electronic pop and their final album would aim to conquer an area of music that Daft Punk never had the opportunity to take part in. The album has the duo shifting their focus to a more disco-friendly sonic direction and began incorporating live instrumentation into their recording process, leaving only a few programmed drum machines and vintage vocoder melodies as traces of their past sound. This allowed Daft Punk’s music to sound larger than ever, with songs like the explosive intro “Give Life Back To Music” and the Paul Williams-assisted “Touch” bringing a sleek shine to the LP. Random Access Memories is driven by deep grooves, infectious rhythms, and pure love for dance music, and the extensive list of A-list collaborators is only the icing on the cake.  You know there is something special about an album when it takes this long into talking about it to mention that there is a stirringly beautiful Julian Casablancas ballad on the tracklist. For the first time in their careers, Daft Punk opened their studio doors to outside collaborators to help work on a studio album of theirs and they brought in a cast of characters only Daft Punk can assemble. Along with the aforementioned Casablancas and Paul Williams, the likes of Panda Bear, Todd Edwards, Pharrell Williams, and Nile Rodgers are credited as guests on Random Access Memories. What makes these appearances so special is how Daft Punk deployed them, the duo brought these features into their world to uplift their compositions, only bringing in guests when necessary. They could’ve gotten anyone to sing on “The Game of Love” but they seemed to be just as happy with their robotically smooth vocals taking the spotlight. The Panda Bear-assisted “Doin’ It Right” is a minimal, repetitive dance track that has Bear harmonizing with those same vocals from “The Game of Love”, not the usual Panda Bear ascetic but a role he filled beyond expectations. Daft Punk’s use of features on Random Access Memories speaks to not only their overall creativity but may have hinted that their break up nearly a decade later was clear from the release of the album, using Random Access Memories to knock off some bucket list collaborations in a sensational fashion.  Random Access Memories now has somewhat of a bittersweet taste to it 10 years later. While it now acts as Daft Punk’s swan song, it also stands as a testament to two musicians who approached their art with tireless creativity and delivered unforgettable moments of pure fun and musicianship. In 2013 it seemed like Daft Punk had nothing else to prove, they had hits and had won over the hearts of snobby critics and hard-headed music fans alike with their refreshing take on electronic pop music. They approached their fourth studio album as if they had already decided it was their last and left nothing to be desired. The 13 songs that comprise the LP take you through the colorful cosmos of Daft Punk as the duo waves goodbye in an explosion of vivid arrangements, undeniable chemistry, and, most important of all, unforgettable electronic music.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vZ2xpZGVtYWdhemluZS5jb20vMjkxMjczLzEwLXllYXJzLWxhdGVyLXJldmlzaXRpbmctZGFmdC1wdW5rcy1jb2xsYWJvcmF0aXZlLWdhbWUtY2hhbmdlci1yYW5kb20tYWNjZXNzLW1lbW9yaWVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak greeted Zelenskyy with a handshake and hug after the president's helicopter landed at Chequers, the British leader's official country retreat. It was Zelenskyy's second trip to the U.K. since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, and the fifth European country he's visited in three days.  He is seeking more military aid as Ukraine prepares a long-anticipated spring offensive to retake Russian-occupied territory. The Ukrainian leader also visited Italy, the Vatican, Germany and France.  Russia reacted to the U.K.'s new pledge ""extremely negatively,"" but also doubts that the missiles and drones would drastically change the course of the war, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday.  ""Britain aspires to be at the forefront among countries that continue to pump weapons into Ukraine,"" Peskov said. ""We repeat once again: It cannot yield any drastic and fundamental influence on the way the special military operation (in Ukraine) is unfolding. But definitely it leads to further destruction. ... It makes this whole story for Ukraine much more complicated.""  Zelenskyy said one of the missions of his European travels that started Saturday was to build a ""fighter jet coalition"" to provide Ukraine with vital military power in the air. He said more work was needed on that front.  While the U.K. will not provide the planes, the prime minister said the country would join the coalition and begin a previously announced training program for Ukrainian fighter pilots as soon as this summer.  The U.K., one of Ukraine's major military allies, has provided short-range missiles, Challenger tanks and trained 15,000 Ukrainian troops on British soil. Last week, the government announced it had sent Ukraine Storm Shadow cruise missiles, which have a range of more than 150 miles. The British missiles were the first known shipment of longer-range weaponry that Kyiv has long sought from its allies.  Sunak's office said it was giving Ukraine hundreds more air defense missiles, as well as ""long-range attack drones"" with a reach of more than 120 miles.  ""This is a crucial moment in Ukraine's resistance to a terrible war of aggression they did not choose or provoke,"" Sunak said. ""They need the sustained support of the international community to defend against the barrage of unrelenting and indiscriminate attacks that have been their daily reality for over a year.  ""We must not let them down,"" the prime minister added.  Sunak plans to push allies at a meeting of the Group of Seven leaders in Japan later this week to deliver more support to Ukraine, his representative said.  As Zelenskyy visited European capitals, Russia increased its attacks across Ukraine with drones and missiles. Russia shelled two communities Sunday in the northern border province of Sumy, regional officials said on Telegram. They said 109 explosions were recorded.  Zelenskyy's office said Monday that Russian attacks had killed nine civilians and injured 19 in the past day. Six of the deaths were in southern Ukraine's Kherson province. Two civilians were killed in Chuhuiv in Kharkiv province, and one in Prymorsk, on the Azov Sea coast about 12 miles from Russian-occupied Berdyansk.  The presidential office also reported that Marhanets, which lies across the river from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, was shelled.  Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti reported that an acting regional interior minister appointed by Moscow, Igor Kornet, was injured in an explosion at a barbershop in the Russian-occupied city of Luhansk. The leader of the Luhansk People's Republic, a separatist-held region of Ukraine that Moscow illegally annexed, was quoted as saying a bomb caused the explosion.  Assassination attempts and sabotage attacks have increased in Russian-occupied territory as well as Russia proper. Russian authorities often blame Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv rarely acknowledges such attacks.  Zelenskyy traveled to Britain from Paris, where he met Sunday with French President Emmanuel Macron and secured a pledge of light tanks, armored vehicles and air defense systems.      About 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers will receive training in France this year and nearly 4,000 others in Poland, Macron's office said.  Speaking Monday on the French television network TF1, Macron said training on French fighter jets such as the Mirage 2000 ""can start now"" but rejected the idea of France delivering warplanes to Ukraine.  Zelenskyy also met with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Sunday. It was his first visit to Berlin since the start of the invasion and came a day after the German government announced military aid for Ukraine worth more than $3 billion.  Modern Western hardware is considered crucial if Ukraine is to succeed in its planned counteroffensive. During his European trip, Zelenskyy said Ukraine would aim to liberate Russian-occupied areas within Ukraine's internationally recognized borders and would not attack Russian territory.  Among areas Russia still occupies are the Crimean Peninsula and parts of eastern Ukraine with mainly Russian-speaking populations.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm53YW9ubGluZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzL21heS8xNi96ZWxlbnNreXktcHVzaGVzLWZvci1maWdodGVyLWpldC1jb2FsaXRpb24vP25ld3Mtd29ybGTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

LDO tried to break an important resistance area but failed.  With strong bullish signals again this Tuesday, expect a rally that could extend all the way up to $3.37.  Lido DAO (LDO) price has set the performance bar rather high for itself this summer. With bulls chasing price action higher on Monday, a rejection occurred as bulls ventured to attack $2.20, where both a pivotal level and the 55-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) are being used by bears as defensive structures. Once that area is reclaimed by bulls this week, expect to see a rally that could go well into the summer and hit $3.37 with a 60% profit in the books.  Lido DAO price to be the trade of the season out of the bunch  Lido DAO price is already heading for a very solid performance with a 10% gain already on record for this week. From the looks of it, bulls are back with a vengeance and have already erased all incurred losses for May. If bulls play this right, this could be the best recovery trade of the year, and LDO is set to outperform some peers in the process.  LDO first needs to pare the selling pressure from bears at $2.20, where they have built a fortress around that historically pivotal level and the 55-day SMA that resides nearby. With the bullish performance setting the tone for this week, expect to see that level being torn down later on Tuesday and bulls heading for $2.60. The rally should continue into July with a few catalysts along the way that could lift LDO higher and head toward $3.37.  LDO/USD 4H-chart  A threat to the downside could come with another rejection at $2.20 and one of the tail risks in the US inflating again, such as the on-again-off-again banking turmoil or the debt ceiling negotiations. Expect then to see a leg lower with $2 doubtful to hold. Rather look for $1.85 and the 200-day SMA in between $2 and $1.85 as a circuit breaker to slow down any violent drops depending on the severity of the tail risk or catalyst.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ4c3RyZWV0LmNvbS9jcnlwdG9jdXJyZW5jaWVzL25ld3MvbGlkby1kYW8tcHJpY2UtaXMtYWJvdXQtdG8tZXhwbG9kZS02MC1hbmQtYnJlYWstYWJvdmUtMy0yMDIzMDUxNjExMTbSAXdodHRwczovL3d3dy5meHN0cmVldC5jb20vYW1wL2NyeXB0b2N1cnJlbmNpZXMvbmV3cy9saWRvLWRhby1wcmljZS1pcy1hYm91dC10by1leHBsb2RlLTYwLWFuZC1icmVhay1hYm92ZS0zLTIwMjMwNTE2MTExNg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

In a jaw-dropping +70,000% moon-shot, millionaires were made in hours in the latest race to profit.  Now in an aggressive cascading retracement, it is clear early backers are securing their profit.  DEXTools / SHROOMS USD  Indeed, despite pittance liquidity of $179k, $SHROOMS trading volume has surged to a whopping $5.56m in the past 24 hours.  This brings $SHROOMS market cap to a lowly $1.43m indicating there could still be room for growth if $SHROOMS is able to consolidate at a high support level - but not much else is known about the coin.  With an emerging tribe of 1,790 holders and over 2000 transactions in the opening 24 hours $SHROOMS seems to be the most recent meme coin to gain traction.  How to Get in Early on Meme Coin Moonshots?  With millionaires made in the opening minutes of meme coin launches, as brave DEX explorers discover hidden gems poised to explode to the upside - many are asking how can you get in early on meme coin moon-shots?  After all, by the time you've seen a +70,000% gain - it is likely far too late to make major profits and this leaves you exposed to potential downside dumps.  Some of the obvious steps you can take to ensure you're investing in only the highest quality meme coins (and avoid getting rug-pulled!) are:  Check the meme coin's smart contract using a Honeypot Detector (ensuring you can sell to lock-in new found gains). Check the funding of deployer's wallets (examine the prelaunch transactions of deployment wallet, ideally finding a 'clean' wallet, in which the only transactions are the purchase of ETH and the creation of the smart contract address). Check if the contract address is verified (this can be done on Etherscan). Check if meme coin liquidity has been locked (it is important to ensure LPs are locked to ensure you can complete later sale of coins). Check if the meme coin project has an active Website, Twitter account, Telegram and Medium (the greater the social media presence, the less chance of a rug pull). Double-check whether the token has both buys and sells (using tools that monitor DEX transactions to avoid honey pots). Check the token holders (if huge swathes of supply are held by few wallets, this could lead to seismic dumping action). Check the buy and sell fees (if transaction fees to deployer are higher than 10% avoid).  By following these steps you can begin to develop a well-researched understanding of what makes a meme coin legitimate, however, to undertake these checks will require a depth of crypto expertise and a familiarity with complex DEX tools.

Despite the extremely wet winter the whole region experienced, Wilbourn said fire crews are still expecting to see active fires this summer.""We've got the taller grass. It's obviously been growing for a while, but then you see underneath, there's a lower-level grass. We call that a double growth. So obviously, there's been different parts of the season where we experienced rain and then we've had a lull to allow the grass to grow, then it goes back to rain, and now we're seeing hot weather again, so these are just different levels of growth that really creates a dense fuel load,"" Wilbourn said. ""The overall landscape and topography of our area in the flat region. It's going to be hot. Fuels are going to dry out very quickly and we're going to continue to have fires.""Wilbourn said that includes fires that begin at homeless encampments, which he said have been increasing in Sacramento County.""Year over year, we've seen an 111% increase in unhoused-related fires, so that means people that are out in the fields, maybe they're cooking for themselves. They have an open flame. The fire gets away and runs and potentially causes a larger fire,"" Wilbourn said.Firefighters from the Sacramento Fire Department and the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District responded to a homeless encampment fire Tuesday afternoon. A spokesperson with the Sacramento Fire Department told KCRA 3 that trees started to catch fire just after 4 p.m. on 14th Avenue near Power Inn Road in Sacramento. Fire crews arrived within minutes and quickly put out the flames.Cellphone video sent to KCRA 3 shows the moments the flames jumped into the higher branches of the trees.

"explosion","2020-08-15","Not Discerned","{""Beirut"", ""Beirut"", ""Lebanon""}","Wed 17 May 2023 06:42:24","One night, around ten years ago in Lebanon, when I was supposed to be deep in my dreams, I came across a picture of some street in New York on a stranger’s Facebook page. I ran to my mom, asking her if we could go there in the summer, and she kept nodding her head until it was convincing enough for me to go back to sleep. Ten years later, the New York City lights keep me awake all night long. I remain in a waking dream.  On my plane to NYC, I kept wondering why the Stanford in New York program would choose that our dorms be located in Brooklyn as opposed to Manhattan, the heart of the city. In my head, that only meant missing out on events, a longer commute and wasted hours. I was wrong.  Brooklyn Heights feels exactly like my hometown, Saida, while being nothing like it. It is close to the city but also far from it. Brooklyn Heights, just like Saida, is the best of both worlds.  The Stanford in New York apartments are next to the Brooklyn Heights promenade, which offers among the most iconic views in the city. You can see the Brooklyn Bridge, the Empire State building, the Chrysler building and even the Statue of Liberty while standing there. You can peek into the chaos and the rush of the cars while basking in the sun, watching it go down and making sure you take the right pictures so that you will not have to come back tomorrow, which you already know you will.  On Sunday, I sat there on a bench next to a married couple, with my favorite Montague Street Bagels, and I noticed how most people were silent, even though their footsteps were audible.  On Monday, as I took a lunch break from my work at the NYC Commission on Human Rights, I couldn’t even call my mom because I was distracted by the conversations around me, curious to know more, but also because I couldn’t hear a word she said.  Beirut has changed a lot after the August 2020 explosion, but it remains a lively city that blooms during the summers when foreigners and immigrants come back to celebrate togetherness and visit their old memories. Being in Beirut means hearing music from every corner, having to cover your ears when cars start honking at a minor inconvenience and listening to conversations of girls your age planning their weekend getaways because they wanted to “party the pain away.”  I’d spend my days in Beirut, hopping from one friend’s apartment to the next, eating take-out food and complaining about the skyrocketing prices. Sometimes, I was too enraptured in that chaos, thinking about relocating with no real plan or strategy. However, all I needed was a single voice message from my mom, telling me what my grandmother cooked today and how I should come back so we could watch “Olympus has fallen” for the tenth time together; telling me to come back to Saida.  Saida has also changed a lot after the Beirut explosion. People hide their trauma behind their smiles in the most noticeable way possible. What characterizes Saida is the people inhabiting it. Living there, you have to negotiate for thirty minutes before accepting a gift, try out every food on the table or explain to the host that it wouldn’t be personal if you fail and end every day with a coffee run with your favorite people, bumping into at least five of your least favorite people. Saida is more intimate. You spend your whole life dreaming of getting out and once you do, you start counting down the days till you’re back. While I enjoy traveling to new places, I’ve never met people like the ones in Saida.  Saida is the perfect balance to Beirut, but Beirut is not the same without Saida. The same way that Brooklyn Heights is the perfect balance to Manhattan, but Manhattan is not the same without Brooklyn Heights.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vc3RhbmZvcmRkYWlseS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8xNi90aGUtYmVzdC1vZi1ib3RoLXdvcmxkcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"explosion","2023-12-04","19:00:00","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 02:56:53","RIDLEY TWP. — Owen Bosak was aware of the playoff drought at Ridley High.  Last season the Green Raiders made it back to the District 1 tournament, but were bounced quickly in the opening round. The last time Ridley hosted a playoff game before Tuesday was in 2017. And the last time the team won in the postseason, home or away, came in 2015, when Bosak and Ridley’s current senior class were elementary school students.  The Hofstra recruit wanted to put on a show against No. 19 Pennsbury and lead the 14th-seeded Green Raiders to victory in the postseason. He didn’t disappoint.  Bosak scored five goals, all in the first half, and dominated the face-off circle in Ridley’s 20-7 trouncing of the visiting Falcons. Ridley (11-8) will travel to No. 3 Pennridge Thursday.  “It’s been seven years since we had a home playoff game,” Bosak said. “I told the guys that this means too much for us to go down. This is the last time playing here at (Phil Marion Field) for the seniors, so we came out fired up.”  Pennsbury had no answer for Bosak, who won 21 of 25 face offs and set the tempo for the Green Raiders offense. After Michael DeZutel gave Pennsbury a 1-0 lead less than two minutes into regulation, Bosak answered to put Ridley on the board.  Bosak found the back of the net three times in a span of two minutes, 36 seconds at the end of the first half. His explosion in the waning minutes before halftime put the Green Raiders in firm control. He pulled off some sweet moves, too, juking and twisting his way to his third goal.  Kolby Ranniello tallied to cut Pennsbury’s deficit to 7-5 with 1:23 left in the second period, but all that did was anger Bosak, who won the ensuing faceoff and darted to the net to score his fourth goal. His fifth and final goal with 55 seconds to go extended Ridley’s advantage to 9-5.  “We came out in sync,” Bosak said. “I haven’t seen us have a game like this all year with this type of energy. Especially from the crowd, too.”  While Bosak was thrilled to see his teammates rise to the occasion, he didn’t mince words about his individual performance.  “I was on today,” he said. “My wingers helped me as well, but I think I was on today.”  The Green Raiders put the game out of reach when they scored five of the final six goals of the third period. They outscored the Falcons11-2 after halftime.  Luke Showalter had a huge day with four goals and two assists.

Koa Purugganan was recognized last week during the agency’s annual honorary awards celebration, which was held at Reagan National Airport in Arlington, Virginia.  Koa can be seen working regularly at LAS with 6-year-old German Shorthaired Pointer Bimbo-Boom, affectionately nicknamed “Bubba.” Koa has been a canine handler since 2019.  TSA has more than 400 canine handlers across the country who work alongside explosive detection dogs who are trained to work in busy transportation environments. Together, the handlers and dogs are a visible and effective added layer of security within the nation’s transportation system.  “We are thrilled that Koa has been recognized for the outstanding job he along with his four-legged partner Bubba do for the airport community. Koa’s commitment and leadership have made our canine operation at LAS second to none,” said TSA Federal Security Director for Nevada Karen Burke. “Koa is a team player who proactively seeks ways to improve the effectiveness of the canine program while also taking time to mentor other canine handlers to help them improve in the job they do. He and Bubba are exceptional members of our team and are deserving of this award.""  Koa has distinguished himself as a lead trainer for the local canine teams, developing multiple scenarios to test the proficiency  of the dogs and handlers in a variety of situations and locations. He has also implemented daily schedules that maximize the use of canines in screening operations and reduced “down time” for canine teams during daily work assignments.  TSA canines and handlers are most often seen at airports working in the security checkpoint, assisting with the efficiency and effectiveness of TSA’s screening operations. They are also trained to work in mass transit, commuter rail, maritime passenger ferry environments and in other busy venues supporting security operations for marquis events.  These canines are able to conduct a real-time threat assessment of travelers going through the security checkpoint. If a dog alerts its handler to the presence of explosive odor, TSA follows an established procedure to resolve the alarm.  Koa joined TSA in 2014 as a TSA officer (TSO), was later promoted to Lead TSO before being named Supervisory TSO at Kona International Airport on the Island of Hawaii. Koa transitioned to the role of canine handler and began working at LAS. Together, Koa and Bubba supported security operations at the 2022 NFL Draft in Las Vegas and have participated in Reno 911 Training. Bubba is an energetic dog who loves to come to work. When he is at home with Koa, he enjoys running around in the backyard. His favorite reward toy is anything that squeaks.  This is the not the first time the canine program at LAS has been recognized nationally. In August 2021, TSA announced that Alona, then a four-year-old Golden Retriever and explosives detection canine was the winner of the TSA “Cutest Canine” contest. Alona and her handler Vanessa continue to work at LAS.  TSA at LAS is consistently one of the busiest airports in the country, screening more than 23 million departing passengers in 2022.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRzYS5nb3YvbmV3cy9wcmVzcy9yZWxlYXNlcy8yMDIzLzA1LzE3L3RzYS1jYW5pbmUtaGFuZGxlci1yZWNvZ25pemVkLWV4Y2VwdGlvbmFsLXBlcmZvcm1hbmNlLWxlYWRlcnNoaXAtbGFz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Amazon Prime members can now add pickleball coverage to their list of membership benefits.  Amazon's Prime Video streaming platform announced Tuesday it's signed a multiyear deal with the Professional Pickleball Association for global streaming rights to four live PPA Tour events per year, including the 2023-2024 PPA Tour World Championship Series.  Amazon Prime's coverage will kick off with a four-day tournament starting Thursday from the Atlanta Open in Peachtree Corners, Georgia.  ""When something has an explosion in growth, naturally it catches our eye,"" Charlie Neiman, head of sports partnerships at Amazon Prime Video, told CNBC.  Amazon said its coverage will include games with top-ranked players such as Ben Johns, Anna Leigh Walters and Anna Bright.  Connor Pardoe, CEO and cofounder of the Pro Pickleball Association, called the deal ""monumental"" for the burgeoning league.  ""It's important for the evolution of the pro game, the game as a whole, and a nice step forward for the professional players,"" he added.  Prime's deal with the PPA also deepens its commitment to the world of sports streaming rights, which range from Thursday Night Football to emerging sports leagues and sports documentaries.  Neiman says Amazon has had tremendous success investing in other emerging properties such as MMA's One Championship or Overtime Elite Basketball. He thinks pickleball has significant growth potential as well, he said.  ""We're always looking at content and making sure our offerings on Prime Video reflect our customers' interests,"" he said.  For pickleball enthusiasts, seeing their sport on the small screen, along with the ability to stream games, is welcome news. But patchwork and evolving media strategy has also made it confusing where to watch.  The PPA Tour's 20-plus tournaments in 2023 can be seen across a variety of platforms that also includes ABC, Fox, CBS, YouTube, the Tennis Channel and FanDuel. Earlier this month, the PPA Tour announced that ESPN will cover eight of the league's tournaments.  ""Where pickleball is today, it's a sport that's really hot,"" said Pardoe. ""It's really exciting and nobody wants to miss out on it. But also, no one's really ready to commit to the whole thing as well.""  Pardoe said it will take time to get a more concise and consistent media deal, but today the league is focused on getting its brand ""anywhere and everywhere.""  Pickleball continues to see rapid growth, with an estimated 36 million people picking up a paddle between August 2021 and August 2022, according to a report by the Association of Pickleball Professionals. The sport grew more than 158% over the past three years, according to the 2023 Sports Fitness Industry Association Topline Participation Report.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTYvYW1hem9uLXByaW1lLXByb2Zlc3Npb25hbC1waWNrbGViYWxsLWFzc29jaWF0aW9uLXRvdXJuYW1lbnRzLmh0bWzSAWVodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMy8wNS8xNi9hbWF6b24tcHJpbWUtcHJvZmVzc2lvbmFsLXBpY2tsZWJhbGwtYXNzb2NpYXRpb24tdG91cm5hbWVudHMuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Kill Your Stereo is premiering the electric music video before its official release tomorrow. Pulling from influences as noisy and unique as Rage Against The Machine, Jeff Buckley, Royal Blood and Muse, My Hero The Homewrecker features an extravagant display of theatrics.  The video itself takes viewers on a visually stunning journey as the band plays the song out. Showcasing a dynamic and vibrant colour palette, the clip perfectly complements the raw intensity of the track.  My Hero The Homewrecker opens with a neo-classical violin intro that sets the scene, leading the way for crushing guitars and pounding drums to compliment the song’s distinctive feel.  Walter Webb has the falsetto and effortless cool of Muse’s Matt Bellamy and a bass-playing style akin to the English band’s bassist Chris Wolstenholme. The rest of the band – violinist Isaac Vincent, Angelo Webb (drums, samples) and guitarist Kalen Austin fire on all cylinders, bringing the ambitious, towering track to life.  Never miss a story! Subscribe to our newsletter Sign Up  Green and purple lights flash on the set as confetti falls during the song’s chorus. Mecha Mecha's music blurs the lines of dark indie rock and neo-classical metal, with tinges of psytrance and EDM.

My Hero The Homewrecker follows previously released tracks from the band including Greedy Boys and Caught In A Cage. For the former, Mecha Mecha told The Music, “The song is highlighting the extended childhood the members of this band feel we have been given. Both in the support from our family and friends to pursue our music dreams, but also sort of culturally we’ve been allowed to chase a teenage dream.”  You can catch Mecha Mecha performing My Hero The Homewrecker at Moondoll Festival at Mansfield Tavern, Brisbane, on Saturday, 3 June.

Recently, astronomers utilised this telescope's cutting-edge technology to observe a distant star-forming galaxy, delving into its intricate structure with unprecedented detail.  Discovery of the Galaxy  Harnessing the capabilities of NASA's billion-dollar observatory, the James Webb Space Telescope's Orbiter Spacecraft has unveiled the stellar composition of GN20, one of the earliest-known galaxies in the universe. Situated a staggering 12 billion light years away, this captivating discovery represents a luminous and dust-laden star-forming galaxy of extraordinary brilliance.  Significance of the Galaxy  What makes GN20 particularly intriguing is its relatively recent formation, occurring a mere 1.5 billion years after the cataclysmic event known as the Big Bang. Positioned within a region of space referred to as a protocluster or galaxy overdensity, this area holds astronomers' fascination due to its eventual culmination in the formation of colossal galactic clusters.  Insights into the Galaxy's Structure  The captivating image captured by the James Webb Space Telescope allows us to peer back in time when the universe was a mere 1.5 billion years old, as it stands at approximately 13.5 million years presently. Astonishingly, this ancient galaxy boasts a star formation rate approximately 1,860 times greater than the mass of our Sun each year. Astronomers, under the guidance of Luis Colina from the Spanish Astrobiology Centre, employed the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) to examine GN20's structural properties during November 23-24, 2022.  Findings of the Study  Analysis of the MIRI images unveiled a clumpy molecular gas surrounding the galaxy, forming a colossal disk spanning about 46,000 light-years in diameter. Furthermore, the measurements indicated that the galaxy comprises a diffuse gas envelope encompassing a densely packed nucleus of shimmering stars. Remarkably, the nucleus spans a mere 2,600 light-years across, while the gaseous envelope extends approximately 23,000 light-years.  About the James Webb Space Telescope  James Webb Space Telescope stands as NASA's most prominent and powerful space science observatory. Boasting a large infrared telescope with a primary mirror of around 6.5 metres, this state-of-the-art instrument represents a monumental leap forward in our quest to understand the cosmos. It has been positioned a million miles out into space. It orbits the Sun and not the Earth.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3RlY2guaGluZHVzdGFudGltZXMuY29tL3RlY2gvbmV3cy9leHRyYW9yZGluYXJ5LWphbWVzLXdlYmItc3BhY2UtdGVsZXNjb3BlLXNuYXBzLWV4cGxvc2l2ZS1zdGFyLWJpcnRoLWFmdGVyLXRoZS1iaWctYmFuZy03MTY4NDIyMzE1MDY5OS5odG1s0gGYAWh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaC5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vYW1wL3RlY2gvbmV3cy9leHRyYW9yZGluYXJ5LWphbWVzLXdlYmItc3BhY2UtdGVsZXNjb3BlLXNuYXBzLWV4cGxvc2l2ZS1zdGFyLWJpcnRoLWFmdGVyLXRoZS1iaWctYmFuZy03MTY4NDIyMzE1MDY5OS5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

OKX is the fifth-ranked exchange, according to CoinMarketCap data with a 24-hour trading volume of $825 million, receiving 2.2 million weekly visitors.  $LHINU will list on the top decentralized exchange (DEX) Uniswap at 2 pm UTC, four hours after the OKX listing.  The top centralized exchange announcement means that Love Hate Inu is launching with maximum impact.  Checkout the OKX $LHINU listing announcement tweet.  Love Hate Inu raised $10,204,000 million in its presale, making it one of the largest crypto fundraises of the year.  Given the meme coin frenzy of the past few weeks, Love Hate Inu could not have picked a better time to launch. While many of those meme coins are already dying, Love Hate Inu has a real business model that guarantees it is here to stay.  How and when to claim $LHINU tokens  Token holders from the presale will be able to claim their coins at 9 am UTC Friday 19th, one hour before the OKX listing takes place.  To claim tokens purchased in the presale, holders simply need to connect on the Love Hate Inu website with the wallet originally used to buy the $LHINU tokens, and then click the ‘claim’ button.  The tokens will appear in the token holder’s wallet.  You can still buy $LHINU before the OKX listing – don’t miss the next Shiba Inu  For those who missed out on Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, or Pepe, this is an exceptional opportunity to capture what could be a staggering return on investment.  Love Hate Inu’s unrivaled utility sets it apart, which explains why it has become one of the hottest meme coins of the year. Crypto analysts predict 10x returns for $LHINU.  Today’s crypto investors don’t just want to chase cute Inu coins with no utility. The best crypto projects, like Love Hate Inu, are taking the utility-led approach.  The team believes that by building a great product, it will attract the users.  As such, Love Hate Inu is creating a system that is scalable so that it can onboard potentially millions of users who will want to vote in its polls.  Love Hate Inu packed with viral utility – the only vote-to-earn meme coin  In sharp contrast to many other meme coins, Love Hate Inu is packed with utility. Its primary use case is to enable community members to hold polls on any manner of subject matter.  Voting is secured by staking the $LHINU token, making the polls immune to manipulation. Voting mechanisms are an ideal use case for blockchain technology.  In addition to providing security, the blockchain’s decentralized network architecture enables voters to be rewarded for their participation through the earning of $LHINU tokens.  Users of the platform can vote on anything in the world they think worthy of a poll, from celebrities and personalities they love or loathe to whatever it is that is of trending interest on the web and beyond.  As can be seen by the examples on the project’s website, meme illustrations have been created of personalities such as Donald Trump, Elon Musk and Andrew Tate, that have viral meme qualities.  The imagery is eminently shareable, helping to achieve viral popularity.  The demo polls that the team has been running support that thesis, with huge interest being shown in the numbers taking part. Tens of thousands have taken part.  Love Hate Inu has hit on a winning formula. Precisely because the internet thrives on controversy and polarization, it means there will always be strong demand on both sides of a divide, as voters vie to get the polling outcome that puts them on the winning side.  Source / $LHINU  Love Hate Inu to transform the survey and polling industry  It is not just individual internet users that the project is targeting. Companies and nonprofits will also want to make use of the voting platform to drive brand engagement and to help organizations to reach their goals.  Again, because of the security of the platform and its ability to verify participants as real people because of the staking mechanism, the team believes the Love Hate Inu service will be particularly attractive to companies who want to conduct surveys.  The platform will also be much more accessible and efficient for companies to use than legacy systems. And Love Hate Inu is working on building a VIP onramp for companies, to encourage adoption.  CEO Carl Dawkin: “We are inserting ourselves into the internet’s big conversations”  Love Hate Inu CEO Carl Dawkins, an adviser to the UK All Party Parliamentary Group on Crypto and Digital Assets , is excited to be able to announce $LHINU’s top exchange listing.  “Everyone here at Love Hate Inu wants to extend a big thank you to everyone in our community that has helped to put our token on the map in such a big way,” said Dawkins.  “It is no accident that OKX is listing $LHINU so early in the Love Hate Inu journey, because they clearly recognize a project with potential to generate growing trading volumes.  “But ultimately Love Hate Inu is about launching a product that has the ability to appeal to a mass market audience. We are creatively inserting ourselves into the big conversations that take place across the internet every day.  For the first time people will be able to use a trusted platform with verifiable data to spin up polls on whatever they choose. Our devs are constructing a system that is superior to anything the likes of Twitter is able to offer. We are bot- and manipulation-free.  “The possibilities for the polling platform are immense. From community governance to consumer marketing, Love Hate Inu will transform the survey and polling industry.”  Basic version coming soon – “Seeing a lot of interest from brands looking at what we are doing”  Dawkins continued: “Love Hate Inu’s killer feature is vote-to-earn. None of the legacy platforms can compete with us on that. Because of that, we are already seeing a lot of interest from brands looking at what we are doing.  “You may have spotted that we are teaming up with $SPONGE, where we are taking part in their airdrop, and Web3 games platform Tamadoge that I was previously involved with – but we are also working with Web2 firms interested in using our service.  “Our platform dashboard development is progressing well. We are even looking at the possibility of getting a basic version of the platform ready at launch, with some votes on there.”  “OKX is the first of many more exchange listings. Love Hate Inu really could be the next Shiba Inu, so hold onto your hats as we rocket to the moon.”  Tune in to the Twitter Spaces AMA with Carl Dawkins  You can hear more from Carl in the Twitter Spaces AMA that took place yesterday, in which 4,200 listeners tuned in.  Including discussion of staking, exchange listings strategy, product launch schedule and much more, Dawkins also laid out some of his thoughts on marketing in response to a question about sustaining the hype.  “We have a lot of marketing we are working on as we keep doing what we’re doing – Love Hate Inu is built for the bull run. We have loads of opportunities. We will see dips but also constant spikes as we keep pushing out.  “Twitter raids, games nights on Discord, other contests, other platform partnerships. TikTok we will start attacking too. Also, every new exchange means more exposure. We have a lot of Asian holders to target. We have so many options to explore.""

Hasan is charged with second-degree murder in the death of his ex-girlfriend Melinda Vasilije.  While Hasan has admitted to stabbing Vasilije to death in the spring of 2017, he says she attacked him first, and he blacked out.  Throughout his first four days on the stand, Hasan spoke quietly, with the judge often asking him to speak up.  On Tuesday, Hasan raised his voice and said through tears he did not mean to kill Vasilije - showing intense emotion for the first time since the trial began.  “I should be in jail for a very long time, but I swear to god, I lost control. Convict me for life. I don’t care… but, I blacked out. Don’t try to say I did this in the right mind,” Hasan said, in part.  “I killed her, yes. I didn’t do this out of anger. I didn’t do this because we didn’t get back together. It happened because I was a [..] idiot. It’s all just hitting me.”  Hasan has admitted to stabbing Vasilije 47 times in the early hours of April 28, 2017.  According to Hasan’s previous testimony, after breaking up on April 3, the pair reconciled on the 27.  Security camera footage showed them at Hasan’s vehicle less than an hour before her death.  The footage shows Vasilije going back to her apartment while Hasan walks to his car door.  He then turns around and follows Vasilije back inside.  According to Hasan, once back in her apartment, he admitted to cheating on her during their relationship.  Hasan says at this point she attacked him with a knife. He says he remembers grabbing a knife and stabbing her twice before blacking out.  On cross-examination, Crown attorney Brendan Thomas directed a barrage of questions at Hasan.  “You treated her bad? You cheated on her? You gave her an STI and didn’t tell her? You tried to make her think she was responsible for it? You refused to get treatment? You never told her because you didn’t want to lose the relationship?” Thomas asked.  Hasan answered “yes” to each question.  He was then asked by Thomas: “You were desperate to get her back, you were obsessed, you lied and tried to manipulate her, you said anything to meet with her in person, and you finally got what you wanted?”  He was also asked: “Your one moment of honesty came just before you killed Melinda?”  Court then saw the text Hasan sent Vasilije an hour after her death.  It reads: “Nice seeing you tonight glad we worked things out!! You better have deleted that [..] lol. Anyways see you soon.”  According to Hasan, he sent the message because he thought it might make the police think it wasn't him invovled.  The crown then showed an email sent by Hasan to a Waterloo regional police officer nearly two months after the stabbing  In it, Hasan writes in part: “I’m considering turning myself in, before I do I need you to do something for me. I need you to answer a few questions for me, I know you don’t have to but I will be willing to turn myself in, but I need the answers to these questions first.  He then goes on to say: My first question is, did Melinda ever sleep with anyone else in the course of our relationship (cheat) or not? After we broke up in (sic) April 3 did Melinda ever go on a date between then and April 28? Also did she ever sleep with anyone during the course of that time (sic).”  “If I get the answers I will turn myself in, hopefully before her birthday on June 28.""  The Crown has portrayed Hasan as extremely insecure and obsessed with the idea that Vasilije was cheating on him.  They say this email shows he was still dwelling on it 51 days after he killed her.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8va2l0Y2hlbmVyLmN0dm5ld3MuY2EvZXhwbG9zaXZlLXRlc3RpbW9ueS1hcy1hZ2VyLWhhc2FuLXRyaWFsLW5lYXJzLWNvbmNsdXNpb24tMS42NDAwNjM00gFEaHR0cHM6Ly9iZXRhLmN0dm5ld3MuY2EvbG9jYWwva2l0Y2hlbmVyLzIwMjMvNS8xNi8xXzY0MDA2MzQuYW1wLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Luis “Louie” Ruelas threatened to “f–king bury” people in the explosive trailer for Bravo’s “Teresa Gets Married” special. Bravo  The trailer sees Teresa Giudice breaking down in tears amid her drama with brother Joe Gorga and his wife, Melissa Gorga. Bravo  After breaking down in tears, a woeful Giudice, 50, seems to be talking about her estranged brother when she says, “I just don’t want his name brought up.”  Meanwhile, the “Turning the Tables” author’s eldest daughter, Gia Giudice, suggests that her entire family’s relationship with the Gorgas is all but finished.  “It’s over for everybody — including me and my sisters,” Gia, 22, says in a confessional.  The Gorgas skipped the Aug. 6, 2022, nuptials. Charles Sykes/Bravo  The drama between Teresa and the Gorgas hit its apex in the summer of 2022 after the “Real Housewives of New Jersey” OG brought up rumors that Melissa, 44, cheated on Joe, 47, with longtime friend Nick Barrotta.  A source previously told Page Six the Gorgas — who have been married since 2004 and share three children — “laughed off” the claims.  For more Page Six reality TV updates  Melissa — who, with Joe, subsequently decided to skip Teresa and Ruelas’ Aug. 6, 2022 wedding — later said on her “On Display” podcast, “Sometimes when things are too toxic and you try over and over and over again and it just keeps coming back around to the same thing, even if it’s family, you have to let it go.”  Giudice’s drama with the Gorgas hit its apex in the summer of 2022 as production for “The Real Housewives of New Jersey” Season 13 was winding down. melissagorga/Instagram  Teresa’s longtime frenemy Margaret Josephs, who is close with the Gorgas, attended the wedding, but seemingly felt uncomfortable attending — as she notes in the preview.  “All I can think of is we’re all here and Melissa and Joe are not,” she tells co-stars Jackie Goldschneider and Jennifer Fessler.  Despite the volatile turn of events, there are lighthearted moments expected to play out in “Teresa Gets Married.”  Giudice’s four daughters served as bridesmaids. Charles Sykes/Bravo  Giudice’s co-stars Dolores Catania and Jennifer Aydin were also part of the bridal party. Charles Sykes/Bravo  Several of Teresa’s “Real Housewives” friends — including “Dubai” star Chanel Ayan, “Potomac” star Ashley Darby, “New York City” star Dorinda Medley and “Atlanta” star Kenya Moore — make cameos.  “I love a Jersey wedding,” Medley, 58, says at one point.  Teresa’s infamous wedding hair is also highlighted, though her pal and bridesmaid Jennifer Aydin seems uncertain about the elaborate $10,000 style.  “Hair’s supposed to be an accent piece, not the main event,” Aydin, 46, quips in a confessional.  “Teresa Gets Married” premieres Tuesday, May 23, at 8 p.m. ET on Bravo.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vcGFnZXNpeC5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8xNi9sdWlzLXJ1ZWxhcy10aHJlYXRlbnMtdG8tYnVyeS1wZW9wbGUtaW4tdGVyZXNhLWdldHMtbWFycmllZC_SAV9odHRwczovL3BhZ2VzaXguY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTYvbHVpcy1ydWVsYXMtdGhyZWF0ZW5zLXRvLWJ1cnktcGVvcGxlLWluLXRlcmVzYS1nZXRzLW1hcnJpZWQvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Fire crews were called to the shed around 1 p.m. when the owner discovered the fire. The structure was engulfed in flames, but crews needed to take a very defensive attack due to the presence of fertilizers, pesticides and propane tanks.  Homes in the immediate area were evacuated because of the smoke created from the materials.  There were no injuries, but damages are estimated at $1-million.  Fire officials expect crews to be battling the fire for a lengthy period due to the presence of oxidizing materials and potentially explosive tanks.  Strathroy-Caradoc Fire Chief Brent Smith asked that the public stay away from Saxton Road since it is needed to run tanker shuttles to take down the fire and because of the unknown products within the smoke that is present.

The victim called police the next morning. Deputies observed video footage from the night before and saw the suspect cut open the toolbox in the truck bed, Cutting said.  Police are still investigating the incident.  ‘Explosion’ at high school  Sonoma police responded to a reported “explosion” at Sonoma Valley High School on Wednesday, May 10, likely stemming from a pyrotechnic device, Sonoma Police Chief Brandon Cutting said.  As deputies were responding to the incident, a fire alarm went off on another side of campus, but police are unsure if the two incidents were related, Cutting said. No evidence of an explosion was found on site, and no student could be identified.  No damage was reported and the incident is being handled by school officials, Cutting said.  Petty theft  As a Sonoma woman entered Whole Foods on May 10 around 4 p.m., she was confronted by a group of three strangers who worked together to steal her purse, Cutting said.  One of the suspects approached the woman and asked her for directions to Sonoma Valley Hospital while the other two took her purse, which contained credit cards and about $100 in cash, Cutting said. The cards were charged $500 shortly after at a nearby ATM.  Sonoma police believe the group is a part of a known theft ring in the Bay Area which previously stole items from Halem & Co. jewelry store, Cutting said. There are no leads at this point.  Hit and run  On May 13, Sonoma police responded to a reported hit and run on the 19000 block of Robinson Road.  Video footage near the incident showed a driver hit a parked Honda and continue driving. Deputies found the suspect’s unoccupied car near Verano Avenue and Main Street the next day, but were unable to find the driver, Cutting said.  Sonoma police are still searching for the suspect.  DUI  Police responded to a reported hit and run at 7:22 a.m. in the area of First Street West and Spain Street in downtown Sonoma on May 13.  A witness followed the suspect’s Nissan Xterra and called police, who quickly located the driver and conducted a traffic stop, Cutting said.  Deputies determined the 37-year-old Sonoma man was under the influence of alcohol. Deputies conducted a Breathalyzer test that showed the suspect had a BAC of 0.27 — more than three times the legal limit, Cutting said.  The suspect was arrested for misdemeanor DUI and hit and run, Cutting said.

St. John Bosco defensive back Jason Mitchell. Mitchell has several schools on his list and plans to take at least five if not more official trips this cycle. It sounds like many of those trips will come after he makes his decision.  We had a chance to catch up with Mitchell last week at the Braves College Showcase and he updated us on where his recruitment is at right now.  “I’m still set to commit Sept. 16 at the Kahuku (Hawaii) game,” Mitchell said. “I plan to take a few official trips in June and then the rest will be during the season.  “I think I’ll be able to take a few in-season before the Kahuku game and then I’ll do a few after that. You only go through this once and I really want to enjoy the recruiting process so I want to try and take as many trips as I can.”  The schools Mitchell mentioned who he’s hoping to visit include LSU, Notre Dame, Oregon, USC, Utah and Washington. He talked about what stands out with each program:  LSU: “LSU likes me as a corner and that’s where I enjoy playing. I’ll play anywhere but I like corner and LSU is one of those schools like Oregon and USC that I would call a childhood favorite. I always liked them growing up, they produce great defensive backs every year and get them drafted. I like their style of play, the SEC is a great conference so I’m excited to visit there on a game weekend.”  Notre Dame: “Notre Dame is on me really heavy and they’re recruiting me as an athlete right now. They feel I can play corner or safety and haven’t specified exactly where they like me, they said they just me and they’ll find a spot once I get there. I know a lot will depend on my frame and how big I get but I see a lot of opportunity at Notre Dame. They have a great staff in place with a great head coach who knows defense really well. I like how they’re recruiting me, and so, I’m excited for my visit and we still need to decide if that will in June or during the season.”  Oregon: “Oregon feels a lot like L.A .(Los Angeles) to me. I don’t mean the city as much as the people there. They have a lot of coaches that are from here and when I talk to them, it feels like home for sure. I love the vibe and the way I feel when I’m with those guys. They’re good coaches and quality people and I’ve always loved the Oregon program a lot.”  USC: “I mean, it’s USC. What else can I say? It’s the school I grew up watching, my dad played there, so I’ve always followed them. It’s a childhood favorite, but still, I have to pick the best school for me, not just who I liked when I was young. It’s a business decision, but saying that, I do like USC a lot and I’m really close with (defensive backs coach and defensive passing game coordinator) Donte (Williams) and the rest of the staff.”  Utah: “I’m going to visit Utah for sure during the season and the coaches gave me their schedule and I just have to pick a game. I love that staff and they show a lot of love. I talk with (special teams coordinator and cornerbacks) coach (Sharrieff) Shah, (defensive coordinator and safeties) coach (Morgan) Scalley, (head) coach (Kyle) Whit(tingham), and everyone there is so real and genuine. There’s nothing but great people at Utah and they’re all about development, so I really like them a lot.”  Get the latest football and basketball transfer portal news from 247Sports.  Washington: “I visited Washington with California Power (7v7 team) and loved it there. I like the coaching staff and the support system they have in place. It’s a great staff with (cornerbacks) coach (Julius) Juice (Brown) and (co-defensive coordinator and safeties) coach (Chuck) Morrell and I talk with (director of player personnel) Courtney Morgan, too.

Omaha Gross 5, Beatrice 2  Beatrice got on the board first on an RBI single by pitcher Deagan Nelson, but the Cougars capitalized on a couple of errors to take a 3-1 lead in the second inning. Colby Duncan reached first base on an error that scored Carson Almgren as Duncan collided with the Orangemen first baseman.  Owen Brennan then drove a fly ball to deep right, as Joshua Buhr made a good adjustment in right for the out, but Alex Kosse scored easily from third, and on an error on the throw to home, Duncan also scored.  An RBI single by Colby Duncan provided an insurance run in the top of the sixth.  ""We got some big at-bats,"" Gross head coach Jim Hempel said, after the Cougars followed a 13-run performance with five on Tuesday.  ""One through nine here for these last few games, we've had guys really locked in and they've been having good ABs. We talked about if we don't strike out, we put the ball in play, and hit a few hard, we're gonna win a lot of games because our defense is good and our pitching has been really good this year.""  Starting pitcher Joseph Rempe was pulled after 5.1 innings of one-run ball for Jack Miller with two runners on and one out in the bottom of the inning.  ""We told Joe we had to have him go deep into this game,"" Hempel said. ""He hadn't thrown this whole week, and he went out and gave us everything he had, just gutted it out. (He) gave up that early run and then just settled in which, that's been his career. He's beaten a lot of big teams over the last two years.""  Using a ""very manageable"" curveball, Rempe commanded the zone and put the Cougars in a position for Miller to come in and finish the win.  After getting a strikeout, Miller induced the final out to keep the Cougars lead at 4-1.  An Almgren sacrifice fly added some room to the Gross lead, but the drama didn’t end there in the seventh.  On a play at the plate, Rempe trucked into the Beatrice catcher Noah Jobman after running through third on a single to left, and was tossed from the game, igniting some shouts from both benches but without escalating further.  Rempe will miss the first game but not the second (if necessary) against Elkhorn North tomorrow.  ""Curious to see some video of that. So I wasn't real happy about that. I understand the out call but the ejection I thought was a little questionable with the catcher coming up the line in a split second. You don't have any options. You're gonna have contact in a play like that. So it's unfortunate that we will lose him for the first game.""  Miller shut the door in the bottom of the inning for a second straight Cougars win to earn his school record-tying fourth save of the season.  ""We didn't want anybody else out there other than Joe and then Jack Miller does what Jack does. He tied coach Peters' spring record for saves, and that was his fourth one today, and he's been wanting to get on the big board up at school, so that would be able to get him on. So he's pretty excited about that.""  Omaha Gross next plays Elkhorn North on Wednesday at 10 a.m. back at Fricke Field. A loss to the Wolves would end the season, while a win would set up a win-or-go-home for both teams, the winner advancing to the Class B state championship game on Friday at Tal Anderson Field at 4 p.m.  Om.

A bases-clearing double and three-run homer by Alex Draper provided the bulk of the offense for the Trojans in their second win of the state tournament to advance to face Malcolm for a second time at Millard North on Wednesday at 4 p.m.  After Draper emptied the bases in the second, Dezmond Straatman drove in two more with a single to right in the third, and the lead ballooned to seven as Draper was hit by pitch with the bases loaded.  Draper was then driven in on a sac fly by Nathan Thomas, and another from Keegan Stobbe scored the Trojans ninth run of the game.  The senior Trojan then effectively hit a walk-off three-run shot to right to earn Platteview a mercy-rule win.

As what’s really exciting is the potential of its Warhammer intellectual property.  Other fictional worlds like Star Wars, Marvel or Lord of the Rings have had outrageously successful – and lucrative – TV shows and movies.  And only last year, Amazon struck a deal with the firm to create a Warhammer series starring Henry Cavill.

Tesla  My second choice, electric vehicles (EV) manufacturer Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), needs little introduction.  The carmaker has already grown at a 40% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the last 10 years. That’s thanks to its success in producing desirable EVs, taking a 65% share of that market.  But its success does present an obvious question: is the growth phase already over?  Musk’s latest vision  Personally, I don’t think so. And the reason is its owner Elon Musk has a much grander vision. He wants Tesla to put self-driving vehicles on roads all around the world.  The company that introduces safe and effective autonomous vehicles will surely see huge growth. It’s like creating the same productivity as millions of taxis and lorry drivers in one fell swoop.  And Tesla looks well placed here. First off, the firm’s vertical integration – making its own batteries, having its own repairs, and the like – means the company trounces its competitors when it comes to margins.  Tesla Toyota Honda GM Ford Stellantis 2022 Net Margin 15.5% 6.9% 4.80% 6.20% -1.4% 9.2%  That’s a lot more cash to spend on research and testing its autonomous vehicles.  But also, Musk’s latest move was to slash thousands off the prices of his cars. By doing this, he thinks Tesla can gain further market share to give itself an untouchable advantage in self-driving technology.  For me, the biggest risk here is simply that other investors agree with me. Today’s share price of $172 bumps the price-to-earnings ratio up to an expensive-sounding 50.

While the pair returned to screens this week to host This Morning, reports have been circulating that Holly is looking to pull the plug on their TV partnership. On Monday, the stars managed to present the show with a smile, but many viewers spotted tension under the surface. But what are Holly and Phil actually rowing about and when did it begin? READ MORE: Holly and Phil's ‘awkward’ snap highlights backstage 'tension'  Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield returned to This Morning  After first working together back in 2006, Holly and Phillip have been best friends ever since. But despite appearing on the ITV daytime show together, reports surfaced the pair were ""barely speaking"" off camera. According to The Sun, following the ""Queue-gate"" scandal last year, Holly made it clear to ITV bosses that she would continue to host the show even if Phil leaves. It comes after the This Morning hosts faced backlash after thousands of mourners had to wait for up to 24 hours to pay their last respects to Her Majesty amid claims the presenters had skipped the queue.  Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield are close pals  Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield present Dancing On Ice  In a special pre-recorded message at the time, Holly and Phil said they ""would never skip the queue"" and were given special broadcast access. Reports later suggested their friendship had ""cooled off"" in recent months. Last week a source told The Sun that while they are ""putting on smiles"" for the show, there are ""naturally some tensions"". “This has been brewing quietly for some time"", the source told the publication: ""But now it’s all out in the open and people are talking about it. There is no getting past it.""  Holly Willoughby joined This Morning in 2006  Following these reports, Phillip released a statement to the same publication where he referred to Holly as his ""best friend"". It read: “As I have said before, Holly is my rock. We’re the best of friends — as always, she is an incredible support on screen, behind the scenes and on the phone. ""Holly has always been there for me, through thick and thin. And I’ve been there for her. The last few weeks haven’t been easy for either of us.” After Phillip released a statement regarding his friendship with Holly, calling her his ""rock"", sources claimed the mother-of-three was ""blindsided"" by the message which she knew nothing about.

Besides, some of the altcoins like Polkadot appear to be preparing for a massive explosion that may raise the levels beyond a 2-digit figure.  The crypto space is maintaining a choppy trend as the prices of the major tokens have been hovering within a very narrow range. Besides, one of the popular altcoins is displaying acute strength as it has been accumulating for the past few weeks. The Polkadot price is currently testing one of the crucial supports and is believed to rebound and reach a 2-digit figure soon.  The Polkadot price, similar to the other tokens within the markets, has maintained a healthy upswing since the beginning of the year. After the remarkable drop, the price is now heading towards the critical levels that may offer a required bounce to rebound and rise above the bearish influence.  DOT price currently appears to be in a group of leaders who are primed to break out from the prolonged downward trend. After a 2-month rise, the Polkadot price surged by nearly 100% and quickly dropped into a deep consolidation for the 3rd month. Therefore, the DOT price cannot continue to fall until it holds the critical levels at $4.83.  Moreover, if Elliot wave analysis is done on the current trade setup, then wave 2 is very close to completion. Therefore, the next wave could be an upward wave that may lift the price towards the upper targets at around $10 to $10.5 initially. However, an extended bullish trend may lift the price close to $12.30.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vY29pbnBlZGlhLm9yZy9wcmljZS1hbmFseXNpcy9iaXRjb2luLWZsYXNoZXMtYmVhcmlzaC1zaWduYWxzLXdoaWxlLXRoaXMtYWx0Y29pbi1pcy1yZWFkeS10by1leHBsb2RlL9IBcGh0dHBzOi8vY29pbnBlZGlhLm9yZy9wcmljZS1hbmFseXNpcy9iaXRjb2luLWZsYXNoZXMtYmVhcmlzaC1zaWduYWxzLXdoaWxlLXRoaXMtYWx0Y29pbi1pcy1yZWFkeS10by1leHBsb2RlL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Insider spoke with three Marines and a Diplomatic Security Service official about closing the post.  They described the rush to leave Sudan, which involved destroying documents and lowering the flag.  Top editors give you the stories you want — delivered right to your inbox each weekday.

Christopher Wolfert watched plumes of smoke rising in the distance amid the booms of exploding mortars and cracks of machine-gun fire in Sudan's capital.  It was Saturday, April 22. The US Marine Security Guard was protecting the American embassy in Khartoum, which had been engulfed by deadly violence for a week at that point. As the situation deteriorated, the Pentagon dispatched Special Operations Forces to evacuate US diplomatic staff in a dramatic helicopter operation. A little under 100 people were rescued from the US embassy compound in just under an hour on the ground.  As Navy SEALs and Army Special Forces rushed in, Sudan's capital was spiraling toward civil war. Tensions between rival powers had finally boiled over, and street fights raged.  ""It was audible and visual,"" Wolfert later said, referring to the fighting nearby. ""The evacuation itself — fairly surreal.""  Wolfert is one of a dozen Marines whose detachment was assigned to guard the US embassy in Africa's third-largest country and one of three Marines that Insider spoke to, along with an official from the Diplomatic Security Service, an agency under the State Department, about the April 22 drawdown and evacuation of America's diplomatic outpost in Sudan.  The men Insider spoke with described scenes of chaos outside the embassy walls and a rush inside to quickly close up shop and get out of Sudan, from destroying sensitive national security information to lowering the American flag. It wasn't what anyone had wanted to see happen.  ""Unfortunately, we really didn't have a choice,"" Staff Sgt. Derek Ferrari, the detachment commander, told Insider. ""When it was time to leave, it was time to leave.""  Smoke is seen in Khartoum, Sudan, Wednesday, April 19, 2023. AP Photo/Marwan Ali, File  Fighting in Sudan first broke out on April 15 when clashes erupted between forces loyal to Gen. Abdel Fattah al Burhan, commander of the Sudanese army, and Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, who leads the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The two have been competing for power ever since they orchestrated a 2021 military coup together.  Within days, violence quickly gripped the country, killing hundreds of people and injuring thousands more. Foreign governments began efforts to pull out their diplomatic staff and, in some cases, also moved to evacuate their civilians.  At one point, armed fighters even opened fire on a clearly marked US embassy convoy that had identification plates and an American flag. No one was hurt, but Secretary of State Antony Blinken slammed the incident as ""reckless"" and ""irresponsible."" By April 20, US forces had been deployed to positions near Sudan in case they had to quickly extract diplomatic staff.  Though there were signs, the Marines didn't know for sure an evacuation was coming, but it's something that they were ready for. It is something they prepare and train for. ""It's not likely to happen,"" Ferrari said. ""But you need to be ready if it does.""  A symbolic moment  Marine Security Guards are a 24-hour presence at US embassies around the world, and their mission is to protect classified information, US government personnel, and the physical facility. At any given diplomatic post, the Marines work under regional security officers (RSOs) from the Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) — the ambassador's security and law enforcement advisors.  The Marine Security Guard Detachment assigned to the US Embassy in Khartoum, Sudan, stand for a photo in front of McMaugh Hall at Marine Corps Embassy Security Group Headquarters, Quantico, Va., on April 24. US Marine Corps courtesy photo  ""We could not do what we do overseas without Marine Security Guards,"" DSS Deputy Assistant Director Thad Osterhout told Insider. Marine Sgt. Nicholas Bonasera said ""they take care of us as we take care of them.""  Security officers train to handle a wide range of scenarios, such as intruders at the embassy, medical issues, and bomb threats, as well as emergency embassy evacuations and shutdowns.  ""There are some things that are out of your control,"" Ferrari said, but this is why they train. When the Marines learned the embassy had to be evacuated, they sprang into action to start shutting it down.  A flag-lowering ceremony takes place at the US embassy in Khartoum before it is evacuated. Gen. David H. Berger via Twitter  One order of business was lowering the American flag. All the Marines who weren't occupied with other security-related jobs at the moment took part in a ceremony that involved lowering the flag and presenting it to the ambassador, John Godfrey.  ""The American flag represents our footprint in that country and everything that the American people are bringing to that country through our diplomatic channels,"" Ferrari said. ""There's symbolism in lowering the flag.""  A flag-lowering ceremony at the US embassy in Khartoum. Gen. David H. Berger via Twitter  Getting people as violence gripped the capital  Before the evacuation could take place, all the diplomatic staff had to be consolidated at the embassy, which is one large compound protected by a wall. But US government personnel were scattered several miles away across Khartoum in a separate main housing compound and several auxiliary compounds.  Osterhout said DSS special agents had to slip outside the embassy and rescue people as fighting raged throughout the city. Sometimes, they had to wait until a safe window opened up so they could move people back to the embassy. In other cases, agents had to make multiple attempts to retrieve people who were staying temporarily at hotels.  People walk by a house hit in recent fighting in Khartoum, Sudan, Tuesday, April 25, 2023. AP Photo/Marwan Ali  Consolidating everyone in one location ""was critically important for our Department of Defense partners,"" Osterhout said. ""Had the DOD evacuation force had to go to more than one location in a city under the conditions Khartoum was in, [it] would've both complicated their planning and execution, but it also would've entailed significantly more risk.""  Outside the embassy walls, there was a lot of confusion on the ground, with poor command and control from the top down on behalf of both warring parties. Osterhout said that while the US was ""confident"" the embassy would not be specifically targeted by senior leadership on either side, there was no assurance that local fighters would avoid this.  DSS Deputy Assistant Director Thad Osterhout (far right) and other DSS leadership, alongside interagency partners, closely monitored the departure from Khartoum from the DSS Command Center in Arlington, VA on April 22, 2023 US Department of State photo  Moving about Khartoum meant traveling in a contested environment, one in which an American could easily end up in the wrong place at the wrong time. At least two Americans have been killed since the fighting began.  Osterhout said there were ""significant concerns"" that low-level forces may seize an opportunity to hold up an embassy convoy or try to gain access to a housing compound, rather than the embassy itself. Osterhout said the embassy is a ""very hard target"" because the Marines guarding the facility are a ""very effective deterrent.""  During the evacuation preparations, the Marines had to protect the national security information at the embassy, which meant safeguarding and destroying sensitive equipment and classified information. Doing this meant balancing available manpower because the Marines had to continue guarding the building like they would normally on a round-the-clock basis and also staff various security posts.  Though fighting was happening in the immediate vicinity of the embassy, neither the Sudanese army nor the RSF were intentionally trying to attack the embassy, Ferrari said. Still, there was a lot of indirect fire and ordnance being thrown around in the surrounding areas.  ""You could see and smell and hear everything around you that could at any time ... have been a great threat to the embassy, whether it was intentional or unintentional,"" he added.  Evacuating the embassy  Fighting like this can always threaten air operations, but when President Joe Biden gave the orders to evacuate the embassy in Khartoum, it signaled that Washington was willing to take that risk.  At 9 a.m. EST on April 22, three MH-47 Chinook rotary aircraft took off from Djibouti and stopped to refuel in neighboring Ethiopia before flying another three hours to Khartoum. As is standard practice for diplomatic outposts, the embassy had a pre-designated landing zone in an open field around 500 feet outside the southern entrance to the compound.  Even as the evacuation unfolded, the Marines were constantly busy conducting their standard operating procedures, as they had been since the moment the conflict broke out. They manned the security posts until the very last hour, at which point they had to be shut down.  DSS Deputy Assistant Director Thad Osterhout (far left) and other DSS leadership, alongside interagency partners, closely monitored the departure from Khartoum from the DSS Command Center in Arlington, VA on April 22, 2023. US Department of State photo  Physically moving dozens of personnel from the embassy to the helicopters fell entirely on the responsibility of the more than 100 US troops — all Special Operations Forces — who had flown into Khartoum that day. Once the Marines and diplomatic staff were loaded up onto the helicopters, the mission was complete.  ""The evacuation was conducted in one movement via rotary wing,"" Lt. Gen. D.A. Sims, director of operations for the Joint Staff, told reporters later that day. ""The operation was fast and clean, with service members spending less than an hour on the ground in Khartoum.""  The Marines said that departing Sudan was a ""bittersweet"" moment. There was a sense of sadness to leave behind their Sudanese colleagues and the friends they had made in the country, yet there was also a feeling of satisfaction in knowing that they did their duties.  ""Even though it's seems like we're leaving our diplomatic footprint behind in Sudan, we were leaving with all the personnel that we were supposed to,"" Ferrari noted. ""No one had been killed, no one had been seriously injured, everybody had been evacuated safely. So that is a successful mission as a whole — that is something that no one should be sad or upset about.""  ""Our job is to protect the embassy,"" Wolfert said. ""We had done our jobs well.""  US Mission personnel assigned to the US Embassy in Khartoum, Sudan, embrace each other upon their safe return to the United States at Dulles International Airport, Va., on April 24. US Marine Corps courtesy photo  With the embassy staff gone, questions remained over whether Washington would move to evacuate US citizens, as some other Western nations had been doing. At one point, the State Department and the Pentagon organized a land convoy — with drone support overhead — to bring Americans to a part city along the Red Sea, where they could then travel onward to Saudi Arabia. Naval support had also been moved into the region.  Meanwhile, fighting in Sudan shows no signs of slowing down, and civilians continue to pay the ultimate price. According to United Nations estimates, over 600 people have been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have either become internally displaced or fled the country.  Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organization, warned last week that the violence is crippling the country at an economic and social level.  ""As well as facing shelling and insecurity, people are dealing with dwindling supplies of water, food, medicines, and electricity,"" he said. ""Establishing safe routes for humanitarian aid is critical. But the ultimate solution is peace.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vZXZhY3VhdGlvbi11cy1lbWJhc3N5LXN1ZGFuLXN1cnJvdW5kZWQtZ3Vucy1leHBsb3Npb25zLXN0cmVldC1maWdodGluZy0yMDIzLTXSAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL2V2YWN1YXRpb24tdXMtZW1iYXNzeS1zdWRhbi1zdXJyb3VuZGVkLWd1bnMtZXhwbG9zaW9ucy1zdHJlZXQtZmlnaHRpbmctMjAyMy01P2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

After years of explosive growth during the pandemic, Home Depot’s revenue during the first quarter fell short of expectations and the company cut its profit and sales outlook for the year, sending shares skidding before the opening bell Tuesday.  It was a rough start to a busy week of retail earnings and the numbers from the nation’s biggest home improvement chain dragged down retails stocks as well as the Dow.  Advertisement  For the three months ended April 30, revenue dropped to $37.26 billion from last year’s $38.91 billion, and it was short of the $38.45 billion projected by analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research.  Sales at stores open at least a year, a key indicator of a retailer’s health, dropped 4.5%, and it dropped 4.6% for stores in the U.S.  Advertisement  “After a three-year period of unprecedented growth for our sector, during which we grew sales by over $47 billion, we expected that fiscal 2023 would be a year of moderation for the home improvement market,” said CEO Ted Decker.  Decker said weak sales were mostly due to lumber deflation and bad weather, particularly in its Western division which had to contend with extreme weather in California.  But the Atlanta company cut its expectations for the year with as shift in spending becomes more clear with the economy slowing and costs rising for builders and homeowners.  The U.S. Federal Reserve has hiked benchmark interest rates 10 consecutive times with hopes of slowing the economy and cooling inflation.  The U.S. economy slowed sharply from January through March, decelerating to just a 1.1% annual pace as higher interest rates hammered the housing market and businesses reduced their inventories. An estimate from the Commerce Department last month showed that the nation’s gross domestic product — the broadest gauge of economic output — weakened after growing 3.2% from July through September and 2.6% from October through December.  Home Depot cautioned in February that it expected profits to slip this year. The chain saw remarkable growth over the past three years, as many people hunkered down at home or were searching for a new home during the pandemic. Americans spent heavily on home renovations and other projects.  With the easing of the pandemic, Americans began to spend on things that had faded in recent years, like dinners out and vacations.  Home Depot earned $3.87 billion, or $3.82 per share, in the quarter. A year earlier it earned $4.23 billion, or $4.09 per share. That was better than the per-share earnings of $3.80 that industry analysts were expecting.  Advertisement  Home Depot Inc. now expects sales and same-store sales to decline between 2% and 5% this year. Several months ago, the company said it expected sales to be flat compared with 2022.  The chain now expects full-year earnings to fall between 7% and 13%, expanding the potential decline from earlier expectations that the retreat would remain solidly in the single-digit percentage range.

For context, it was at that time that bands like ESG and Liquid Liquid existed at the forefront of the Disco Punk frontier, mixing No Wave, Disco and Post-Punk sounds to craft an entirely new genre for music. DJ Kool Herc, meanwhile, was building the foundation for breakdancing, and Blondie had just put out Parallel Lines.  In the art scene, Keith Haring had just set up shop in the Lower East Side, while Jean-Michel Basquiat and Al Diaz were tagging Manhattan under their SAMO alter-ego. “It was a mythical time for art and music in the city,” as the brand puts it.  Referencing the era through clothes, YMC is celebrating ’70s New York’s breakthroughs with clashing colors, military surplus references and arty prints. Cotton ripstop, leaf print camouflages and field jackets in soft twill nod to the army-inspired silhouettes of the time, while shirting appears inspired by Basquiat’s legendary works. The color palette, which largely consists of washed blue, black, ecru, red, brown and royal blue, is just as much a sign of the times.  The brand’s signature pieces, like the Bowie shirt, arrive with fresh New York-inspired patterns. The PJ Overshirt is made from a delicate Broaderie Anglais; the Walker Jacket enlists a pre-washed dye, and the Battle Jacket dons a military-inspired brown facade. Clashing colors, as mentioned, appear in stripes on the Bluebird Dress and Rat Pack Cardigan, referencing the “anarchic spirit” that defined the period.  YMC’s Pre-Fall 2023 collection is now available to shop on the brand’s webstore. Revel in the range in the gallery above.

Explosion of a missile is seen in the sky over the city during a Russian missile strike in Kyiv, Ukraine May 16, 2023.  Kyiv was targeted by 18 different missiles in a “pretty intense” attack overnight, according to Ukraine – but officials managed to shoot them all down.  According to the country’s authorities, at least three people were injured in the assault from both drones and missiles.  It came just as Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy concluded his European tour where he was asking Western allies for greater military support against Russia – and received substantial pledges for more funding and equipment.  The first air raid alert went off at 2.30am local time (11.30pm GMT) and only ceased two hours later.  This was the eighth time the capital has been targeted by missiles this month alone, following a 50-day pause on the attacks.  Moscow has increased its attacks against Ukraine in recent weeks while bracing itself for Kyiv’s counteroffensive.  But, this series of missiles was particularly devastating, because Kyiv was attacked from the north, south and east with 18 air, sea and land-based missiles.  Miraculously though, no fatalities have been reported yet.  Still, as the British ambassador to Ukraine, Dame Melinda Simmons, tweeted: “A full on aerial attack on Kyiv last night, pretty intense.  “Bangs and shaking walls are not an easy night. Hope everyone is OK.”  A full on aerial attack on Kyiv last night, pretty intense. Bangs and shaking walls are not an easy night. Hope everyone is ok. — Dame Melinda Simmons (@MelSimmonsFCDO) May 16, 2023  The head of the Ukrainian capital’s military administration, Serhiy Popko, also said the attack was “the maximum number of attack missiles in the shortest period of time”.  But, he said “preliminary information” shows most of these were “destroyed”, leaving rocket debris across the city.  Story continues  Six of the missiles were allegedly Kinzhal hypersonic missiles – those which exceed the speed of sound by five times – which Moscow previously claimed could not be defeated by any air defence system.  Officials think Moscow wants to exhaust Ukraine’s air defence systems through its barrage of attacks.  Here’s a round-up of what the overnight attack looked like in photos:  The picture shows an explosion over Kyiv during a Russian missile strike early on May 16, 2023.

"explosion","2011-08-11","11:00:00","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 15:00:00","asbe  Approximately 12 years ago, I wrote my first public market prognostication and it was focused on gold. At the time, gold was enjoying a parabolic rally, and the discussion amongst the general public was how far past the $2,000 mark gold was going to strike during that rally.  So, on Aug. 11, 2011, I concluded my first gold article on Seeking Alpha as follows:  ""Again, since we are most probably in the final stages of this parabolic fifth wave ""blow-off-top,"" I would seriously consider anything approaching the $1,915 level to be a potential target for a top at this time.""  Needless to say, my first market prognostication was not met with tremendous support. These are a sample of the comments I received from Seeking Alpha readers when I was calling for a metals market top:  ""With all due respect Avi, you plainly do NOT understand the gold market."" ""Your TA is useless. You don't understand the fundamentals because you only look to the past. Gold bulls are forward thinking. The times they are a changing..."" ""The problem is that TA is like driving a car by only looking in the rear view mirror... There is no foresight involved; it's all based on past performance. The future of the fundamentals is what you fail to grasp."" ""There is no way you can understand what is going on in gold by doing technical analysis. Gold is driven by fundamentals."" ""Technical analyses is all well and good, but you cannot apply it to the PM sector which has been artificially manipulated and suppressed for years.""  Yet, as we now know, gold struck a top within $6 of the top for which I was calling.  What many may have seen as either ignorance or hubris, I even provided my downside target even before gold topped, wherein I explained my expectation for gold to drop back down to the $1,000 region.  ""Based upon the Elliott Wave Principle, I would expect a very large pullback. In fact, the target for such a pullback will probably be a minimum low of $1,400, it could fall as low as $1,000, or even as low as $700. It will depend upon how the decline takes form. But those are very viable targets for gold on the downside.""  And, the comments regarding my views were basically the same as above, so, I will just note one of the more ""reasonable"" comments:  ""There is no way to rationalize $700 gold with 50% debasement of currency expected over the next 5 years as US debt grows to $21 trillion from $14. It makes no sense to my feeble mind. I vote for $3000 vs. $1900 today. That makes sense to my mind.""  As you can see, it was quite clear at the time that the ""fundamentals"" were keeping most metals bulls looking to the long side. And, amazingly, those same fundamentals kept the metals bulls looking to the long side of the market during the entire decline.  ElliottWaveTrader.net  But what was truly amazing was that as gold was approaching its long-term low struck at the end of 2015, almost the entire market turned bearish and was again ""certain"" that it would continue in its downside trajectory (just as strongly as they were certain we would eclipse $2,000 in 2011), with most now turning from bullish to predicting a drop below $1,000.  Well, just like everyone was uber-bullish at the highs when we expected a major top, we turned bullish when everyone turned uber-bearish. On Dec. 30, 2015, I urged investors to be moving back into the metals complex as we were looking for a long-term bottom to be struck imminently due to the significant bearishness evident in the market:  ""As we move into 2016, I believe there is a greater than 80% probability that we finally see a long-term bottom formed in the metals and miners and the long term bull market resumes. Those who followed our advice in 2011, and moved out of this market for the correction we expected, are now moving back into this market as we approach the long term bottom. In 2011, before gold even topped, we set our ideal target for this correction in the $700-$1,000 region in gold. We are now reaching our ideal target region, and the pattern we have developed over the last four years is just about complete... For those interested in my advice, I would highly suggest you start moving back into this market with your long term money...""  In fact, back in September 2015, and when the metals mining companies were absolutely hated by the investor community, I rolled out a service on ElliottWaveTrader specifically to focus on the mining industry. We began urging our clients to buy mining stocks during the last quarter of 2015. In fact, I bought stocks such as Newmont Mining (NEM) in the $15-17 region at the time. And, NEM was my largest holding in the complex since that time.  Now, fast-forward to 2022, and gold had been stuck in a correction since a local top was struck back in August 2020. Yet, there were pockets within the market which still rallied into 2022.  An example of such outperformance in 2022 included NEM, which went on to strike higher highs in April 2022. Yet, when NEM struck the 84-85 region, I outlined to the members of The Market Pinball Wizard that, for the first time since I bought NEM in 2015, I was selling almost my entire holdings in the company. You see, I set a target of 82-89 when NEM was hovering in the 28 region. And, when we moved into my target region, I stuck with my plan and sold my largest holding in the complex. Since that time, NEM dropped 57% off its highs.  So, back in January, I provided my latest assessment of the gold market, with an expectation for gold to rally to the $2,428 region in this current move off the early November low. I also noted that we can certainly even blow through that, depending upon the extensions we see in the upcoming rally, but that target was a solid one for now. Clearly, I will reassess the target once the next bullish phase begins in earnest.  And, then in April, I outlined my expectation for the metals market to begin its next rally to the $2,200-plus region. My expectation was that a break-out through $2,075 would trigger that next bigger move. Yet, while the market spiked to $2,085 in early May, I warned members of The Market Pinball Wizard that the structure of that move did not look like it was starting that rally to $2,200 just yet, and I expected more of a pullback. So, while the market did spike through $2,075, it clearly was not able to sustain that rally, as we expected, and it immediately spiked back down below.  At this time, I'm still expecting a fast and strong rally to $2,200-plus in the coming months. And a break-out over $2,085 will likely now be the trigger.  But silver is providing to us a relatively low risk buying opportunity as it's setting up to see a very strong upside follow through when this pullback completes.  To keep it very simple, we have been outlining to the members our expectation for the pullback we're now seeing in silver, and it's now striking our general target region for this expected pullback. As long as silver holds over $22.50, I'm expecting this pullback to complete over the coming week or two and set us up for a strong rally which should be pointing us north of 27 rather quickly.

"explosion","2023-09-12","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 03:03:00","Population Explosion. Pix:Twitter  International concerns about Nigeria’s high fertility rate calls for a deeper reflection on our national demography and its implications. Clearly, Nigeria’s bourgeoning young population is a potential national asset and the envy of the developed nations.  But without a clear-cut plan for their general well-being, especially quality education and job opportunities, the future is bleak and a reason to rue high fertility.  Globally, population is one of those indices through which nations are measured for their strength or the lack of it. Population strength is as potent as the economic power of a country, its political influence and military might in the comity of nations. And closely tied to population is the average fertility rate that obtains from one country to the other.  Given the significance, a recent global ranking placed Nigeria as the 8th most fertile country in the world, and in an odd category crowded by fellow African countries. Notably, Nigeria and the likes have continued to increase global population at a time the world is slowing down and has recorded a 50 per cent drop in fertility. According to the report published by Daily Mail UK, the global average number of children born to each woman is now 2.3, compared to 4.7 in 1970.  While swathes of Europe and North America are recording less than two births per woman on the average, Africa is leading with Somalia (6.4), Chad (6.4), The Democratic Republic of the Congo (6.2), Mali (6.0), the Central African Republic (6.0), Angola (5.4), Nigeria (5.3), Burundi (5.2) and Benin (5.1). The case of Nigeria already stands out for analysts, given the estimated population (without an actual headcount though) in excess of 206 million people – and the seventh most populous country in the world.  Indeed, the debate on values of a large population is not new. In fact, there are two broad schools of thought regarding population and development. Population might be a demographic dividend or a demographic disaster. That is, it could be a great economic, political and social asset, if well harnessed. Otherwise, it is a liability and time bomb of incalculable destruction waiting to happen.  The Malthusian argument of finite resources already forewarned the negative impact of overpopulation, which includes high-level unemployment, hunger, food crisis, and crime rates – and other social ills that are now self-evident in Nigeria and part of the African continent. Again, an unwieldy and poorly managed population increases the number of out-of-school children, which the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) already pegs at 18.5 million in Nigeria alone.  In addition, is fiery competition for scarce resources and seething social tension, coupled with poor access to healthcare, education and general sense of despondency. Not far-fetched in that setting is overcrowding, depletion of natural resources, and environmental degradation.  Population, vis-à-vis available resources, already places Nigeria in a dire strait. Hence, the need to be wary of unbridled population spikes. Because the socio-political and economic structures prevalent in a society are usually the deciding factor of population policy, concerned stakeholders have consistently said that the very low level of Nigeria’s utilisation of available resources has set the country up for minimal population growth rate – if it must avert disaster.  So, population growth must slow down until Nigeria gets the socioeconomic parameters right. Therefore, at present, the political office holders need to stabilise the political economy, come up and enforce a policy that will keep the population within manageable limits; not discounting civic education to show down the birth rate.  On the flip side of the narrative, however, the population positivists argue that a large demography is not the problem per se, but for the poor management of its potential. They argued that declining fertility rates could lead to a stagnant population, which is crippling many advanced economies and overwhelming public support systems.  Currently, falling fertility rates mean nearly every country could have shrinking populations by the end of the century. No fewer than 23 nations – including Spain and Japan – are expected to see their populations halve by 2100. Researchers at the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation also showed the global fertility rate nearly halved to 2.4 in 2017 – and their study projects it will fall below 1.7 by the turn of this century. The implication is that countries will also age dramatically, with as many people turning 80 as there are being born.  On the contrary, Nigeria’s rapidly growing population is giving life to the baby food market and industries. According to a research firm, the Nigerian baby food market has a promising future and is expected to reach over N200 billion by 2023 on the back of high birth rate and fertility rate. While the multinational companies (MNCs) are already enjoying steady patronage from the Nigerian baby food market, the market remains an untapped opportunity for Nigerians.

The Upper Big Branch Mine disaster is known as the second deadliest coal mine disaster in the U.S. It happened on April 5, 2010, at the Upper Branch Montcoal Eagle Mine, about 30 miles south of the West Virginia state capital of Charleston.  At 3:27 p.m. that afternoon, miners were working 1,000 feet underground when a massive explosion rocked the mine. It was later determined that the blast was caused by a build-up of methane gas and coal dust, the U.S. Department of Labor’s Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) reported.  Article continues below advertisement  Initially, 25 miners were killed, and four were missing after the blast. The four missing were found dead in the mine four days later. 28 of the dead were employees of Massey Energy, the company that owned the mine, and one miner was a contractor, The New York Times reported in 2010.  Source: Getty Images  Article continues below advertisement  Did anyone survive the Upper Big Branch Mine explosion?  Nine miners survived the UBB mine disaster. Survivor Stanely Stewart, who was 300 to 400 feet underground when the explosion happened, told ABC News that he struggled through “hurricane-force” winds and flying debris to get out of the mine.  Survivor James Woods was one of nine miners traveling in an underground vehicle on their way out of the mine at the time of the explosion. The blast killed seven of those in the vehicle, and Woods was pulled out of the mine barely alive, the Associated Press reported. Woods’s son, Jeremy, also worked in the mine and survived the blast.

As years passed, she felt like a burden and a useless mother to her family. When she attends Mass or walks outside, people would look at her with derision.  People would mock her saying, “Here comes the cripple.” Josie said it pains her to hear those words.  “I wanted to escape. I wanted to end my suffering. But in a fleeting moment, I thought of my family. ‘What will happen to my children? My husband?’” she was quoted in the ICRC report.  With all those struggles she faced, her husband was her biggest supporter. She felt love and kept going with her life despite all the mockery and gossip she hears.  In 2018, a social worker mentioned that the Davao Jubilee Foundation (DJF) has a program that helps people who were victims of armed conflict.  Josie in front of her newly constructed store. Photo: I. Ali/ICRC  The DJF program strives to make a positive impact on the lives of people affected by armed conflicts. Through this initiative, individuals in need receive specially crafted devices designed to enhance their mobility and independence. The ICRC supports the DJF’s physical rehabilitation services as well as donations for food and transportation for the beneficiaries.  Josie was told that she would no longer have to use crutches if she uses an orthoprosthesis. She was uncertain about that suggestion but she gave it a try and visited the DJF’s office.  After being fitted and learning how to walk with the orthoprosthesis, Josie’s life slowly came back to what it used to be.  The orthoprosthesis, according to the ICRC, serves as an attachment to Josie’s shorter leg, giving her equal footing with the good leg. This secures her balance with both feet planted on the ground, eliminating the need for crutches and ultimately enabling Josie to do the things she loves with ease.  Years after bearing with all the discrimination and mockery of other people, her wish to walk the way she walked before came true. With the help of DJF and ICRC, she is ready to face the world more confidently without thinking about what people might say about her. She is thankful for the support given to her.  Josie now owns a small sari-sari store which she started through ICRC’s micro economic initiatives project—providing productive grants to affected Mindanawons to start or revive their own business.  Now, her only wish is to walk up the stage and proudly hang a medal on her son without the crutches she’s been using for the past years.  “I have nothing to leave to them but their education. I encouraged my son, who is a consistent honor student, to keep up his good work. It is my dream to go up on stage for his graduation. Before, every time he received an award, I refused to go on stage because of my crutches. Now, I want to go on stage without it,” she said.

Essex Police received a report that a previous occupant, who had been evicted, was allegedly trying to gain access to their old property in Southend on July 22 2021.  The man was known to police on duty, as he had been released from prison that morning after receiving a custodial sentence for assaulting a police officer.  They were aware the individual had been evicted while in prison, and therefore should not be able to access the property.  READ MORE: Three people taken to hospital after crash involving four vehicles on A127  For this reason, PC Sam Hilbery, PC Joe Farrow and two other colleagues all attended.  PC Hilbery and PC Farrow arrived and were informed the suspect might be in a nearby van. As they approached the van, PC Farrow tried to open the back door while PC Hilbery looked through the window.  Suddenly the van exploded, causing PC Hilbery to be thrown back by the blast. She sustained severe burns and had glass embedded in her face and upper torso.  PC Farrow moved PC Hilbery away from further danger and provided initial first aid.  Colleagues started looking for the suspect, with all available units at Southend Police Station making their way to the scene.  He was located within the vehicle and officers got him out to a place of safety, before placing him under arrest.  PC Farrow made surrounding occupants aware of the situation, activating his vehicle siren and lights to draw people's attention, before directing them to a safe place.  Three other officers, including Sgt Katy Major, arrived within minutes and helped him evacuate the whole street.  Sgt Major took control of the scene and ensured roadblocks were put in once the area was cleared.  PC Hilbery was being tended to by PC Steve Martin and PC Garry Neal.  They stripped off her burned clothing and poured water over her to reduce the burns.  Story continues  Sgt Major directed the rest of her team to bang on doors to get more water, for both PC Hilbery and for the suspect, who was also injured and receiving first aid.  Paramedics arrived, took over first aid and conveyed PC Hilbery to the hospital. The paramedics praised the officers on scene, whose quick actions ""undoubtedly"" lessened the severity of PC Hilbery’s burns.  PC Martin said: “We heard officers going to an incident which didn’t seem overly serious… And then the next thing we heard was an emergency call… over the radio, all you could make out was there’d been an explosion and someone was hurt.  “On that particular scene, because I knew that a police officer had been hurt, there’s a lot of confusion, people are quite upset with what’s going on, and then when you’re seeing a colleague being brought towards you, clearly in pain, it’s a bit of a cliché but the training did take over in terms of the medical treatment we gave her.  “It’s good to see that the training we had meant that we could minimise any injuries to Sam and that she remains a police officer doing the job for the people of Essex.”  The suspect went to court but was found not guilty of any offences.  Essex Police Federation Chair Laura Heggie said: “All of the officers who attended this incident showed great professionalism and initiative, in what was a very traumatic and stressful situation. Together they were able to detain the suspect, secure the scene, protect the public, and ensure that PC Hilbery was given the best care possible.  “Seeing a colleague in pain is a distressing experience for everyone, but these officers were able to remain calm and composed. They should all be very proud of their brave and exemplary actions.”  The officers will attend the Essex Police Federation Bravery Awards on Thursday (May 18).  At the event a winner will be announced who will travel to London for the National Police Federation Bravery Awards in July.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vdWsuc3BvcnRzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL2JyYXZlLXBvbGljZS1hY3RlZC1mYXN0LXNvdXRoZW5kLTEzMDc0NzAzMy5odG1s0gFYaHR0cHM6Ly91ay5zcG9ydHMueWFob28uY29tL2FtcGh0bWwvbmV3cy9icmF2ZS1wb2xpY2UtYWN0ZWQtZmFzdC1zb3V0aGVuZC0xMzA3NDcwMzMuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Owners will receive notification of the recall beginning June 26, 2023, according to the recall notice. Licensed GM dealers will provide complimentary replacement of the front driver’s side airbag module with a new inflator.  For more information, owners can contact Buick customer service at 1-800-521-7300, Chevrolet customer service at 1-800-222-1020, or GMC customer service at 1-800-462-8782 and reference GM’s recall number N232404980.  ARC Automotive Inflator Recall Requested by NHTSA  Officials have called for ARC Automotive to issue a recall for approximately 67 million air bag inflators, following reports of the air bags exploding, sending sharp metal fragments and debris at the vehicle’s occupants. They provided detailed reports of the airbags rupturing and causing injuries to consumers in the airbag recall request to ARC.  NHTSA officials have been independently investigating the safety of airbags manufactured by ARC Automotive since August of 2016, after receiving multiple reports of consumers sustaining severe injuries to their head, face, and legs, as well as at least one fatality that resulted from a ruptured airbag.  After initiating an investigating into the exploding airbags, the agency concluded that a defect in the manufacturing process of the airbag inflators contributed to a blockage of the inflator. The blockage, which occurred as a byproduct of welding during manufacturing of the inflator, can cause over pressurization, which can then overinflate and rupture the airbag, resulting in an explosion of metal debris into the vehicle’s passenger compartment.  ARC Automotive maintains that a defect is not present in their airbag inflators. Despite the potentially significant and unreasonable safety risks the inflators pose to consumers, ARC has not cooperated with the agency in issuing a safety recall, which has prompted several automobile manufacturers to issue recalls of their own, impacting thousands of vehicles.  To date, General Motors has now issued five separate recalls since 2018, affecting model year 2010 through 2011 Chevrolet Malibu vehicles, model year 2008 through 2017 Buick Enclave, GMC Acadia, and Chevrolet Traverse vehicles equipped with airbag inflators manufactured by ARC.  In addition, BMW issued a recall in 2017 of their model year 2017 X5 sDrive35i, X5 xDrive35i, X5 xDrive50i, X5 xDrive35d, and X5 xDrive40e vehicles, Ford issued a recall in 2017 of their model year Mustang and F-150 pickup vehicles, while Volkswagen also issued a recall in 2022 of various model year 2016 Volkswagen and Audi vehicles.  The NHTSA says it may take other appropriate action against ARC if they continue to decline initiating a voluntary recall. The agency has indicated that if an ARC recall is not issued, the airbag inflator manufacturer must provide a detailed explanation on why they believe the product is safe, along with data supporting their analysis.  Takata Airbag Recall Still Affecting the U.S. Auto Industry  These latest airbag problems comes while the U.S. auto industry continues to replace defective Takata airbags, which were also found to explode and project metal debris onto vehicle occupants due to a defect in the airbags design. At least 28 deaths and more than 400 injuries have resulted from the defective Takata airbag inflators.  More than 100 million Takata airbags have been recalled worldwide since 2014, impacting tens of millions of vehicles from more than 20 automobile manufacturers. Officials identified that the chemical nitrate was used to inflate the air bags, which can break down from exposure to heat or humidity, resulting in the explosion of metal fragments and debris.  The series of Takata airbag recalls has been considered the largest and one of the most complex series of recalls ever recorded in U.S. history. However, if approximately 67 million ARC Automotive airbags are recalled in the coming weeks, the auto industry could be plagued for years bv the need to repair and replace the recalled airbags, in addition to the risk of potential product liability lawsuits.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFib3V0bGF3c3VpdHMuY29tL2dtLWFyYy1haXJiYWctaW5mbGF0b3ItZXhwbG9zaW9uLXJlY2FsbC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

By Tuesday afternoon firefighters had turned the building at 716 Oregon Ave. back over to the Spokane-based OXARC company, said Ben Shearer, the Pasco Fire Department public information officer.  Firefighters were called shortly before 10:20 a.m. for an explosion in a metal building where acetylene is manufactured. The production building contained only acetylene containers and the machine that makes it.  Acetylene is a flammable gas used in welding and doesn’t produce much smoke when it burns. It’s kept in canisters under pressure, and it can explode when exposed to high heat.  It’s not clear what sparked the fire.  One employee was working in the area when the explosion happened but was able to escape unharmed.  OXARC employees were evaluated by Pasco medics at the scene and one employee was taken to a local medical center to be checked further, said Shearer.  Much of the time battling the blaze was spent planning an approach to extinguish several burning containers of acetylene but not put fire crews at risk.  “The fire was complicated from the aspect that OXARC is a large supplier of many different gas products, some that do not care if they get wet and some react violently if they get wet,” Shearer said in a news release.  They worked with OXARC employees to determine where the acetylene was being stored and making sure the machinery that produced it was shut off.  Firefighters on the scene focused on making sure the heat and fire didn’t spread to other buildings.  “Once we knew what we were dealing with, everything went very quickly and efficiently,” Shearer said.  Shearer didn’t know how extensive the damage was to the building, but the business is shut down at the moment.  OXARC provides welding and industrial supplies and safety products and training from its 21 locations across the Northwest.  While there was some initial concerns about the smoke and acetylene in the air moving through East Pasco, Shearer said the gas had dissipated quickly. He said they are not aware of any public health issues.  Story continues  There also wasn’t any chemical spills. Shearer said firefighters prevented water from going into the storm drains.  An explosion forced people to flee from OXARC Tuesday morning. Firefighters have closed Oregon Avenue to battle the blaze.  Oregon Avenue has opened after being shut between East A Street and East Lewis Street. It also sparked a brief lockdown at some nearby schools as a precaution.  The warm temperatures meant firefighters were being rotated in and out at the scene and then able to rest in a cooling area.  In all, 34 fire units helped at the fire, including crews from Pasco, Richland, Kennewick, Franklin County Fire District 3, Walla Walla Fire District 5, Benton County Fire districts 1 and 4, West Benton Fire Rescue and from the police and utility crews from Pasco and Franklin Emergency Management.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vY2Euc3BvcnRzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL2V4cGxvc2lvbi1maXJlLWZvcmNlLWV2YWN1YXRpb25zLXBhc2NvLTE4MDg1MDYyNC5odG1s0gFeaHR0cHM6Ly9jYS5zcG9ydHMueWFob28uY29tL2FtcGh0bWwvbmV3cy9leHBsb3Npb24tZmlyZS1mb3JjZS1ldmFjdWF0aW9ucy1wYXNjby0xODA4NTA2MjQuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(Image credit: UiT/AKMA3)  Ocean explorers in the Arctic have discovered an underwater volcano spewing mud and methane from inside another, larger crater that probably formed after a catastrophic blowout at the end of the last ice age.  Researchers spotted the unusual feature about 80 miles (130 kilometers) south of Norway's Bear Island, or Bjørnøya, in the Barents Sea. The volcano, which the team named the Borealis Mud Volcano, is only the second of its kind discovered in Norwegian waters.  ""Exploring the seabed and discovering new methane [seeps] is like finding hidden treasures,"" said Stefan Buenz (opens in new tab), a professor at The Arctic University of Norway (University of Tromsø) and co-leader of the Advancing Knowledge of Methane in the Arctic (AKMA) expedition that made the discovery. ""Every time we go down to the seabed, we get the feeling that we have just begun to understand the great and incredible diversity of such [seep] systems,"" Buenz said in a translated statement (opens in new tab).  A submarine mud volcano is a geological structure formed by an expulsion of muddy fluid and gas, predominantly methane.  The Borealis Mud Volcano measures roughly 23 feet (7 meters) in diameter and is about 8 feet (2.5 m) tall. On May 7, the scientists used a remote-controlled rover to capture footage of the small mount continuously emitting a muddy fluid, which the researchers say is rich in methane. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas once it reaches the atmosphere and contributes to climate change .  Related: 'Mind boggling' array of 19,000 undersea volcanoes discovered with high-resolution radar satellites  The volcano sits in the middle of another, much larger crater, which is 984 feet (300 m) wide and 82 feet (25 m) deep. The exceptional formation sits 1,312 feet (400 m) below the sea surface and likely resulted from a sudden and massive methane eruption after the last glacial period, 18,000 years ago, according to the statement.  ""Seeing an underwater eruption in real time reminds me how 'alive' our planet is,"" Giuliana Panieri (opens in new tab), a professor in geology at The Arctic University of Norway and the leader of the expedition, said in the statement.  The researchers found the volcano's flanks teeming with animal life feeding off carbonate crusts — mineral crusts formed when microorganisms consume methane and produce bicarbonate as a byproduct, according to a 2019 study in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health (opens in new tab) — that formed thousands of years ago. They spied sea anemones, sponges, corals, starfish, sea spiders and diverse crustaceans.  The only other known mud volcano in Norwegian waters is the Håkon Mosby volcano. This 0.6-mile-wide (1 km) feature was discovered 4,100 feet (1,250 m) below the water’s surface on the seabed south of Svalbard in 1995, according to the University of Bergen's Center for Geobiology (opens in new tab). Underwater mud volcanoes are difficult to spot and map, but researchers estimate there could be hundreds or thousands of them on the seafloor globally, according to a 2021 chapter in Lecture Notes in Earth System Sciences (opens in new tab).  These volcanoes provide a rare window into geological processes occurring deep below Earth's crust, since they spout mainly water, minerals and fine sediment from these depths. They also offer clues about previous environments and conditions on Earth, and could give an insight into systems on other planets, Panieri said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlc2NpZW5jZS5jb20vcGxhbmV0LWVhcnRoL3ZvbGNhbm9zL3NjaWVudGlzdHMtZGlzY292ZXItZ2lhbnQtY3JhdGVyLWZyb20taWNlLWFnZS1leHBsb3Npb24tdGhhdC1oYXMtbWV0aGFuZS1zcGV3aW5nLW11ZC12b2xjYW5vLWluc2lkZS1pdNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Eyewitness News heard from his daughter, who is looking for help.  “He doesn’t look the same, it makes me sad and I want him to get better soon,” said Marissa Webber Kennan, Stephen’s daughter.  The past five days for Marissa have been draining.  Stephen, the rock of the Webber family, is in extreme pain.  “He can’t use both of his hands at all. He has broken bones on almost all of his fingers. His wrist is shattered the other hand is broken,” Marissa said.  He also has a broken arm, ribs, even burns and cuts on his face.  Thursday morning at Stephen’s repair shop, Sandman Automotive, he and another man were working on a home heating oil tank, using a plasma cutter.  Then there was a noise which was heard up to two miles away.  “You wouldn’t believe the sound that came it was just a huge explosion,” said Brian Daigle, who works nearby.  The two men were rushed to the hospital.  It’s unclear how the second man is doing tonight.  “It was very scary he doesn’t look like my dad because he’s all bandaged up here and his face is very swollen,” said Marissa.  The plan is for Stephen to have surgery next week.  He’ll be out of work for at least a few months. The family needs help, not only with medical bills, but the loss of income at Sandman.  They’ve set up a Go Fund Me page and the community has already sent them more than $13,000.  “He can’t do anything without the help of my mom now or us if we help,” Marissa said. “I’m floored by that amount of money to help.”  Copyright 2023 WFSB.

The explosion, which occurred 8 billion light years away from Earth billions of years ago, has been erupting for three years without any signs of slowing down. Although scientists at first struggled to determine the cause of the cosmic blast, which they have named AT2021lwx, they now think the culprit is a supermassive black hole that came in contact with a gargantuan cloud of gas. That’s according to findings recently published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.  Stretching across a space that is 100 times the size of our solar system, the black hole formation is currently giving off 100 times more energy than the sun will emit over the course of its entire 10-billion-year lifetime.  The explosion itself is far from Earth, but its discovery could help scientists better understand black holes, which sit at the center of many galaxies, including our own.  “It really seems like, especially when they have time to do some more modeling, this will be an important step in understanding what’s happening in the middle of galaxies,” says Jonathan Blazek, a physics professor at Northeastern University.  Astronomers at the Zwicky Transient Facility in California originally discovered AT2021lwx in 2020 but struggled to suss out the exact cause of such a massive explosion. AT2021lwx was emitting too much light for too long to fit any known category of astronomical phenomenon, whether it was a supernova, aka an exploding star, or a tidal disruption, which occurs when a star has been pulled into a black hole and destroyed.  Eventually, NASA’s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, Chile’s New Technology Telescope and Spain’s Gran Telescopio Canarias were all brought online to aid in studying AT2021lwx. With all these telescopes pointed at AT2021lwx, astronomers eventually identified the black hole-related explanation they have settled on in their findings.  Blazek says the astrophysical qualities of a black hole definitely are primed to cause an explosion at this scale. Once a black hole gets large enough, it creates such a gravitational whirlpool that it starts sucking in anything that’s close to it, growing in the process. Anything that crosses the event horizon, the point of no return, and falls into the black hole is gone––it will never be seen or heard from again. That includes light.  So, how does a black hole cause an explosion with enough light to be seen billions of light years away by scientists on Earth?  “Because these are such big, extreme objects, you can have some pretty big, extreme things happening just outside the event horizon,” Blazek says.  The pull of a black hole is so strong that anything caught in its wake gets accelerated to the point where it’s moving near the speed of light, creating swirling, rapidly moving particles that are bumping into each other.  “You get really, really, really hot material outside the event horizon of the blackhole, and this really hot material can emit a lot of energy,” Blazek says. “It turns out the most efficient way to get energy out of mass is to drop it into a black hole.”  According to Blazek, there is a whole class of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) that are powered this way. Mass falls into a black hole, it gets shredded at high velocities and emits a ton of energy. But typically those kinds of events create a steadily increasing amount of energy and light that scientists can observe. That wasn’t the case here.  “They can find no evidence that this was active before, so their best theory is that this was a blackhole about a billion solar masses [large] that was just sitting there quietly because nothing was around to fall in,” he says. “Then, they think a big mass of gas got too close and pretty quickly got shredded and fell in.”  Blazek says this explosion has similarities to other cosmic phenomena, like AGNs, but it’s the differences that make the discovery so exciting.  Blazek says understanding more about the nature of black holes could help with his own work, which involves using galaxies and the movement of mass through the universe to map the cosmos. Black holes are instrumental in moving all kinds of matter through outer space. Although astronomers have learned a lot about black holes, there is still much that isn’t known about how supermassive black holes are created. By further studying an event like this cosmic explosion, scientists could unlock even more about these powerful cosmic forces and the nature of our galaxy as well.  “We don’t fully understand how these things grow, especially early on in their lives,” Blazek says. “If we see an event where a cloud of more than 1,000 solar masses is falling onto a black hole, in the sort of event we didn’t know could happen, that could be an important piece of this puzzle.”  Cody Mello-Klein is a Northeastern Global News reporter.

"explosion","2021-09-24","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 20:00:06","Astronomers have witnessed the largest explosion in space.  The explosive event labeled AT2021lwx was observed to be ten times brighter than any known supernova, the explosions that occur as massive stars die. And whereas supernova explosions only last a few months, this explosive event has been raging for at least three years.  AT2021lwx is also three times brighter than the light that is emitted as stars are ripped apart and devoured by supermassive black holes, occurrences called ""tidal disruption events"" or ""TDEs."" The blast is around 8 billion light-years from Earth and thus occurred when the universe was just 6 billion years old.  AT2021lwx was first spotted by the Zwicky Transient Facility in California in 2020 and was then picked up by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) based in Hawaii. Both of these systems are designed to survey the night sky for astronomical events that rapidly change in brightness over time, also known as ""transients."" This change in brightness can indicate a supernova or a gamma-ray burst (GRB) deep in the universe or something much closer to home like a comet or an asteroid.  Though it was spotted by these facilities three years ago, the sheer scale and power of the explosion AT2021lwx were unknown until now.  ""We came upon this by chance, as it was flagged by our search algorithm when we were searching for a type of supernova,"" University of Southampton research fellow Philip Wiseman, who led the research, said in an emailed statement. ""Most supernovae and TDEs only last for a couple of months before fading away. For something to be bright for two plus years was immediately very unusual.""  Wiseman and the team of astronomers think that AT2021lwx may be the result of a black hole violently disrupting a cloud of gas with a mass thousands of times greater than the sun. As it did so, the black hole swallowed fragments of the gas cloud, sending shockwaves into both what remains of the gas and into a wider donut-shaped torus of dust surrounding it, causing them to emit bright electromagnetic radiation.  Events like this have been witnessed before, they are rare. What's more, none that have been witnessed previously have been on the scale of AT2021lwx.  While AT2021lwx isn't actually as bright as the gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A spotted by astronomers in 2022, this event that erupted from 2.4 billion light-years away lasted for just ten hours after detection. Even though that is quite long for a GRB, it means that AT2021lwx has put out far more energy over its entire lifetime than this gamma-ray burst did in its own.  Measuring the power of a cosmic explosion  Following its initial discovery, the team of researchers behind this discovery continued to examine AT2021lwx using several different telescopes including the Neil Gehrels Swift Telescope, the New Technology Telescope in Chile, and the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, Spain.  Following these observations, the researchers took the spectrum of light that was emitted from the event and split it down into its constituent wavelengths, measuring how light was emitted and absorbed around the event. This allowed the researchers to calculate the distance to the source of AT2021lwx.  ""Once you know the distance to the object and how bright it appears to us, you can calculate the brightness of the object at its source,"" team member and University of Southampton professor Sebastian Hönig said in the statement. ""Once we'd performed those calculations, we realized this is extremely bright.""  The only thing in the known universe that is as bright as AT2021lwx are supermassive black holes. When these black holes feed on stellar gases that fall into them at high velocities, they can let off incredibly bright emissions known as quasars.  ""With a quasar, we see the brightness flickering up and down over time,"" team member and University of Southampton professor Mark Sullivan added. ""But looking back over a decade there was no detection of AT2021lwx, then suddenly it appears with the brightness of the brightest things in the universe, which is unprecedented.""  Though there are other possible explanations for the explosive event, the astronomers currently favor the explanation that sees an extremely large cloud of mostly gaseous hydrogen or dust that was knocked from its orbit around the black hole and sucked into it. This will only be conclusively determined when the team has collected more data about AT2021lwx.  The team will now look at the explosion in different wavelengths of light including X-rays. Doing so could reveal the temperature of the event and what processes are driving it. They will also conduct computer simulations to discover if their model of a titanic gas cloud disrupted by a black hole could account for AT2021lwx.  ""With new facilities, like the Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time, coming online in the next few years, we are hoping to discover more events like this and learn more about them,"" Wiseman concluded in the statement. ""It could be that these events, although extremely rare, are so energetic that they are key processes to how the centers of galaxies change over time.""

At first the tremors, which were registered on Saturday, were thought to have been caused by earthquakes.  Then, seismologists theorised that they originated from controlled explosions in Poland, almost 90 miles to the south, as part of military exercises.  But they are still not certain of the true origin of the unexplained geological phenomenon.  FILE PHOTO: Gas leak at Nord Stream 2 as seen from the Danish F-16 interceptor on Bornholm, Denmark September 27, 2022  On Monday, the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, an official body that monitors the underground, said the tremors were 'not caused by earthquakes, but by pressure waves from an event in the atmosphere.'  However, they came from 'an unknown source.'  'The seismologists can report that it is unlikely that the tremors originate from a controlled explosion in Poland, which was carried out shortly before the first reports of tremors on Bornholm,' the body known as GEUS said in a statement.  On Saturday, GEUS said it had received 'more than 60' tips from people on Bornholm that 'earthquake-like tremors' - described as a deep rumbling, shaking and rattling, changing pressure in the ear - had been reported in the afternoon on Bornholm.  This map, created shortly after the leaks in the Nord Stream pipeline were detected, shows the location of the Danish island of Bornholm  Police said they too were contacted by members of the public about the tremor on the eastern part of the island.  Danish media reported that the tremors caused a crack in the wall of a house, but no one was hurt.  GEUS said that seismic tremors were measured at a magnitude of 2.3.  Polish authorities have said that there was intensive activity during the Anakonda23 exercise in Ustka, northern Poland, involving jet fighters and live firing of artillery munitions.  GEUS, an independent research and advisory institution within Denmark's Ministry of Climate, Energy and Utilities, said that it had two seismographs on Bornholm that collect data around the clock.  Bornholm, home to nearly 40,000 people, is a rocky island in the Baltic Sea, south of Sweden, northeast of Germany and north of Poland.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlLTEyMDg1NjcxL015c3RlcmlvdXMtdHJlbW9ycy1yb2NrLURhbmlzaC1pc2xhbmQtQm9ybmhvbG0tbmVhci1Ob3JkLVN0cmVhbS1leHBsb3Npb24tc2l0ZS5odG1s0gGJAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUtMTIwODU2NzEvYW1wL015c3RlcmlvdXMtdHJlbW9ycy1yb2NrLURhbmlzaC1pc2xhbmQtQm9ybmhvbG0tbmVhci1Ob3JkLVN0cmVhbS1leHBsb3Npb24tc2l0ZS5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"explosion","2023-05-12","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Mon 15 May 2023 15:15:00","Something pretty huge happened in space recently. Well, that’s not strictly true – to be more accurate, something truly gargantuan happened in space approximately 8 billion years ago, that we are only just finding out about now. Last Friday, scientists revealed the largest cosmic explosion ever witnessed: like a supernova, but more than 10 times brighter and more powerful than any other seen before. And its cause? A giant cloud of gas being sucked into a supermassive black hole.  If you want people to be excited about something, it’s important to come up with a catchy name. So, taking a leaf out of Elon Musk’s book of baby names, scientists called it AT2021lwx. But I’m gonna call her Sue. Sue Pernova. (You’re welcome.)  Sue had humble beginnings. She started out like the damp patch in the corner of your bathroom – small and barely noticeable, then over the course of time growing into something monstrous and without precedent. It was only when scientists established just how distant Sue was (8 billion lightyears) that they realised quite how much energy she must be burning to produce a light so bright.  01:17 ‘Absolutely gargantuan’: astrophysicist explains largest cosmic explosion ever witnessed – video  This is all well and good, I hear you cry, but why should I care? Sue seems great, but she lives miles away and besides I’m far too busy having to do the weekly shop, picking up the kids from school and Googling “black mould removal”. Well, I’ve been a space superfan since I was old enough to say “Houston we have a problem”, so you don’t have to convince me to care. But space can give us an insight into our existence.  There are certain aspects of space exploration that are easy to defend. Like the Dart mission last year which successfully tested technology designed to shift an asteroid off its course, protecting Earth and its inhabitants from a fatal collision. Most of us have a vested interest in the Earth not being smashed to smithereens, so it’s great to know that Nasa is on the case.  Some of the other stuff, though, is far more abstract and, for want of a better word, nerdy. But the truth is, every time something like this happens it puts another piece in the puzzle of understanding where we came from and where we will go.  We all know some basic things about the universe and our solar system from our school days: Jupiter has its raging stormy eye, Saturn has its rings, and Pluto has an identity crisis about its latest reclassification. But what you perhaps didn’t know, because they only found out recently, is that Saturn didn’t always have its rings.  A study from the University of Colorado suggests that the rings are only 400 million years old, with Saturn being nearer 4.5 billion years in age. Those figures are quite hard to get your head around, but if you scale that timeline down, it’s the equivalent of an 85-year-old bloke called Stanley deciding to grow a mo-hawk at 81. That’s a pretty wild and late-stage development, right? Certainly not something to define his whole existence by.  In the even blinkier-blink of an eye that is the period of human existence, we happen to have magically coincided with this beautiful phenomenon. Us being here now at the same time of Saturn’s rings is a delightful coincidence: a reminder that everything is fleeting, everything is changing, even in the universe.  Someone sent me a meme recently with a picture of the galaxy and an arrow pointing to a barely visible dot labelled “You, crying in the shower”. Apart from being very funny, it’s also very true (the crying bit, certainly). I find the underlying message of it weirdly profound. We are all so very small and the universe is so very big and almost all of our hopes, dreams and fears are entirely trivial.  If that doesn’t sound particularly comforting, stick with me. In 2009, Nasa released captures from the Hubble telescope showing the deepest image of the universe ever taken to date, allowing you to scroll in and out of hundreds of galaxies and solar systems that seemingly go on for ever. If you ever need a moment of profound perspective, that does it.  Cosmically speaking, if we are all insignificant, then everything we do is almost in defiance of that. It renders the choices we make simultaneously meaningless and also the most wonderful act of living; one more beautiful addition to an already improbable existence. That’s a pretty liberating thought. It’s all connected. Like it or not, we’re all part of a kind of celestial foxtrot: expanding, contracting, dying and being reborn.  So next time you hear about something happening a million miles away, think about how you’re a small part of that and how incredible it is to exist. Why not look out of your window tonight – maybe you’ll see the light from some supernova long since gone. And who knows, perhaps someone 8 billion lightyears away will be looking back from their damp, damp, bathroom, seeing the dead light from our sun and wondering about their own place in the universe.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9jb21tZW50aXNmcmVlLzIwMjMvbWF5LzE1L2JpZ2dlc3QtZXZlci1zcGFjZS1leHBsb3Npb24tOC1iaWxsaW9uLWxpZ2h0eWVhcnPSAWdodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vY29tbWVudGlzZnJlZS8yMDIzL21heS8xNS9iaWdnZXN0LWV2ZXItc3BhY2UtZXhwbG9zaW9uLTgtYmlsbGlvbi1saWdodHllYXJz?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

'Sport's Greatest Statistical Anomalies' is his book, and aside from being a BRILLIANT read, is testament to his love of all things sport, and in particular stats. A Nets fan, James yearns for the days of yesteryear, when playoffs were all but irrelevant and the likes of Caris Levert and Jarrett Allen were running the show.  Philadelphia 76ers coach Doc Rivers has been on the wrong end of plenty of dominant Game 7 performances, but Jayson Tatum’s explosion on Sunday night ranks right at the top, according to the man himself.  Tatum was simply unstoppable in the series-deciding matchup, putting up a mammoth 51 points on 17-28 shooting while also grabbing 13 boards and dishing out five assists en route to a 112-88 victory. James Harden faltered – again – and so too did Joel Embiid, but Tatum was the clear difference-maker throughout the course of the game.  In the wake of the defeat, Tatum’s performance was ranked by Rivers as one of the absolute best, saying that the only game which compares was LeBron James’ Game 6 effort against his Boston Celtics in 2012.

But James had other ideas. He hit an incredible 19 of his 26 shots, ending the game with 45 points, 15 rebounds and five assists to lead the Heat to victory.  11 years on, clearly Doc Rivers hasn’t forgotten that night, and it doesn’t appear likely that he’ll forget this one in a hurry either. His Game 7 record of 6-10 will be the subject of plenty of discussion over the coming days, and rightly or wrongly, will no doubt have plenty of aggrieved Sixers fans politely suggesting their team finds a new coach.  Incidentally, after LeBron James’ historic performance in 2012, the Heat went on to win Game 7 and with it the series, before beating the Oklahoma City Thunder in five games to win the championship. The Celtics will be hoping that Jayson Tatum’s performance leads to the same result.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vY2x1dGNocG9pbnRzLmNvbS9jZWx0aWNzLW5ld3MtamF5c29uLXRhdHVtcy01MS1wb2ludC1leHBsb3Npb24tZHJhd3MtbGVicm9uLWphbWVzLWNvbXBhcmlzb24tZnJvbS1kb2Mtcml2ZXJz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

But a flurry of hard hit balls and two big innings from its senior leaders allowed it to crawl back and earn the decisive victory.  The Wolverines (26-22 overall, 13-8 Big Ten) prevailed on senior day behind the power of their bats to sweep Northwestern (8-38, 3-18) by a score of 15-5.  Coming off of a Big Ten Pitcher of the Week performance against Minnesota, senior left-hander Jacob Denner looked to stay hot on the mound. But, stymied early by the Wildcats’ offense, Michigan entered an early hole, giving up two runs quickly in the first inning.  With Denner unable to replicate his dominance from a week ago in the early innings, the Wolverines needed their bats to keep them in the game — and they delivered. In the bottom of the third inning the bats unleashed, as back-to-back doubles from graduate shortstop Cody Jefferis and senior second baseman Ted Burton drove in two RBI to bring Michigan within one run.  “I like a hot Teddy,” Michigan coach Tracy Smith said. “When he’s hot, he’s fun to watch. That’s what your older guys are supposed to do, is lead by example and through their play. He’s doing an excellent job of that.”  But the best was still to come for the Wolverines.  The next inning, senior third baseman Brandon Lawrence ignited a two-out onslaught with an RBI single, followed by home runs from Jefferis and Burton — Jefferis’ first homer of the season and Burton’s third in just this series. Michigan entered the bottom of the fourth down by one, but exited up by four.  After the early blows, the Wolverines used the crucial bottom of the fourth inning to retake all momentum, only needing to close out the rest of the game — and series.  Continuing that momentum, Denner’s pitching began to smooth, allowing just two more runs in the top of the seventh before handing off to senior right-hander John Torroella with a three run Michigan lead.  “Even with the hits, (Denner) didn’t give up much solid contact,” Smith said. “Following up his unbelievable performance from last week is what we’re gonna need him to do.”  While not equal to his career best performance last weekend, Denner still kept the Wolverines in position to hold their lead.  While the lead was safe at the time of Denner’s exit, it needed insurance. And that is where Jefferis re-enters the equation.  With the bases loaded in the bottom of the eighth inning, the senior roped a triple down the right field line. The hit scored all three runners, bolstering a six-run inning to close out a cycle performance at the plate for Jefferis.  “That really spread it open there,” Smith said. “Not only did it give him the cycle, but we were just saying, ‘Gosh, we need one more run just to kind of get away,’ … so the triple was big.”  He delivered the knockout shot. By piling on six runs in the seventh inning, Michigan had replicated and gone beyond what it did in its dominant fourth inning. The game was no longer in reach for Northwestern and the Wolverines achieved their lead on the backs of their seniors.  Earning the series sweep against the Wildcats is essential to Michigan’s hopes of another Big Ten Tournament run. And the final victory on Sunday shows that the Wolverines’ bats are heating up at just the right time.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pY2hpZ2FuZGFpbHkuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9iYXNlYmFsbC9iaWctaW5uaW5ncy1hbmQtdmV0ZXJhbi1wZXJmb3JtYW5jZXMtZWFybi1taWNoaWdhbi1zd2VlcC1hZ2FpbnN0LW5vcnRod2VzdGVybi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"explosion","2023-05-05","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Sun 14 May 2023 22:02:32","Scientists say they have observed a dying star swallowing a planet for the first time.  Astronomers recently reported the observation of what appeared to be a large gas planet being eaten up by its aging star. The team said the sun-like star had been expanding for a very long time and finally got so big that it swallowed the nearby planet.  The researchers who made the observations said the star is in our Milky Way galaxy, about 12,000 light years from Earth. A light year is the distance light travels in a year – about 9.5 trillion kilometers. The findings were recently reported in a study published in Nature.  Most planets are believed to meet the end of their life when the star they are orbiting runs out of energy. This process causes the star to turn into a “red giant” that grows very large. The star can then swallow up the planet, and anything else that nears it.  The scientists say the planet’s destruction happened between 10,000 and 15,000 years ago near the Aquila constellation. At that time, the star was around 10 billion years old. The team said the swallowing event created a hot explosion of light, followed by a large release of dust that shot out into space.  Kishalay De is a researcher from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He discovered the light explosion by accident in 2020. He was examining data captured by the Palomar Observatory, based near San Diego, California.  De said he was surprised to observe a star that had suddenly increased in brightness by more than 100 times over a period of 10 days. He had been searching for binary star systems. These are sets of two stars that orbit around a common center of mass. When the larger of the stars takes bites out of the other, a bright explosion called an “outburst” happens.  But De said his examinations suggested the outburst was surrounded by cold gas, meaning it could not be a binary system. He learned from another space telescope that the star had also started releasing large amounts of dust months before the outburst.  While scientists had observed past star expansions, this was the first time they have been able to observe a complete planet-swallowing event.  The researchers said the collected data showed the swallowed planet was a “gas giant” with a similar mass to the planet Jupiter. They noted that the planet had become so close to its star that it could complete a full orbit in just one day.  The planet is believed to have “engulfed” the planet over a period of around 100 days, the team said. The bright explosion happened in the final 10 days as the planet was totally destroyed.  Miguel Montarges is an astronomer at the Paris Observatory who was not involved in the research. He told the French news agency AFP the star was thousands of degrees hotter than the planet when the destruction happened. He explained, ""It's like putting an ice cube into a boiling pot.""  Astronomers say the same event is expected to happen to other planets – including Mercury, Venus and Earth. De said our sun will likely reach its red giant period in about 5 billion years.  Astronomers do not know if more planets are circling the star at a safer distance. If so, De said they may have thousands of years before also getting swallowed up.  Now that they know what to look for, the researchers will be looking for more similar events. They believe thousands of planets around other stars will likely suffer the same fate as this one did.  Morgan MacLeod is a postdoctoral researcher at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Massachusetts. He told Reuters news agency he finds it “humbling” to think about our own planet facing the same destruction. MacLeod noted that since Earth is much smaller, its destruction will not cause such an outburst.  “When Earth is eventually swallowed, the sun will hardly notice,"" he said.  I’m Bryan Lynn.

"explosion","2023-05-10","Not Discerned","{""Lagos"", ""Lagos"", ""Nigeria""}","Sun 14 May 2023 23:28:40","Cooking Gas  By Elizabeth Adegbesan  Nigerians have been given to improvisations since the turn of inflation and the economic crisis.  Most of the improvisations have saved them money and helped to keep heads above water.  However, the new way of boycotting the high cost of cooking gas cylinders may cost lives than it can save money.  Economy&Lifestyle discovered that the cost of gas cylinders has risen so high that it becomes difficult for average homes to afford and still fill them with gas.  The situation becomes worse when considering that the pump price of kerosene, which would have been an alternative, is prohibitive.  Checks show that the price of cylinders varies according to the sizes. A 3kg gas cylinder costs N14,000, 5kg-N16,000 6kg – N17,000 and 12.5kg costs N19,000. Filling the cylinders with cooking gas also costs N2,600 for 3kg, N5,200 for 6kg, N8,950 for 10.5kg and N10,650 for 12.5 kg.  This means that an average home with a worn-out 5kg will need N20,250 to buy a new one and fill it, which is hard to come by.  So, the resolve is to refurbish the old ones and still manage them. However, that is where the danger is.  Mrs. Rukayat Adesoji, a trader, said her gas cylinder got rusted and no longer stands erect since last month, but due to high cost of purchasing the cylinders, she took it to a welder who patched the legs, repainted it, and since then, she has been using it.  “My gas cylinder which was 6kg got rusted and no longer stands erect since last month. When I asked for the price, I was told it was N17, 500. I was discussing it with a friend who advised me to take it to a welder to paint it and construct a new stand. I heeded to her advice and at the end spent just N3, 000 to turn my cooking gas to a brand new.”  Apart from refurbishing cylinders, some people don’t even know when their cylinders will expire. Mrs. Mercy Opara, a hair stylist, fell in that category as she explained: “I am taking my gas cylinder to the welder to spray it for me. It just cost N1, 500. The cost of buying a new cylinder is high. I have been using my cylinder for over 7 years and I don’t even know the expiry date. I just pray God blesses me so that I can buy a new one. But this one I am managing will look neat after spraying it for another two years.”  Mr. Adekanbi Joseph, a wielder, said he paints cylinder and “To paint and rebuild a cylinder stand, I charge N4, 500. Many people come here to paint as a new cylinder is now very expensive to get.”  Explaining the danger in using refurbished cylinders, The Chief Executive Officer, FKT Cooking gas and general goods, Mr. Benjamin Hope said: “A brand new cylinder can explode if the locks are not well keyed after using and if the cylinder filled with gas was moved from one place.  “There are many reasons for the high cost of gas cylinders in Nigeria. One is the cost of importation due to the exchange rate. Another is the increased migration from the use of kerosene to cooking gas which has necessitated increased demand for gas cylinders.  “You know that in such a case there will be increased importation of cylinders.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhbmd1YXJkbmdyLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1L3JlZnVyYmlzaGVkLWdhcy1jeWxpbmRlcnMtbmV4dC1ib21icy13YWl0aW5nLXRvLWV4cGxvZGUv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudmFuZ3VhcmRuZ3IuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvcmVmdXJiaXNoZWQtZ2FzLWN5bGluZGVycy1uZXh0LWJvbWJzLXdhaXRpbmctdG8tZXhwbG9kZS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

He also co-hosts Cash Considerations: A Chicago Bulls Podcast for the Blue Wire Network.  Boston Celtics head coach Joe Mazzulla changed his starting lineup for Game 6 against the Philadelphia 76ers, inserting big man Robert Williams III and moving Derrick White to the bench. While the Celtics were on the ropes in the fourth quarter and needed both a late Jayson Tatum explosion and Sixers collapse to win, the move undoubtedly worked given Boston’s fast start to the game and Williams’ plus-18 in the box score. Because of this, it’s no surprise Mazzulla is sticking with this lineup for Sunday’s Game 7.  Mazzulla spoke to the media before the do-or-die game and confirmed he will keep the two-big starting lineup in place against Joel Embiid and Co., per ESPN’s Tim Bontemps. That means it will be Williams, Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart and Al Horford going up against Philly.  Williams played 28 minutes in Game 6, his highest playing time of the series. The big man was under 20 minutes in the prior three games and had played a high of 22 points in Game 2 before Game 6. He made his presence known with 10 points, nine rebounds and two blocks in those 28 minutes. And, again, the Celtics outscored the Sixers by 18 points when Williams was on the court.

If they can get up early and get the crowd into it, the Sixers will be in big trouble. It’s going to be a fascinating Game 7 with an Eastern Conference Finals date against the Miami Heat on the line.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vY2x1dGNocG9pbnRzLmNvbS9jZWx0aWNzLW5ld3MtYm9zdG9uLW1ha2VzLWNydWNpYWwtc3RhcnRpbmctbGluZXVwLWRlY2lzaW9uLWdhbWUtNy1zaXhlcnPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The photographer, Boris Eldagsen, openly admitted that the image was AI generated and refused to accept the award, saying he had entered it to start a debate over whether an AI-generated image could in fact be a photograph.  The stunt was a response to an explosion in readily accessible AI tools. Last November’s launch of ChatGPT was, on the face of it, one of the most momentous technological advances in recent years. A text-based system, ChatGPT can write stories, college essays, job applications and so on in clear, fluent language and, if the user so chooses, in the style of Shakespeare, Donald Trump or Chaucer.  It clocked up over 100 million users in the first two months after launch, making it the fastest growing consumer application in history. And, less than four months after ChatGPT hit the headlines, OpenAI, the developer, launched GPT-4, the successor to GPT-3, the artificial intelligence system on which ChatGPT is based.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idWlsZGluZy5jby51ay9idWlsZGluZy10aGUtZnV0dXJlLWNvbW1pc3Npb24vd2hhdC1kb2VzLWFydGlmaWNpYWwtaW50ZWxsaWdlbmNlLW1lYW4tZm9yLWNvbnN0cnVjdGlvbi81MTIzMTEyLmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
