"explosion","2023-05-18","Not Discerned","{""Calcutta"", ""WestBengal"", ""India""}","Fri 19 May 2023 04:59:06","Kolkata: In a major shocker for the sleuths investigating the explosion at an illegal firecracker factory at Egra in West Bengal’s East Midnapore district that claimed nine lives, the prime accused and the owner of the said factory, Krishnapada Bag a.k.a. Bhanu died at a hospital in Cuttack Friday.  He was arrested by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of the West Bengal Police Thursday only along with his son, Prithvijit Bag and nephew Biswajit Bag. However, Bhanu, who himself suffered severe burn injuries in that explosion, could not be released from the hospital and brought back to West Bengal.  Confirming the death of Bhanu, the district police superintendent of East Midnapore K. Amarnath claimed that attempts are being made to bring Bhanu’s body back to West Bengal.  Following the death of Bhanu, his son and nephew are the two prime accused now. His nephew, Biswajit has been taken into custody of CID. After the cremation, the police will also take his son, Prithvijit in custody.  State police sources said that Bhanu got admitted to the hospital at Cuttack by misleading the authorities there. He told them that his injury was due to a cylinder blast at a function.  On Thursday, a division bench of the Calcutta High Court directed CID to continue with the probe on the explosion, but after including sections of the Explosives Act in the FIR.  In the initial FIR filed by the police, only sections under the Indian Penal Code and West Bengal Fire Service Act were included for which the state police attracted severe criticism.  Although the initial police investigation has suggested that the explosion was probably from the firecracker manufacturing raw material stocked at the illegal factory, the opposition parties have claimed that the impact of the explosion proves that not firecrackers but crude bombs were being manufactured there.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9yaXNzYXBvc3QuY29tL2JlbmdhbC1maXJlY3JhY2tlci1ibGFzdC1jYXNlLXByaW1lLWFjY3VzZWQtZmFjdG9yeS1vd25lci1kaWVzLWluLW9kaXNoYS1ob3NwaXRhbC_SAW1odHRwczovL3d3dy5vcmlzc2Fwb3N0LmNvbS9iZW5nYWwtZmlyZWNyYWNrZXItYmxhc3QtY2FzZS1wcmltZS1hY2N1c2VkLWZhY3Rvcnktb3duZXItZGllcy1pbi1vZGlzaGEtaG9zcGl0YWwv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"explosion","1989-12-03","Not Discerned","{""Berlin"", ""Berlin"", ""Germany""}","Thu 18 May 2023 00:46:00","Training as a photographer in the early 1980s, Marquardt initially turned his lens on the citizens of East Berlin, with a selection of the resulting portraits featuring in a new exhibition at ArtsDistrict Brooklyn, titled DISTURBING BEAUTY. He recalls shooting the earliest of these black-and-white photos in a cemetery in the borough of Mitte in 1983, explaining: “Cemeteries were quite untouched by ‘dictatorship’ and already seemed [to have] a disturbing beauty to me.”  For more than 18 years, the photographer and bouncer Sven Marquardt has manned the doors of the Berlin superclub Berghain – the perfect vantage point to watch the evolution of the city’s legendary underground scene. “For me and my generation, it still serves as an interface to youth culture,” he tells Dazed, but his connection to the city goes much further back, to the years preceding the fall of the Berlin Wall.  Following the fall of the Berlin Wall, however, Marquardt laid his camera down for several years, caught up in the wild explosion of unified Berlin’s club scene. For several years, he worked as a doorman at the pivotal venue Ostgut, before its closure in 2003. With the opening of Berghain in 2004, he became the nightlife icon (and dreaded gatekeeper for Berghain hopefuls) that we recognise today.  “At the outset nobody knew how it would turn out, and how long it would exist,” he says of the club. 18 years later, though – and despite numerous challenges – Berghain is still going strong, not just as a venue, but as a space with a “strong connection” to Marquardt’s creative work, alongside that of countless other artists.  “For me, club culture has always stood for inspiration, for riot, new departures, free spaces, individuals... zeitgeist,” the photographer adds. As for his notoriously difficult door policy: “It is about protecting the safe space that is Berghain, which also means protecting club culture.” Marquardt notes that the strict entry requirements don’t apply to the subjects in front of his camera, but it’s hard to deny the presence of a sharp curatorial gaze in DISTURBING BEAUTY – a rarefied air that spans subjects young and old from across Berlin’s underground, and beyond.  “Over three decades I have been fortunate enough to see thousands of interesting people,” he concludes. “At the club doors of Berlin, as well as in front of my camera. Looking at people is something marvellous, and an essential part of my life.”  DISTURBING BEAUTY runs at ArtsDistrict Brooklyn from May 18 to May 21, presented by Galerie Deschler. The exhibit is hosted in collaboration with Teksupport, the underground events collective founded by Rob Toma.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYXplZGRpZ2l0YWwuY29tL2FydC1waG90b2dyYXBoeS9hcnRpY2xlLzU5ODg1LzEvYmVybGluLW5pZ2h0bGlmZS1pY29uLXN2ZW4tbWFycXVhcmR0LXN1YnZlcnNpdmUtaGlzdG9yeS1iZXJnaGFpbi1jbHViLWN1bHR1cmXSAZABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGF6ZWRkaWdpdGFsLmNvbS9hcnQtcGhvdG9ncmFwaHkvYXJ0aWNsZS81OTg4NS8xL2Jlcmxpbi1uaWdodGxpZmUtaWNvbi1zdmVuLW1hcnF1YXJkdC1zdWJ2ZXJzaXZlLWhpc3RvcnktYmVyZ2hhaW4tY2x1Yi1jdWx0dXJlP2FtcD0x?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"explosion","1945-04-15","Not Discerned","{""Hiroshima"", ""Hiroshima"", ""Japan""}","Fri 19 May 2023 02:55:00","Our species arose in Africa more than 300,000 years ago, with the oldest-known Homo sapiens fossils discovered at a site in Morocco called Jebel Irhoud, located between Marrakech and the Atlantic coast.  But the scarcity of Homo sapiens fossils from early in our evolutionary history and the geographical spread of those remains in Africa in places like Ethiopia and South Africa have made it difficult to piece together how our species emerged and dispersed across the continent before trekking worldwide. A new study tapping into genome data from modern-day African populations is offering insight into how this may have unfolded.  The research indicated that multiple ancestral groups from across Africa contributed to the emergence of Homo sapiens in a patchwork manner, migrating from one region to another and mixing with one another over hundreds of thousands of years. It also found that everyone alive today can trace their ancestry to at least two distinct populations that were present in Africa dating back about a million years.  The findings did not support a longstanding hypothesis that a single region in Africa gave rise to Homo sapiens or a scenario involving mixture with an unidentified closely related species in the human evolutionary lineage within Africa.  ""All humans share relatively recent common ancestry, but the story in the deeper past is more complicated than our species evolving in just a single location or in isolation,"" said University of Wisconsin-Madison population geneticist Aaron Ragsdale, lead author of the study published this week in the journal Nature.  The ancestral groups were likely spread across a geographic landscape in a population structure that, Ragsdale said, ""was 'weak,' meaning that there was ongoing or at least recurrent migration between groups, and this maintained genetic similarity across ancestral populations.""  Because of the paucity of fossil remains and archaeological evidence, the researchers turned to genome data from living people to find clues about the past. They examined genome data from 290 people, mostly from four geographically and genetically diverse African peoples, to trace the similarities and differences between the populations and identify genetic interconnections over hundreds of thousands of years.  These included: 85 individuals from a West African group called the Mende from Sierra Leone; 44 individuals from the Nama Khoe-San group from southern Africa; 46 individuals from the Amhara and Oromo groups in Ethiopia; and 23 individuals from the Gumuz group, also from Ethiopia. Genome data also was examined from 91 Europeans to account for post-colonial era influence and from a Neanderthal, the extinct human species that was concentrated in Europe until about 40,000 years ago.  The fossil record is scanty in the time period that would be most informative about the emergence and spread of Homo sapiens, and there is no ancient DNA from skeletal or dental remains from these time periods, the researchers said.  ""While we find evidence of anatomically modern human remains and artifacts in different parts of Africa, they are so sparse in space and time that it is difficult to understand their relationships with each other, and with us,"" said study geneticist and study co-author Simon Gravel of McGill University in Montreal. ""Were they related to each other? Are they related to our ancestors, or were they local populations who went extinct?""  ""Genetic data was inherited from a continuous chain of transmissions dating back to well before the origins of modern humans. The relatedness among contemporary humans contains a lot of information about this chain of events,"" Gravel added. ""By building models of how these transmissions occurred, we can test detailed models that relate past populations to present-day populations.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRic25ld3MubmV0L3NjaWVuY2UvZ2Vub21lLWRhdGEtc2hlZHMtbGlnaHQtaG93LWhvbW8tc2FwaWVucy1hcm9zZS1hZnJpY2EtNjM0MzQy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"explosion","2023-04-17","Not Discerned","{""Gaza"", ""Gaza"", ""GazaStrip""}","Thu 18 May 2023 15:01:27","Mohammed Sarsour looks out from one of the windows of his damaged apartment in Deir al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip, days after it was hit by an Israeli air strike  Lying in a Gaza hospital, Najwa Abu Aisha says she stood on the roof of her home when shrapnel sliced through her spinal cord in the latest cross-border violence.  ""I was on the roof checking the water barrels, (when) suddenly I heard the sound of an explosion which caused the water barrel to fall on me. I fell on the neighbour's house and, after that, I didn't feel anything,"" she said.  The 48-year-old is one of 190 people health authorities in the coastal enclave said were wounded in five days of fighting last week between Palestinian militants and Israel, which killed 35 people.  Abu Aisha has no memory of what caused the explosion -- whether it was outgoing or incoming fire -- and her son who was with her remains unable to talk about what happened to his mother.  The family told AFP their home in northern Gaza City is beside a site used by Islamic Jihad militants.  The group fired volleys of rockets from Gaza towards Israel, after top figures within the group were killed in Israeli strikes.  ""I'm half paralysed, I have pain that's not normal and I can't bear any movement of my body,"" said Abu Aisha.  ""I'm tired,"" she said, surrounded by family in a private room within Shifa hospital.  In targeting Islamic Jihad, the Israeli military said it carried out assessments which ""showed that the expected collateral damage to civilians and civilian property will not be excessive in relation to the military advantage anticipated in the attack"".  - 'Destroyed our dreams' -  Doctor Moatasem al-Nono, who was supervising Abu Aisha's case, said the wound to her spinal cord was so severe there is no hope of her regaining movement in her lower limbs.  Her condition has also cut off a vital income for the family in the blockaded Gaza Strip, where unemployment is rife, as she is no longer able to work in the local kindergarten.  Antique collector Hazem Muhanna, 62, said the destruction of his home in an Israeli strike on Gaza City ""destroyed our dreams and our future"".  Story continues  ""If they destroyed my house and five other houses, it would be easier on me than destroying the antiques and artefacts that I cherish,"" said Muhanna, holding up old bank notes and an engraved jug recovered from the ruins.  A retired security guard, Muhanna had for decades used part of his salary to collect antiques and display them in his home ""like a museum"".  His elderly mother sat on a plastic chair in the narrow alley, while his young relatives endeavoured to find more of Muhanna's collectables.  Muhanna said his brother received a call one night from Israeli forces warning him to evacuate the home before they bombed it.  ""I don't know why (the house was targeted). My daughters and sons were here -- 50 people were in the house,"" he said.  Multiple children and civilians were among 33 people killed in Gaza, while one Israeli and a Gazan labourer were killed in Israel.  - 'We're not living' -  Israel's military said it had endeavoured to warn Gazans of their impending bombardment.  ""Buildings were not attacked until they were fully evacuated of civilian population,"" it said in a statement.  Mohammed Sarsour, 29, was weeks away from his wedding and had just finished preparing his apartment for married life when his neighbour told him they were about to be bombed.  ""Then I went home and I couldn't find anything. No window, no bedroom or door,"" he said, in the central Deir al-Balah district.  Broken glass and debris now fill the apartment, while there are deep cracks and gaping holes in the wall.  Sarsour works in a bakery and said he had saved up for years but, with his meagre earnings, he had still taken on debts to renovate the apartment and buy appliances.  ""I'm devastated. I have nothing left to do in my life,"" said Sarsour, whose damaged home looks out onto the rubble of buildings hit by an Israeli strike.  Although a ceasefire has largely held since Saturday, he expected only renewed violence after multiple wars fought across Gaza's borders in recent years.  ""Every two months or a year there's a war,"" he said. ""We're not living.""  bur-rsc/ami/dv","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vdWsubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vZ2F6YW4tbGl2ZXMtaG9tZXMtbGVmdC1zaGF0dGVyZWQtMTUwMTI3NDUyLmh0bWzSAVFodHRwczovL3VrLm5ld3MueWFob28uY29tL2FtcGh0bWwvZ2F6YW4tbGl2ZXMtaG9tZXMtbGVmdC1zaGF0dGVyZWQtMTUwMTI3NDUyLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

D-backs pitcher Zac Gallen was throwing a side session in the outfield ahead of Arizona’s game against the Oakland Athletics in California on Wednesday and managed to inadvertently hit a passing bird with a throw.  Unfortunately, the bird reportedly did not survive the encounter, which saw it being hit by a Gallen curveball.  The incident was caught on camera, with commentators declaring that “Gallen took some time to recognize that” the bird had died.  This comes some 20 years after another infamous avian casualty by throw episode, which saw then Diamondbacks pitcher Randy Johnson take out a bird in a flurry of feathers back in 2001.  Johnson, who was known for his 100+ mph fastballs, was throwing a pitch in the seventh inning of a spring training game when a bird flew by at just the right moment and was hit by the ball, with an explosion of feathers heralding the bird’s unfortunate demise.  It stands to be seen if this year’s incident is a bad omen – Johnson’s Diamondbacks team then went on to win the World Series in a tight seven-game series against the New York Yankees – but Arizona went on to win on Wednesday 5-3 thanks to a ninth inning rally to send them to 25-19 on the season.

"explosion","2023-05-03","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 15:08:29","Wyden Hearing Statement on IRA Tax Incentives to Create Jobs and Investments in Energy Communities  As Prepared for Delivery  The Finance Committee meets this morning for our first hearing on America’s energy transformation since the Inflation Reduction Act became law.  Two years ago, almost to the day, this committee voted on the Clean Energy for America Act. In writing that legislation, our lodestar was developing a technology-neutral, market-oriented energy policy in which the more you reduce carbon emissions, the bigger your tax savings. The old status quo -- big breaks for big oil, and major uncertainty for clean energy -- was holding our economy back and stifling innovation in America.  Since Democrats passed the IRA, there has been an explosion of new investment announced in clean energy projects all over the country. Wind energy, solar, electric vehicle manufacturing, energy storage.  So far those announcements add up to nearly a quarter trillion dollars of private investment coming off the sidelines. Nearly 150,000 jobs created, many of which will not require a college degree. One new analysis broke the announcements down by state. I’ll share a few examples relevant to this committee:  North Carolina, $5.6 billion.  South Carolina, $11 billion.  Ohio, $7.8 billion -- a big chunk of which is solar manufacturing that Senator Brown fought to ensure the bill would make possible.  Texas, $5 billion.  Tennessee, $5.6 billion.  Michigan, $20 billion.  These projects are taking off all over the country, and they have exceeded expectations. These investments help cut carbon emissions. They help prevent the worst climate disasters. And they help fire up the economic engine for entire communities where the shovels are going into the ground.  A big part of our effort in the IRA was giving a special boost to coal towns and other communities built around extractive industry. The status quo failed them. Plants shuttered, and the people in those communities were too often overlooked and forgotten.  When we wrote the Inflation Reduction Act, people in coal towns had no bigger champion than Senator Casey. He worked to create a special program called “energy communities,” which adds a bonus incentive to drive investment in struggling coal towns and areas with similar histories.  Senator Stabenow ensured that those communities would get an additional boost for advanced manufacturing. Senator Cortez Masto made sure the law would also attract investment to communities with areas known as brownfields, which are often the polluted remnants of old industrial facilities.  This work continues a longstanding effort by Finance Committee Democrats to look out for the interests of coal miners and their families. Senator Brown and Senator Casey fought for years to shore up the miners’ health care and pensions. Senator Warner and Senator Carper were also co-sponsors of the bill that got that done.  So colleagues, the IRA is major progress on clean energy that’s just beginning to take off now that the rules pertaining to energy communities were recently put in place.  The catch is, House Republicans want to repeal nearly all of the energy policies in the Inflation Reduction Act. That’s what the McCarthy plan does.  It would be a major act of economic self-sabotage, because a majority of the investments announced since the IRA became law are going to states represented by Republican Senators.  I’ve heard members say that the IRA policies on energy were totally unnecessary, because these clean energy investments would have happened on their own. The reality is, the level of clean energy investment and job creation would not be anywhere near this high without the Inflation Reduction Act. The old system was holding this investment wave back.  Other members claim the IRA is somehow a threat to America’s energy security. Wrong again. The IRA is all about lowering carbon emissions and creating jobs with clean, made-in-America energy. The U.S. will be less reliant on oil and gas, and that means that Americans will be less vulnerable if Vladimir Putin or other adversaries of the United States decide they want to create chaos and hike up prices.  Two years ago, members of this committee showed real guts to pass the bill that kicked off this energy transformation. They cast tough votes. They took on special interests.  And now the Inflation Reduction Act is proving that you can cut carbon emissions and create jobs and opportunity for Americans all at the same time.  I want to thank our witnesses for joining the committee.  ###","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5maW5hbmNlLnNlbmF0ZS5nb3YvY2hhaXJtYW5zLW5ld3Mvd3lkZW4taGVhcmluZy1zdGF0ZW1lbnQtb24taXJhLXRheC1pbmNlbnRpdmVzLXRvLWNyZWF0ZS1qb2JzLWFuZC1pbnZlc3RtZW50cy1pbi1lbmVyZ3ktY29tbXVuaXRpZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

After the Mud Hens struck for a run in the top of the first, Omaha quickly rallied in the bottom half as the first five batters reached, with four runs immediately scoring on two-run homers from Samad Taylor and Logan Porter. Clay Dungan singled home one and Major League rehabber Drew Waters followed with a two-run double, his second hit of the inning and what went on to be four in the game.  Toledo snuck back, scoring runs in the next three innings to eventually knock starter Daniel Lynch out of the game. While Lynch was charged with five runs on nine hits over 3.2 innings, he struck out a season-high eight and did not walk a batter in his third rehab start with Omaha.  Behind Lynch, left-hander Walter Pennington allowed a leadoff single, then retired his next seven batters for 2.1 scoreless innings.  With Pennington keeping the Mud Hens at bay, Omaha's offense got back to work and scored runs in each of its final five innings of at-bats. After Taylor scored in the fourth, Angelo Castellano connected on a two-run homer in the fifth.  In the sixth, Taylor doubled for his second two-bagger and third extra-base hit of the game, came around to score on a Porter single, then Porter scored on Jakson Reetz' second double of the game.  Tyler Gentry singled across two in the seventh, giving all nine Storm Chasers batters at least one hit, then back-to-back doubles from Dungan and Castellano in the eight added two more runs to the scoreboard.  On top of hits from every hitter in the order, eight players scored runs and seven drove in runs, including six multi-hit games, six multi-score games and six multi-RBI games. While 16 runs and 18 hits set season-highs for the club, so did 10 extra-base hits (7 doubles and 3 homers) and 34 total bases.  After Jonah Dipoto pitched a scoreless seventh, the Mud Hens did not go quietly, as Dipoto surrendered a two-run homer in the eight, the second two-run shot of the game from Toledo's Jermaine Palacios. Brooks Kriske got two quick outs in the ninth but two walks and a double scored another run, bringing the game to the 16-8 score that held to be final.  Omaha will try and jump ahead in the series on Thursday as left-hander Austin Cox takes the mound for a 6:35 p.m. CT first pitch.  • Discuss this story on the International League message board...

In her fourth year on council, DeAngelis is a registered nurse, having worked for Trinity Health System for many years, and currently prepares Hancock County students for work in the field as an instructor and Skills USA advisor. She also is a member of St. Anthony Catholic Church.  She said if re-elected, she will work with others “to make sure our community is a safe, healthy place citizens can be proud of. Council is looking at updating present city ordinances and establishing new ones that will be enforced to help better the city.”  DeAngelis said she has supported the acquisition of grants for projects currently in development, including improvements to the city’s water and wastewater treatment systems and renovations to its firehouse and will support the continued search for grants for recreational facilities, such as pickle ball and basketball courts and lighting and restrooms for parks.  She said to prevent young adults from moving from the city, “Economic development is needed and we need to make sure we have the infrastructure to support it.”  “I am here to help with any issues the residents of the 5th Ward have. I am a problem-solver and communicate well with others, which enables me to better serve as a councilwoman.”  Kafton has worked in private industry for 12 years, serving currently as a process safety manager in the oil and gas industry and holds a bachelor’s degree from Eastern Kentucky University in fire and safety engineering.  A 17-year member of the city’s volunteer fire department, he currently serves as second assistant chief and on its executive board.

"explosion","2018-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Toronto"", ""Ontario"", ""Canada""}","Thu 18 May 2023 13:00:00","Open this photo in gallery: Author Kyo Maclear.David Wall/Handout  What happens when you discover that the story of who you are and where you come from is completely different from the one you were told your entire life? That’s the explosive premise at the heart of Unearthing, the new memoir by Toronto writer Kyo Maclear – who, three months after the 2018 death of her father, celebrated foreign correspondent Michael Maclear, received the results of a DNA test showing he wasn’t her biological parent.  Maclear, the author of multiple children’s books, two novels and the Trillium Book Award-winning memoir Birds Art Life, found herself excavating not only her own history, but also that of her mother Yoko (Mariko) Koide – and the roots of their complicated relationship.  The result is a deeply thoughtful meditation on secrets and stories, race and lineage, grief and grace – all told through the narrative of the common language Maclear and her mother, aging and losing her memory, landed on: tending to a shared garden.  As Maclear presses her reluctant mother for answers to the questions that have blown her life wide open, she comes to realize that amid the muddled memories and half-truths also lie lessons in what it takes for new things to grow – patience, pragmatism and a willingness to accept beauty (whether in flowers and plants or the ineffable bonds of family) in all its wild, unruly forms.  How did you land on the non-linear, poetic way of framing what is a very complex narrative?  I decided to structure the book through the passage of seasons and in increments, partly because the way the information was arriving was in these tiny little parcels. We often think of seasons as large, changing blocks of time, but I was more interested in looking at gradients, and how the landscape and scenery was changing in this minuscule way.  In some ways, I created a parallel between the story of my mother and the story of the ambient natural world that I didn’t always pay much attention to but was always the backdrop to everything that was going on in my life. Once you start to think about plants and gardens, you realize that all these things that you underestimated as passive are actually very active agents in the world.  The structure also felt a bit like a garden itself, in the sense that there’s a messiness to it – there’s an attempt to reshape things, but then they fall apart again – it’s just a constant process.  In trying to unravel the mystery of your own family background, what did the idea of kinship come to mean to you?  A close writer friend of mine recently called Unearthing the ultimate “bait-and-switch” – a DNA surprise story that becomes a book about kinship beyond biology and ancestry beyond heredity.  What I hope to convey is that it’s okay to have your coastlines expanded and dissolved. It’s okay to have an identity crisis and grow and change shape – as individuals, families, countries. The conservative, fence-driven logic we are seeing around the world shows what happens when identity hardens and constricts. Xenophobia, anti-migration, fascism – these are all kin-driven patterns. I hope readers are reminded that permeability is a strength, not a weakness.  Many of the people I’ve known in my lifetime have been those who’ve shown me that there are infinite ways of making family. I had to realize actually that’s where my heart is – I don’t really need to redefine myself in relation to a new family.  How did you approach telling a thorny story that wasn’t just your own, but involved many others close to you?  I was very careful in honouring the complexity of people – I didn’t want anything to feel like I was settling scores. I wanted to uplift everyone’s humanity and try to understand why the secret was kept the way it was kept. And one thing I really tried to do was create a context for the story, which is to show that it came out of a social environment, responding to the conventions of the time.  I revealed a set of facts some people once wanted hidden. I tried to do this with a sense of sensitivity rather than swagger. I left a lot out and tried to respect what was not mine to tell. But I also pushed back when I felt energies were being directed at concealment for no good reason – often out of old habits of secrecy and feelings of shame. I wanted to dislodge all of that not just for the sake of piecing together my own story, but to clear the clogged passageways of my family.  What did trying to understand your mother’s history – especially how she was seen and treated under the white, patriarchal gaze as an Asian immigrant woman – tell you about your own experience as someone from a mixed-race background?  I think that as people who are sensitive to language, we have to be a bit more brave about the way we say things. For example, when people talk about interracial marriages, they’ll say things like “cultures bumping up against each other,” as if they were bumper cars or something. When really, I see that in my house there were these racial and gender lines that my mother was dealing with, especially in the time that she moved to Canada in the seventies.  I was thinking about Everything Everywhere All at Once, and I realized that my mother was always kind of wanting an altered version of me, like in the way [the film’s protagonist] Evelyn and her daughter are always misreading each other. We all have these different sliding-door scenarios – and I think that’s compounded when you have a child and you’ve lost some of your previous life’s worlds.  What do you think your mother would take away from the book?  I think she would get a kick out of the way she wins – because I kind of surrender. There is this expectation in memoir that you go through a difficult experience and then you have this epiphany, right? But I didn’t have it – it wasn’t possible to have that for lots of reasons. But in the end, there’s no reckoning and I surrender – that may sound negative, but it was a kind of release; a letting-go. And that had a lot to do with the fact that my mother also had to let go of so many memories. But I think of her as the Houdini of my storytelling – anytime I tried to box her in, she’d escape.  This interview has been edited and condensed.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdsb2JlYW5kbWFpbC5jb20vYXJ0cy9ib29rcy9hcnRpY2xlLWluLXVuZWFydGhpbmcta3lvLW1hY2xlYXItdHVybnMtYW4tZXhwbG9zaXZlLWRpc2NvdmVyeS1pbnRvLWFuL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Knipp’s effort highlighted a strong afternoon session for Class 2A and 3A competitors at the opening day of the state track and field championships at Drake Stadium.  Outside track, Knipp is a four-sport athlete, doing football, rugby and is a state champion wrestler. But according to Knipp, they all have one thing in common.  “All these sports are kind of similar. You have to be explosive and powerful,” Knipp said. “And so it just kind of went along with what I already do and so it just fit into what I am.”  His toss in the blue oval is a personal best, improving on his previous record by three feet. Knipp came into the sport through Head Coach Nick Bellamy, who was his weight-lifting instructor. Impressed by his strength, Bellamy invited him to toss the shot. For Knipp, it was love at first throw. Having set a new PR and finished in the top five on his first try, Knipp is thrilled.  “I feel great today,” Knipp said.  “Some of this is kind of new to me, but it’s cool to be down here,” he added.  Happy with the results, Knipp said he’d be back next year. In the meantime, he’ll have time to practice being explosive in the other sports he loves.  Sauser runs strong: It was also a first for Oelwein sophomore Conall Sauser to run the 3,200-meter race without his older brother Brennan, who graduated last year. It took some adjusting for Sauser, who lost not only his kin, but his rival.  “It was just a lot more fun with my brother,” Sauser said. “He was in most of the races that I was, so we could always push each other. So this year, I kind of had to learn how to push myself without him, which is hard.”  But Sauser found motivation in the other runners around him who admires. Kaden Lynch from Grundy Center was one.  “I started going with really good guys,” he said. “I go with people like that and they get me through it.”  The new motivation seemed to do the trick, putting him in fifth place with a time of 9:59.90 – and improvement of nearly 44 seconds over last year, when he finished 22nd.  Emerson Vokes from Grundy Center finished seventh in the 3,200-meter run with a time of 10:01.2.  Lynch took ninth in 10:01.20 and Denver’s Neal Pinter was 11th in 10:09.30.  Strong run: In preliminaries, Aplington-Parkersburg came in strong for shuttle hurdles, finishing third to qualify for Saturday’s finals with a time of 1:01.4.  “We’re looking forward to it, we ran a PR here, so we’re looking for a PR again, that’s our goal,” said Aidan Junker. “So we just want our best time, we’ve got some people to chase, so that’ll be good for us.”  Junker teammed with Kael Stotler, Nick Neuroth and Kaden Huttinger.

"explosion","1974-05-18","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 11:51:38","Announcing to the world that India had entered an elite group of nations whose members possessed nuclear capabilities, India conducted its first nuclear tests on May 18, 1974, in Pokhran, Rajasthan, as part of the ‘Smiling Buddha’ operation.  Then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi termed the event a “peaceful nuclear explosion”, perhaps to assuage the rest of the world and particularly the members of the United Nations Security Council’s permanent five (or P-5) members: the United States, the United Kingdom, France, China and Russia.  Under what circumstances did India choose to conduct nuclear tests?  The end of World War II in 1945 did not mean an end to the possibility of a large-scale war breaking out. The US and the USSR continued engaging in proxy wars in other countries, for ideological and economic superiority, in what was dubbed the Cold War.  With the US dropping two nuclear bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki towards the end of the war in August 1945, and the Soviet Union carrying out its own nuclear test in 1949, it was decided that certain regulations were required to prevent massive devastation.  To maintain a kind of minimal peace, one such treaty was signed in 1968, called the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). Nuclear-weapon States parties under the NPT are defined as those that manufactured and exploded a nuclear weapon or other nuclear explosive devices before January 1, 1967, effectively meaning the P-5 countries.  Firstly, its signatories agreed not to transfer either nuclear weapons or nuclear weapons technology to any other state. Second, the non-nuclear states agreed that they would not receive, develop or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons.  All of the signatories agreed to submit to the safeguards against proliferation established by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Parties to the treaty also agreed to help end the nuclear arms race and limit the spread of the technology.  Advertisement  However, India objected to this treaty on the grounds that it was discriminatory to countries except the P-5. As per foreign policy researcher Sumit Ganguly, “The government of India refused to accede to the terms of the treaty because it failed to address India’s misgivings”, specifically, the fact that non-nuclear states’ pledge to not develop such weapons was not linked to any such definite obligation on part of the states already possessing nuclear weapons.  Opinion | Why India went nuclear 25 years ago  Domestically, Indian scientists Homi J Bhabha and Vikram Sarabhai had laid the groundwork earlier for nuclear energy to be tested in India. In 1954, the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) was founded, with Bhabha as director.  An early proponent of nuclear energy, Bhabha once wrote, “Moreover, when nuclear energy has been successfully applied for power production in say a couple of decades from now, India will not have to look abroad for its experts but will find them ready at hand.” But then Prime Minister Jawahar Lal Nehru continued being skeptical of nuclear weapons and expanding arms’ acquisition in general.  Advertisement  A change of leadership in the 1960s (with the death of PM Nehru and his successor Morarji Desai), a war with China in 1962 that India lost, and wars with Pakistan in 1965 and 1971, both won by India, changed the direction of India’s plans. China also conducted its tests in 1964.  How did Pokhran-I happen?  Unlike Nehru, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi did not hold a negative view of nuclear tests. But given the treaties that the P-5 had in place, India decided to conduct its tests without any prior information being released to the world.  There was uncertainty even till the end, according to an account detailed by political commentator Inder Malhotra. “Raja Ramanna, the mastermind of the venture [Atomic Energy Commission Chairman], two of Indira Gandhi’s top advisers, PN Haksar and PN Dhar, were opposed to it, and wanted it postponed. Homi Sethna, chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, offered no opinion. D Nag Chaudhuri, Scientific Adviser to the Defence Minister, started weighing pros and cons but was cut short by the prime minister. ‘Dr. Ramanna,’ she said, turning to him, ‘please go ahead. It would be good for the country’. The next morning, the Buddha smiled,” he wrote.  A nuclear device was detonated, with a yield of 12-13 kiloton of TNT, on May 18, 1974. Pokhran, an army test range located in the desert of western Rajasthan, was chosen. A team of around 75 researchers and scientists were involved. Its code name came from the test’s date being on the same day as Buddha Jayanti, the birth date of Gautam Buddha.  And what happened after the tests?  India demonstrated to the world that it could defend itself in an extreme situation and chose not to immediately weaponise the nuclear device it tested at Pokhran. This was to happen only after 1998’s Pokhran-II tests.  Advertisement  But before that, it would face significant criticism from many countries.  In 1978, US President Jimmy Carter signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act, following which the US ceased exporting nuclear assistance to India. The US view on India testing such technologies would only shift on July 18, 2005, when US President George W Bush and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh first announced their intention to enter into a nuclear agreement in Washington.  Advertisement  The US also pushed for setting up a club of nuclear equipment and fissile material suppliers. The 48-nation Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) would go on to implement agreed rules for exporting nuclear equipment, with a view to controlling the spread of nuclear weapons and where members would be admitted only by consensus.  India has been trying, since 2008, to join the group, which would give it a place at the high table where the rules of nuclear commerce are decided — and, eventually, the ability to sell equipment. Many countries that initially opposed its entry, like Australia, have changed stance; Mexico and Switzerland are the latest to voice support. India’s effort has been to chip away at the resistance, leaving only one holdout — China.  Advertisement  This was one reason as to why India did not immediately go for the next step, that of the testing a nuclear bomb, doing so only in 1998. Then too, the international reaction was criticical, but over the years India has projected itself as a “responsible” owner of these weapons, allowing acceptance among countries and into groups like the NSG.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvZXhwbGFpbmVkL2V4cGxhaW5lZC1oaXN0b3J5L29wZXJhdGlvbi1zbWlsaW5nLWJ1ZGRoYS1udWNsZWFyLWZpcnN0LXRlc3QtcG9raHJhbi1oaXN0b3J5LTg2MTY3MTQv0gGHAWh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9leHBsYWluZWQvZXhwbGFpbmVkLWhpc3Rvcnkvb3BlcmF0aW9uLXNtaWxpbmctYnVkZGhhLW51Y2xlYXItZmlyc3QtdGVzdC1wb2tocmFuLWhpc3RvcnktODYxNjcxNC9saXRlLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

""One of the ways they were able to do that is with empty sets, with spread offense concepts. Here's a way the New Orleans Saints could add that in.""

The alerts extended to all regions of the country for about an hour from 2 a.m. (2300 GMT).  But there were no reports of strikes on infrastructure or civilian targets and no indications of casualties as the alerts were withdrawn in Kyiv and in central and southern regions.  Air raid alerts remained in force into the early morning throughout western Ukraine, but only in two regions in the east and Russian-annexed Crimea in the south.  The head of Kyiv's military administration said Russian forces had sent successive waves of drones towards the capital, the 10th attack this month and the second in less than 24 hours.  ""This Kremlin tactic is an attempt to overwhelm our anti-aircraft forces and put psychological pressure on civilians. It won't happen!"" Serhiy Popko wrote on Telegram.  ""All air targets sent toward Kyiv were destroyed by our anti-aircraft defences.""  Several regions reported anti-aircraft units in operation.  Explosions were reported in widely separated regions, including Kriviy Rih in central Ukraine and Rivne and Lutsk in the west.  Ukraine's military had said on Telegram that Russian aircraft were in the air and there was a threat of strikes from hypersonic Kinzhal missiles. An earlier military statement said some airborne targets had been downed, but gave no details.  The military had warned that central regions and Kyiv were at risk from drones.

"explosion","2019-04-03","Not Discerned","{""SanFrancisco"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","Fri 19 May 2023 02:18:16","San Francisco officials are opening a new investigation aimed at Twitter’s Mid-Market headquarters after an explosive lawsuit from former senior employees alleged numerous instances where members of owner Elon Musk’s team knowingly broke local and federal laws.  The six former employees say Twitter didn’t pay promised severance and that Musk’s team instructed staff to disable lights and install locks that wouldn’t open during an emergency at employee bedrooms at 1355 Market St., violating building codes.  “Twitter’s new leadership deliberately, specifically, and repeatedly announced their intentions to breach contracts, violate laws, and otherwise ignore their legal obligations,” the six former employees alleged in a lawsuit filed Tuesday in Delaware federal court.  The suit names Twitter’s successor company X Corp. and Musk as defendants. Twitter, which laid off its communications team, auto-replied to an emailed request for comment with a poop emoji.  “We will be opening a new complaint and conducting an investigation into these new allegations,” Patrick Hannan, a spokesperson for the city’s Department of Building Inspection, told The Chronicle.  Plaintiff Joseph Killian, the former Twitter lead project manager of global design and construction, described Musk’s team allegedly telling him to violate building codes as part of creating rooms for tired employees to sleep in.  In addition to installing beds, Killian said he was told to disconnect motion-sensitive lights because they were bothering people trying to sleep, despite Twitter’s landlord rejecting that request. He said he hired an electrician to do so, allegedly violating both the building code and Twitter’s lease.  Killian also said he was told to install space heaters, violating the lease, and install door locks that “were not compliant with life safety and egress codes” because they wouldn’t automatically unlock in case of fire or earthquake.  Killian said that doing so would block “first responders from being able to access the rooms” in case of emergency, but that Musk’s team wanted cheaper locks that wouldn’t automatically unlock.  “Nobody cared,” the lawsuit stated. “Killian quit that day.” The lawsuit alleges that non-compliant locks were later installed by someone else.  Killian said that he was told not to detail these planned changes when city inspectors visited the building in December.  “When the city inspectors came to inspect the hotel rooms, they expressed surprise and relief to Killian, saying, ‘This is just furniture! We expected more drastic changes,’ ” according to the lawsuit.  The city previously ruled Twitter needed to update a building permit to come into compliance and allow for areas for workers to sleep in. But six months after the bedroom investigation started, the permit has not been approved.  The other five plaintiffs include Wolfram Arnold, a former staff software engineer; Erik Froese, former software engineering senior manager; Tracy Hawkins, who led Twitter’s real estate division; Laura Chan Pytlarz, former global strategy lead of food and events; and Andrew Schlaikjer, former senior staff machine learning engineer. They couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.  Hawkins said she quit after Twitter stopped paying vendors or its office landlords, an alleged move that has also sparked numerous lawsuits, including from Shorenstein, Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters landlord. Twitter had over $130 million in annual office rent obligations, according to the lawsuit.  “Elon told me he would only pay rent over his dead body,” Musk adviser Pablo Mendoza allegedly told Hawkins, according to the lawsuit.  The lawsuit alleges that Musk’s attorney Alex Spiro “loudly opined that it was unreasonable for Twitter’s landlords to expect Twitter to pay rent, since San Francisco was a s— hole.”  Arnold, Froese, Pytlarz and Schlaikjer allege that they were fired and not paid “contractually required severance.”  The plaintiffs are seeking severance, punitive damages for “flagrant bad faith,” alleged fraud and alleged violation of local and federal laws.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS9iYXlhcmVhL2FydGljbGUvcy1mLW9wZW5pbmctbmV3LXR3aXR0ZXItaW52ZXN0aWdhdGlvbi1leC13b3JrZXJzLTE4MTA3NjMzLnBocNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"explosion","2022-07-27","00:00:00","{""Huson"", ""Montana"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 13:19:39","Brandon Guffey's 17-year-old son Gavin died by suicide after he said Gavin fell victim to a sexual extortion scheme online, and now he's fighting to protect other kids from this crime.  Sexual extortion, or ""sextortion,"" is a form of blackmail where victims are lured into sending explicit images online and then threatened to do something they don't want to do, like send more photos or money.  ""I tell people all the time, Gavin was not depressed,"" Guffey told ABC News. ""He was, in my opinion, living his best life before he took his own.""  Now, the Republican state lawmaker from Rock Hill, South Carolina, is pushing through a piece of legislation (H 3583) that would criminalize sextortion in the state. It passed the state house and senate and will head to the governor's desk soon.  Under the proposed law, perpetrators who extort minors or at-risk adults could face up to 20 years in prison. According to Guffey, elevating these crimes to felonies will also give law enforcement the ability to cross state lines to chase down alleged perpetrators.  An increase in reported cases  Thorn, an organization dedicated to ending the sexual exploitation of children, started tracking this type of online grooming pre-pandemic and said it saw a ""dramatic increase in reports"" during the pandemic and in recent months.  Between 2019 and 2021, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children said the number of reports made to its organization involving the sextortion of children or teens more than doubled.  ""I don't know that we necessarily armed our children with the tools that they needed to be safe in the face of this type of extortion or built our platforms in a way that would create a safe environment,"" Thorn's CEO Julie Cordua told ABC News.  In early 2023, the FBI issued a national public safety alert regarding an ""explosion in incidents of children and teens being coerced."" According to the FBI, law enforcement agencies saw 3,000 minor victims targeted in 2022, with the majority of them being boys.  In most reported cases, experts said the first contact is made through social media where young male victims are led to believe they are exchanging messages with a girl their own age.  Guffey told ABC News that Gavin received an Instagram message on July 27, 2022, from an account posing as a teenage girl, just around midnight. About an hour and a half after that first contact, Gavin took his own life.  Gavin Guffey, 17, from Rock Hill, S.C., seen here in an undated file photo was a one-of-a-kind guy his dad told ABC News. Courtesy Guffey family  ""I refused to believe it at first. There's no way that he could have been under that much stress that quickly that it would have caused this decision,"" Guffey said  In the weeks following Gavin's funeral, Guffey said various family members received dozens of threatening Instagram messages demanding money to keep the explicit images private. That's when Guffey connected the dots and uncovered what had pushed his son to suicide.  ""Did I tell you your son begged for his life,"" read one of the Instagram messages, according to Guffey.  Gavin's case is still under investigation by local law enforcement, the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, the FBI, and Homeland Security.  ""We support legislation that empowers law enforcement to pursue those who commit the heinous act of sextortion and applaud Representative Guffey’s efforts on this bill. No family should ever have to experience a tragedy like this,"" a Meta spokesperson told ABC News. ""We want teens to have a safe experience on our apps, and we’ve built technology and tools to help protect our users from criminals and scammers of this kind.""  ""We encourage teens and adults to report suspicious or harmful content, activity or accounts in our apps if they feel unsafe, and we take action and will reach out to law enforcement in cases of imminent harm. Teens can also use NCMEC’s Take It Down, a new tool we supported that helps prevent young people’s intimate images from being posted online in the future,"" Meta's statement continued.  Experts said the number of young victims impacted is likely much larger than reported because many do not come forward.  ""I believe we've got to start wearing our shame as adults if we want our kids to understand that it's okay,"" to ask for help, said Guffey, who decided with his wife to share Gavin's story in order to raise public awareness.  And that's exactly what happened when Christina and Jason Scheffer, from Huson, Montana, heard about Gavin's case.  Waylon Scheffer is shown in this undated photo is described by his family as a true Montana boy who loved fishing and hunting. Kelsey Farago Photography  Their son, Waylon Scheffer, was just 16 years old when they say scammers drove him to take his own life on Dec. 14, 2022. The Scheffers said talking with Guffey helped them understand the intricacies of how scammers used social media to prey on their own teenage son.  ""I got your nude,"" reads one of the threatening messages sent to Waylon and reviewed by ABC News. ""I will start sending your nude and put it on the newspaper, and make sure I make life miserable for you.""  Waylon's case is still under investigation by local law enforcement.  Waylon and Gavin are among the more than a dozen American teenage boys who have lost their lives after being threatened and extorted online this past year, said the FBI.  ""The best advice that I give that I think to give parents is to not allow your children to have any of their devices in private rooms such as bathrooms and bedrooms,"" Guffey said.  Out of the darkness  ""The greatest harm will be if the perpetrator wins because the child is ashamed and afraid,"" Cordua said. She told ABC News that creating a blame-free space will help your child feel safe enough to come forward if something goes wrong.  ""Talk about this stuff,"" agreed Jason Scheffer, who had spoken to his son on multiple occasions about these types of scams.  And since Waylon's passing, Scheffer said his school will introduce a phone safety training class for both parents and students.  As part of Guffey's bill, school districts will also be required to educate students about sextortion on an annual basis.  ""This is the best part of the bill, in my opinion, because the hardest thing to do is to raise awareness to get parents and students talking about this,"" said Guffey.  What about the platforms  Experts said disappearing messages on WhatsApp, Instagram and Snapchat create a false sense of security. Because of these features, a teen may feel more comfortable sharing an explicit image, but experts said scammers often record the conversation.  Snapchat and Instagram notify users if another user takes screenshots or screen-recording their chat, but this doesn't stop perpetrators from finding workarounds.  ""Any form of sexual exploitation is abhorrent and illegal and we have dedicated teams that work closely with authorities, experts, and industry partners to combat it,"" a Snapchat spokesperson told ABC News.  ""We have extra protections in place on Snapchat for under 18s that make it harder for them to be discovered and contacted by people they don't know,"" the spokesperson added.  Gavin Guffey pictured with his dad Brandon, his mom, and his two younger brothers is seen here in an undated file photo. Courtesy Guffey family  Cordua said that platforms are sitting on troves of data that could help inform how to add more protections for all users. For example, if an account is flagged by multiple users, especially young users, that should raise a flag on the platform side.  ""There's a pattern in this data, and so platforms have the ability to see what is happening and identify where the risk factors are on their platform,"" she added. Cordua said they could consider adding a few more ""road bumps"" that would help pull young people out of conversations with adults.  Parents said they want to see the platforms do more to protect their children from online predators. ""I firmly believe they are letting this terrorism happen across their platform,"" said Jason Scheffer. ""They're not doing anything about it.""

"explosion","2023-05-18","10:00:00","{""Independence"", ""Missouri"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 14:12:00","Profitable Bootstrapped Business Model Succeeds Amid Volatile VC/PE Funding Market  INDEPENDENCE, Ohio, May 18, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Contract Guardian, Inc. (CG), a leading provider of SaaS healthcare contract lifecycle management software, today announced that its revenues and net earnings have tripled over the past four years. The company credits organic growth to a combination of unwavering focus on solving client contract management challenges with hardened entrepreneurial bootstrapping business lessons learned over 34 years. This contrasts with the typical SaaS-company growth model of venture capital, private equity funding, or merger/acquisition that tends to favor additional growth over all else.  Contract Guardian Logo  The contract management software market is growing rapidly with revenues expected to reach nearly $3.6 billion by the end of 2028 on a compound annual growth rate of 12%, according to Verified Market Research. Growth is driven by a changing regulatory landscape, increasing contract complexity, and the drive by healthcare organizations to reduce costs.  ""Large healthcare organizations may have more than 30,000 contracts to manage,"" Matt Paterini, PharmD and VP Contract Guardian said, ""and many diverse types, including agreements with vendors, payers, employees, leasing firms, affiliates, and contract physicians just to name a few. Different departments tend to operate in silos making contract management an even greater challenge.""  Contract Guardian's successes are attributed to the software's ease of use, responsive interface, custom workflows, and automatic notifications, among other features. For example, notifications alone can help organizations realize significant savings by alerting administrators to events such as automatic renewals, which can bind organizations to a contract long after goods or services are required. Contract Guardian is also distinctive in its laser focus on healthcare and the tailored configuration that goes into each customer's implementation.  Story continues  More recently, the firm has benefited from the increased involvement of CEO Jim Kandrac in Contract Guardian's growth strategy. Kandrac started and scaled UCG Technologies over 34 years into a technology services firm spanning thirty-one states, Canada, and the Caribbean. Since the December 2021 sale of UCG Technologies, Kandrac has focused his energies on growing Contract Guardian which he purchased in 2018. Contract Guardian's Vice President Matt Paterini, whose healthcare background includes a Doctor of Pharmacy degree and extensive health system administration experience is invaluable in leading the day-to-day operations.  Kandrac explains, ""Contract Guardian is uniquely positioned in the CLM marketplace to address hospital business issues and pains. The solution was initially developed for a multinational health system 16 years ago and has been continuously enhanced since. The combination of longevity coupled with our team's healthcare expertise makes for a winning combination for hospital clients.""  The company has also benefited from consolidation in its own market, with one of its leading competitors having recently been acquired by a provider of healthcare governance, risk, and compliance software. The result within those acquired has been ""increased pricing, increased system downtime, and lack of support,"" Paterini said. Contract Guardian inquiries have increased by over 30% in the past nine months.  With CG renewal rates of better than 96% and customers who range from small rural institutions to multinational giants, Contract Guardian's SaaS solution and ""Train the Trainer"" onboarding approach has proven itself in a wide range of use healthcare scenarios.  ""We're distinctive in being solely focused on healthcare,"" Paterini said. ""You don't need an IT degree to use our software and each onboarding comes with expertise from client consultants who know hospitals and have collaborated with them for many years.""  The privately-owned company has hospital clients in forty-four states, is profitable, and is in business to solve client problems, issues, and pains having ingrained successful business principles from the history of UCG Technologies. ""CG isn't a software company chasing revenue and customers at the expense of our existing clients,"" Paterini said. ""I suppose you could say CG's not an exciting Silicon Valley startup, but with a tripling of business and no requirement for debt or PE/VC dollars, it's a great place to be.""

Apparently, for the long-rumored Apple VR/AR headset, consistency might not be the case.  A lengthy report from Bloomberg (opens in new tab) discusses the monumental moment that could be coming at WWDC 2023, where Apple is expected to reveal its Reality Pro headset and xrOS interface in front of developers. According to the report, the headset is not only far from the original vision, but is ‘un-Apple-like’ in more ways than one.  In fact, consultant and former Apple exec Michael Gartenberg says the Apple headset could be “one of the great tech flops of all time.""  Perhaps the most uncharacteristic thing is the Apple VR/AR headset price. Apple devices aren’t strangers to premium price tags, but with multiple tips pointing to a $3,000 cost, this headset will make the best VR headsets look cheap. What’s more, the company is “reported to be planning to sell Reality Pro at a breakeven cost.” For comparison, Apple usually makes a 37% margin on its products.  Similarly, Apple has lowered headset sales hopes from 3 million units to 900,000 units. On average, the company sells past 200 million iPhones per year, so the headset is not expected to become as ubiquitous as other Apple products. At least, not at first. If the company adds new features and lowers the price down for next-gen versions, internal projections suggest the headset will reach Apple Watch-level adoption.  A world-facing display (and external battery)  Apple is hoping an external display will warm people up to the product by keeping “wearers engaged with the real world.” The headset will reportedly feature a world-facing display that demonstrates eye movements and facial expressions. One of Bloomberg’s sources said this display will let others “interact with a headset wearer without feeling as if they’re talking to a robot.” It’s hard to say without seeing it in action, but it sounds a bit creepy based on the description.  Another reason for the external display is to promote all-day wear. According to the report, the headset may be able to replace tasks otherwise done on iPhones and Macs. Think: gaming, web searching, FaceTiming and even exercising. Apparently, the company also hopes third-party apps will help with the headset’s popularity.  The final “un-Apple-like” element of the headset as it is currently rumored is the external battery. It's difficult to name a modern Apple product that lacks intuition, so the expectation that wearers will have to awkwardly tote around an external battery tethered to the headset sounds very off-brand. Even if the headset comes bundled with a chic battery carrying pack, the setup seems like it would still lack grace.  Will Apple Reality Pro be a letdown?  Based on this Bloomberg report, the VR headset we'll see at WWDC has strayed far from the company's original vision and will need more time to marinate in the market than other Apple devices. Apples foray into mixed reality could certainly make the category as a whole more mainstream, but it seems like some sacrifices have been made along the way.  That said, there are ways the Apple headset can prove skeptics wrong. Beyond reports of 'far exceeding' the capabilities of competing headsets, a controller-less experience, brilliant AR pass-through and the power of Apple silicon could all help to generate excitement for the Reality Pro.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNndWlkZS5jb20vbmV3cy9hcHBsZS1yZWFsaXR5LXByby1oZWFkc2V0LXNvdW5kcy1saWtlLXRoZS1tb3N0LXVuLWFwcGxlLWxpa2UtZGV2aWNlLWluLW5ldy1yZXBvcnTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Video / NZ Herald  Rocket Lab chief executive Peter Beck has concerns for his main competitor Elon Musk’s regard for safety, but other than that, says Musk’s “just a guy”.  Speaking to Markets with Madison from California, where his Kiwi-founded rocket launching company is now based, Beck said the new rocket his company was building, named Neutron, would go “head to head” with Musk’s SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.  Neutron is a direct competitor to a SpaceX’s Falcon 9.  “So, that’s certainly a little bit more of a heads to heads approach,” Beck said.  SpaceX was currently testing its super-heavy Starship rocket - it exploded in its first test flight in April.  Beck found one thing “terribly surprising” about that test.  “The flight termination system took 40 seconds to activate, which is is very concerning generally.  “When you terminate a rocket, it should be instantaneous, not nearly a minute later. So, I think that they’re gonna have to do some work to solve that problem.”  Beck proudly stated that Rocket Lab was the only rocket provider to have successfully launched and place satellites into orbit this year - it was seeing more customers such as Nasa to come to it with missions as a result.  “We’ve established ourselves as the the most reliable small launch vehicle, with the second most frequently launched rocket behind SpaceX.”  Watch Beck’s interview in today’s episode of Markets with Madison above.

House on fire in Frederick following tanker truck explosion (Photo from Frederick County Fire & Rescue Services)  Frederick, Md (KM) The Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration will install guardrails along a three-mile stretch of US Route 15 in Frederick. The work is expected to take place this coming Sunday through Thursday, May 21st to May 25th. The hours will be from 10:00 PM to 5:00 AM.  Andrew Ratcliffe, the District 7 Engineer for Frederick, Carroll and Howard Counties, says this project follows the fatal tanker truck crash, explosion and fire in March along Route 15 near Apple Avenue in Frederick. He notes that guardrails were installed near the crash site shortly after that incident. “Immediately after the tanker crash, we looked to address that area along Apple Avenue. So we installed guardrail from the spot where the Rosemont Avenue entrance ramp ties into US 15 northbound,” he says. “And then ran along Apple Avenue and connected to the existing guardrail that was there that kind of ran up to the bridge over West 7th Street.”  The tanker explosion and fire burned the vegetation along Route 15 near Apple Avenue, and did extensive damage to a nearby house. The tanker truck driver was the only fatality from the accident. No one else was injured. The tanker was carrying gasoline.  MDOT SHA says crews will close the shoulder and right lane of northbound US Route 15 at Jefferson Street. The Guardrail will be installed along northbound US 15 between Jefferson Street and the exit ramp to eastbound US 40; northbound US 15 between 7th Street and Motter Avenue; the ramp from Motter Avenue onto southbound US 15; the ramp from eastbound US 40 to southbound US 15; and southbound US 15 between the Opposumtown Pike ramp and the 7th Street exit ramp.  The work is expected to be completed by the end of next week, weather permitting, says MDOT SHA.  Ratcliffe says guardrails protect an errant vehicle from leaving the road and possibly getting into a bad crash. But he says there are other considerations MDOT SHA must think about before erecting guardrails. :”While it protects the roadside, the guardrails can make what could be a simple single vehicle crash and could make it more serious as the guardrail is a hazard,” says Ratcliffe. “But it can also redirect vehicles into traffic. So these are factors we kind of have to weigh.”  Motorists who will be traveling that area of US Route 15 during the overnight hours next week are urged to be patient, and pay attention to their driving while in the work zone.  MDOT SHA also says this project is separate from the widening of US Route 15 in Frederick which is fully funded, with construction scheduled to begin in 2026.

"explosion","2023-05-18","Not Discerned","{""Bath"", ""BathAndNorthEastSomerset"", ""UnitedKingdom""}","Thu 18 May 2023 09:30:00","The last day of the school year at Bath Consolidated School on May 18, 1927, turned tragic after an explosion rocked the school, killing 38 students and three adults and injuring 50. The attack was perpetrated by school board member Andrew Kehoe, who was displeased by the rising taxes brought on by the new school, and sour over losing a public election.  Almost 100 years later, the Bath School disaster remains the deadliest school attack in United States history. The son of two people who survived the dynamite attack talked about what happened that day, and what we can learn from it.  Bath Consolidated School ""The Bath School Disaster"" by M.J. Ellsworth  The day of the explosion  George Robson grew up in Bath, a small town northwest of Lansing. His parents, Byron and Arlene, were students at Bath Consolidated School at the time of the disaster. Byron Robson was the senior class president and valedictorian anxious for his graduation ceremony later that week. Arlene Dreyer was nearing the end of her sophomore year.  Advertisement  “They’d had two dates up until that point. My mother was very excited because she was going to be his special date at commencement the upcoming Saturday,” George Robson said.  “They had a budding relationship at that point. That day accentuated everything they were going through.”  Just before the explosion, Byron was walking down the second floor hallway of the school. He passed Arlene’s classroom and waved through the glass door. Arlene was working on a paper, and Byron was headed to the church next door where the graduation ceremony was set to take place.  “She turns back to write her paper, and there’s a sudden shudder, and the lights start swinging from the ceiling and the air fills with dust. She looks out the doors where my dad had just walked down the hallway, and there’s blue sky, and there’s no school there,” Robson said.  Advertisement  Her teacher that day was Supt. Emroy E. Huyck. After the explosion, Huyck instructed students not to panic or attempt to jump from the second-story windows. They complied and were rescued when Consumers Energy - which was doing work in town that week - arrived with ladders to help the students escape.  Superintendent Emroy E. Huyck “The Bath School Disaster” by M.J. Ellsworth  “My mother was able to get out, climb down and walk around the other side of the school. She finds that her sister is okay. She was in part of the school that was not affected,” Robson said.  She decided to walk home, which was about three blocks from the school. As she started to cross the road, she saw Andrew Kehoe approaching the school in his Model T.  “She thought he’s coming in to help because he’s on the school board. He knew all about electricity and plumbing and building and everything. So she waits for him to turn and she crosses the road,” Robson said.  Advertisement  As she did, she could see the Kehoe farm on fire about a mile down the road. She then thought Kehoe could be coming to town for help.  “She goes to open the door for her house right there. There’s another shudder, and a piece of steel came through the picture window. That’s when (Kehoe) had driven up to school and blown up his car,” Robson said.  The Bath School after the explosion ""The Bath School Disaster"" By M.J. Ellsworth  The creation of Bath Consolidated School  Bath Consolidated School opened in November 1922. The school replaced a collection of one-room schoolhouses in the area, and educated K-12 students. The 1926 Census counted 314 scholars at the school. For a community the size of Bath, creating a consolidated school was quite the big deal at the time. The school provided transportation and organized education, unlike the small country one-room schoolhouses of the age.  Taxes paid by the community helped build and keep the school functioning. In 1922, they were $12.26 on a thousand dollar valuation; by 1926, they reached $19.80.  Advertisement  Who is Andrew Kehoe?  Andrew P. Kehoe was born Feb. 1, 1872, near Tecumseh, Michigan. One of 13 children, his mother died when he was young. In time his father remarried. Kehoe was not fond of his stepmother, and her fate was a prelude of what would come to those close to Kehoe.  One day when Kehoe was about 14, his stepmother returned home from running errands and proceeded to light their oil stove in the kitchen. The stove had been tampered with, and it exploded, saturating her with oil and setting her ablaze. At first Andrew just stared at her, watching her burn. Then he grabbed a pail of water and threw it on her, exacerbating the situation. She later died from her injuries. Though there was never any trouble made about it, neighbors familiar with the family were of the belief that Andrew knew something was awry with the stove.  Kehoe gradated from Tecumseh High School, then took an electrical engineering course at Michigan State College. While in college he met his future wife, Nellie Price.  Later Kehoe purchased the Price family farm in Bath. Though he was technically a farmer, Kehoe chronically mismanaged his land. He did not follow the traditional practices of the time but rather tried to do every ounce of work with a tractor.  The book titled “The Bath School Disaster” by M.J. Ellsworth covers the story of Andrew Kehoe, the Bath community and the victims’ lives in great detail.  “No matter how much Kehoe worked on machinery, he was never seen dirty or greasy. If he got greasy, he would go to the house and clean up,” Ellsworth wrote.  At the time, farmers often used dynamite to move stumps and boulders from their fields. Kehoe was known for his frequent use of the explosive for stump blasting.  Kehoe Home ""The Bath School Disaster"" By M.J. Ellsworth  After moving to Bath in the spring of 1919, Kehoe and his neighbors - the Hartes - had a friendly relationship. Mrs. Harte often took Nellie on errands since the Kehoes were without a car in those years. But that friendliness didn’t last long.  “Mrs. Harte had a little fox terrier dog of which she thought a great deal, but it had a habit of running out on the lawn and barking. It never went into the road. It came up missing in March, 1920, and they looked all over the farm for it, but they couldn’t find it. She went over and asked Mr. Kehoe if he had seen anything of her dog. He said that it was burying a bone beside his road fence and he shot the d- nuisance. The dog never went into Kehoe’s yard, but it must have annoyed him by barking on the lawn,” wrote M.J. Ellsworth.  In 1922, Kehoe began to complain about taxes being too high. In 1923, the school board bought five acres for an athletic field and electricity purposes. Taxes went up to $18.80 for that year. This enraged Kehoe. He told neighbors if he were to join the school board, he would cut down the taxes. At an annual school meeting in 1924, Kehoe was nominated and elected to act as trustee for a term of three years. He was appointed treasurer for a one-year period.  During this time, he had considerable trouble with the rest of the school board, as he refused to give or take on any subject. He wanted his way, and if there were disagreements, he would make a motion to adjourn the sessions. He very rarely voted the same as other members on the school board.  He felt serious animosity toward Supt. Huyck. Many times he tried to have him fired, dismissed him from meetings and even attempted to refuse him any vacation time.  In the spring of 1925, the elected township clerk died. The township board appointed Kehoe to act as clerk until the election the following spring. At that election, Kehoe ran for the position and was defeated, likely due to his behavior on the school board.  Losing the election - coupled with his disdain for the school taxes - proved to be the last straw, and he soon forged a plan to destroy all he could.  The explosions  On the day of the disaster, Kehoe set off almost concurrent explosions at his farm and at Bath Consolidated School. His devices destroyed the farm’s buildings and the north wing of the school building.  “He was going to have his way at any cost,” Ellsworth wrote. “He cut wire fences on the farm and put dynamite in his tractor so that it blew all to pieces while the tool shed was burning. All the stock he had at this time was two horses. They were tied in the barn and their feet were wired together so that rescuing them during the fire would be impossible.”  During the summer of 1926, Kehoe did repair work at the school, allowing him unsupervised extended access to the premises, and affording him knowledge of the building. Kehoe was able to hide dynamite in the lower floors of the school.  The last board meeting he attended was May 5, 1927, just 13 days before the tragedy.  Kehoe Home after fire ""The Bath School Disaster"" By M.J. Ellsworth  As rescuers began working at the school after the first explosion, Kehoe drove up to the schoolyard. He had filled his car with dynamite as well as farming tools, metal and nails to act as shrapnel. He shot at the pile, triggering an explosion that killed Kehoe plus four others, including Huyck.  During the rescue and recovery efforts, searchers discovered an additional 500 pounds of unexploded dynamite in the south wing of the school.  Explosives found in Bath School ""The Bath School Disaster"" By M.J. Ellsworth  Note left by Kehoe “The Bath School Disaster” by M.J. Ellsworth  The aftermath  Many families lost children that day. In a tragedy of this magnitude, moving on looks different for everyone involved. For George Robson’s parents, silence was the easiest way.  “You can imagine how traumatic it was. Thirty-eight small children are killed in this school, on the last day of school, and it could have been the entire school because they ended up taking out over 500 pounds of dynamite that did not go off. But they never talked about it,” Robson said. “They moved on to their careers. My mother became a very successful teacher for the rest of her life. My dad had various other jobs. I’m sure it affected them emotionally, tremendously. But boy, it didn’t stop them from doing what they were intending to do with their lives.”  Robson speculates his parents never talked about the incident because they - and the country at large - had experienced a lot of turmoil in their childhood. World War I, the Spanish Flu and then the school disaster were events that affected them deeply and that became opportunities to become stronger.  Today, Robson gives presentations at libraries, universities and community events to tell the story of the Bath School disaster in hopes that people won’t forget the resiliency of the small Michigan town. The violence experienced in schools today is frequently mentioned by patrons.  “There was a distinct and concrete effort to move on, and to never talk about it after,” Robson said about the Bath School Disaster.  “What comes up sometimes in these presentations is, ‘How can we talk about the gun violence in schools now?’ ” Robson said. “The main thing I concentrate on is the fact that he had a psychopathic personality, and he never should have had access to deadly materials.  “We have that in our current culture, and we can address that, like we did with that subject, we could have great success with it.

The Shiba Inu cryptocurrency project, rooted in the popular Shiba Inu dog meme, presents itself as a rival to Dogecoin and runs on the Ethereum blockchain. The Shiba Inu (SHIB) ecosystem comprises three unique tokens, each serving a particular purpose within the project.  SHIB, as the main token, acts as a decentralized, community-driven currency that is accessible to millions of users around the world. Having launched on the Ethereum blockchain in late 2020, SHIB has since gained global attention and can be used for payment at various locations, either directly or through intermediary services.  BONE serves as the governance token in the ecosystem, with a total supply of 250 million. BONE enables the Shib Army to participate in decision-making by voting on proposals through the Doggy DAO. Additionally, BONE establishes the groundwork for Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s own Layer 2 network.  The third token, LEASH, has a limited supply of 107,646 and offers exclusive benefits to dedicated supporters of the ecosystem. LEASH holders have experienced advantages such as increased BONE rewards for providing liquidity to ShibaSwap, exclusive rights to mint Shiboshi NFTs, and priority access to land sales within the “SHIB: The Metaverse project.”  Shibarium, a layer 2 blockchain, has been developed to overcome Ethereum’s limitations, including slow speeds and high transaction costs. The Shiba Inu project currently has Shibarium in beta testing.  According to BlockScout, as of 7:10 p.m on May 18, 2023, Shibarium beta, affectionately known as “Puppynet,” has recorded a substantial 9,248,681 transactions since its inception on March 11. This active beta environment’s total block number has reached 880,494 with an impressively brief average block time of only 6.0 seconds. Further signs of growing interest and adoption are visible in the wallet addresses, surpassing 15 million, with the current count at 15,790,876.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyeXB0b2dsb2JlLmNvbS9sYXRlc3QvMjAyMy8wNS9zaGliYXJpdW0tYmV0YS1leHBsb3NpdmUtZ3Jvd3RoLWhpbnRzLWF0LWJyaWdodC1mdXR1cmUtZm9yLXNoaWJhLWludS1zaGliLWVjb3N5c3RlbS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

It boasts a reboot-based story, with Liu Kang having sent the timeline back further than we’ve ever seen it go in franchise history. There’s an all-new fighting system named Kameo, a fresh roster of fighters, and more gore and violent combat than you can shake a stick at. With Mortal Kombat 1 having finally been announced, 2023 officially becomes one of the best years on record for the fighting games esports scene.  We’re mere days away from the launch of Street Fighter 6, and on September 19th, we’ll get access to Mortal Kombat 1. This year, Tekken 8 could also be released, but it may be pushed to early 2024. There are also ongoing rumours circulating of a brand-new product called ‘Disney Domination’, which is supposedly going to be a hyper-ambitious competitor to Super Smash. There’s a new King of Fighters game, the first AEW title, a better-than-ever WWE 2K game, and many more fighting games coming in 2023.  It’s a brilliant year for the fighting scene.  Mortal Kombat 1 Looks Fantastic  It was only an early reveal trailer, but what we’ve seen of Mortal Kombat 1 already looks brilliant. In the video, we’re treated to tranquil scenes that are quickly shattered by intense, graphic violence – and it’s only going to get more brutal as time goes on. There’s the regular line-up of someone of the most recognisable characters and fighters, but this will supposedly be the largest roster in Mortal Kombat history.  There’s also a ‘secondary roster’ of fighters known as ‘Kameo’ characters. New for Mortal Kombat 1, the Kameo system will see players pick AI-controlled characters that can make an appearance at opportune moments during a fight to lend a hand and present collaborative opportunities.  Here’s the trailer:  There Is Always Something Worth Fighting For  This year (and into 2024), fans of fighting games are going to be spoilt for choice. It’s a series of changes that are set to impact the esports scene for fighting games immeasurably, with competitors needing to learn the ropes on three top-tier new titles: Street Fighter 6, Tekken 8, and now Mortal Kombat 1.  There’s better technology powering these games, too. It was recently revealed that Street Fighter 6 will boast rollback netcode, which means that fighting will be as low-latency as possible, making for more accurate combat online – which is a massive win for Street Fighter esports tournaments being played online. It’s a similar story across other platforms, with Tekken 8 and Mortal Kombat 1 both boasting new, advanced, and enhanced features and technology.  For fans of the genre, there will be plenty of titles to pick from going forward. It may be a few years before any of these games resurface again, so it’s best to enjoy them while they’re here and spend a long time perfecting your skills in each game.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG9ydHMubmV0L25ld3MvbW9ydGFsLWtvbWJhdC0xLXJldmVhbGVkL9IBOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG9ydHMubmV0L25ld3MvbW9ydGFsLWtvbWJhdC0xLXJldmVhbGVkLz9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"explosion","2017-12-03","Not Discerned","{""Nashville"", ""Tennessee"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 22:32:00","Jimmie Allen addressed his wife, who is divorcing him, in an Instagram post Thursday afternoon, publicly apologizing to her for what he continues to characterize as a consensual “affair,” and what a woman who used to be one of his managers claims in a lawsuit was sexual assault and rape.  “I want to publicly apologize to my wife, Alexis, for humiliating her with my affair,” Allen writes in the post. “I’m embarrassed that my choices have brought shame on her. That’s something she did not deserve at all. I also want to apologize to my children for being a poor example of a man and a father.” (Allen’s wife is pregnant with their third child; he also has a child from a previous relationship.)  The country star does not mention or allude to the seriousness of the allegations in the lawsuit against him or in an investigative piece published by Variety. He uses his latest statement to characterize his involvement with the Jane Doe in question as “temptations” he was not able to “withstand” as “a victim of my weaknesses.” He also contends “this business” put him in the position of succumbing to weakness.  “This business takes so much from you,” Allen wrote. “It’s full of temptations that can cripple you and ruin everything you’ve built. I’m ashamed that I wasn’t strong enough to withstand them. I will no longer be a victim of my weaknesses.”  In conclusion, Allen said, “I challenge everyone to seek help when they need it. Do not be afraid of your weakness, surround yourself with people that WILL help you. Be Blessed.” He signed off on the message with emoji of praying hands and a clenched fist.  It marked the first substantial public statement Allen had made since he released a statement to Variety just before Jane Doe’s lawsuit went public, at which time he said: “I acknowledge that we had a sexual relationship — one that lasted for nearly two years. During that time, she never once accused me of any wrongdoing, and she spoke of our relationship and friendship as being something she wanted to continue indefinitely. Only after things ended between us, did she hire a lawyer to reach out and ask for money, which leads me to question her motives….”  In response to that statement, Jane Doe’s attorneys denied that she ever asked Allen’s camp for money prior to filing the suit.  In a vaguer, earlier statement this week, Allen had taken to his Instagram Story on Wednesday to post messages with religious overtones. “We Gonna Be Alright. This Too Shall Pass,” Allen wrote, followed by a screenshot of a song by a Christian group, For King & Country, over which he wrote the message “God only knows … He knows!”  (The phrase “We Gonna Be Alright” is a reference to his new single, “Be Alright.” It drops to No. 59 on Billboard’s Country Airplay chart in this, its third charting week, after peaking at No. 57 last week.)  Reaction against Allen has been swift from those who have most recently been working with him. He was suspended from his record company, BBR, his agency, UTA, and his current management company, The Familie. His publicity firm, Full Coverage Communications, terminated business with the star. And the Country Music Association removed him from the bill for the upcoming CMA Music Festival. Allen no longer has any tour dates listed on his website, although Ticketmaster is still selling tickets for a handful of upcoming Allen shows, while others are marked as canceled.  In the civil lawsuit against Allen, his former manager-producer Ash Bowers and Wide Open Music, filed May 11 with the United States District Court of Tennessee, Allen was sued for sexual battery, assault, false imprisonment, sex trafficking and emotional distress. Bowers and Wide Open Music were additionally sued for gross negligence and participating in a venture engaged in sex trafficking, among other counts.  Jane Doe was a young woman who had recently graduated magna cum laude from Vanderbilt University, with a brief stopover at UTA’s Nashville office, when she went to work for Allen’s then-management, Wide Open Music, becoming the star’s day-to-day manager. Doe says she was fired by Bowers in retaliation after bringing an alleged pattern of sexual assault that she says went on for a year and a half to the manager’s attention. Bowers says she was let go because there was no longer a role for her after the company quietly severed ties with Allen after she discussed what was happening with the manager last fall.  In her lawsuit, Jane Doe alleges that Allen raped her while choking her, sexually abused her at red lights when she drove him to and from business events and looked at porn on her work computer. She also says she lost her virginity to the artist after unaccountably blacking out while they were together. Jane Doe told Variety that she said “no” and tried to push Allen away during many sexual interactions, and after she had been allegedly coerced and forced to have sexual intercourse with Allen, she would regularly bleed, cry uncontrollably and run to the bathroom to vomit. Despite these signs, she says Allen failed to acknowledge her physical and emotional pain.  Allen videotaped multiple sexual encounters “to blackmail her to stay silent,” according to the suit, while she says he insisted Jane Doe surrender her own phone and other electronics when they were together.  “I have to tell this story because there’s no way I would let my daughter near a situation like this,” the plaintiff told Variety. “My life has been turned inside out because of Jimmie Allen.”  Allen’s wife, Alexis, has been mostly quiet since they jointly announced their impending divorce. Just prior to the lawsuit being filed, she posted a couple of statements, asking to be left in peace: “Continue the chaos while I heal in peace,” she wrote, and: “My Instagram isn’t a help line so please stop messaging me about any third parties.”  On Thursday, though, screenshots emerged reported to be of a statement Alexis posted and then deleted on her Instagram, in which she seems to be taking aim both at her husband and his accuser, or accusers. It read: “Imagine being a woman who is so f***** up mentally emotionally and pursues a man who is married with 3 children & a pregnant wife. Imagine. I could never.” The statement added, “Y’all can kiss my ass with the ‘estranged wife’ narrative. I really wish I was only talking about one female.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9tdXNpYy9uZXdzL2ppbW1pZS1hbGxlbi1hcG9sb2dpemVzLXdpZmUtYWZmYWlyLXNleHVhbC1hc3NhdWx0LWxhd3N1aXQtMTIzNTYxODE5OC_SAW5odHRwczovL3ZhcmlldHkuY29tLzIwMjMvbXVzaWMvbmV3cy9qaW1taWUtYWxsZW4tYXBvbG9naXplcy13aWZlLWFmZmFpci1zZXh1YWwtYXNzYXVsdC1sYXdzdWl0LTEyMzU2MTgxOTgvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Nikola Jokic had his 13th playoff triple-double with 23 points, 17 rebounds and a dozen assists for the Nuggets, who have never been this close to reaching the NBA Finals in their history.  Game 3 is Saturday night at Crypto.com Arena, where LeBron James and the Lakers are 8-0 in the playoffs.  Jamal's jumpers go down  Murray missed 12 of his 17 shots through three quarters but found his touch in the fourth, going 6 for 7, including four 3-pointers and fueling a 15-1 run that gave Denver a 96-84 lead.  Just like in Game 1, the Lakers didn't go down easily. They pulled to three points on Austin Reaves' jumper before Murray sank two free throws with 12 seconds left and Bruce Brown stole the ball from James, then dribbled out the final 8 seconds.  The Nuggets improved to 41-8 at home, best in the NBA, including 8-0 in the playoffs.  Lakers fade in Mile High  James and Reaves both scored 22 for Los Angeles. Anthony Davis scored 18 after pouring in 40 in the opener and Rui Hachimura scored 21 points off the bench.  For much of the night, it appeared as though the Lakers would wrest home-court advantage from the Nuggets, who are the top seed for the first time in their history. The Lakers won the series openers at Memphis and Golden State to reach the conference championship.  The outstanding defense Hachimura played on Jokic in the fourth quarter of the Lakers' loss in Game 1 led many to believe coach Darvin Ham would start Hachimura to try to stymie the Nuggets' star center from the start. But instead he came off the bench again.  And what a spark he provided, sinking all seven of his first-half shots for a game-high 17 points at the half. His 3-pointer and pull-up jumper sparked a 9-0 run to open the second quarter and put the Lakers in charge despite slow starts from James and Davis, each of whom were held to two points in the first quarter.  James' breakaway dunk made it 68-57 midway through the third quarter, but the Nuggets got back into it with a 10-0 run and took their first lead since the first quarter when Murray's 3 made it 84-83.  His step-back 3 at the 7-minute mark made it 87-83. Another 3 made it 99-87, and he sank seven of eight free throws in the final minute.  Tip-ins  Lakers: Los Angeles made 23 of 26 free throws. ... Davis and James were a combined 13 of 36 from the floor.  Nuggets: The Nuggets were miffed when ESPN sideline reporter Lisa Salters said after Game 1 that she'd never seen Jokic play before. ... Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, who scored 21 in Game 1, picked up his second foul 1:39 into the game and sat the rest of the first quarter. ... The Nuggets outscored the Lakers by 18 points from the arc.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmNhLmNvbS9lbi9iYXNrZXRiYWxsL25iYS8yMDIzLzA1LzE5LzY0NjZkMjZhMjI2MDFkNzg1MThiNDU3Yy5odG1s0gFQaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAubWFyY2EuY29tL2VuL2Jhc2tldGJhbGwvbmJhLzIwMjMvMDUvMTkvNjQ2NmQyNmEyMjYwMWQ3ODUxOGI0NTdjLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The phone of Elias, a septuagenarian resident of Marottichal, exploded in his shirt pocket. The incident happened around 10 o'clock yesterday morning. The blast took place when Elias was sitting in a hotel and drinking tea.  Immediately after noticing the explosion, Elias took his phone out of his pocket and threw it on the floor. However, his shirt caught fire. But he was able to extinguish the sparks and flames immediately. He escaped unhurt. The mobile phone that exploded was bought for one thousand rupees from a shop on Thrissur Post Office Road a year ago. A phone that works with a normal keypad has exploded.  The cell phone blast was captured on CCTV at the hotel where the victim was sipping his tea at the time of the incident. The hotel staffer tried to come to the rescue of Elias upon noticing the explosion in his shirt pocket. He heaved a sigh of relief on seeing that the victim suffered no injuries in the incident. Only a part of his shirt pocket was scorched. Later, the hotel staffer poured water on the burning cell phone on the floor.

"explosion","2023-05-19","Not Discerned","{""Christchurch"", ""Canterbury"", ""NewZealand""}","Fri 19 May 2023 00:00:00","Briscoe Group managing director Rod Duke told investors today that the company is ready for international retailers in NZ. Photo / Dean Purcell  Rod Duke told shareholders the Briscoe Group will have to lift its game in light of international competition from the likes of Costco and Ikea.  The group’s managing director spoke at the retailer’s annual general meeting in Auckland central today where shareholders expressed concerns about international retail competition coming to New Zealand.  Duke said Ikea were “terrific retailers” but would not be direct competition.  “We don’t sell furniture but we’ll be keeping an eye on them.  “They will be a great addition to NZ’s retail scene. We’re going to have to lift our game,” Duke told shareholders.  The home and sportswear retailer posted unaudited first-quarter sales of $181.2 million last week, up 2.8 per cent on the same quarter last year.  Homeware sales were up 2.9 per cent at $109.9m while sportswear sales were at $71.3m up 2.78 per cent.  The company’s share price was down 4c today at $3.96.  In response to competition from Costco, he said its competitors would be the likes of food wholesalers such as Gilmours, especially in major cities.  “I don’t think they’ll be a direct competitor,” Duke told shareholders.  “I don’t see them being a big seller of Nike and Adidas but they will be a competitor, especially in Auckland and Wellington.”  “If you’re in the food business, you’d be really worried,” Duke said.  Costco opened its doors in Westgate, Auckland last September while Ikea has not opened a local store yet.  The Herald previously reported that Ikea planned to open its first NZ store in Mt Wellington, Auckland in December 2024.  He assured shareholders the company does not plan to switch to self-service in stores, when a shareholder told Duke: “Don’t do self-checkouts.”  “I promise you when it comes up, I’ll vote against it,” Duke responded.  Another shareholder’s concern was the lack of outlets in regional locations such as Masterton.  Duke said the company is focused on refurbishing existing stores but increasing demand in smaller areas meant Rebel Sport stores may be on the cards for greater Wellington.  He said decreases in sales across Auckland and Wellington have shown the bite from the cost of living crisis but flexibility across the group’s homewares and sports brands meant sales were likely to stay consistent.  Resilience  Group chair Dame Rosanne Meo said the pandemic has shown the company’s ability to survive adverse economic conditions.  “Our business model and operations were thoroughly stress-tested by the pandemic,” she told shareholders.  She said the group’s results showed the company was robust and resilient.  “We have specialised streams of retailing, not departmental which is struggling globally.”  Meo said homeware and sports goods were not just for “fanatics” but for day-to-day use.  Duke said Ikea are “terrific retailers” but would not be direct competition to Briscoe Group. Photo / NZME  “Explosion in crime”  Chief financial officer Geoff Scowcroft said $3m in goods were stolen every year from its stores, alongside increasingly abusive behaviour towards staff.  He said a tight labour market, increased wages across two consecutive years and an “explosion in crime” had driven up operational costs.  Scowcroft said the retailer suffered seven ram raids and 12 internal store attacks in the last year.  “There is increasing abuse and aggressive behaviour in-store faced by our team,” he told shareholders.  “Our team have to face this behaviour day in and day out.”  The group implemented security measures like licence plate recognition, bollards, silent alarms and high-quality security cameras, Scowcroft said.  He said the company was also eager to implement facial recognition systems to bolster security measures.  Duke said the company was spending an extra $1m a year on security.  He told the Mike Hosking Breakfast Show on Newstalk ZB the current retail crime situation was the worst he’d ever seen.  The year ahead  Scowcroft said: “We aren’t under any illusions at all about how difficult it is” in the retail space.  Supply chain general manager Darren Porteous said the company was setting up two major distribution centres in the North and South Islands.  Briscoe intended to use these for direct shipment from suppliers and to manage online sales.  A sustainability strategy planned for the next year will also include solar power and rain catchments in a move to assure customers.  Duke’s response was less than enthusiastic: “I’m not looking forward to paying for it”.  Chief operations officer Andrew Scott said consumers wanted NZ businesses to stock sustainable products and now chose to shop with retailers “on the basis of doing the right thing”.  The company planned to release its first climate change disclosure report and monitor supply chain ethics.  Duke said he expected NZ retail to be sensitive to deteriorating economic conditions and “political uncertainty” ahead of this year’s election.  “We don’t underestimate the difficulty of the trading environment. It will be difficult to replicate our record sales,” he told shareholders.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uemhlcmFsZC5jby5uei9idXNpbmVzcy9icmlzY29lLWJvc3Mtcm9kLWR1a2UtcHJlcGFyZXMtdG8tbGlmdC1nYW1lLXRvLWNvbXBldGUtd2l0aC1jb3N0Y28tYW5kLWlrZWEvUjNGQVNKQVhEQkg3N0VRNktKUVRJWEhWVEkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"explosion","1945-08-06","Not Discerned","{""Hiroshima"", ""Hiroshima"", ""Japan""}","Fri 19 May 2023 06:47:37","As the G7 summit takes place in Japan, survivors of the 1945 atomic bomb caution leaders about the human cost of nuclear weapons.  Hiroshima, Japan – “It looked like a bright orange light, like the first sunrise of the year,” says Sadae Kasaoka, remembering the moment when the first nuclear bomb to ever be used was dropped by the United States on the Japanese city of Hiroshima.  Now 90, she was 12 years old that August day at the tail end of World War II, but she still remembers it vividly.  Sadae was home alone with her grandmother. When the blast hit, she was pushed against the wall by the massive force of the explosion and covered in broken glass. The two then fled into an air raid shelter for safety.  Sadae pauses, her voice trembling as she goes on to recall the events of August 6, 1945. “A neighbour told us the whole city was on fire,” she says.  For hours she did not know whether her parents had survived. When her brother brought her father’s body home, he was alive, but so severely burned that she could not recognise him.  “He was all black. His eyes were popping out. Finally, I recognised him by his voice. He said ‘Give me water’. And he asked me to go looking for my mother,” Sadae says, taking a breath. “Someone told me you shouldn’t give them water, so I did not give him any water, but that is something I still regret deeply.”  Sadae’s father died two days later. The following day she found out her mother was killed and already cremated along with many other victims.  The exact number of deaths from the uranium bomb remains unclear to this day, with a large gap between the lowest and highest estimates. The City of Hiroshima reports that by the end of 1945 up to approximately 140,000 people – out of a population of 350,000 – had died either in the explosion itself or from the effects of acute radiation poisoning. Most were civilians.  Days later, on August 9, a larger plutonium bomb was then dropped on Nagasaki – some 400km (248 miles) away from Hiroshima. According to the Nobel Peace Prize-winning International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN), around another 74,000 people lost their lives there by December 1945. Many of those who survived suffered from long-term illnesses.  The first and last atomic bombs ever dropped on a civilian population, the Hiroshima and Nagasaki attacks are often seen as a uniquely horrible moment in human history. But with countries building up weapons capabilities and threats of nuclear options in Russia’s war against Ukraine, many fear that humanity is not doing enough to avoid repeating itself. With the Group of Seven (G7) summit taking place in Hiroshima this week, some survivors see it as an opportunity to remind world leaders what the real costs are.  ‘All my friends died’  Toshiko Tanaka grew up in Hiroshima. When the explosion hit, the then-six-year-old suffered burns as well as exposure to radiation, but miraculously survived.  Today the 84-year-old uses a stick to help herself walk, but otherwise seems to be in good health. However, the traumatic memories of that fateful day will forever be imprinted in her mind.  It was a school day, Toshiko remembers. On their way to class, she and a friend noticed a plane overhead. When someone yelled “enemy”, Toshiko looked up to the sky. Then she saw the light.  “I instinctively covered my face,” she says, recalling that she used her right arm to protect herself. That night she developed a high fever. “I don’t remember much. I lost consciousness.”  One of her most vivid memories from that time was the smell of burning corpses in the days after the explosion. The authorities had started cremating the bodies of those who died.  “I was traumatised,” she says. “All my friends from school died and for a very long time I couldn’t speak about what happened.”  When she was 70, Toshiko went on a boat trip organised by the Japanese non-profit Peaceboat, an initiative inviting survivors of the atomic bomb on a journey around the world telling their stories. That is when she realised she had to speak up and finally share her testimony, she says.  Today she wants everyone to know how dangerous nuclear weapons are to mankind and the unimaginable suffering they cause. “I want our leaders to see what happened in Hiroshima and imagine what would happen to your family, to your friends, if a bomb was dropped on them.”  Toshiko started travelling to the US and learned a little English to tell her story; she’s made 10 such trips in the past seven years.  She speaks as a “hibakusha” – a Japanese term for those affected by the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. At the last count in 2021, an estimated 42,000 hibakushas were still living in Hiroshima, according to the Japanese Ministry of Health. The average age then was 84. Soon what happened in Hiroshima will pass beyond living memory.  ‘Credible, actionable plan’ for disarmament  In 2016, Barack Obama became the first sitting US president to meet with survivors at Hiroshima’s Peace Memorial Park during a historic trip. This year, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has invited his fellow G7 leaders to his family’s native city – a summit that includes another visit to the park, where the Atomic Bomb Dome, the only structure left standing in the area after 1945, remains.  US President Joe Biden, along with leaders from France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada and Italy, will join to commemorate those who lost their lives in 1945. Although the attacks remain the only use of nuclear weapons in history, three of these visiting G7 countries have their own, while others host them on their territory.  Daniel Högsta, the interim executive director of ICAN, wants to see leaders of the G7 commit to a “credible, actionable plan” on nuclear disarmament, one that involves a treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons. “Anything less than that would be insulting to the hibakusha,” he tells Al Jazeera. “It would also be a failure of leadership.”  For Toshiko, the visit could not be more crucial at a time when some say the world is closer to a nuclear war than it has been in decades.  “I want them to really pay attention to what happens when you use a nuclear weapon,” she says. “There is a war in Ukraine now and this summit should not be a place where you make military preparations.” She wants this meeting to be about finding a way back to peace.  While walking through the Peace Memorial Park, Toshiko shares that as a child she used to swim in the Motoyasu River between the park and the iconic Atomic Bomb Dome, which used to be part of Hiroshima Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall – an exhibition space.  But she doesn’t like coming to the area anymore. It reminds her that it was once a bustling city centre of Hiroshima. “Then all of a sudden it was gone,” she says, explaining the unease she feels being there now.  However, she thinks it is important for the world to know what happened in this place. So does her fellow hibakusha Sadae, who now gives talks at the nearby Peace Memorial Museum. “Nuclear weapons should not exist, they should not be built and that’s why we are raising our voice,” she answers when asked about her message to the world leaders coming to her city.  August 6, 1945 did not just change the city of Hiroshima and affect the lives of hundreds of thousands of survivors. It also changed the world.  World War II ended with Japan’s formal surrender on September 2 that year, nearly 80 years ago. Yet the horrors of what happened and the dangers of nuclear war feel ever more present – especially to those who remember first-hand one of the darkest days in history.

The full text of the letter can be found here and below.  Dear Secretary Austin and General Milley:  On March 8, 2023, the House Foreign Affairs Committee (HFAC) held a hearing examining the catastrophic withdrawal from Afghanistan. During the hearing, HFAC heard testimony from witnesses on the scene of the August 26, 2021, terrorist attack at Abbey Gate, which killed 13 American servicemembers and wounded another 45, also killing approximately 170 Afghan civilians. Testimony during the hearing raises serious questions regarding the events leading up to the attack, which must be answered.  Marine Sergeant Tyler Vargas-Andrews, a sniper badly wounded in the explosion, testified that his sniper team believed they identified the suicide bomber responsible for the attack earlier in the day. According to his testimony, Sergeant Vargas-Andrews and his team did not eliminate the threat due to their leadership’s uncertainty as to who held the authority to approve or deny engagement.  Battlefield decisions are often made in a cloud, but in honor of the lives lost and those still living following that terrible day, it is incumbent we learn whether events were avoidable and if uncertain procedures, broken lines of communication, or worse, contributed to the lack of engagement.  To provide Congress a better understanding of these events, we request the following no later than June 2, 2023:  A detailed description of the response to the request for engagement authority by Sergeant Vargas-Andrews’ sniper team, including fully detailing each step in its consideration, the request’s outcome, and the reason for any decisions; All documents and communications referencing or relating to the events at Abbey Gate on August 26, 2021, including but not limited to: All documents and communications referencing or relating to the request by Sergeant Vargas-Andrews’ sniper team for engagement authority, or any other such request by other servicemembers; All documents, communications, or intelligence products referencing or relating to the identity of the perpetrator(s) and planner(s) of the Abbey Gate attack; All documents and communications referencing or relating to the Rules of Engagement in effect at the time of the Abbey Gate attack; All video, audio, and/or photographs of the events at and around Abbey Gate on August 26, 2021, including, but not limited to, those from U.S. government equipment (raid cameras, drones, phones, etc.) as well as personal devices of servicemembers and eyewitnesses (phones, cameras, GoPros, etc); and, All messaging and/or chat room logs in the possession of the Department of Defense (text messages, ChatSurfer logs, etc.) relating to engaging with threats in the vicinity of Hamid Karzai International Airport (“HKIA”) between August 1st and September 31st, 2021; and, Concerning the “Department of Defense Afghanistan After Action Review: January 2020–August 2021” (AAR) and the November 8, 2022, Memorandum for the Record from Secretary Austin (MFR) Footnotes in the AAR, all of which were omitted from the copies of the AAR received by the Committee on Armed Services; and, Transcripts of all interviews conducted during and in furtherance of production of the AAR.

It's the tallest and fastest in Canada boasting an initial drop of 80 degrees while reaching speeds of 148 km/h. (Randy Risling/Toronto Star via Getty Images) (Randy Risling via Getty Images)  You may want to think twice about choosing the front seat of a roller coaster after a collision between Canada's Wonderland Leviathon roller coaster and a bird left thrill seekers covered in blood and feathers on Tuesday.  Toronto man Hubert Hsu thought he was making a bold choice by choosing the front row — something he typically wouldn't do, Hsu told media.  As the coaster climbed its way to the peak of one of the ride's many loops, Hsu says what appeared to be a pigeon made direct contact with the front of the car he was in.  RELATED: York Police relaunch Operation Beehave after mayhem at Canada's Wonderland  “I looked down and saw blood and my hands and my face. There was a feather on my hand, and feathers on the girl next to me’s shirt. It seemed like the coaster car hit the bird and then it sort of exploded on us,"" Hsu said to media.  Left in a state of shock and confusion over what had just occurred, Hsu said that Wonderland staff did not take any action until other riders on the coaster flagged down ride operators.  The riders were then safely able to dismount the ride once the coaster came to a stop.  “I asked for wipes, and they gave us those brown, disposable paper towel rolls like you see in industrial schools,” Hsu said to media.  RELATED: Rollercoaster riders stranded on ride at Canada's Wonderland  A representative for Canada's Wonderland confirmed the incident, saying a guest had reported an incident involving a bird.  A statement released by the theme park states that first aid was offered to the rider, and no injuries were reported among the guests.

Attendees heard that the AI Act would have a significant impact on businesses, and would bring with it a whole new layer of regulatory obligations with which general counsel must contend.  Forthcoming AI regulations – including the EU AI Act and the EU Liability Directives – and their interplay with existing laws, such as the GDPR, were also discussed.  The masterclass (17 May) was hosted by technology partner David Kirton and focused on the central role in-house lawyers will play in their organisations' implementation of AI technologies.  William Fry has hosted a masterclass on artificial intelligence (AI) law for in-house counsel at its Dublin office.  Rachel Hayes pointed out that, while AI was a novel technology, it essentially processed data, and the underlying rules remained unchanged.  Robust data governance  Therefore, it was crucial to establish robust data governance, ensuring safe implementation of this technology, and compliance with forthcoming legislation when enacted.  David Cullen tackled liability issues that might arise from the use of AI, and the importance of reviewing contracts with an eye to IP and liability considerations.  ""As AI technology evolves, so too must our understanding and application of the law,” said David Kirton.  Barry Scannell added that the ‘explosion in AI tech’ had been triggered by an ‘explosion in big data’.  “AI is trained on data, and its growth is due to the massive amounts of data now available for it to feed on.  “By 2025, we will be producing as much data every three minutes as all of human civilisation did up to the year 2003,” he added.

(Dakota News Now) - The explosion of pickleball across the country hasn’t slowed down in recent years. If anything, it’s only growing faster.  Nationwide, there’s over 36 million pickleball players, according to Pickleheads. While South Dakota is catching up on the explosion in popularity, the state is seeing it’s own rise in the sport.  “Pickleball is well on its way to being one of the largest sports in the country by participation, which we couldn’t be more happy about,” Pickleheads co-founder Brandon Mackie said.  Active Generations Fitness Manager Jenny Centra said they’re hosting open courts multiple times a week, with a growing number of players out each time.  “We have new people coming in on the daily, at least five to six people new every day,” Centra said.  Centra said it’s still growing in popularity because it’s easy to pick up, and something that every age group can do.  “You have all sorts of fitness levels that come out here too. People that have never played tennis or never heard of pickleball that will come out because somebody said, ‘Oh, you’ve got to try it at Active Generations, you can get lessons,’” Centra said.  While the number of permanent courts in South Dakota is well below other states, the sport is growing. Mackie said there’s around 50 permanent courts across the state, and they’re looking to help host competitions and tournaments in the area with their website as a platform.  “To build some free tools for pickleball organizers. To mange their groups, to put on tournaments, to do fun events. We’re trying to do a few in cities all over the U.S. this summer, and Sioux Falls is definitely high on the list. We think there’s a great pickleball scene, Sioux Falls Area Pickleball club. There’s some good organizations and great facilities,” Mackie said.  Mackie said soon enough, competitive pickleball could be commonplace, and South Dakota could be a part of that movement.  “The sport of pickleball is becoming more and more competitive, there’s a lot of great players out there.

The limited series, Shiny Happy People: Duggar Family Secrets, aims to go beneath the surface as it explores the wholesome family's troubling ties to a radical religious organization, the Institute in Basic Life Principles. In doing so, it unveils how the organization has shaped — and negatively impacted — the once-beloved TLC brood, which has since experienced a series of controversial scandals.  In PEOPLE's exclusive look at the first trailer, a man claims: ""World domination was the goal.""  ""The IBLP teachings aren't Christianity,"" a woman then alleges. ""They're something entirely different.""  The trailer eventually teases Jill (Duggar) Dillard, Derick Dillard and Amy (Duggar) King's involvement.  ""There's a story that's going to be told,"" Jill, 32, says. ""And I would rather be the one telling it.""  Prime Video  Thinking back to her upbringing, Jill adds of her family: ""We were part of IBLP as early as I can remember.""  More accusations fly throughout the trailer, as one man alleges that IBLP founder Bill Gothard ""turned every father into a cult leader and every home into an island.""

"explosion","2020-05-17","Not Discerned","{""Stockholm"", ""Stockholm"", ""Sweden""}","Thu 18 May 2023 22:40:00","Newswise — Astronomers have, for the initial instance, witnessed radio waves released by a Type Ia supernova, an explosion deriving from a white dwarf star, offering vital insights into comprehending white dwarf explosions.  A Type Ia (One-A) supernova denotes the nuclear burst of a white dwarf star. This supernova category enjoys widespread recognition; astronomers employ these supernovae to gauge cosmological distances and the Universe's expansion. Nevertheless, the explosion mechanism behind Type Ia supernovae remains poorly understood. Unaccompanied white dwarfs do not undergo explosions, suggesting that mass accumulation from a neighboring companion star contributes to triggering the outburst. The amassed mass typically consists of the companion star's outer layer, predominantly composed of hydrogen. However, it has been contemplated that a white dwarf could also accumulate helium from a companion star that shed its hydrogen-rich outer layer.  While the white dwarf siphons matter from its companion star, not all of the substance converges onto the white dwarf. Instead, a portion of it coalesces into a cluster of circumstellar material encircling the binary star system. Anticipated are shockwaves generated by the detonation of a white dwarf within this circumstellar material, which would stimulate atoms and induce the emission of potent radio waves. Despite numerous instances of Type Ia supernovae erupting within such circumstellar clouds, astronomers had hitherto not witnessed any accompanying radio wave emissions associated with this specific type of supernova.  A multinational team of researchers, including scientists from Stockholm University and the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, meticulously observed a Type Ia supernova that erupted in 2020. Their findings unveiled that this particular supernova was enveloped by circumstellar material predominantly composed of helium. Additionally, they successfully detected radio waves emanating from the supernova. By comparing the strength of the observed radio waves with theoretical models, they deduced that the progenitor white dwarf star had been accumulating material at a rate equivalent to about 1/1000th of the Sun's mass per year. Remarkably, this discovery marks the first verified instance of a Type Ia supernova ignited by mass accretion from a companion star characterized by an outer layer primarily comprised of helium.  The detection of radio waves originating from a helium-rich Type Ia supernova holds the promise of enhancing our comprehension of the explosion mechanism and the pre-supernova conditions associated with this type of event. Building upon this significant breakthrough, the team intends to conduct further investigations to explore the presence of radio emissions in other instances of Type Ia supernovae. This ambitious endeavor aims to shed light on the evolutionary processes that culminate in these explosive events, further advancing our understanding of their underlying dynamics.  These results appeared as Kool et al. “A radio-detected Type Ia supernova with helium-rich circumstellar material” in the journal Nature on May 17, 2023.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3aXNlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy90eXBlLWlhLXN1cGVybm92YS1maXJzdC1yYWRpby13YXZlLWRldGVjdGlvbtIBTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3aXNlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy90eXBlLWlhLXN1cGVybm92YS1maXJzdC1yYWRpby13YXZlLWRldGVjdGlvbg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"explosion","2023-10-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 10:55:38","A courtroom battle has erupted over the estate of one of the victims of the Creeslough tragedy.  Farmer Hugh Kelly (59) was one of 10 people who when an explosion ripped through a petrol station in the Co Donegal village on October 7th.  Now a row has erupted between a nephew of Mr Kelly and his partner over the deceased’s home and other lands at Bishop’s Island, Castledoe, Creeslough.  Documents read out at Letterkenny Circuit Court heard the late Mr Kelly’s partner, Linda Gallagher, said she is the beneficiary of the last will and testament, dated November 30th, 2006.  Ms Gallagher is seeking an interlocutory injunction against a Mr Kelly’s nephew, Josie Kelly, who she claims is illegally occupying the property.  Judge John Aylmer heard Ms Gallagher attended the property on October 15th, 2022, just a week after her partner had been killed, and discovered Josie Kelly had “wrongfully or illegally entered the dwelling and changed the locks”.  A locksmith was called and a voice was heard inside the property, which Ms Gallagher recognised as Josie Kelly, but the locksmith could not gain entry.  The details were outlined by Ms Gallagher’s barrister, Gareth McGrory, instructed by solicitor Frank Dorrian, who alleged Josie Kelly had unlawfully and wrongfully trespassed and accessed the dwelling.  It was also alleged that he also placed padlocks on the gates and put a donkey on the land while Ms Gallagher had been in America towards the end of October.  The property was registered in the name of Hugh Kelly, who had lived in the house all his life. The property had been passed to him by his late mother, Sally Kelly.  Injunction  Ms Gallagher sought an injunction to restrain the defendant, or agents acting on his behalf, from trespassing, entering or making use of the lands without the expressed authority of the plaintiff.  Mr McGrory said his client was also seeking an injunction to have the defendant repair any damage caused following the alleged illegal trespass.  Mr McGrory explained Ms Gallagher, who was originally from Indiana in the US, had been in a relationship with the deceased. They both maintained separate houses, but there were several pictures of Ms Gallagher in Mr Hugh Kelly’s home.  The court heard Ms Gallagher had been left “distraught” at Mr Kelly’s sudden death and the deaths of the nine other people in the explosion, as well as suffering “shock, pain and sorrow” following the incident.  Josie Kelly was represented in court by barrister, John McCoy.  Mr Kelly said his late grandfather had wished the property to stay in the Kelly family, claiming he had invested over €100,000 on improvements to the property. He said he had also organised crops of hay and silage on the farmland.  He said he had lived at the property since 1984, save for the years of his marriage, until 2018 when he returned to live on the property.  Mr Kelly claimed none of the plaintiff’s possessions are in the house and that he always had a key and access to the house. “The property is my home,” he added.  Judge John Aylmer asked why Mr Kelly had not exhibited anything in support of his evidence.  “The absence is striking,” the judge said, noting he expected to see evidence that Mr Kelly has been living at the property since 2018 and of the €100,000 he said he had spent.  Mr McCoy said he would take the matter back to his client for further instruction and said there were “parallel proceedings” before the High Court.  Judge Aylmer said he was giving a short opportunity for the defendant to put evidence before the court “that one would expect to support a contention that he has been living there since 2019”.  The matter was adjourned to a future court sitting.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd2VzdGVybnBlb3BsZS5pZS8yMDIzLzA1LzE4L2NvdXJ0LWJhdHRsZS1lcnVwdHMtb3Zlci1lc3RhdGUtb2YtY3JlZXNsb3VnaC1leHBsb3Npb24tdmljdGltL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"explosion","2023-05-14","13:00:00","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 20:35:51","White arrows show the first four appearances of supernova Refsdal, which ""reappeared"" a total of five times in different locations around the same galaxy cluster.  One stellar explosion can't get enough of the spotlight. After showing up five times in images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, the bizarre ""reappearing supernova"" is now helping scientists solve one of astronomy's biggest mysteries: how fast the universe is expanding.  About 13.8 billion years ago, the universe as we know it was just a tiny point in space, containing all the matter in existence. Then, an explosion occurred: the Big Bang . That matter rushed outward — and continues to do so today, gaining speed all the time.  Scientists have known about the universe's expansion for nearly a century. But how fast it's expanding is more of a mystery. Two methods used to measure this rate, dubbed the Hubble constant, disagree. One of those methods relies on ""standard candles"" — using bright objects of known distance to calculate how fast stars and galaxies are rushing away from us. Supernovas, exploding stars that produce copious and steady light, are one of these important benchmarks of distance. The other method uses the ""cosmic microwave background,"" leftover radiation from the Big Bang. The problem is that these two methods produce different answers.  There are myriad explanations for the differing values. Scientists might have failed to take into account repulsive dark energy , a mysterious phenomenon that is seemingly causing the universe to expand at an ever-faster rate. The universe might contain particles we haven't yet identified. Or one of the current calculations might just be wrong.  ""It's a conundrum,"" Patrick Kelly (opens in new tab), an assistant professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Minnesota and lead author of a new study on the Hubble constant, told Live Science.  Enter supernova Refsdal. Kelly first discovered this exploding star in 2014, when it popped up four times, in different positions, around the same galaxy cluster. The supernova appeared in multiple locations because the cluster's extreme gravity bent and reflected the supernova's light, creating what is called a gravitational lens . Based on Refsdal's whack-a-mole act, astronomers predicted that the supernova would also reappear in 2015. Their prediction came true (opens in new tab).  In their new research, Kelly and his colleagues triangulated measurements of the supernova's location to calculate a new value for the Hubble constant. The results, published May 11 in the journal Science (opens in new tab), find a value for the Hubble constant that is much closer to the one derived from the cosmic microwave background, rather than the standard-candle method. According to the new study, the universe is expanding at a rate of about 41.4 miles per second (66.6 kilometers per second) per megaparsec (or for every 3.2 million light-years ).  But the findings don't put an end to the debate; they are just one more method, among many, for studying the expanding universe. ""They don't rule out the [standard candle] supernova value,"" Kelly said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlc2NpZW5jZS5jb20vc3BhY2UvY29zbW9sb2d5L3NjaWVudGlzdHMtd2F0Y2hlZC1hLXJlYXBwZWFyaW5nLXN1cGVybm92YS1leHBsb2RlLTUtdGltZXMtaW4tYS1yb3ctYW5kLWl0LWNvdWxkLWhlbHAtcmV2ZWFsLWhvdy1mYXN0LXRoZS11bml2ZXJzZS1pcy1leHBhbmRpbmfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Lance Gooden, R-Texas, plans to introduce the ""Protecting Federal Funds from Human Trafficking and Smuggling Act of 2023"" to set standards for nonprofit organizations as they gather in border towns to assist with the migrant surge.  ""By ensuring that federal funds are not awarded to organizations that engage in these heinous activities, we can safeguard taxpayer dollars and hold bad actors accountable,"" Gooden told Fox News Digital.  Gooden's bill proposes that NGOs certify federal law compliance with the Office of Management and Budget.  JUDICIARY REPUBLICANS INVESTIGATING DHS FUNDING TO NGOS PROVIDING FREE SERVICES FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS  The House Judiciary Committee member also called on Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to produce a strategy to help NGOs with ""deterring, detecting, reporting and removing aliens.""  The bill comes on the heels of an investigation launched by House Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, Tuesday into DHS-funded NGOs that ""receive hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars through federal grants to provide free food, lodging, and transportation for illegal aliens to be released anywhere they want in the United States.""  Asylum-seekers are arriving primarily from Guatemala, Cuba and Venezuela by the thousands since the end of the Title 42 rapid expulsion policy on May 11. As a result, nonprofit organizations are stepping up to transport, shelter and feed migrants in border towns.  Health and Human Services (HHS) whistleblower Tara Lee Rodas testified during a House hearing in April that migrant children in particular were victims of a ""sophisticated network"" of labor trafficking. The government places unaccompanied minors with sponsors throughout the U.S., some of whom ""view children as commodities and assets to be used for earning income – this is why we are witnessing an explosion of labor trafficking,"" Rodas said.  If enacted, Gooden's bill would apply to nonprofit groups that have been awarded federal funding or an ""agreement, contract, award, or relationship with the Federal Government.""  The bill’s introduction follows a Heritage Foundation report that found many NGOs ""apply for, and receive, taxpayer money to provide processing and transportation services and infrastructure to facilitate the migration of illegal aliens into the interior of the country.""  The Heritage Foundation tracked more than 30,000 mobile devices from NGO facilities to 431 separate U.S. congressional districts across the country during January 2022.  MIGRANT NUMBERS AT SOUTHERN BORDER EXCEEDED 200,000 IN APRIL, PRIOR TO TITLE 42’S EXPIRATION  Gooden’s office said that while the Judiciary and Oversight committees are collecting evidence, ""We know through whistleblowers and migrants themselves that this funding is going toward federal handouts including lodging, transportation, debit cards, and free legal advice.""  The congressman also sent letters to Catholic Charities, Jewish Family Services and the Lutheran Immigration Services, requesting full amounts of federal funds. However, no response was given.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Customs and Border Protection sources tell Fox News that migrant encounters are dropping since the expiration of the Title 42 policy, with less than 4,000 illegal border crossings on Monday.

For more, read our series overview , which lays out the scale of the problem, explores the humanitarian fallout, and points to some large gaps in the aid sector response.  PANAMÁ, Honduras  Hipólito Rivas was aware that his battles to protect the land could end up getting him killed.  Over the course of the decade he spent running the agricultural cooperative he founded, he had lost numerous friends to shadowy paramilitaries reportedly connected to land-grabbing palm oil corporations in the rural Honduran region where he farmed.  In January 2023, the threats against the 46-year-old farmer intensified: his name appeared on a hitlist, there were intimidating phone calls, men with AK-47s fired rounds off over his house at night. But he refused to stop his struggle, or to leave his community.  Then, on 12 February, gunmen shooting from a car executed Rivas and his son while they were riding a motorbike on the edge of their palm plantation.  “Now that they’ve killed my dad and brother, they’re threatening even more people,” Ibeth Rivas, Hipólito Rivas’ daughter, told The New Humanitarian outside their home in Panamá. “They’re going to kill more people.”  “It was very sad,” said a resident from a neighbouring town who attended the funeral and asked to remain anonymous. “There was a lot of grief in the family, the community, the farm workers organisation. They felt indignation, impotence, and completely defenceless before an armed group that had them surrounded.”  Rivas and his son were murdered in the Aguán Valley, in the coastal and agricultural department of Colón in northern Honduras. According to Insight Crime, the country had the highest homicide rate last year in Central America and the second highest in all of Latin America – second only to Venezuela.  “People are affected by a triple emergency – violence from drug corridors, droughts and the storms, and the pandemic.”  Since a military coup ousted president Manuel “Mel” Zelaya in 2009, Honduras has weathered several waves of violence linked to corruption, battles over land and resources, and drug trafficking. In 2013, the Honduran city of San Pedro Sula earned the unenviable rating of the world’s most violent place outside a declared war zone.  In the past year, the violence has escalated and expanded to new areas of the country, displacing more people and putting additional duress on an already strained humanitarian response.  “People are affected by a triple emergency – violence from drug corridors, droughts and the storms, and the pandemic,” said Maria José Alexander, emergency coordinator at the Catholic Relief Services aid agency. “We have to choose among the vulnerable, to choose the most vulnerable [to help].”  More and more Hondurans are heading north, hoping to reach safety in the United States. But those who flee – the Rivas family plans to join them – are often stranded on the US southern border, facing humanitarian challenges as President Joe Biden’s administration implements new policies to limit asylum claims.  Read more: How the US-Mexico border became an unrelenting humanitarian crisis  According to the UN’s refugee agency, UNHCR, an “unprecedented flow” of people transited through Honduras and left the country heading north in 2022. Hondurans represented the largest nationality requesting asylum in Mexico in 2022, and from January to September of last year more than 72,000 were deported from the United States and Mexico, according to Human Rights Watch.  Violence going rural  The violence in Honduras has historically been concentrated in urban areas, where gangs assert control, but these days an increasing number of killings are taking place in the countryside.  Colón has long been known for its conflicts over control of land and water between a drug-connected elite and local campesinos, or farm workers. According to statistics from the National Police Secretariat (SEPOL), it had the highest homicide rate in the country for 2022, with nearly 63 murders per 100,000 people, and at least 224 murders by the end of the year, versus 159 in 2020.  The murders have been attributed to expanding criminal networks, rising extortion rackets, and executions of suspected criminals at the hands of self-styled death squads.  Jared Olson/TNH Family members prepare a grave for the leader of a Colón cooperative opposing the seizing of palm plantations by agribusinesses. Omar Cruz, killed in January 2023 by unknown gunmen, is one of eight social leaders murdered since the end of last year.  Residents in Panamá, the small town four miles from Tocoa, Colón’s main urban centre, where the Rivas family lived, told The New Humanitarian the police are not investigating the murders of Rivas and his son.  This is not unusual, experts say. Honduran police are accused of manipulating the forms in which homicides are registered to create a false sense of security, as well as of failing to investigate the vast majority of murders, a 2020 article published in the NACLA Report on The Americas reported. A 2022 survey noted that seven out of ten Hondurans distrust the police.  Neither the public prosecutor’s office in the capital, Tegucigalpa, nor the local Tocoa police authorities responded to The New Humanitarian’s requests for comment.  ‘Surrounded by violence’  Experts attribute the recent carnage partly to the reshuffling of criminal networks in the wake of the July 2022 extradition of former president Juan Orlando Hernández to the United States on charges of drug and weapons trafficking, and since the election of ostensibly left-leaning president Xiomara Castro, who took office in January 2022.  “We know that the organised criminal structures that existed prior to January [2022] didn't just disappear,” said George Redmond, the Honduras director of the Irish aid organisation Trócaire,  “There has to be a new restructuring of relationships between the authorities and organised criminal groups like drug traffickers,” Redmond, who visited Colón last April, told The New Humanitarian.  A longtime resident of Colón and land rights activist, who spoke to The New Humanitarian anonymously, said there are now six paramilitary groups fighting for control and carrying out targeted killings in a region of the Aguán Valley known as the Margen Izquierda (Left Bank).  By late March, the frequent shootouts in the region had led to temporary closures of schools in Rigores, a town in Margen Izquierda. Across the country, children are increasingly deprived of proper schooling. According to the UN, 46% of displaced students suspended their education or couldn't return to class because of gang violence.  “You’ve got armed groups doing the rounds,” said Redmond, adding that groups like the one terrorising Panamá divide communities, buying off young men with the allure of drugs and guns, and sowing paranoia and distrust through killings and intimidation.  “You’re surrounded by violence from within and from without,” he said.  Abandoned by the government  Since the murder of Rivas and his son, their relatives have received no support from the government or outside organisations. They are now planning to leave – part of an ongoing crisis of internal displacement, triggered by multiple factors, including the rising violence, natural disasters, and economic stagnation. Authorities are at a loss for how to respond.  “While [Honduran authorities have] acknowledged that the country has a problem with internal displacement due to violence, neither the government nor the international NGOs who are present in the country are able to offer any real solutions to the internally displaced,” said Dr. Amelia Frank-Vitale, a postdoctoral research associate at Princeton University who has specialised on Honduras and migration.  Some 3.2 million people in Honduras are in need of assistance, many of them requiring protection and food, but only about 44% of the humanitarian needs in 2022 received funding.  “Families that NRC is assisting with relocation, support, and protection in Honduras told me how armed gangs used violence to take their land and property, and threatened to recruit their children. This forced them to flee their homes and ended their livelihoods and their children’s education,” Jan Egeland, the head of the Norwegian Refugee Council aid group, said in a statement after a visit last month.  “Women had survived horrific violence at home, including rape and other sexual violence. A woman was murdered every 28 hours last year in Honduras,” Egeland added. “Without increased attention and support for this crisis, nothing will change.”  In December, the “Law of Prevention, Attention to, and Protection of Internally Displaced People” was passed in the Honduran Congress, creating a legal framework for attending to internally displaced people. Implementation of the law is uncertain, and the Castro administration is facing other challenges.  “Neither the government nor the international NGOs who are present in the country are able to offer any real solutions to the internally displaced.”  After her election, Castro promised a “refounding” for the country. She said she would demilitarise the country’s security forces, which are linked to drug traffickers and gangs, including MS-13, one of the most dangerous in Central America.  But after a series of massacres last year, she agreed to keep the military police on the streets. She recently announced she would deploy other militarised police units to fight criminal groups and drug traffickers. Although her so-called “mano dura” (iron fist) crime policy remains popular, many Hondurans have grown frustrated over the lack of results.  “I think we were mistaken,” said Medarda Rivas, Hipólito’s sister. “I thought… [the Castro government] would help us as campesinos, but there isn’t a single thing they’ve done for us.”  Many residents in rural places like the Aguán Valley say they feel abandoned.  The Honduran government is supposed to protect people facing death threats through the National Protection Mechanism, which allows a person facing repeated deaths to call for police protection. But that programme failed Rivas, said Esmilda Rodas, one of his friends, and the widow of Juan Manual Moncada, another campesino who was murdered in Panamá in 2021.  “[My husband] would always call the police, to say ‘this is happening, you should be here,’” said Rodas. “They never came; the only times they did, they’d leave soon. They never protected them.”  Edited by Daniela Mohor and Tom Brady.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW5ld2h1bWFuaXRhcmlhbi5vcmcvbmV3cy1mZWF0dXJlLzIwMjMvMDUvMTgvdmlvbGVuY2UtSG9uZHVyYXMtZ2FuZ3MtaHVtYW5pdGFyaWFuLXJlc3BvbnNl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The alerts extended to all regions of the country for about an hour from 2 a.m. (2300 GMT).  But there were no reports of strikes on infrastructure or civilian targets and no indications of casualties as the alerts were withdrawn in Kyiv and in central and southern regions.  Air raid alerts remained in force into the early morning throughout western Ukraine, but only in two regions in the east and Russian-annexed Crimea in the south.  The head of Kyiv's military administration said Russian forces had sent successive waves of drones towards the capital, the 10th attack this month and the second in less than 24 hours.  ""This Kremlin tactic is an attempt to overwhelm our anti-aircraft forces and put psychological pressure on civilians. It won't happen!"" Serhiy Popko wrote on Telegram.  ""All air targets sent toward Kyiv were destroyed by our anti-aircraft defences.""  Several regions reported anti-aircraft units in operation.  Explosions were reported in widely separated regions, including Kriviy Rih in central Ukraine and Rivne and Lutsk in the west.  Ukraine's military had said on Telegram that Russian aircraft were in the air and there was a threat of strikes from hypersonic Kinzhal missiles. An earlier military statement said some airborne targets had been downed, but gave no details.  The military had warned that central regions and Kyiv were at risk from drones.

"explosion","2023-05-19","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 00:25:24","Exploding cars may be entertaining to watch in action films. But cars erupting into fireballs when they crash or tumble down a mountainside is one of the most common and scientifically preposterous movie tropes.  With the release of Fast X, the latest in the Fast & Furious franchise, on May 19 2023, it’s time to debunk the myth of the exploding car.  Cars never explode under these circumstances and rarely catch fire. That’s unless you were unfortunate enough to be driving a Ford Pinto or Chevrolet Malibu in the 1970s. Both manufacturers cut corners in the production process and the result was poorly designed fuel tanks that were vulnerable to catching alight, often trapping the occupants inside.  Even when racing driver Romain Grosjean crashed at 140mph at the 2020 Bahrain Grand Prix, his vehicle caught fire but did not explode.  Petrol vapour is only explosive in air (which is 20% oxygen) and when under pressure. Liquid petrol isn’t explosive but the vapour can catch fire. Vapour can escape from the fuel tank when you unscrew the cap. But tanks have a system in which the pressure is relieved without venting the vapour. A full fuel tank is safer than you might think since there is no air inside it and so no oxygen.  In fact, liquid petrol can be difficult to ignite even when it comes into contact with a flame.  What an explosion needs  Explosions are normally caused by a reaction where one or more solids or liquids react and produce a corresponding amount of gas.  A gas occupies much more space (800 times the volume of liquid or solid) than the equivalent amount of solid or liquid. The force generated by the rapidly expanding gas creates the explosion.  Shrapnel is added to explosive weapons of war, which is propelled by the expanding gas.  Petrol doesn’t detonate on its own, but explodes with oxygen when it is in its gas form, is hot enough (about 257℃) and in the presence of a flame or spark.  Imagine watching someone on a hot day filling their car. Often you see a shimmering effect near the tank filler. This is petrol vapour. The “no smoking” instruction on petrol stations signage and painted on oil tankers is about eliminating one of the three requirements for petrol to catch fire.  Petrol is a high energy compound. These compounds release a lot of energy when they react with other substances. When petrol comes into contact with oxygen and burns, it produces low energy compounds (water and CO₂). The difference in energy between those compounds is seen and heard as sound, heat and light and expansive force.  In order for petrol to explode (rather than just burn) it needs to be under pressure, in the gas form, and have enough oxygen and a source of external energy such as a spark or flame to start the reaction.  Exploding cars  In a car engine, the explosion takes place in a cylinder. The piston compresses the air/petrol mixture to create the high-pressure conditions needed for an explosion. When a gas is compressed, it gets hot. That’s why the tip of a bicycle pump gets hot when you pump your tyres up. As the piston compresses the air/fuel mixture, the pressure and temperature rises.  The spark plug provides the small amount of energy required to make the reaction happen. This process happens several thousand times per minute in car engines.  Petrol and diesel can only explode when under pressure and mixed with air and in the case of petrol, have a small amount of energy added in the form of a spark or a flame. Engines pressurise the fuel/air mixture in the cylinder and so produce small, confined explosions which turn a crankshaft and drive the wheels.  Diesel is less flammable. Diesel engines use a higher boiling point fuel which spontaneously combusts under pressure, which is why diesel engines don’t need spark plugs. Diesel engines also cycle at a lower rate compared to petrol engines, which is why they last longer and offer greater fuel economy.  When cars are involved in collisions, fuel lines are often torn and petrol leaks out onto a hot engine. Liquid petrol can catch fire in the presence of air. But it can’t explode because it’s not under pressure and is in the liquid phase rather than a vapour.  In a car crash, diesel or petrol may occasionally catch fire, but there is no mechanism for creating the high pressures required for them to explode, so they don’t.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlY29udmVyc2F0aW9uLmNvbS9mYXN0LXgtd2h5LWNhcnMtZG9udC1yZWFsbHktZXhwbG9kZS13aGVuLXRoZXktY3Jhc2gtMjA1MDY40gFaaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVjb252ZXJzYXRpb24uY29tL2FtcC9mYXN0LXgtd2h5LWNhcnMtZG9udC1yZWFsbHktZXhwbG9kZS13aGVuLXRoZXktY3Jhc2gtMjA1MDY4?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

For workers manufacturing plastic resin, the high heat used in the production process increases the risks.  Despite the dangers, inspectors with the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration found Sumitomo Bakelite North American Inc. — operating as Durez Corp. in Kenton — has again failed to follow required safety measures to protect workers from the dangers of chemical exposure and potential explosion. OSHA identified similar violations in a 2019 inspection.  In response to a complaint, OSHA opened an investigation in December 2022 and found the company did not prevent resin accumulations from exposing control room workers to respiratory and fire hazards.  ""Durez Corp. knowingly failed to develop and implement safeguards to protect employees from toxic gas releases, explosions from process equipment, and use good housekeeping procedures to protect its employees from potential combustible resin fires,"" explained OSHA Area Director Todd Jensen in Toledo, Ohio. ""This company must make safety as important as profit before employees are sickened or tragedy occurs.""  The agency cited Durez Corp. for one willful violation for its failure to ensure the HVAC system effectively maintained a positive pressure on the control room and automatically shut off in the event of a formaldehyde release and to ensure employees working in the control room would not be injured in the event of a reaction vessel explosion. The company also received one serious citation for lacking an effective housekeeping program to minimize the amount of combustible resin on surfaces throughout the facility.

"explosion","2023-05-18","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 13:52:03","By Keith Loria | May 18, 2023  ADVERTISEMENT  Improvements and innovations in fire and explosion protection have come at a steady pace in recent years, as more companies are investing in products to make things safer and easier while complying with regulations. Pellet Mill Magazine spoke with five industry experts about the latest trends, innovative products and what they believe should be future priorities. Interviewees include: Jeramy Slaunwhite, chief technical officer, explosion safety for Rembe Inc.; David Grandaw, vice president of sales for IEP Technologies; Allen Wagoner, president of FLAMEX Inc.; Jason Krbec, sales engineering manager for CV Technology Inc.; and Eric Peterson, CEO of Fagus GreCon Inc.    PMM: What do you think has been the most significant innovation in fire and explosion protection in recent years?    Slaunwhite: Holistically, the higher awareness and regard for dust explosion hazards and mitigation strategies in industrial processing facilities have greatly improved. Considering combustible dust fires and explosions have been occurring for as long as dusts and powders have been handled, the development and refinement of flame-arresting technology over the past few decades has provided feasible explosion protection solutions for many facilities and industries. Flameless venting allows for reliable explosion protection without harmful fireballs and pressures inside buildings and occupied areas.    Krbec: The most significant innovation is the more cost-effective and advanced design isolation systems, specifically explosion isolation systems for the inlet lines to dust collectors and also the clean air exhaust return lines from dust collectors. We’ve seen more reliable solutions developed, as well as some really improved testing standards for those type of products. It’s been a point of emphasis, because it’s where we see one of the largest gaps in the process industry.    Grandaw: The electromechanical suppressor used for active explosion suppression and isolation systems. For many decades, all styles of high-rate discharge extinguishers used for explosion suppression or isolation systems used some version of pyrotechnical device to activate, such as electro-explosive actuators or gas cartridge actuators. Besides the safe handling considerations necessary for these types of devices, there were often challenges with shipping, as some of these devices required special licensing. In addition, most of the pyrotechnical actuating devices required periodic changeout to ensure proper operation of the extinguisher.    Peterson: As everything gets a little more technically advanced, having things become more intelligent and smarter on their own—as we struggle with labor and a lot of different parts and pieces—is important. The interconnectedness and equipment that delivers things just a little bit easier is very helpful. It’s still new in the fire and explosion side of things.    Wagoner: It’s a broad area, and encompasses a lot. A number of processes employed in the manufacturing of wood pellets present a fire and explosion hazard that must be addressed to ensure workplace safety, protection of assets and avoidance of downtime. Drying and hammer milling of wood material are particularly conducive to the generation of sparks and fire within the pneumatic transport system. Other processes such as pelletizing, pellet cooling, screening and product load out are also subject to possible ignition from sparks, overheated pellets and mechanical friction sources. To combat the all too common problem of dust collector fires and explosions in woodworking industry, we pioneered the use of a new technology in North America by introducing the FLAMEX Spark Detection and Extinguishing System in 1977. Since that time, thousands of have been installed in a variety of industrial facilities across North America, including many medium and large industrial wood pellet operations.    PMM: What product or service designed for this space is your company the proudest of?    Krbec: We developed a completely passive isolation device for clean air exhaust for dust collectors, and one that uses the same technology as our flameless vents—to have an isolation point that doesn’t require any moving components. We call it the Interceptor–QV and developed it a few years back, and we have had a lot of success with it in various industries—not just biomass. It’s won a couple of design awards for safety products.    Grandaw: From a product standpoint, it would be our SmartDS detection system. Most explosion suppression or isolation systems use pressure-activated explosion detectors to initiate explosion control. This is a detection method well proven for many decades. With the SmartDS system, we use a rate-of-pressure rise detection technology that is programmed to respond to explosive rates of pressure rise, thus minimizing false actuations due to process pressure issues. The system has a history buffer that provides graphical evidence of the pressure increases just prior to and during any event leading to a system discharge. This is a great investigation tool for determining that an incipient explosion has been suppressed, resulting in the post-event investigation focusing on corrective action to address the ignition source.    Slaunwhite: At REMBE, one of our major shining achievements is the development of flameless venting technology for dust explosion venting, several decades ago with the Q-Rohr. This has led to our Q-Box flame arrestor and particulate retention device, a flameless explosion vent. The Q-Box is a versatile, economical and third-party tested and certified solution for safe indoor explosion protection in many industries, including food and wood processing.    Peterson: One is a spark detector that has been on the market for about a year and a half. It can basically adapt whether there’s light or not, and actually gets smart and adjusts to the light over time. So, if there’s a hole in the duct work or a flap that opens up, historically, the sensor would just fire off. This one will get smart and realize there’s a certain amount of light, and adjust to it. That type of detection obviously has a lot of benefits for anyone who has extraneous light. The other is GreCon IEM, an intelligent extinguishment system that we just came out with this year. It will monitor the wear of the nozzle and it will also monitor the flow. It helps with proactive maintenance.    Wagoner: Our extinguishing turbine, the MXOne Firefighting Turbine, represents a new generation of stationary firefighting. The system has a 360-degree operating range and allows the application of water mist from a long, safe distance and with high accuracy. When extinguishing a fire with water mist, the water is atomized under high pressure, producing a dramatic increase of water surface which allows a greater efficiency in the absorption of heat. When water evaporates, its volume is increased many times over, which causes a cooling and suffocating effect on the fire. The volume of water consumed during the firefighting effort, as well as the consequential damage caused by the water, are extremely low. The control and direction of the extinguishing turbine can be done fully automatically upon detection by IR Flame Detectors, remotely by mobile devices or manually. Various stationary and mobile control variants can be implemented according to the operator's requirements.    PMM: What aspect of fire and explosion protection could use improvement?    Slaunwhite: In my opinion and observations, the most widespread shortfall regarding combustible dust explosion safety is the do-it-yourself approach to protection equipment with a “good enough” mentality. There are recognized standards for design, performance testing, application and reliability of explosion safety equipment that ensure the equipment will do its job if called upon. The nature of dust explosions is highly chaotic. As such, these standards use testing and calculations based on actual explosion testing to ensure reliable protection. In a high quantity of site inspections, especially in the wood industry, I have observed uncertified and undocumented explosion relief vents and isolation devices, often with visible deterioration. Unlike other fire safety system such as sprinklers, which must be designed and certified by an engineer with listed and approved components without question, dust explosion protection is too often under-designed with no accountability, using questionable equipment. The awareness and standards have certainly been evolving over the past few decades, as has much of industrial technology.    Grandaw: Regular periodic inspections of fire and explosion protection systems. While it is true that these systems are designed for use in the challenging conditions found in industrial plants, if these protection systems are compromised due to lack of proper maintenance, process equipment damage, injury to personnel or worse can happen. Fire and explosion protection systems are like other process-related equipment, needing periodic inspections, and sometimes component replacement when compromised.    Krbec: One of the major things that need to be improved is some of the training and awareness of protection systems themselves. A lot of that goes to the plant operations side. Much of the explosion and fire protection systems are not completely hands-off; they do require some understanding of how to operate and use them properly if you’re doing certain types of process activity. That communication and training is still one of the big gaps we see.    Peterson: One of the big challenges is that most everything in today’s systems and facilities is all wired. There isn't a lot of wireless. Being able to move into some sort of cloud environment where we can go into a lot of different places and not have everything connected back to a system would certainly be extremely beneficial from a time, cost and maintenance perspective. Anything we can do to start connecting these pieces would be big plus.    Wagoner: Owners or operators of a facility where materials determined to be combustible or explosible are present in an enclosure are responsible for obtaining a dust hazard analysis (DHA) in accordance with NFPA 652, Chapter 7. A DHA is a written document that is prepared by a qualified individual to identify specific hazards in the facility, and to provide prescriptive measures to be taken to address those identified hazards. The DHA is to be reviewed and updated every five years. Many facility owners are unaware of this requirement or have failed to take steps to have one conducted. It is widely believed that this is the first step in addressing the dangers of potential fires and explosions that are largely inherent in facilities that handle combustible dusts.

"explosion","2009-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Knoxville"", ""Tennessee"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 16:56:00","Over 33 million individuals in the United States are currently driving vehicles equipped with airbag inflators that pose a potential fatality risk. These inflators have the rare possibility of exploding during a collision a releasing dangerous shrapnel.  And only a tiny fraction of drivers know it.  And because of a dispute between federal safety regulators and an airbag parts manufacturer, they aren't likely to find out anytime soon.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is demanding that the manufacturer, ARC Automotive of Knoxville, Tennessee, recall 67 million inflators that could explode with such force as to blow apart a metal canister and expel shrapnel. But ARC is refusing to do so, setting up a possible court fight with the agency.  NHTSA argues that the recall is justified because two people have been killed in the United States and Canada and at least seven others have been injured by ARC's inflators. The explosions, which first occurred in 2009, have continued as recently as this year.  After an investigation that lasted for eight years, NHTSA tentatively concluded that the inflators are defective. The agency's documents show that the inflators date from at least the 2002 model year to January 2018, when ARC installed equipment on its manufacturing lines that could detect potential safety problems.  One of those who died was Marlene Beaudoin, a 40-year-old mother of 10 from Michigan's Upper Peninsula who was struck by metal fragments when her 2015 Chevrolet Traverse SUV was involved in a minor crash in 2021. She and four of her sons had been on their way to get ice cream. The sons were not hurt.  ARC maintains that no safety defect exists, that NHTSA's demand is based on a hypothesis rather than technical conclusions and that the agency has no authority to order a parts manufacturer to carry out recalls, which ARC contends are the responsibility of automakers.  In a letter to NHTSA, ARC said no automaker had found a defect common to all 67 million inflators, and no root cause has been identified in the inflator ruptures.  ""ARC believes they resulted from random 'one-off' manufacturing anomalies that were properly addressed by vehicle manufacturers through lot-specific recalls,"" the letter said.  In a statement, NHTSA indicated that both ARC and automakers are responsible for recalls and that it can seek a recall from a parts maker that supplies multiple automakers.  The next step is for NHTSA to issue a final ruling on whether the inflators are defective, then hold a public hearing. It potentially could take ARC to court to seek a recall order. NHTSA would not say when or whether any of this will happen.  In the meantime, owners of vehicles made by at least a dozen automakers – Chevrolet, Buick, GMC, Ford, Toyota, Stellantis, Volkswagen, Audi, BMW, Porsche, Hyundai and Kia – are left to wonder anxiously whether their vehicles contain driver or front passenger inflators made by ARC. (Some vehicles have ARC inflators on both sides.)  Because ARC supplies inflators that are included in other manufacturers' airbags, there's no easy way for vehicle owners to determine whether their inflators are made by ARC. Neither NHTSA nor ARC nor the automakers have released a full list of affected models.  The standoff with ARC has sent automakers struggling to find out just how many of their vehicles contain the inflators. The auto manufacturers are also asking NHTSA whether they must start doing recalls. Automakers know many of the models affected. But many say they're still gathering information from later model years to determine which vehicles contain the affected inflators.  ""We are still investigating,"" said Maria Buczkowski, a spokesperson for Ford. ""We have not had any ARC airbag inflators rupture in the field.""  James Bell, a Kia spokesperson, said, ""We do not have a final count on vehicles that were built with ARC inflators, but the team is collecting the data.""  Toyota confirmed that some of its vehicles have ARC inflators but wouldn't comment further.  Other automakers said they were trying to find a cause and were working with the government or didn't respond to requests for information.  NHTSA contends that byproducts from welding during manufacturing can clog a vent inside the inflator canister that's designed to let gas escape to fill airbags quickly in a crash. Pressure can build to the point where the canister is blown apart.  Michael Brooks, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety, called on NHTSA and the automakers to release a list of affected models.  ""Customers, I think, have a right to know if there's a potential defect in their car, particularly if it's sitting a few inches from their chest and can explode,"" Brooks said.  The situation, he said, is reminiscent of the early stages of the Takata airbag inflator recalls in 2001. It took years for all the affected vehicle models to be announced.  Both ARC and Takata used ammonium nitrate to inflate airbags. Takata's situation was more dangerous, Brooks said, because, in its inflators, the chemical could deteriorate over time when exposed to high heat and humidity. Unlike Takata, ARC uses ammonium nitrate only as a secondary chemical to inflate airbags. ARC's problem appears to derive instead from a manufacturing defect.  From 2017 to 2022, the ARC problems triggered seven small recalls from automakers. On Friday, the same day NHTSA announced its action against ARC, General Motors announced the recall of nearly 1 million more.  The company said it's recalling certain 2014 through 2017 GMC Acadia, Chevy Traverse and Buick Enclave SUVs because the ARC inflators can explode. The recall came after GM was told this year that the driver'sairbagg ruptured in a 2017 Traverse. GM, which says it doesn't know what caused the inflator to explode, has hired an engineering firm to help investigate.  ""We disagree with NHTSA's new sweeping request when extensive field testing has found no inherent defect,"" ARC said in a statement.  While the recall demand is being sorted out, Brooks of the Center for Auto Safety recommends that owners of vehicles from the 12 affected brands insist dealers disclose whether their particular vehicle contains an ARC inflator.  ""The more customers who complain, the more pressure that puts on the manufacturers,"" he said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5c2FiYWguY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2F1dG9tb3RpdmUvb3Zlci0zMG0tdXMtZHJpdmVycy11bmF3YXJlLW9mLXBvdGVudGlhbC1kZWFkbHktYWlyYmFnLWV4cGxvc2lvbtIBc2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5c2FiYWguY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2F1dG9tb3RpdmUvb3Zlci0zMG0tdXMtZHJpdmVycy11bmF3YXJlLW9mLXBvdGVudGlhbC1kZWFkbHktYWlyYmFnLWV4cGxvc2lvbi9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"explosion","1683-05-20","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 18:00:43","This image of the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A, the first object observed by NASA’s Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) satellite, combines two sets of telescope data. X-ray data from IXPE is in magenta and higher-energy X-rays from NASA's Chandra X-Ray Observatory are in blue.  An unexpected effect sighted in supernova wreckage may be caused by a highly magnetized neutron star, or magnetar, and quantum activity never seen before.  Like all neutron stars, magnetars form when massive stars end their lives in a collapse that also triggers a massive supernova explosion. The matter that composes neutron stars is so dense that a sugar cube of it would weigh over a billion tons on Earth. The magnetic fields around these star remnants are the most powerful in the known universe, often 100 trillion times stronger than that of our planet.  As such neutron stars and magnetars represent the most extreme celestial objects, the investigation of them is vital to better understanding the universe. The new study, published April 18 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (opens in new tab), examines the remnants surrounding the supernova leftovers of Cassiopeia A. The explosion was visible to Earth 340 years ago.  Related: Why magnetars should freak you out  Astronomers have always suspected that magnetars would generate highly polarized X-rays around them, meaning that the electromagnetic field of the magnetars' radiation vibrates in a preferred direction.  But, scientists were surprised in 2022 when data collected by NASA's Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) satellite, which launched the year before, showed polarization may depend on energy. IXPE information suggested that may be the case after looking at X-rays in the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A around the magnetar 4U 0142+61, located 13,000 light-years away.  As the first-ever measurement of the polarization of X-rays around a magnetar, the IXPE observations showed that lower energy X-rays were polarized at 180 degrees to the high-energy X-rays. Both energetic ray sets were oriented at 90 degrees to the electromagnetic field of the magnetar.  ""Photon metamorphosis,"" meaning the transformation of X-ray photons into electrons and positrons, may be able to explain the weird behavior of X-rays around magnetars, Cornell University astrophysics professor Dong Lai said in a May 4 statement (opens in new tab). ""Photon metamorphosis"" is an element of quantum electrodynamics (QED) , which is a field of physics examining subatomic interactions between electrons and photons.  ""In this observation of radiation from a faraway celestial object, we see a beautiful effect that is a manifestation of intricate, fundamental physics,"" Lai said. ""QED is one of the most successful physics theories, but it had not been tested in such strong magnetic field conditions.""

Lai said that in this phase, photons that have no electric charge could convert into a virtual pair of particles (an electron and a positron) that have equal and opposite charges but still combine to a net zero charge. Because they have a charge, however, these particles are influenced by the magnetar's powerful magnetic field. The polarity could therefore cause high-energy X-rays to swing 90 degrees relative to low-energy X-rays.  ""You can think about the polarization as two flavors of photons,"" Lai continued. ""A photon suddenly converting from one flavor to another — you don't usually see this kind of thing. But it's a natural consequence of the physics, if you apply the theory under these extreme conditions.""  An artist's impression of a magnetar. (Image credit: ESO/L. Calçada)  (opens in new tab)  When IXPE examined another magnetar called 1RXS J170849.0–400910, with an even more powerful magnetic field, the same ""swing"" in the polarization of low and high energy X-rays was not spotted. Lai said that his calculations can account for this; they suggest vacuum resonance and photon metamorphosis would occur very deep inside such a neutron star.  As well as potentially explaining the strange polarization of X-rays seen around 4U 0142+61, Lai said that his interpretation of IXPE data helps constrain the strength of its magnetic field and the rate at which it rotates. The findings also suggest that the atmosphere of this magnetar is composed in part of ionized heavy elements.  Lai said the study of neutron stars helps scientists better understand the physics of matter in conditions that couldn't ever be simulated ever on Earth, meaning it adds to our understanding of the universe's beauty and diversity.  ""The observations by IXPE have opened a new window for studying the surface environment of neutron stars,"" Lai said. ""This will lead to new insights into these enigmatic objects.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwYWNlLmNvbS9jYXNzaW9wZWlhLWEtc3VwZXJub3ZhLXJlbW5hbnQtbWFnbmV0YXItbmV1dHJvbi1zdGFy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Elon Musk-led company has requested a six-month window from June 15 to December 15 to launch a Starship prototype to Earth’s orbit from the company’s Starbase facility in Boca Chica, Texas, according to the application. The FCC regulates all spacecraft communication in Earth’s orbit. SpaceX hasn’t said whether Starship’s second orbital launch attempt will carry any payload, but said in Monday’s application an FCC “special temporary authority” is necessary for the mission. Before going interplanetary, Starship will first be used as a regular launch vehicle to send SpaceX’s Starlink satellites and other payloads to Earth’s orbit. To actually launch, SpaceX will also need permission from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which issues rocket launch licenses.  Starship’s first orbital test exploded  SpaceX attempted the first orbital launch of Starship on April 20 from Boca Chica. A nearly 400-foot-tall rocket prototype, comprised of an upper stage called SN20 and a Super Heavy booster, lifted off successfully and soared to about 20 miles in the sky before blowing up. The explosion damaged the rocket’s launch pad and scattered debris and dust for miles from the launch site.  The result wasn’t a complete surprise. Musk said before the launch there was only a 50 percent chance of Starship reaching orbit on the first attempt. He considered the test a success and tweeted that the SpaceX team “learned a lot for [the] next test launch in a few months.”  FAA is conducting a “mishap investigation” into Starship’s first test launch. It’s part of a standard procedure following an anomaly during a rocket launch such as an explosion.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vb2JzZXJ2ZXIuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvc3BhY2V4LXN0YXJzaGlwLW9yYml0YWwtdGVzdC1kYXRlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Officers arrested L'Donpatrick Bones, 42, in a room at the Days Inn at 901 Fair Park Ave. around 9:50 p.m., about three hours after they discovered the explosive components during a traffic stop near 5322 Asher Ave.  Police said they identified Bones as the possible owner of the components after interviewing the two people in the vehicle during the stop, Barry Poindexter, 45, and Brittany Brown, 29. Officers pulled over Poindexter because he was observed speeding, and he told them he did not have a valid license, police said.  A search of the vehicle located containers of a crystalline substance and a bag containing a yellow cord connected to a silver object that the officers recognized as a blasting cap, police said. Police cleared the area while Little Rock Fire Department bomb squad technicians examined the items.  The technicians identified the substance as ammonium nitrate and nitro methane connected to a commercial-grade blasting cap and declared the scene safe.  Ammonium nitrate is a component in explosives used in mining and construction. Nitro methane is also explosive and is also a component in the fuel used by drag racing cars. Blasting caps serve as ignition sources for larger explosive charges.  Poindexter and Brown were released to Maumelle police, where they had active warrants, after questioning and did not face any charges in the incident Saturday, a police incident report states.  Bones was at the motel with three other people when police arrived and arrested him, police said. More drugs and a gun were found in the room, police said.

"explosion","2023-01-01","Not Discerned","{""NewYork"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 17:57:00","New York, NY  --News Direct--  The world of cryptocurrency continues to exhilarate investors - with predictive insights becoming more valuable than ever as these investors seek market-beating returns.  OpenAI's powerful language model, ChatGPT, has become a widely-used tool in this regard, shedding light on potential high performers in the crypto landscape.  In this article, we'll explore five promising cryptocurrencies that, per ChatGPT's analysis, are poised for explosive growth this year.  1. AiDoge ($AI)  The first crypto that ChatGPT is heavily bullish on is AiDoge ($AI) – an AI-powered meme generation platform built on the Ethereum blockchain.  AiDoge's compelling use cases have attracted investor attention, meaning the project has now raised over $8.6 million in funding through its ongoing presale.  Investors are excited by the potential applications for AiDoge's meme generator, which looks to streamline the process of creating hilarious images for social media platforms like Twitter and Reddit.  Additionally, AiDoge's earnings protocol rewards meme creators with $AI, the platform's native ERC-20 token, for generating images that resonate with the wider community.  The combination of these features has piqued the interest of crypto-savvy investors – but what does ChatGPT think?  Per ChatGPT's analysis, the $AI token's value could rise to $0.00336 by the end of 2023 – representing a 100x return for those who invest at the intended exchange listing price of $0.0000336.  This bullish forecast will be great news for early AiDoge.com investors. Fortunately for those not yet involved, AiDoge's presale is still ongoing – with $AI tokens currently priced at $0.0000308.  Visit AiDoge Presale  2. yPredict ($YPRED)  Another project that's making waves in the crypto market is yPredict ($YPRED) . This Polygon-based ecosystem looks to revolutionize digital asset investors' research and analysis process by providing a comprehensive suite of advanced tools and features.  The yPredict ecosystem boasts features such as automatic pattern recognition, advanced technical indicators, AI-powered price forecasts, and investor sentiment analysis.  On top of all that, yPredict's platform will also have a predictive model marketplace, where AI specialists can market their creations, allowing retail investors to access them for a monthly or annual fee.  This fee will be paid in $YPRED – yPredict's native ERC-20 token. Although transactions will be $YPRED's primary use case, token holders can also stake their holdings and generate regular rewards.  Like with AiDoge, ChatGPT appears optimistic about yPredict's prospects. As noted by ChatGPT, positive fundamentals and a bullish crypto market could help the $YPRED price increase post-launch.  As such, ChatGPT estimates that $YPRED could hit $1.20 by the end of 2023 – which would be a 900% increase from the expected listing price.  However, ChatGPT also highlights the looming threat of regulatory change – a factor that could hamper the progress of many new crypto projects, including yPredict.  Visit yPredict Presale  3. Ecoterra ($ECOTERRA)  Ecoterra ($ECOTERRA) is an eco-friendly crypto project that seeks to reward individuals and businesses for being more sustainable.  The project's flagship feature is its ""Recycle2Earn"" app, which provides tokenized rewards every time a user recycles glass, plastic, cardboard, and other materials. These rewards are distributed in $ECOTERRA – the project's native token.  Alongside this Recycle2Earn app, the Ecoterra ecosystem will also have a carbon offset marketplace where individuals and businesses can buy offsets to reduce their carbon footprint.  Ecoterra goes beyond just tokenized rewards for recycling; it will also host a marketplace for recycled materials. This marketplace will enable businesses to conveniently acquire used resources, offering payment options in $ECOTERRA and other prominent cryptocurrencies.  Given the pressing threat of global warming, the need for sustainability-focused crypto projects like Ecoterra is higher than ever.  This could contribute to the demand for $ECOTERRA tokens once the project's presale ends – with ChatGPT forecasting that the token's value could soar as high as $0.50 by the end of 2023.  Considering prospective investors can buy $ECOTERRA tokens for $0.00775 during Stage 6 of the presale phase, this presents a unique opportunity for a substantial return on investment, should ChatGPT's forecast prove accurate.  Visit Ecoterra Presale  4. Polygon ($MATIC)  Polygon ($MATIC) is a blockchain platform that aims to create a multi-chain system that can be integrated with the Ethereum network.  The Polygon platform is fast, secure, and scalable – making it an appealing option for the developers of large decentralized applications (dApps).  Moreover, Polygon uses a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which is significantly more energy-efficient than the proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism used by chains like Bitcoin and Dogecoin.  Although the price of $MATIC, Polygon's native token, has fallen substantially since late February, ChatGPT remains optimistic about its prospects.  According to ChatGPT, the $MATIC price could return to $1.70 by the end of 2023 – a level that hasn't been seen since March 2022.  For this to occur, ChatGPT states that Polygon would need to continue its mission of scaling Ethereum transactions and growing the number of dApps that utilize the network.  5. Kaspa ($KAS)  Last but not least is Kaspa ($KAS). Kaspa is a PoW cryptocurrency that uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) protocol, meaning blocks can be created in parallel, providing scope for super-quick transaction speeds.  Through this system, Kaspa aims to be a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) payment system that can outmatch Bitcoin in terms of scalability.  Moreover, the Kaspa project is entirely open-source, and the mainnet was launched with no pre-mining – meaning that no single entity has control over the $KAS token supply.  This has undoubtedly contributed to ChatGPT's positivity around the project. Per ChatGPT, the $KAS price could reverse its current downtrend and reach $0.475 by the end of the year – a price increase of 150%.  However, as with all of ChatGPT's predictions, the chatbot does urge caution – as factors like market conditions, adoption rates, and roadmap delays could impact any bullish price forecast.

Marathon said the cause of the Monday morning fire was under investigation. Aerial footage from Houston television stations showed crews trying to put out flames at the Galveston Bay refinery, which is along a stretch of Texas coast that is heavily populated by petrochemical facilities.  Neither the company nor authorities immediately said whether anyone else was injured.  “The safety of our workers and the community is our top priority, and a full investigation will be conducted to determine the cause of the incident,” Marathon said in a statement.  Fires at refineries in the area are not uncommon. Earlier this month, a fire at a Shell facility in nearby Deer Park sent nine workers to the hospital and caused massive plumes of smoke.  In March, an explosion and fire at a facility owned by INEOS Phenol in nearby Pasadena, Texas, left one injured.  The fire comes after a 2005 explosion – one of the worst refinery explosions in U.S. history – left 15 dead and 180 others injured at this same facility, which was then owned by BP. It was sold to Marathon in 2013, renamed the Galveston Bay refinery and in 2018 merged with another Marathon facility to become what it is today, according to previous statements by BP and Marathon.

"explosion","2017-12-05","Not Discerned","{""Chicago"", ""Illinois"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 02:01:34","Artificial intelligence could be a useful tool in mental health treatment, according to the results of a new pilot study led by University of Illinois Chicago researchers.  The study, which was the first to test an AI voice-based virtual coach for behavioral therapy, found changes in patients’ brain activity along with improved depression and anxiety symptoms after using Lumen, an AI voice assistant that delivered a form of psychotherapy.  The UIC team says the results, which are published in the journal Translational Psychiatry, offer encouraging evidence that virtual therapy can play a role in filling the gaps in mental health care, where waitlists and disparities in access are often hurdles that patients, particularly from vulnerable communities, must overcome to receive treatment.  “We’ve had an incredible explosion of need, especially in the wake of COVID, with soaring rates of anxiety and depression and not enough practitioners,” said Dr. Olusola A. Ajilore, UIC professor of psychiatry and co-first author of the paper. “This kind of technology may serve as a bridge. It’s not meant to be a replacement for traditional therapy, but it may be an important stop-gap before somebody can seek treatment.”  Lumen, which operates as a skill in the Amazon Alexa application, was developed by Ajilore and study senior author Dr. Jun Ma, the Beth and George Vitoux Professor of Medicine at UIC, along with collaborators at Washington University in St. Louis and Pennsylvania State University, with the support of a $2 million grant from the National Institute of Mental Health.  The UIC researchers recruited over 60 patients for the clinical study exploring the application’s effect on mild-to-moderate depression and anxiety symptoms, and activity in brain areas previously shown to be associated with the benefits of problem-solving therapy.  Two-thirds of the patients used Lumen on a study-provided iPad for eight problem-solving therapy sessions, with the rest serving as a “waitlist” control receiving no intervention.  After the intervention, study participants using the Lumen app showed decreased scores for depression, anxiety and psychological distress compared with the control group. The Lumen group also showed improvements in problem-solving skills that correlated with increased activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a brain area associated with cognitive control. Promising results for women and underrepresented populations also were found.  “It’s about changing the way people think about problems and how to address them, and not being emotionally overwhelmed,” Ma said. “It’s a pragmatic and patient-driven behavior therapy that’s well established, which makes it a good fit for delivery using voice-based technology.”  A larger trial comparing the use of Lumen with both a control group on a waitlist, and patients receiving human-coached problem-solving therapy is currently being conducted by the researcher. They stress that the virtual coach doesn’t need to perform better than a human therapist to fill a desperate need in the mental health system.  “The way we should think about digital mental health service is not for these apps to replace humans, but rather to recognize what a gap we have between supply and demand, and then find novel, effective and safe ways to deliver treatments to individuals who otherwise do not have access, to fill that gap,” Ma said.  Co-first author of the study is Thomas Kannampallil at Washington University in St. Louis.  Other co-investigators include Aifeng Zhang, Nan Lv, Nancy E. Wittels, Corina R. Ronneberg, Vikas Kumar, Susanth Dosala, Amruta Barve, Kevin C. Tan, Kevin K. Cao, Charmi R. Patel and Emily A. Kringle, all of UIC; Joshua Smyth and Jillian A.

The bird did not survive.  The unusual incident - and unfortunate one for lovers of ornithology -- was strangely familiar to the Diamondbacks, as it immediately invoked memories of one of the team's -- and MLB's -- most bizarre pitching highlights. During a spring training game in 2001, Diamondbacks Hall of Fame pitcher Randy Johnson famously hit a bird while on the mound, obliterating the bird in an explosion of feathers.  The incident with Gallen's bird was much less dramatic, as the bird would only fall to the ground as his pitch was redirected.  The incident with Gallen was the latest in a select few examples of the ballpark being a perilous place for birds. In 1985, for instance, New York Yankees star Dave Winfield hit and killed a seagull while warming up in the middle of the fifth inning.  Gallen enters Wednesday's game having had a strong season so far, with a 2.35 ERA, 6-1 record, 0.855 WHIP and 70 strikeouts in 57 1/3 innings across nine starts.Gallen's WHIP mark is currently the best in the National League.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNzcG9ydHMuY29tL21sYi9uZXdzL2RpYW1vbmRiYWNrcy1waXRjaGVyLXphYy1nYWxsZW4taGl0cy1iaXJkLWR1cmluZy13YXJtdXBzLXN0aXJyaW5nLXVwLW1lbW9yaWVzLW9mLXJhbmR5LWpvaG5zb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"explosion","2023-09-01","22:00:00","{""Brooklyn"", ""Ohio"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 14:09:18","Today, with the release of their latest single ""Stumbling Still,"" Nation of Language have shared an explosive new preview of the frenetic energy and intense array of feelings that make up their forthcoming album, Strange Disciple. Out September 15th on [PIAS], and recently named one of the most anticipated albums of summer by Pitchfork, the ten-song collection is connected through themes of hopeless devotion, infatuation and overwhelming obsession, presented as the ideal soundtrack for long walks through city streets. Whereas lead singer and songwriter Ian Devaney imagines the band's 2020 debut, Introduction, Presence, as taking place in a car – and second album A Way Forward occurring on and as a locomotive – Strange Disciple is, at last, ambulatory and wayfaring, informed by the excitement of exploring new places the Brooklyn trio never thought they would see or play during their remarkable pandemic-era breakout. Clamoring with a propulsive kraut-punk groove and bouncing bassline, ""Stumbling Still"" encapsulates that form of forward motion, with lyrics that deliver an equally restless but far less healthy series of incessant thoughts and internal strife. Listen to ""Stumbling Still"" Here Premiered via KCRW, ""Stumbling Still"" arrives on the heels of the soaring ""Sole Obsession,"" which ""cloaks its emotional vulnerability in an avalanche of synthesizer and a rapid tempo"" (Billboard), as well as album opener ""Weak In Your Light,"" hailed as both an ""excellent exploration of passion and agony"" and a ""subdued re-introduction to the best synth-pop band in the world"" (Paste). Through Devaney's towering vocal performance, he fluctuates between fixation and shame, bringing the listener down a turbulent path of self-exploration and showing that one should not shy away from the brief pain necessary to make a much-needed change. Like the rest of Strange Disciple, ""Stumbling Still"" was produced by Nick Millhiser (Holy Ghost!, LCD Soundsystem), and recorded in his East Williamsburg studio, as it sees Nation of Language considering the creative choices that would be most compelling to perform on-stage, for the first time. Incorporating more live drums, guitar and shoegaze influences into their arrangements than ever before, the band expand their new wave, post-punk and synth-powered sound with newfound fervor. Ahead of Pitchfork Festival, Primavera Sound, Outside Lands and nearly 60 more US, UK and EU performances that Nation of Language have already announced for 2023, the band are just beginning to debut music from Strange Disciple live. Earlier this month, during an unforgettable night documented by Rolling Stone, they headlined their largest hometown show to date at Brooklyn Steel. As Consequence praised, ""Nation of Language put star power on display...each entrancing track was perfectly executed, and now they've got us hungry for more."" Tonight the band headlines LA's Fonda Theatre, before two sold-out stops in Seattle this week, each with support from Reggie Watts.

"explosion","2023-04-10","Not Discerned","{""Dimmitt"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 00:03:48","DIMMITT, Texas (AP) — A fire and explosion at a dairy farm in the Texas Panhandle that injured one person and killed an estimated 18,000 head of cattle was an accident that started with an engine fire in a manure vacuum truck cleaning part of the massive barn, according to state investigators.  A State Fire Marshal report of the April 10 fire at the Southfork Dairy Farm about 50 miles (80 kilometers) southwest of Amarillo did not determine what caused the engine fire, but found there was “no intentional act to cause a failure.” The April 24 report said the investigation was closed.  A worker driving the truck through a section of the 2 million-square-foot barn told investigators he noticed what he first thought was steam coming from the engine compartment. He tried to drive out of the barn when he realized it was a fire, but couldn’t make it.  The driver said he tried to put out the fire with two extinguishers but failed. Several other employees told investigators they rushed to help, but the fire quickly spread.  The report noted the dairy farm had a second manure hauling truck on the property outside of the barn. A dairy manager told investigators it too had previously burned. The report noted burn marks near the engine compartment consistent with the truck fire inside the barn.

"explosion","2023-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 13:01:09","There was another huge week on the crypto market as meme coins HOMER and SAUDI PEPE explode. Continuing the trend that started earlier this year, more and more meme coins are pumping and wreaking havoc on the market. Apparently, there is something about meme coins that makes people more than eager to buy as many as they can.  However, investors are eyeing these tokens with suspicions and many of them are opting for more secure options, like AiDoge (AI) and SpongeBobBob (SPONGE). Both of these tokens represent a far better opportunity, focused on the future rather than instant pump-and-dump schemes.  >>> Buy AiDoge Now<<<  HOMER Is A Token With No Promises, No Roadmap, And No Usefulness  Dubbed the DOH Coin, HOMER is a meme coin based on the famous Homer Simpson character. The token made quite a splash on Dexscanner, coming in second with only ETH performing better. This massive success came on the heels of a troublesome presale, which makes it even more impressive.  The HOMER presale ran into troubles almost as soon as it started. Poor security led to a massive bot attack that paralyzed the network and caused a lot of trouble for developers. Regardless, they weren’t deterred and decided to punch through.  The daily trading volume confirmed that their decision was the right one, as people seemingly can’t get enough of HOMER tokens. For the last several days, 24-hour trading volume is constantly north of 440 million, pushing the price upward.  As with most meme coins, HOMER doesn’t have any utility or purpose for that matter. Its value depends solely on the hype its community can create. That is the biggest concern major investors shave about the token and the reason why so many of them decided to opt out and look for better alternatives for investing.  >>> Buy AiDoge Now<<<  SAUDI PEPE – The Arabian Version of Popular Pepe Coin Is Pumping  Pumping more than 1,400% in just one day, Saudi Pepe is among the best-performing cryptocurrencies on the market. Mimicking the token it was named after, Saudi Pepe is performing miraculously on the market, spurring a mad dash among the investors to catch it before it peaks out.  Saudi Pepe is a community project that plays heavily on FOMO in people who missed out on the original Pepe Coin. Judging by the enormous spike in both value and trading volume, the strategy seems to be working exceedingly well. Investors from all over the world are rushing to crypto exchanges and gobbling up the token.  However, some experts warn that not everything is ideal. In fact, there are several glaring red flags that are preventing whales from jumping on board. First is the lack of any info on the team behind the project. Second, and perhaps even more important, is the fear of yet another pump-and-dump scheme, with several anonymous wallets holding huge numbers of the token. If dumped all at once, the price will take a nosedive, leaving smaller investors holding the bag.  >>> Buy SpongeBob Token Now<<<  AiDoge Breaks All Records Raising over $8 Million in Presale  The AI craze sparked by ChatGPT has reached the crypto market in a form of a fun and entertaining app called AiDoge. For some, using a tool as powerful as an AI for generating memes may seem frivolous, but only to those who do not understand the importance of memes in modern online communication. Not only are they an accepted lingua franca for younger generations across the globe, but they are also entertaining.  Creating memes with AiDoge is very simple. All you need is an idea to type in the console and the powerful AI under the hood will do the rest. It will search the net for appropriate images, devise text, and offer you a finished product you can instantly share with your friends.  AiDoge will also feature a handy Meme2Earn function, allowing the best memes to be rewarded with AIDOGE tokens. This will provide the best creators with a source of income and yet another reason to use the app.  The fact that the AIDOGE presale already raised over $8 million in mere weeks is a testament to how popular the concept is. Based on this, many experts predict that AIDOGE will be the next meme coin to explode in 2023, as soon as it hits the open market.  >>> Buy SpongeBob Token Now<<<  SPONGE May Be The Next Big Thing for Meme Coins  SpongeBob token was launched on May 4th and by May 7th it pumped 3179.45%, making it one of the best-performing tokens on the market. For comparison’s sake, in the same period, Pepe Coin gained 271%, vastly underperforming compared to SpongeBob.  Based on the SpongeBobBob SquarePants cartoon character, SpongeBob token followed an unorthodox path to fame. It had a stealth launch on Uniswap DEX, but the word of mouth quickly spread and the token found its way to CoinMarketCap. Just on its first day, SpongeBob gained more than 2,000% for its early investors.  The SpongeBob community is extremely well organized, creating a huge online presence early on. Its Twitter account already has more than 40k followers. The social media campaign was successfully leveraged to incur even higher gains, ending up with SpongeBob’s explosion.  Some experts claim that this is only the beginning. Even though SpongeBob has cooled off some in the last few days, it still remains one of the most prospective meme coins on the market. We can easily see it repeating its amazing gains before the end of 2023.  >>> Buy SpongeBob Token Now<<<  Conclusion  Despite spectacular performances from both Homer and Saudi Pepe, we wouldn’t recommend investing in either of them. There are simply too many unclear issues about these tokens and this lack of transparency is usually a clear indicator of some nefarious intentions. If you are looking for good meme coin investment options, AI and SPONGE are clearly far superior options in every regard.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuYWx5dGljc2luc2lnaHQubmV0L21lbWUtY29pbnMtb24tdGhlLXJpc2UtaG9tZXItc2F1ZGktcGVwZS1leHBsb2RlLWJ1dC1haWRvZ2Utc3BvbmdlLWFyZS10aGUtZnV0dXJlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Noah Calderon, 22, made his first court appearance this week for a federal charge of possession of a destructive device, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Texas said in a news release Tuesday detailing the investigation.  Prosecutors said the FBI was first alerted to Calderon in October after he allegedly posted about white supremacist ideology and a fascination with high-profile mass shootings, ""particularly the 1999 massacre at Columbine High School,"" the statement read.  Calderon's social media included pictures of himself in tactical-style vests with AR-15-style rifles and handguns along with Columbine-themed memes, prosecutors said.  ""This defendant exhibited several indicators of potential violence: a fascination with mass shooters, an obsession with weapons, and hatred towards a protected class. What's worse, he had allegedly progressed from ideation to planning and preparation,"" U.S. Attorney Leigha Simonton said in the news release.  Months later in March, the FBI received a tip that Calderon had detonated a homemade bomb in a residential neighborhood. The explosion prompted several 911 calls about a loud concussive sound and smoke.  ""Shortly thereafter, agents reviewed Mr. Calderon's Google account and found searches for the Columbine killers, the Charleston church shooter, 'pipe bomb how to make,' 'how to make propane bombs,' and 'wear [sic] were the propane bombs in Columbine,' as well as searches of the names of several local public schools. They also searched e-commerce activity, which showed that Mr. Calderon allegedly bought two pounds of potassium perchlorate, one pound of aluminum powder, and a striped fuse online,"" the release said.  A man is in custody and facing weapons charges after a search of his home Monday raised concerns of a potential explosion risk and prompted evacuations.  Calderon was taken into custody in April after Burleson Police and the FBI raided his home and found ""items that could be used to make and detonate a bomb."" Among the evidence taken from the home was a glass jar marked ""frag,"" which contained metal BBs and lead, and 659.2 grams of explosive powder, the release said.  Investigators also found what they described as a handwritten ""manifesto"" which ""glorified the Columbine shooters and espoused white supremacy,"" the release said.  NBC 5 News Investigators search a home along the 700 block of Pecan Street in Burleson, Monday, April 17, 2023.  ""In apprehending Mr. Calderon, we may have averted mass tragedy. We are especially grateful to the tipster who alerted law enforcement to Mr. Calderon's concerning social media posts,"" Simonton stated.  Calderon was charged on April 18 and indicted on May 10 on one count of possession of a destructive device. He made his initial appearance before U.S. Magistrate Judge Jeffrey L. Cureton on Monday.  He faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted.

The film is the continuation of 2020's Extraction, which was based on the graphic novel Ciudad by Ande Parks and Avengers Endgame directors Joe Russo and Anthony Russo. Tyler finds himself in the middle of a life-threatening mission in Bangladesh, trying to save the son of an incarcerated Indian drug lord.

He told the publication: “For me, the image of Chris Hemsworth beating the s**t out of a bunch of prisoners, while on fire, in the snow was something that I couldn’t pass up. And hats off to Chris. It wasn’t CG fire. And he had to do it over and over.”  Talking to Netflix, Sam said of the sequel: ""The goal was to dive deeper into the backstory of Tyler Rake and find out what makes him tick.

However, both times, the Wolverines lost in the semifinal. Now, there are concerns that to take the next step forward, Michigan needs to be more explosive in the passing game.  Offensive coordinator Sherrone Moore agreed with that sentiment, explaining that the team has been working on being more consistent this spring.  “I think we have areas that we need to fix, things that we need to be able to exploit defenses more,” Sherrone Moore said. “And we’ve got to be more consistent, whether that’s ball placement, catches, all those things and that just gives you more confidence when you gameplan and things.”  In 2022, Michigan relied heavily on its running game, throwing for just 219.9 yards per game. That was 83rd in the country for that stat.  “And I think in the spring we fixed a lot of those areas, which is really gonna help us when we get to the fall.”  Despite the team struggling to gain yards in the passing game, Sherrone Moore and Michigan are expecting quarterback JJ McCarthy is going to show a lot of improvement in 2022.  “First thing is confidence,” Moore said.  “Just his confidence. He was always a quiet confident kid. But now you can see it zoomed in the way he just walks around, the way he approaches the film room, the way he walks on the field. When he gets out of the huddle, or he looks to the sideline for a play, like the dude just looks like he’s dynamic. Just in the way he approaches everything.”  Sherrone Moore on the potential of Michigan’s wide receivers  JJ McCarthy is going to need some help in the passing game from Michigan’s wide receivers. Luckily, Sherrone Moore thinks the Michigan wide receivers have as much potential as anyone.  “They have potential to be as good as any group in the country. It’s just on the continual work habits that they have, and what they’ve been doing. CJ [Cornelius Johnson] had an outstanding spring. Fixed some things that we wanted him to fix. We put him in a couple different positions to see how he would manage, and he’s just a smart football player, savvy football player. Roman [Wilson] continues to be Roman. Fast, explosive, doing all the things he’s doing. And then exciting to get AJ [Henning] back,” Moore said.  “The other guy that showed up obviously in the spring in Peyton O’Leary, you know who really, really stood out, and he did that all spring. So excited to see him get his chances and roll, and just keep rolling with this group. The young receivers are super dynamic and exciting, so excited for the future of this group and where they are.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5vbjMuY29tL2NvbGxlZ2UvbWljaGlnYW4td29sdmVyaW5lcy9uZXdzL3NoZXJyb25lLW1vb3JlLWFkZHJlc3Nlcy1pZGVhLW1pY2hpZ2FuLW5lZWRzLXRvLWJlLW1vcmUtZXhwbG9zaXZlLW9uLW9mZmVuc2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Given the optimism, it could be wise to add fundamentally strong coal stocks Peabody Energy Corporation (BTU), Alpha Metallurgical Resources, Inc. (AMR), and CONSOL Energy Inc. (CEIX) to your portfolio, trading at discounted valuations.  Over the past year, the coal sector gained traction due to geopolitical tensions and unprecedented economic conditions. The Russian-Ukraine war and the subsequent response from the United States and its allies have had a crippling impact on energy resources, boosting the demand for pivotal commodities globally.  The global coal market grew from $614.96 billion in 2022 to $621.89 billion in 2023 at a CAGR of 1.1%. Furthermore, the coal market is expected to grow to $658.68 billion in 2027 at a CAGR of 1.4%.  Even though some countries have rolled out climate strategies to decarbonize their economies over the coming decades, with gas shortages and a long road ahead to meet global demand for renewable energy, many continue to rely on coal for power and industry.  While coal use is expected to decrease in the long term, demand is set to remain robust in 2023, and consumption is set to hit an all-time high. Emerging and developing economies in Asia are set to increase coal use to help power their economic growth, even as they add more renewables, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).  Furthermore, the market’s continued correction has led to many quality stocks trading at reasonable valuations. Given the fundamental strength, it could be wise to invest in BTU, AMR, and CEIX to gain from their explosive upside.

Two months after the disgraced Vanderpump Rules stars were caught for having a months-long affair by his (now former) girlfriend of nine years Ariana Madix, an insider has claimed that the duo has officially split.  “Raquel dipped out. Sandoval is not the one for her,” the source told Page Six.  The comment was a cheeky reference to Sandoval telling his fellow cast members that Leviss “dipped out” of his house during a recent Vanderpump Rules episode, causing confusion over whether or not she slept over. In case you missed it: she did.  And while performing a gig with his band Tom Sandoval and the Most Extras, he changed the lyrics to the iconic Fountains of Wayne song “Stacy’s Mom” to poke fun at Leviss, who is currently seeking treatment at a mental health facility.  Instead of singing, “Stacy can’t you see, you’re just not the girl for me,” the wannabe rockstar sang, “Schwartzy can’t you see, Raquel is not for me.”  Madix uncovered the affair in early March when she found a sexually explicit screen recording of Sandoval and her close friend on his phone. In a sneak peek for the show’s season finale — which airs tonight — the Something About Her owner reveals that Sandoval and Leviss first had sex in the former Sur waitress’s car shortly after Madix’s dog died.  Photo: Getty Images  “He didn’t have a key to get in so he had to ring the doorbell and I had to let him in,” Madix told her friends in the clip.  Despite Sandoval telling Howie Mandel that he and Leviss were “not putting any label” on their relationship, their co-stars seemed to believe that things were much more serious.  While Tom Schwartz found out about the one-night stand back in August 2022, it wasn’t until January 2023 that he said Sandoval admitted to being “in love” with Leviss.  “He’s addicted [to her],” Schwartz said during his off-the-walls Watch What Happens Live interview last month. “It’s an infatuation of all infatuations. Raquel is Tom’s heroin.”  Vanderpump Rules airs on Wednesday nights at 9/8c on Bravo.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vZGVjaWRlci5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8xNy90b20tc2FuZG92YWwtcmFxdWVsLWxldmlzcy1icmVhay11cC12YW5kZXJwdW1wLXJ1bGVzL9IBWGh0dHBzOi8vZGVjaWRlci5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8xNy90b20tc2FuZG92YWwtcmFxdWVsLWxldmlzcy1icmVhay11cC12YW5kZXJwdW1wLXJ1bGVzL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"explosion","2019-02-17","10:00:00","{""Kharkiv"", ""Harkov"", ""Ukraine""}","Wed 17 May 2023 09:08:10","The Russian invasion of Ukraine has put tremendous strain on the strategic partnership between South Africa and the United States. Since the invasion, the South African government has been unwilling to demand that Russia unilaterally put an end to hostilities and withdraw its forces from the sovereign territory of its neighbor.  This is despite the fact that South African foreign policy is supposed to be conducted in accordance with the values and principles set forth in the constitution. This includes the advancement of human rights and promotion of democracy.  The South African government has not appeared especially bothered by this apparent contradiction in their international relations. From its perspective, it has assumed a reasonable stance in a world characterized by an “unequal application” of Western principles in armed conflicts and other insecure environments. To be fair, South Africa is not alone. Just ask India and Vietnam.  The Russian invasion of Ukraine has exposed the practical limits of the strategic partnership between South Africa and the United States. Recent events suggest those limits include the provisioning of military products and services to the Russian government and Russian private military contractors.  Now, questions have been raised as to whether the South African government crossed that line and, if so, does that count as a redline in the strategic partnership for the US government. While the world awaits the answers, it is important for regional observers to reflect on the series of events that led to this historic low in relations between South Africa and the United States.  That requires a rapid tracing of the series of events that led to US Ambassador, Reuben Brigety, going out and leveling public accusations against the African National Congress and the South African government. When viewed in this context, it becomes clear that the ambassador’s remarks are effectively an acknowledgment of the structural instabilities that exist in the strategic partnership between South Africa and the United States.  The Ramaphosa administration and Biden administration will need to mitigate those instabilities with haste. Otherwise, the strategic partnership could very well collapse before next year’s national elections in both countries. That is the reality.  US Ambassador Reuben Brigety suspects South Africa is doing deals with Russia. Image: Twitter  Contentious context  Last March, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa insinuated that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) instigated the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In his words, the “war could have been avoided if NATO had heeded the warnings from amongst its own leaders and officials over the years that its eastward expansion would lead to greater, not less, instability in the region.”  For that reason, he indicated that South Africa would not take “a very adversarial stance against Russia.” In October, the South African government went further. It gave permission to dock to a Russian superyacht that was under Western sanctions. This was justified on the grounds that the South African government does not have a “legal obligation to abide by sanctions” that are imposed by Western governments.  Last December, a Russian cargo ship was dispatched to South Africa. In the vicinity of Naval Base Simon’s Town, its crew may have switched off its maritime tracking system. Soon, local residents observed the Western-sanctioned vessel docked at the largest base of the South African Navy. There, local residents reported materials being loaded and unloaded the ship “under the cover of darkness.”  When questioned, Defense Spokesperson Kobus Marais responded that, to the best of his knowledge, the ship had docked to offload “an old, outstanding order for ammunition.” According to Julius Malema of the Economic Freedom Fights, there was nothing inappropriate with such a transfer since it is “consistent with international best practice to honor contractual trade obligations and relationships.”  A few weeks later, the African National Congress hosted its 55th National Conference. There, the African National Congress openly criticized American foreign policy. In the Resolution on International Relations, the African National Congress observed that “US-led expansionist military strategies” had resulted in “Western imperialist dominance over Eastern Europe.”  As an anti-imperialist and anti-colonial party, the African National Congress not only decried “a conspicuous failure of the current global institutions to resolve conflicts fairly, justly and equitably in order to safeguard the interests of all nations.” It went further. It concluded that the Russia-Ukrainian War was “provoked” by an American government pursuing an imperialist agenda that was informed by the Wolfowitz Doctrine.  In February, Airports Company South Africa proposed structural changes to its fueling operations at its airports. These changes were designed to separate refueling operations from thru-putting to ensure that “a sanctioned friend of the South African government” would receive “servicing and refueling” as needed.  This division was intended to break forced alignment “with the stance the oil companies’ headquarters and home countries take in terms of sanctions against Russia.” Note, this move followed at least two earlier incidents where international oil companies had actually refused to refuel the Russian aircraft under Western sanctions that had been granted permission to land at commercial airports in South Africa.  These refusals had angered some members of parliament from the African National Congress who demanded public assurances that the state-owned airport management company would not “indirectly impose” Western sanctions on Russia. After those assurances were given, Air BP decided to cease all operations in South Africa.  Around the same time, the South African government hosted a major military exercise between China, Russia, and South Africa. Those exercises coincided with the one year anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. They also involved the Russian frigate Admiral Gorshkov, which was armed with Zircon hypersonic missiles.  Prior to the exercises, there was an official visit by Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, with the South African Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, Naledi Pandor. On the sidelines, Minister Pandor stressed that it would be “an abuse of international practice” to prevent the South African government from conducting ”military exercises with friends.” In the end, the US government expressed public concern about the exercises.  South African Minister of International Relations Naledi Pandor (right) and her Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov shake hands before talks in Pretoria on January 23, 2022. Image: Screengrab / NDTV  The US Embassy in South Africa cautioned that the exercises would not only present the South African government with a diplomatic challenge. It would lead South Africans to ask whether their country should be “associated with the symbol ‘Z’ painted on the side of the frigate the Admiral Gorshkov.”  In April, a Russian cargo plane owned by an American-sanctioned company was permitted to land at Waterkloof Air Force Base. The plane purportedly delivered diplomatic mail to the Russian embassy.  However, the company reportedly has “handled cargo shipments for sanctioned Russian Federation defense entities” in the past. A few weeks later, Assistant Secretary for Arms Control, Verification and Compliance Mallory Stewart was dispatched to South Africa and Egypt.  Note, Egypt is another country where suspicions have been raised about illicit weapons transfers to Russia. Between May 9-10, Assistant Secretary Stewart held talks with senior government officials at the Department of International Relations and Cooperation Republic of South Africa. Around the same time, the main opposition party, Democratic Alliance, issued a public statement chastizing the African National Congress for abusing Air Force Base Waterkloof and Naval Base Simonstown for their “narrow political interests.”  They also submitted a Promotion of Access to Information Act (PAIA) application requesting the disclosure of “who authorized the landing at Waterkloof and the docking at the naval base, including the type of goods that were brought in and out.”  Heated accusations  On May 11, bilateral relations finally boiled over. During a press briefing, US Ambassador Reuben declared that “the South African government is in fact not not aligned” with Russia. This led to a rapid deterioration in the strategic partnership between South Africa and the United States.  In his remarks, the ambassador went on to outline a series of accusations against the African National Congress. He observed that its senior leadership had published “outrageous” and “patently false” statements in the Resolution on International Relations that were openly “hostile” to the national security interests of the US government.  Moreover, he maintained that the African National Congress Headquarters, Luthuli House, had been unresponsive to his repeated attempts to open dialogue on these matters. To rub salt in the wound, Ambassador Reuben confirmed the existence of intelligence that showed that weapons and ammunition were loaded onto the Russian vessel at Naval Base Simon’s Town.  In his words, the US government was “confident that weapons were loaded into that vessel, and I would bet my life on the accuracy of that assertion.” He characterized such behavior by a strategic partner as “fundamentally unacceptable.”  The South African government was quick to respond to the allegations regarding the arms transfer at Naval Base Simon’s Town. The spokesperson to the President, Vincent Magwenya, claimed that the ambassador had undermined “the spirit of cooperation and partnership” that existed between the two countries in resolving the matter.  He noted that the South African government had launched “an independent inquiry” into the accusations made by the US government, and the two countries had agreed to allow that investigation “to run its course,” with the United States Intelligence Community providing supporting evidence.  For its part, the South African Department of Defense issued a statement in support of the independent investigation as it would provide “an opportunity to ventilate its side of the story with concrete evidence,” and thereby “deal with allegations surrounding the purpose of such a visit in front of a competent officer of the law instead of hearsay or speculation.”  Separately, the South African government issued a démarche to the ambassador through diplomatic channels. This led to the arrangement of a meeting between Ambassador Reuben and Foreign Minister Pandor. Following that meeting, the South African government reaffirmed that the National Conventional Arms Control Committee had never approved of a “sale of arms to Russia related to the period and incident in question.”  Noting that the independent inquiry would provide a “platform to establish facts and role players in the incident in question,” the South African government promised that anyone “found to have broken the law will face consequences.”  Moving forward, the South African government claimed that an agreement had been reached to “use established diplomatic channels to raise whatever issue may arise in the management of the bilateral relations between the two countries.”  For his part, Ambassador Reuben noted that the meeting had provided a platform to “correct any mis-impressions left by [his] public remarks.” Perhaps not surprisingly, he never provided clarification on what, if any, mis-impressions had arisen.  Acrimonious aftermath  This breakdown in bilateral relations brought about a wide array of secondary effects. One of the first dominos to fall was the South African economy.  Almost immediately, South African bond yields skyrocketed due to investor concerns quoted in Bloomberg that “a diplomatic row” between Pretoria and Washington could put “preferential trade access … worth billions of dollars to South Africa at risk.” In parallel, the South African rand fell “to the weakest level on record against the dollar.”  This was after the rand had recently fallen to a three-year low due to increasing fears “of scheduled blackouts known as loadshedding worsening during winter.” Investors were spooked. And, they seemed to have good reasons for it. The main opposition party pointed out that “close to 77% of foreign direct investment stock” of South Africa has come from the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States in recent years.  Domestic politics was another arm to cascade. In South Africa, Clement Manyathela cautioned his listeners that the South African government “has been cagey about this Russian vessel for so long – since its arrival and dawn departure. There has been no official explanation from the Department of Defense. No explanation from the South African National Defense Force. No explanation from the Navy either.  “This is despite a number of calls from politicians. Repeated media requests for information. So whatever information the government gives you now, take it with a pinch of salt. They were never interested in transparency from the word go. So anything is possible.”  With such doubts being expressed by the media a year out from a national election, it is not surprising that national politicians tried to capitalize on the controversy for political gain.  The strongest recriminations have been leveled by the Democratic Alliance. That party not only suggested that “President Ramaphosa and his government have already lied to South Africa and the world as to our country’s involvement in this devastating conflict.”  They said that it “signals” that South Africa has, under the leadership of the African National Congress, “regressed into a nation that has abandoned the principles of freedom, fairness, and equality.”  As the Shadow Minister for International Relations and Cooperation volleyed, the South African government is now “complicit in a war of aggression that … risks undermining both our domestic priorities and international peace and security.” ActionSA leadership expressed similar beliefs that the South African government has “never had a non-aligned approach to the Ukraine-Russian war.”  Rather than “supporting Russia during the ongoing war,” its politicians demanded that the South African government “come clean about … support for a dictatorial regime which is alleged to be actively funding” the African National Congress.  Russian President Putin and South African President Ramaphosa share a private word. Image: Facebook  The Economic Freedom Fighters have waged a radically different attack. Its leader, Julius Malema, argued that “American concerns are misplaced.” He claimed that the South African government “has got no capacity to empower Russians with weapons against their own handlers.”  Using inflammatory language, he went even further. He alleged that the US government “is just becoming a crybaby trying to find a way into punishing South Africa because of our position on the Russia-Ukraine war.”  The National Freedom Party charted a similar tack. Its leadership condemned the decision by the South African government “to establish a commission of inquiry into the alleged supply of weapons to Russia.”  In their words, the United States government has no “moral authority to make any demands or claims against the South African Government given the fact that it is the USA and its allies that are supplying arms and ammunition to the Ukrainians in this proxy war with Russia.”  In the United States, the harshest criticisms have been voiced by a Member of Congress from the Republican Party. After the news of the incident broke, the Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Jim Risch, publicly rebuked the South African government for its “anti-American screeds” and maltreatment of an American ambassador. As for the démarche, he added that such behavior “doesn’t reflect friendship or a neutral partner.”  Afterward, Ranking Member Risch extended a jab across the domestic political aisle when he publicly criticized the US government for failing to stand behind an American ambassador who “spoke honestly about an issue of grave concern to US national security.”  These words will resonate with other Members of Congress who have previously called on the US government to keep Congress better apprised of the strategic partnership by providing regular and comprehensive briefings on subjects relating to South Africa.

"explosion","2022-04-15","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 17:01:00","PRECIOUS METALS  Approximately 12 years ago, I wrote my first public market prognostication, and it was focused on gold, states Avi Gilburt of ElliotWaveTrader.net.  At the time, gold was enjoying a parabolic rally, and the discussion amongst the general public was how far past the $2,000 mark gold was going to strike during that rally.  So, on Aug. 11, 2011, I concluded my first gold article as follows:  ""Again, since we are most probably in the final stages of this parabolic fifth wave ""blow-off-top,"" I would seriously consider anything approaching the $1,915 level to be a potential target for a top at this time.""  Needless to say, my first market prognostication was not met with tremendous support. These are a sample of the comments I received from readers when I was calling for a metals market top:  ""With all due respect Avi, you plainly do not understand the gold market.""  ""Your TA is useless. You don't understand the fundamentals because you only look to the past. Gold bulls are forward-thinking. The times they are a changing...""  ""The problem is that TA is like driving a car by only looking in the rear-view mirror....There is no foresight involved; it's all based on past performance. The future of the fundamentals is what you fail to grasp.""  ""There is no way you can understand what is going on in gold by doing technical analysis. Gold is driven by fundamentals.""  ""Technical analyses is all well and good, but you cannot apply it to the PM sector which has been artificially manipulated and suppressed for years.""  Yet, as we now know, gold struck a top within $6 of the top for which I was calling.  What many may have seen as either ignorance or hubris, I even provided my downside target even before gold topped, wherein I explained my expectation for gold to drop back down to the $1,000 region.  ""Based upon the Elliott Wave Principle, I would expect a very large pullback. In fact, the target for such a pullback will probably be a minimum low of $1,400, it could fall as low as $1000, or even as low as $700. It will depend upon how the decline takes form. But those are very viable targets for gold on the downside.""  The comments regarding my views were basically the same as above, so, I will just note one of the more ""reasonable"" comments:  ""There is no way to rationalize $700 gold with 50% debasement of currency expected over the next five years as US debt grows to $21 trillion from $14. It makes no sense to my feeble mind. I vote for $3000 vs. $1900 today. That makes sense to my mind.""  As you can see, it was quite clear at the time that the ""fundamentals"" were keeping most metals bulls looking to the long side. And, amazingly, those same fundamentals kept the metals bulls looking to the long side of the market during the entire decline.  But what was truly amazing was that as gold was approaching its long-term low struck at the end of 2015, almost the entire market turned bearish and was again ""certain"" that it would continue in its downside trajectory (just as strongly as they were certain we would eclipse $2,000 in 2011), with most now turning from bullish to predicting a drop below $1,000.  Well, just like everyone was uber-bullish at the highs when we expected a major top, we turned bullish when everyone turned uber-bearish. On Dec. 30, 2015, I urged investors to be moving back into the metals complex as we were looking for a long-term bottom to be struck imminently due to the significant bearishness evident in the market:  ""As we move into 2016, I believe there is a greater than 80% probability that we finally see a long-term bottom formed in the metals and miners and the long-term bull market resumes. Those that followed our advice in 2011 and moved out of this market for the correction we expected, are now moving back into this market as we approach the long-term bottom. In 2011, before gold even topped, we set our ideal target for this correction in the $700-$1,000 region in gold. We are now reaching our ideal target region, and the pattern we have developed over the last four years is just about complete. [...] For those interested in my advice, I would highly suggest you start moving back into this market with your long-term money.""  In fact, back in September 2015, when the metals mining companies were absolutely hated by the investor community, I rolled out a service on ElliottWaveTrader specifically to focus on the mining industry. We began urging our clients to buy mining stocks during the last quarter of 2015. In fact, I bought stocks such as Newmont Mining (NEM) in the $15-17 region at the time. NEM was my largest holding in the complex since that time.  Now, fast forward to 2022, and gold had been stuck in a correction since a local top was struck back in August of 2020. Yet, there were pockets within the market that still rallied into 2022.  An example of such outperformance in 2022 included NEM, which went on to strike higher highs in April of 2022. Yet, when NEM struck the 84-85 region, I outlined to the members of Elliottwavetrader that, for the first time since I bought NEM in 2015, I was selling almost my entire holdings in the company. You see, I set a target of 82-89 when NEM was hovering in the 28 region. And, when we moved into my target region, I stuck with my plan and sold my largest holding in the complex. Since that time, NEM dropped 57% off its highs.  So, back in January, I provided you with my latest assessment of the gold market, with an expectation for gold to rally to the $2,428 region in this current move off the early November low. I also noted that we can certainly even blow through that, depending upon the extensions we see in the upcoming rally, but that target was a solid one for now. Clearly, I will re-assess the target once the next bullish phase begins in earnest.  And, then in April, I outlined my expectation for the metals market to begin its next rally to the $2,200+ region. My expectation was that a break-out through $2,075 would trigger that next bigger move. Yet, while the market spiked to $2,085 in early May, I warned the members of Elliottwavetrader that the structure of that move did not look like it was starting that rally to $2,200 just yet, and I expected more of a pullback. So, while the market did spike through $2,075, it clearly was not able to sustain that rally, as we expected, and it immediately spiked back down below.  At this time, I am still expecting a fast and strong rally to $2,200+ in the coming months. A breakout over $2,085 will likely now be the trigger.  Silver is providing us with a relatively low-risk buying opportunity, as it is set up to see a very strong upside follow-through when this pullback completes.  To keep it very simple, we have been outlining to the members of Elliottwavetrader our expectation for the pullback we are now seeing in silver, and it is now striking our general target region for this expected pullback. As long as silver holds over $22.50, I am expecting this pullback to complete over the coming week or two and set us up for a strong rally which should be pointing us north of 27 rather quickly.

Lynn Fire Chief Daniel Sullivan, Department of Conservation & Recreation Chief Fire Warden David Celino, and State Fire Marshal Peter Ostroskey said that about 400 acres of land had burned as a result of suspicious fires set over a period of several days.  “Any fire can present a hazard, but we saw rapid fire growth threatening numerous homes in our community as a result of these fires,” said Chief Sullivan. “Firefighters from Lynn and our mutual aid partners worked extraordinarily hard to bring them under control, and we’re extremely fortunate that we had no serious injuries or property damage.”  “Fires like these put people, property, and wildlife at risk,” said Chief Fire Warden Celino. “We’re experiencing Red Flag conditions across Massachusetts right now, with high winds, low humidity, and very dry fuel. Outdoor fires will burn rapidly, spread quickly, and produce dangerous fire behavior under these conditions. That puts an enormous strain on firefighters, their departments, and the communities they serve.”  Based on ongoing efforts by fire investigators from the Lynn Fire Department and the State Police Fire & Explosion Investigation Unit assigned to the State Fire Marshal’s office, officials believe that eight separate fires were intentionally set on May 12, May 13, and May 17. They are asking anyone with information on these incidents to share it with investigators.  Anyone who made observations in the area of the Lynn Woods Reservation on these dates or has other information on the fires can contact the State Police Fire & Explosion Investigation Unit at 978-567-3310 or the Arson Watch Reward Program at 1-800-682-9225. The Arson Watch Reward Program is overseen by the Massachusetts Property Insurance Underwriters Association and offers rewards of up to $5,000. Tipsters may remain anonymous if they wish.  “About 40% of Massachusetts home are in or near wildland areas,” said State Fire Marshal Ostroskey. “Setting a fire in this environment is a particularly dangerous act, especially under the current weather conditions.

According to the National Transportation Safety Board's preliminary report, it was a natural gas-fueled explosion and fire.  Council President Ryan Lineaweaver said the local disaster emergency declaration will continue to be extended until further notice, until everything is safe and sound.  ""Essentially, it allows us to continue to receive funding from outside sources,"" Lineaweaver said. ""It allows us to receive help from sources that we may not be able to if we don't have the emergency declaration extended.""  Lineaweaver said this is the third time the local disaster emergency declaration has been extended. It will run through the council meeting on June 20. Lineaweaver said it is mainly state assistance.  ""So, for instance, when we drew it up around midnight the day after Palmer happened,"" he explained, ""we ended up drawing it up, we sent it in to the county, and the next day we had access to [Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency].""  South Second Avenue remains blocked off where the explosion happened. Lineaweaver said it will be closed until further notice. He tells 69 News there will be some work going on at some of the buildings in the area.  ""They're currently working with Palmer for Building 1, to go in and retrieve items,"" Lineaweaver said.  He also said a waterproofing was put up on the north-facing wall that was removed.  ""There's a handful of things happening down there, slow and steady, but it's eventually turned back to both the companies and the business owners that own the buildings, as well as dealing with their insurance companies as well,"" Lineaweaver said.  The NTSB has yet to release a final report. According to the agency's initial report, the ongoing investigation will focus on a review of collected evidence, identifying the source of the explosion and related industry practices and federal regulations.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFodHRwczovL3d3dy53Zm16LmNvbS9uZXdzL2FyZWEvYmVya3Mvd2VzdC1yZWFkaW5nLWJvcm91Z2gtY291bmNpbC1leHRlbmRzLWxvY2FsLWRpc2FzdGVyLWVtZXJnZW5jeS1kZWNsYXJhdGlvbi9hcnRpY2xlXzMyZmFkMmYwLWY1MzktMTFlZC1iZDY5LWRmNDEyZDQ4NWJjYS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Douglas bats put that idea on ice in the second inning, when they brought 14 batters to the plate, hit three home runs, and scored nine runs. The Eagles then put it in cruise control, and sailed to a 10-1 win, and their third straight state final four appearance.  “I can’t say enough about our offensive approaches tonight,” said Douglas Manager Todd Fitz-Gerald. “We were locked in and stuck to the plan.”  The plan, it turns out, was similar to their regional semifinal game against Taravella, when the Eagles put up 10 runs in the first two innings. Douglas has now outscored their five playoff opponents by a combined 57-9.  Having a nine run lead in the second inning is insurmountable no matter when it happens. But when facing the most dominant pitcher of the past three seasons, Douglas’ ace Christian Rodriguez, the task becomes even more daunting.  Rodriguez threw six innings, limiting the Explorers hitters to just three hits and one run. He struck out four on the evening, before he gave way to Gavin Gargiulo, who closed out the regional final win with two strikeouts in the seventh.  The game served as the last one ever at home for Rodriguez, who has compiled a 12-0 record in 2023. Overall, Rodriguez is 30-1 in his high school career, with a 1.30 career ERA, to go along with 304 strikeouts in 183.2 innings.  “I couldn’t be happier for C-Rod, going out like he did in his final home game,” said Fitz-Gerald. “He has been such a special person in my life since he was seven years old. I’m like his second dad, and I love him immensely.”  With Rodriguez locking it down on the mound, the Eagles offensive explosion in the second came courtesy of some familiar names. Matt Ossenfort hit a double, and a home run in the inning. The homer was the third in two games for the senior first baseman. Ossenfort’s blast was followed by a Nico Benestad home run. Later in the inning, Alex Rodriguez connected for the third homer of the inning.  With the win, Douglas moves on to the 7A semifinals. Awaiting them will be Spruce Creek, with manager Matt Cleveland, a former longtime Broward County manager. The other semifinal will feature Plant, out of Tampa, and Park Vista, a team Douglas beat 8-2 earlier this season.  Douglas will be chasing history, with no public school team in Broward County history ever having an undefeated season. The Eagles sit at 27-0.  “I’m so happy for the boys and the coaches,” said Fitz-Gerald. “I want this for them, and couldn’t be more excited for this opportunity.”  To exemplify just how good Douglas has been this season, consider that they have only trailed for a total of five innings the entire season, and all five innings, they only trailed 1-0.  Furthermore, the Eagles have faced a whopping 16 teams that are ranked in the Top 10 of their sites HSBN Power Rankings. The total score combined in those 16 wins is 120-21. Two of those teams are defending state champions, and are heading back to states this year (Doral, North Broward Prep).

"explosion","2023-02-26","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 14:31:30","The market for stolen data logs is booming and information stealing malware is becoming “a natural choice” for cybercriminals seeking a quick way to infiltrate businesses, according to new research from Secureworks.  Infostealers pilfer login credentials, financial details, and personal data from infected computers and networks, and a report published Tuesday by the vendor’s Counter Threat Unit claims the tools are becoming more sophisticated and harder to detect, posing a growing challenge for defenders of corporate networks.  Threat groups package and sell the exfiltrated data as logs which can be used to break into enterprise networks via remote access services, like virtual private networks (VPNs) and Microsoft Office Web Access (OWA).  Secureworks research found that since June 2021, the number of logs for sale on Russian Market – the largest dark web market for infostealer logs, - was up 670%. It grew by 150% from June 2022, when there were 2 million logs for sale on a single day, to 5 million in late February 2023.  “Coordinated global action by law enforcement is having some impact, but cybercriminals are adept at reshaping their routes to market,” said Don Smith, vice president for threat research at SecureWorks.  Despite multiple arrests and the takedown of 11 domains associated with Genesis Market last month, the Tor site remained operational with logs still available for sale. Activity had slowed, however, and criminals had been observed on underground forums discussing their concerns about using the market.  Telegram has been a beneficiary of this, with more buying and selling of logs for popular stealers such as RedLine, Anubis, SpiderMan and Oski Stealer shifting to dedicated Telegram channels, Secureworks found.  The malware is also becoming cheaper and easier for relatively inexperienced cybercriminals to use, and the popularity of working from home and bring your own device (BYOD) policies have led to a surge in opportunities for corporate assets to be infected by personal devices. Many underground forums sell the tool as part of a monthly subscription package for prices that range between $50 and $1,000 per month.  “Infostealers are a natural choice for cybercriminals who are looking to rapidly gain access to businesses and then monetize that access,” said Smith. “They are readily available for purchase, and within as little as 60 seconds generate an immediate result in the form of stolen credentials and other sensitive information.”  Smith said the innovative ways criminals were finding to trick users into installing the malware, such as via fake messaging apps and cloned websites, “has really changed the game.”  Secureworks said the growing popularity of malware-as-a-service within the criminal underworld had sparked innovation among developers to improve their products and appeal to a wider range of customers.  For example, Russian Market started offering users the option to pre-order stolen credentials for a specific organization, business, or application. While there were no guarantees pre-orders would be fulfilled, buyers who deposited $1,000 into the site’s escrow system could request credentials based on a specified domain name.  The SecureWorks report claims the use of infostealers is now so widespread, an entire secondary market has popped up for individuals who can parse raw log data into common or usable formats for a fee.  “What we are seeing is an entire underground economy and supporting infrastructure built around infostealers, making it not only possible but also potentially lucrative for relatively low-skilled threat actors to get involved,” Smith said.  Because of their ability to discreetly and efficiently exfiltrate sensitive data from targeted systems, the tools are also popular with state-sponsored threat groups that focused on cyberespionage operations.  During the war in Ukraine, Russian threat actors had deployed the Graphiron infostealer to target Ukrainian organizations. Chinese state-sponsored threat groups had also been observed using infostealers.  Smith said there were a range of measures organizations could take to reduce the risk of data theft.  “Ensuring that you implement multi-factor authentication to minimize the damage caused by the theft of credentials, being careful about who can install third-party software and where it is downloaded from, and implementing comprehensive monitoring across host, network and cloud are all key aspects of a successful defense against the threat of infostealers.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbWFnYXppbmUuY29tL25ld3MvdGhyZWF0LWludGVsbGlnZW5jZS9kYXRhLWxvZy10aGVmdHMtZXhwbG9kZS1hcy1pbmZvc3RlYWxlcnMtZ2Fpbi1wb3B1bGFyaXR5LXdpdGgtY3liZXJjcmltaW5hbHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"explosion","2023-12-15","Not Discerned","{""Dallas"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 23:34:05","Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Michael Gallup is ready to get his NFL career back on track. Dallas' third-round pick in the 2018 NFL Draft burst onto the scene with career-highs in receptions (66), receiving yards (1,107) and receiving touchdowns (six) at 23 years old in 2019. Then a gruesome, season-ending ankle injury to quarterback Dak Prescott hampered his development in 2020, and a season-ending torn ACL in Week 17 of the 2021 season against the Arizona Cardinals set him back much further.  The effects from coming back from the severe knee injury showed externally on the field -- Gallup totaled a career-low 424 receiving yards last season -- but he was also dealing with the mental hurdle of trusting his movements, which was nearly as big of an issue.  ""I was thinking too much [last season],"" Gallup said Wednesday, via The Athletic. ""My knee was feeling sore and it was just different. I never really had it like that last year.""  A little more than 16 months removed from suffering the injury, Gallup is in a completely different place and confident he can return to form. Dallas is banking on it considering it signed him to a five-year, $57.5 million deal in the 2022 offseason, shortly after the injury.  ""It's different,"" Gallup said when asked about his knee now. ""I feel springy again.""  Michael Gallup DAL • WR • #13 TAR 74 REC 39 REC YDs 424 REC TD 4 FL 0 View Profile  The 2023 season will also be different for Gallup because he will be returning to the role he thrived in, as the team's third receiver, when he and quarterback Dak Prescott were last both healthy for an entire season and four-time Pro Bowl wideout Amari Cooper was on the roster. Once again, Dallas has two high-caliber pass-catchers in front of him in 2022 second-team All-Pro CeeDee Lamb and offseason trade acquisition Brandin Cooks.  The Silver and Blue acquired the soon-to-be 30-year-old in March from the Houston Texans in exchange for a 2023 fifth-round pick and a 2024 sixth-round pick. The Cowboys then promptly signed him to a two-year, $20 million extension that locks him in with the team through the 2024 season.  Getting Cooks was a big deal. Since 2014 when he entered the league, he's one of seven players with more than 8,500 receiving yards (8,616) and 45 receiving touchdowns (49). Alongside Cooks in that exclusive club is Davante Adams, Mike Evans, DeAndre Hopkins, Travis Kelce, Stefon Diggs and Antonio Brown.  Cooks' six career seasons of at least 1,000 receiving yards are tied for the third-most in the NFL since 2014, trailing only Evans (nine) and Kelce (seven). He has achieved the feat with each of his four previous teams: the New Orleans Saints (2015-16), New England Patriots (2017), Los Angeles Rams (2018) and Texans (2020-21). Doing so in 2021 with Houston is especially noteworthy given he was catching passes from 32-year-old Tyrod Taylor and rookie Davis Mills. Gallup could hardly contain his excitement when talking about being able to start alongside him.  ""Oh man, Brandin Cooks, I'm talking about a 10-year vet that has [six] seasons over 1,000 yards,"" Gallup said. ""He's just bringing knowledge to the whole group, and we love him in [the wide receivers room]. I ain't going to lie to you. He has been in there every day, working, just trying to win. That's all he wants to do is just win, and he wants to do it as a group. He's a great addition.""  Brandin Cooks DAL • WR • #3 TAR 93 REC 57 REC YDs 699 REC TD 3 FL 0 View Profile  The most significant pearls of wisdom Cooks has imparted on Dallas' young pass-catchers have been about the keys to extending their careers: taking care of their bodies.  ""Getting your body right. That's all he keeps preaching. He talks to everybody, 'When you are done with this, you're done with that, make sure you stretch. Make sure you do what you're supposed to do so you can stay in the league as long as you possibly can.' That's one of the biggest things right now. Football, that's going to be there. We got in the league for a reason, but he's over here talking about how you stay in the league. That's the knowledge he's bringing.""  Alongside Lamb and Cooks, Gallup and his healthy knees are finally ready to turn the clock back to 2019.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNzcG9ydHMuY29tL25mbC9uZXdzL2Nvd2JveXMtbWljaGFlbC1nYWxsdXAtZmVlbHMtc3ByaW5neS1hZ2Fpbi1yZWFkeS10by1yZXR1cm4tdG8tMjAxOS1mb3JtLXdpdGgtYW5vdGhlci1leHBsb3NpdmUtd3ItdHJpby_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"explosion","2023-05-17","Not Discerned","{""Madras"", ""TamilNadu"", ""India""}","Wed 17 May 2023 18:02:00","For foreign audiences, Indian cinema long has been closely associated with Bollywood — sprawling, colorful spectacles that feature songs and dance routines — and often one of the three Khans (the unrelated trio of Aamir, Salman and Shah Rukh). But there has been a shift across the past year as focus turned from Mumbai, which had suffered a string of misses until Shah Rukh Khan’s Pathaan took off on a tear early this year, toward Southern India.  The Indian film industry is one of the world’s most prolific, but it somehow feels like a switch has been flipped with interest from non-diaspora audiences. In part, that’s down to S.S. Rajamouli and his Telugu-language pic RRR, which became a phenomenon unto its own with worldwide box office appeal and awards recognition from myriad bodies including the Academy, which made “Naatu Naatu” the first song from an Indian movie to win an Oscar.  Rajamouli already had made waves globally with his two-part Baahubali franchise. But RRR put Telugu titles into the mainstream outside India, arguably fueling growth in so-called pan-India movies. RRR’s N.T. Rama Rao Jr. (NTR) recently was set to star with Hrithik Roshan in War 2, which, along with Pathaan, forms part of Yash Raj Films’ Spy Universe. The crossover could give War 2 wider audience appeal.  RELATED: Cannes Film Festival Photo Gallery Of Premieres & Parties  India, a multilingual and multi-ethnic country, consists of several different industries corresponding to different states, such as Bollywood (Hindi cinema), Tollywood (Telugu cinema) and Kollywood (Tamil cinema).  (L-R) Scarlett Mellish Wilson, Prabhas, Nora Fatehi and Sneha Upadhyay in ‘Baahubali: The Beginning’ Birch Tree Entertainment/Everett Collection  Given that Hindi is understood in almost three-quarters of India, Bollywood historically was the dominant player. As box office analyst Jatinder Singh says, “Due to the language barrier, the industries like Tollywood and Kollywood remained regional players, catering only to their state primarily.” That was until South Indian films began getting dubbed into Hindi — mostly for TV but also coinciding with the emergence of multiplexes in India, especially in the north. The multiplexes and their higher ticket prices, Singh says, “started making cinemagoing an elitist activity, and Bollywood started to cater to these multiplex audiences, cutting down on larger-than-life commercial masala films.” In turn, South Indian films dubbed into Hindi began to dominate television, too, as they provided what Bollywood was not delivering.  RELATED: Cannes Film Festival Full Coverage  Then, in a watershed moment in 2015, a Hindi version of Rajamouli’s Baahubali: The Beginning was released theatrically and became a huge breakout success. In 2017, the sequel followed suit. As the audience expanded for South Indian films, so did budgets and production values.  Says Sri Harsha Chundru, co-founder of Walls & Trends, which marketed RRR and regularly works with major titles: “Telugu cinema has proved that language does not matter. A good and emotional story can transcend linguistic and socio-cultural barriers. Also, we are one of the few industries that managed to strike a balance between commercial or colloquially speaking ‘mass’ elements and a larger-than-life message or any other inspiring and message-oriented takeaways. I think RRR and other unapologetic entertainers, so to speak, have paved the way for mainstream commercial cinema and inspired other filmmakers to dream big.”  He calls Telugu cinema “a melting pot of culture,” suggesting that audiences can expect “many more multi-starrer films featuring actors from different industries across India, if not the world.” Whatever comes next, it will be, “bigger, better and bolder.”  RELATED: Cannes Palme d’Or Winners Through The Years: Photo Gallery  But Chundru also predicts: “While the quality of VFX and graphics are likely to exponentially improve, there will be a rise in small-budget films as well. Large-scale Telugu films put Telugu cinema as a whole in the limelight, so audiences across the world would be eager to explore more of Telugu cinema in all its shapes and forms.”  Actress Pooja Hegde, who has appeared in Telugu, Tamil and Hindi films, says that while the perception from outside of India is that Telugu cinema has only just emerged in the past year, this is not the case. It has been “years of audience building, hard work, and love. And when the dubbed versions were released simultaneously with the original language version in the theaters, the payoff has been huge. It is encouraging that the West is beginning to understand that India is a very culturally diverse country and that there is more to it than just Hindi films. There is a lot of talent in India and film industries from across the states are producing exceptional films, be it through its storytelling or technical skills.”  Allu Arjun in ‘Pushpa: The Rise Part 01’ Classics Entertainment/Everett Collection  Says Singh, “2022 felt like it was the year when the result of this was on full display as multiple South Indian Hindidubbed films found success.” Those also include Pushpa: The Rise — Part 01, Kantara, Karthikeya 2, Vikram and Ponniyin Selvan: Part I.  Anticipation ahead is high for upcoming Tollywood titles including Ram Charan’s Game Changer, NTR’s next untitled pic and Hombale Films’ Telugu-language action thriller Salaar, starring Prabhas, who also features in Yash Raj’s Project K with Deepika Padukone and Amitabh Bachchan for release in early 2024. Hombale, which released Prashanth Neel’s Yash-starring Kannada-language smash KGF: Chapter 2, also is working on Kannada-language Kantara 2, directed by and starring Rishab Shetty. It’s part of an ambitious slate across four South Indian languages from the studio, which recently pledged to invest $370 million in films and series over the next five years.  RELATED: India Recorded Second-Biggest Box Office Year Ever In 2022 With $1.28B, But Admissions Still Down On Pre-Pandemic Levels  “There is a great exchange of culture that is happening right now,” RRR star Charan says. “The boundaries are becoming seamless and blurred, and I think it’s important that my nation calls themselves the Indian film industry rather than sectioning ourselves into different industries. … I’m happy that I’m in an era where this change is happening. It’s good to be part of the global film industry now.”  Dylan Marchetti of Variance Films, who, alongside Potentate Films, Sarigama Cinemas and Raftar Creations, released RRR in the U.S. and led the Academy push, said recently that RRR could be a “gateway drug,” adding: “There are a lot of people — programmers, bookers, industry people — who were only peripherally aware of Telegu/South Indian cinema. There will be more films like this that can cross over.”  Read the digital edition of Deadline’s Disruptors/Cannes magazine here  Today he remains bullish. “There’s always going to be an audience of film lovers that, if it’s good, they’ll find it. I’m interested in developing the secondary Western audience that needs to be marketed to. That audience, as it grows, will have offshoots leaning more toward action or the fantastical. You need to have a steady supply and marketing in conjunction with the global release. I think there’s a hunger now.”  Variance is looking for the next title to bring to U.S. cinemas. “We are doing our part to put the best of the best in front of the audience,” Marchetti says. “There is a curiosity — once you’ve seen something you’ve never seen before, you want to see more. My hope is that it continues to advance people’s minds.” He points to examples like 2000’s Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, which spurred folks to dig more into martial arts movies, or the success of Parasite, which turned them on to Korean cinema.  Rajamouli has said previously that the success of RRR and the rise of Telugu cinema is “really important” to him. “Because now I can expand even more,” he explained. “More and more films are going to come and cross these language barriers and tap into people across larger areas. Hopefully, we grow beyond, not just in the country, but into other countries, cultures and languages as well.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvcnJyLXNvdXRoLWluZGlhbi1maWxtLWV4cGFuc2lvbi1wYXRoYWFuLXNoYWgtcnVraC1rYWhuLXNzLXJhamFtb3VsaS0xMjM1MzYyODU4L9IBcGh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvcnJyLXNvdXRoLWluZGlhbi1maWxtLWV4cGFuc2lvbi1wYXRoYWFuLXNoYWgtcnVraC1rYWhuLXNzLXJhamFtb3VsaS0xMjM1MzYyODU4L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"explosion","2022-07-25","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 14:49:27","    The “grave dangers” of atypical myopathy have been highlighted as a bumper crop of seeds last autumn means an “explosion” in seedling growth – and more cases of the potentially fatal disease.  Atypical myopathy – a condition that weakens a horse’s muscles – can occur when toxin hypoglycin A, found in sycamore seeds, is ingested. It is thought the hot summer of 2022 had contributed to greater-than-normal production of the seeds, and a rise in cases of the condition.  The British Equine Veterinary Association (BEVA) said the huge number of toxic seeds are now sprouting in numerous places, including pastures and hay fields, “causing an alarming second rise in cases of atypical myopathy”.  Vet Phil Cramp lost his 13-year-old “gentle giant” Dermot to the condition last month.  “We’d been on a fun ride; he had a great time and was happy,” Mr Cramp told H&H. “But when we got home, he was quivering, he wasn’t right. We thought he’d tied up and treated him but he got rapidly worse.”  Mr Cramp took Dermot to his practice, where blood tests confirmed atypical myopathy and despite the vets’ best efforts, he had to be put down. Mr Cramp said the toxin is water-soluble, so the standing water from this wet spring has exacerbated the situation to a “perfect storm”. He added that the other horses kept in the same field were tested and had levels of the toxin but did not become ill.  “That tells us that some are susceptible and some aren’t,” he said. “They have to convert the toxin and none of them had done that.”  Mr Cramp advises spraying fields, and blood-testing horses who may have ingested seeds or seedlings.  “If the horse has the toxin, it needs to come out of the field, and be rested,” he said. “Exercise brings out the disease as the toxin inhibits ATP, the cells’ fuel, so the muscles run out of energy. There are things you can do to reduce the impact but rest is very important.”  Horse owner Amelia Shaw has started a petition calling for landowners to have an automatic right to fell sycamore trees on their land even if restrictions related to conservation areas or tree protection orders (TPO) apply.  Sign the petition  She told H&H she did get permission to fell a sycamore that was subject to a TPO on her land in 2016, but “it was a bit of a nightmare”.  “The whole process was difficult,” she said. “We were refused by the council but won on appeal. I was still at university so had time to do it but the condition is so prevalent this year and I’ve heard lots of people saying they want to fell trees but they’re protected. So I wanted to raise awareness, and also see if I could get support. It’s absolutely awful this year, we’ll be lucky if there are any horses left.”  BEVA is urging farmers cutting fields for hay to identify those at risk; not just those with sycamores nearby as the seeds can travel hundreds of metres, and avoid selling this hay to horse owners.  President David Rendle said: “By raising awareness of the risks of contaminated hay being fed to horses BEVA is hoping farmers will be able to identify any sycamore saplings within the crop while the grass length enables them to be seen. Sheep and cattle can also be affected by the toxin at very high levels but ruminants are more resistant to the toxin than horses. We are urging farmers to check their fields now and to discuss the risks from sycamores with their local equine veterinary practice if they need any further advice.”  You might also be interested in:  Horse & Hound magazine, out every Thursday, is packed with all the latest news and reports, as well as interviews, specials, nostalgia, vet and training advice.

"explosion","2023-01-01","Not Discerned","{""GreenBay"", ""Wisconsin"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 21:00:43","The Packers could have 'one of most explosive offenses in NFL' very soon, one NFL analyst says  Can the Green Bay Packers return to being one of the best offenses in the NFL with Jordan Love at quarterback and a young wide receiving cast?  One NFL analyst believes so.  ""Over the next season and over the next couple of years, this could be one of the most explosive offenses in the NFL and I think it has unlimited upside,"" Louis Riddick said during a recent appearance on ESPN's ""NFL Live.""  It's only been three years since the Packers had the No. 1-ranked scoring offense in the league and, with Aaron Rodgers at quarterback, they had a top-10 offense in 10 of the last 15 seasons.  Three years later, nearly everything has changed.  Love will be the quarterback. The wide receiver room has completely turned over with all first and second-year players led by Christian Watson and Romeo Doubs teaming with rookies Jayden Reed and Dontayvion Wicks. And the tight end position will be anchored by rookies Luke Musgrave and Tucker Kraft.  ""You have to take it slow and be willing to live with the bumps in the road,"" said Riddick, a former NFL player, scout and member of two front offices. ""You have to give them some time.""  What is a successful season for Jordan Love and the Packers in 2023?  Riddick's fellow panelist, Keyshawn Johnson, a former NFL wide receiver, gave a simple response when asked how success will be defined for Love in Year 1 as the starter.  ""Well, don't screw it up,"" Johnson said bluntly.  Johnson added that if Love can get the Packers to the eight-win mark — the Packers' total last season — or a little better, and show Packers management that he has improved, it'll be a successful season. Of note, the Packers' offense in 2022 with Rodgers playing every game dropped out of the top 10 in scoring, ranking 14th and their 21.8 points average was 10 points fewer than their league-high 2020 season. And in Rodgers' first season as the starter in 2008 the Packers finished 6-10 a year after going 13-3.  ""Show us that you've evolved since sitting on the bench,"" Johnson said. ""Show us what the Green Bay Packers saw in practice and what little bit of game play that you've had, that you've learned from it, that you've gotten better. I think he'll be successful. I understand he can't be Aaron Rodgers off the bat.""  Riddick explained the Packers should lean on what he called one of the best offensive lines and running back tandems in the NFL. Even so, managing expectations will be critical for Matt LaFleur and his coaching staff with so much inexperience across the offense.  Christian Watson, who is entering his second season, will lead a young Green Bay Packers wide receiving room in 2023.  Do the Packers need to sign a veteran wide receiver?  So, given the lack of NFL experience of the receivers, should the Packers add a veteran wideout? Johnson doesn't view that as a necessity.  ""I think you can expect them to be the core,"" he said. ""As long as you have a veteran wide receiver coach and a veteran offensive playcaller, they'll be fine.""  Jason Vrable enters his fifth season with the Packers and second as the wide receivers/passing game coordinator. He served as the wide receivers coach for two years before that and was an offensive assistant for one season. He came to the Packers with six years of NFL coaching experience.  Adam Stenavich is in his second year as offensive coordinator but LaFleur is the playcaller.  ""A lot of people look at it the wrong way,"" Johnson said of needing veterans. ""I understand it was Aaron Rodgers and there were high hopes in Green Bay. But you have to give them the opportunity and chance.""

Moments later, Kaiser’s daughter pulled over, and she and her sister noticed smoke coming out of the vents.  “It was just minutes of getting out of the car that it was engulfed in flames,” Kaiser said.  Kim Kaiser's two teenager daughters were in the car when the car began to cease accelerating. Moments later, it caught on fire.

Willis was also driving on Briley Parkway on Dec. 29, 2022, when he too had to pull over. “I kind of noticed the car wasn’t accelerating like it normally would,” Willis said.  As he pulled over and tried to restart the car, Willis said a woman drove in front of him and yelled for him to exit the car, as flames were underneath.  In a video he recorded moments later, Willis can be heard screaming, asking why the car was on fire. He then called his fiancé, Kanesha Horsley.  “He’s like, I don’t know, I can’t explain it.

Its driver recorded as firefighters showed up to extinguish the flames.  WSMV4 Investigates has now documented five instances in which drivers were behind the wheel and their KIA vehicles caught on fire.  To further complicate the problem, in certain years, KIA Souls and Sorentos were recalled for the potential of a car fire.  But in each of the five cases documented by WSMV4 Investigates, the vin numbers on these specific cars were not identified as being part of a recall.  In fact, Horsley said she got a recall in the mail for all KIA Souls of her year and make, took it into a dealership, only to be told that her vin number indicated that it wasn’t part of the recall. “I was just thinking, I can keep driving it, it’s fine,” Horsley said.  Insurance claim data shows more fires in other vehicles  A review of insurance claim data shows a wide swath of vehicles currently not under recall still catching fire.  The data is only for claims about vehicles that caught on fire but were not involved in accidents, like the KIA vehicles documented by WSMV4 Investigates.  The data, at a cursory level, shows the models, makes and years of the vehicles with the highest rates of non-crash fires.  There are so many cases of fires in other makes and models, the KIA Soul and Sorento don’t even make the top ten.  Matt Moore, senior vice president of the Highway Loss Data Institute, said the data is presented to NHTSA for their review in determining recalls.  “It’s difficult to know if these fires were the result of a defect or something that happened over the life of the vehicle,” Moore said.  The data shows, overwhelmingly, the claims on non-crash car fires happen in older vehicles.  “Is that the reality? That an older car is more likely to catch on fire?” WSMV4 Investigates asked.  “That’s the reality. It’s not likely to catch on fire. It’s more likely to catch on fire than a new vehicle,” Moore said.  Once again, WSMV4 Investigates reached out to KIA Corporate for an explanation of why the vehicles now showing as part of the fire recall are still catching on fire, but a spokesman just asked for the vin numbers of the vehicles to investigate further.  The spokesman did write that there are many potential causes of vehicle fires, so these investigations on the vehicles are important to begin.  “When my children see them going down the road in the cars, we want to stop them and say, sell your car, get a different car,” Kaiser said.

"explosion","2023-10-17","Not Discerned","{""WestPalmBeach"", ""Florida"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 17:30:25","Bad news, space explosion fans: Betelgeuse is behaving strangely again, but it’s probably not about to explode.  Betelgeuse, the red giant best known for its starring role as the right shoulder of the constellation Orion, has brightened dramatically over the past few weeks. The star is about 50 percent brighter than usual, which has fueled a fresh wave of rumors that Betelgeuse might be on the brink of a supernova.  But astrophysicist Andrea Dupree says we shouldn’t worry — or get our hopes up. Instead, this latest strangeness from Betelgeuse is actually a sign that the star is getting back to normal.  “The star WILL go supernova,” Dupree tells Inverse, “but not in our lifetimes.”  “Where’s the Kaboom?”  This image tracks the Surface Mass Ejection that caused Betelgeuse’s infamous Great Dimming. NASA  At the moment, nuclear reactions deep in Betelgeuse’s core are busily smashing helium atoms together to form carbon atoms. When the star runs out of helium, a new set of reactions will start fusing carbon into oxygen.  Only after all the oxygen has become silicon, and all the silicon has become iron, will Betelgeuse finally run out of fuel to power the nuclear reactions that keep the star inflated against the tremendous force of its own gravity. At that point, it will collapse under its own gargantuan mass, triggering one of the most powerful explosions in the universe: a supernova.  Astronomers and skywatchers have been keeping a close eye on Betelgeuse since 2019, when its usual reddish glow faded dramatically. The Great Dimming, as it came to be called, continued through 2020 — and so did the supernova speculation. Dupree and her colleagues concluded that the dimming was part of the giant star’s normal restless activity.  Essentially, Betelgeuse belched out a cloud of gas and dust into space from an inner layer called the photosphere, which left a cool, dark patch on its southern hemisphere (which happens to be the hemisphere that’s facing Earth). Our own Sun does something similar, called a coronal mass ejection, fairly often; the only difference is that Betelgeuse’s ejection came from deeper inside the star.  Betelgeuse has always been prone to fluctuations; ancient historical records and oral histories say the star brightened and dimmed on a regular cycle, and that's continued through modern times. That cycle has been a fairly regular 420 days — up until the Great Dimming. Since then, Betelgeuse has been erratic at best. Betelgeuse’s recent brightening may be part of the star’s attempt to regain its equilibrium after its great stellar burp.  “The surface and interior of the star are trying to get back to normal after the substantial Surface Mass Ejection,” says Dupree. “Think of it as like your washing machine going off on ‘imbalance’ and sloshing around trying to get back to 'normal.’”  In other words, we can probably expect to see a few more rounds of sudden brightening and dimming from Betelgeuse before it settles back into more predictable behavior.  “Our theoretical calculations suggest that the 400-day period should return in a year or two, but Betelgeuse may surprise us,” Dupree says.  Apocalypse When?  But the real surprise would be if Betelgeuse actually went supernova within our lifetimes — or the lifetimes of the next several generations of humans. If Betelgeuse, or another red giant star, really is about to explode, it will give us some warning in the form of drastic changes that will make the Great Dimming look like nothing but a brief flicker. The star should darken abruptly, getting about 100 times dimmer in a matter of weeks or months, as it shrugs off its outer layers entirely.  When the big moment finally comes, Betelgeuse will abruptly transform from a very recognizable bright red star in the constellation Orion to a blaze of light about half as bright as a full Moon, visible even in the daytime. As the star is 650 light years away, future Earthlings will be able to observe the supernova from a safe distance, but close enough for astronomers to gather incredible data on the death of a giant star. It will be a once-in-several-thousand-lifetimes astronomical event.  Betelgeuse will get there eventually. Just give it 10,000 years or so.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVyc2UuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYmV0ZWxnZXVzZS1pcy10YXVudGluZy11cy1hZ2Fpbi1idXQtc3RpbGwtbm90LWV4cGxvZGluZ9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Regulators have closed their investigation into these explosions, but people who have experienced this told Channel 2 consumer investigator Justin Gray that it sounds and feels like an explosion in their vehicles.  Auto safety advocates say that really puts drivers at risk of an accident.  Kate Holder said she had to pull over after hearing what she can only describe as an explosion while driving her brand-new Jeep Wagoneer to work.  “I was going 55 miles an hour, then all of a sudden, like, literally an explosion,” Holder said.  [HAVE A STORY FOR 2 INVESTIGATES?: Submit your tip here]  Then she got out of the car.  “I just stood up on the rail. Got up and saw the big hole,” Holder said.  “Truly spontaneous?” Gray asked Holder.  “Yes, the most bizarre thing ever,” she said.  But when Channel 2 Action News checked with federal regulators, we found spontaneous breakage of panoramic sunroofs have been happening with a variety of makes and model vehicles for years.  So much so that The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration launched a 7-year investigation finding, “spontaneous sunroof glass shattering is not an uncommon occurrence: More than 4,000 complaints of such occurrences were reported by the 13 manufacturers”  MORE STORIES FROM 2 INVESTIGATES:  Gray checked the NHTSA complaint database as recently as last week.  The driver of a Ford Edge wrote, “I was driving down the road when out of nowhere my sunroof started raining glass in the inside of my car!! There was no Crack or stone that hit it nothing!!”  “That type of distraction while you’re driving, you know, you’ve got tempered glass chunks all over you and you don’t know what just happened. I think any reasonable person can see that that could pose a pretty serious distraction risk,” said Michael Brooks, executive director of The Center for Auto Safety.  But in 2021, NHTSA closed its investigation into panoramic sunroofs without ever determining what’s causing them to spontaneously explode, writing it “has not identified sufficient evidence of a safety-related defect in the subject sunroof.”  “What if the glass got into my baby’s eyes, or face, or even the car seat?” Holder asked.  She told Gray that she’s just thankful she had the cover closed on the sunroof.  “Now, I don’t want to open up the sunroof … just in case,” Holder said.  NHTSA said there have been about a dozen reported minor injuries, most from cleaning up the glass.  Gray checked with NHTSA before his report on Wednesday to see if there have been any updates. A spokesman told said there is no current investigation into the sunroofs.

"explosion","2023-12-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 14:16:20","Amazon 's Alexa head said his company is right in the middle of the boom in generative artificial intelligence, the technology that's spreading rapidly across Silicon Valley and has spurred an arms race between Microsoft and Google .  The tech world has been enamored with a new generation of chatbots since OpenAI's ChatGPT went viral late last year. That's pressured companies like Amazon to showcase their own capabilities in generative AI. Amazon's biggest entry into the market thus far has been through an AI service for cloud customers.  However, Rohit Prasad, Amazon's senior vice president and head scientist for Alexa, said it's wrong to think the e-retailer has missed out in generative AI, which allows people to convert text-based queries into creative and thorough answers.  ""Alexa has been and is at the forefront of AI for a long time,"" Prasad told CNBC in an interview. ""We've been part of the cultural zeitgeist and it hasn't slowed down.""  Prasad added that contrary to ChatGPT, which remains accessible through a web browser, Alexa is an ""instantly available, personal AI"" that people can communicate with by voice.  Amazon established an early lead in voice software after it debuted its Alexa digital assistant in 2014. More than 500 million Alexa-powered devices have been sold worldwide, the company said Wednesday. The last time Amazon gave an update on that number was in 2019, when it was at 100 million.  The Alexa assistant, now plugged into everything from smart speakers to thermostats, has long depended on machine learning technology to answer their queries by fetching relevant data.  But the rise of AI-powered chatbots, which can perform sophisticated functions like writing fiction and coding software, has highlighted the limitations of digital assistants such as Alexa. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' sci-fi vision for Alexa to resemble an all-knowing computer from ""Star Trek"" hasn't exactly panned out.  Prasad said Amazon is working to make Alexa more conversational and intelligent. One way it hopes to do so is through a new version of its own large language model, called Alexa Teacher Model. Large language models power generative AI, and Alexa is already powered by Amazon's LLM.  The goal is for Alexa to be able to answer complex requests, and understand more about users.  ""This is where all the ambient context of who you are, what are you asking, where you are, comes in to make the best decision for you in that moment and on your behalf,"" Prasad said.  In his latest letter to investors, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said generative AI and LLMs are areas where the company is ""investing heavily,"" noting that the technologies stand to ""transform and improve virtually every customer experience.""  The company has posted job listings suggesting it plans to implement a ChatGPT-style product in search on its online store, Bloomberg reported. Amazon may also add more generative AI-like features to Alexa focused on entertainment and storytelling, according to Insider.

The case, which came before Letterkenny Circuit Court this week, has been adjourned until next Thursday for the defendant to provide evidence of his residence at the property and of expenses he claims to have incurred in carrying out improvements.  Mr Hugh Kelly, a 59-year-old of Castledoe, Creeslough, was one of ten people tragically killed in a gas explosion at the Applegreen complex in Creeslough on October 7, 2022.  Letterkenny Circuit Court heard how the late Mr Kelly had given a lift to a man and his young daughter, who also died in the blast, to the shop on the tragic afternoon.  Ms Linda Gallagher said she was the beneficiary of the last will and testament, dated November 30, 2006 of the late Mr Kelly, which included a house, car and out office on lands known as Bishops Island at Castledoe, Creeslough, together with the residue of his estate.  An affidavit from Ms Gallagher said that she attended the property in question on October 15, 2022 and discovered that the deceased’s nephew, Mr Josie Kelly, had ‘wrongfully or illegally entered the dwelling and changed the locks’.  Ms Gallagher, who was represented by Mr Gareth McGrory BL, instructed by solicitor Mr Frank Dorian, alleged that Mr Josie Kelly had unlawfully and wrongfully trespassed and accessed the dwelling house and had also placed padlocks on the gates and placed a donkey on the lands.  The court heard that the late Mr Hugh Kelly had resided at the property - which was described as being a ‘traditional farmhouse with extension and outbuildings’ - all of his life. The court was told that the property was registered in Mr Hugh Kelly’s name having previously been in the name of his mother, Ms Sally Kelly,.  Ms Gallagher sought an injunction to restrain the defendant, his servants or agents from trespassing, entering or making use of the lands without the express authority of the plaintiff.  Mr McGrory said his client was also seeking an injunction to have the defendant, his servants or agents to repair any damage caused following the alleged illegal trespass.  Ms Gallagher is originally from Indiana in the United States and had been in a ‘loving relationship’ with the late Mr Kelly, although they maintained separate houses.  She said she was ‘completely distraught’ on learning of the explosion and the death of Hugh Kelly and the other nine victims of the tragedy.  She described the ‘shock, pain and sorrow’ she suffered in the immediate aftermath of the explosion.  Ms Gallagher said she went to America in late October and when she returned in November she found the gates were chained and padlocked and a donkey was present on the lands.  She told the court that she has sentimental property in the house, including photographs.  In an affidavit, Mr Josie Kelly, who was represented in court by barrister Mr John McCoy BL, said his late grandfather had wished the property to stay in the Kelly family. Mr Josie Kelly said he had invested over €100,000 on improvements to the property and had organised crops of hay and silage on the farmland.  He said he had lived at the property since 1984, save for the years of his marriage until 2018, since which he had been living on the property.  Mr Kelly claimed that none of the plaintiff’s possessions are in the house and that he always had a key and access to the house.  “The property is my home,” he said.  Judge John Aylmer asked why Mr Josie Kelly had not exhibited anything in support of his evidence.  “The absence is striking,” he said, noting that he expected to see evidence that he has been living there since 2018 and of the €100,000 he said he had spent.  Mr McCoy said he would take the matter back to his client for further instruction and said there were ‘parallel proceedings’ before the High Court.  Judge Aylmer said he was giving a short opportunity for the defendant to put evidence before the court ‘that one would expect to support a contention that he has been living there since 2019’.  The matter was adjourned until Carrick-On-Shannon Circuit Court on Thursday-week, May 25, with both deponents to be present.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRvbmVnYWxsaXZlLmllL25ld3MvZG9uZWdhbGxpdmUvMTE3MjgyOS9wYXJ0bmVyLW9mLWNyZWVzbG91Z2gtZXhwbG9zaW9uLXZpY3RpbS1zZWVrcy1pbmp1bmN0aW9uLW92ZXItcHJvcGVydHkuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

London Fire Brigade crews were called to the incident at the weekend on Cecil Road, Harlesden in Brent. Dell Williams (37) is one of the tenants in the two-storey terraced house and was charging his e-scooter in the kitchen of the property when the fire occurred. Luckily for him, and the other residents, they were not nearby when the incident occurred.  The CCTV footage, captured on two cameras in the hallway and in the kitchen of the property shared by the letting agent, shows how quickly the e-scooter caught alight. Dell attempts to tackle the fire with a fire blanket but is overcome by fumes and exits the property.  Security guard Dell bought the e-scooter a fortnight ago from the online marketplace Gumtree, to help him travel around London. He says he was charging the e-scooter in the communal kitchen instead of his room to avoid his dog touching it while it charged.  I'm grateful to be alive  Dell said: “I just want to thank the Lord that we managed to get out of there in one piece! I am so grateful to be alive. I spent eight hours in hospital due to inhaling smoke from the fire and when I went back to the house it was such an eye opener. I was shocked, I am shocked now. I am so grateful that no one else was hurt. I cheated death.”  Thermal runaway can lead to a ferocious fire  London Fire Brigade’s Deputy Commissioner, Dom Ellis, explains while this type of incident is frightening, sadly it is getting more common. Dom said: “As the video shows, once a battery starts to go into thermal runaway a fire develops very quickly and can block escape routes.  “Thermal runaway can lead to the destruction of the battery and a ferocious fire.  “We know prior to ignition thermal runaway can lead to the ejection of a range of gases. The white and grey coloured smoke is not harmless, and the speed at which these incidents develop shouldn’t be ignored.  “Please follow our #ChargeSafe advice and never tackle a fire: get out, stay out and dial 999.”  Don't leave them on charge unattended  Dell wants to advise others who are thinking about purchasing an e-scooter about how to keep safe, he said: “Don’t have e-scooters in the house, charge outside, don’t keep it in the house. Buy e-scooters from a shop where you have a warranty and insurance. These things happen, I wouldn’t say don’t buy one, but if you buy one store them outside so they don’t catch fire. Don’t leave them on charge unattended. Keep people and property safe!”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sb25kb24tZmlyZS5nb3YudWsvbmV3cy8yMDIzL21heS9icmlnYWRlLXNoYXJlcy1mcmlnaHRlbmluZy1mb290YWdlLW9mLWUtc2Nvb3Rlci1iYXR0ZXJ5LWV4cGxvc2lvbi13aXRoLWNoYXJnZXNhZmUtcGxlYS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"explosion","1945-08-06","Not Discerned","{""Hiroshima"", ""Hiroshima"", ""Japan""}","Wed 17 May 2023 17:23:23","Every bit of matter in the universe holds a ton of energy. Einstein's equation, E=MC^2, posits that mass and energy are the same thing but in different forms. And a tiny amount of mass represents a massive amount of energy. So much energy that the atomic weapons used against Japan and the nuclear weapons stockpiled around the world only have to convert a tiny amount of matter into energy to have devastating effects. How tiny? A butterfly's worth.  The Hiroshima bomb  The first atomic weapon launched in anger was the one dropped by the Enola Gay on Hiroshima, Japan on August 6, 1945. The bomb was massive, weighing approximately 9,700 pounds in an age when most bombs weighed less than 4,000. But Little Boy, as the bomb was called, used an inefficient ""gun-type"" design.  A very small amount of matter actually turned into energy. The weapon contained 141 pounds of uranium, about two pounds of it fissioned, and that converted about a gram of it into energy. That little uranium created a 15-kiloton explosion that killed nine out of 10 people within a half mile of the bomb, instantly ignited hundreds or thousands of fires that created a massive firestorm, and flattened buildings and broke windows.  An aerial photo of Hiroshima showing the destruction caused the atomic bomb on Aug. 6, 1945. The photo was in possession of Ralph Richard Hayes, former 20th Air Force, Army Air Corps, 421st Bombardment Squadron bombardier, who served during World War II in Japan. On Aug. 6, 1945, the B-29, Enola Gay, flew over Hiroshima and dropped the first atomic bomb. (Courtesy Photo)  The Nagasaki bomb  Just a few days later, on August 9, America dropped a second atomic bomb on Japan. The ""Fat Man"" bomb dropped by Bock's Car created a 21 kiloton explosion, 40% larger than the Hiroshima blast. It affected 43 square miles with blast, heat, and radiation, flattening even some earthquake-hardened structures and 14,000 homes.  The pit in the Fat Man bomb was much smaller, at 13.6 pounds, but made of plutonium which is more efficient. About 2.2 pounds of plutonium fissioned. That's the weight of a bocce ball. And even less matter was converted than underwent fission.  A B-29 Superfortress painted to commemorate “The Great Artiste”, a silverplate B-29 with the 509th Composite Group, sits as a static display on August 6, 2019, at the Spirit Gate at Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri. The Great Artiste participated in both the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki 74 years prior, providing weather and documentation of the bombings. The aircraft was lost in a crash landing in 1949 in Labrador, Canada. (U.S. Air Force photo by Airman 1st Class Parker J. McCauley)  Bikini Atoll  The Castle Bravo shot at Bikini Atoll in 1954 is the largest thermonuclear explosion ever conducted by the United States. The huge explosion was, in part, a mistake. It was the first test of a ""dry"" thermonuclear device, and designers drastically underestimated how much lithium would increase the efficiency of the weapon.  About a quarter of the weapon's 880 pounds of lithium-6 deuteride underwent fission or fusion. This resulted in a 15-megaton explosion 1,000 times stronger than the explosion at Hiroshima. It also created the largest nuclear contamination incident in U.S. history, exposing hundreds of Pacific islanders and U.S. service members to high levels of radiation.  The Tsar Bomba  The Soviet RDS-220, known in the U.S. as the Tsar Bomba, was the largest nuclear device ever detonated. On October 30, 1961, the Soviets detonated a version with a 50-megaton result. This damaged buildings over 100 miles away and a test witness 170 miles away reported feeling the thermal blast. It created a seismic event that completed three revolutions around the Earth. Insanely, this was the muted version of the Tsar Bomba, with a lead tamper instead of a uranium one. The uranium version is thought to have a 100-megaton yield.  According to an East Tennessee State University lesson supplement, the energy released by Tsar Bomba represented about 5 pounds of matter converting to energy. Those five pounds created a mushroom cloud that rose over 40 miles into the air, seven times higher than Mount Everest.  The continent cracker  Scientists at Livermore Laboratory once proposed an insane double-thermonuclear weapon. Gnomon would create a 1,000-megaton explosion and trigger Sundial which boasted a 10,000-megaton yield, if the scientists' predictions were right.  It's important to note two things: 1) The assembled scientists from other labs immediately laughed it down, and 2) These were the folks whose last three designs had failed.  But if their designs had worked, it would require an approximately 25-ton design, blow a hole in the atmosphere, and instantly burn an area about the size of France. But it would only need to convert about 100 pounds of matter into energy in the first stage and 1,000 pounds in the second stage to achieve the result.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndlYXJldGhlbWlnaHR5LmNvbS9oaXN0b3J5L2hvdy1tdWNoLW1hc3MtaXMtZGVzdHJveWVkLWluLWEtbnVjbGVhci13ZWFwb25zLWV4cGxvc2lvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

This comes three-and-a-half years after its chemical plant exploded and damaged homes all over Mid-County.  The initial explosion happened on November 27, 2019 just before 1 a.m.  Now, thousands of people will be vying for their cut of the settlement and are starting to realize there's not enough money to go around.  Lawyers spearheading this case and trustees from the bankruptcy had a series of meetings Wednesday at the KC Hall in Port Neches.  Wade Kimble lives a few miles from the TPC plant. The explosion left his home with significant damage by blowing doors off the hinges and blowing double-pane windows.  Now, Kimble is among the 8,000 people looking to get a piece of the settlement.  ""That's what i'm irritated at why and how they weren't able to have adequate coverage,"" Kimble said. ""It's just a drop in the bucket compared to the damages.""  TPC filed for bankruptcy in 2021 in Delaware. A settlement was recently announced.  Mark Sparks, a partner at Ferguson Law Firm in Beaumont, is one of the lawyers leading the lawsuits. He says thousands of claims were filed.  ""TPC chose to under-insure itself for its victims, so it didn't have enough insurance and ultimately filed for bankruptcy,"" he said.  Marks says people need to file claim forms to be considered for any of this money.  ""The claim form for these funds, the bankrupt funds that needs to be filed no later than August 1. If you have attorneys and they filed in the mdl they have hopefully sued along with us in the master complainants for all the defendants and this is not the end of the road for you,"" Marks said.  Sparks and other lawyers vow to keep fighting for the families of Mid-County.  They also say, this isn't the end of the legal road.  ""The lawyers myself and all the other firms have sued multiple new defendants that have contributed to this accident. We're seeking their entire insurance policies,"" Marks said.  Sparks said once they get all the claims in, they will decide what's fair and they'll come back to residents with proposals.

"explosion","2018-05-18","10:15:00","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 09:44:33","The last super-eruption at Yellowstone volcano, which occurred 631,000 years ago, was not one huge explosion. Instead, new research suggests it was a series of eruptions or multiple vents spewing volcanic material in rapid succession.  According to the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) Yellowstone Volcano Observatory 2022 Annual Report (opens in new tab), published May 4, fieldwork over the past year has provided new geological evidence that ""the formation of Yellowstone Caldera was much more complex than previously thought."" A caldera is a large crater that forms after the collapse of a volcano following an eruption.  Yellowstone is one of the world's biggest volcanic systems. It sits above one of Earth's ""hotspots"" — areas in the mantle where hot plumes rise and form volcanoes on the crust above. It has produced three caldera-forming eruptions (opens in new tab) in the past 3 million years: the Huckleberry Ridge Tuff eruption, 2.1 million years ago; the Mesa Falls eruption, 1.3 million years ago; and the Lava Creek eruption, 631,000 years ago.  What are super-eruptions?  The Huckleberry Ridge Tuff and Lava Creek events are considered super-eruptions because they expelled over 240 cubic miles (1,000 cubic kilometers) of material. The latter was responsible for the formation of the Yellowstone caldera. Mesa Falls erupted 67 cubic m (280 cubic km) of material, so — while still about 10 times bigger than the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens — is not considered a super-eruption.  Related: Where are most of Earth's volcanoes?  Previous research (opens in new tab) has shown that the Lava Creek super-eruption was not out of the blue; deposits at the Sour Creek Dome region east of the national park suggest that the giant blast was preceded by at least one eruption. Ignimbrite (volcanic rock formed via the deposits of the hot mix of material ejected during an eruption) found at the site had completely cooled before the main, mapped Lava Creek eruption took place.  Researchers have found evidence that there were multiple explosive events during the last super-eruption at Yellowstone. (Image credit: Noppawat Tom Charoensinphon/Getty Images)  To better understand the timeline of the eruption, scientists spent 2022 remapping and collecting samples at Sour Creek Dome.  ""It had always been known that there were at least two geological units [a volume of rock distinct from those surrounding it] from the eruption, and it was thought that there was little to no time gap between them,"" Michael Poland (opens in new tab), scientist-in-charge at the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory, told Live Science in an email. ""Now, we think there are more units. And we're just not sure what the time gap might have been, if any.""  So far, the team has found four previously unrecognized ignimbrite units at Sour Creek, suggesting at least four eruptive pulses. They also found two structures that appear to be eruptive vents, which may have been the sources of these rocks.  ""That could mean either several vents were active and/or there was time separation between the eruptions,"" Poland said. ""But we don't yet have the data we need to answer those questions yet.""  In 2020, scientists found the Huckleberry Ridge Tuff eruption (opens in new tab) — which ejected more than twice the amount of volcanic material as Lava Creek did — was also a phased event. Analysis of rocks at the site suggests there were three separate eruptions, with weeks to months between the first two, and years to decades between the second and third.  Yellowstone volcano is not expected to erupt anytime soon . However, the finding that the Lava Creek eruption may have followed a similar pattern to that of the Huckleberry Ridge Tuff eruption could give an idea of what to expect if and when Yellowstone does blow. ""These major caldera-forming eruptions might not be single events at Yellowstone, but instead have multiple phases,"" Poland said.  Researchers at the volcano now plan to carry out detailed examinations of the newly discovered units and the boundaries between them. This will allow them to paint a more detailed picture of what the Lava Creek eruption looked like — and maybe even what triggered it.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlc2NpZW5jZS5jb20vcGxhbmV0LWVhcnRoL3ZvbGNhbm9zL3llbGxvd3N0b25lLXZvbGNhbm8tc3VwZXItZXJ1cHRpb25zLWFwcGVhci10by1pbnZvbHZlLW11bHRpcGxlLWV4cGxvc2l2ZS1ldmVudHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"explosion","2023-05-18","21:00:00","{""Simferopol"", ""Crimea"", ""Ukraine""}","Thu 18 May 2023 04:08:14","×  KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia fired 30 cruise missiles against different parts of Ukraine early Thursday in the latest nighttime test of Ukrainian air defenses, which shot down 29 of them, officials said.  One person died and two were wounded by a Russian missile that got through and struck an industrial building in the southern region of Odesa, according to Serhiy Bratchuk, a spokesperson for the region's military administration.  Amid the recently intensified Russian air assaults, China said its special envoy met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during talks in Kyiv earlier this week with Ukraine's chief diplomat.  Beijing's peace proposal has so far yielded no apparent breakthrough in the war, and Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said Thursday that the warring parties needed to “accumulate mutual trust” for progress to be made.  Ukrainian officials sought during the talks to recruit China’s support for Kyiv’s own peace plan, according to Ukraine’s presidential office. Zelenskyy’s proposal includes the restoration of his country's territorial integrity, the withdrawal of Russian forces and holding Russian President Vladimir Putin legally accountable for the invasion in February 2022.  Meanwhile, Kremlin-installed authorities in occupied Crimea reported the derailment of eight train cars Thursday because of an explosion, prompting renewed suspicions about possible Ukrainian saboteur activity behind Russian lines. Russian state media reported that the train was carrying grain.  The state news agency RIA Novosti, quoting a source within the emergency services, said the incident occurred not far from the city of Simferopol. The Crimean Railway company said the derailment was caused by “the interference of unauthorized persons” and that there were no casualties.  Ukraine officials refuse to comment on possible acts of sabotage. Ukraine’s military intelligence spokesperson, Andriy Yusov, noted on Ukrainian television that Russian train lines “are also used to transport weapons, ammunition, armored vehicles.”  Overnight, loud explosions were heard in Kyiv as the Kremlin’s forces targeted the capital for the ninth time this month in a clear escalation after weeks of lull and before a much-anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive using newly supplied advanced Western weapons.  Debris fell on two Kyiv districts, starting a fire at a garage complex. There was no immediate word about any victims, Serhii Popko, head of the Kyiv Military Administration, said in a Telegram post.  Ukraine also shot down two Russian exploding drones and two reconnaissance drones, according to authorities.  The missiles were launched from Russian sea, air and ground bases, General Valerii Zaluzhnyi, the Ukrainian commander in chief, wrote on Telegram.  Several waves of missiles were aimed at areas of Ukraine between 9 p.m. Wednesday and 5:30 a.m. Thursday, he said.  Russian forces used strategic bombers from the Caspian region and apparently fired X-101 and X-55-type missiles developed during Soviet times, Kyiv authorities said. Russia then deployed reconnaissance drones over the capital.  In the last major air attack on Kyiv, on Tuesday, Ukrainian air defenses bolstered by sophisticated Western-supplied systems shot down all the incoming missiles, officials said.  That attack used hypersonic missiles, which repeatedly have been touted by Putin as providing a key strategic advantage. The missiles, which are among the most advanced weapons in Russia's arsenal, are difficult to detect and intercept because of their hypersonic speed and maneuverability.  But sophisticated Western air defense systems, including American-made Patriot missiles, have helped spare Kyiv from the kind of destruction witnessed along the main front line in the country’s east and south.  While the ground fighting is largely deadlocked along that front line, both sides are targeting each other's territory with long-range weapons.  The most intense fighting has focused on the battle for the city of Bakhmut and the surrounding area, in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk province, with a Ukrainian military official claiming Thursday that the army advanced up to 1.7 kilometers (more than a mile) there over the previous day.  At the same time, Yevgeny Prigozhin, the millionaire owner of Russia’s private military contractor Wagner whose troops have spearheaded the battle, claimed that Russian army units had retreated from their positions north of the city. Prigozhin is a frequent critic of the Russian military.  At least seven Ukrainian civilians were killed, including a 5-year-old boy, and 18 people were wounded over the previous 24 hours, the presidential office said.  Also, two people were wounded in a drone attack in Russia’s southern Kursk region, which borders Ukraine, the regional governor reported Thursday.  In a Telegram post, Roman Starovoit claimed Ukrainian forces dropped an explosive device from a drone on a sports and recreation complex.  ___  Yuras Karmanau contributed to this report from Tallinn, Estonia.  ___  Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine  ×  ×  ×  ×  ×  ×  ×  ×  ×","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR1cmFuZ29oZXJhbGQuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL2xvdWQtZXhwbG9zaW9ucy1oZWFyZC1pbi1reWl2LWRlYnJpcy1jYXVzZXMtYnVpbGRpbmctZmlyZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

It’s Tuesday, May 9 between 11 a.m. and 11:45 a.m.  There’s a lunch party of 20 at the Red Rooster and it’s being watched over by three Wagoner High School seniors while the boss is out of the restaurant temporarily.  Miranda’s Bakery and Café is selling items and getting ready for the lunch crowd.  An employee of BancFirst has arrived at the east parking lot to pick up someone to go to lunch.  The Locker Room is working on orders in the back.  Wagoner County Clerk Lori Hendricks is in her first floor office facing East Cherokee Street.  Seth Yoder from Edward Jones was driving on Cherokee Street to the office.  One of the Smokin’ Sisters employees was standing behind the bar, but is still making sure that the two Highway Patrolmen are getting their lunch order in fine fashion.  Then, it HITS!  An explosion rocks a major portion of downtown Wagoner.  Once the shock wore off, people came out of their businesses and looked around.  Hendricks looked out the window and saw some kind of large black canister-looking item in the westbound lane.  The parking spot at the BancFirst where someone was picked up for lunch has a small crater made by a round black piece of metal.  Other bits of debris fell even further south.  The Smokin’ Sisters employee nearly doubled over by the blast and noise. The Highway Patrolmen jumped up and left to see what they could do.  Miranda’s employees thought the stove had exploded.  Two of the Red Rooster assistants went out the back door to see what it was. Ironically, the party of 20 did not act like they had even heard it.  “We were all back in the kitchen when it happened and shook all the cups,” said Ashlee Jones.  “Alyssa (Langston) and Joci (Bryant) went out to see. I stayed inside.”  Langston also was caught off guard.  “It was pretty scary,” Langston said. “The whole building shook and it was a loud boom sound.”  Bryant said she thought it was part of some kind of construction.  Yoder was driving down the street and saw debris.  Wagoner Deputy Chief of Police, Tony Ponds, later told officials that the explosion came from just west of the railroad tracks and just south of West Cherokee at a recycling site.  A CNG bottle was being either crushed or recycled in some way without knowing there was something still in it or the release valve was still closed. It’s still not certain.  “It shook the window,” Hendricks said. “I saw it fall from the sky.”  Someone took the time to measure the distance from the debris that fell in the BancFirst parking lot from the recycle center – it measured a quarter of a mile!  There are probably many other reactions by other businesses, but the bottom line is: No one was hurt and there was no property damage, either.  Now, that’s a miracle.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3R1bHNhd29ybGQuY29tL25ld3MvY29tbXVuaXR5L3dhZ29uZXIvd2Fnb25lci1leHBsb3Npb24tc2VuZHMtZGVicmlzLWEtcXVhcnRlci1taWxlLWF3YXkvYXJ0aWNsZV85YWU1Y2JmNC1mMmYwLTExZWQtYTUyMC1hM2QzMDZjMTRjYjMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The man was was taken by ambulance to OSF Saint Anthony Medical Center in Rockford rather than flown because of an expected wait for a medical helicopter, officials said.  The male employee suffered his injuries after a “liquid metal explosion occurred inside a machine.” The release does not say what was happening at the time of the explosion.  The Marengo Fire and Rescue Districts were called to the building at 300 N. West St., Marengo, about 2:30 p.m. for the report of a commercial structure fire, officials said.  Light smoke was showing from the building’s exterior when firefighters arrived four minutes after the call. Employees already had evacuated. The small fire, contained to the immediate area of the machine, was put out in about 10 minutes. No structural damage was reported, and damage estimates were not available from fire officials.  The building was turned back over to the owner about 5 p.m.  According to the company website, the building houses a division of Arnold Magnetic Technologies producing thin and ultra-thin alloys.

But nine were recorded last summer alone. What explains the WNBA's triple-double explosion?  ESPN's Alexa Philippou delved into the phenomenon with a look at how the league and its players have evolved. Nowadays, there's a premium on 3-point shooting and spacing, and fast-paced, free-flowing offenses feature more players capable of playing multiple positions on the floor. Those ""positionless"" players -- facilitating forwards such as Candace Parker and rebounding guards like Sabrina Ionescu -- can stuff the stat sheet in myriad ways.  How much more frequently could triple-doubles happen this season? Will players such as Alyssa Thomas be on nightly triple-double watch once the 2023 season opens Friday? And which WNBA players or current college stars might add their names to the record books?

But just 90 minutes before Ismael De Sousa opened Reunion Bread for business on Sunday, May 14, his bread oven exploded, sparking a large fire inside the bakery at The Source Hotel + Market Hall.  “Thank God no one got injured because it was massive,” De Sousa said. “The bread oven takes up three-quarters of the bakery, but no one was near the oven at the exact moment when it blew up and caught on fire.”  The Denver Fire Department arrived on the scene, as well as a line of shocked customers, but the fire, which De Sousa guessed was caused by a gas leak in the oven, was already out, so DFD helped fan out the remaining smoke.  De Sousa’s team was able to use the ovens at Bellota restaurant next door to save Mother’s Day, but many problems remained.  “It was still a big profit loss because we could only make bread out of that specific oven, and we could only make half of what we sell, like croissants, cookies and pastries,” De Sousa said. “We were running back and forth from the bakery to Bellota for six hours.”  For now, the 2023 James Beard Award semifinalist has temporarily closed the bakery at 3350 Brighton Blvd., but he hopes to reopen this weekend serving Portuguese and Venezuelan pastries, croissants and cookies baked in small convection ovens.  “I have to replace the bread oven, so we’re going to lose our bread business for a while,” De Sousa said. “That type of equipment in the U.S. is a lot of money, but it’s also four months out before I can order one, which will be an interesting few months.”  De Sousa hopes insurance will cover the cost of the bread oven before he has to consider starting a GoFundMe campaign. He wants customers to know that until the equipment is back and up running, the bakery’s product and quality might not be the exact same, since the oven is a crucial part of the baking process.  “When you come in, and there’s no bread, don’t get mad, just understand that something difficult has happened,” De Sousa said. “If you want to help, come buy a croissant or cup of coffee in the meantime.”  Subscribe to our new food newsletter, Stuffed, to get Denver food and drink news sent straight to your inbox.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbnZlcnBvc3QuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTcvcmV1bmlvbi1icmVhZC1maXJlLWV4cGxvc2lvbi1tb3RoZXJzLWRheS1zaHV0cy1iYWtlcnnSAWBodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZW52ZXJwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE3L3JldW5pb24tYnJlYWQtZmlyZS1leHBsb3Npb24tbW90aGVycy1kYXktc2h1dHMtYmFrZXJ5L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"explosion","2023-04-01","Not Discerned","{""BocaChica"", ""SantoDomingo"", ""DominicanRepublic""}","Wed 17 May 2023 10:00:25","On April 20, Elon Musk’s private space exploration company, SpaceX, launched its Starship spacecraft and Super Heavy rocket from Port Isabel, Texas. The launchpad exploded, and the craft, the largest spaceship launched, soared through the air for about four minutes before failing to detach from its booster and exploding over Boca Chica. Residents reported ash and dust coatings on their cars and windows.  This test run brings us another small step toward Mars, but how tests and incidents like this one will affect people’s health and well-being is still an unanswered question. Aerospace engineering professor Moriba Jah from The University of Texas at Austin tells Inverse that we should prepare for more explosions as SpaceX continues trial flights, and that means understanding potential health outcomes.  What did the SpaceX explosion do to the air?  In Port Isabel’s immediate vicinity, visible debris fell from the sky.  This visible matter remained close to the launchpad, but microscopic debris certainly spread farther. An explosion like this results in fine particulate matter (PM2.5, referring to particles that are less than two and a half microns wide), which can hang in the air for about two weeks, according to Sarah Chambliss, an environmental science postdoctoral fellow at the University of Texas Dell Medical School Center for Health & Environment: Education & Research. She says these invisible particles can cause some of the most deleterious air pollution.  “They're totally invisible,” Chambliss tells Inverse. “You don't even smell them.”  These particles travel far, too. If they’re picked up by the wind, they “can disperse across, basically, continental scale,” Chambliss tells Inverse. This is the same reason why the effects of a wildfire in California register all the way over in New York.  The explosion in the air was a medley of heavy metals and rocket fuel. Starship’s Raptor engine, in particular, runs on liquid oxygen and methane — and Starship had 34 engines. “Particulate matter that's high in metal content is more toxic,” Chambliss says.  Does this pollution impact our health?  Inhaling elevated levels of PM2.5, Chambliss says, is linked to inflammation, increased risk of an asthma emergency, increased incidence of asthma, and lung cancer. However, a single event like this can’t be fully responsible for health damage. “You wouldn’t be able to attribute any individual health outcome to an explosion like this,” Chambliss tells Inverse.  More immediately, this explosion harms our environment. Environmental organizations, including the Center for Biological Diversity, the American Bird Conservancy, the Surfrider Foundation, Save RGV, and the Carrizo/Comecrudo Nation of Texas, filed a suit against the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for the damages committed.  How can SpaceX prevent damage next time?  Highly accurate models that give a better idea of potential damage, Jah says, could demonstrate in computer simulations the likelihood of particular outcomes, such as explosions. Aerospace engineering employs these high-fidelity models in aircraft design, but Jah says they’re not yet part of standard practice. Especially when it comes to firsts, like the historically huge and powerful Starship, high-fidelity modeling is essential because learning from mistakes could be too costly.  “If it's all learning from trial and error, that is to the detriment of the environment,” he tells Inverse.  SpaceX has not made a public comment on the explosion’s impact on public health or our environment and did not respond to Inverse for comment in time for publication.  Following the explosion, the FAA has grounded SpaceX’s Starship rockets until it finds that “any system, process, or procedure related to the mishap does not affect public safety,” the FAA said in a statement.  “I do think that it's the ethical responsibility of polluters to deal with the fallout of their pollution,” Chambliss says.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVyc2UuY29tL2hlYWx0aC9zdGFyc2hpcC1leHBsb3Npb24taGVhbHRoLWhhemFyZC1mdXR1cmUtZXhwbG9zaW9ucy1iaWdnZXItcHJvYmxlbdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"explosion","2020-03-23","Not Discerned","{""Stockholm"", ""Stockholm"", ""Sweden""}","Thu 18 May 2023 04:56:14","When stars like our Sun die, they tend to go out with a whimper and not a bang – unless they happen to be part of a binary (two) star system that could give rise to a supernova explosion.  Now, for the first time, astronomers have spotted the radio signature of just such an event in a galaxy more than 400 million light-years away. The finding, published today in Nature, holds tantalizing clues as to what the companion star must have been like.  An explosive star death  As stars up to eight times heavier than our Sun start to run out of nuclear fuel in their core, they puff off their outer layers. This process gives rise to the colorful clouds of gas misleadingly known as planetary nebulae, and leaves behind a dense, compact hot core known as a white dwarf.  Our own Sun will undergo this transition in 5 billion years or so, then slowly cool and fade away. However, if a white dwarf somehow puts on weight, a self-destruct mechanism kicks in when it gets heavier than about 1.4 times the mass of our Sun.  The subsequent thermonuclear detonation destroys the star in a distinctive kind of explosion called a Type Ia supernova.  But where would the extra mass come from to fuel such a bang?  We used to think it could be gas being stripped off a bigger companion star in a close orbit. But stars tend to be messy eaters, spilling gas everywhere.  A supernova explosion would shock any spilt gas and make it glow at radio wavelengths. Despite decades of searching however, not a single young Type Ia supernova has ever been detected with radio telescopes.  Instead, we began to think Type Ia supernovae must be pairs of white dwarfs spiraling inwards and merging together in a relatively clean fashion, leaving no gas to shock – and no radio signal.  A rare type of supernova  Supernova 2020eyj was discovered by a telescope in Hawai'i on March 23 2020. For the first seven weeks or so it behaved in much the same way as any other Type Ia supernova.  But for the next five months, it stopped fading in brightness. Around the same time, it began to show features indicating gas that was unusually rich in helium.  We began to suspect Supernova 2020eyj belonged to a rare subclass of Type Ia supernovae in which the blast wave, moving at more than 10,000 kilometers per second, sweeps past gas that could only have been stripped off the outer layers of a surviving companion star.  To try to confirm our hunch, we decided to test if there was enough gas being shocked to produce a radio signal. As the supernova is too far north to observe with telescopes like the Australia Telescope Compact Array near Narrabri, we instead used an array of radio telescopes spread across the United Kingdom to observe the supernova about 20 months after the explosion.  To our great surprise, we had the first-ever clear detection of an ""infant"" Type Ia supernova at radio wavelengths, confirmed by a second observation some five months later. Could this be the ""smoking gun"" that not all Type Ia supernovae are caused by the merger of two white dwarfs?  frameborder=""0″ allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"" allowfullscreen>  Patience pays off  One of the more remarkable properties of Type Ia supernovae is that they all seem to reach pretty much the same peak brightness. This is consistent with them all having reached a similar critical mass before exploding.  This very attribute allowed astronomer Brian Schmidt and colleagues to reach their Nobel Prize-winning conclusion in the late 1990s: that the universe's expansion since the Big Bang is not slowing down under gravity (as everyone had expected), but is accelerating due to the effects of what we now call dark energy.  So, Type Ia supernovae are important cosmic objects, and the fact we still don't know exactly how and when these stellar explosions occur, or what makes them so consistent, has been a worry to astronomers.  In particular, if pairs of merging white dwarfs can range in total mass up to almost three times the mass of our Sun, why should they all release about the same amount of energy?  Our hypothesis (and radio confirmation) that Supernova 2020eyj occurred when enough helium gas was stripped off the companion star and onto the surface of the white dwarf to push it just over the mass limit, provides a natural explanation for this consistency.  The question now is why we haven't seen this radio signal before in any other Type Ia supernova. Perhaps we tried to detect them too soon after the explosion, and gave up too easily. Or maybe not all companion stars are as helium-rich and prodigious in shedding their gaseous outer layers.  But as our study has shown, patience and persistence sometimes pays off in ways we never expected, allowing us to hear the dying whispers of a distant star.

More than two dozen people were injured after an explosion in Tijuana, Mexico, a few miles south of the San Ysidro Port of Entry Tuesday morning, prompting a large response from rescuers from various local agencies.  The video shows an SUV approaching and a pair of pedestrians, one of whom appears to be using a cane, caught in the blast. After the shock wave hits, the people are down in the street, and one slowly struggles upright. The other never appears to awaken. The SUV slowly backs down the street as the dust settles, with debris now scattered across the street.  The boom shook the Blancas building in Tijuana's East Zone at around 9:35 a.m. The building houses a print shop, a furniture store, a car detailing shop and a spare parts store. Atop the businesses were apartments that were not meant to be inhabited, according to the Tijuana Civil Protection Agency.

Tijuana fire crews evacuated several people from the building and began rescue work. Authorities initially reported two people were believed to be trapped at the scene. After an hour and a half of work, firefighters were able to free one person who was trapped in the basement. The individual suffered first- and second-degree burns and was one of several transported to area hospitals, the agency said.  At least 25 people were injured, according to the Tijuana Fire Department — four with serious injuries, six in moderate condition and 15 with minor injuries. Rafael Cabillo, Tijuana's fire director, told Telemundo 20 that the search for other victims continues.  ""The houses that were in the upper part were already red-tagged and the upper part should not be inhabited,"" Bernardo Villegas, director of Tijuana Civil Protection, said in Spanish. ""I think that there was a repair of these houses and they rented them. All the people who were evacuated did not leave with injuries; [they] were outside the [explosion] area.""  The owner of the building, who did not want to provide his name to Telemundo 20, confirmed that another explosion occurred a few years ago in the same place.  ""The second location has an underground gas build-up. I can't tell you why; this is the second time this has happened to us. The disaster was four times bigger than [four] years ago,"" he said in Spanish.  The Secretary of Security and Citizen Protection, the fire department, the municipal police, Civil Protection, the Red Cross and seven private ambulances responded to the incident.

These forthcoming rules hold immense potential for the crypto landscape, with several coins poised to benefit, including notable contenders such as $Lina, $ACH, $CFX, and $COCOS.  CFX is the native token of the CryptoFights platform, while COCOS is the native token of the Cocos-BCX blockchain. Both coins are based in China and have a significant Chinese user base.  CFX was launched in 2018 and is based on the Neo blockchain. It is a decentralized gaming platform that allows users to play games, earn rewards, and trade in-game items. COCOS was launched in 2019 and is based on the Ethereum blockchain. It is a decentralized gaming platform that focuses on blockchain-based games.  Both CFX and COCOS have been successful in attracting users and developers. CFX has a market capitalization of over $1 billion and COCOS has a market capitalization of over $500 million. Both coins are listed on major cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance and Huobi.  CFX and COCOS are both promising projects with the potential to disrupt the gaming industry.  SFC’s regulations are set to instill confidence in the crypto sector  Driven by a steadfast commitment to investor protection and market integrity, the SFC’s comprehensive and robust regulations are set to instill confidence in the crypto sector. By mandating VASPs to obtain licenses, conduct thorough customer due diligence, maintain transaction records, and comply with anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) measures, these regulations are poised to create a more secure and compliant environment for all stakeholders.  Recognizing the significance of these regulations, the Hong Kong Blockchain Association has praised the SFC’s proactive approach, hailing the rules as a positive step towards enhancing the cryptocurrency industry in Hong Kong. By establishing a framework that balances innovation and security, these regulations are poised to unlock the full potential of cryptocurrencies and drive further adoption in the region.  While critics have voiced concerns about potential innovation stifling or insufficient investor protection, it is essential to appreciate that the SFC has meticulously calibrated these regulations to strike the right balance. By taking a risk-based enforcement approach, the SFC aims to target those VASPs that pose the greatest risk to investors, leaving room for growth and fostering an environment that encourages responsible innovation.  As the industry eagerly awaits the implementation of these forward-looking regulations, Hong Kong’s cryptocurrency landscape is poised for a remarkable transformation. With $Lina, $ACH, $CFX, and $COCOS among the frontrunners benefiting from enhanced regulatory oversight, the stage is set for these coins to shine and capture the attention of savvy investors seeking promising opportunities.  The embrace of these regulations by Hong Kong signifies the region’s commitment to becoming a global hub for cryptocurrency innovation. As the regulatory framework solidifies, these coins and the broader crypto market are well-positioned for a bright and prosperous future, built on trust, transparency, and investor confidence.

Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee announced ex gratia of Rs 2.5 lakh for the families of the deceased. She said the owner of this illegal firecracker factory was arrested earlier but he got bail.  Responding to the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party’s National Investigation Agency probe into the blast, Banerjee said she does not have a problem with the NIA but the matter should not be politicised.  State Environment Minister Manas Ranjan Bhunia confirmed the explosion and said that the government would take steps to provide help to people affected. “We appeal to people to inform us of any illegal firecracker factories that they know of in their area… we will take strong steps against such units,” he said.  A police official said the impact of the explosion “was so massive” that the factory, which was being run from a residential building, collapsed. “It took place inside a house where the firecracker unit was functioning. An investigation is underway,” the police officer added.

He is widely regarded as one of the best strikers in the world and has won numerous awards and accolades throughout his career. In fact, he also won the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in recognition of his services to football.  Aside from making a name for himself in soccer, the 29-year-old has done quite a social work that mainly revolves around mental health. The Tottenham star has even launched a foundation under his own name. The foundation mainly caters to mental health issues. Hence, in an attempt to create more awareness about the issue, the player has teamed up with many partners.  With the ongoing Mental Health Awareness Week, Kane is busy enlightening people about the issue. In fact, he recently sat down with F1 star George Russell to talk about the crucial subject.

Both famous sportspeople had some wise words to say. “Obviously, we both started to learn more and more about mental health recently. And this chat today is just to share some of our experiences, I guess, that we’ve both gone through in our careers so far, the highs and lows,” said Kane.

But then, they don’t always understand what you’re going through in an elite environment either.”  The skipper insisted that it was important to have people around you who can listen to you. “So that’s why I try and say to people look, talk to as many people as you can, tell them how you’re feeling. Because everyone sees things in different ways and their opinions and people are there to listen and people are there to support you and give you advice on what they think,” he added.

"explosion","2023-03-01","Not Discerned","{""Alabama"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 22:03:00","By James Rogers  Debut has been delayed after explosion during test launch earlier this year  United Launch Alliance is eyeing a debut launch for the company's new Vulcan rocket later this year, according to Chief Executive Tory Bruno.  Vulcan will be the successor to ULA's Delta IV and Atlas V rockets. ULA was set up in 2006 as a joint venture between Boeing Co. (BA) and Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT). Since then, the company's Delta and Atlas rockets have been used to send more than 150 missions into orbit.  ""I expect we will see that [first Vulcan] launch sometime between summer and later this year,"" Bruno said during a streamed interview at the Human to Mars Summit in Washington on Tuesday.  ULA had initially planned for a Vulcan debut launch in May, but that was pushed back when a Vulcan rocket's upper stage suffered an anomaly during testing at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama in March, according to Space.com. The explosion was first reported by Ars Technica. Bruno subsequently tweeted that a hydrogen leak caused an explosion during the test.  Space.com reported that the upper stage that exploded was not part of the hardware for the debut Vulcan launch. ""We will sort that out, we will resolve it,"" Bruno said Tuesday.  Related:Virgin Galactic sets sights on first commercial launch  ULA undertook Vulcan rocket tests to simulate a launch day at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station last week.  Vulcan's booster propulsion is provided by a pair of BE-4 engines manufactured by Blue Origin, which was founded by Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos. ""I am very happy with my partner there,"" said Bruno.  The BE-4 engines use liquid oxygen and liquefied natural gas, a commercially available form of methane. Unlike other rocket propellants, such as kerosene, liquefied natural gas eliminates the need for expensive and complex pressurization systems, such as helium, which is in increasingly scarce supply, according to ULA.  The new ULA rocket also integrates up to six Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC) Solid Rocket Boosters, or SRBs.  Speaking at the Humans to Mars Summit, Bruno also discussed ULA's contract with Amazon to support its Project Kuiper, which will launch a constellation of 3,236 satellites into low Earth orbit. The deal, which was announced last year, will see the Vulcan rocket used for 38 launches.  See Now: SpaceX's Starship launch sent dust cloud of sand and soil over nearby city  ""I have to quadruple my launch rate by the middle of 2025,"" said Bruno, describing the project as ""a great challenge to have.""  -James Rogers  This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"explosion","2023-05-13","Not Discerned","{""Poland"", ""Maine"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 12:00:53","Scientists in Denmark are puzzled by a series of tremors from the Danish Baltic island of Bornholm who have claimed that it is being caused by ""acoustic pressure waves from the atmosphere”, and added that they are unable to ascertain the source of this mysterious geological phenomenon.  These tremors were first recorded on Saturday, after the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GUES)—the official body that monitors the underground—received ""more than 60"" tips from people in Bornholm about ""earthquake-like tremors"" reported in the afternoon.  They described the tremors as deep rumbling, shaking and rattling, and changing pressure in the ear.  Initially, many falsely believed that they may have been caused by earthquakes. Seismologists had theorised that they may have originated from controlled explosions in Poland, more than nearly 90 miles (145 km) to the south.  However, on Monday, the GUES clarified that the tremors were ""not caused by earthquakes, but by pressure waves from an event in the atmosphere."" However, they came from ""an unknown source.""  ""The seismologists can report that it is unlikely that the tremors originate from a controlled explosion in Poland, which was carried out shortly before the first reports of tremors on Bornholm,"" the body known as GEUS said in a statement. Scientists develop fabric made of 'Fungi' which needs no stitching Danish media reported that police had received complaints from the public about the tremor on the eastern part of the island. The tremors also caused a crack in the wall of some of the houses. But no one was injured.  The Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland said that seismic tremors were measured at a magnitude of 2.3.  Polish authorities have said that there was intensive activity during the Anakonda23 exercise in Ustka, northern Poland, involving jet fighters and live firing of artillery munitions.  GEUS, an independent research and advisory institution within Denmark’s Ministry of Climate, Energy and Utilities, said that it had two seismographs on Bornholm that collect data around the clock.  Bornholm is home to nearly 40,000 people. It is a rocky island in the Baltic Sea, south of Sweden, northeast of Germany and north of Poland.

"explosion","2023-07-01","Not Discerned","{""Bellevue"", ""Washington"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 17:25:00","Omega Strikers was recently fully released this month. The game is a MOBA-like game where teams of three work to disable the opposing team’s barriers and score, akin to air hockey. Each of the 15 characters brings something unique to the table, such as Rune’s barriers that double as both goalie tools and ways to damage enemy players or Era’s powerful support tools that buff allies and debuff opposing players.  The game launched with 15 playable characters, three of which were added on the initial release oof the game after it left Steam Early Access. The game also saw console ports over the past two weeks (to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and Xbox consoles). Over the past week, Odyssey has been teasing new content, which comes in today’s big patch.  This update brings two brand-new playable characters to the game, Octavia and Vyce. Both of them also have kit breakdowns released that we’ll go over. First, Octavia; her kit focuses on buffing herself and maintaining momentum, as her Secondary ability is an infinitely stacking speed boost that extends so long as you’re hitting the Core. Her Primary ability is a projectile that deals damage and slows, making it a good disruption tool. Finally, Octavia’s Special emits five pulses that damage an area around her periodically.  You can view Octavia’s gameplay trailer below.  Comparatively, Vyce looks to be quite a powerful offensive character. She has access to a stun with an area-of-effect radius in her Secondary slot, and her Primary is a projectile with a pretty good range. Vyce’s Special ability involves her remaining immobile and charging up a big shockwave that grows in size the longer you charge it. Upon release, anything inside the shockwave takes big damage. While charging, Vyce has full knockback immunity but can still take damage.  You can view Vyce’s gameplay trailer below.  Today’s update for Omega Strikers also contains a new battle arena in the form of the Demon Dais stage. This new stage has two separate barriers in the form of large speakers on each side of the field with two barriers within. The update also has new skins for Kai, Atlas, and Ai.Mi, and some balance changes (including a full rework for Asher) which can all be read here.  We’ll continue to update as more information on Omega Strikers, including DLC, trailers, updates, and more, as it’s released. Omega Strikers is available now on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL29tZWdhLXN0cmlrZXJzLWJyaW5ncy10aGUtZXhwbG9zaXZlLWRlYnV0LW9mLW9jdGF2aWEtYW5kLXZ5Y2Utd2l0aC1tYXNzaXZlLWJhbGFuY2UtcGF0Y2gv0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly93Y2NmdGVjaC5jb20vb21lZ2Etc3RyaWtlcnMtYnJpbmdzLXRoZS1leHBsb3NpdmUtZGVidXQtb2Ytb2N0YXZpYS1hbmQtdnljZS13aXRoLW1hc3NpdmUtYmFsYW5jZS1wYXRjaC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"explosion","2021-02-21","Not Discerned","{""Paris"", ""IleDeFrance"", ""France""}","Wed 17 May 2023 05:50:24","It was an average Monday on February 21, 2021, car doors were slamming as people traversed roads on their way to work. The last days of Winter grew closer and the sun began shining a little brighter with every passing moment. Everything was seemingly perfect for the average fan of Daft Punk, that was until the duo made a rare appearance on social media to announce that after 28 years of groundbreaking production and mesmerizing melodies, they are calling it quits. The announcement of their split was paired with a clip from the closing scenes of their 2006 film “Electrorama”, which saw the pair in full Daft Punk garb shaking hands and walking off, only for one member to reveal a bomb and promptly explode. That explosion became more than a cinematic trick as every blog and Daft Punk fan page blew up with fond memories and grief for one of the most successful music groups in recent memory.  Attempting to sum up Daft Punk’s impact on music in one article is a fool’s errand, so let’s focus on a moment in their career that changed the Daft Punk history books as we knew it. 2013 was far from the group’s “break out” year but it did see a massive resurgence in popularity for the duo, and not because an old classic was resurfaced for the sake of social media. 10 years ago (5/17/13), Daft Punk released what would be their final album together. Random Access Memories birthed the tremendously popular single “Get Lucky”, which featured Pharell Williams crooning over funky live instrumentation which included the now iconic guitar melodies strummed out by the great Nile Rodgers. While the album now marks the last official release for Daft Punk, its impact on Daft Punk’s career was obvious long before their break up 8 years later.  Random Access Memories is the duo’s first studio album since 2005’s Human After All which saw the band deconstruct their signature production style and rebuild it into an industrial wall of sound. Coming off what could now be considered Daft Punk’s most aggressive LP and giving fans plenty of time in between releases, Daft Punk was able to completely wipe the slate clean. They’ve already pushed the boundaries of electronic pop and their final album would aim to conquer an area of music that Daft Punk never had the opportunity to take part in. The album has the duo shifting their focus to a more disco-friendly sonic direction and began incorporating live instrumentation into their recording process, leaving only a few programmed drum machines and vintage vocoder melodies as traces of their past sound. This allowed Daft Punk’s music to sound larger than ever, with songs like the explosive intro “Give Life Back To Music” and the Paul Williams-assisted “Touch” bringing a sleek shine to the LP. Random Access Memories is driven by deep grooves, infectious rhythms, and pure love for dance music, and the extensive list of A-list collaborators is only the icing on the cake.  You know there is something special about an album when it takes this long into talking about it to mention that there is a stirringly beautiful Julian Casablancas ballad on the tracklist. For the first time in their careers, Daft Punk opened their studio doors to outside collaborators to help work on a studio album of theirs and they brought in a cast of characters only Daft Punk can assemble. Along with the aforementioned Casablancas and Paul Williams, the likes of Panda Bear, Todd Edwards, Pharrell Williams, and Nile Rodgers are credited as guests on Random Access Memories. What makes these appearances so special is how Daft Punk deployed them, the duo brought these features into their world to uplift their compositions, only bringing in guests when necessary. They could’ve gotten anyone to sing on “The Game of Love” but they seemed to be just as happy with their robotically smooth vocals taking the spotlight. The Panda Bear-assisted “Doin’ It Right” is a minimal, repetitive dance track that has Bear harmonizing with those same vocals from “The Game of Love”, not the usual Panda Bear ascetic but a role he filled beyond expectations. Daft Punk’s use of features on Random Access Memories speaks to not only their overall creativity but may have hinted that their break up nearly a decade later was clear from the release of the album, using Random Access Memories to knock off some bucket list collaborations in a sensational fashion.  Random Access Memories now has somewhat of a bittersweet taste to it 10 years later. While it now acts as Daft Punk’s swan song, it also stands as a testament to two musicians who approached their art with tireless creativity and delivered unforgettable moments of pure fun and musicianship. In 2013 it seemed like Daft Punk had nothing else to prove, they had hits and had won over the hearts of snobby critics and hard-headed music fans alike with their refreshing take on electronic pop music. They approached their fourth studio album as if they had already decided it was their last and left nothing to be desired. The 13 songs that comprise the LP take you through the colorful cosmos of Daft Punk as the duo waves goodbye in an explosion of vivid arrangements, undeniable chemistry, and, most important of all, unforgettable electronic music.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vZ2xpZGVtYWdhemluZS5jb20vMjkxMjczLzEwLXllYXJzLWxhdGVyLXJldmlzaXRpbmctZGFmdC1wdW5rcy1jb2xsYWJvcmF0aXZlLWdhbWUtY2hhbmdlci1yYW5kb20tYWNjZXNzLW1lbW9yaWVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"explosion","2023-03-24","Not Discerned","{""Luhansk"", ""Lugansk"", ""Ukraine""}","Tue 16 May 2023 11:27:58","LONDON -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pressed the British government at the end of a whirlwind European tour Monday to join a ""fighter jet coalition"" that would help strengthen his country's aerial capabilities, but instead secured a commitment for attack drones and hundreds more missiles.  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak greeted Zelenskyy with a handshake and hug after the president's helicopter landed at Chequers, the British leader's official country retreat. It was Zelenskyy's second trip to the U.K. since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, and the fifth European country he's visited in three days.  He is seeking more military aid as Ukraine prepares a long-anticipated spring offensive to retake Russian-occupied territory. The Ukrainian leader also visited Italy, the Vatican, Germany and France.  Russia reacted to the U.K.'s new pledge ""extremely negatively,"" but also doubts that the missiles and drones would drastically change the course of the war, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday.  ""Britain aspires to be at the forefront among countries that continue to pump weapons into Ukraine,"" Peskov said. ""We repeat once again: It cannot yield any drastic and fundamental influence on the way the special military operation (in Ukraine) is unfolding. But definitely it leads to further destruction. ... It makes this whole story for Ukraine much more complicated.""  Zelenskyy said one of the missions of his European travels that started Saturday was to build a ""fighter jet coalition"" to provide Ukraine with vital military power in the air. He said more work was needed on that front.  While the U.K. will not provide the planes, the prime minister said the country would join the coalition and begin a previously announced training program for Ukrainian fighter pilots as soon as this summer.  The U.K., one of Ukraine's major military allies, has provided short-range missiles, Challenger tanks and trained 15,000 Ukrainian troops on British soil. Last week, the government announced it had sent Ukraine Storm Shadow cruise missiles, which have a range of more than 150 miles. The British missiles were the first known shipment of longer-range weaponry that Kyiv has long sought from its allies.  Sunak's office said it was giving Ukraine hundreds more air defense missiles, as well as ""long-range attack drones"" with a reach of more than 120 miles.  ""This is a crucial moment in Ukraine's resistance to a terrible war of aggression they did not choose or provoke,"" Sunak said. ""They need the sustained support of the international community to defend against the barrage of unrelenting and indiscriminate attacks that have been their daily reality for over a year.  ""We must not let them down,"" the prime minister added.  Sunak plans to push allies at a meeting of the Group of Seven leaders in Japan later this week to deliver more support to Ukraine, his representative said.  As Zelenskyy visited European capitals, Russia increased its attacks across Ukraine with drones and missiles. Russia shelled two communities Sunday in the northern border province of Sumy, regional officials said on Telegram. They said 109 explosions were recorded.  Zelenskyy's office said Monday that Russian attacks had killed nine civilians and injured 19 in the past day. Six of the deaths were in southern Ukraine's Kherson province. Two civilians were killed in Chuhuiv in Kharkiv province, and one in Prymorsk, on the Azov Sea coast about 12 miles from Russian-occupied Berdyansk.  The presidential office also reported that Marhanets, which lies across the river from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, was shelled.  Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti reported that an acting regional interior minister appointed by Moscow, Igor Kornet, was injured in an explosion at a barbershop in the Russian-occupied city of Luhansk. The leader of the Luhansk People's Republic, a separatist-held region of Ukraine that Moscow illegally annexed, was quoted as saying a bomb caused the explosion.  Assassination attempts and sabotage attacks have increased in Russian-occupied territory as well as Russia proper. Russian authorities often blame Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv rarely acknowledges such attacks.  Zelenskyy traveled to Britain from Paris, where he met Sunday with French President Emmanuel Macron and secured a pledge of light tanks, armored vehicles and air defense systems.      About 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers will receive training in France this year and nearly 4,000 others in Poland, Macron's office said.  Speaking Monday on the French television network TF1, Macron said training on French fighter jets such as the Mirage 2000 ""can start now"" but rejected the idea of France delivering warplanes to Ukraine.  Zelenskyy also met with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Sunday. It was his first visit to Berlin since the start of the invasion and came a day after the German government announced military aid for Ukraine worth more than $3 billion.  Modern Western hardware is considered crucial if Ukraine is to succeed in its planned counteroffensive. During his European trip, Zelenskyy said Ukraine would aim to liberate Russian-occupied areas within Ukraine's internationally recognized borders and would not attack Russian territory.  Among areas Russia still occupies are the Crimean Peninsula and parts of eastern Ukraine with mainly Russian-speaking populations.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm53YW9ubGluZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzL21heS8xNi96ZWxlbnNreXktcHVzaGVzLWZvci1maWdodGVyLWpldC1jb2FsaXRpb24vP25ld3Mtd29ybGTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Lido DAO (LDO) price has set the performance bar rather high for itself this summer. With bulls chasing price action higher on Monday, a rejection occurred as bulls ventured to attack $2.20, where both a pivotal level and the 55-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) are being used by bears as defensive structures. Once that area is reclaimed by bulls this week, expect to see a rally that could go well into the summer and hit $3.37 with a 60% profit in the books.  Lido DAO price to be the trade of the season out of the bunch  Lido DAO price is already heading for a very solid performance with a 10% gain already on record for this week. From the looks of it, bulls are back with a vengeance and have already erased all incurred losses for May. If bulls play this right, this could be the best recovery trade of the year, and LDO is set to outperform some peers in the process.  LDO first needs to pare the selling pressure from bears at $2.20, where they have built a fortress around that historically pivotal level and the 55-day SMA that resides nearby. With the bullish performance setting the tone for this week, expect to see that level being torn down later on Tuesday and bulls heading for $2.60. The rally should continue into July with a few catalysts along the way that could lift LDO higher and head toward $3.37.  LDO/USD 4H-chart  A threat to the downside could come with another rejection at $2.20 and one of the tail risks in the US inflating again, such as the on-again-off-again banking turmoil or the debt ceiling negotiations. Expect then to see a leg lower with $2 doubtful to hold. Rather look for $1.85 and the 200-day SMA in between $2 and $1.85 as a circuit breaker to slow down any violent drops depending on the severity of the tail risk or catalyst.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ4c3RyZWV0LmNvbS9jcnlwdG9jdXJyZW5jaWVzL25ld3MvbGlkby1kYW8tcHJpY2UtaXMtYWJvdXQtdG8tZXhwbG9kZS02MC1hbmQtYnJlYWstYWJvdmUtMy0yMDIzMDUxNjExMTbSAXdodHRwczovL3d3dy5meHN0cmVldC5jb20vYW1wL2NyeXB0b2N1cnJlbmNpZXMvbmV3cy9saWRvLWRhby1wcmljZS1pcy1hYm91dC10by1leHBsb2RlLTYwLWFuZC1icmVhay1hYm92ZS0zLTIwMjMwNTE2MTExNg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Check the funding of deployer's wallets (examine the prelaunch transactions of deployment wallet, ideally finding a 'clean' wallet, in which the only transactions are the purchase of ETH and the creation of the smart contract address). Check if the contract address is verified (this can be done on Etherscan). Check if meme coin liquidity has been locked (it is important to ensure LPs are locked to ensure you can complete later sale of coins). Check if the meme coin project has an active Website, Twitter account, Telegram and Medium (the greater the social media presence, the less chance of a rug pull). Double-check whether the token has both buys and sells (using tools that monitor DEX transactions to avoid honey pots). Check the token holders (if huge swathes of supply are held by few wallets, this could lead to seismic dumping action). Check the buy and sell fees (if transaction fees to deployer are higher than 10% avoid).  By following these steps you can begin to develop a well-researched understanding of what makes a meme coin legitimate, however, to undertake these checks will require a depth of crypto expertise and a familiarity with complex DEX tools.

Despite the extremely wet winter the whole region experienced, Wilbourn said fire crews are still expecting to see active fires this summer.""We've got the taller grass. It's obviously been growing for a while, but then you see underneath, there's a lower-level grass. We call that a double growth. So obviously, there's been different parts of the season where we experienced rain and then we've had a lull to allow the grass to grow, then it goes back to rain, and now we're seeing hot weather again, so these are just different levels of growth that really creates a dense fuel load,"" Wilbourn said. ""The overall landscape and topography of our area in the flat region. It's going to be hot. Fuels are going to dry out very quickly and we're going to continue to have fires.""Wilbourn said that includes fires that begin at homeless encampments, which he said have been increasing in Sacramento County.""Year over year, we've seen an 111% increase in unhoused-related fires, so that means people that are out in the fields, maybe they're cooking for themselves. They have an open flame. The fire gets away and runs and potentially causes a larger fire,"" Wilbourn said.Firefighters from the Sacramento Fire Department and the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District responded to a homeless encampment fire Tuesday afternoon. A spokesperson with the Sacramento Fire Department told KCRA 3 that trees started to catch fire just after 4 p.m. on 14th Avenue near Power Inn Road in Sacramento. Fire crews arrived within minutes and quickly put out the flames.Cellphone video sent to KCRA 3 shows the moments the flames jumped into the higher branches of the trees. Amalia Valencia, who works nearby, said the fire started when she was finishing up some paperwork at the office.""I heard a loud bang — a loud explosion,"" Valencia said. ""It's very scary. I mean, our shop is just right across.""Valencia said she figured the fire had started at the homeless encampment, which she said has caused issues in the area before. Debris and trash can be seen all across that section of land. Valencia said she is grateful the fire did not spread too far, but she added that she is concerned about the summer months.""I had walked through here before and I saw that there were several gas tanks and a barbecue grill on this section area, and I had told my brother, 'Oh, that’s eventually going to end up happening,'"" Valencia said.Sacramento fire officials said firefighters are currently going through wildfire refresher training so that everyone can be prepared to battle fires this summer. Experts are also reminding people who live in areas near dry brush to create some defensible space around their homes.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtjcmEuY29tL2FydGljbGUvc2FjcmFtZW50by1jcmV3cy1wcmVwYXJlLXdpbGRsYW5kLWVuY2FtcG1lbnQtZmlyZXMvNDM5MTIyNDnSAVxodHRwczovL3d3dy5rY3JhLmNvbS9hbXAvYXJ0aWNsZS9zYWNyYW1lbnRvLWNyZXdzLXByZXBhcmUtd2lsZGxhbmQtZW5jYW1wbWVudC1maXJlcy80MzkxMjI0OQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"explosion","2020-08-15","Not Discerned","{""Beirut"", ""Beirut"", ""Lebanon""}","Wed 17 May 2023 06:42:24","One night, around ten years ago in Lebanon, when I was supposed to be deep in my dreams, I came across a picture of some street in New York on a stranger’s Facebook page. I ran to my mom, asking her if we could go there in the summer, and she kept nodding her head until it was convincing enough for me to go back to sleep. Ten years later, the New York City lights keep me awake all night long. I remain in a waking dream.  On my plane to NYC, I kept wondering why the Stanford in New York program would choose that our dorms be located in Brooklyn as opposed to Manhattan, the heart of the city. In my head, that only meant missing out on events, a longer commute and wasted hours. I was wrong.  Brooklyn Heights feels exactly like my hometown, Saida, while being nothing like it. It is close to the city but also far from it. Brooklyn Heights, just like Saida, is the best of both worlds.  The Stanford in New York apartments are next to the Brooklyn Heights promenade, which offers among the most iconic views in the city. You can see the Brooklyn Bridge, the Empire State building, the Chrysler building and even the Statue of Liberty while standing there. You can peek into the chaos and the rush of the cars while basking in the sun, watching it go down and making sure you take the right pictures so that you will not have to come back tomorrow, which you already know you will.  On Sunday, I sat there on a bench next to a married couple, with my favorite Montague Street Bagels, and I noticed how most people were silent, even though their footsteps were audible.  On Monday, as I took a lunch break from my work at the NYC Commission on Human Rights, I couldn’t even call my mom because I was distracted by the conversations around me, curious to know more, but also because I couldn’t hear a word she said.  Beirut has changed a lot after the August 2020 explosion, but it remains a lively city that blooms during the summers when foreigners and immigrants come back to celebrate togetherness and visit their old memories. Being in Beirut means hearing music from every corner, having to cover your ears when cars start honking at a minor inconvenience and listening to conversations of girls your age planning their weekend getaways because they wanted to “party the pain away.”  I’d spend my days in Beirut, hopping from one friend’s apartment to the next, eating take-out food and complaining about the skyrocketing prices. Sometimes, I was too enraptured in that chaos, thinking about relocating with no real plan or strategy. However, all I needed was a single voice message from my mom, telling me what my grandmother cooked today and how I should come back so we could watch “Olympus has fallen” for the tenth time together; telling me to come back to Saida.  Saida has also changed a lot after the Beirut explosion. People hide their trauma behind their smiles in the most noticeable way possible. What characterizes Saida is the people inhabiting it. Living there, you have to negotiate for thirty minutes before accepting a gift, try out every food on the table or explain to the host that it wouldn’t be personal if you fail and end every day with a coffee run with your favorite people, bumping into at least five of your least favorite people. Saida is more intimate. You spend your whole life dreaming of getting out and once you do, you start counting down the days till you’re back. While I enjoy traveling to new places, I’ve never met people like the ones in Saida.  Saida is the perfect balance to Beirut, but Beirut is not the same without Saida. The same way that Brooklyn Heights is the perfect balance to Manhattan, but Manhattan is not the same without Brooklyn Heights.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vc3RhbmZvcmRkYWlseS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8xNi90aGUtYmVzdC1vZi1ib3RoLXdvcmxkcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Last season the Green Raiders made it back to the District 1 tournament, but were bounced quickly in the opening round. The last time Ridley hosted a playoff game before Tuesday was in 2017. And the last time the team won in the postseason, home or away, came in 2015, when Bosak and Ridley’s current senior class were elementary school students.  The Hofstra recruit wanted to put on a show against No. 19 Pennsbury and lead the 14th-seeded Green Raiders to victory in the postseason. He didn’t disappoint.  Bosak scored five goals, all in the first half, and dominated the face-off circle in Ridley’s 20-7 trouncing of the visiting Falcons. Ridley (11-8) will travel to No. 3 Pennridge Thursday.  “It’s been seven years since we had a home playoff game,” Bosak said. “I told the guys that this means too much for us to go down. This is the last time playing here at (Phil Marion Field) for the seniors, so we came out fired up.”  Pennsbury had no answer for Bosak, who won 21 of 25 face offs and set the tempo for the Green Raiders offense. After Michael DeZutel gave Pennsbury a 1-0 lead less than two minutes into regulation, Bosak answered to put Ridley on the board.  Bosak found the back of the net three times in a span of two minutes, 36 seconds at the end of the first half. His explosion in the waning minutes before halftime put the Green Raiders in firm control. He pulled off some sweet moves, too, juking and twisting his way to his third goal.  Kolby Ranniello tallied to cut Pennsbury’s deficit to 7-5 with 1:23 left in the second period, but all that did was anger Bosak, who won the ensuing faceoff and darted to the net to score his fourth goal. His fifth and final goal with 55 seconds to go extended Ridley’s advantage to 9-5.  “We came out in sync,” Bosak said. “I haven’t seen us have a game like this all year with this type of energy. Especially from the crowd, too.”  While Bosak was thrilled to see his teammates rise to the occasion, he didn’t mince words about his individual performance.  “I was on today,” he said. “My wingers helped me as well, but I think I was on today.”  The Green Raiders put the game out of reach when they scored five of the final six goals of the third period. They outscored the Falcons11-2 after halftime.  Luke Showalter had a huge day with four goals and two assists. Defensive middie Bobby Soper and Nate McLaughlin, the backup faceoff man, got in on the fun with a goal each. Cole Wills chipped with two. Colin Wintrode excelled in net, stopping nine shots.  “Most of the year, we were in a lot of hard battles and our backups didn’t really get to play all that much,” Bosak said. “But tonight, we gave them a chance. Everyone got involved and that was great to see.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbGNvdGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTYvZGlzdHJpY3QtMS1jbGFzcy0zYS1ib3lzLWxhY3Jvc3NlLW93ZW4tYm9zYWtzLWZpdmUtZ29hbHMtaGVscHMtcmVhd2FrZW4tcmlkbGV50gF5aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGVsY290aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8xNi9kaXN0cmljdC0xLWNsYXNzLTNhLWJveXMtbGFjcm9zc2Utb3dlbi1ib3Nha3MtZml2ZS1nb2Fscy1oZWxwcy1yZWF3YWtlbi1yaWRsZXkvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Koa Purugganan was recognized last week during the agency’s annual honorary awards celebration, which was held at Reagan National Airport in Arlington, Virginia.  Koa can be seen working regularly at LAS with 6-year-old German Shorthaired Pointer Bimbo-Boom, affectionately nicknamed “Bubba.” Koa has been a canine handler since 2019.  TSA has more than 400 canine handlers across the country who work alongside explosive detection dogs who are trained to work in busy transportation environments. Together, the handlers and dogs are a visible and effective added layer of security within the nation’s transportation system.  “We are thrilled that Koa has been recognized for the outstanding job he along with his four-legged partner Bubba do for the airport community. Koa’s commitment and leadership have made our canine operation at LAS second to none,” said TSA Federal Security Director for Nevada Karen Burke. “Koa is a team player who proactively seeks ways to improve the effectiveness of the canine program while also taking time to mentor other canine handlers to help them improve in the job they do. He and Bubba are exceptional members of our team and are deserving of this award.""  Koa has distinguished himself as a lead trainer for the local canine teams, developing multiple scenarios to test the proficiency  of the dogs and handlers in a variety of situations and locations. He has also implemented daily schedules that maximize the use of canines in screening operations and reduced “down time” for canine teams during daily work assignments.  TSA canines and handlers are most often seen at airports working in the security checkpoint, assisting with the efficiency and effectiveness of TSA’s screening operations. They are also trained to work in mass transit, commuter rail, maritime passenger ferry environments and in other busy venues supporting security operations for marquis events.  These canines are able to conduct a real-time threat assessment of travelers going through the security checkpoint. If a dog alerts its handler to the presence of explosive odor, TSA follows an established procedure to resolve the alarm.  Koa joined TSA in 2014 as a TSA officer (TSO), was later promoted to Lead TSO before being named Supervisory TSO at Kona International Airport on the Island of Hawaii. Koa transitioned to the role of canine handler and began working at LAS. Together, Koa and Bubba supported security operations at the 2022 NFL Draft in Las Vegas and have participated in Reno 911 Training. Bubba is an energetic dog who loves to come to work. When he is at home with Koa, he enjoys running around in the backyard. His favorite reward toy is anything that squeaks.  This is the not the first time the canine program at LAS has been recognized nationally. In August 2021, TSA announced that Alona, then a four-year-old Golden Retriever and explosives detection canine was the winner of the TSA “Cutest Canine” contest. Alona and her handler Vanessa continue to work at LAS.  TSA at LAS is consistently one of the busiest airports in the country, screening more than 23 million departing passengers in 2022.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRzYS5nb3YvbmV3cy9wcmVzcy9yZWxlYXNlcy8yMDIzLzA1LzE3L3RzYS1jYW5pbmUtaGFuZGxlci1yZWNvZ25pemVkLWV4Y2VwdGlvbmFsLXBlcmZvcm1hbmNlLWxlYWRlcnNoaXAtbGFz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Amazon Prime members can now add pickleball coverage to their list of membership benefits.  Amazon's Prime Video streaming platform announced Tuesday it's signed a multiyear deal with the Professional Pickleball Association for global streaming rights to four live PPA Tour events per year, including the 2023-2024 PPA Tour World Championship Series.  Amazon Prime's coverage will kick off with a four-day tournament starting Thursday from the Atlanta Open in Peachtree Corners, Georgia.  ""When something has an explosion in growth, naturally it catches our eye,"" Charlie Neiman, head of sports partnerships at Amazon Prime Video, told CNBC.  Amazon said its coverage will include games with top-ranked players such as Ben Johns, Anna Leigh Walters and Anna Bright.  Connor Pardoe, CEO and cofounder of the Pro Pickleball Association, called the deal ""monumental"" for the burgeoning league.  ""It's important for the evolution of the pro game, the game as a whole, and a nice step forward for the professional players,"" he added.  Prime's deal with the PPA also deepens its commitment to the world of sports streaming rights, which range from Thursday Night Football to emerging sports leagues and sports documentaries.  Neiman says Amazon has had tremendous success investing in other emerging properties such as MMA's One Championship or Overtime Elite Basketball. He thinks pickleball has significant growth potential as well, he said.  ""We're always looking at content and making sure our offerings on Prime Video reflect our customers' interests,"" he said.  For pickleball enthusiasts, seeing their sport on the small screen, along with the ability to stream games, is welcome news. But patchwork and evolving media strategy has also made it confusing where to watch.  The PPA Tour's 20-plus tournaments in 2023 can be seen across a variety of platforms that also includes ABC, Fox, CBS, YouTube, the Tennis Channel and FanDuel. Earlier this month, the PPA Tour announced that ESPN will cover eight of the league's tournaments.  ""Where pickleball is today, it's a sport that's really hot,"" said Pardoe. ""It's really exciting and nobody wants to miss out on it. But also, no one's really ready to commit to the whole thing as well.""  Pardoe said it will take time to get a more concise and consistent media deal, but today the league is focused on getting its brand ""anywhere and everywhere.""  Pickleball continues to see rapid growth, with an estimated 36 million people picking up a paddle between August 2021 and August 2022, according to a report by the Association of Pickleball Professionals. The sport grew more than 158% over the past three years, according to the 2023 Sports Fitness Industry Association Topline Participation Report.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTYvYW1hem9uLXByaW1lLXByb2Zlc3Npb25hbC1waWNrbGViYWxsLWFzc29jaWF0aW9uLXRvdXJuYW1lbnRzLmh0bWzSAWVodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMy8wNS8xNi9hbWF6b24tcHJpbWUtcHJvZmVzc2lvbmFsLXBpY2tsZWJhbGwtYXNzb2NpYXRpb24tdG91cm5hbWVudHMuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

However, the growth prospects of the tech industry look bright owing to growing tech dependency, the need for high-speed connectivity, and rising investments in digital transformation.  Therefore, investors could look to buy fundamentally strong internet stocks Yelp Inc. (YELP), LegalZoom.com, Inc. (LZ), and Data Storage Corporation (DTST), given their solid growth prospects.

The number of internet users in North America is forecasted to increase by 53 million users between 2023 and 2028.  The growing demand for high-speed internet connectivity drives 5G and satellite internet roll-out. The importance of high-speed and seamless connectivity in today’s world is indispensable. It is vital for companies who have migrated their operations to the cloud, fintech companies, and banks offering digital payments, streaming platforms, IoT devices, connected cars, and others.  The internet industry is being reshaped by the proliferation of IoT devices. The global Internet of Things (IoT) market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 26.1% to $3.35 trillion by 2030.

Kill Your Stereo is premiering the electric music video before its official release tomorrow. Pulling from influences as noisy and unique as Rage Against The Machine, Jeff Buckley, Royal Blood and Muse, My Hero The Homewrecker features an extravagant display of theatrics.  The video itself takes viewers on a visually stunning journey as the band plays the song out. Showcasing a dynamic and vibrant colour palette, the clip perfectly complements the raw intensity of the track.  My Hero The Homewrecker opens with a neo-classical violin intro that sets the scene, leading the way for crushing guitars and pounding drums to compliment the song’s distinctive feel.  Walter Webb has the falsetto and effortless cool of Muse’s Matt Bellamy and a bass-playing style akin to the English band’s bassist Chris Wolstenholme. The rest of the band – violinist Isaac Vincent, Angelo Webb (drums, samples) and guitarist Kalen Austin fire on all cylinders, bringing the ambitious, towering track to life.  Never miss a story! Subscribe to our newsletter Sign Up  Green and purple lights flash on the set as confetti falls during the song’s chorus. Mecha Mecha's music blurs the lines of dark indie rock and neo-classical metal, with tinges of psytrance and EDM. The unusual lineup of electric violin, bass, and drums creates a unique and electric sound that is enrapturing. Check out the music video below.  My Hero The Homewrecker follows previously released tracks from the band including Greedy Boys and Caught In A Cage. For the former, Mecha Mecha told The Music, “The song is highlighting the extended childhood the members of this band feel we have been given. Both in the support from our family and friends to pursue our music dreams, but also sort of culturally we’ve been allowed to chase a teenage dream.”  You can catch Mecha Mecha performing My Hero The Homewrecker at Moondoll Festival at Mansfield Tavern, Brisbane, on Saturday, 3 June.

Recently, astronomers utilised this telescope's cutting-edge technology to observe a distant star-forming galaxy, delving into its intricate structure with unprecedented detail.  Discovery of the Galaxy  Harnessing the capabilities of NASA's billion-dollar observatory, the James Webb Space Telescope's Orbiter Spacecraft has unveiled the stellar composition of GN20, one of the earliest-known galaxies in the universe. Situated a staggering 12 billion light years away, this captivating discovery represents a luminous and dust-laden star-forming galaxy of extraordinary brilliance.  Significance of the Galaxy  What makes GN20 particularly intriguing is its relatively recent formation, occurring a mere 1.5 billion years after the cataclysmic event known as the Big Bang. Positioned within a region of space referred to as a protocluster or galaxy overdensity, this area holds astronomers' fascination due to its eventual culmination in the formation of colossal galactic clusters.  Insights into the Galaxy's Structure  The captivating image captured by the James Webb Space Telescope allows us to peer back in time when the universe was a mere 1.5 billion years old, as it stands at approximately 13.5 million years presently. Astonishingly, this ancient galaxy boasts a star formation rate approximately 1,860 times greater than the mass of our Sun each year. Astronomers, under the guidance of Luis Colina from the Spanish Astrobiology Centre, employed the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) to examine GN20's structural properties during November 23-24, 2022.  Findings of the Study  Analysis of the MIRI images unveiled a clumpy molecular gas surrounding the galaxy, forming a colossal disk spanning about 46,000 light-years in diameter. Furthermore, the measurements indicated that the galaxy comprises a diffuse gas envelope encompassing a densely packed nucleus of shimmering stars. Remarkably, the nucleus spans a mere 2,600 light-years across, while the gaseous envelope extends approximately 23,000 light-years.  About the James Webb Space Telescope  James Webb Space Telescope stands as NASA's most prominent and powerful space science observatory. Boasting a large infrared telescope with a primary mirror of around 6.5 metres, this state-of-the-art instrument represents a monumental leap forward in our quest to understand the cosmos. It has been positioned a million miles out into space. It orbits the Sun and not the Earth.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3RlY2guaGluZHVzdGFudGltZXMuY29tL3RlY2gvbmV3cy9leHRyYW9yZGluYXJ5LWphbWVzLXdlYmItc3BhY2UtdGVsZXNjb3BlLXNuYXBzLWV4cGxvc2l2ZS1zdGFyLWJpcnRoLWFmdGVyLXRoZS1iaWctYmFuZy03MTY4NDIyMzE1MDY5OS5odG1s0gGYAWh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaC5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vYW1wL3RlY2gvbmV3cy9leHRyYW9yZGluYXJ5LWphbWVzLXdlYmItc3BhY2UtdGVsZXNjb3BlLXNuYXBzLWV4cGxvc2l2ZS1zdGFyLWJpcnRoLWFmdGVyLXRoZS1iaWctYmFuZy03MTY4NDIyMzE1MDY5OS5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

OKX is the fifth-ranked exchange, according to CoinMarketCap data with a 24-hour trading volume of $825 million, receiving 2.2 million weekly visitors.  $LHINU will list on the top decentralized exchange (DEX) Uniswap at 2 pm UTC, four hours after the OKX listing.  The top centralized exchange announcement means that Love Hate Inu is launching with maximum impact.  Checkout the OKX $LHINU listing announcement tweet.  Love Hate Inu raised $10,204,000 million in its presale, making it one of the largest crypto fundraises of the year.  Given the meme coin frenzy of the past few weeks, Love Hate Inu could not have picked a better time to launch. While many of those meme coins are already dying, Love Hate Inu has a real business model that guarantees it is here to stay.  How and when to claim $LHINU tokens  Token holders from the presale will be able to claim their coins at 9 am UTC Friday 19th, one hour before the OKX listing takes place.  To claim tokens purchased in the presale, holders simply need to connect on the Love Hate Inu website with the wallet originally used to buy the $LHINU tokens, and then click the ‘claim’ button.  The tokens will appear in the token holder’s wallet.  You can still buy $LHINU before the OKX listing – don’t miss the next Shiba Inu  For those who missed out on Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, or Pepe, this is an exceptional opportunity to capture what could be a staggering return on investment.  Love Hate Inu’s unrivaled utility sets it apart, which explains why it has become one of the hottest meme coins of the year. Crypto analysts predict 10x returns for $LHINU.  Today’s crypto investors don’t just want to chase cute Inu coins with no utility. The best crypto projects, like Love Hate Inu, are taking the utility-led approach.  The team believes that by building a great product, it will attract the users.  As such, Love Hate Inu is creating a system that is scalable so that it can onboard potentially millions of users who will want to vote in its polls.  Love Hate Inu packed with viral utility – the only vote-to-earn meme coin  In sharp contrast to many other meme coins, Love Hate Inu is packed with utility. Its primary use case is to enable community members to hold polls on any manner of subject matter.  Voting is secured by staking the $LHINU token, making the polls immune to manipulation. Voting mechanisms are an ideal use case for blockchain technology.  In addition to providing security, the blockchain’s decentralized network architecture enables voters to be rewarded for their participation through the earning of $LHINU tokens.  Users of the platform can vote on anything in the world they think worthy of a poll, from celebrities and personalities they love or loathe to whatever it is that is of trending interest on the web and beyond.  As can be seen by the examples on the project’s website, meme illustrations have been created of personalities such as Donald Trump, Elon Musk and Andrew Tate, that have viral meme qualities.  The imagery is eminently shareable, helping to achieve viral popularity.  The demo polls that the team has been running support that thesis, with huge interest being shown in the numbers taking part. Tens of thousands have taken part.  Love Hate Inu has hit on a winning formula. Precisely because the internet thrives on controversy and polarization, it means there will always be strong demand on both sides of a divide, as voters vie to get the polling outcome that puts them on the winning side.  Source / $LHINU  Love Hate Inu to transform the survey and polling industry  It is not just individual internet users that the project is targeting. Companies and nonprofits will also want to make use of the voting platform to drive brand engagement and to help organizations to reach their goals.  Again, because of the security of the platform and its ability to verify participants as real people because of the staking mechanism, the team believes the Love Hate Inu service will be particularly attractive to companies who want to conduct surveys.  The platform will also be much more accessible and efficient for companies to use than legacy systems. And Love Hate Inu is working on building a VIP onramp for companies, to encourage adoption.  CEO Carl Dawkin: “We are inserting ourselves into the internet’s big conversations”  Love Hate Inu CEO Carl Dawkins, an adviser to the UK All Party Parliamentary Group on Crypto and Digital Assets , is excited to be able to announce $LHINU’s top exchange listing.  “Everyone here at Love Hate Inu wants to extend a big thank you to everyone in our community that has helped to put our token on the map in such a big way,” said Dawkins.  “It is no accident that OKX is listing $LHINU so early in the Love Hate Inu journey, because they clearly recognize a project with potential to generate growing trading volumes.  “But ultimately Love Hate Inu is about launching a product that has the ability to appeal to a mass market audience. We are creatively inserting ourselves into the big conversations that take place across the internet every day.  For the first time people will be able to use a trusted platform with verifiable data to spin up polls on whatever they choose. Our devs are constructing a system that is superior to anything the likes of Twitter is able to offer. We are bot- and manipulation-free.  “The possibilities for the polling platform are immense. From community governance to consumer marketing, Love Hate Inu will transform the survey and polling industry.”  Basic version coming soon – “Seeing a lot of interest from brands looking at what we are doing”  Dawkins continued: “Love Hate Inu’s killer feature is vote-to-earn. None of the legacy platforms can compete with us on that. Because of that, we are already seeing a lot of interest from brands looking at what we are doing.  “You may have spotted that we are teaming up with $SPONGE, where we are taking part in their airdrop, and Web3 games platform Tamadoge that I was previously involved with – but we are also working with Web2 firms interested in using our service.  “Our platform dashboard development is progressing well. We are even looking at the possibility of getting a basic version of the platform ready at launch, with some votes on there.”  “OKX is the first of many more exchange listings. Love Hate Inu really could be the next Shiba Inu, so hold onto your hats as we rocket to the moon.”  Tune in to the Twitter Spaces AMA with Carl Dawkins  You can hear more from Carl in the Twitter Spaces AMA that took place yesterday, in which 4,200 listeners tuned in.  Including discussion of staking, exchange listings strategy, product launch schedule and much more, Dawkins also laid out some of his thoughts on marketing in response to a question about sustaining the hype.  “We have a lot of marketing we are working on as we keep doing what we’re doing – Love Hate Inu is built for the bull run. We have loads of opportunities. We will see dips but also constant spikes as we keep pushing out.  “Twitter raids, games nights on Discord, other contests, other platform partnerships. TikTok we will start attacking too. Also, every new exchange means more exposure. We have a lot of Asian holders to target. We have so many options to explore.""

"explosion","2017-04-30","Not Discerned","{""Waterloo"", ""Iowa"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 16:19:00","As Crown lawyers finished their cross-examination of Ager Hasan, his usual subdued courtroom demeanour gave way to an intense and emotional testimony.  Hasan is charged with second-degree murder in the death of his ex-girlfriend Melinda Vasilije.  While Hasan has admitted to stabbing Vasilije to death in the spring of 2017, he says she attacked him first, and he blacked out.  Throughout his first four days on the stand, Hasan spoke quietly, with the judge often asking him to speak up.  On Tuesday, Hasan raised his voice and said through tears he did not mean to kill Vasilije - showing intense emotion for the first time since the trial began.  “I should be in jail for a very long time, but I swear to god, I lost control. Convict me for life. I don’t care… but, I blacked out. Don’t try to say I did this in the right mind,” Hasan said, in part.  “I killed her, yes. I didn’t do this out of anger. I didn’t do this because we didn’t get back together. It happened because I was a [..] idiot. It’s all just hitting me.”  Hasan has admitted to stabbing Vasilije 47 times in the early hours of April 28, 2017.  According to Hasan’s previous testimony, after breaking up on April 3, the pair reconciled on the 27.  Security camera footage showed them at Hasan’s vehicle less than an hour before her death.  The footage shows Vasilije going back to her apartment while Hasan walks to his car door.  He then turns around and follows Vasilije back inside.  According to Hasan, once back in her apartment, he admitted to cheating on her during their relationship.  Hasan says at this point she attacked him with a knife. He says he remembers grabbing a knife and stabbing her twice before blacking out.  On cross-examination, Crown attorney Brendan Thomas directed a barrage of questions at Hasan.  “You treated her bad? You cheated on her? You gave her an STI and didn’t tell her? You tried to make her think she was responsible for it? You refused to get treatment? You never told her because you didn’t want to lose the relationship?” Thomas asked.  Hasan answered “yes” to each question.  He was then asked by Thomas: “You were desperate to get her back, you were obsessed, you lied and tried to manipulate her, you said anything to meet with her in person, and you finally got what you wanted?”  He was also asked: “Your one moment of honesty came just before you killed Melinda?”  Court then saw the text Hasan sent Vasilije an hour after her death.  It reads: “Nice seeing you tonight glad we worked things out!! You better have deleted that [..] lol. Anyways see you soon.”  According to Hasan, he sent the message because he thought it might make the police think it wasn't him invovled.  The crown then showed an email sent by Hasan to a Waterloo regional police officer nearly two months after the stabbing  In it, Hasan writes in part: “I’m considering turning myself in, before I do I need you to do something for me. I need you to answer a few questions for me, I know you don’t have to but I will be willing to turn myself in, but I need the answers to these questions first.  He then goes on to say: My first question is, did Melinda ever sleep with anyone else in the course of our relationship (cheat) or not? After we broke up in (sic) April 3 did Melinda ever go on a date between then and April 28? Also did she ever sleep with anyone during the course of that time (sic).”  “If I get the answers I will turn myself in, hopefully before her birthday on June 28.""  The Crown has portrayed Hasan as extremely insecure and obsessed with the idea that Vasilije was cheating on him.  They say this email shows he was still dwelling on it 51 days after he killed her.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8va2l0Y2hlbmVyLmN0dm5ld3MuY2EvZXhwbG9zaXZlLXRlc3RpbW9ueS1hcy1hZ2VyLWhhc2FuLXRyaWFsLW5lYXJzLWNvbmNsdXNpb24tMS42NDAwNjM00gFEaHR0cHM6Ly9iZXRhLmN0dm5ld3MuY2EvbG9jYWwva2l0Y2hlbmVyLzIwMjMvNS8xNi8xXzY0MDA2MzQuYW1wLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Luis “Louie” Ruelas threatened to “f–king bury” people in the explosive trailer for Bravo’s “Teresa Gets Married” special. Bravo  The trailer sees Teresa Giudice breaking down in tears amid her drama with brother Joe Gorga and his wife, Melissa Gorga. Bravo  After breaking down in tears, a woeful Giudice, 50, seems to be talking about her estranged brother when she says, “I just don’t want his name brought up.”  Meanwhile, the “Turning the Tables” author’s eldest daughter, Gia Giudice, suggests that her entire family’s relationship with the Gorgas is all but finished.  “It’s over for everybody — including me and my sisters,” Gia, 22, says in a confessional.  The Gorgas skipped the Aug. 6, 2022, nuptials. Charles Sykes/Bravo  The drama between Teresa and the Gorgas hit its apex in the summer of 2022 after the “Real Housewives of New Jersey” OG brought up rumors that Melissa, 44, cheated on Joe, 47, with longtime friend Nick Barrotta.  A source previously told Page Six the Gorgas — who have been married since 2004 and share three children — “laughed off” the claims.  For more Page Six reality TV updates  Melissa — who, with Joe, subsequently decided to skip Teresa and Ruelas’ Aug. 6, 2022 wedding — later said on her “On Display” podcast, “Sometimes when things are too toxic and you try over and over and over again and it just keeps coming back around to the same thing, even if it’s family, you have to let it go.”  Giudice’s drama with the Gorgas hit its apex in the summer of 2022 as production for “The Real Housewives of New Jersey” Season 13 was winding down. melissagorga/Instagram  Teresa’s longtime frenemy Margaret Josephs, who is close with the Gorgas, attended the wedding, but seemingly felt uncomfortable attending — as she notes in the preview.  “All I can think of is we’re all here and Melissa and Joe are not,” she tells co-stars Jackie Goldschneider and Jennifer Fessler.  Despite the volatile turn of events, there are lighthearted moments expected to play out in “Teresa Gets Married.”  Giudice’s four daughters served as bridesmaids. Charles Sykes/Bravo  Giudice’s co-stars Dolores Catania and Jennifer Aydin were also part of the bridal party. Charles Sykes/Bravo  Several of Teresa’s “Real Housewives” friends — including “Dubai” star Chanel Ayan, “Potomac” star Ashley Darby, “New York City” star Dorinda Medley and “Atlanta” star Kenya Moore — make cameos.  “I love a Jersey wedding,” Medley, 58, says at one point.  Teresa’s infamous wedding hair is also highlighted, though her pal and bridesmaid Jennifer Aydin seems uncertain about the elaborate $10,000 style.  “Hair’s supposed to be an accent piece, not the main event,” Aydin, 46, quips in a confessional.  “Teresa Gets Married” premieres Tuesday, May 23, at 8 p.m. ET on Bravo.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vcGFnZXNpeC5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8xNi9sdWlzLXJ1ZWxhcy10aHJlYXRlbnMtdG8tYnVyeS1wZW9wbGUtaW4tdGVyZXNhLWdldHMtbWFycmllZC_SAV9odHRwczovL3BhZ2VzaXguY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTYvbHVpcy1ydWVsYXMtdGhyZWF0ZW5zLXRvLWJ1cnktcGVvcGxlLWluLXRlcmVzYS1nZXRzLW1hcnJpZWQvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"explosion","2023-05-10","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 00:01:52","A suspect stole up to $2,000 in tools from a truck from the 100 block of Buena Vista Drive in Sonoma between 3 and 4 a.m. on May 13, according to Sonoma Police Chief Brandon Cutting.  The victim called police the next morning. Deputies observed video footage from the night before and saw the suspect cut open the toolbox in the truck bed, Cutting said.  Police are still investigating the incident.  ‘Explosion’ at high school  Sonoma police responded to a reported “explosion” at Sonoma Valley High School on Wednesday, May 10, likely stemming from a pyrotechnic device, Sonoma Police Chief Brandon Cutting said.  As deputies were responding to the incident, a fire alarm went off on another side of campus, but police are unsure if the two incidents were related, Cutting said. No evidence of an explosion was found on site, and no student could be identified.  No damage was reported and the incident is being handled by school officials, Cutting said.  Petty theft  As a Sonoma woman entered Whole Foods on May 10 around 4 p.m., she was confronted by a group of three strangers who worked together to steal her purse, Cutting said.  One of the suspects approached the woman and asked her for directions to Sonoma Valley Hospital while the other two took her purse, which contained credit cards and about $100 in cash, Cutting said. The cards were charged $500 shortly after at a nearby ATM.  Sonoma police believe the group is a part of a known theft ring in the Bay Area which previously stole items from Halem & Co. jewelry store, Cutting said. There are no leads at this point.  Hit and run  On May 13, Sonoma police responded to a reported hit and run on the 19000 block of Robinson Road.  Video footage near the incident showed a driver hit a parked Honda and continue driving. Deputies found the suspect’s unoccupied car near Verano Avenue and Main Street the next day, but were unable to find the driver, Cutting said.  Sonoma police are still searching for the suspect.  DUI  Police responded to a reported hit and run at 7:22 a.m. in the area of First Street West and Spain Street in downtown Sonoma on May 13.  A witness followed the suspect’s Nissan Xterra and called police, who quickly located the driver and conducted a traffic stop, Cutting said.  Deputies determined the 37-year-old Sonoma man was under the influence of alcohol. Deputies conducted a Breathalyzer test that showed the suspect had a BAC of 0.27 — more than three times the legal limit, Cutting said.  The suspect was arrested for misdemeanor DUI and hit and run, Cutting said.

"explosion","2023-09-16","Not Discerned","{""NotreDame"", ""Indiana"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 22:41:15","You don’t often see a player lock in his commitment date before setting any of his official visits, but that’s the case with Bellflower (Calif.) St. John Bosco defensive back Jason Mitchell. Mitchell has several schools on his list and plans to take at least five if not more official trips this cycle. It sounds like many of those trips will come after he makes his decision.  We had a chance to catch up with Mitchell last week at the Braves College Showcase and he updated us on where his recruitment is at right now.  “I’m still set to commit Sept. 16 at the Kahuku (Hawaii) game,” Mitchell said. “I plan to take a few official trips in June and then the rest will be during the season.  “I think I’ll be able to take a few in-season before the Kahuku game and then I’ll do a few after that. You only go through this once and I really want to enjoy the recruiting process so I want to try and take as many trips as I can.”  The schools Mitchell mentioned who he’s hoping to visit include LSU, Notre Dame, Oregon, USC, Utah and Washington. He talked about what stands out with each program:  LSU: “LSU likes me as a corner and that’s where I enjoy playing. I’ll play anywhere but I like corner and LSU is one of those schools like Oregon and USC that I would call a childhood favorite. I always liked them growing up, they produce great defensive backs every year and get them drafted. I like their style of play, the SEC is a great conference so I’m excited to visit there on a game weekend.”  Notre Dame: “Notre Dame is on me really heavy and they’re recruiting me as an athlete right now. They feel I can play corner or safety and haven’t specified exactly where they like me, they said they just me and they’ll find a spot once I get there. I know a lot will depend on my frame and how big I get but I see a lot of opportunity at Notre Dame. They have a great staff in place with a great head coach who knows defense really well. I like how they’re recruiting me, and so, I’m excited for my visit and we still need to decide if that will in June or during the season.”  Oregon: “Oregon feels a lot like L.A .(Los Angeles) to me. I don’t mean the city as much as the people there. They have a lot of coaches that are from here and when I talk to them, it feels like home for sure. I love the vibe and the way I feel when I’m with those guys. They’re good coaches and quality people and I’ve always loved the Oregon program a lot.”  USC: “I mean, it’s USC. What else can I say? It’s the school I grew up watching, my dad played there, so I’ve always followed them. It’s a childhood favorite, but still, I have to pick the best school for me, not just who I liked when I was young. It’s a business decision, but saying that, I do like USC a lot and I’m really close with (defensive backs coach and defensive passing game coordinator) Donte (Williams) and the rest of the staff.”  Utah: “I’m going to visit Utah for sure during the season and the coaches gave me their schedule and I just have to pick a game. I love that staff and they show a lot of love. I talk with (special teams coordinator and cornerbacks) coach (Sharrieff) Shah, (defensive coordinator and safeties) coach (Morgan) Scalley, (head) coach (Kyle) Whit(tingham), and everyone there is so real and genuine. There’s nothing but great people at Utah and they’re all about development, so I really like them a lot.”  Get the latest football and basketball transfer portal news from 247Sports.  Washington: “I visited Washington with California Power (7v7 team) and loved it there. I like the coaching staff and the support system they have in place. It’s a great staff with (cornerbacks) coach (Julius) Juice (Brown) and (co-defensive coordinator and safeties) coach (Chuck) Morrell and I talk with (director of player personnel) Courtney Morgan, too. (Head) coach (Kalen) DeBoer, he’s a great guy and he’s building something special. He put together a great season in his fist year there and that showed me a lot.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vMjQ3c3BvcnRzLmNvbS9jb2xsZWdlL3dhc2hpbmd0b24vYXJ0aWNsZS93YXNoaW5ndG9uLWh1c2tpZXMtZm9vdGJhbGwtcmVjcnVpdGluZy1leHBsb3NpdmUtMjAyNi1vYWtzLWNocmlzLTIxMDMwODU1Ny_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"explosion","2017-05-10","Not Discerned","{""Omaha"", ""Nebraska"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 23:30:00","Alex Draper had a huge day at the plate to keep Platteview alive in the Class C state tournament, while Omaha Gross had a well-balanced effort to get a win over Beatrice in B.  Omaha Gross 5, Beatrice 2  Beatrice got on the board first on an RBI single by pitcher Deagan Nelson, but the Cougars capitalized on a couple of errors to take a 3-1 lead in the second inning. Colby Duncan reached first base on an error that scored Carson Almgren as Duncan collided with the Orangemen first baseman.  Owen Brennan then drove a fly ball to deep right, as Joshua Buhr made a good adjustment in right for the out, but Alex Kosse scored easily from third, and on an error on the throw to home, Duncan also scored.  An RBI single by Colby Duncan provided an insurance run in the top of the sixth.  ""We got some big at-bats,"" Gross head coach Jim Hempel said, after the Cougars followed a 13-run performance with five on Tuesday.  ""One through nine here for these last few games, we've had guys really locked in and they've been having good ABs. We talked about if we don't strike out, we put the ball in play, and hit a few hard, we're gonna win a lot of games because our defense is good and our pitching has been really good this year.""  Starting pitcher Joseph Rempe was pulled after 5.1 innings of one-run ball for Jack Miller with two runners on and one out in the bottom of the inning.  ""We told Joe we had to have him go deep into this game,"" Hempel said. ""He hadn't thrown this whole week, and he went out and gave us everything he had, just gutted it out. (He) gave up that early run and then just settled in which, that's been his career. He's beaten a lot of big teams over the last two years.""  Using a ""very manageable"" curveball, Rempe commanded the zone and put the Cougars in a position for Miller to come in and finish the win.  After getting a strikeout, Miller induced the final out to keep the Cougars lead at 4-1.  An Almgren sacrifice fly added some room to the Gross lead, but the drama didn’t end there in the seventh.  On a play at the plate, Rempe trucked into the Beatrice catcher Noah Jobman after running through third on a single to left, and was tossed from the game, igniting some shouts from both benches but without escalating further.  Rempe will miss the first game but not the second (if necessary) against Elkhorn North tomorrow.  ""Curious to see some video of that. So I wasn't real happy about that. I understand the out call but the ejection I thought was a little questionable with the catcher coming up the line in a split second. You don't have any options. You're gonna have contact in a play like that. So it's unfortunate that we will lose him for the first game.""  Miller shut the door in the bottom of the inning for a second straight Cougars win to earn his school record-tying fourth save of the season.  ""We didn't want anybody else out there other than Joe and then Jack Miller does what Jack does. He tied coach Peters' spring record for saves, and that was his fourth one today, and he's been wanting to get on the big board up at school, so that would be able to get him on. So he's pretty excited about that.""  Omaha Gross next plays Elkhorn North on Wednesday at 10 a.m. back at Fricke Field. A loss to the Wolves would end the season, while a win would set up a win-or-go-home for both teams, the winner advancing to the Class B state championship game on Friday at Tal Anderson Field at 4 p.m.  Om. Gross (17-7) … 030 001 1 – 5 6 0  Beatrice (15-10) ….. 100 000 1 – 1 5 2  Platteview 12, Conc./BT/OCA 1 (6 inn.)  A bases-clearing double and three-run homer by Alex Draper provided the bulk of the offense for the Trojans in their second win of the state tournament to advance to face Malcolm for a second time at Millard North on Wednesday at 4 p.m.  After Draper emptied the bases in the second, Dezmond Straatman drove in two more with a single to right in the third, and the lead ballooned to seven as Draper was hit by pitch with the bases loaded.  Draper was then driven in on a sac fly by Nathan Thomas, and another from Keegan Stobbe scored the Trojans ninth run of the game.  The senior Trojan then effectively hit a walk-off three-run shot to right to earn Platteview a mercy-rule win.

Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources , and more. Learn More .  Over the last 20 years, growth stocks have handed shareholders some of the best returns that the stock market has to offer.  Take Amazon, for example. A £10,000 stake in 2003 would have surged 10,079% to become over a million at today’s share price.  While that’s hardly typical, it does show what’s possible. And there are two stocks I own that I think have the potential to shoot up in the coming years.  Games Workshop  The first stock I’m excited about is tabletop gaming company Games Workshop (LSE: GW). Its share price has already grown over 20 times from £4.23 to £98.30 inside the last decade.  This growth shows what a good job it’s been doing building its brand. In fact, from 2016 to 2022:  Revenue increased from £118m to £414m  Margins increased from 11% to 31%  Net income increased from £13m to £128m  The total market cap grew to £3.2bn from only £161m  A Henry Cavill TV series  As impressive as all that is, I think it might just be the start here. As what’s really exciting is the potential of its Warhammer intellectual property.  Other fictional worlds like Star Wars, Marvel or Lord of the Rings have had outrageously successful – and lucrative – TV shows and movies.  And only last year, Amazon struck a deal with the firm to create a Warhammer series starring Henry Cavill. If that goes on to have success like those other big franchises, then I’d expect my Games Workshop shares to move much higher.  It’s worth mentioning that the show hasn’t even been filmed yet, so any success is not at all guaranteed.  Tesla  My second choice, electric vehicles (EV) manufacturer Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), needs little introduction.  The carmaker has already grown at a 40% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the last 10 years. That’s thanks to its success in producing desirable EVs, taking a 65% share of that market.  But its success does present an obvious question: is the growth phase already over?  Musk’s latest vision  Personally, I don’t think so. And the reason is its owner Elon Musk has a much grander vision. He wants Tesla to put self-driving vehicles on roads all around the world.  The company that introduces safe and effective autonomous vehicles will surely see huge growth. It’s like creating the same productivity as millions of taxis and lorry drivers in one fell swoop.  And Tesla looks well placed here. First off, the firm’s vertical integration – making its own batteries, having its own repairs, and the like – means the company trounces its competitors when it comes to margins.  Tesla Toyota Honda GM Ford Stellantis 2022 Net Margin 15.5% 6.9% 4.80% 6.20% -1.4% 9.2%  That’s a lot more cash to spend on research and testing its autonomous vehicles.  But also, Musk’s latest move was to slash thousands off the prices of his cars. By doing this, he thinks Tesla can gain further market share to give itself an untouchable advantage in self-driving technology.  For me, the biggest risk here is simply that other investors agree with me. Today’s share price of $172 bumps the price-to-earnings ratio up to an expensive-sounding 50.  But even at that price, I think Tesla can join Games Workshop on my list of stocks that I’m extremely bullish about for their future growth potential.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY28udWsvMjAyMy8wNS8xNy8yLWdyb3d0aC1zdG9ja3MtdGhhdC1taWdodC1leHBsb2RlLWluLXRoZS1uZWFyLWZ1dHVyZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

While the pair returned to screens this week to host This Morning, reports have been circulating that Holly is looking to pull the plug on their TV partnership. On Monday, the stars managed to present the show with a smile, but many viewers spotted tension under the surface. But what are Holly and Phil actually rowing about and when did it begin? READ MORE: Holly and Phil's ‘awkward’ snap highlights backstage 'tension'  Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield returned to This Morning  After first working together back in 2006, Holly and Phillip have been best friends ever since. But despite appearing on the ITV daytime show together, reports surfaced the pair were ""barely speaking"" off camera. According to The Sun, following the ""Queue-gate"" scandal last year, Holly made it clear to ITV bosses that she would continue to host the show even if Phil leaves. It comes after the This Morning hosts faced backlash after thousands of mourners had to wait for up to 24 hours to pay their last respects to Her Majesty amid claims the presenters had skipped the queue.  Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield are close pals  Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield present Dancing On Ice  In a special pre-recorded message at the time, Holly and Phil said they ""would never skip the queue"" and were given special broadcast access. Reports later suggested their friendship had ""cooled off"" in recent months. Last week a source told The Sun that while they are ""putting on smiles"" for the show, there are ""naturally some tensions"". “This has been brewing quietly for some time"", the source told the publication: ""But now it’s all out in the open and people are talking about it. There is no getting past it.""  Holly Willoughby joined This Morning in 2006  Following these reports, Phillip released a statement to the same publication where he referred to Holly as his ""best friend"". It read: “As I have said before, Holly is my rock. We’re the best of friends — as always, she is an incredible support on screen, behind the scenes and on the phone. ""Holly has always been there for me, through thick and thin. And I’ve been there for her. The last few weeks haven’t been easy for either of us.” After Phillip released a statement regarding his friendship with Holly, calling her his ""rock"", sources claimed the mother-of-three was ""blindsided"" by the message which she knew nothing about.

Researching minute occurrences and bringing new insights lie within the prime focus of my task.  Story Highlights Bitcoin price is heavily consolidating within a very narrow range, allowing the other cryptos to intensify their pace and rise high.  Besides, some of the altcoins like Polkadot appear to be preparing for a massive explosion that may raise the levels beyond a 2-digit figure.  The crypto space is maintaining a choppy trend as the prices of the major tokens have been hovering within a very narrow range. Besides, one of the popular altcoins is displaying acute strength as it has been accumulating for the past few weeks. The Polkadot price is currently testing one of the crucial supports and is believed to rebound and reach a 2-digit figure soon.  The Polkadot price, similar to the other tokens within the markets, has maintained a healthy upswing since the beginning of the year. After the remarkable drop, the price is now heading towards the critical levels that may offer a required bounce to rebound and rise above the bearish influence.  DOT price currently appears to be in a group of leaders who are primed to break out from the prolonged downward trend. After a 2-month rise, the Polkadot price surged by nearly 100% and quickly dropped into a deep consolidation for the 3rd month. Therefore, the DOT price cannot continue to fall until it holds the critical levels at $4.83.  Moreover, if Elliot wave analysis is done on the current trade setup, then wave 2 is very close to completion. Therefore, the next wave could be an upward wave that may lift the price towards the upper targets at around $10 to $10.5 initially.

The incident occurred on May 1, around midnight, when a fire erupted in a housewares store situated in a building adjacent to D Mart.  The deceased has been identified as Sameer Ashok Kolte.

They described the rush to leave Sudan, which involved destroying documents and lowering the flag.  Top editors give you the stories you want — delivered right to your inbox each weekday.

Christopher Wolfert watched plumes of smoke rising in the distance amid the booms of exploding mortars and cracks of machine-gun fire in Sudan's capital.  It was Saturday, April 22. The US Marine Security Guard was protecting the American embassy in Khartoum, which had been engulfed by deadly violence for a week at that point. As the situation deteriorated, the Pentagon dispatched Special Operations Forces to evacuate US diplomatic staff in a dramatic helicopter operation. A little under 100 people were rescued from the US embassy compound in just under an hour on the ground.  As Navy SEALs and Army Special Forces rushed in, Sudan's capital was spiraling toward civil war. Tensions between rival powers had finally boiled over, and street fights raged.  ""It was audible and visual,"" Wolfert later said, referring to the fighting nearby. ""The evacuation itself — fairly surreal.""  Wolfert is one of a dozen Marines whose detachment was assigned to guard the US embassy in Africa's third-largest country and one of three Marines that Insider spoke to, along with an official from the Diplomatic Security Service, an agency under the State Department, about the April 22 drawdown and evacuation of America's diplomatic outpost in Sudan.  The men Insider spoke with described scenes of chaos outside the embassy walls and a rush inside to quickly close up shop and get out of Sudan, from destroying sensitive national security information to lowering the American flag. It wasn't what anyone had wanted to see happen.  ""Unfortunately, we really didn't have a choice,"" Staff Sgt. Derek Ferrari, the detachment commander, told Insider. ""When it was time to leave, it was time to leave.""  Smoke is seen in Khartoum, Sudan, Wednesday, April 19, 2023. AP Photo/Marwan Ali, File  Fighting in Sudan first broke out on April 15 when clashes erupted between forces loyal to Gen. Abdel Fattah al Burhan, commander of the Sudanese army, and Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, who leads the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The two have been competing for power ever since they orchestrated a 2021 military coup together.  Within days, violence quickly gripped the country, killing hundreds of people and injuring thousands more. Foreign governments began efforts to pull out their diplomatic staff and, in some cases, also moved to evacuate their civilians.  At one point, armed fighters even opened fire on a clearly marked US embassy convoy that had identification plates and an American flag. No one was hurt, but Secretary of State Antony Blinken slammed the incident as ""reckless"" and ""irresponsible."" By April 20, US forces had been deployed to positions near Sudan in case they had to quickly extract diplomatic staff.  Though there were signs, the Marines didn't know for sure an evacuation was coming, but it's something that they were ready for. It is something they prepare and train for. ""It's not likely to happen,"" Ferrari said. ""But you need to be ready if it does.""  A symbolic moment  Marine Security Guards are a 24-hour presence at US embassies around the world, and their mission is to protect classified information, US government personnel, and the physical facility. At any given diplomatic post, the Marines work under regional security officers (RSOs) from the Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) — the ambassador's security and law enforcement advisors.  The Marine Security Guard Detachment assigned to the US Embassy in Khartoum, Sudan, stand for a photo in front of McMaugh Hall at Marine Corps Embassy Security Group Headquarters, Quantico, Va., on April 24. US Marine Corps courtesy photo  ""We could not do what we do overseas without Marine Security Guards,"" DSS Deputy Assistant Director Thad Osterhout told Insider. Marine Sgt. Nicholas Bonasera said ""they take care of us as we take care of them.""  Security officers train to handle a wide range of scenarios, such as intruders at the embassy, medical issues, and bomb threats, as well as emergency embassy evacuations and shutdowns.  ""There are some things that are out of your control,"" Ferrari said, but this is why they train. When the Marines learned the embassy had to be evacuated, they sprang into action to start shutting it down.  A flag-lowering ceremony takes place at the US embassy in Khartoum before it is evacuated. Gen. David H. Berger via Twitter  One order of business was lowering the American flag. All the Marines who weren't occupied with other security-related jobs at the moment took part in a ceremony that involved lowering the flag and presenting it to the ambassador, John Godfrey.  ""The American flag represents our footprint in that country and everything that the American people are bringing to that country through our diplomatic channels,"" Ferrari said. ""There's symbolism in lowering the flag.""  A flag-lowering ceremony at the US embassy in Khartoum. Gen. David H. Berger via Twitter  Getting people as violence gripped the capital  Before the evacuation could take place, all the diplomatic staff had to be consolidated at the embassy, which is one large compound protected by a wall. But US government personnel were scattered several miles away across Khartoum in a separate main housing compound and several auxiliary compounds.  Osterhout said DSS special agents had to slip outside the embassy and rescue people as fighting raged throughout the city. Sometimes, they had to wait until a safe window opened up so they could move people back to the embassy. In other cases, agents had to make multiple attempts to retrieve people who were staying temporarily at hotels.  People walk by a house hit in recent fighting in Khartoum, Sudan, Tuesday, April 25, 2023. AP Photo/Marwan Ali  Consolidating everyone in one location ""was critically important for our Department of Defense partners,"" Osterhout said. ""Had the DOD evacuation force had to go to more than one location in a city under the conditions Khartoum was in, [it] would've both complicated their planning and execution, but it also would've entailed significantly more risk.""  Outside the embassy walls, there was a lot of confusion on the ground, with poor command and control from the top down on behalf of both warring parties. Osterhout said that while the US was ""confident"" the embassy would not be specifically targeted by senior leadership on either side, there was no assurance that local fighters would avoid this.  DSS Deputy Assistant Director Thad Osterhout (far right) and other DSS leadership, alongside interagency partners, closely monitored the departure from Khartoum from the DSS Command Center in Arlington, VA on April 22, 2023 US Department of State photo  Moving about Khartoum meant traveling in a contested environment, one in which an American could easily end up in the wrong place at the wrong time. At least two Americans have been killed since the fighting began.  Osterhout said there were ""significant concerns"" that low-level forces may seize an opportunity to hold up an embassy convoy or try to gain access to a housing compound, rather than the embassy itself. Osterhout said the embassy is a ""very hard target"" because the Marines guarding the facility are a ""very effective deterrent.""  During the evacuation preparations, the Marines had to protect the national security information at the embassy, which meant safeguarding and destroying sensitive equipment and classified information. Doing this meant balancing available manpower because the Marines had to continue guarding the building like they would normally on a round-the-clock basis and also staff various security posts.  Though fighting was happening in the immediate vicinity of the embassy, neither the Sudanese army nor the RSF were intentionally trying to attack the embassy, Ferrari said. Still, there was a lot of indirect fire and ordnance being thrown around in the surrounding areas.  ""You could see and smell and hear everything around you that could at any time ... have been a great threat to the embassy, whether it was intentional or unintentional,"" he added.  Evacuating the embassy  Fighting like this can always threaten air operations, but when President Joe Biden gave the orders to evacuate the embassy in Khartoum, it signaled that Washington was willing to take that risk.  At 9 a.m. EST on April 22, three MH-47 Chinook rotary aircraft took off from Djibouti and stopped to refuel in neighboring Ethiopia before flying another three hours to Khartoum. As is standard practice for diplomatic outposts, the embassy had a pre-designated landing zone in an open field around 500 feet outside the southern entrance to the compound.  Even as the evacuation unfolded, the Marines were constantly busy conducting their standard operating procedures, as they had been since the moment the conflict broke out. They manned the security posts until the very last hour, at which point they had to be shut down.  DSS Deputy Assistant Director Thad Osterhout (far left) and other DSS leadership, alongside interagency partners, closely monitored the departure from Khartoum from the DSS Command Center in Arlington, VA on April 22, 2023. US Department of State photo  Physically moving dozens of personnel from the embassy to the helicopters fell entirely on the responsibility of the more than 100 US troops — all Special Operations Forces — who had flown into Khartoum that day. Once the Marines and diplomatic staff were loaded up onto the helicopters, the mission was complete.  ""The evacuation was conducted in one movement via rotary wing,"" Lt. Gen. D.A. Sims, director of operations for the Joint Staff, told reporters later that day. ""The operation was fast and clean, with service members spending less than an hour on the ground in Khartoum.""  The Marines said that departing Sudan was a ""bittersweet"" moment. There was a sense of sadness to leave behind their Sudanese colleagues and the friends they had made in the country, yet there was also a feeling of satisfaction in knowing that they did their duties.  ""Even though it's seems like we're leaving our diplomatic footprint behind in Sudan, we were leaving with all the personnel that we were supposed to,"" Ferrari noted. ""No one had been killed, no one had been seriously injured, everybody had been evacuated safely. So that is a successful mission as a whole — that is something that no one should be sad or upset about.""  ""Our job is to protect the embassy,"" Wolfert said. ""We had done our jobs well.""  US Mission personnel assigned to the US Embassy in Khartoum, Sudan, embrace each other upon their safe return to the United States at Dulles International Airport, Va., on April 24. US Marine Corps courtesy photo  With the embassy staff gone, questions remained over whether Washington would move to evacuate US citizens, as some other Western nations had been doing. At one point, the State Department and the Pentagon organized a land convoy — with drone support overhead — to bring Americans to a part city along the Red Sea, where they could then travel onward to Saudi Arabia. Naval support had also been moved into the region.  Meanwhile, fighting in Sudan shows no signs of slowing down, and civilians continue to pay the ultimate price. According to United Nations estimates, over 600 people have been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have either become internally displaced or fled the country.  Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organization, warned last week that the violence is crippling the country at an economic and social level.  ""As well as facing shelling and insecurity, people are dealing with dwindling supplies of water, food, medicines, and electricity,"" he said. ""Establishing safe routes for humanitarian aid is critical. But the ultimate solution is peace.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vZXZhY3VhdGlvbi11cy1lbWJhc3N5LXN1ZGFuLXN1cnJvdW5kZWQtZ3Vucy1leHBsb3Npb25zLXN0cmVldC1maWdodGluZy0yMDIzLTXSAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL2V2YWN1YXRpb24tdXMtZW1iYXNzeS1zdWRhbi1zdXJyb3VuZGVkLWd1bnMtZXhwbG9zaW9ucy1zdHJlZXQtZmlnaHRpbmctMjAyMy01P2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

After years of explosive growth during the pandemic, Home Depot’s revenue during the first quarter fell short of expectations and the company cut its profit and sales outlook for the year, sending shares skidding before the opening bell Tuesday.  It was a rough start to a busy week of retail earnings and the numbers from the nation’s biggest home improvement chain dragged down retails stocks as well as the Dow.  Advertisement  For the three months ended April 30, revenue dropped to $37.26 billion from last year’s $38.91 billion, and it was short of the $38.45 billion projected by analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research.  Sales at stores open at least a year, a key indicator of a retailer’s health, dropped 4.5%, and it dropped 4.6% for stores in the U.S.  Advertisement  “After a three-year period of unprecedented growth for our sector, during which we grew sales by over $47 billion, we expected that fiscal 2023 would be a year of moderation for the home improvement market,” said CEO Ted Decker.  Decker said weak sales were mostly due to lumber deflation and bad weather, particularly in its Western division which had to contend with extreme weather in California.  But the Atlanta company cut its expectations for the year with as shift in spending becomes more clear with the economy slowing and costs rising for builders and homeowners.  The U.S. Federal Reserve has hiked benchmark interest rates 10 consecutive times with hopes of slowing the economy and cooling inflation.  The U.S. economy slowed sharply from January through March, decelerating to just a 1.1% annual pace as higher interest rates hammered the housing market and businesses reduced their inventories. An estimate from the Commerce Department last month showed that the nation’s gross domestic product — the broadest gauge of economic output — weakened after growing 3.2% from July through September and 2.6% from October through December.  Home Depot cautioned in February that it expected profits to slip this year. The chain saw remarkable growth over the past three years, as many people hunkered down at home or were searching for a new home during the pandemic. Americans spent heavily on home renovations and other projects.  With the easing of the pandemic, Americans began to spend on things that had faded in recent years, like dinners out and vacations.  Home Depot earned $3.87 billion, or $3.82 per share, in the quarter. A year earlier it earned $4.23 billion, or $4.09 per share. That was better than the per-share earnings of $3.80 that industry analysts were expecting.  Advertisement  Home Depot Inc. now expects sales and same-store sales to decline between 2% and 5% this year. Several months ago, the company said it expected sales to be flat compared with 2022.  The chain now expects full-year earnings to fall between 7% and 13%, expanding the potential decline from earlier expectations that the retreat would remain solidly in the single-digit percentage range.  Shares dropped more than 3% before the market open on Tuesday.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoaWNhZ290cmlidW5lLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9jdC1iaXotaG9tZS1kZXBvdC1yZXZlbnVlLTIwMjMwNTE2LXJ0a2YzZW1xazVnenhkZWFtdnNlYm12a2VlLXN0b3J5Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

For context, it was at that time that bands like ESG and Liquid Liquid existed at the forefront of the Disco Punk frontier, mixing No Wave, Disco and Post-Punk sounds to craft an entirely new genre for music. DJ Kool Herc, meanwhile, was building the foundation for breakdancing, and Blondie had just put out Parallel Lines.  In the art scene, Keith Haring had just set up shop in the Lower East Side, while Jean-Michel Basquiat and Al Diaz were tagging Manhattan under their SAMO alter-ego. “It was a mythical time for art and music in the city,” as the brand puts it.  Referencing the era through clothes, YMC is celebrating ’70s New York’s breakthroughs with clashing colors, military surplus references and arty prints. Cotton ripstop, leaf print camouflages and field jackets in soft twill nod to the army-inspired silhouettes of the time, while shirting appears inspired by Basquiat’s legendary works. The color palette, which largely consists of washed blue, black, ecru, red, brown and royal blue, is just as much a sign of the times.  The brand’s signature pieces, like the Bowie shirt, arrive with fresh New York-inspired patterns. The PJ Overshirt is made from a delicate Broaderie Anglais; the Walker Jacket enlists a pre-washed dye, and the Battle Jacket dons a military-inspired brown facade. Clashing colors, as mentioned, appear in stripes on the Bluebird Dress and Rat Pack Cardigan, referencing the “anarchic spirit” that defined the period.

Explosion of a missile is seen in the sky over the city during a Russian missile strike in Kyiv, Ukraine May 16, 2023.  Kyiv was targeted by 18 different missiles in a “pretty intense” attack overnight, according to Ukraine – but officials managed to shoot them all down.  According to the country’s authorities, at least three people were injured in the assault from both drones and missiles.  It came just as Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy concluded his European tour where he was asking Western allies for greater military support against Russia – and received substantial pledges for more funding and equipment.  The first air raid alert went off at 2.30am local time (11.30pm GMT) and only ceased two hours later.  This was the eighth time the capital has been targeted by missiles this month alone, following a 50-day pause on the attacks.  Moscow has increased its attacks against Ukraine in recent weeks while bracing itself for Kyiv’s counteroffensive.  But, this series of missiles was particularly devastating, because Kyiv was attacked from the north, south and east with 18 air, sea and land-based missiles.  Miraculously though, no fatalities have been reported yet.  Still, as the British ambassador to Ukraine, Dame Melinda Simmons, tweeted: “A full on aerial attack on Kyiv last night, pretty intense.  “Bangs and shaking walls are not an easy night. Hope everyone is OK.”  A full on aerial attack on Kyiv last night, pretty intense. Bangs and shaking walls are not an easy night. Hope everyone is ok. — Dame Melinda Simmons (@MelSimmonsFCDO) May 16, 2023  The head of the Ukrainian capital’s military administration, Serhiy Popko, also said the attack was “the maximum number of attack missiles in the shortest period of time”.  But, he said “preliminary information” shows most of these were “destroyed”, leaving rocket debris across the city.  Story continues  Six of the missiles were allegedly Kinzhal hypersonic missiles – those which exceed the speed of sound by five times – which Moscow previously claimed could not be defeated by any air defence system.  Officials think Moscow wants to exhaust Ukraine’s air defence systems through its barrage of attacks.  Here’s a round-up of what the overnight attack looked like in photos:  The picture shows an explosion over Kyiv during a Russian missile strike early on May 16, 2023.

He has escaped to Odisha, according to information collected by the police. He will not be spared. The police arrested him on October 19 last year and the factory was sealed. The police submitted chargesheet in the case but this man was granted bail by a local court,” said Banerjee.  {{^userSubscribed}} {{/userSubscribed}}  {{^userSubscribed}} {{/userSubscribed}}  All the deceased and the injured people were factory workers, said Banerjee.  “We will take action against the inspector-in-charge of Egra police station.

Eyewitnesses said, local residents who gathered at the spot roughed up the inspector-in-charge of Egra police station, Mousam Chakraborty, when he reached the spot alleging that the authorities took no action although six explosions took place in the same factory over the last four years.  “Police are the custodian (of law). Strong action must be taken against those assaulting law enforcers. I believe people have the right to demonstrate, but they must not assault policemen,” Banerjee said.  {{^userSubscribed}} {{/userSubscribed}}  {{^userSubscribed}} {{/userSubscribed}}  The president of West Bengal wing of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Sukanta Majumdar said he will seek a probe by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) into the explosion. “The NIA is already probing similar explosions that have taken place in recent years...,” he added.  “I urge @HMOIndia & Hon’ble @BengalGovernor to initiate @NIA_India investigation as early as possible. Bengal has become the stockpile of explosives...,” leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari also tweeted.  Speaking on the BJP demand for an NIA probe, Banerjee said she has no objection to the central agency taking over the investigation.“We do not have any objection to the NIA probe if they arrest the real culprit.

The national police force is setting up a specialist team to gather information about the attacks. “We will analyse all incidents: what kind of area are they taking place in, what explosives or weapons are used? Not just at national level, but also in a European context.”  Police are also stepping up their presence in areas where the violence has been concentrated, such as Crooswijkseweg and Van Speykstraat.  Ingrid Coenradie, councillor for local party Leefbaar Rotterdam, said the community also had a role to play in making their neighbourhood safer. Police have arrested a number of suspects in recent weeks, including two teenage boys who were caught in the act of placing a firebomb.  “Parents, neighbours and relatives need to talk more to the council and the police, because there are plenty of people who know that youths are hanging out on the streets at night,” she said. “Look at each other and ask: ‘why weren’t you home last night?'”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR1dGNobmV3cy5ubC8yMDIzLzA1L2dhbmdzLWJsYW1lZC1mb3Itd2F2ZS1vZi1leHBsb3Npb25zLXRhcmdldGluZy1ob21lcy1pbi1yb3R0ZXJkYW0v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"explosion","2011-08-11","11:00:00","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 15:00:00","asbe  Approximately 12 years ago, I wrote my first public market prognostication and it was focused on gold. At the time, gold was enjoying a parabolic rally, and the discussion amongst the general public was how far past the $2,000 mark gold was going to strike during that rally.  So, on Aug. 11, 2011, I concluded my first gold article on Seeking Alpha as follows:  ""Again, since we are most probably in the final stages of this parabolic fifth wave ""blow-off-top,"" I would seriously consider anything approaching the $1,915 level to be a potential target for a top at this time.""  Needless to say, my first market prognostication was not met with tremendous support. These are a sample of the comments I received from Seeking Alpha readers when I was calling for a metals market top:  ""With all due respect Avi, you plainly do NOT understand the gold market."" ""Your TA is useless. You don't understand the fundamentals because you only look to the past. Gold bulls are forward thinking. The times they are a changing..."" ""The problem is that TA is like driving a car by only looking in the rear view mirror... There is no foresight involved; it's all based on past performance. The future of the fundamentals is what you fail to grasp."" ""There is no way you can understand what is going on in gold by doing technical analysis. Gold is driven by fundamentals."" ""Technical analyses is all well and good, but you cannot apply it to the PM sector which has been artificially manipulated and suppressed for years.""  Yet, as we now know, gold struck a top within $6 of the top for which I was calling.  What many may have seen as either ignorance or hubris, I even provided my downside target even before gold topped, wherein I explained my expectation for gold to drop back down to the $1,000 region.  ""Based upon the Elliott Wave Principle, I would expect a very large pullback. In fact, the target for such a pullback will probably be a minimum low of $1,400, it could fall as low as $1,000, or even as low as $700. It will depend upon how the decline takes form. But those are very viable targets for gold on the downside.""  And, the comments regarding my views were basically the same as above, so, I will just note one of the more ""reasonable"" comments:  ""There is no way to rationalize $700 gold with 50% debasement of currency expected over the next 5 years as US debt grows to $21 trillion from $14. It makes no sense to my feeble mind. I vote for $3000 vs. $1900 today. That makes sense to my mind.""  As you can see, it was quite clear at the time that the ""fundamentals"" were keeping most metals bulls looking to the long side. And, amazingly, those same fundamentals kept the metals bulls looking to the long side of the market during the entire decline.  ElliottWaveTrader.net  But what was truly amazing was that as gold was approaching its long-term low struck at the end of 2015, almost the entire market turned bearish and was again ""certain"" that it would continue in its downside trajectory (just as strongly as they were certain we would eclipse $2,000 in 2011), with most now turning from bullish to predicting a drop below $1,000.  Well, just like everyone was uber-bullish at the highs when we expected a major top, we turned bullish when everyone turned uber-bearish. On Dec. 30, 2015, I urged investors to be moving back into the metals complex as we were looking for a long-term bottom to be struck imminently due to the significant bearishness evident in the market:  ""As we move into 2016, I believe there is a greater than 80% probability that we finally see a long-term bottom formed in the metals and miners and the long term bull market resumes. Those who followed our advice in 2011, and moved out of this market for the correction we expected, are now moving back into this market as we approach the long term bottom. In 2011, before gold even topped, we set our ideal target for this correction in the $700-$1,000 region in gold. We are now reaching our ideal target region, and the pattern we have developed over the last four years is just about complete... For those interested in my advice, I would highly suggest you start moving back into this market with your long term money...""  In fact, back in September 2015, and when the metals mining companies were absolutely hated by the investor community, I rolled out a service on ElliottWaveTrader specifically to focus on the mining industry. We began urging our clients to buy mining stocks during the last quarter of 2015. In fact, I bought stocks such as Newmont Mining (NEM) in the $15-17 region at the time. And, NEM was my largest holding in the complex since that time.  Now, fast-forward to 2022, and gold had been stuck in a correction since a local top was struck back in August 2020. Yet, there were pockets within the market which still rallied into 2022.  An example of such outperformance in 2022 included NEM, which went on to strike higher highs in April 2022. Yet, when NEM struck the 84-85 region, I outlined to the members of The Market Pinball Wizard that, for the first time since I bought NEM in 2015, I was selling almost my entire holdings in the company. You see, I set a target of 82-89 when NEM was hovering in the 28 region. And, when we moved into my target region, I stuck with my plan and sold my largest holding in the complex. Since that time, NEM dropped 57% off its highs.  So, back in January, I provided my latest assessment of the gold market, with an expectation for gold to rally to the $2,428 region in this current move off the early November low. I also noted that we can certainly even blow through that, depending upon the extensions we see in the upcoming rally, but that target was a solid one for now. Clearly, I will reassess the target once the next bullish phase begins in earnest.  And, then in April, I outlined my expectation for the metals market to begin its next rally to the $2,200-plus region. My expectation was that a break-out through $2,075 would trigger that next bigger move. Yet, while the market spiked to $2,085 in early May, I warned members of The Market Pinball Wizard that the structure of that move did not look like it was starting that rally to $2,200 just yet, and I expected more of a pullback. So, while the market did spike through $2,075, it clearly was not able to sustain that rally, as we expected, and it immediately spiked back down below.  At this time, I'm still expecting a fast and strong rally to $2,200-plus in the coming months. And a break-out over $2,085 will likely now be the trigger.  But silver is providing to us a relatively low risk buying opportunity as it's setting up to see a very strong upside follow through when this pullback completes.  To keep it very simple, we have been outlining to the members our expectation for the pullback we're now seeing in silver, and it's now striking our general target region for this expected pullback. As long as silver holds over $22.50, I'm expecting this pullback to complete over the coming week or two and set us up for a strong rally which should be pointing us north of 27 rather quickly.

"explosion","2023-09-12","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 03:03:00","Population Explosion. Pix:Twitter  International concerns about Nigeria’s high fertility rate calls for a deeper reflection on our national demography and its implications. Clearly, Nigeria’s bourgeoning young population is a potential national asset and the envy of the developed nations.  But without a clear-cut plan for their general well-being, especially quality education and job opportunities, the future is bleak and a reason to rue high fertility.  Globally, population is one of those indices through which nations are measured for their strength or the lack of it. Population strength is as potent as the economic power of a country, its political influence and military might in the comity of nations. And closely tied to population is the average fertility rate that obtains from one country to the other.  Given the significance, a recent global ranking placed Nigeria as the 8th most fertile country in the world, and in an odd category crowded by fellow African countries. Notably, Nigeria and the likes have continued to increase global population at a time the world is slowing down and has recorded a 50 per cent drop in fertility. According to the report published by Daily Mail UK, the global average number of children born to each woman is now 2.3, compared to 4.7 in 1970.  While swathes of Europe and North America are recording less than two births per woman on the average, Africa is leading with Somalia (6.4), Chad (6.4), The Democratic Republic of the Congo (6.2), Mali (6.0), the Central African Republic (6.0), Angola (5.4), Nigeria (5.3), Burundi (5.2) and Benin (5.1). The case of Nigeria already stands out for analysts, given the estimated population (without an actual headcount though) in excess of 206 million people – and the seventh most populous country in the world.  Indeed, the debate on values of a large population is not new. In fact, there are two broad schools of thought regarding population and development. Population might be a demographic dividend or a demographic disaster. That is, it could be a great economic, political and social asset, if well harnessed. Otherwise, it is a liability and time bomb of incalculable destruction waiting to happen.  The Malthusian argument of finite resources already forewarned the negative impact of overpopulation, which includes high-level unemployment, hunger, food crisis, and crime rates – and other social ills that are now self-evident in Nigeria and part of the African continent. Again, an unwieldy and poorly managed population increases the number of out-of-school children, which the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) already pegs at 18.5 million in Nigeria alone.  In addition, is fiery competition for scarce resources and seething social tension, coupled with poor access to healthcare, education and general sense of despondency. Not far-fetched in that setting is overcrowding, depletion of natural resources, and environmental degradation.  Population, vis-à-vis available resources, already places Nigeria in a dire strait. Hence, the need to be wary of unbridled population spikes. Because the socio-political and economic structures prevalent in a society are usually the deciding factor of population policy, concerned stakeholders have consistently said that the very low level of Nigeria’s utilisation of available resources has set the country up for minimal population growth rate – if it must avert disaster.  So, population growth must slow down until Nigeria gets the socioeconomic parameters right. Therefore, at present, the political office holders need to stabilise the political economy, come up and enforce a policy that will keep the population within manageable limits; not discounting civic education to show down the birth rate.  On the flip side of the narrative, however, the population positivists argue that a large demography is not the problem per se, but for the poor management of its potential. They argued that declining fertility rates could lead to a stagnant population, which is crippling many advanced economies and overwhelming public support systems.  Currently, falling fertility rates mean nearly every country could have shrinking populations by the end of the century. No fewer than 23 nations – including Spain and Japan – are expected to see their populations halve by 2100. Researchers at the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation also showed the global fertility rate nearly halved to 2.4 in 2017 – and their study projects it will fall below 1.7 by the turn of this century. The implication is that countries will also age dramatically, with as many people turning 80 as there are being born.  On the contrary, Nigeria’s rapidly growing population is giving life to the baby food market and industries. According to a research firm, the Nigerian baby food market has a promising future and is expected to reach over N200 billion by 2023 on the back of high birth rate and fertility rate. While the multinational companies (MNCs) are already enjoying steady patronage from the Nigerian baby food market, the market remains an untapped opportunity for Nigerians.

Source: Getty Images  Article continues below advertisement  What happened at the Upper Big Branch Mine disaster?  The Upper Big Branch Mine disaster is known as the second deadliest coal mine disaster in the U.S. It happened on April 5, 2010, at the Upper Branch Montcoal Eagle Mine, about 30 miles south of the West Virginia state capital of Charleston.  At 3:27 p.m. that afternoon, miners were working 1,000 feet underground when a massive explosion rocked the mine. It was later determined that the blast was caused by a build-up of methane gas and coal dust, the U.S. Department of Labor’s Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) reported.  Article continues below advertisement  Initially, 25 miners were killed, and four were missing after the blast. The four missing were found dead in the mine four days later. 28 of the dead were employees of Massey Energy, the company that owned the mine, and one miner was a contractor, The New York Times reported in 2010.  Source: Getty Images  Article continues below advertisement  Did anyone survive the Upper Big Branch Mine explosion?  Nine miners survived the UBB mine disaster. Survivor Stanely Stewart, who was 300 to 400 feet underground when the explosion happened, told ABC News that he struggled through “hurricane-force” winds and flying debris to get out of the mine.  Survivor James Woods was one of nine miners traveling in an underground vehicle on their way out of the mine at the time of the explosion. The blast killed seven of those in the vehicle, and Woods was pulled out of the mine barely alive, the Associated Press reported. Woods’s son, Jeremy, also worked in the mine and survived the blast.

Who was at fault for the Upper Big Branch Mine disaster?  Massey Energy, the company that owned the Upper Big Branch Mine, was found primarily at fault for the explosion. A year after the tragedy, an independent investigation panel appointed by Governor Earl Ray Tomblin, who was governor of West Virginia at the time, found that the blast was “man-made and could have been prevented had Massey Energy followed basic, well-tested, and historically proven safety procedures.”  Article continues below advertisement  Source: Getty Images Performance Coal Company, a subsidiary of Massey Energy, operated the UBB mine.

I am no longer ashamed,” Josie Concepcion said years after the traumatic event of her life.  Josie and her granddaughter in front of her sari-sari store in Lutayan, Sultan Kudarat. Photo: B. Sultan/ICRC  Josie, alongside her son, was one of the victims of a massive explosion near a market in Sultan Kudarat 15 years ago, according to a report released by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).  Luckily, her son was safe with a minor injury. But for her, life went straight downhill.  She went through multiple surgeries to recover her left leg which was badly fractured because of the explosion.  Healthcare professionals noticed that her legs were not of the same length anymore, which explained why she had a hard time walking.  She was given crutches by a volunteer of the Philippine Red Cross she met during that time.  Josie did not just struggle physically but also emotionally and mentally, the ICRC noted. As years passed, she felt like a burden and a useless mother to her family. When she attends Mass or walks outside, people would look at her with derision.  People would mock her saying, “Here comes the cripple.” Josie said it pains her to hear those words.  “I wanted to escape. I wanted to end my suffering. But in a fleeting moment, I thought of my family. ‘What will happen to my children? My husband?’” she was quoted in the ICRC report.  With all those struggles she faced, her husband was her biggest supporter. She felt love and kept going with her life despite all the mockery and gossip she hears.  In 2018, a social worker mentioned that the Davao Jubilee Foundation (DJF) has a program that helps people who were victims of armed conflict.  Josie in front of her newly constructed store. Photo: I. Ali/ICRC  The DJF program strives to make a positive impact on the lives of people affected by armed conflicts. Through this initiative, individuals in need receive specially crafted devices designed to enhance their mobility and independence. The ICRC supports the DJF’s physical rehabilitation services as well as donations for food and transportation for the beneficiaries.  Josie was told that she would no longer have to use crutches if she uses an orthoprosthesis. She was uncertain about that suggestion but she gave it a try and visited the DJF’s office.  After being fitted and learning how to walk with the orthoprosthesis, Josie’s life slowly came back to what it used to be.  The orthoprosthesis, according to the ICRC, serves as an attachment to Josie’s shorter leg, giving her equal footing with the good leg. This secures her balance with both feet planted on the ground, eliminating the need for crutches and ultimately enabling Josie to do the things she loves with ease.  Years after bearing with all the discrimination and mockery of other people, her wish to walk the way she walked before came true. With the help of DJF and ICRC, she is ready to face the world more confidently without thinking about what people might say about her. She is thankful for the support given to her.  Josie now owns a small sari-sari store which she started through ICRC’s micro economic initiatives project—providing productive grants to affected Mindanawons to start or revive their own business.  Now, her only wish is to walk up the stage and proudly hang a medal on her son without the crutches she’s been using for the past years.  “I have nothing to leave to them but their education. I encouraged my son, who is a consistent honor student, to keep up his good work. It is my dream to go up on stage for his graduation. Before, every time he received an award, I refused to go on stage because of my crutches. Now, I want to go on stage without it,” she said.

Suddenly the van exploded, causing PC Hilbery to be thrown back by the blast. She sustained severe burns and had glass embedded in her face and upper torso.  PC Farrow moved PC Hilbery away from further danger and provided initial first aid.  Colleagues started looking for the suspect, with all available units at Southend Police Station making their way to the scene.  He was located within the vehicle and officers got him out to a place of safety, before placing him under arrest.  PC Farrow made surrounding occupants aware of the situation, activating his vehicle siren and lights to draw people's attention, before directing them to a safe place.  Three other officers, including Sgt Katy Major, arrived within minutes and helped him evacuate the whole street.  Sgt Major took control of the scene and ensured roadblocks were put in once the area was cleared.  PC Hilbery was being tended to by PC Steve Martin and PC Garry Neal.  They stripped off her burned clothing and poured water over her to reduce the burns.  Story continues  Sgt Major directed the rest of her team to bang on doors to get more water, for both PC Hilbery and for the suspect, who was also injured and receiving first aid.  Paramedics arrived, took over first aid and conveyed PC Hilbery to the hospital. The paramedics praised the officers on scene, whose quick actions ""undoubtedly"" lessened the severity of PC Hilbery’s burns.  PC Martin said: “We heard officers going to an incident which didn’t seem overly serious… And then the next thing we heard was an emergency call… over the radio, all you could make out was there’d been an explosion and someone was hurt.  “On that particular scene, because I knew that a police officer had been hurt, there’s a lot of confusion, people are quite upset with what’s going on, and then when you’re seeing a colleague being brought towards you, clearly in pain, it’s a bit of a cliché but the training did take over in terms of the medical treatment we gave her.  “It’s good to see that the training we had meant that we could minimise any injuries to Sam and that she remains a police officer doing the job for the people of Essex.”  The suspect went to court but was found not guilty of any offences.  Essex Police Federation Chair Laura Heggie said: “All of the officers who attended this incident showed great professionalism and initiative, in what was a very traumatic and stressful situation. Together they were able to detain the suspect, secure the scene, protect the public, and ensure that PC Hilbery was given the best care possible.  “Seeing a colleague in pain is a distressing experience for everyone, but these officers were able to remain calm and composed. They should all be very proud of their brave and exemplary actions.”  The officers will attend the Essex Police Federation Bravery Awards on Thursday (May 18).  At the event a winner will be announced who will travel to London for the National Police Federation Bravery Awards in July.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vdWsuc3BvcnRzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL2JyYXZlLXBvbGljZS1hY3RlZC1mYXN0LXNvdXRoZW5kLTEzMDc0NzAzMy5odG1s0gFYaHR0cHM6Ly91ay5zcG9ydHMueWFob28uY29tL2FtcGh0bWwvbmV3cy9icmF2ZS1wb2xpY2UtYWN0ZWQtZmFzdC1zb3V0aGVuZC0xMzA3NDcwMzMuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"explosion","2023-06-26","10:00:00","{""Warren"", ""Michigan"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 17:59:20","The latest GM airbag recall impacts approximately 994,763 vehicles that may be equipped with defective ARC Automotive airbag inflators, including;  2014 through 2017 Buick Enclave vehicles manufactured from March 26, 2013 through May 12, 2017  2014 through 2017 Chevrolet Traverse vehicles manufactured from March 26, 2014 through May 12, 2017  2017 GMC Acadia vehicles manufactured from March 26, 2014 through March 29, 2017.  Owners will receive notification of the recall beginning June 26, 2023, according to the recall notice. Licensed GM dealers will provide complimentary replacement of the front driver’s side airbag module with a new inflator.  For more information, owners can contact Buick customer service at 1-800-521-7300, Chevrolet customer service at 1-800-222-1020, or GMC customer service at 1-800-462-8782 and reference GM’s recall number N232404980.  ARC Automotive Inflator Recall Requested by NHTSA  Officials have called for ARC Automotive to issue a recall for approximately 67 million air bag inflators, following reports of the air bags exploding, sending sharp metal fragments and debris at the vehicle’s occupants. They provided detailed reports of the airbags rupturing and causing injuries to consumers in the airbag recall request to ARC.  NHTSA officials have been independently investigating the safety of airbags manufactured by ARC Automotive since August of 2016, after receiving multiple reports of consumers sustaining severe injuries to their head, face, and legs, as well as at least one fatality that resulted from a ruptured airbag.  After initiating an investigating into the exploding airbags, the agency concluded that a defect in the manufacturing process of the airbag inflators contributed to a blockage of the inflator. The blockage, which occurred as a byproduct of welding during manufacturing of the inflator, can cause over pressurization, which can then overinflate and rupture the airbag, resulting in an explosion of metal debris into the vehicle’s passenger compartment.  ARC Automotive maintains that a defect is not present in their airbag inflators. Despite the potentially significant and unreasonable safety risks the inflators pose to consumers, ARC has not cooperated with the agency in issuing a safety recall, which has prompted several automobile manufacturers to issue recalls of their own, impacting thousands of vehicles.  To date, General Motors has now issued five separate recalls since 2018, affecting model year 2010 through 2011 Chevrolet Malibu vehicles, model year 2008 through 2017 Buick Enclave, GMC Acadia, and Chevrolet Traverse vehicles equipped with airbag inflators manufactured by ARC.  In addition, BMW issued a recall in 2017 of their model year 2017 X5 sDrive35i, X5 xDrive35i, X5 xDrive50i, X5 xDrive35d, and X5 xDrive40e vehicles, Ford issued a recall in 2017 of their model year Mustang and F-150 pickup vehicles, while Volkswagen also issued a recall in 2022 of various model year 2016 Volkswagen and Audi vehicles.  The NHTSA says it may take other appropriate action against ARC if they continue to decline initiating a voluntary recall. The agency has indicated that if an ARC recall is not issued, the airbag inflator manufacturer must provide a detailed explanation on why they believe the product is safe, along with data supporting their analysis.  Takata Airbag Recall Still Affecting the U.S. Auto Industry  These latest airbag problems comes while the U.S. auto industry continues to replace defective Takata airbags, which were also found to explode and project metal debris onto vehicle occupants due to a defect in the airbags design. At least 28 deaths and more than 400 injuries have resulted from the defective Takata airbag inflators.  More than 100 million Takata airbags have been recalled worldwide since 2014, impacting tens of millions of vehicles from more than 20 automobile manufacturers. Officials identified that the chemical nitrate was used to inflate the air bags, which can break down from exposure to heat or humidity, resulting in the explosion of metal fragments and debris.  The series of Takata airbag recalls has been considered the largest and one of the most complex series of recalls ever recorded in U.S. history. However, if approximately 67 million ARC Automotive airbags are recalled in the coming weeks, the auto industry could be plagued for years bv the need to repair and replace the recalled airbags, in addition to the risk of potential product liability lawsuits.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFib3V0bGF3c3VpdHMuY29tL2dtLWFyYy1haXJiYWctaW5mbGF0b3ItZXhwbG9zaW9uLXJlY2FsbC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

By Tuesday afternoon firefighters had turned the building at 716 Oregon Ave. back over to the Spokane-based OXARC company, said Ben Shearer, the Pasco Fire Department public information officer.  Firefighters were called shortly before 10:20 a.m. for an explosion in a metal building where acetylene is manufactured. The production building contained only acetylene containers and the machine that makes it.  Acetylene is a flammable gas used in welding and doesn’t produce much smoke when it burns. It’s kept in canisters under pressure, and it can explode when exposed to high heat.  It’s not clear what sparked the fire.  One employee was working in the area when the explosion happened but was able to escape unharmed.  OXARC employees were evaluated by Pasco medics at the scene and one employee was taken to a local medical center to be checked further, said Shearer.  Much of the time battling the blaze was spent planning an approach to extinguish several burning containers of acetylene but not put fire crews at risk.  “The fire was complicated from the aspect that OXARC is a large supplier of many different gas products, some that do not care if they get wet and some react violently if they get wet,” Shearer said in a news release.  They worked with OXARC employees to determine where the acetylene was being stored and making sure the machinery that produced it was shut off.  Firefighters on the scene focused on making sure the heat and fire didn’t spread to other buildings.  “Once we knew what we were dealing with, everything went very quickly and efficiently,” Shearer said.  Shearer didn’t know how extensive the damage was to the building, but the business is shut down at the moment.  OXARC provides welding and industrial supplies and safety products and training from its 21 locations across the Northwest.  While there was some initial concerns about the smoke and acetylene in the air moving through East Pasco, Shearer said the gas had dissipated quickly. He said they are not aware of any public health issues.  Story continues  There also wasn’t any chemical spills. Shearer said firefighters prevented water from going into the storm drains.  An explosion forced people to flee from OXARC Tuesday morning. Firefighters have closed Oregon Avenue to battle the blaze.  Oregon Avenue has opened after being shut between East A Street and East Lewis Street. It also sparked a brief lockdown at some nearby schools as a precaution.  The warm temperatures meant firefighters were being rotated in and out at the scene and then able to rest in a cooling area.  In all, 34 fire units helped at the fire, including crews from Pasco, Richland, Kennewick, Franklin County Fire District 3, Walla Walla Fire District 5, Benton County Fire districts 1 and 4, West Benton Fire Rescue and from the police and utility crews from Pasco and Franklin Emergency Management.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vY2Euc3BvcnRzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL2V4cGxvc2lvbi1maXJlLWZvcmNlLWV2YWN1YXRpb25zLXBhc2NvLTE4MDg1MDYyNC5odG1s0gFeaHR0cHM6Ly9jYS5zcG9ydHMueWFob28uY29tL2FtcGh0bWwvbmV3cy9leHBsb3Npb24tZmlyZS1mb3JjZS1ldmFjdWF0aW9ucy1wYXNjby0xODA4NTA2MjQuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

City officials say an initial investigation shows an underground electric cable likely caught fire and caused the chain of explosions.  National Grid workers also told 2 On Your Side they were replacing a cable carrying 25,000 volts.  2 On Your Side is told the cables are around 100 years old and the city has been replacing some of them around town prior to the manhole explosions along Edward Street.  Despite this, National Grid officials say it's under investigation and they're still determining a cause.  As of Tuesday night, four of five commercial buildings that lost power now have it back.  That's except for the Cyclorama Building on Franklin and Edward.  David Bertola -- a spokesperson for National Grid -- says there was a small fire in the building and they are investigating whether the explosions caused it.  Power will be restored there once an inspection is completed.  There were no injuries from the explosions.  However, this is not the first time there's been a manhole explosion in the city.  2 On Your Side asked Bertola if the company plans to take any steps to prevent future explosions.  ""We're always assessing and looking at the frequency of these kinds of things and so I'm sure that will be looked at. We're in the middle of an investigation into what caused the incident. So that may be part of the conversation as well,"" Bertola said.

An explosive device was found on the 3500 block of North 17th Street in the city's Tioga section around 3:40 a.m Tuesday.  Police say the device was used in an attempt to blow up an ATM located just outside a convenience store.  Footage from inside the store shows three men dressed in hooded sweatshirts crowded around the counter. One of the men dressed in red pants is seen placing something near the ATM that begins to smoke as the trio flees the store.

(Image credit: UiT/AKMA3)  Ocean explorers in the Arctic have discovered an underwater volcano spewing mud and methane from inside another, larger crater that probably formed after a catastrophic blowout at the end of the last ice age.  Researchers spotted the unusual feature about 80 miles (130 kilometers) south of Norway's Bear Island, or Bjørnøya, in the Barents Sea. The volcano, which the team named the Borealis Mud Volcano, is only the second of its kind discovered in Norwegian waters.  ""Exploring the seabed and discovering new methane [seeps] is like finding hidden treasures,"" said Stefan Buenz (opens in new tab), a professor at The Arctic University of Norway (University of Tromsø) and co-leader of the Advancing Knowledge of Methane in the Arctic (AKMA) expedition that made the discovery. ""Every time we go down to the seabed, we get the feeling that we have just begun to understand the great and incredible diversity of such [seep] systems,"" Buenz said in a translated statement (opens in new tab).  A submarine mud volcano is a geological structure formed by an expulsion of muddy fluid and gas, predominantly methane.  The Borealis Mud Volcano measures roughly 23 feet (7 meters) in diameter and is about 8 feet (2.5 m) tall. On May 7, the scientists used a remote-controlled rover to capture footage of the small mount continuously emitting a muddy fluid, which the researchers say is rich in methane. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas once it reaches the atmosphere and contributes to climate change .  Related: 'Mind boggling' array of 19,000 undersea volcanoes discovered with high-resolution radar satellites  The volcano sits in the middle of another, much larger crater, which is 984 feet (300 m) wide and 82 feet (25 m) deep. The exceptional formation sits 1,312 feet (400 m) below the sea surface and likely resulted from a sudden and massive methane eruption after the last glacial period, 18,000 years ago, according to the statement.  ""Seeing an underwater eruption in real time reminds me how 'alive' our planet is,"" Giuliana Panieri (opens in new tab), a professor in geology at The Arctic University of Norway and the leader of the expedition, said in the statement.  The researchers found the volcano's flanks teeming with animal life feeding off carbonate crusts — mineral crusts formed when microorganisms consume methane and produce bicarbonate as a byproduct, according to a 2019 study in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health (opens in new tab) — that formed thousands of years ago. They spied sea anemones, sponges, corals, starfish, sea spiders and diverse crustaceans.  The only other known mud volcano in Norwegian waters is the Håkon Mosby volcano. This 0.6-mile-wide (1 km) feature was discovered 4,100 feet (1,250 m) below the water’s surface on the seabed south of Svalbard in 1995, according to the University of Bergen's Center for Geobiology (opens in new tab). Underwater mud volcanoes are difficult to spot and map, but researchers estimate there could be hundreds or thousands of them on the seafloor globally, according to a 2021 chapter in Lecture Notes in Earth System Sciences (opens in new tab).  These volcanoes provide a rare window into geological processes occurring deep below Earth's crust, since they spout mainly water, minerals and fine sediment from these depths. They also offer clues about previous environments and conditions on Earth, and could give an insight into systems on other planets, Panieri said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlc2NpZW5jZS5jb20vcGxhbmV0LWVhcnRoL3ZvbGNhbm9zL3NjaWVudGlzdHMtZGlzY292ZXItZ2lhbnQtY3JhdGVyLWZyb20taWNlLWFnZS1leHBsb3Npb24tdGhhdC1oYXMtbWV0aGFuZS1zcGV3aW5nLW11ZC12b2xjYW5vLWluc2lkZS1pdNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The past five days for Marissa have been draining.  Stephen, the rock of the Webber family, is in extreme pain.  “He can’t use both of his hands at all. He has broken bones on almost all of his fingers. His wrist is shattered the other hand is broken,” Marissa said.  He also has a broken arm, ribs, even burns and cuts on his face.  Thursday morning at Stephen’s repair shop, Sandman Automotive, he and another man were working on a home heating oil tank, using a plasma cutter.  Then there was a noise which was heard up to two miles away.  “You wouldn’t believe the sound that came it was just a huge explosion,” said Brian Daigle, who works nearby.  The two men were rushed to the hospital.  It’s unclear how the second man is doing tonight.  “It was very scary he doesn’t look like my dad because he’s all bandaged up here and his face is very swollen,” said Marissa.

"explosion","2021-08-17","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 18:44:28","Astronomers have discovered the biggest cosmic explosion ever witnessed, a massive burst of energy 2 trillion times brighter than our sun and 10 times more powerful than the most powerful supernova.  The explosion, which occurred 8 billion light years away from Earth billions of years ago, has been erupting for three years without any signs of slowing down. Although scientists at first struggled to determine the cause of the cosmic blast, which they have named AT2021lwx, they now think the culprit is a supermassive black hole that came in contact with a gargantuan cloud of gas. That’s according to findings recently published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.  Stretching across a space that is 100 times the size of our solar system, the black hole formation is currently giving off 100 times more energy than the sun will emit over the course of its entire 10-billion-year lifetime.  The explosion itself is far from Earth, but its discovery could help scientists better understand black holes, which sit at the center of many galaxies, including our own.  “It really seems like, especially when they have time to do some more modeling, this will be an important step in understanding what’s happening in the middle of galaxies,” says Jonathan Blazek, a physics professor at Northeastern University.  Astronomers at the Zwicky Transient Facility in California originally discovered AT2021lwx in 2020 but struggled to suss out the exact cause of such a massive explosion. AT2021lwx was emitting too much light for too long to fit any known category of astronomical phenomenon, whether it was a supernova, aka an exploding star, or a tidal disruption, which occurs when a star has been pulled into a black hole and destroyed.  Eventually, NASA’s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, Chile’s New Technology Telescope and Spain’s Gran Telescopio Canarias were all brought online to aid in studying AT2021lwx. With all these telescopes pointed at AT2021lwx, astronomers eventually identified the black hole-related explanation they have settled on in their findings.  Blazek says the astrophysical qualities of a black hole definitely are primed to cause an explosion at this scale. Once a black hole gets large enough, it creates such a gravitational whirlpool that it starts sucking in anything that’s close to it, growing in the process. Anything that crosses the event horizon, the point of no return, and falls into the black hole is gone––it will never be seen or heard from again. That includes light.  So, how does a black hole cause an explosion with enough light to be seen billions of light years away by scientists on Earth?  “Because these are such big, extreme objects, you can have some pretty big, extreme things happening just outside the event horizon,” Blazek says.  The pull of a black hole is so strong that anything caught in its wake gets accelerated to the point where it’s moving near the speed of light, creating swirling, rapidly moving particles that are bumping into each other.  “You get really, really, really hot material outside the event horizon of the blackhole, and this really hot material can emit a lot of energy,” Blazek says. “It turns out the most efficient way to get energy out of mass is to drop it into a black hole.”  According to Blazek, there is a whole class of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) that are powered this way. Mass falls into a black hole, it gets shredded at high velocities and emits a ton of energy. But typically those kinds of events create a steadily increasing amount of energy and light that scientists can observe. That wasn’t the case here.  “They can find no evidence that this was active before, so their best theory is that this was a blackhole about a billion solar masses [large] that was just sitting there quietly because nothing was around to fall in,” he says. “Then, they think a big mass of gas got too close and pretty quickly got shredded and fell in.”  Blazek says this explosion has similarities to other cosmic phenomena, like AGNs, but it’s the differences that make the discovery so exciting.  Blazek says understanding more about the nature of black holes could help with his own work, which involves using galaxies and the movement of mass through the universe to map the cosmos. Black holes are instrumental in moving all kinds of matter through outer space. Although astronomers have learned a lot about black holes, there is still much that isn’t known about how supermassive black holes are created. By further studying an event like this cosmic explosion, scientists could unlock even more about these powerful cosmic forces and the nature of our galaxy as well.  “We don’t fully understand how these things grow, especially early on in their lives,” Blazek says. “If we see an event where a cloud of more than 1,000 solar masses is falling onto a black hole, in the sort of event we didn’t know could happen, that could be an important piece of this puzzle.”  Cody Mello-Klein is a Northeastern Global News reporter.

"explosion","2021-09-24","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 20:00:06","Astronomers have witnessed the largest explosion in space.  The explosive event labeled AT2021lwx was observed to be ten times brighter than any known supernova, the explosions that occur as massive stars die. And whereas supernova explosions only last a few months, this explosive event has been raging for at least three years.  AT2021lwx is also three times brighter than the light that is emitted as stars are ripped apart and devoured by supermassive black holes, occurrences called ""tidal disruption events"" or ""TDEs."" The blast is around 8 billion light-years from Earth and thus occurred when the universe was just 6 billion years old.  AT2021lwx was first spotted by the Zwicky Transient Facility in California in 2020 and was then picked up by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) based in Hawaii. Both of these systems are designed to survey the night sky for astronomical events that rapidly change in brightness over time, also known as ""transients."" This change in brightness can indicate a supernova or a gamma-ray burst (GRB) deep in the universe or something much closer to home like a comet or an asteroid.  Though it was spotted by these facilities three years ago, the sheer scale and power of the explosion AT2021lwx were unknown until now.  ""We came upon this by chance, as it was flagged by our search algorithm when we were searching for a type of supernova,"" University of Southampton research fellow Philip Wiseman, who led the research, said in an emailed statement. ""Most supernovae and TDEs only last for a couple of months before fading away. For something to be bright for two plus years was immediately very unusual.""  Wiseman and the team of astronomers think that AT2021lwx may be the result of a black hole violently disrupting a cloud of gas with a mass thousands of times greater than the sun. As it did so, the black hole swallowed fragments of the gas cloud, sending shockwaves into both what remains of the gas and into a wider donut-shaped torus of dust surrounding it, causing them to emit bright electromagnetic radiation.  Events like this have been witnessed before, they are rare. What's more, none that have been witnessed previously have been on the scale of AT2021lwx.  While AT2021lwx isn't actually as bright as the gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A spotted by astronomers in 2022, this event that erupted from 2.4 billion light-years away lasted for just ten hours after detection. Even though that is quite long for a GRB, it means that AT2021lwx has put out far more energy over its entire lifetime than this gamma-ray burst did in its own.  Measuring the power of a cosmic explosion  Following its initial discovery, the team of researchers behind this discovery continued to examine AT2021lwx using several different telescopes including the Neil Gehrels Swift Telescope, the New Technology Telescope in Chile, and the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, Spain.  Following these observations, the researchers took the spectrum of light that was emitted from the event and split it down into its constituent wavelengths, measuring how light was emitted and absorbed around the event. This allowed the researchers to calculate the distance to the source of AT2021lwx.  ""Once you know the distance to the object and how bright it appears to us, you can calculate the brightness of the object at its source,"" team member and University of Southampton professor Sebastian Hönig said in the statement. ""Once we'd performed those calculations, we realized this is extremely bright.""  The only thing in the known universe that is as bright as AT2021lwx are supermassive black holes. When these black holes feed on stellar gases that fall into them at high velocities, they can let off incredibly bright emissions known as quasars.  ""With a quasar, we see the brightness flickering up and down over time,"" team member and University of Southampton professor Mark Sullivan added. ""But looking back over a decade there was no detection of AT2021lwx, then suddenly it appears with the brightness of the brightest things in the universe, which is unprecedented.""  Though there are other possible explanations for the explosive event, the astronomers currently favor the explanation that sees an extremely large cloud of mostly gaseous hydrogen or dust that was knocked from its orbit around the black hole and sucked into it. This will only be conclusively determined when the team has collected more data about AT2021lwx.  The team will now look at the explosion in different wavelengths of light including X-rays. Doing so could reveal the temperature of the event and what processes are driving it. They will also conduct computer simulations to discover if their model of a titanic gas cloud disrupted by a black hole could account for AT2021lwx.  ""With new facilities, like the Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time, coming online in the next few years, we are hoping to discover more events like this and learn more about them,"" Wiseman concluded in the statement. ""It could be that these events, although extremely rare, are so energetic that they are key processes to how the centers of galaxies change over time.""

Sui (SUI) Poised for Significant Price Increase  Altcoin Sherpa, a well-known crypto analyst, predicts a substantial rally for the native token of the layer-1 blockchain Sui (SUI). With a relatively small overall float compared to the total supply, Sherpa believes that market makers can easily manipulate the token, making it an attractive investment. The analyst suggests that buying SUI around $1 could yield profitable returns, although the timing of the price surge remains uncertain.

This is a unique trait of cheap stocks, and when paired with things like a low float and higher short interest, parabolic moves can happen.  It’s worth understanding that these quick moves higher can happen in the opposite direction just as swiftly. That’s one of the most significant reasons why penny stocks are so risky. Could OMH stock go higher? Can it go lower? The answer to both questions is “yes,” depending on which side of the trade you’re on, it will be the difference between loving or hating penny stocks in many cases.  The same applies to other former penny","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vcGVubnlzdG9ja3MuY29tL2ZlYXR1cmVkLzIwMjMvMDUvMTUvMy10b3AtcGVubnktc3RvY2tzLXRvLXdhdGNoLWdzaXQtb21oLXN0b2NrLWV4cGxvZGUv0gFfaHR0cHM6Ly9wZW5ueXN0b2Nrcy5jb20vZmVhdHVyZWQvMjAyMy8wNS8xNS8zLXRvcC1wZW5ueS1zdG9ja3MtdG8td2F0Y2gtZ3NpdC1vbWgtc3RvY2stZXhwbG9kZS8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

At first the tremors, which were registered on Saturday, were thought to have been caused by earthquakes.  Then, seismologists theorised that they originated from controlled explosions in Poland, almost 90 miles to the south, as part of military exercises.  But they are still not certain of the true origin of the unexplained geological phenomenon.  FILE PHOTO: Gas leak at Nord Stream 2 as seen from the Danish F-16 interceptor on Bornholm, Denmark September 27, 2022  On Monday, the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, an official body that monitors the underground, said the tremors were 'not caused by earthquakes, but by pressure waves from an event in the atmosphere.'  However, they came from 'an unknown source.'  'The seismologists can report that it is unlikely that the tremors originate from a controlled explosion in Poland, which was carried out shortly before the first reports of tremors on Bornholm,' the body known as GEUS said in a statement.  On Saturday, GEUS said it had received 'more than 60' tips from people on Bornholm that 'earthquake-like tremors' - described as a deep rumbling, shaking and rattling, changing pressure in the ear - had been reported in the afternoon on Bornholm.  This map, created shortly after the leaks in the Nord Stream pipeline were detected, shows the location of the Danish island of Bornholm  Police said they too were contacted by members of the public about the tremor on the eastern part of the island.  Danish media reported that the tremors caused a crack in the wall of a house, but no one was hurt.  GEUS said that seismic tremors were measured at a magnitude of 2.3.  Polish authorities have said that there was intensive activity during the Anakonda23 exercise in Ustka, northern Poland, involving jet fighters and live firing of artillery munitions.  GEUS, an independent research and advisory institution within Denmark's Ministry of Climate, Energy and Utilities, said that it had two seismographs on Bornholm that collect data around the clock.  Bornholm, home to nearly 40,000 people, is a rocky island in the Baltic Sea, south of Sweden, northeast of Germany and north of Poland.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlLTEyMDg1NjcxL015c3RlcmlvdXMtdHJlbW9ycy1yb2NrLURhbmlzaC1pc2xhbmQtQm9ybmhvbG0tbmVhci1Ob3JkLVN0cmVhbS1leHBsb3Npb24tc2l0ZS5odG1s0gGJAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUtMTIwODU2NzEvYW1wL015c3RlcmlvdXMtdHJlbW9ycy1yb2NrLURhbmlzaC1pc2xhbmQtQm9ybmhvbG0tbmVhci1Ob3JkLVN0cmVhbS1leHBsb3Npb24tc2l0ZS5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"explosion","2023-05-12","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Mon 15 May 2023 15:15:00","Something pretty huge happened in space recently. Well, that’s not strictly true – to be more accurate, something truly gargantuan happened in space approximately 8 billion years ago, that we are only just finding out about now. Last Friday, scientists revealed the largest cosmic explosion ever witnessed: like a supernova, but more than 10 times brighter and more powerful than any other seen before. And its cause? A giant cloud of gas being sucked into a supermassive black hole.  If you want people to be excited about something, it’s important to come up with a catchy name. So, taking a leaf out of Elon Musk’s book of baby names, scientists called it AT2021lwx. But I’m gonna call her Sue. Sue Pernova. (You’re welcome.)  Sue had humble beginnings. She started out like the damp patch in the corner of your bathroom – small and barely noticeable, then over the course of time growing into something monstrous and without precedent. It was only when scientists established just how distant Sue was (8 billion lightyears) that they realised quite how much energy she must be burning to produce a light so bright.  01:17 ‘Absolutely gargantuan’: astrophysicist explains largest cosmic explosion ever witnessed – video  This is all well and good, I hear you cry, but why should I care? Sue seems great, but she lives miles away and besides I’m far too busy having to do the weekly shop, picking up the kids from school and Googling “black mould removal”. Well, I’ve been a space superfan since I was old enough to say “Houston we have a problem”, so you don’t have to convince me to care. But space can give us an insight into our existence.  There are certain aspects of space exploration that are easy to defend. Like the Dart mission last year which successfully tested technology designed to shift an asteroid off its course, protecting Earth and its inhabitants from a fatal collision. Most of us have a vested interest in the Earth not being smashed to smithereens, so it’s great to know that Nasa is on the case.  Some of the other stuff, though, is far more abstract and, for want of a better word, nerdy. But the truth is, every time something like this happens it puts another piece in the puzzle of understanding where we came from and where we will go.  We all know some basic things about the universe and our solar system from our school days: Jupiter has its raging stormy eye, Saturn has its rings, and Pluto has an identity crisis about its latest reclassification. But what you perhaps didn’t know, because they only found out recently, is that Saturn didn’t always have its rings.  A study from the University of Colorado suggests that the rings are only 400 million years old, with Saturn being nearer 4.5 billion years in age. Those figures are quite hard to get your head around, but if you scale that timeline down, it’s the equivalent of an 85-year-old bloke called Stanley deciding to grow a mo-hawk at 81. That’s a pretty wild and late-stage development, right? Certainly not something to define his whole existence by.  In the even blinkier-blink of an eye that is the period of human existence, we happen to have magically coincided with this beautiful phenomenon. Us being here now at the same time of Saturn’s rings is a delightful coincidence: a reminder that everything is fleeting, everything is changing, even in the universe.  Someone sent me a meme recently with a picture of the galaxy and an arrow pointing to a barely visible dot labelled “You, crying in the shower”. Apart from being very funny, it’s also very true (the crying bit, certainly). I find the underlying message of it weirdly profound. We are all so very small and the universe is so very big and almost all of our hopes, dreams and fears are entirely trivial.  If that doesn’t sound particularly comforting, stick with me. In 2009, Nasa released captures from the Hubble telescope showing the deepest image of the universe ever taken to date, allowing you to scroll in and out of hundreds of galaxies and solar systems that seemingly go on for ever. If you ever need a moment of profound perspective, that does it.  Cosmically speaking, if we are all insignificant, then everything we do is almost in defiance of that. It renders the choices we make simultaneously meaningless and also the most wonderful act of living; one more beautiful addition to an already improbable existence. That’s a pretty liberating thought. It’s all connected. Like it or not, we’re all part of a kind of celestial foxtrot: expanding, contracting, dying and being reborn.  So next time you hear about something happening a million miles away, think about how you’re a small part of that and how incredible it is to exist. Why not look out of your window tonight – maybe you’ll see the light from some supernova long since gone. And who knows, perhaps someone 8 billion lightyears away will be looking back from their damp, damp, bathroom, seeing the dead light from our sun and wondering about their own place in the universe.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9jb21tZW50aXNmcmVlLzIwMjMvbWF5LzE1L2JpZ2dlc3QtZXZlci1zcGFjZS1leHBsb3Npb24tOC1iaWxsaW9uLWxpZ2h0eWVhcnPSAWdodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vY29tbWVudGlzZnJlZS8yMDIzL21heS8xNS9iaWdnZXN0LWV2ZXItc3BhY2UtZXhwbG9zaW9uLTgtYmlsbGlvbi1saWdodHllYXJz?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

'Sport's Greatest Statistical Anomalies' is his book, and aside from being a BRILLIANT read, is testament to his love of all things sport, and in particular stats. A Nets fan, James yearns for the days of yesteryear, when playoffs were all but irrelevant and the likes of Caris Levert and Jarrett Allen were running the show.  Philadelphia 76ers coach Doc Rivers has been on the wrong end of plenty of dominant Game 7 performances, but Jayson Tatum’s explosion on Sunday night ranks right at the top, according to the man himself.  Tatum was simply unstoppable in the series-deciding matchup, putting up a mammoth 51 points on 17-28 shooting while also grabbing 13 boards and dishing out five assists en route to a 112-88 victory. James Harden faltered – again – and so too did Joel Embiid, but Tatum was the clear difference-maker throughout the course of the game.  In the wake of the defeat, Tatum’s performance was ranked by Rivers as one of the absolute best, saying that the only game which compares was LeBron James’ Game 6 effort against his Boston Celtics in 2012.

His Game 7 record of 6-10 will be the subject of plenty of discussion over the coming days, and rightly or wrongly, will no doubt have plenty of aggrieved Sixers fans politely suggesting their team finds a new coach.  Incidentally, after LeBron James’ historic performance in 2012, the Heat went on to win Game 7 and with it the series, before beating the Oklahoma City Thunder in five games to win the championship.

But a flurry of hard hit balls and two big innings from its senior leaders allowed it to crawl back and earn the decisive victory.  The Wolverines (26-22 overall, 13-8 Big Ten) prevailed on senior day behind the power of their bats to sweep Northwestern (8-38, 3-18) by a score of 15-5.  Coming off of a Big Ten Pitcher of the Week performance against Minnesota, senior left-hander Jacob Denner looked to stay hot on the mound. But, stymied early by the Wildcats’ offense, Michigan entered an early hole, giving up two runs quickly in the first inning.  With Denner unable to replicate his dominance from a week ago in the early innings, the Wolverines needed their bats to keep them in the game — and they delivered. In the bottom of the third inning the bats unleashed, as back-to-back doubles from graduate shortstop Cody Jefferis and senior second baseman Ted Burton drove in two RBI to bring Michigan within one run.  “I like a hot Teddy,” Michigan coach Tracy Smith said. “When he’s hot, he’s fun to watch. That’s what your older guys are supposed to do, is lead by example and through their play. He’s doing an excellent job of that.”  But the best was still to come for the Wolverines.  The next inning, senior third baseman Brandon Lawrence ignited a two-out onslaught with an RBI single, followed by home runs from Jefferis and Burton — Jefferis’ first homer of the season and Burton’s third in just this series. Michigan entered the bottom of the fourth down by one, but exited up by four.  After the early blows, the Wolverines used the crucial bottom of the fourth inning to retake all momentum, only needing to close out the rest of the game — and series.  Continuing that momentum, Denner’s pitching began to smooth, allowing just two more runs in the top of the seventh before handing off to senior right-hander John Torroella with a three run Michigan lead.  “Even with the hits, (Denner) didn’t give up much solid contact,” Smith said. “Following up his unbelievable performance from last week is what we’re gonna need him to do.”  While not equal to his career best performance last weekend, Denner still kept the Wolverines in position to hold their lead.  While the lead was safe at the time of Denner’s exit, it needed insurance. And that is where Jefferis re-enters the equation.  With the bases loaded in the bottom of the eighth inning, the senior roped a triple down the right field line. The hit scored all three runners, bolstering a six-run inning to close out a cycle performance at the plate for Jefferis.  “That really spread it open there,” Smith said. “Not only did it give him the cycle, but we were just saying, ‘Gosh, we need one more run just to kind of get away,’ … so the triple was big.”  He delivered the knockout shot. By piling on six runs in the seventh inning, Michigan had replicated and gone beyond what it did in its dominant fourth inning. The game was no longer in reach for Northwestern and the Wolverines achieved their lead on the backs of their seniors.  Earning the series sweep against the Wildcats is essential to Michigan’s hopes of another Big Ten Tournament run. And the final victory on Sunday shows that the Wolverines’ bats are heating up at just the right time.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pY2hpZ2FuZGFpbHkuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9iYXNlYmFsbC9iaWctaW5uaW5ncy1hbmQtdmV0ZXJhbi1wZXJmb3JtYW5jZXMtZWFybi1taWNoaWdhbi1zd2VlcC1hZ2FpbnN0LW5vcnRod2VzdGVybi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The 6-foot-3 Lewis, a 2024 four-star point guard who received an Orange scholarship offer in late April, has put up several massive performances this weekend in grassroots basketball. That’s after he displayed his elite scoring prowess last month amid two NCAA live periods on the AAU circuit.  In his first two games this weekend, Lewis combined for 55 points in just 48 minutes of total action. He led his squad, the Oakland, Calif.-based Oakland Soldiers in Nike’s EYBL league, to a pair of blowout wins.  2024 Oakland Soldiers (CA) G Mikey Lewis (@MikeyLewis05): 29 PTS (5 3PTM), 5 REB, 2 AST in a win over The Family @Soldiers_Salute #EYBL Top performers ⤵️https://t.co/2gG4Pvehr5 pic.twitter.com/ANTGDWYp0Y — The Circuit (@TheCircuit) May 13, 2023  So far this spring in grassroots basketball, Lewis has proven one of the top all-around performers across all of the shoe-sponsored AAU leagues.  Syracuse basketball 2024 four-star target Mikey Lewis is a scoring machine.  This past Friday through Sunday, the EYBL is holding its third spring session at the Southwest Athletic Center in Carrollton, Texas.

"explosion","2023-05-05","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Sun 14 May 2023 22:02:32","Scientists say they have observed a dying star swallowing a planet for the first time.  Astronomers recently reported the observation of what appeared to be a large gas planet being eaten up by its aging star. The team said the sun-like star had been expanding for a very long time and finally got so big that it swallowed the nearby planet.  The researchers who made the observations said the star is in our Milky Way galaxy, about 12,000 light years from Earth. A light year is the distance light travels in a year – about 9.5 trillion kilometers. The findings were recently reported in a study published in Nature.  Most planets are believed to meet the end of their life when the star they are orbiting runs out of energy. This process causes the star to turn into a “red giant” that grows very large. The star can then swallow up the planet, and anything else that nears it.  The scientists say the planet’s destruction happened between 10,000 and 15,000 years ago near the Aquila constellation. At that time, the star was around 10 billion years old. The team said the swallowing event created a hot explosion of light, followed by a large release of dust that shot out into space.  Kishalay De is a researcher from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He discovered the light explosion by accident in 2020. He was examining data captured by the Palomar Observatory, based near San Diego, California.  De said he was surprised to observe a star that had suddenly increased in brightness by more than 100 times over a period of 10 days. He had been searching for binary star systems. These are sets of two stars that orbit around a common center of mass. When the larger of the stars takes bites out of the other, a bright explosion called an “outburst” happens.  But De said his examinations suggested the outburst was surrounded by cold gas, meaning it could not be a binary system. He learned from another space telescope that the star had also started releasing large amounts of dust months before the outburst.  While scientists had observed past star expansions, this was the first time they have been able to observe a complete planet-swallowing event.  The researchers said the collected data showed the swallowed planet was a “gas giant” with a similar mass to the planet Jupiter. They noted that the planet had become so close to its star that it could complete a full orbit in just one day.  The planet is believed to have “engulfed” the planet over a period of around 100 days, the team said. The bright explosion happened in the final 10 days as the planet was totally destroyed.  Miguel Montarges is an astronomer at the Paris Observatory who was not involved in the research. He told the French news agency AFP the star was thousands of degrees hotter than the planet when the destruction happened. He explained, ""It's like putting an ice cube into a boiling pot.""  Astronomers say the same event is expected to happen to other planets – including Mercury, Venus and Earth. De said our sun will likely reach its red giant period in about 5 billion years.  Astronomers do not know if more planets are circling the star at a safer distance. If so, De said they may have thousands of years before also getting swallowed up.  Now that they know what to look for, the researchers will be looking for more similar events. They believe thousands of planets around other stars will likely suffer the same fate as this one did.  Morgan MacLeod is a postdoctoral researcher at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Massachusetts. He told Reuters news agency he finds it “humbling” to think about our own planet facing the same destruction. MacLeod noted that since Earth is much smaller, its destruction will not cause such an outburst.  “When Earth is eventually swallowed, the sun will hardly notice,"" he said.  I’m Bryan Lynn.

"explosion","2023-05-10","Not Discerned","{""Lagos"", ""Lagos"", ""Nigeria""}","Sun 14 May 2023 23:28:40","Cooking Gas  By Elizabeth Adegbesan  Nigerians have been given to improvisations since the turn of inflation and the economic crisis.  Most of the improvisations have saved them money and helped to keep heads above water.  However, the new way of boycotting the high cost of cooking gas cylinders may cost lives than it can save money.  Economy&Lifestyle discovered that the cost of gas cylinders has risen so high that it becomes difficult for average homes to afford and still fill them with gas.  The situation becomes worse when considering that the pump price of kerosene, which would have been an alternative, is prohibitive.  Checks show that the price of cylinders varies according to the sizes. A 3kg gas cylinder costs N14,000, 5kg-N16,000 6kg – N17,000 and 12.5kg costs N19,000. Filling the cylinders with cooking gas also costs N2,600 for 3kg, N5,200 for 6kg, N8,950 for 10.5kg and N10,650 for 12.5 kg.  This means that an average home with a worn-out 5kg will need N20,250 to buy a new one and fill it, which is hard to come by.  So, the resolve is to refurbish the old ones and still manage them. However, that is where the danger is.  Mrs. Rukayat Adesoji, a trader, said her gas cylinder got rusted and no longer stands erect since last month, but due to high cost of purchasing the cylinders, she took it to a welder who patched the legs, repainted it, and since then, she has been using it.  “My gas cylinder which was 6kg got rusted and no longer stands erect since last month. When I asked for the price, I was told it was N17, 500. I was discussing it with a friend who advised me to take it to a welder to paint it and construct a new stand. I heeded to her advice and at the end spent just N3, 000 to turn my cooking gas to a brand new.”  Apart from refurbishing cylinders, some people don’t even know when their cylinders will expire. Mrs. Mercy Opara, a hair stylist, fell in that category as she explained: “I am taking my gas cylinder to the welder to spray it for me. It just cost N1, 500. The cost of buying a new cylinder is high. I have been using my cylinder for over 7 years and I don’t even know the expiry date. I just pray God blesses me so that I can buy a new one. But this one I am managing will look neat after spraying it for another two years.”  Mr. Adekanbi Joseph, a wielder, said he paints cylinder and “To paint and rebuild a cylinder stand, I charge N4, 500. Many people come here to paint as a new cylinder is now very expensive to get.”  Explaining the danger in using refurbished cylinders, The Chief Executive Officer, FKT Cooking gas and general goods, Mr. Benjamin Hope said: “A brand new cylinder can explode if the locks are not well keyed after using and if the cylinder filled with gas was moved from one place.  “There are many reasons for the high cost of gas cylinders in Nigeria. One is the cost of importation due to the exchange rate. Another is the increased migration from the use of kerosene to cooking gas which has necessitated increased demand for gas cylinders.  “You know that in such a case there will be increased importation of cylinders.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhbmd1YXJkbmdyLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1L3JlZnVyYmlzaGVkLWdhcy1jeWxpbmRlcnMtbmV4dC1ib21icy13YWl0aW5nLXRvLWV4cGxvZGUv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudmFuZ3VhcmRuZ3IuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvcmVmdXJiaXNoZWQtZ2FzLWN5bGluZGVycy1uZXh0LWJvbWJzLXdhaXRpbmctdG8tZXhwbG9kZS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

While the Celtics were on the ropes in the fourth quarter and needed both a late Jayson Tatum explosion and Sixers collapse to win, the move undoubtedly worked given Boston’s fast start to the game and Williams’ plus-18 in the box score. Because of this, it’s no surprise Mazzulla is sticking with this lineup for Sunday’s Game 7.  Mazzulla spoke to the media before the do-or-die game and confirmed he will keep the two-big starting lineup in place against Joel Embiid and Co., per ESPN’s Tim Bontemps. That means it will be Williams, Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart and Al Horford going up against Philly.  Williams played 28 minutes in Game 6, his highest playing time of the series. The big man was under 20 minutes in the prior three games and had played a high of 22 points in Game 2 before Game 6. He made his presence known with 10 points, nine rebounds and two blocks in those 28 minutes. And, again, the Celtics outscored the Sixers by 18 points when Williams was on the court.
