The Elon Musk-led company has requested a six-month window from June 15 to December 15 to launch a Starship prototype to Earth’s orbit from the company’s Starbase facility in Boca Chica, Texas, according to the application. The FCC regulates all spacecraft communication in Earth’s orbit. SpaceX hasn’t said whether Starship’s second orbital launch attempt will carry any payload, but said in Monday’s application an FCC “special temporary authority” is necessary for the mission. Before going interplanetary, Starship will first be used as a regular launch vehicle to send SpaceX’s Starlink satellites and other payloads to Earth’s orbit. To actually launch, SpaceX will also need permission from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which issues rocket launch licenses.  Starship’s first orbital test exploded  SpaceX attempted the first orbital launch of Starship on April 20 from Boca Chica. A nearly 400-foot-tall rocket prototype, comprised of an upper stage called SN20 and a Super Heavy booster, lifted off successfully and soared to about 20 miles in the sky before blowing up. The explosion damaged the rocket’s launch pad and scattered debris and dust for miles from the launch site.  The result wasn’t a complete surprise. Musk said before the launch there was only a 50 percent chance of Starship reaching orbit on the first attempt. He considered the test a success and tweeted that the SpaceX team “learned a lot for [the] next test launch in a few months.”  FAA is conducting a “mishap investigation” into Starship’s first test launch. It’s part of a standard procedure following an anomaly during a rocket launch such as an explosion."

Officers arrested L'Donpatrick Bones, 42, in a room at the Days Inn at 901 Fair Park Ave. around 9:50 p.m., about three hours after they discovered the explosive components during a traffic stop near 5322 Asher Ave.  Police said they identified Bones as the possible owner of the components after interviewing the two people in the vehicle during the stop, Barry Poindexter, 45, and Brittany Brown, 29. Officers pulled over Poindexter because he was observed speeding, and he told them he did not have a valid license, police said.  A search of the vehicle located containers of a crystalline substance and a bag containing a yellow cord connected to a silver object that the officers recognized as a blasting cap, police said. Police cleared the area while Little Rock Fire Department bomb squad technicians examined the items.  The technicians identified the substance as ammonium nitrate and nitro methane connected to a commercial-grade blasting cap and declared the scene safe.  Ammonium nitrate is a component in explosives used in mining and construction. Nitro methane is also explosive and is also a component in the fuel used by drag racing cars. Blasting caps serve as ignition sources for larger explosive charges.  Poindexter and Brown were released to Maumelle police, where they had active warrants, after questioning and did not face any charges in the incident Saturday, a police incident report states.  Bones was at the motel with three other people when police arrived and arrested him, police said. More drugs and a gun were found in the room, police said.  One of the people with Bones, Kristen Davis, had a warrant out for her arrest and was being held in the Pulaski County jail Tuesday, an online inmate roster showed. Another, Arstra Malone, refused to identify herself and was arrested on a charge of obstructing governmental operations, police said. She did not appear on the inmate roster Tuesday.  Bones faces felony charges of committing criminal acts involving explosives, possession of a firearm by a certain person, simultaneous possession of drugs and a gun, trafficking fentanyl, possession of drug paraphernalia and four counts of possession of drugs with intent to distribute. He was being held in the Pulaski County jail Tuesday evening in lieu of $75,00 bond, an online inmate roster showed.    "

OpenAI's powerful language model, ChatGPT, has become a widely-used tool in this regard, shedding light on potential high performers in the crypto landscape.  In this article, we'll explore five promising cryptocurrencies that, per ChatGPT's analysis, are poised for explosive growth this year.  1. AiDoge ($AI)  The first crypto that ChatGPT is heavily bullish on is AiDoge ($AI) – an AI-powered meme generation platform built on the Ethereum blockchain.  AiDoge's compelling use cases have attracted investor attention, meaning the project has now raised over $8.6 million in funding through its ongoing presale.  Investors are excited by the potential applications for AiDoge's meme generator, which looks to streamline the process of creating hilarious images for social media platforms like Twitter and Reddit.  Additionally, AiDoge's earnings protocol rewards meme creators with $AI, the platform's native ERC-20 token, for generating images that resonate with the wider community.  The combination of these features has piqued the interest of crypto-savvy investors – but what does ChatGPT think?  Per ChatGPT's analysis, the $AI token's value could rise to $0.00336 by the end of 2023 – representing a 100x return for those who invest at the intended exchange listing price of $0.0000336.  This bullish forecast will be great news for early AiDoge.com investors. Fortunately for those not yet involved, AiDoge's presale is still ongoing – with $AI tokens currently priced at $0.0000308.  Visit AiDoge Presale  2. yPredict ($YPRED)  Another project that's making waves in the crypto market is yPredict ($YPRED) . This Polygon-based ecosystem looks to revolutionize digital asset investors' research and analysis process by providing a comprehensive suite of advanced tools and features.  The yPredict ecosystem boasts features such as automatic pattern recognition, advanced technical indicators, AI-powered price forecasts, and investor sentiment analysis.  On top of all that, yPredict's platform will also have a predictive model marketplace, where AI specialists can market their creations, allowing retail investors to access them for a monthly or annual fee.  This fee will be paid in $YPRED – yPredict's native ERC-20 token. Although transactions will be $YPRED's primary use case, token holders can also stake their holdings and generate regular rewards.  Like with AiDoge, ChatGPT appears optimistic about yPredict's prospects. As noted by ChatGPT, positive fundamentals and a bullish crypto market could help the $YPRED price increase post-launch.  As such, ChatGPT estimates that $YPRED could hit $1.20 by the end of 2023 – which would be a 900% increase from the expected listing price.  However, ChatGPT also highlights the looming threat of regulatory change – a factor that could hamper the progress of many new crypto projects, including yPredict.  Visit yPredict Presale  3. Ecoterra ($ECOTERRA)  Ecoterra ($ECOTERRA) is an eco-friendly crypto project that seeks to reward individuals and businesses for being more sustainable.  The project's flagship feature is its ""Recycle2Earn"" app, which provides tokenized rewards every time a user recycles glass, plastic, cardboard, and other materials. These rewards are distributed in $ECOTERRA – the project's native token.  Alongside this Recycle2Earn app, the Ecoterra ecosystem will also have a carbon offset marketplace where individuals and businesses can buy offsets to reduce their carbon footprint.  Ecoterra goes beyond just tokenized rewards for recycling; it will also host a marketplace for recycled materials. This marketplace will enable businesses to conveniently acquire used resources, offering payment options in $ECOTERRA and other prominent cryptocurrencies.  Given the pressing threat of global warming, the need for sustainability-focused crypto projects like Ecoterra is higher than ever.  This could contribute to the demand for $ECOTERRA tokens once the project's presale ends – with ChatGPT forecasting that the token's value could soar as high as $0.50 by the end of 2023.  Considering prospective investors can buy $ECOTERRA tokens for $0.00775 during Stage 6 of the presale phase, this presents a unique opportunity for a substantial return on investment, should ChatGPT's forecast prove accurate.  Visit Ecoterra Presale  4. Polygon ($MATIC)  Polygon ($MATIC) is a blockchain platform that aims to create a multi-chain system that can be integrated with the Ethereum network.  The Polygon platform is fast, secure, and scalable – making it an appealing option for the developers of large decentralized applications (dApps).  Moreover, Polygon uses a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which is significantly more energy-efficient than the proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism used by chains like Bitcoin and Dogecoin.  Although the price of $MATIC, Polygon's native token, has fallen substantially since late February, ChatGPT remains optimistic about its prospects.  According to ChatGPT, the $MATIC price could return to $1.70 by the end of 2023 – a level that hasn't been seen since March 2022.  For this to occur, ChatGPT states that Polygon would need to continue its mission of scaling Ethereum transactions and growing the number of dApps that utilize the network.  5. Kaspa ($KAS)  Last but not least is Kaspa ($KAS). Kaspa is a PoW cryptocurrency that uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) protocol, meaning blocks can be created in parallel, providing scope for super-quick transaction speeds.  Through this system, Kaspa aims to be a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) payment system that can outmatch Bitcoin in terms of scalability.  Moreover, the Kaspa project is entirely open-source, and the mainnet was launched with no pre-mining – meaning that no single entity has control over the $KAS token supply.  This has undoubtedly contributed to ChatGPT's positivity around the project. Per ChatGPT, the $KAS price could reverse its current downtrend and reach $0.475 by the end of the year – a price increase of 150%.  However, as with all of ChatGPT's predictions, the chatbot does urge caution – as factors like market conditions, adoption rates, and roadmap delays could impact any bullish price forecast.

Marathon said the cause of the Monday morning fire was under investigation. Aerial footage from Houston television stations showed crews trying to put out flames at the Galveston Bay refinery, which is along a stretch of Texas coast that is heavily populated by petrochemical facilities.  Neither the company nor authorities immediately said whether anyone else was injured.  “The safety of our workers and the community is our top priority, and a full investigation will be conducted to determine the cause of the incident,” Marathon said in a statement.  Fires at refineries in the area are not uncommon. Earlier this month, a fire at a Shell facility in nearby Deer Park sent nine workers to the hospital and caused massive plumes of smoke.  In March, an explosion and fire at a facility owned by INEOS Phenol in nearby Pasadena, Texas, left one injured.  The fire comes after a 2005 explosion – one of the worst refinery explosions in U.S. history – left 15 dead and 180 others injured at this same facility, which was then owned by BP. It was sold to Marathon in 2013, renamed the Galveston Bay refinery and in 2018 merged with another Marathon facility to become what it is today, according to previous statements by BP and Marathon.

The study, which was the first to test an AI voice-based virtual coach for behavioral therapy, found changes in patients’ brain activity along with improved depression and anxiety symptoms after using Lumen, an AI voice assistant that delivered a form of psychotherapy.  The UIC team says the results, which are published in the journal Translational Psychiatry, offer encouraging evidence that virtual therapy can play a role in filling the gaps in mental health care, where waitlists and disparities in access are often hurdles that patients, particularly from vulnerable communities, must overcome to receive treatment.  “We’ve had an incredible explosion of need, especially in the wake of COVID, with soaring rates of anxiety and depression and not enough practitioners,” said Dr. Olusola A. Ajilore, UIC professor of psychiatry and co-first author of the paper. “This kind of technology may serve as a bridge. It’s not meant to be a replacement for traditional therapy, but it may be an important stop-gap before somebody can seek treatment.”  Lumen, which operates as a skill in the Amazon Alexa application, was developed by Ajilore and study senior author Dr. Jun Ma, the Beth and George Vitoux Professor of Medicine at UIC, along with collaborators at Washington University in St. Louis and Pennsylvania State University, with the support of a $2 million grant from the National Institute of Mental Health.  The UIC researchers recruited over 60 patients for the clinical study exploring the application’s effect on mild-to-moderate depression and anxiety symptoms, and activity in brain areas previously shown to be associated with the benefits of problem-solving therapy.  Two-thirds of the patients used Lumen on a study-provided iPad for eight problem-solving therapy sessions, with the rest serving as a “waitlist” control receiving no intervention.  After the intervention, study participants using the Lumen app showed decreased scores for depression, anxiety and psychological distress compared with the control group. The Lumen group also showed improvements in problem-solving skills that correlated with increased activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a brain area associated with cognitive control. Promising results for women and underrepresented populations also were found.  “It’s about changing the way people think about problems and how to address them, and not being emotionally overwhelmed,” Ma said. “It’s a pragmatic and patient-driven behavior therapy that’s well established, which makes it a good fit for delivery using voice-based technology.”  A larger trial comparing the use of Lumen with both a control group on a waitlist, and patients receiving human-coached problem-solving therapy is currently being conducted by the researcher. They stress that the virtual coach doesn’t need to perform better than a human therapist to fill a desperate need in the mental health system.  “The way we should think about digital mental health service is not for these apps to replace humans, but rather to recognize what a gap we have between supply and demand, and then find novel, effective and safe ways to deliver treatments to individuals who otherwise do not have access, to fill that gap,” Ma said.  Co-first author of the study is Thomas Kannampallil at Washington University in St. Louis.  Other co-investigators include Aifeng Zhang, Nan Lv, Nancy E. Wittels, Corina R. Ronneberg, Vikas Kumar, Susanth Dosala, Amruta Barve, Kevin C. Tan, Kevin K. Cao, Charmi R. Patel and Emily A. Kringle, all of UIC; Joshua Smyth and Jillian A. Johnson at Pennsylvania State University; and Lan Xiao at Stanford University."

The bird did not survive.  The unusual incident - and unfortunate one for lovers of ornithology -- was strangely familiar to the Diamondbacks, as it immediately invoked memories of one of the team's -- and MLB's -- most bizarre pitching highlights. During a spring training game in 2001, Diamondbacks Hall of Fame pitcher Randy Johnson famously hit a bird while on the mound, obliterating the bird in an explosion of feathers.  The incident with Gallen's bird was much less dramatic, as the bird would only fall to the ground as his pitch was redirected.  The incident with Gallen was the latest in a select few examples of the ballpark being a perilous place for birds. In 1985, for instance, New York Yankees star Dave Winfield hit and killed a seagull while warming up in the middle of the fifth inning.  Gallen enters Wednesday's game having had a strong season so far, with a 2.35 ERA, 6-1 record, 0.855 WHIP and 70 strikeouts in 57 1/3 innings across nine starts.Gallen's WHIP mark is currently the best in the National League."

Out September 15th on [PIAS], and recently named one of the most anticipated albums of summer by Pitchfork, the ten-song collection is connected through themes of hopeless devotion, infatuation and overwhelming obsession, presented as the ideal soundtrack for long walks through city streets. Whereas lead singer and songwriter Ian Devaney imagines the band's 2020 debut, Introduction, Presence, as taking place in a car – and second album A Way Forward occurring on and as a locomotive – Strange Disciple is, at last, ambulatory and wayfaring, informed by the excitement of exploring new places the Brooklyn trio never thought they would see or play during their remarkable pandemic-era breakout. Clamoring with a propulsive kraut-punk groove and bouncing bassline, ""Stumbling Still"" encapsulates that form of forward motion, with lyrics that deliver an equally restless but far less healthy series of incessant thoughts and internal strife. Listen to ""Stumbling Still"" Here Premiered via KCRW, ""Stumbling Still"" arrives on the heels of the soaring ""Sole Obsession,"" which ""cloaks its emotional vulnerability in an avalanche of synthesizer and a rapid tempo"" (Billboard), as well as album opener ""Weak In Your Light,"" hailed as both an ""excellent exploration of passion and agony"" and a ""subdued re-introduction to the best synth-pop band in the world"" (Paste). Through Devaney's towering vocal performance, he fluctuates between fixation and shame, bringing the listener down a turbulent path of self-exploration and showing that one should not shy away from the brief pain necessary to make a much-needed change. Like the rest of Strange Disciple, ""Stumbling Still"" was produced by Nick Millhiser (Holy Ghost!, LCD Soundsystem), and recorded in his East Williamsburg studio, as it sees Nation of Language considering the creative choices that would be most compelling to perform on-stage, for the first time. Incorporating more live drums, guitar and shoegaze influences into their arrangements than ever before, the band expand their new wave, post-punk and synth-powered sound with newfound fervor. Ahead of Pitchfork Festival, Primavera Sound, Outside Lands and nearly 60 more US, UK and EU performances that Nation of Language have already announced for 2023, the band are just beginning to debut music from Strange Disciple live. Earlier this month, during an unforgettable night documented by Rolling Stone, they headlined their largest hometown show to date at Brooklyn Steel. As Consequence praised, ""Nation of Language put star power on display...each entrancing track was perfectly executed, and now they've got us hungry for more."" Tonight the band headlines LA's Fonda Theatre, before two sold-out stops in Seattle this week, each with support from Reggie Watts.

A State Fire Marshal report of the April 10 fire at the Southfork Dairy Farm about 50 miles (80 kilometers) southwest of Amarillo did not determine what caused the engine fire, but found there was “no intentional act to cause a failure.” The April 24 report said the investigation was closed.  A worker driving the truck through a section of the 2 million-square-foot barn told investigators he noticed what he first thought was steam coming from the engine compartment. He tried to drive out of the barn when he realized it was a fire, but couldn’t make it.  The driver said he tried to put out the fire with two extinguishers but failed. Several other employees told investigators they rushed to help, but the fire quickly spread.  The report noted the dairy farm had a second manure hauling truck on the property outside of the barn. A dairy manager told investigators it too had previously burned. The report noted burn marks near the engine compartment consistent with the truck fire inside the barn.

Continuing the trend that started earlier this year, more and more meme coins are pumping and wreaking havoc on the market. Apparently, there is something about meme coins that makes people more than eager to buy as many as they can.  However, investors are eyeing these tokens with suspicions and many of them are opting for more secure options, like AiDoge (AI) and SpongeBobBob (SPONGE). Both of these tokens represent a far better opportunity, focused on the future rather than instant pump-and-dump schemes.  >>> Buy AiDoge Now<<<  HOMER Is A Token With No Promises, No Roadmap, And No Usefulness  Dubbed the DOH Coin, HOMER is a meme coin based on the famous Homer Simpson character. The token made quite a splash on Dexscanner, coming in second with only ETH performing better. This massive success came on the heels of a troublesome presale, which makes it even more impressive.  The HOMER presale ran into troubles almost as soon as it started. Poor security led to a massive bot attack that paralyzed the network and caused a lot of trouble for developers. Regardless, they weren’t deterred and decided to punch through.  The daily trading volume confirmed that their decision was the right one, as people seemingly can’t get enough of HOMER tokens. For the last several days, 24-hour trading volume is constantly north of 440 million, pushing the price upward.  As with most meme coins, HOMER doesn’t have any utility or purpose for that matter. Its value depends solely on the hype its community can create. That is the biggest concern major investors shave about the token and the reason why so many of them decided to opt out and look for better alternatives for investing.  >>> Buy AiDoge Now<<<  SAUDI PEPE – The Arabian Version of Popular Pepe Coin Is Pumping  Pumping more than 1,400% in just one day, Saudi Pepe is among the best-performing cryptocurrencies on the market. Mimicking the token it was named after, Saudi Pepe is performing miraculously on the market, spurring a mad dash among the investors to catch it before it peaks out.  Saudi Pepe is a community project that plays heavily on FOMO in people who missed out on the original Pepe Coin. Judging by the enormous spike in both value and trading volume, the strategy seems to be working exceedingly well. Investors from all over the world are rushing to crypto exchanges and gobbling up the token.  However, some experts warn that not everything is ideal. In fact, there are several glaring red flags that are preventing whales from jumping on board. First is the lack of any info on the team behind the project. Second, and perhaps even more important, is the fear of yet another pump-and-dump scheme, with several anonymous wallets holding huge numbers of the token. If dumped all at once, the price will take a nosedive, leaving smaller investors holding the bag.  >>> Buy SpongeBob Token Now<<<  AiDoge Breaks All Records Raising over $8 Million in Presale  The AI craze sparked by ChatGPT has reached the crypto market in a form of a fun and entertaining app called AiDoge. For some, using a tool as powerful as an AI for generating memes may seem frivolous, but only to those who do not understand the importance of memes in modern online communication. Not only are they an accepted lingua franca for younger generations across the globe, but they are also entertaining.  Creating memes with AiDoge is very simple. All you need is an idea to type in the console and the powerful AI under the hood will do the rest. It will search the net for appropriate images, devise text, and offer you a finished product you can instantly share with your friends.  AiDoge will also feature a handy Meme2Earn function, allowing the best memes to be rewarded with AIDOGE tokens. This will provide the best creators with a source of income and yet another reason to use the app.  The fact that the AIDOGE presale already raised over $8 million in mere weeks is a testament to how popular the concept is. Based on this, many experts predict that AIDOGE will be the next meme coin to explode in 2023, as soon as it hits the open market.  >>> Buy SpongeBob Token Now<<<  SPONGE May Be The Next Big Thing for Meme Coins  SpongeBob token was launched on May 4th and by May 7th it pumped 3179.45%, making it one of the best-performing tokens on the market. For comparison’s sake, in the same period, Pepe Coin gained 271%, vastly underperforming compared to SpongeBob.  Based on the SpongeBobBob SquarePants cartoon character, SpongeBob token followed an unorthodox path to fame. It had a stealth launch on Uniswap DEX, but the word of mouth quickly spread and the token found its way to CoinMarketCap. Just on its first day, SpongeBob gained more than 2,000% for its early investors.  The SpongeBob community is extremely well organized, creating a huge online presence early on. Its Twitter account already has more than 40k followers. The social media campaign was successfully leveraged to incur even higher gains, ending up with SpongeBob’s explosion.  Some experts claim that this is only the beginning. Even though SpongeBob has cooled off some in the last few days, it still remains one of the most prospective meme coins on the market. We can easily see it repeating its amazing gains before the end of 2023.  >>> Buy SpongeBob Token Now<<<  Conclusion  Despite spectacular performances from both Homer and Saudi Pepe, we wouldn’t recommend investing in either of them. There are simply too many unclear issues about these tokens and this lack of transparency is usually a clear indicator of some nefarious intentions. If you are looking for good meme coin investment options, AI and SPONGE are clearly far superior options in every regard."

Noah Calderon, 22, made his first court appearance this week for a federal charge of possession of a destructive device, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Texas said in a news release Tuesday detailing the investigation.  Prosecutors said the FBI was first alerted to Calderon in October after he allegedly posted about white supremacist ideology and a fascination with high-profile mass shootings, ""particularly the 1999 massacre at Columbine High School,"" the statement read.  Calderon's social media included pictures of himself in tactical-style vests with AR-15-style rifles and handguns along with Columbine-themed memes, prosecutors said.  ""This defendant exhibited several indicators of potential violence: a fascination with mass shooters, an obsession with weapons, and hatred towards a protected class. What's worse, he had allegedly progressed from ideation to planning and preparation,"" U.S. Attorney Leigha Simonton said in the news release.  Months later in March, the FBI received a tip that Calderon had detonated a homemade bomb in a residential neighborhood. The explosion prompted several 911 calls about a loud concussive sound and smoke.  ""Shortly thereafter, agents reviewed Mr. Calderon's Google account and found searches for the Columbine killers, the Charleston church shooter, 'pipe bomb how to make,' 'how to make propane bombs,' and 'wear [sic] were the propane bombs in Columbine,' as well as searches of the names of several local public schools. They also searched e-commerce activity, which showed that Mr. Calderon allegedly bought two pounds of potassium perchlorate, one pound of aluminum powder, and a striped fuse online,"" the release said.  A man is in custody and facing weapons charges after a search of his home Monday raised concerns of a potential explosion risk and prompted evacuations.  Calderon was taken into custody in April after Burleson Police and the FBI raided his home and found ""items that could be used to make and detonate a bomb."" Among the evidence taken from the home was a glass jar marked ""frag,"" which contained metal BBs and lead, and 659.2 grams of explosive powder, the release said.  Investigators also found what they described as a handwritten ""manifesto"" which ""glorified the Columbine shooters and espoused white supremacy,"" the release said.  NBC 5 News Investigators search a home along the 700 block of Pecan Street in Burleson, Monday, April 17, 2023.  ""In apprehending Mr. Calderon, we may have averted mass tragedy. We are especially grateful to the tipster who alerted law enforcement to Mr. Calderon's concerning social media posts,"" Simonton stated.  Calderon was charged on April 18 and indicted on May 10 on one count of possession of a destructive device. He made his initial appearance before U.S. Magistrate Judge Jeffrey L. Cureton on Monday.  He faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted.  Burleson Police Noah Calderon, 22, booking photo."

However, both times, the Wolverines lost in the semifinal. Now, there are concerns that to take the next step forward, Michigan needs to be more explosive in the passing game.  Offensive coordinator Sherrone Moore agreed with that sentiment, explaining that the team has been working on being more consistent this spring.  “I think we have areas that we need to fix, things that we need to be able to exploit defenses more,” Sherrone Moore said. “And we’ve got to be more consistent, whether that’s ball placement, catches, all those things and that just gives you more confidence when you gameplan and things.”  In 2022, Michigan relied heavily on its running game, throwing for just 219.9 yards per game. That was 83rd in the country for that stat.  “And I think in the spring we fixed a lot of those areas, which is really gonna help us when we get to the fall.”  Despite the team struggling to gain yards in the passing game, Sherrone Moore and Michigan are expecting quarterback JJ McCarthy is going to show a lot of improvement in 2022.  “First thing is confidence,” Moore said.  “Just his confidence. He was always a quiet confident kid. But now you can see it zoomed in the way he just walks around, the way he approaches the film room, the way he walks on the field. When he gets out of the huddle, or he looks to the sideline for a play, like the dude just looks like he’s dynamic. Just in the way he approaches everything.”  Sherrone Moore on the potential of Michigan’s wide receivers  JJ McCarthy is going to need some help in the passing game from Michigan’s wide receivers. Luckily, Sherrone Moore thinks the Michigan wide receivers have as much potential as anyone.  “They have potential to be as good as any group in the country. It’s just on the continual work habits that they have, and what they’ve been doing. CJ [Cornelius Johnson] had an outstanding spring. Fixed some things that we wanted him to fix. We put him in a couple different positions to see how he would manage, and he’s just a smart football player, savvy football player. Roman [Wilson] continues to be Roman. Fast, explosive, doing all the things he’s doing. And then exciting to get AJ [Henning] back,” Moore said.  “The other guy that showed up obviously in the spring in Peyton O’Leary, you know who really, really stood out, and he did that all spring. So excited to see him get his chances and roll, and just keep rolling with this group. The young receivers are super dynamic and exciting, so excited for the future of this group and where they are.”"

Given the optimism, it could be wise to add fundamentally strong coal stocks Peabody Energy Corporation (BTU), Alpha Metallurgical Resources, Inc. (AMR), and CONSOL Energy Inc. (CEIX) to your portfolio, trading at discounted valuations.  Over the past year, the coal sector gained traction due to geopolitical tensions and unprecedented economic conditions. The Russian-Ukraine war and the subsequent response from the United States and its allies have had a crippling impact on energy resources, boosting the demand for pivotal commodities globally.  The global coal market grew from $614.96 billion in 2022 to $621.89 billion in 2023 at a CAGR of 1.1%. Furthermore, the coal market is expected to grow to $658.68 billion in 2027 at a CAGR of 1.4%.  Even though some countries have rolled out climate strategies to decarbonize their economies over the coming decades, with gas shortages and a long road ahead to meet global demand for renewable energy, many continue to rely on coal for power and industry.  While coal use is expected to decrease in the long term, demand is set to remain robust in 2023, and consumption is set to hit an all-time high. Emerging and developing economies in Asia are set to increase coal use to help power their economic growth, even as they add more renewables, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).  Furthermore, the market’s continued correction has led to many quality stocks trading at reasonable valuations. Given the fundamental strength, it could be wise to invest in BTU, AMR, and CEIX to gain from their explosive upside. Moreover, these stocks also pay dividends, which is ideal for investors in this volatile market environment.  Peabody Energy Corporation (BTU)  BTU is a producer of metallurgical and thermal coal. It markets and brokers coal from other coal producers, trades coal and freight-related contracts, and partnered in a joint venture with the intent of developing various sites. The company operates through Seaborne Thermal Mining; Seaborne Metallurgical Mining; Powder River Basin Mining; and Other U.S. Thermal Mining segments.  On April 27, on the back of its strong financials, the company declared a quarterly dividend on its common stock of $0.075 per share, payable to its shareholders on May 31, 2023. BTU’s four-year average yield is 5.71%, while its annual dividend translates to a 1.41% yield on current prices.  In terms of forward non-GAAP P/E, BTU is trading at 3.21x, 62.6% lower than the industry average of 8.59x. Its forward EV/Sales multiple of 0.50x is 71.5% lower than the industry average of 1.76x. In addition, the stock’s forward EV/EBIT ratio of 2.10x compares to the industry average of 7.85x.  BTU’s revenue for the fiscal first quarter ended March 31, 2023, increased 97.3% year-over-year to $1.36 billion.

Two months after the disgraced Vanderpump Rules stars were caught for having a months-long affair by his (now former) girlfriend of nine years Ariana Madix, an insider has claimed that the duo has officially split.  “Raquel dipped out. Sandoval is not the one for her,” the source told Page Six.  The comment was a cheeky reference to Sandoval telling his fellow cast members that Leviss “dipped out” of his house during a recent Vanderpump Rules episode, causing confusion over whether or not she slept over. In case you missed it: she did.  And while performing a gig with his band Tom Sandoval and the Most Extras, he changed the lyrics to the iconic Fountains of Wayne song “Stacy’s Mom” to poke fun at Leviss, who is currently seeking treatment at a mental health facility.  Instead of singing, “Stacy can’t you see, you’re just not the girl for me,” the wannabe rockstar sang, “Schwartzy can’t you see, Raquel is not for me.”  Madix uncovered the affair in early March when she found a sexually explicit screen recording of Sandoval and her close friend on his phone. In a sneak peek for the show’s season finale — which airs tonight — the Something About Her owner reveals that Sandoval and Leviss first had sex in the former Sur waitress’s car shortly after Madix’s dog died.  Photo: Getty Images  “He didn’t have a key to get in so he had to ring the doorbell and I had to let him in,” Madix told her friends in the clip.  Despite Sandoval telling Howie Mandel that he and Leviss were “not putting any label” on their relationship, their co-stars seemed to believe that things were much more serious.  While Tom Schwartz found out about the one-night stand back in August 2022, it wasn’t until January 2023 that he said Sandoval admitted to being “in love” with Leviss.  “He’s addicted [to her],” Schwartz said during his off-the-walls Watch What Happens Live interview last month. “It’s an infatuation of all infatuations. Raquel is Tom’s heroin.”  Vanderpump Rules airs on Wednesday nights at 9/8c on Bravo."

Since the invasion, the South African government has been unwilling to demand that Russia unilaterally put an end to hostilities and withdraw its forces from the sovereign territory of its neighbor.  This is despite the fact that South African foreign policy is supposed to be conducted in accordance with the values and principles set forth in the constitution. This includes the advancement of human rights and promotion of democracy.  The South African government has not appeared especially bothered by this apparent contradiction in their international relations. From its perspective, it has assumed a reasonable stance in a world characterized by an “unequal application” of Western principles in armed conflicts and other insecure environments. To be fair, South Africa is not alone. Just ask India and Vietnam.  The Russian invasion of Ukraine has exposed the practical limits of the strategic partnership between South Africa and the United States. Recent events suggest those limits include the provisioning of military products and services to the Russian government and Russian private military contractors.  Now, questions have been raised as to whether the South African government crossed that line and, if so, does that count as a redline in the strategic partnership for the US government. While the world awaits the answers, it is important for regional observers to reflect on the series of events that led to this historic low in relations between South Africa and the United States.  That requires a rapid tracing of the series of events that led to US Ambassador, Reuben Brigety, going out and leveling public accusations against the African National Congress and the South African government. When viewed in this context, it becomes clear that the ambassador’s remarks are effectively an acknowledgment of the structural instabilities that exist in the strategic partnership between South Africa and the United States.  The Ramaphosa administration and Biden administration will need to mitigate those instabilities with haste. Otherwise, the strategic partnership could very well collapse before next year’s national elections in both countries. That is the reality.  US Ambassador Reuben Brigety suspects South Africa is doing deals with Russia. Image: Twitter  Contentious context  Last March, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa insinuated that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) instigated the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In his words, the “war could have been avoided if NATO had heeded the warnings from amongst its own leaders and officials over the years that its eastward expansion would lead to greater, not less, instability in the region.”  For that reason, he indicated that South Africa would not take “a very adversarial stance against Russia.” In October, the South African government went further. It gave permission to dock to a Russian superyacht that was under Western sanctions. This was justified on the grounds that the South African government does not have a “legal obligation to abide by sanctions” that are imposed by Western governments.  Last December, a Russian cargo ship was dispatched to South Africa. In the vicinity of Naval Base Simon’s Town, its crew may have switched off its maritime tracking system. Soon, local residents observed the Western-sanctioned vessel docked at the largest base of the South African Navy. There, local residents reported materials being loaded and unloaded the ship “under the cover of darkness.”  When questioned, Defense Spokesperson Kobus Marais responded that, to the best of his knowledge, the ship had docked to offload “an old, outstanding order for ammunition.” According to Julius Malema of the Economic Freedom Fights, there was nothing inappropriate with such a transfer since it is “consistent with international best practice to honor contractual trade obligations and relationships.”  A few weeks later, the African National Congress hosted its 55th National Conference. There, the African National Congress openly criticized American foreign policy. In the Resolution on International Relations, the African National Congress observed that “US-led expansionist military strategies” had resulted in “Western imperialist dominance over Eastern Europe.”  As an anti-imperialist and anti-colonial party, the African National Congress not only decried “a conspicuous failure of the current global institutions to resolve conflicts fairly, justly and equitably in order to safeguard the interests of all nations.” It went further. It concluded that the Russia-Ukrainian War was “provoked” by an American government pursuing an imperialist agenda that was informed by the Wolfowitz Doctrine.  In February, Airports Company South Africa proposed structural changes to its fueling operations at its airports. These changes were designed to separate refueling operations from thru-putting to ensure that “a sanctioned friend of the South African government” would receive “servicing and refueling” as needed.  This division was intended to break forced alignment “with the stance the oil companies’ headquarters and home countries take in terms of sanctions against Russia.” Note, this move followed at least two earlier incidents where international oil companies had actually refused to refuel the Russian aircraft under Western sanctions that had been granted permission to land at commercial airports in South Africa.  These refusals had angered some members of parliament from the African National Congress who demanded public assurances that the state-owned airport management company would not “indirectly impose” Western sanctions on Russia. After those assurances were given, Air BP decided to cease all operations in South Africa.  Around the same time, the South African government hosted a major military exercise between China, Russia, and South Africa. Those exercises coincided with the one year anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. They also involved the Russian frigate Admiral Gorshkov, which was armed with Zircon hypersonic missiles.  Prior to the exercises, there was an official visit by Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, with the South African Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, Naledi Pandor. On the sidelines, Minister Pandor stressed that it would be “an abuse of international practice” to prevent the South African government from conducting ”military exercises with friends.” In the end, the US government expressed public concern about the exercises.  South African Minister of International Relations Naledi Pandor (right) and her Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov shake hands before talks in Pretoria on January 23, 2022. Image: Screengrab / NDTV  The US Embassy in South Africa cautioned that the exercises would not only present the South African government with a diplomatic challenge. It would lead South Africans to ask whether their country should be “associated with the symbol ‘Z’ painted on the side of the frigate the Admiral Gorshkov.”  In April, a Russian cargo plane owned by an American-sanctioned company was permitted to land at Waterkloof Air Force Base. The plane purportedly delivered diplomatic mail to the Russian embassy.  However, the company reportedly has “handled cargo shipments for sanctioned Russian Federation defense entities” in the past. A few weeks later, Assistant Secretary for Arms Control, Verification and Compliance Mallory Stewart was dispatched to South Africa and Egypt.  Note, Egypt is another country where suspicions have been raised about illicit weapons transfers to Russia. Between May 9-10, Assistant Secretary Stewart held talks with senior government officials at the Department of International Relations and Cooperation Republic of South Africa. Around the same time, the main opposition party, Democratic Alliance, issued a public statement chastizing the African National Congress for abusing Air Force Base Waterkloof and Naval Base Simonstown for their “narrow political interests.”  They also submitted a Promotion of Access to Information Act (PAIA) application requesting the disclosure of “who authorized the landing at Waterkloof and the docking at the naval base, including the type of goods that were brought in and out.”  Heated accusations  On May 11, bilateral relations finally boiled over. During a press briefing, US Ambassador Reuben declared that “the South African government is in fact not not aligned” with Russia. This led to a rapid deterioration in the strategic partnership between South Africa and the United States.  In his remarks, the ambassador went on to outline a series of accusations against the African National Congress. He observed that its senior leadership had published “outrageous” and “patently false” statements in the Resolution on International Relations that were openly “hostile” to the national security interests of the US government.  Moreover, he maintained that the African National Congress Headquarters, Luthuli House, had been unresponsive to his repeated attempts to open dialogue on these matters. To rub salt in the wound, Ambassador Reuben confirmed the existence of intelligence that showed that weapons and ammunition were loaded onto the Russian vessel at Naval Base Simon’s Town.  In his words, the US government was “confident that weapons were loaded into that vessel, and I would bet my life on the accuracy of that assertion.” He characterized such behavior by a strategic partner as “fundamentally unacceptable.”  The South African government was quick to respond to the allegations regarding the arms transfer at Naval Base Simon’s Town. The spokesperson to the President, Vincent Magwenya, claimed that the ambassador had undermined “the spirit of cooperation and partnership” that existed between the two countries in resolving the matter.  He noted that the South African government had launched “an independent inquiry” into the accusations made by the US government, and the two countries had agreed to allow that investigation “to run its course,” with the United States Intelligence Community providing supporting evidence.  For its part, the South African Department of Defense issued a statement in support of the independent investigation as it would provide “an opportunity to ventilate its side of the story with concrete evidence,” and thereby “deal with allegations surrounding the purpose of such a visit in front of a competent officer of the law instead of hearsay or speculation.”  Separately, the South African government issued a démarche to the ambassador through diplomatic channels. This led to the arrangement of a meeting between Ambassador Reuben and Foreign Minister Pandor. Following that meeting, the South African government reaffirmed that the National Conventional Arms Control Committee had never approved of a “sale of arms to Russia related to the period and incident in question.”  Noting that the independent inquiry would provide a “platform to establish facts and role players in the incident in question,” the South African government promised that anyone “found to have broken the law will face consequences.”  Moving forward, the South African government claimed that an agreement had been reached to “use established diplomatic channels to raise whatever issue may arise in the management of the bilateral relations between the two countries.”  For his part, Ambassador Reuben noted that the meeting had provided a platform to “correct any mis-impressions left by [his] public remarks.” Perhaps not surprisingly, he never provided clarification on what, if any, mis-impressions had arisen.  Acrimonious aftermath  This breakdown in bilateral relations brought about a wide array of secondary effects. One of the first dominos to fall was the South African economy.  Almost immediately, South African bond yields skyrocketed due to investor concerns quoted in Bloomberg that “a diplomatic row” between Pretoria and Washington could put “preferential trade access … worth billions of dollars to South Africa at risk.” In parallel, the South African rand fell “to the weakest level on record against the dollar.”  This was after the rand had recently fallen to a three-year low due to increasing fears “of scheduled blackouts known as loadshedding worsening during winter.” Investors were spooked. And, they seemed to have good reasons for it. The main opposition party pointed out that “close to 77% of foreign direct investment stock” of South Africa has come from the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States in recent years.  Domestic politics was another arm to cascade. In South Africa, Clement Manyathela cautioned his listeners that the South African government “has been cagey about this Russian vessel for so long – since its arrival and dawn departure. There has been no official explanation from the Department of Defense. No explanation from the South African National Defense Force. No explanation from the Navy either.  “This is despite a number of calls from politicians. Repeated media requests for information. So whatever information the government gives you now, take it with a pinch of salt. They were never interested in transparency from the word go. So anything is possible.”  With such doubts being expressed by the media a year out from a national election, it is not surprising that national politicians tried to capitalize on the controversy for political gain.  The strongest recriminations have been leveled by the Democratic Alliance. That party not only suggested that “President Ramaphosa and his government have already lied to South Africa and the world as to our country’s involvement in this devastating conflict.”  They said that it “signals” that South Africa has, under the leadership of the African National Congress, “regressed into a nation that has abandoned the principles of freedom, fairness, and equality.”  As the Shadow Minister for International Relations and Cooperation volleyed, the South African government is now “complicit in a war of aggression that … risks undermining both our domestic priorities and international peace and security.” ActionSA leadership expressed similar beliefs that the South African government has “never had a non-aligned approach to the Ukraine-Russian war.”  Rather than “supporting Russia during the ongoing war,” its politicians demanded that the South African government “come clean about … support for a dictatorial regime which is alleged to be actively funding” the African National Congress.  Russian President Putin and South African President Ramaphosa share a private word. Image: Facebook  The Economic Freedom Fighters have waged a radically different attack. Its leader, Julius Malema, argued that “American concerns are misplaced.” He claimed that the South African government “has got no capacity to empower Russians with weapons against their own handlers.”  Using inflammatory language, he went even further. He alleged that the US government “is just becoming a crybaby trying to find a way into punishing South Africa because of our position on the Russia-Ukraine war.”  The National Freedom Party charted a similar tack. Its leadership condemned the decision by the South African government “to establish a commission of inquiry into the alleged supply of weapons to Russia.”  In their words, the United States government has no “moral authority to make any demands or claims against the South African Government given the fact that it is the USA and its allies that are supplying arms and ammunition to the Ukrainians in this proxy war with Russia.”  In the United States, the harshest criticisms have been voiced by a Member of Congress from the Republican Party. After the news of the incident broke, the Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Jim Risch, publicly rebuked the South African government for its “anti-American screeds” and maltreatment of an American ambassador. As for the démarche, he added that such behavior “doesn’t reflect friendship or a neutral partner.”  Afterward, Ranking Member Risch extended a jab across the domestic political aisle when he publicly criticized the US government for failing to stand behind an American ambassador who “spoke honestly about an issue of grave concern to US national security.”  These words will resonate with other Members of Congress who have previously called on the US government to keep Congress better apprised of the strategic partnership by providing regular and comprehensive briefings on subjects relating to South Africa.

""Your TA is useless. You don't understand the fundamentals because you only look to the past. Gold bulls are forward-thinking. The times they are a changing...""  ""The problem is that TA is like driving a car by only looking in the rear-view mirror....There is no foresight involved; it's all based on past performance. The future of the fundamentals is what you fail to grasp.""  ""There is no way you can understand what is going on in gold by doing technical analysis. Gold is driven by fundamentals.""  ""Technical analyses is all well and good, but you cannot apply it to the PM sector which has been artificially manipulated and suppressed for years.""  Yet, as we now know, gold struck a top within $6 of the top for which I was calling.  What many may have seen as either ignorance or hubris, I even provided my downside target even before gold topped, wherein I explained my expectation for gold to drop back down to the $1,000 region.  ""Based upon the Elliott Wave Principle, I would expect a very large pullback. In fact, the target for such a pullback will probably be a minimum low of $1,400, it could fall as low as $1000, or even as low as $700. It will depend upon how the decline takes form. But those are very viable targets for gold on the downside.""  The comments regarding my views were basically the same as above, so, I will just note one of the more ""reasonable"" comments:  ""There is no way to rationalize $700 gold with 50% debasement of currency expected over the next five years as US debt grows to $21 trillion from $14. It makes no sense to my feeble mind. I vote for $3000 vs. $1900 today. That makes sense to my mind.""  As you can see, it was quite clear at the time that the ""fundamentals"" were keeping most metals bulls looking to the long side. And, amazingly, those same fundamentals kept the metals bulls looking to the long side of the market during the entire decline.  But what was truly amazing was that as gold was approaching its long-term low struck at the end of 2015, almost the entire market turned bearish and was again ""certain"" that it would continue in its downside trajectory (just as strongly as they were certain we would eclipse $2,000 in 2011), with most now turning from bullish to predicting a drop below $1,000.  Well, just like everyone was uber-bullish at the highs when we expected a major top, we turned bullish when everyone turned uber-bearish. On Dec. 30, 2015, I urged investors to be moving back into the metals complex as we were looking for a long-term bottom to be struck imminently due to the significant bearishness evident in the market:  ""As we move into 2016, I believe there is a greater than 80% probability that we finally see a long-term bottom formed in the metals and miners and the long-term bull market resumes. Those that followed our advice in 2011 and moved out of this market for the correction we expected, are now moving back into this market as we approach the long-term bottom. In 2011, before gold even topped, we set our ideal target for this correction in the $700-$1,000 region in gold. We are now reaching our ideal target region, and the pattern we have developed over the last four years is just about complete. [...] For those interested in my advice, I would highly suggest you start moving back into this market with your long-term money.""  In fact, back in September 2015, when the metals mining companies were absolutely hated by the investor community, I rolled out a service on ElliottWaveTrader specifically to focus on the mining industry. We began urging our clients to buy mining stocks during the last quarter of 2015. In fact, I bought stocks such as Newmont Mining (NEM) in the $15-17 region at the time. NEM was my largest holding in the complex since that time.  Now, fast forward to 2022, and gold had been stuck in a correction since a local top was struck back in August of 2020. Yet, there were pockets within the market that still rallied into 2022.  An example of such outperformance in 2022 included NEM, which went on to strike higher highs in April of 2022. Yet, when NEM struck the 84-85 region, I outlined to the members of Elliottwavetrader that, for the first time since I bought NEM in 2015, I was selling almost my entire holdings in the company. You see, I set a target of 82-89 when NEM was hovering in the 28 region. And, when we moved into my target region, I stuck with my plan and sold my largest holding in the complex. Since that time, NEM dropped 57% off its highs.  So, back in January, I provided you with my latest assessment of the gold market, with an expectation for gold to rally to the $2,428 region in this current move off the early November low. I also noted that we can certainly even blow through that, depending upon the extensions we see in the upcoming rally, but that target was a solid one for now. Clearly, I will re-assess the target once the next bullish phase begins in earnest.  And, then in April, I outlined my expectation for the metals market to begin its next rally to the $2,200+ region. My expectation was that a break-out through $2,075 would trigger that next bigger move. Yet, while the market spiked to $2,085 in early May, I warned the members of Elliottwavetrader that the structure of that move did not look like it was starting that rally to $2,200 just yet, and I expected more of a pullback. So, while the market did spike through $2,075, it clearly was not able to sustain that rally, as we expected, and it immediately spiked back down below.  At this time, I am still expecting a fast and strong rally to $2,200+ in the coming months. A breakout over $2,085 will likely now be the trigger.  Silver is providing us with a relatively low-risk buying opportunity, as it is set up to see a very strong upside follow-through when this pullback completes.  To keep it very simple, we have been outlining to the members of Elliottwavetrader our expectation for the pullback we are now seeing in silver, and it is now striking our general target region for this expected pullback. As long as silver holds over $22.50, I am expecting this pullback to complete over the coming week or two and set us up for a strong rally which should be pointing us north of 27 rather quickly.

Lynn Fire Chief Daniel Sullivan, Department of Conservation & Recreation Chief Fire Warden David Celino, and State Fire Marshal Peter Ostroskey said that about 400 acres of land had burned as a result of suspicious fires set over a period of several days.  “Any fire can present a hazard, but we saw rapid fire growth threatening numerous homes in our community as a result of these fires,” said Chief Sullivan. “Firefighters from Lynn and our mutual aid partners worked extraordinarily hard to bring them under control, and we’re extremely fortunate that we had no serious injuries or property damage.”  “Fires like these put people, property, and wildlife at risk,” said Chief Fire Warden Celino. “We’re experiencing Red Flag conditions across Massachusetts right now, with high winds, low humidity, and very dry fuel. Outdoor fires will burn rapidly, spread quickly, and produce dangerous fire behavior under these conditions. That puts an enormous strain on firefighters, their departments, and the communities they serve.”  Based on ongoing efforts by fire investigators from the Lynn Fire Department and the State Police Fire & Explosion Investigation Unit assigned to the State Fire Marshal’s office, officials believe that eight separate fires were intentionally set on May 12, May 13, and May 17. They are asking anyone with information on these incidents to share it with investigators.  Anyone who made observations in the area of the Lynn Woods Reservation on these dates or has other information on the fires can contact the State Police Fire & Explosion Investigation Unit at 978-567-3310 or the Arson Watch Reward Program at 1-800-682-9225. The Arson Watch Reward Program is overseen by the Massachusetts Property Insurance Underwriters Association and offers rewards of up to $5,000. Tipsters may remain anonymous if they wish.  “About 40% of Massachusetts home are in or near wildland areas,” said State Fire Marshal Ostroskey. “Setting a fire in this environment is a particularly dangerous act, especially under the current weather conditions. If you have any information that can help investigators, please share it today.”  ###"

According to the National Transportation Safety Board's preliminary report, it was a natural gas-fueled explosion and fire.  Council President Ryan Lineaweaver said the local disaster emergency declaration will continue to be extended until further notice, until everything is safe and sound.  ""Essentially, it allows us to continue to receive funding from outside sources,"" Lineaweaver said. ""It allows us to receive help from sources that we may not be able to if we don't have the emergency declaration extended.""  Lineaweaver said this is the third time the local disaster emergency declaration has been extended. It will run through the council meeting on June 20. Lineaweaver said it is mainly state assistance.  ""So, for instance, when we drew it up around midnight the day after Palmer happened,"" he explained, ""we ended up drawing it up, we sent it in to the county, and the next day we had access to [Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency].""  South Second Avenue remains blocked off where the explosion happened. Lineaweaver said it will be closed until further notice. He tells 69 News there will be some work going on at some of the buildings in the area.  ""They're currently working with Palmer for Building 1, to go in and retrieve items,"" Lineaweaver said.  He also said a waterproofing was put up on the north-facing wall that was removed.  ""There's a handful of things happening down there, slow and steady, but it's eventually turned back to both the companies and the business owners that own the buildings, as well as dealing with their insurance companies as well,"" Lineaweaver said.  The NTSB has yet to release a final report. According to the agency's initial report, the ongoing investigation will focus on a review of collected evidence, identifying the source of the explosion and related industry practices and federal regulations."

The Douglas bats put that idea on ice in the second inning, when they brought 14 batters to the plate, hit three home runs, and scored nine runs. The Eagles then put it in cruise control, and sailed to a 10-1 win, and their third straight state final four appearance.  “I can’t say enough about our offensive approaches tonight,” said Douglas Manager Todd Fitz-Gerald. “We were locked in and stuck to the plan.”  The plan, it turns out, was similar to their regional semifinal game against Taravella, when the Eagles put up 10 runs in the first two innings. Douglas has now outscored their five playoff opponents by a combined 57-9.  Having a nine run lead in the second inning is insurmountable no matter when it happens. But when facing the most dominant pitcher of the past three seasons, Douglas’ ace Christian Rodriguez, the task becomes even more daunting.  Rodriguez threw six innings, limiting the Explorers hitters to just three hits and one run. He struck out four on the evening, before he gave way to Gavin Gargiulo, who closed out the regional final win with two strikeouts in the seventh.  The game served as the last one ever at home for Rodriguez, who has compiled a 12-0 record in 2023. Overall, Rodriguez is 30-1 in his high school career, with a 1.30 career ERA, to go along with 304 strikeouts in 183.2 innings.  “I couldn’t be happier for C-Rod, going out like he did in his final home game,” said Fitz-Gerald. “He has been such a special person in my life since he was seven years old. I’m like his second dad, and I love him immensely.”  With Rodriguez locking it down on the mound, the Eagles offensive explosion in the second came courtesy of some familiar names. Matt Ossenfort hit a double, and a home run in the inning. The homer was the third in two games for the senior first baseman. Ossenfort’s blast was followed by a Nico Benestad home run. Later in the inning, Alex Rodriguez connected for the third homer of the inning.  With the win, Douglas moves on to the 7A semifinals. Awaiting them will be Spruce Creek, with manager Matt Cleveland, a former longtime Broward County manager. The other semifinal will feature Plant, out of Tampa, and Park Vista, a team Douglas beat 8-2 earlier this season.  Douglas will be chasing history, with no public school team in Broward County history ever having an undefeated season. The Eagles sit at 27-0.  “I’m so happy for the boys and the coaches,” said Fitz-Gerald. “I want this for them, and couldn’t be more excited for this opportunity.”  To exemplify just how good Douglas has been this season, consider that they have only trailed for a total of five innings the entire season, and all five innings, they only trailed 1-0.  Furthermore, the Eagles have faced a whopping 16 teams that are ranked in the Top 10 of their sites HSBN Power Rankings. The total score combined in those 16 wins is 120-21. Two of those teams are defending state champions, and are heading back to states this year (Doral, North Broward Prep). To see just how unprecedented that is, here is a breakdown of the ranked teams they have beat, with the scores.

Infostealers pilfer login credentials, financial details, and personal data from infected computers and networks, and a report published Tuesday by the vendor’s Counter Threat Unit claims the tools are becoming more sophisticated and harder to detect, posing a growing challenge for defenders of corporate networks.  Threat groups package and sell the exfiltrated data as logs which can be used to break into enterprise networks via remote access services, like virtual private networks (VPNs) and Microsoft Office Web Access (OWA).  Secureworks research found that since June 2021, the number of logs for sale on Russian Market – the largest dark web market for infostealer logs, - was up 670%. It grew by 150% from June 2022, when there were 2 million logs for sale on a single day, to 5 million in late February 2023.  “Coordinated global action by law enforcement is having some impact, but cybercriminals are adept at reshaping their routes to market,” said Don Smith, vice president for threat research at SecureWorks.  Despite multiple arrests and the takedown of 11 domains associated with Genesis Market last month, the Tor site remained operational with logs still available for sale. Activity had slowed, however, and criminals had been observed on underground forums discussing their concerns about using the market.  Telegram has been a beneficiary of this, with more buying and selling of logs for popular stealers such as RedLine, Anubis, SpiderMan and Oski Stealer shifting to dedicated Telegram channels, Secureworks found.  The malware is also becoming cheaper and easier for relatively inexperienced cybercriminals to use, and the popularity of working from home and bring your own device (BYOD) policies have led to a surge in opportunities for corporate assets to be infected by personal devices. Many underground forums sell the tool as part of a monthly subscription package for prices that range between $50 and $1,000 per month.  “Infostealers are a natural choice for cybercriminals who are looking to rapidly gain access to businesses and then monetize that access,” said Smith. “They are readily available for purchase, and within as little as 60 seconds generate an immediate result in the form of stolen credentials and other sensitive information.”  Smith said the innovative ways criminals were finding to trick users into installing the malware, such as via fake messaging apps and cloned websites, “has really changed the game.”  Secureworks said the growing popularity of malware-as-a-service within the criminal underworld had sparked innovation among developers to improve their products and appeal to a wider range of customers.  For example, Russian Market started offering users the option to pre-order stolen credentials for a specific organization, business, or application. While there were no guarantees pre-orders would be fulfilled, buyers who deposited $1,000 into the site’s escrow system could request credentials based on a specified domain name.  The SecureWorks report claims the use of infostealers is now so widespread, an entire secondary market has popped up for individuals who can parse raw log data into common or usable formats for a fee.  “What we are seeing is an entire underground economy and supporting infrastructure built around infostealers, making it not only possible but also potentially lucrative for relatively low-skilled threat actors to get involved,” Smith said.  Because of their ability to discreetly and efficiently exfiltrate sensitive data from targeted systems, the tools are also popular with state-sponsored threat groups that focused on cyberespionage operations.  During the war in Ukraine, Russian threat actors had deployed the Graphiron infostealer to target Ukrainian organizations. Chinese state-sponsored threat groups had also been observed using infostealers.  Smith said there were a range of measures organizations could take to reduce the risk of data theft.  “Ensuring that you implement multi-factor authentication to minimize the damage caused by the theft of credentials, being careful about who can install third-party software and where it is downloaded from, and implementing comprehensive monitoring across host, network and cloud are all key aspects of a successful defense against the threat of infostealers.”"

Dallas' third-round pick in the 2018 NFL Draft burst onto the scene with career-highs in receptions (66), receiving yards (1,107) and receiving touchdowns (six) at 23 years old in 2019. Then a gruesome, season-ending ankle injury to quarterback Dak Prescott hampered his development in 2020, and a season-ending torn ACL in Week 17 of the 2021 season against the Arizona Cardinals set him back much further.  The effects from coming back from the severe knee injury showed externally on the field -- Gallup totaled a career-low 424 receiving yards last season -- but he was also dealing with the mental hurdle of trusting his movements, which was nearly as big of an issue.  ""I was thinking too much [last season],"" Gallup said Wednesday, via The Athletic. ""My knee was feeling sore and it was just different. I never really had it like that last year.""  A little more than 16 months removed from suffering the injury, Gallup is in a completely different place and confident he can return to form. Dallas is banking on it considering it signed him to a five-year, $57.5 million deal in the 2022 offseason, shortly after the injury.  ""It's different,"" Gallup said when asked about his knee now. ""I feel springy again.""  Michael Gallup DAL • WR • #13 TAR 74 REC 39 REC YDs 424 REC TD 4 FL 0 View Profile  The 2023 season will also be different for Gallup because he will be returning to the role he thrived in, as the team's third receiver, when he and quarterback Dak Prescott were last both healthy for an entire season and four-time Pro Bowl wideout Amari Cooper was on the roster. Once again, Dallas has two high-caliber pass-catchers in front of him in 2022 second-team All-Pro CeeDee Lamb and offseason trade acquisition Brandin Cooks.  The Silver and Blue acquired the soon-to-be 30-year-old in March from the Houston Texans in exchange for a 2023 fifth-round pick and a 2024 sixth-round pick. The Cowboys then promptly signed him to a two-year, $20 million extension that locks him in with the team through the 2024 season.  Getting Cooks was a big deal. Since 2014 when he entered the league, he's one of seven players with more than 8,500 receiving yards (8,616) and 45 receiving touchdowns (49). Alongside Cooks in that exclusive club is Davante Adams, Mike Evans, DeAndre Hopkins, Travis Kelce, Stefon Diggs and Antonio Brown.  Cooks' six career seasons of at least 1,000 receiving yards are tied for the third-most in the NFL since 2014, trailing only Evans (nine) and Kelce (seven). He has achieved the feat with each of his four previous teams: the New Orleans Saints (2015-16), New England Patriots (2017), Los Angeles Rams (2018) and Texans (2020-21). Doing so in 2021 with Houston is especially noteworthy given he was catching passes from 32-year-old Tyrod Taylor and rookie Davis Mills. Gallup could hardly contain his excitement when talking about being able to start alongside him.  ""Oh man, Brandin Cooks, I'm talking about a 10-year vet that has [six] seasons over 1,000 yards,"" Gallup said. ""He's just bringing knowledge to the whole group, and we love him in [the wide receivers room]. I ain't going to lie to you. He has been in there every day, working, just trying to win. That's all he wants to do is just win, and he wants to do it as a group. He's a great addition.""  Brandin Cooks DAL • WR • #3 TAR 93 REC 57 REC YDs 699 REC TD 3 FL 0 View Profile  The most significant pearls of wisdom Cooks has imparted on Dallas' young pass-catchers have been about the keys to extending their careers: taking care of their bodies.  ""Getting your body right. That's all he keeps preaching. He talks to everybody, 'When you are done with this, you're done with that, make sure you stretch. Make sure you do what you're supposed to do so you can stay in the league as long as you possibly can.' That's one of the biggest things right now. Football, that's going to be there. We got in the league for a reason, but he's over here talking about how you stay in the league. That's the knowledge he's bringing.""  Alongside Lamb and Cooks, Gallup and his healthy knees are finally ready to turn the clock back to 2019."

The address comes back to INEOS Oligomers.  All personnel accounted for after fire erupts at building in La Porte, OEM says  LA PORTE, Texas (KTRK) -- Firefighters were called to a fire early Wednesday morning in La Porte.  At 7:10 a.m., the roof of the building, located in the 1200 block of Miller Cut Off Road, was still burning, and clouds of smoke were visible north of SH-225. Thirty minutes later, the flames were out.  SkyEye was over the scene, where crews were working on the ground.  According to La Porte's Office of Emergency Management, the fire was contained to an office space.  All personal are accounted for, officials said, adding that drivers should expect heavy traffic and delays in the area.  A banner on the side of the building read INEOS Oligomers.  INEOS released a statement to ABC13 about the incident, explaining that the fire happened on the property but outside the main plant. No chemicals or hazardous materials were inside the modular office space, the company said.  ""This was a structure fire outside the plant gates (on property but outside main plant itself). The modular office space was being prepared for removal from the facility and was NOT in use at the time. It did not contain any chemical or hazardous materials. Nobody inside and no injuries from the fire. No word on what may have sparked the fire. It is under control as firefighters continue to put water on it.""

The fire comes as there have been at least two other recent incidents at plant facilities in our area.  Roughly two weeks ago, an explosion occurred at the Shell Deer Park facility at 5900 SH-225. In that incident, nine contractors were evaluated, and several residents in Deer Park told ABC13 they plan to file lawsuits.  That explosion sent thick, black smoke into the air at the time and reignited one day after the initial blast.

But there has been a shift across the past year as focus turned from Mumbai, which had suffered a string of misses until Shah Rukh Khan’s Pathaan took off on a tear early this year, toward Southern India.  The Indian film industry is one of the world’s most prolific, but it somehow feels like a switch has been flipped with interest from non-diaspora audiences. In part, that’s down to S.S. Rajamouli and his Telugu-language pic RRR, which became a phenomenon unto its own with worldwide box office appeal and awards recognition from myriad bodies including the Academy, which made “Naatu Naatu” the first song from an Indian movie to win an Oscar.  Rajamouli already had made waves globally with his two-part Baahubali franchise. But RRR put Telugu titles into the mainstream outside India, arguably fueling growth in so-called pan-India movies. RRR’s N.T. Rama Rao Jr. (NTR) recently was set to star with Hrithik Roshan in War 2, which, along with Pathaan, forms part of Yash Raj Films’ Spy Universe. The crossover could give War 2 wider audience appeal.  RELATED: Cannes Film Festival Photo Gallery Of Premieres & Parties  India, a multilingual and multi-ethnic country, consists of several different industries corresponding to different states, such as Bollywood (Hindi cinema), Tollywood (Telugu cinema) and Kollywood (Tamil cinema).  (L-R) Scarlett Mellish Wilson, Prabhas, Nora Fatehi and Sneha Upadhyay in ‘Baahubali: The Beginning’ Birch Tree Entertainment/Everett Collection  Given that Hindi is understood in almost three-quarters of India, Bollywood historically was the dominant player. As box office analyst Jatinder Singh says, “Due to the language barrier, the industries like Tollywood and Kollywood remained regional players, catering only to their state primarily.” That was until South Indian films began getting dubbed into Hindi — mostly for TV but also coinciding with the emergence of multiplexes in India, especially in the north. The multiplexes and their higher ticket prices, Singh says, “started making cinemagoing an elitist activity, and Bollywood started to cater to these multiplex audiences, cutting down on larger-than-life commercial masala films.” In turn, South Indian films dubbed into Hindi began to dominate television, too, as they provided what Bollywood was not delivering.  RELATED: Cannes Film Festival Full Coverage  Then, in a watershed moment in 2015, a Hindi version of Rajamouli’s Baahubali: The Beginning was released theatrically and became a huge breakout success. In 2017, the sequel followed suit. As the audience expanded for South Indian films, so did budgets and production values.  Says Sri Harsha Chundru, co-founder of Walls & Trends, which marketed RRR and regularly works with major titles: “Telugu cinema has proved that language does not matter. A good and emotional story can transcend linguistic and socio-cultural barriers. Also, we are one of the few industries that managed to strike a balance between commercial or colloquially speaking ‘mass’ elements and a larger-than-life message or any other inspiring and message-oriented takeaways. I think RRR and other unapologetic entertainers, so to speak, have paved the way for mainstream commercial cinema and inspired other filmmakers to dream big.”  He calls Telugu cinema “a melting pot of culture,” suggesting that audiences can expect “many more multi-starrer films featuring actors from different industries across India, if not the world.” Whatever comes next, it will be, “bigger, better and bolder.”  RELATED: Cannes Palme d’Or Winners Through The Years: Photo Gallery  But Chundru also predicts: “While the quality of VFX and graphics are likely to exponentially improve, there will be a rise in small-budget films as well. Large-scale Telugu films put Telugu cinema as a whole in the limelight, so audiences across the world would be eager to explore more of Telugu cinema in all its shapes and forms.”  Actress Pooja Hegde, who has appeared in Telugu, Tamil and Hindi films, says that while the perception from outside of India is that Telugu cinema has only just emerged in the past year, this is not the case. It has been “years of audience building, hard work, and love. And when the dubbed versions were released simultaneously with the original language version in the theaters, the payoff has been huge. It is encouraging that the West is beginning to understand that India is a very culturally diverse country and that there is more to it than just Hindi films. There is a lot of talent in India and film industries from across the states are producing exceptional films, be it through its storytelling or technical skills.”  Allu Arjun in ‘Pushpa: The Rise Part 01’ Classics Entertainment/Everett Collection  Says Singh, “2022 felt like it was the year when the result of this was on full display as multiple South Indian Hindidubbed films found success.” Those also include Pushpa: The Rise — Part 01, Kantara, Karthikeya 2, Vikram and Ponniyin Selvan: Part I.  Anticipation ahead is high for upcoming Tollywood titles including Ram Charan’s Game Changer, NTR’s next untitled pic and Hombale Films’ Telugu-language action thriller Salaar, starring Prabhas, who also features in Yash Raj’s Project K with Deepika Padukone and Amitabh Bachchan for release in early 2024. Hombale, which released Prashanth Neel’s Yash-starring Kannada-language smash KGF: Chapter 2, also is working on Kannada-language Kantara 2, directed by and starring Rishab Shetty. It’s part of an ambitious slate across four South Indian languages from the studio, which recently pledged to invest $370 million in films and series over the next five years.  RELATED: India Recorded Second-Biggest Box Office Year Ever In 2022 With $1.28B, But Admissions Still Down On Pre-Pandemic Levels  “There is a great exchange of culture that is happening right now,” RRR star Charan says. “The boundaries are becoming seamless and blurred, and I think it’s important that my nation calls themselves the Indian film industry rather than sectioning ourselves into different industries. … I’m happy that I’m in an era where this change is happening. It’s good to be part of the global film industry now.”  Dylan Marchetti of Variance Films, who, alongside Potentate Films, Sarigama Cinemas and Raftar Creations, released RRR in the U.S. and led the Academy push, said recently that RRR could be a “gateway drug,” adding: “There are a lot of people — programmers, bookers, industry people — who were only peripherally aware of Telegu/South Indian cinema. There will be more films like this that can cross over.”  Read the digital edition of Deadline’s Disruptors/Cannes magazine here  Today he remains bullish. “There’s always going to be an audience of film lovers that, if it’s good, they’ll find it. I’m interested in developing the secondary Western audience that needs to be marketed to. That audience, as it grows, will have offshoots leaning more toward action or the fantastical. You need to have a steady supply and marketing in conjunction with the global release. I think there’s a hunger now.”  Variance is looking for the next title to bring to U.S. cinemas. “We are doing our part to put the best of the best in front of the audience,” Marchetti says. “There is a curiosity — once you’ve seen something you’ve never seen before, you want to see more. My hope is that it continues to advance people’s minds.” He points to examples like 2000’s Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, which spurred folks to dig more into martial arts movies, or the success of Parasite, which turned them on to Korean cinema.  Rajamouli has said previously that the success of RRR and the rise of Telugu cinema is “really important” to him. “Because now I can expand even more,” he explained. “More and more films are going to come and cross these language barriers and tap into people across larger areas. Hopefully, we grow beyond, not just in the country, but into other countries, cultures and languages as well.”"

Atypical myopathy – a condition that weakens a horse’s muscles – can occur when toxin hypoglycin A, found in sycamore seeds, is ingested. It is thought the hot summer of 2022 had contributed to greater-than-normal production of the seeds, and a rise in cases of the condition.  The British Equine Veterinary Association (BEVA) said the huge number of toxic seeds are now sprouting in numerous places, including pastures and hay fields, “causing an alarming second rise in cases of atypical myopathy”.  Vet Phil Cramp lost his 13-year-old “gentle giant” Dermot to the condition last month.  “We’d been on a fun ride; he had a great time and was happy,” Mr Cramp told H&H. “But when we got home, he was quivering, he wasn’t right. We thought he’d tied up and treated him but he got rapidly worse.”  Mr Cramp took Dermot to his practice, where blood tests confirmed atypical myopathy and despite the vets’ best efforts, he had to be put down. Mr Cramp said the toxin is water-soluble, so the standing water from this wet spring has exacerbated the situation to a “perfect storm”. He added that the other horses kept in the same field were tested and had levels of the toxin but did not become ill.  “That tells us that some are susceptible and some aren’t,” he said. “They have to convert the toxin and none of them had done that.”  Mr Cramp advises spraying fields, and blood-testing horses who may have ingested seeds or seedlings.  “If the horse has the toxin, it needs to come out of the field, and be rested,” he said. “Exercise brings out the disease as the toxin inhibits ATP, the cells’ fuel, so the muscles run out of energy. There are things you can do to reduce the impact but rest is very important.”  Horse owner Amelia Shaw has started a petition calling for landowners to have an automatic right to fell sycamore trees on their land even if restrictions related to conservation areas or tree protection orders (TPO) apply.  Sign the petition  She told H&H she did get permission to fell a sycamore that was subject to a TPO on her land in 2016, but “it was a bit of a nightmare”.  “The whole process was difficult,” she said. “We were refused by the council but won on appeal. I was still at university so had time to do it but the condition is so prevalent this year and I’ve heard lots of people saying they want to fell trees but they’re protected. So I wanted to raise awareness, and also see if I could get support. It’s absolutely awful this year, we’ll be lucky if there are any horses left.”  BEVA is urging farmers cutting fields for hay to identify those at risk; not just those with sycamores nearby as the seeds can travel hundreds of metres, and avoid selling this hay to horse owners.  President David Rendle said: “By raising awareness of the risks of contaminated hay being fed to horses BEVA is hoping farmers will be able to identify any sycamore saplings within the crop while the grass length enables them to be seen. Sheep and cattle can also be affected by the toxin at very high levels but ruminants are more resistant to the toxin than horses. We are urging farmers to check their fields now and to discuss the risks from sycamores with their local equine veterinary practice if they need any further advice.”  You might also be interested in:  Horse & Hound magazine, out every Thursday, is packed with all the latest news and reports, as well as interviews, specials, nostalgia, vet and training advice.

One NFL analyst believes so.  ""Over the next season and over the next couple of years, this could be one of the most explosive offenses in the NFL and I think it has unlimited upside,"" Louis Riddick said during a recent appearance on ESPN's ""NFL Live.""  It's only been three years since the Packers had the No. 1-ranked scoring offense in the league and, with Aaron Rodgers at quarterback, they had a top-10 offense in 10 of the last 15 seasons.  Three years later, nearly everything has changed.  Love will be the quarterback. The wide receiver room has completely turned over with all first and second-year players led by Christian Watson and Romeo Doubs teaming with rookies Jayden Reed and Dontayvion Wicks. And the tight end position will be anchored by rookies Luke Musgrave and Tucker Kraft.  ""You have to take it slow and be willing to live with the bumps in the road,"" said Riddick, a former NFL player, scout and member of two front offices. ""You have to give them some time.""  What is a successful season for Jordan Love and the Packers in 2023?  Riddick's fellow panelist, Keyshawn Johnson, a former NFL wide receiver, gave a simple response when asked how success will be defined for Love in Year 1 as the starter.  ""Well, don't screw it up,"" Johnson said bluntly.  Johnson added that if Love can get the Packers to the eight-win mark — the Packers' total last season — or a little better, and show Packers management that he has improved, it'll be a successful season. Of note, the Packers' offense in 2022 with Rodgers playing every game dropped out of the top 10 in scoring, ranking 14th and their 21.8 points average was 10 points fewer than their league-high 2020 season. And in Rodgers' first season as the starter in 2008 the Packers finished 6-10 a year after going 13-3.  ""Show us that you've evolved since sitting on the bench,"" Johnson said. ""Show us what the Green Bay Packers saw in practice and what little bit of game play that you've had, that you've learned from it, that you've gotten better. I think he'll be successful. I understand he can't be Aaron Rodgers off the bat.""  Riddick explained the Packers should lean on what he called one of the best offensive lines and running back tandems in the NFL. Even so, managing expectations will be critical for Matt LaFleur and his coaching staff with so much inexperience across the offense.  Christian Watson, who is entering his second season, will lead a young Green Bay Packers wide receiving room in 2023.  Do the Packers need to sign a veteran wide receiver?  So, given the lack of NFL experience of the receivers, should the Packers add a veteran wideout? Johnson doesn't view that as a necessity.  ""I think you can expect them to be the core,"" he said. ""As long as you have a veteran wide receiver coach and a veteran offensive playcaller, they'll be fine.""  Jason Vrable enters his fifth season with the Packers and second as the wide receivers/passing game coordinator. He served as the wide receivers coach for two years before that and was an offensive assistant for one season. He came to the Packers with six years of NFL coaching experience.  Adam Stenavich is in his second year as offensive coordinator but LaFleur is the playcaller.  ""A lot of people look at it the wrong way,"" Johnson said of needing veterans. ""I understand it was Aaron Rodgers and there were high hopes in Green Bay. But you have to give them the opportunity and chance.""

(WSMV) - Looking at the photos of her daughter’s 2016 Kia Soul burned beyond recognition, Kim Kaiser wipes away tears.  “They’re hard to look at,” Kaiser said. “Just how close my kids were to getting hurt.”  Kaiser’s oldest daughter was behind the wheel on Briley Parkway on March 27, her youngest in the passenger seat, when something unexpected happened. “The gas, as she went to press on it, stopped accelerating,” Kaiser said.  Moments later, Kaiser’s daughter pulled over, and she and her sister noticed smoke coming out of the vents.  “It was just minutes of getting out of the car that it was engulfed in flames,” Kaiser said.  Kim Kaiser's two teenager daughters were in the car when the car began to cease accelerating. Moments later, it caught on fire. (Kim Kaiser)  Fire happened on Briley Parkway on March 27, 2023 (Kim Kaiser)  Dominque Willis’ experience driving his fiancé's 2015 Kia Soul before it burst into flames is strikingly similar.  Willis was also driving on Briley Parkway on Dec. 29, 2022, when he too had to pull over. “I kind of noticed the car wasn’t accelerating like it normally would,” Willis said.  As he pulled over and tried to restart the car, Willis said a woman drove in front of him and yelled for him to exit the car, as flames were underneath.  In a video he recorded moments later, Willis can be heard screaming, asking why the car was on fire. He then called his fiancé, Kanesha Horsley.  “He’s like, I don’t know, I can’t explain it. The cart is on fire,” Horsley said.  Another video, obtained by WSMV4 Investigates, captured on September 2021 on Vietnam Veterans Parkway, shows a KIA Sorento engulfed in flames. Its driver recorded as firefighters showed up to extinguish the flames.  WSMV4 Investigates has now documented five instances in which drivers were behind the wheel and their KIA vehicles caught on fire.  To further complicate the problem, in certain years, KIA Souls and Sorentos were recalled for the potential of a car fire.  But in each of the five cases documented by WSMV4 Investigates, the vin numbers on these specific cars were not identified as being part of a recall.  In fact, Horsley said she got a recall in the mail for all KIA Souls of her year and make, took it into a dealership, only to be told that her vin number indicated that it wasn’t part of the recall. “I was just thinking, I can keep driving it, it’s fine,” Horsley said.  Insurance claim data shows more fires in other vehicles  A review of insurance claim data shows a wide swath of vehicles currently not under recall still catching fire.  The data is only for claims about vehicles that caught on fire but were not involved in accidents, like the KIA vehicles documented by WSMV4 Investigates.  The data, at a cursory level, shows the models, makes and years of the vehicles with the highest rates of non-crash fires.  There are so many cases of fires in other makes and models, the KIA Soul and Sorento don’t even make the top ten.  Matt Moore, senior vice president of the Highway Loss Data Institute, said the data is presented to NHTSA for their review in determining recalls.  “It’s difficult to know if these fires were the result of a defect or something that happened over the life of the vehicle,” Moore said.  The data shows, overwhelmingly, the claims on non-crash car fires happen in older vehicles.  “Is that the reality? That an older car is more likely to catch on fire?” WSMV4 Investigates asked.  “That’s the reality. It’s not likely to catch on fire. It’s more likely to catch on fire than a new vehicle,” Moore said.  Once again, WSMV4 Investigates reached out to KIA Corporate for an explanation of why the vehicles now showing as part of the fire recall are still catching on fire, but a spokesman just asked for the vin numbers of the vehicles to investigate further.  The spokesman did write that there are many potential causes of vehicle fires, so these investigations on the vehicles are important to begin.  “When my children see them going down the road in the cars, we want to stop them and say, sell your car, get a different car,” Kaiser said.

Betelgeuse, the red giant best known for its starring role as the right shoulder of the constellation Orion, has brightened dramatically over the past few weeks. The star is about 50 percent brighter than usual, which has fueled a fresh wave of rumors that Betelgeuse might be on the brink of a supernova.  But astrophysicist Andrea Dupree says we shouldn’t worry — or get our hopes up. Instead, this latest strangeness from Betelgeuse is actually a sign that the star is getting back to normal.  “The star WILL go supernova,” Dupree tells Inverse, “but not in our lifetimes.”  “Where’s the Kaboom?”  This image tracks the Surface Mass Ejection that caused Betelgeuse’s infamous Great Dimming. NASA  At the moment, nuclear reactions deep in Betelgeuse’s core are busily smashing helium atoms together to form carbon atoms. When the star runs out of helium, a new set of reactions will start fusing carbon into oxygen.  Only after all the oxygen has become silicon, and all the silicon has become iron, will Betelgeuse finally run out of fuel to power the nuclear reactions that keep the star inflated against the tremendous force of its own gravity. At that point, it will collapse under its own gargantuan mass, triggering one of the most powerful explosions in the universe: a supernova.  Astronomers and skywatchers have been keeping a close eye on Betelgeuse since 2019, when its usual reddish glow faded dramatically. The Great Dimming, as it came to be called, continued through 2020 — and so did the supernova speculation. Dupree and her colleagues concluded that the dimming was part of the giant star’s normal restless activity.  Essentially, Betelgeuse belched out a cloud of gas and dust into space from an inner layer called the photosphere, which left a cool, dark patch on its southern hemisphere (which happens to be the hemisphere that’s facing Earth). Our own Sun does something similar, called a coronal mass ejection, fairly often; the only difference is that Betelgeuse’s ejection came from deeper inside the star.  Betelgeuse has always been prone to fluctuations; ancient historical records and oral histories say the star brightened and dimmed on a regular cycle, and that's continued through modern times. That cycle has been a fairly regular 420 days — up until the Great Dimming. Since then, Betelgeuse has been erratic at best. Betelgeuse’s recent brightening may be part of the star’s attempt to regain its equilibrium after its great stellar burp.  “The surface and interior of the star are trying to get back to normal after the substantial Surface Mass Ejection,” says Dupree. “Think of it as like your washing machine going off on ‘imbalance’ and sloshing around trying to get back to 'normal.’”  In other words, we can probably expect to see a few more rounds of sudden brightening and dimming from Betelgeuse before it settles back into more predictable behavior.  “Our theoretical calculations suggest that the 400-day period should return in a year or two, but Betelgeuse may surprise us,” Dupree says.  Apocalypse When?  But the real surprise would be if Betelgeuse actually went supernova within our lifetimes — or the lifetimes of the next several generations of humans. If Betelgeuse, or another red giant star, really is about to explode, it will give us some warning in the form of drastic changes that will make the Great Dimming look like nothing but a brief flicker. The star should darken abruptly, getting about 100 times dimmer in a matter of weeks or months, as it shrugs off its outer layers entirely.  When the big moment finally comes, Betelgeuse will abruptly transform from a very recognizable bright red star in the constellation Orion to a blaze of light about half as bright as a full Moon, visible even in the daytime. As the star is 650 light years away, future Earthlings will be able to observe the supernova from a safe distance, but close enough for astronomers to gather incredible data on the death of a giant star. It will be a once-in-several-thousand-lifetimes astronomical event.  Betelgeuse will get there eventually. Just give it 10,000 years or so."

Where it is well-harnessed, that generally implies a productive population that is the hallmark of the industrialised world. It means a lower dependent population and better standard of living. With more taxes from a large population that is productively engaged, enough revenue can be sourced to improve benefits for those in the dependent age group, thus creating a happier society.    The National Universities Commission (NUC), Small and Medium Enterprise Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN), Industrial Training Fund (ITF), Nigerian Employers Consultative Association (NECA), regulatory bodies in various professions, and the Federal Ministry of Employment, Labour and Productivity should embark on critical review of different skills or knowledge being acquired in Nigeria’s schools at all levels to make them industry- focused such that graduates would be packaged to respond to the needs of employers. Furthermore, the Central Industrial Liaison and Job Placement Unit (CILPU) in various universities in-charge of Student’s Industrial Work Experience Scheme (SIWES) should be strengthened for the effective coordination, operation and management of the nation’s future labour force.    In addition, there should be a credible census and issuance of National Identity cards to all Nigerians, to determine the actual population that will form the basis of economic plans. Collectively, developing and managing Nigerian human resources will help advance humanity’s cause and reduce the number of people that live in excruciating poverty in our country and continent-wide.

Regulators have closed their investigation into these explosions, but people who have experienced this told Channel 2 consumer investigator Justin Gray that it sounds and feels like an explosion in their vehicles.  Auto safety advocates say that really puts drivers at risk of an accident.  Kate Holder said she had to pull over after hearing what she can only describe as an explosion while driving her brand-new Jeep Wagoneer to work.  “I was going 55 miles an hour, then all of a sudden, like, literally an explosion,” Holder said.  [HAVE A STORY FOR 2 INVESTIGATES?: Submit your tip here]  Then she got out of the car.  “I just stood up on the rail. Got up and saw the big hole,” Holder said.  “Truly spontaneous?” Gray asked Holder.  “Yes, the most bizarre thing ever,” she said.  But when Channel 2 Action News checked with federal regulators, we found spontaneous breakage of panoramic sunroofs have been happening with a variety of makes and model vehicles for years.  So much so that The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration launched a 7-year investigation finding, “spontaneous sunroof glass shattering is not an uncommon occurrence: More than 4,000 complaints of such occurrences were reported by the 13 manufacturers”  MORE STORIES FROM 2 INVESTIGATES:  Gray checked the NHTSA complaint database as recently as last week.  The driver of a Ford Edge wrote, “I was driving down the road when out of nowhere my sunroof started raining glass in the inside of my car!! There was no Crack or stone that hit it nothing!!”  “That type of distraction while you’re driving, you know, you’ve got tempered glass chunks all over you and you don’t know what just happened. I think any reasonable person can see that that could pose a pretty serious distraction risk,” said Michael Brooks, executive director of The Center for Auto Safety.  But in 2021, NHTSA closed its investigation into panoramic sunroofs without ever determining what’s causing them to spontaneously explode, writing it “has not identified sufficient evidence of a safety-related defect in the subject sunroof.”  “What if the glass got into my baby’s eyes, or face, or even the car seat?” Holder asked.  She told Gray that she’s just thankful she had the cover closed on the sunroof.  “Now, I don’t want to open up the sunroof … just in case,” Holder said.  NHTSA said there have been about a dozen reported minor injuries, most from cleaning up the glass.  Gray checked with NHTSA before his report on Wednesday to see if there have been any updates. A spokesman told said there is no current investigation into the sunroofs.

The tech world has been enamored with a new generation of chatbots since OpenAI's ChatGPT went viral late last year. That's pressured companies like Amazon to showcase their own capabilities in generative AI. Amazon's biggest entry into the market thus far has been through an AI service for cloud customers.  However, Rohit Prasad, Amazon's senior vice president and head scientist for Alexa, said it's wrong to think the e-retailer has missed out in generative AI, which allows people to convert text-based queries into creative and thorough answers.  ""Alexa has been and is at the forefront of AI for a long time,"" Prasad told CNBC in an interview. ""We've been part of the cultural zeitgeist and it hasn't slowed down.""  Prasad added that contrary to ChatGPT, which remains accessible through a web browser, Alexa is an ""instantly available, personal AI"" that people can communicate with by voice.  Amazon established an early lead in voice software after it debuted its Alexa digital assistant in 2014. More than 500 million Alexa-powered devices have been sold worldwide, the company said Wednesday. The last time Amazon gave an update on that number was in 2019, when it was at 100 million.  The Alexa assistant, now plugged into everything from smart speakers to thermostats, has long depended on machine learning technology to answer their queries by fetching relevant data.  But the rise of AI-powered chatbots, which can perform sophisticated functions like writing fiction and coding software, has highlighted the limitations of digital assistants such as Alexa. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' sci-fi vision for Alexa to resemble an all-knowing computer from ""Star Trek"" hasn't exactly panned out.  Prasad said Amazon is working to make Alexa more conversational and intelligent. One way it hopes to do so is through a new version of its own large language model, called Alexa Teacher Model. Large language models power generative AI, and Alexa is already powered by Amazon's LLM.  The goal is for Alexa to be able to answer complex requests, and understand more about users.  ""This is where all the ambient context of who you are, what are you asking, where you are, comes in to make the best decision for you in that moment and on your behalf,"" Prasad said.  In his latest letter to investors, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said generative AI and LLMs are areas where the company is ""investing heavily,"" noting that the technologies stand to ""transform and improve virtually every customer experience.""  The company has posted job listings suggesting it plans to implement a ChatGPT-style product in search on its online store, Bloomberg reported. Amazon may also add more generative AI-like features to Alexa focused on entertainment and storytelling, according to Insider.

The case, which came before Letterkenny Circuit Court this week, has been adjourned until next Thursday for the defendant to provide evidence of his residence at the property and of expenses he claims to have incurred in carrying out improvements.  Mr Hugh Kelly, a 59-year-old of Castledoe, Creeslough, was one of ten people tragically killed in a gas explosion at the Applegreen complex in Creeslough on October 7, 2022.  Letterkenny Circuit Court heard how the late Mr Kelly had given a lift to a man and his young daughter, who also died in the blast, to the shop on the tragic afternoon.  Ms Linda Gallagher said she was the beneficiary of the last will and testament, dated November 30, 2006 of the late Mr Kelly, which included a house, car and out office on lands known as Bishops Island at Castledoe, Creeslough, together with the residue of his estate.  An affidavit from Ms Gallagher said that she attended the property in question on October 15, 2022 and discovered that the deceased’s nephew, Mr Josie Kelly, had ‘wrongfully or illegally entered the dwelling and changed the locks’.  Ms Gallagher, who was represented by Mr Gareth McGrory BL, instructed by solicitor Mr Frank Dorian, alleged that Mr Josie Kelly had unlawfully and wrongfully trespassed and accessed the dwelling house and had also placed padlocks on the gates and placed a donkey on the lands.  The court heard that the late Mr Hugh Kelly had resided at the property - which was described as being a ‘traditional farmhouse with extension and outbuildings’ - all of his life. The court was told that the property was registered in Mr Hugh Kelly’s name having previously been in the name of his mother, Ms Sally Kelly,.  Ms Gallagher sought an injunction to restrain the defendant, his servants or agents from trespassing, entering or making use of the lands without the express authority of the plaintiff.  Mr McGrory said his client was also seeking an injunction to have the defendant, his servants or agents to repair any damage caused following the alleged illegal trespass.  Ms Gallagher is originally from Indiana in the United States and had been in a ‘loving relationship’ with the late Mr Kelly, although they maintained separate houses.  She said she was ‘completely distraught’ on learning of the explosion and the death of Hugh Kelly and the other nine victims of the tragedy.  She described the ‘shock, pain and sorrow’ she suffered in the immediate aftermath of the explosion.  Ms Gallagher said she went to America in late October and when she returned in November she found the gates were chained and padlocked and a donkey was present on the lands.  She told the court that she has sentimental property in the house, including photographs.  In an affidavit, Mr Josie Kelly, who was represented in court by barrister Mr John McCoy BL, said his late grandfather had wished the property to stay in the Kelly family. Mr Josie Kelly said he had invested over €100,000 on improvements to the property and had organised crops of hay and silage on the farmland.  He said he had lived at the property since 1984, save for the years of his marriage until 2018, since which he had been living on the property.  Mr Kelly claimed that none of the plaintiff’s possessions are in the house and that he always had a key and access to the house.  “The property is my home,” he said.  Judge John Aylmer asked why Mr Josie Kelly had not exhibited anything in support of his evidence.  “The absence is striking,” he said, noting that he expected to see evidence that he has been living there since 2018 and of the €100,000 he said he had spent.  Mr McCoy said he would take the matter back to his client for further instruction and said there were ‘parallel proceedings’ before the High Court.  Judge Aylmer said he was giving a short opportunity for the defendant to put evidence before the court ‘that one would expect to support a contention that he has been living there since 2019’.  The matter was adjourned until Carrick-On-Shannon Circuit Court on Thursday-week, May 25, with both deponents to be present."

London Fire Brigade crews were called to the incident at the weekend on Cecil Road, Harlesden in Brent. Dell Williams (37) is one of the tenants in the two-storey terraced house and was charging his e-scooter in the kitchen of the property when the fire occurred. Luckily for him, and the other residents, they were not nearby when the incident occurred.  The CCTV footage, captured on two cameras in the hallway and in the kitchen of the property shared by the letting agent, shows how quickly the e-scooter caught alight. Dell attempts to tackle the fire with a fire blanket but is overcome by fumes and exits the property.  Security guard Dell bought the e-scooter a fortnight ago from the online marketplace Gumtree, to help him travel around London. He says he was charging the e-scooter in the communal kitchen instead of his room to avoid his dog touching it while it charged.  I'm grateful to be alive  Dell said: “I just want to thank the Lord that we managed to get out of there in one piece! I am so grateful to be alive. I spent eight hours in hospital due to inhaling smoke from the fire and when I went back to the house it was such an eye opener. I was shocked, I am shocked now. I am so grateful that no one else was hurt. I cheated death.”  Thermal runaway can lead to a ferocious fire  London Fire Brigade’s Deputy Commissioner, Dom Ellis, explains while this type of incident is frightening, sadly it is getting more common. Dom said: “As the video shows, once a battery starts to go into thermal runaway a fire develops very quickly and can block escape routes.  “Thermal runaway can lead to the destruction of the battery and a ferocious fire.  “We know prior to ignition thermal runaway can lead to the ejection of a range of gases. The white and grey coloured smoke is not harmless, and the speed at which these incidents develop shouldn’t be ignored.  “Please follow our #ChargeSafe advice and never tackle a fire: get out, stay out and dial 999.”  Don't leave them on charge unattended  Dell wants to advise others who are thinking about purchasing an e-scooter about how to keep safe, he said: “Don’t have e-scooters in the house, charge outside, don’t keep it in the house. Buy e-scooters from a shop where you have a warranty and insurance. These things happen, I wouldn’t say don’t buy one, but if you buy one store them outside so they don’t catch fire. Don’t leave them on charge unattended. Keep people and property safe!”"

Einstein's equation, E=MC^2, posits that mass and energy are the same thing but in different forms. And a tiny amount of mass represents a massive amount of energy. So much energy that the atomic weapons used against Japan and the nuclear weapons stockpiled around the world only have to convert a tiny amount of matter into energy to have devastating effects. How tiny? A butterfly's worth.  The Hiroshima bomb  The first atomic weapon launched in anger was the one dropped by the Enola Gay on Hiroshima, Japan on August 6, 1945. The bomb was massive, weighing approximately 9,700 pounds in an age when most bombs weighed less than 4,000. But Little Boy, as the bomb was called, used an inefficient ""gun-type"" design.  A very small amount of matter actually turned into energy. The weapon contained 141 pounds of uranium, about two pounds of it fissioned, and that converted about a gram of it into energy. That little uranium created a 15-kiloton explosion that killed nine out of 10 people within a half mile of the bomb, instantly ignited hundreds or thousands of fires that created a massive firestorm, and flattened buildings and broke windows.  An aerial photo of Hiroshima showing the destruction caused the atomic bomb on Aug. 6, 1945. The photo was in possession of Ralph Richard Hayes, former 20th Air Force, Army Air Corps, 421st Bombardment Squadron bombardier, who served during World War II in Japan. On Aug. 6, 1945, the B-29, Enola Gay, flew over Hiroshima and dropped the first atomic bomb. (Courtesy Photo)  The Nagasaki bomb  Just a few days later, on August 9, America dropped a second atomic bomb on Japan. The ""Fat Man"" bomb dropped by Bock's Car created a 21 kiloton explosion, 40% larger than the Hiroshima blast. It affected 43 square miles with blast, heat, and radiation, flattening even some earthquake-hardened structures and 14,000 homes.  The pit in the Fat Man bomb was much smaller, at 13.6 pounds, but made of plutonium which is more efficient. About 2.2 pounds of plutonium fissioned. That's the weight of a bocce ball. And even less matter was converted than underwent fission.  A B-29 Superfortress painted to commemorate “The Great Artiste”, a silverplate B-29 with the 509th Composite Group, sits as a static display on August 6, 2019, at the Spirit Gate at Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri. The Great Artiste participated in both the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki 74 years prior, providing weather and documentation of the bombings. The aircraft was lost in a crash landing in 1949 in Labrador, Canada. (U.S. Air Force photo by Airman 1st Class Parker J. McCauley)  Bikini Atoll  The Castle Bravo shot at Bikini Atoll in 1954 is the largest thermonuclear explosion ever conducted by the United States. The huge explosion was, in part, a mistake. It was the first test of a ""dry"" thermonuclear device, and designers drastically underestimated how much lithium would increase the efficiency of the weapon.  About a quarter of the weapon's 880 pounds of lithium-6 deuteride underwent fission or fusion. This resulted in a 15-megaton explosion 1,000 times stronger than the explosion at Hiroshima. It also created the largest nuclear contamination incident in U.S. history, exposing hundreds of Pacific islanders and U.S. service members to high levels of radiation.  The Tsar Bomba  The Soviet RDS-220, known in the U.S. as the Tsar Bomba, was the largest nuclear device ever detonated. On October 30, 1961, the Soviets detonated a version with a 50-megaton result. This damaged buildings over 100 miles away and a test witness 170 miles away reported feeling the thermal blast. It created a seismic event that completed three revolutions around the Earth. Insanely, this was the muted version of the Tsar Bomba, with a lead tamper instead of a uranium one. The uranium version is thought to have a 100-megaton yield.  According to an East Tennessee State University lesson supplement, the energy released by Tsar Bomba represented about 5 pounds of matter converting to energy. Those five pounds created a mushroom cloud that rose over 40 miles into the air, seven times higher than Mount Everest.  The continent cracker  Scientists at Livermore Laboratory once proposed an insane double-thermonuclear weapon. Gnomon would create a 1,000-megaton explosion and trigger Sundial which boasted a 10,000-megaton yield, if the scientists' predictions were right.  It's important to note two things: 1) The assembled scientists from other labs immediately laughed it down, and 2) These were the folks whose last three designs had failed.  But if their designs had worked, it would require an approximately 25-ton design, blow a hole in the atmosphere, and instantly burn an area about the size of France. But it would only need to convert about 100 pounds of matter into energy in the first stage and 1,000 pounds in the second stage to achieve the result."

This comes three-and-a-half years after its chemical plant exploded and damaged homes all over Mid-County.  The initial explosion happened on November 27, 2019 just before 1 a.m.  Now, thousands of people will be vying for their cut of the settlement and are starting to realize there's not enough money to go around.  Lawyers spearheading this case and trustees from the bankruptcy had a series of meetings Wednesday at the KC Hall in Port Neches.  Wade Kimble lives a few miles from the TPC plant. The explosion left his home with significant damage by blowing doors off the hinges and blowing double-pane windows.  Now, Kimble is among the 8,000 people looking to get a piece of the settlement.  ""That's what i'm irritated at why and how they weren't able to have adequate coverage,"" Kimble said. ""It's just a drop in the bucket compared to the damages.""  TPC filed for bankruptcy in 2021 in Delaware. A settlement was recently announced.  Mark Sparks, a partner at Ferguson Law Firm in Beaumont, is one of the lawyers leading the lawsuits. He says thousands of claims were filed.  ""TPC chose to under-insure itself for its victims, so it didn't have enough insurance and ultimately filed for bankruptcy,"" he said.  Marks says people need to file claim forms to be considered for any of this money.  ""The claim form for these funds, the bankrupt funds that needs to be filed no later than August 1. If you have attorneys and they filed in the mdl they have hopefully sued along with us in the master complainants for all the defendants and this is not the end of the road for you,"" Marks said.  Sparks and other lawyers vow to keep fighting for the families of Mid-County.  They also say, this isn't the end of the legal road.  ""The lawyers myself and all the other firms have sued multiple new defendants that have contributed to this accident. We're seeking their entire insurance policies,"" Marks said.  Sparks said once they get all the claims in, they will decide what's fair and they'll come back to residents with proposals.  It may be year or so, before anyone gets any money, according to Sparks."

Instead, new research suggests it was a series of eruptions or multiple vents spewing volcanic material in rapid succession.  According to the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) Yellowstone Volcano Observatory 2022 Annual Report (opens in new tab), published May 4, fieldwork over the past year has provided new geological evidence that ""the formation of Yellowstone Caldera was much more complex than previously thought."" A caldera is a large crater that forms after the collapse of a volcano following an eruption.  Yellowstone is one of the world's biggest volcanic systems. It sits above one of Earth's ""hotspots"" — areas in the mantle where hot plumes rise and form volcanoes on the crust above. It has produced three caldera-forming eruptions (opens in new tab) in the past 3 million years: the Huckleberry Ridge Tuff eruption, 2.1 million years ago; the Mesa Falls eruption, 1.3 million years ago; and the Lava Creek eruption, 631,000 years ago.  What are super-eruptions?  The Huckleberry Ridge Tuff and Lava Creek events are considered super-eruptions because they expelled over 240 cubic miles (1,000 cubic kilometers) of material. The latter was responsible for the formation of the Yellowstone caldera. Mesa Falls erupted 67 cubic m (280 cubic km) of material, so — while still about 10 times bigger than the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens — is not considered a super-eruption.  Related: Where are most of Earth's volcanoes?  Previous research (opens in new tab) has shown that the Lava Creek super-eruption was not out of the blue; deposits at the Sour Creek Dome region east of the national park suggest that the giant blast was preceded by at least one eruption. Ignimbrite (volcanic rock formed via the deposits of the hot mix of material ejected during an eruption) found at the site had completely cooled before the main, mapped Lava Creek eruption took place.  Researchers have found evidence that there were multiple explosive events during the last super-eruption at Yellowstone. (Image credit: Noppawat Tom Charoensinphon/Getty Images)  To better understand the timeline of the eruption, scientists spent 2022 remapping and collecting samples at Sour Creek Dome.  ""It had always been known that there were at least two geological units [a volume of rock distinct from those surrounding it] from the eruption, and it was thought that there was little to no time gap between them,"" Michael Poland (opens in new tab), scientist-in-charge at the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory, told Live Science in an email. ""Now, we think there are more units. And we're just not sure what the time gap might have been, if any.""  So far, the team has found four previously unrecognized ignimbrite units at Sour Creek, suggesting at least four eruptive pulses. They also found two structures that appear to be eruptive vents, which may have been the sources of these rocks.  ""That could mean either several vents were active and/or there was time separation between the eruptions,"" Poland said. ""But we don't yet have the data we need to answer those questions yet.""  In 2020, scientists found the Huckleberry Ridge Tuff eruption (opens in new tab) — which ejected more than twice the amount of volcanic material as Lava Creek did — was also a phased event. Analysis of rocks at the site suggests there were three separate eruptions, with weeks to months between the first two, and years to decades between the second and third.  Yellowstone volcano is not expected to erupt anytime soon . However, the finding that the Lava Creek eruption may have followed a similar pattern to that of the Huckleberry Ridge Tuff eruption could give an idea of what to expect if and when Yellowstone does blow. ""These major caldera-forming eruptions might not be single events at Yellowstone, but instead have multiple phases,"" Poland said.  Researchers at the volcano now plan to carry out detailed examinations of the newly discovered units and the boundaries between them. This will allow them to paint a more detailed picture of what the Lava Creek eruption looked like — and maybe even what triggered it."

One person died and two were wounded by a Russian missile that got through and struck an industrial building in the southern region of Odesa, according to Serhiy Bratchuk, a spokesperson for the region's military administration.  Amid the recently intensified Russian air assaults, China said its special envoy met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during talks in Kyiv earlier this week with Ukraine's chief diplomat.  Beijing's peace proposal has so far yielded no apparent breakthrough in the war, and Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said Thursday that the warring parties needed to “accumulate mutual trust” for progress to be made.  Ukrainian officials sought during the talks to recruit China’s support for Kyiv’s own peace plan, according to Ukraine’s presidential office. Zelenskyy’s proposal includes the restoration of his country's territorial integrity, the withdrawal of Russian forces and holding Russian President Vladimir Putin legally accountable for the invasion in February 2022.  Meanwhile, Kremlin-installed authorities in occupied Crimea reported the derailment of eight train cars Thursday because of an explosion, prompting renewed suspicions about possible Ukrainian saboteur activity behind Russian lines. Russian state media reported that the train was carrying grain.  The state news agency RIA Novosti, quoting a source within the emergency services, said the incident occurred not far from the city of Simferopol. The Crimean Railway company said the derailment was caused by “the interference of unauthorized persons” and that there were no casualties.  Ukraine officials refuse to comment on possible acts of sabotage. Ukraine’s military intelligence spokesperson, Andriy Yusov, noted on Ukrainian television that Russian train lines “are also used to transport weapons, ammunition, armored vehicles.”  Overnight, loud explosions were heard in Kyiv as the Kremlin’s forces targeted the capital for the ninth time this month in a clear escalation after weeks of lull and before a much-anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive using newly supplied advanced Western weapons.  Debris fell on two Kyiv districts, starting a fire at a garage complex. There was no immediate word about any victims, Serhii Popko, head of the Kyiv Military Administration, said in a Telegram post.  Ukraine also shot down two Russian exploding drones and two reconnaissance drones, according to authorities.  The missiles were launched from Russian sea, air and ground bases, General Valerii Zaluzhnyi, the Ukrainian commander in chief, wrote on Telegram.  Several waves of missiles were aimed at areas of Ukraine between 9 p.m. Wednesday and 5:30 a.m. Thursday, he said.  Russian forces used strategic bombers from the Caspian region and apparently fired X-101 and X-55-type missiles developed during Soviet times, Kyiv authorities said. Russia then deployed reconnaissance drones over the capital.  In the last major air attack on Kyiv, on Tuesday, Ukrainian air defenses bolstered by sophisticated Western-supplied systems shot down all the incoming missiles, officials said.  That attack used hypersonic missiles, which repeatedly have been touted by Putin as providing a key strategic advantage. The missiles, which are among the most advanced weapons in Russia's arsenal, are difficult to detect and intercept because of their hypersonic speed and maneuverability.  But sophisticated Western air defense systems, including American-made Patriot missiles, have helped spare Kyiv from the kind of destruction witnessed along the main front line in the country’s east and south.  While the ground fighting is largely deadlocked along that front line, both sides are targeting each other's territory with long-range weapons.  The most intense fighting has focused on the battle for the city of Bakhmut and the surrounding area, in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk province, with a Ukrainian military official claiming Thursday that the army advanced up to 1.7 kilometers (more than a mile) there over the previous day.  At the same time, Yevgeny Prigozhin, the millionaire owner of Russia’s private military contractor Wagner whose troops have spearheaded the battle, claimed that Russian army units had retreated from their positions north of the city. Prigozhin is a frequent critic of the Russian military.  At least seven Ukrainian civilians were killed, including a 5-year-old boy, and 18 people were wounded over the previous 24 hours, the presidential office said.  Also, two people were wounded in a drone attack in Russia’s southern Kursk region, which borders Ukraine, the regional governor reported Thursday.  In a Telegram post, Roman Starovoit claimed Ukrainian forces dropped an explosive device from a drone on a sports and recreation complex.  ___  Yuras Karmanau contributed to this report from Tallinn, Estonia.  ___  Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine  ×  ×  ×  ×  ×  ×  ×  ×  ×"

It’s Tuesday, May 9 between 11 a.m. and 11:45 a.m.  There’s a lunch party of 20 at the Red Rooster and it’s being watched over by three Wagoner High School seniors while the boss is out of the restaurant temporarily.  Miranda’s Bakery and Café is selling items and getting ready for the lunch crowd.  An employee of BancFirst has arrived at the east parking lot to pick up someone to go to lunch.  The Locker Room is working on orders in the back.  Wagoner County Clerk Lori Hendricks is in her first floor office facing East Cherokee Street.  Seth Yoder from Edward Jones was driving on Cherokee Street to the office.  One of the Smokin’ Sisters employees was standing behind the bar, but is still making sure that the two Highway Patrolmen are getting their lunch order in fine fashion.  Then, it HITS!  An explosion rocks a major portion of downtown Wagoner.  Once the shock wore off, people came out of their businesses and looked around.  Hendricks looked out the window and saw some kind of large black canister-looking item in the westbound lane.  The parking spot at the BancFirst where someone was picked up for lunch has a small crater made by a round black piece of metal.  Other bits of debris fell even further south.  The Smokin’ Sisters employee nearly doubled over by the blast and noise. The Highway Patrolmen jumped up and left to see what they could do.  Miranda’s employees thought the stove had exploded.  Two of the Red Rooster assistants went out the back door to see what it was. Ironically, the party of 20 did not act like they had even heard it.  “We were all back in the kitchen when it happened and shook all the cups,” said Ashlee Jones.  “Alyssa (Langston) and Joci (Bryant) went out to see. I stayed inside.”  Langston also was caught off guard.  “It was pretty scary,” Langston said. “The whole building shook and it was a loud boom sound.”  Bryant said she thought it was part of some kind of construction.  Yoder was driving down the street and saw debris.  Wagoner Deputy Chief of Police, Tony Ponds, later told officials that the explosion came from just west of the railroad tracks and just south of West Cherokee at a recycling site.  A CNG bottle was being either crushed or recycled in some way without knowing there was something still in it or the release valve was still closed. It’s still not certain.  “It shook the window,” Hendricks said. “I saw it fall from the sky.”  Someone took the time to measure the distance from the debris that fell in the BancFirst parking lot from the recycle center – it measured a quarter of a mile!  There are probably many other reactions by other businesses, but the bottom line is: No one was hurt and there was no property damage, either.  Now, that’s a miracle."

But just 90 minutes before Ismael De Sousa opened Reunion Bread for business on Sunday, May 14, his bread oven exploded, sparking a large fire inside the bakery at The Source Hotel + Market Hall.  “Thank God no one got injured because it was massive,” De Sousa said. “The bread oven takes up three-quarters of the bakery, but no one was near the oven at the exact moment when it blew up and caught on fire.”  The Denver Fire Department arrived on the scene, as well as a line of shocked customers, but the fire, which De Sousa guessed was caused by a gas leak in the oven, was already out, so DFD helped fan out the remaining smoke.  De Sousa’s team was able to use the ovens at Bellota restaurant next door to save Mother’s Day, but many problems remained.  “It was still a big profit loss because we could only make bread out of that specific oven, and we could only make half of what we sell, like croissants, cookies and pastries,” De Sousa said. “We were running back and forth from the bakery to Bellota for six hours.”  For now, the 2023 James Beard Award semifinalist has temporarily closed the bakery at 3350 Brighton Blvd., but he hopes to reopen this weekend serving Portuguese and Venezuelan pastries, croissants and cookies baked in small convection ovens.  “I have to replace the bread oven, so we’re going to lose our bread business for a while,” De Sousa said. “That type of equipment in the U.S. is a lot of money, but it’s also four months out before I can order one, which will be an interesting few months.”  De Sousa hopes insurance will cover the cost of the bread oven before he has to consider starting a GoFundMe campaign. He wants customers to know that until the equipment is back and up running, the bakery’s product and quality might not be the exact same, since the oven is a crucial part of the baking process.  “When you come in, and there’s no bread, don’t get mad, just understand that something difficult has happened,” De Sousa said. “If you want to help, come buy a croissant or cup of coffee in the meantime.”  Subscribe to our new food newsletter, Stuffed, to get Denver food and drink news sent straight to your inbox."

The launchpad exploded, and the craft, the largest spaceship launched, soared through the air for about four minutes before failing to detach from its booster and exploding over Boca Chica. Residents reported ash and dust coatings on their cars and windows.  This test run brings us another small step toward Mars, but how tests and incidents like this one will affect people’s health and well-being is still an unanswered question. Aerospace engineering professor Moriba Jah from The University of Texas at Austin tells Inverse that we should prepare for more explosions as SpaceX continues trial flights, and that means understanding potential health outcomes.  What did the SpaceX explosion do to the air?  In Port Isabel’s immediate vicinity, visible debris fell from the sky.  This visible matter remained close to the launchpad, but microscopic debris certainly spread farther. An explosion like this results in fine particulate matter (PM2.5, referring to particles that are less than two and a half microns wide), which can hang in the air for about two weeks, according to Sarah Chambliss, an environmental science postdoctoral fellow at the University of Texas Dell Medical School Center for Health & Environment: Education & Research. She says these invisible particles can cause some of the most deleterious air pollution.  “They're totally invisible,” Chambliss tells Inverse. “You don't even smell them.”  These particles travel far, too. If they’re picked up by the wind, they “can disperse across, basically, continental scale,” Chambliss tells Inverse. This is the same reason why the effects of a wildfire in California register all the way over in New York.  The explosion in the air was a medley of heavy metals and rocket fuel. Starship’s Raptor engine, in particular, runs on liquid oxygen and methane — and Starship had 34 engines. “Particulate matter that's high in metal content is more toxic,” Chambliss says.  Does this pollution impact our health?  Inhaling elevated levels of PM2.5, Chambliss says, is linked to inflammation, increased risk of an asthma emergency, increased incidence of asthma, and lung cancer. However, a single event like this can’t be fully responsible for health damage. “You wouldn’t be able to attribute any individual health outcome to an explosion like this,” Chambliss tells Inverse.  More immediately, this explosion harms our environment. Environmental organizations, including the Center for Biological Diversity, the American Bird Conservancy, the Surfrider Foundation, Save RGV, and the Carrizo/Comecrudo Nation of Texas, filed a suit against the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for the damages committed.  How can SpaceX prevent damage next time?  Highly accurate models that give a better idea of potential damage, Jah says, could demonstrate in computer simulations the likelihood of particular outcomes, such as explosions. Aerospace engineering employs these high-fidelity models in aircraft design, but Jah says they’re not yet part of standard practice. Especially when it comes to firsts, like the historically huge and powerful Starship, high-fidelity modeling is essential because learning from mistakes could be too costly.  “If it's all learning from trial and error, that is to the detriment of the environment,” he tells Inverse.  SpaceX has not made a public comment on the explosion’s impact on public health or our environment and did not respond to Inverse for comment in time for publication.  Following the explosion, the FAA has grounded SpaceX’s Starship rockets until it finds that “any system, process, or procedure related to the mishap does not affect public safety,” the FAA said in a statement.  “I do think that it's the ethical responsibility of polluters to deal with the fallout of their pollution,” Chambliss says."

Now, for the first time, astronomers have spotted the radio signature of just such an event in a galaxy more than 400 million light-years away. The finding, published today in Nature, holds tantalizing clues as to what the companion star must have been like.  An explosive star death  As stars up to eight times heavier than our Sun start to run out of nuclear fuel in their core, they puff off their outer layers. This process gives rise to the colorful clouds of gas misleadingly known as planetary nebulae, and leaves behind a dense, compact hot core known as a white dwarf.  Our own Sun will undergo this transition in 5 billion years or so, then slowly cool and fade away. However, if a white dwarf somehow puts on weight, a self-destruct mechanism kicks in when it gets heavier than about 1.4 times the mass of our Sun.  The subsequent thermonuclear detonation destroys the star in a distinctive kind of explosion called a Type Ia supernova.  But where would the extra mass come from to fuel such a bang?  We used to think it could be gas being stripped off a bigger companion star in a close orbit. But stars tend to be messy eaters, spilling gas everywhere.  A supernova explosion would shock any spilt gas and make it glow at radio wavelengths. Despite decades of searching however, not a single young Type Ia supernova has ever been detected with radio telescopes.  Instead, we began to think Type Ia supernovae must be pairs of white dwarfs spiraling inwards and merging together in a relatively clean fashion, leaving no gas to shock – and no radio signal.  A rare type of supernova  Supernova 2020eyj was discovered by a telescope in Hawai'i on March 23 2020. For the first seven weeks or so it behaved in much the same way as any other Type Ia supernova.  But for the next five months, it stopped fading in brightness. Around the same time, it began to show features indicating gas that was unusually rich in helium.  We began to suspect Supernova 2020eyj belonged to a rare subclass of Type Ia supernovae in which the blast wave, moving at more than 10,000 kilometers per second, sweeps past gas that could only have been stripped off the outer layers of a surviving companion star.  To try to confirm our hunch, we decided to test if there was enough gas being shocked to produce a radio signal. As the supernova is too far north to observe with telescopes like the Australia Telescope Compact Array near Narrabri, we instead used an array of radio telescopes spread across the United Kingdom to observe the supernova about 20 months after the explosion.  To our great surprise, we had the first-ever clear detection of an ""infant"" Type Ia supernova at radio wavelengths, confirmed by a second observation some five months later. Could this be the ""smoking gun"" that not all Type Ia supernovae are caused by the merger of two white dwarfs?  frameborder=""0″ allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"" allowfullscreen>  Patience pays off  One of the more remarkable properties of Type Ia supernovae is that they all seem to reach pretty much the same peak brightness. This is consistent with them all having reached a similar critical mass before exploding.  This very attribute allowed astronomer Brian Schmidt and colleagues to reach their Nobel Prize-winning conclusion in the late 1990s: that the universe's expansion since the Big Bang is not slowing down under gravity (as everyone had expected), but is accelerating due to the effects of what we now call dark energy.  So, Type Ia supernovae are important cosmic objects, and the fact we still don't know exactly how and when these stellar explosions occur, or what makes them so consistent, has been a worry to astronomers.  In particular, if pairs of merging white dwarfs can range in total mass up to almost three times the mass of our Sun, why should they all release about the same amount of energy?  Our hypothesis (and radio confirmation) that Supernova 2020eyj occurred when enough helium gas was stripped off the companion star and onto the surface of the white dwarf to push it just over the mass limit, provides a natural explanation for this consistency.  The question now is why we haven't seen this radio signal before in any other Type Ia supernova. Perhaps we tried to detect them too soon after the explosion, and gave up too easily. Or maybe not all companion stars are as helium-rich and prodigious in shedding their gaseous outer layers.  But as our study has shown, patience and persistence sometimes pays off in ways we never expected, allowing us to hear the dying whispers of a distant star.

More than two dozen people were injured after an explosion in Tijuana, Mexico, a few miles south of the San Ysidro Port of Entry Tuesday morning, prompting a large response from rescuers from various local agencies.  The video shows an SUV approaching and a pair of pedestrians, one of whom appears to be using a cane, caught in the blast. After the shock wave hits, the people are down in the street, and one slowly struggles upright. The other never appears to awaken. The SUV slowly backs down the street as the dust settles, with debris now scattered across the street.  The boom shook the Blancas building in Tijuana's East Zone at around 9:35 a.m. The building houses a print shop, a furniture store, a car detailing shop and a spare parts store. Atop the businesses were apartments that were not meant to be inhabited, according to the Tijuana Civil Protection Agency.

Tijuana fire crews evacuated several people from the building and began rescue work. Authorities initially reported two people were believed to be trapped at the scene. After an hour and a half of work, firefighters were able to free one person who was trapped in the basement. The individual suffered first- and second-degree burns and was one of several transported to area hospitals, the agency said.  At least 25 people were injured, according to the Tijuana Fire Department — four with serious injuries, six in moderate condition and 15 with minor injuries. Rafael Cabillo, Tijuana's fire director, told Telemundo 20 that the search for other victims continues.  ""The houses that were in the upper part were already red-tagged and the upper part should not be inhabited,"" Bernardo Villegas, director of Tijuana Civil Protection, said in Spanish. ""I think that there was a repair of these houses and they rented them. All the people who were evacuated did not leave with injuries; [they] were outside the [explosion] area.""  The owner of the building, who did not want to provide his name to Telemundo 20, confirmed that another explosion occurred a few years ago in the same place.  ""The second location has an underground gas build-up. I can't tell you why; this is the second time this has happened to us. The disaster was four times bigger than [four] years ago,"" he said in Spanish.  The Secretary of Security and Citizen Protection, the fire department, the municipal police, Civil Protection, the Red Cross and seven private ambulances responded to the incident.  Around 10 a.m., Mayor Montserrat Caballero also arrived at the scene.  This is a developing story. Details may change as information is released."

These forthcoming rules hold immense potential for the crypto landscape, with several coins poised to benefit, including notable contenders such as $Lina, $ACH, $CFX, and $COCOS.  CFX is the native token of the CryptoFights platform, while COCOS is the native token of the Cocos-BCX blockchain. Both coins are based in China and have a significant Chinese user base.  CFX was launched in 2018 and is based on the Neo blockchain. It is a decentralized gaming platform that allows users to play games, earn rewards, and trade in-game items. COCOS was launched in 2019 and is based on the Ethereum blockchain. It is a decentralized gaming platform that focuses on blockchain-based games.  Both CFX and COCOS have been successful in attracting users and developers. CFX has a market capitalization of over $1 billion and COCOS has a market capitalization of over $500 million. Both coins are listed on major cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance and Huobi.  CFX and COCOS are both promising projects with the potential to disrupt the gaming industry.  SFC’s regulations are set to instill confidence in the crypto sector  Driven by a steadfast commitment to investor protection and market integrity, the SFC’s comprehensive and robust regulations are set to instill confidence in the crypto sector. By mandating VASPs to obtain licenses, conduct thorough customer due diligence, maintain transaction records, and comply with anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) measures, these regulations are poised to create a more secure and compliant environment for all stakeholders.  Recognizing the significance of these regulations, the Hong Kong Blockchain Association has praised the SFC’s proactive approach, hailing the rules as a positive step towards enhancing the cryptocurrency industry in Hong Kong. By establishing a framework that balances innovation and security, these regulations are poised to unlock the full potential of cryptocurrencies and drive further adoption in the region.  While critics have voiced concerns about potential innovation stifling or insufficient investor protection, it is essential to appreciate that the SFC has meticulously calibrated these regulations to strike the right balance. By taking a risk-based enforcement approach, the SFC aims to target those VASPs that pose the greatest risk to investors, leaving room for growth and fostering an environment that encourages responsible innovation.  As the industry eagerly awaits the implementation of these forward-looking regulations, Hong Kong’s cryptocurrency landscape is poised for a remarkable transformation. With $Lina, $ACH, $CFX, and $COCOS among the frontrunners benefiting from enhanced regulatory oversight, the stage is set for these coins to shine and capture the attention of savvy investors seeking promising opportunities.  The embrace of these regulations by Hong Kong signifies the region’s commitment to becoming a global hub for cryptocurrency innovation. As the regulatory framework solidifies, these coins and the broader crypto market are well-positioned for a bright and prosperous future, built on trust, transparency, and investor confidence.

Vulcan will be the successor to ULA's Delta IV and Atlas V rockets. ULA was set up in 2006 as a joint venture between Boeing Co. (BA) and Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT). Since then, the company's Delta and Atlas rockets have been used to send more than 150 missions into orbit.  ""I expect we will see that [first Vulcan] launch sometime between summer and later this year,"" Bruno said during a streamed interview at the Human to Mars Summit in Washington on Tuesday.  ULA had initially planned for a Vulcan debut launch in May, but that was pushed back when a Vulcan rocket's upper stage suffered an anomaly during testing at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama in March, according to Space.com. The explosion was first reported by Ars Technica. Bruno subsequently tweeted that a hydrogen leak caused an explosion during the test.  Space.com reported that the upper stage that exploded was not part of the hardware for the debut Vulcan launch. ""We will sort that out, we will resolve it,"" Bruno said Tuesday.  Related:Virgin Galactic sets sights on first commercial launch  ULA undertook Vulcan rocket tests to simulate a launch day at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station last week.  Vulcan's booster propulsion is provided by a pair of BE-4 engines manufactured by Blue Origin, which was founded by Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos. ""I am very happy with my partner there,"" said Bruno.  The BE-4 engines use liquid oxygen and liquefied natural gas, a commercially available form of methane. Unlike other rocket propellants, such as kerosene, liquefied natural gas eliminates the need for expensive and complex pressurization systems, such as helium, which is in increasingly scarce supply, according to ULA.  The new ULA rocket also integrates up to six Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC) Solid Rocket Boosters, or SRBs.

These tremors were first recorded on Saturday, after the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GUES)—the official body that monitors the underground—received ""more than 60"" tips from people in Bornholm about ""earthquake-like tremors"" reported in the afternoon.  They described the tremors as deep rumbling, shaking and rattling, and changing pressure in the ear.  Initially, many falsely believed that they may have been caused by earthquakes. Seismologists had theorised that they may have originated from controlled explosions in Poland, more than nearly 90 miles (145 km) to the south.  However, on Monday, the GUES clarified that the tremors were ""not caused by earthquakes, but by pressure waves from an event in the atmosphere."" However, they came from ""an unknown source.""  ""The seismologists can report that it is unlikely that the tremors originate from a controlled explosion in Poland, which was carried out shortly before the first reports of tremors on Bornholm,"" the body known as GEUS said in a statement. Scientists develop fabric made of 'Fungi' which needs no stitching Danish media reported that police had received complaints from the public about the tremor on the eastern part of the island. The tremors also caused a crack in the wall of some of the houses. But no one was injured.  The Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland said that seismic tremors were measured at a magnitude of 2.3.  Polish authorities have said that there was intensive activity during the Anakonda23 exercise in Ustka, northern Poland, involving jet fighters and live firing of artillery munitions.  GEUS, an independent research and advisory institution within Denmark’s Ministry of Climate, Energy and Utilities, said that it had two seismographs on Bornholm that collect data around the clock.  Bornholm is home to nearly 40,000 people. It is a rocky island in the Baltic Sea, south of Sweden, northeast of Germany and north of Poland.  (With inputs from agencies)"

The game is a MOBA-like game where teams of three work to disable the opposing team’s barriers and score, akin to air hockey. Each of the 15 characters brings something unique to the table, such as Rune’s barriers that double as both goalie tools and ways to damage enemy players or Era’s powerful support tools that buff allies and debuff opposing players.  The game launched with 15 playable characters, three of which were added on the initial release oof the game after it left Steam Early Access. The game also saw console ports over the past two weeks (to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and Xbox consoles). Over the past week, Odyssey has been teasing new content, which comes in today’s big patch.  This update brings two brand-new playable characters to the game, Octavia and Vyce. Both of them also have kit breakdowns released that we’ll go over. First, Octavia; her kit focuses on buffing herself and maintaining momentum, as her Secondary ability is an infinitely stacking speed boost that extends so long as you’re hitting the Core. Her Primary ability is a projectile that deals damage and slows, making it a good disruption tool. Finally, Octavia’s Special emits five pulses that damage an area around her periodically.  You can view Octavia’s gameplay trailer below.  Comparatively, Vyce looks to be quite a powerful offensive character. She has access to a stun with an area-of-effect radius in her Secondary slot, and her Primary is a projectile with a pretty good range. Vyce’s Special ability involves her remaining immobile and charging up a big shockwave that grows in size the longer you charge it. Upon release, anything inside the shockwave takes big damage. While charging, Vyce has full knockback immunity but can still take damage.  You can view Vyce’s gameplay trailer below.  Today’s update for Omega Strikers also contains a new battle arena in the form of the Demon Dais stage. This new stage has two separate barriers in the form of large speakers on each side of the field with two barriers within. The update also has new skins for Kai, Atlas, and Ai.Mi, and some balance changes (including a full rework for Asher) which can all be read here.  We’ll continue to update as more information on Omega Strikers, including DLC, trailers, updates, and more, as it’s released. Omega Strikers is available now on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam."

The last days of Winter grew closer and the sun began shining a little brighter with every passing moment. Everything was seemingly perfect for the average fan of Daft Punk, that was until the duo made a rare appearance on social media to announce that after 28 years of groundbreaking production and mesmerizing melodies, they are calling it quits. The announcement of their split was paired with a clip from the closing scenes of their 2006 film “Electrorama”, which saw the pair in full Daft Punk garb shaking hands and walking off, only for one member to reveal a bomb and promptly explode. That explosion became more than a cinematic trick as every blog and Daft Punk fan page blew up with fond memories and grief for one of the most successful music groups in recent memory.  Attempting to sum up Daft Punk’s impact on music in one article is a fool’s errand, so let’s focus on a moment in their career that changed the Daft Punk history books as we knew it. 2013 was far from the group’s “break out” year but it did see a massive resurgence in popularity for the duo, and not because an old classic was resurfaced for the sake of social media. 10 years ago (5/17/13), Daft Punk released what would be their final album together. Random Access Memories birthed the tremendously popular single “Get Lucky”, which featured Pharell Williams crooning over funky live instrumentation which included the now iconic guitar melodies strummed out by the great Nile Rodgers. While the album now marks the last official release for Daft Punk, its impact on Daft Punk’s career was obvious long before their break up 8 years later.  Random Access Memories is the duo’s first studio album since 2005’s Human After All which saw the band deconstruct their signature production style and rebuild it into an industrial wall of sound. Coming off what could now be considered Daft Punk’s most aggressive LP and giving fans plenty of time in between releases, Daft Punk was able to completely wipe the slate clean. They’ve already pushed the boundaries of electronic pop and their final album would aim to conquer an area of music that Daft Punk never had the opportunity to take part in. The album has the duo shifting their focus to a more disco-friendly sonic direction and began incorporating live instrumentation into their recording process, leaving only a few programmed drum machines and vintage vocoder melodies as traces of their past sound. This allowed Daft Punk’s music to sound larger than ever, with songs like the explosive intro “Give Life Back To Music” and the Paul Williams-assisted “Touch” bringing a sleek shine to the LP. Random Access Memories is driven by deep grooves, infectious rhythms, and pure love for dance music, and the extensive list of A-list collaborators is only the icing on the cake.  You know there is something special about an album when it takes this long into talking about it to mention that there is a stirringly beautiful Julian Casablancas ballad on the tracklist. For the first time in their careers, Daft Punk opened their studio doors to outside collaborators to help work on a studio album of theirs and they brought in a cast of characters only Daft Punk can assemble. Along with the aforementioned Casablancas and Paul Williams, the likes of Panda Bear, Todd Edwards, Pharrell Williams, and Nile Rodgers are credited as guests on Random Access Memories. What makes these appearances so special is how Daft Punk deployed them, the duo brought these features into their world to uplift their compositions, only bringing in guests when necessary. They could’ve gotten anyone to sing on “The Game of Love” but they seemed to be just as happy with their robotically smooth vocals taking the spotlight. The Panda Bear-assisted “Doin’ It Right” is a minimal, repetitive dance track that has Bear harmonizing with those same vocals from “The Game of Love”, not the usual Panda Bear ascetic but a role he filled beyond expectations. Daft Punk’s use of features on Random Access Memories speaks to not only their overall creativity but may have hinted that their break up nearly a decade later was clear from the release of the album, using Random Access Memories to knock off some bucket list collaborations in a sensational fashion.  Random Access Memories now has somewhat of a bittersweet taste to it 10 years later. While it now acts as Daft Punk’s swan song, it also stands as a testament to two musicians who approached their art with tireless creativity and delivered unforgettable moments of pure fun and musicianship. In 2013 it seemed like Daft Punk had nothing else to prove, they had hits and had won over the hearts of snobby critics and hard-headed music fans alike with their refreshing take on electronic pop music. They approached their fourth studio album as if they had already decided it was their last and left nothing to be desired. The 13 songs that comprise the LP take you through the colorful cosmos of Daft Punk as the duo waves goodbye in an explosion of vivid arrangements, undeniable chemistry, and, most important of all, unforgettable electronic music."

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak greeted Zelenskyy with a handshake and hug after the president's helicopter landed at Chequers, the British leader's official country retreat. It was Zelenskyy's second trip to the U.K. since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, and the fifth European country he's visited in three days.  He is seeking more military aid as Ukraine prepares a long-anticipated spring offensive to retake Russian-occupied territory. The Ukrainian leader also visited Italy, the Vatican, Germany and France.  Russia reacted to the U.K.'s new pledge ""extremely negatively,"" but also doubts that the missiles and drones would drastically change the course of the war, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday.  ""Britain aspires to be at the forefront among countries that continue to pump weapons into Ukraine,"" Peskov said. ""We repeat once again: It cannot yield any drastic and fundamental influence on the way the special military operation (in Ukraine) is unfolding. But definitely it leads to further destruction. ... It makes this whole story for Ukraine much more complicated.""  Zelenskyy said one of the missions of his European travels that started Saturday was to build a ""fighter jet coalition"" to provide Ukraine with vital military power in the air. He said more work was needed on that front.  While the U.K. will not provide the planes, the prime minister said the country would join the coalition and begin a previously announced training program for Ukrainian fighter pilots as soon as this summer.  The U.K., one of Ukraine's major military allies, has provided short-range missiles, Challenger tanks and trained 15,000 Ukrainian troops on British soil. Last week, the government announced it had sent Ukraine Storm Shadow cruise missiles, which have a range of more than 150 miles. The British missiles were the first known shipment of longer-range weaponry that Kyiv has long sought from its allies.  Sunak's office said it was giving Ukraine hundreds more air defense missiles, as well as ""long-range attack drones"" with a reach of more than 120 miles.  ""This is a crucial moment in Ukraine's resistance to a terrible war of aggression they did not choose or provoke,"" Sunak said. ""They need the sustained support of the international community to defend against the barrage of unrelenting and indiscriminate attacks that have been their daily reality for over a year.  ""We must not let them down,"" the prime minister added.  Sunak plans to push allies at a meeting of the Group of Seven leaders in Japan later this week to deliver more support to Ukraine, his representative said.  As Zelenskyy visited European capitals, Russia increased its attacks across Ukraine with drones and missiles. Russia shelled two communities Sunday in the northern border province of Sumy, regional officials said on Telegram. They said 109 explosions were recorded.  Zelenskyy's office said Monday that Russian attacks had killed nine civilians and injured 19 in the past day. Six of the deaths were in southern Ukraine's Kherson province. Two civilians were killed in Chuhuiv in Kharkiv province, and one in Prymorsk, on the Azov Sea coast about 12 miles from Russian-occupied Berdyansk.  The presidential office also reported that Marhanets, which lies across the river from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, was shelled.  Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti reported that an acting regional interior minister appointed by Moscow, Igor Kornet, was injured in an explosion at a barbershop in the Russian-occupied city of Luhansk. The leader of the Luhansk People's Republic, a separatist-held region of Ukraine that Moscow illegally annexed, was quoted as saying a bomb caused the explosion.  Assassination attempts and sabotage attacks have increased in Russian-occupied territory as well as Russia proper. Russian authorities often blame Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv rarely acknowledges such attacks.  Zelenskyy traveled to Britain from Paris, where he met Sunday with French President Emmanuel Macron and secured a pledge of light tanks, armored vehicles and air defense systems.      About 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers will receive training in France this year and nearly 4,000 others in Poland, Macron's office said.  Speaking Monday on the French television network TF1, Macron said training on French fighter jets such as the Mirage 2000 ""can start now"" but rejected the idea of France delivering warplanes to Ukraine.  Zelenskyy also met with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Sunday. It was his first visit to Berlin since the start of the invasion and came a day after the German government announced military aid for Ukraine worth more than $3 billion.  Modern Western hardware is considered crucial if Ukraine is to succeed in its planned counteroffensive. During his European trip, Zelenskyy said Ukraine would aim to liberate Russian-occupied areas within Ukraine's internationally recognized borders and would not attack Russian territory.  Among areas Russia still occupies are the Crimean Peninsula and parts of eastern Ukraine with mainly Russian-speaking populations."

LDO tried to break an important resistance area but failed.  With strong bullish signals again this Tuesday, expect a rally that could extend all the way up to $3.37.  Lido DAO (LDO) price has set the performance bar rather high for itself this summer. With bulls chasing price action higher on Monday, a rejection occurred as bulls ventured to attack $2.20, where both a pivotal level and the 55-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) are being used by bears as defensive structures. Once that area is reclaimed by bulls this week, expect to see a rally that could go well into the summer and hit $3.37 with a 60% profit in the books.  Lido DAO price to be the trade of the season out of the bunch  Lido DAO price is already heading for a very solid performance with a 10% gain already on record for this week. From the looks of it, bulls are back with a vengeance and have already erased all incurred losses for May. If bulls play this right, this could be the best recovery trade of the year, and LDO is set to outperform some peers in the process.  LDO first needs to pare the selling pressure from bears at $2.20, where they have built a fortress around that historically pivotal level and the 55-day SMA that resides nearby. With the bullish performance setting the tone for this week, expect to see that level being torn down later on Tuesday and bulls heading for $2.60. The rally should continue into July with a few catalysts along the way that could lift LDO higher and head toward $3.37.  LDO/USD 4H-chart  A threat to the downside could come with another rejection at $2.20 and one of the tail risks in the US inflating again, such as the on-again-off-again banking turmoil or the debt ceiling negotiations. Expect then to see a leg lower with $2 doubtful to hold. Rather look for $1.85 and the 200-day SMA in between $2 and $1.85 as a circuit breaker to slow down any violent drops depending on the severity of the tail risk or catalyst."

In a jaw-dropping +70,000% moon-shot, millionaires were made in hours in the latest race to profit.  Now in an aggressive cascading retracement, it is clear early backers are securing their profit.  DEXTools / SHROOMS USD  Indeed, despite pittance liquidity of $179k, $SHROOMS trading volume has surged to a whopping $5.56m in the past 24 hours.  This brings $SHROOMS market cap to a lowly $1.43m indicating there could still be room for growth if $SHROOMS is able to consolidate at a high support level - but not much else is known about the coin.  With an emerging tribe of 1,790 holders and over 2000 transactions in the opening 24 hours $SHROOMS seems to be the most recent meme coin to gain traction.  How to Get in Early on Meme Coin Moonshots?  With millionaires made in the opening minutes of meme coin launches, as brave DEX explorers discover hidden gems poised to explode to the upside - many are asking how can you get in early on meme coin moon-shots?  After all, by the time you've seen a +70,000% gain - it is likely far too late to make major profits and this leaves you exposed to potential downside dumps.  Some of the obvious steps you can take to ensure you're investing in only the highest quality meme coins (and avoid getting rug-pulled!) are:  Check the meme coin's smart contract using a Honeypot Detector (ensuring you can sell to lock-in new found gains). Check the funding of deployer's wallets (examine the prelaunch transactions of deployment wallet, ideally finding a 'clean' wallet, in which the only transactions are the purchase of ETH and the creation of the smart contract address). Check if the contract address is verified (this can be done on Etherscan). Check if meme coin liquidity has been locked (it is important to ensure LPs are locked to ensure you can complete later sale of coins). Check if the meme coin project has an active Website, Twitter account, Telegram and Medium (the greater the social media presence, the less chance of a rug pull). Double-check whether the token has both buys and sells (using tools that monitor DEX transactions to avoid honey pots). Check the token holders (if huge swathes of supply are held by few wallets, this could lead to seismic dumping action). Check the buy and sell fees (if transaction fees to deployer are higher than 10% avoid).  By following these steps you can begin to develop a well-researched understanding of what makes a meme coin legitimate, however, to undertake these checks will require a depth of crypto expertise and a familiarity with complex DEX tools.

The fire gets away and runs and potentially causes a larger fire,"" Wilbourn said.Firefighters from the Sacramento Fire Department and the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District responded to a homeless encampment fire Tuesday afternoon. A spokesperson with the Sacramento Fire Department told KCRA 3 that trees started to catch fire just after 4 p.m. on 14th Avenue near Power Inn Road in Sacramento. Fire crews arrived within minutes and quickly put out the flames.Cellphone video sent to KCRA 3 shows the moments the flames jumped into the higher branches of the trees. Amalia Valencia, who works nearby, said the fire started when she was finishing up some paperwork at the office.""I heard a loud bang — a loud explosion,"" Valencia said. ""It's very scary. I mean, our shop is just right across.""Valencia said she figured the fire had started at the homeless encampment, which she said has caused issues in the area before. Debris and trash can be seen all across that section of land. Valencia said she is grateful the fire did not spread too far, but she added that she is concerned about the summer months.""I had walked through here before and I saw that there were several gas tanks and a barbecue grill on this section area, and I had told my brother, 'Oh, that’s eventually going to end up happening,'"" Valencia said.Sacramento fire officials said firefighters are currently going through wildfire refresher training so that everyone can be prepared to battle fires this summer. Experts are also reminding people who live in areas near dry brush to create some defensible space around their homes."

I ran to my mom, asking her if we could go there in the summer, and she kept nodding her head until it was convincing enough for me to go back to sleep. Ten years later, the New York City lights keep me awake all night long. I remain in a waking dream.  On my plane to NYC, I kept wondering why the Stanford in New York program would choose that our dorms be located in Brooklyn as opposed to Manhattan, the heart of the city. In my head, that only meant missing out on events, a longer commute and wasted hours. I was wrong.  Brooklyn Heights feels exactly like my hometown, Saida, while being nothing like it. It is close to the city but also far from it. Brooklyn Heights, just like Saida, is the best of both worlds.  The Stanford in New York apartments are next to the Brooklyn Heights promenade, which offers among the most iconic views in the city. You can see the Brooklyn Bridge, the Empire State building, the Chrysler building and even the Statue of Liberty while standing there. You can peek into the chaos and the rush of the cars while basking in the sun, watching it go down and making sure you take the right pictures so that you will not have to come back tomorrow, which you already know you will.  On Sunday, I sat there on a bench next to a married couple, with my favorite Montague Street Bagels, and I noticed how most people were silent, even though their footsteps were audible.  On Monday, as I took a lunch break from my work at the NYC Commission on Human Rights, I couldn’t even call my mom because I was distracted by the conversations around me, curious to know more, but also because I couldn’t hear a word she said.  Beirut has changed a lot after the August 2020 explosion, but it remains a lively city that blooms during the summers when foreigners and immigrants come back to celebrate togetherness and visit their old memories. Being in Beirut means hearing music from every corner, having to cover your ears when cars start honking at a minor inconvenience and listening to conversations of girls your age planning their weekend getaways because they wanted to “party the pain away.”  I’d spend my days in Beirut, hopping from one friend’s apartment to the next, eating take-out food and complaining about the skyrocketing prices. Sometimes, I was too enraptured in that chaos, thinking about relocating with no real plan or strategy. However, all I needed was a single voice message from my mom, telling me what my grandmother cooked today and how I should come back so we could watch “Olympus has fallen” for the tenth time together; telling me to come back to Saida.  Saida has also changed a lot after the Beirut explosion. People hide their trauma behind their smiles in the most noticeable way possible. What characterizes Saida is the people inhabiting it. Living there, you have to negotiate for thirty minutes before accepting a gift, try out every food on the table or explain to the host that it wouldn’t be personal if you fail and end every day with a coffee run with your favorite people, bumping into at least five of your least favorite people. Saida is more intimate. You spend your whole life dreaming of getting out and once you do, you start counting down the days till you’re back. While I enjoy traveling to new places, I’ve never met people like the ones in Saida.  Saida is the perfect balance to Beirut, but Beirut is not the same without Saida. The same way that Brooklyn Heights is the perfect balance to Manhattan, but Manhattan is not the same without Brooklyn Heights."

Last season the Green Raiders made it back to the District 1 tournament, but were bounced quickly in the opening round. The last time Ridley hosted a playoff game before Tuesday was in 2017. And the last time the team won in the postseason, home or away, came in 2015, when Bosak and Ridley’s current senior class were elementary school students.  The Hofstra recruit wanted to put on a show against No. 19 Pennsbury and lead the 14th-seeded Green Raiders to victory in the postseason. He didn’t disappoint.  Bosak scored five goals, all in the first half, and dominated the face-off circle in Ridley’s 20-7 trouncing of the visiting Falcons. Ridley (11-8) will travel to No. 3 Pennridge Thursday.  “It’s been seven years since we had a home playoff game,” Bosak said. “I told the guys that this means too much for us to go down. This is the last time playing here at (Phil Marion Field) for the seniors, so we came out fired up.”  Pennsbury had no answer for Bosak, who won 21 of 25 face offs and set the tempo for the Green Raiders offense. After Michael DeZutel gave Pennsbury a 1-0 lead less than two minutes into regulation, Bosak answered to put Ridley on the board.  Bosak found the back of the net three times in a span of two minutes, 36 seconds at the end of the first half. His explosion in the waning minutes before halftime put the Green Raiders in firm control. He pulled off some sweet moves, too, juking and twisting his way to his third goal.  Kolby Ranniello tallied to cut Pennsbury’s deficit to 7-5 with 1:23 left in the second period, but all that did was anger Bosak, who won the ensuing faceoff and darted to the net to score his fourth goal. His fifth and final goal with 55 seconds to go extended Ridley’s advantage to 9-5.  “We came out in sync,” Bosak said. “I haven’t seen us have a game like this all year with this type of energy. Especially from the crowd, too.”  While Bosak was thrilled to see his teammates rise to the occasion, he didn’t mince words about his individual performance.  “I was on today,” he said. “My wingers helped me as well, but I think I was on today.”  The Green Raiders put the game out of reach when they scored five of the final six goals of the third period. They outscored the Falcons11-2 after halftime.  Luke Showalter had a huge day with four goals and two assists. Defensive middie Bobby Soper and Nate McLaughlin, the backup faceoff man, got in on the fun with a goal each. Cole Wills chipped with two. Colin Wintrode excelled in net, stopping nine shots.  “Most of the year, we were in a lot of hard battles and our backups didn’t really get to play all that much,” Bosak said. “But tonight, we gave them a chance. Everyone got involved and that was great to see.”"

Koa Purugganan was recognized last week during the agency’s annual honorary awards celebration, which was held at Reagan National Airport in Arlington, Virginia.  Koa can be seen working regularly at LAS with 6-year-old German Shorthaired Pointer Bimbo-Boom, affectionately nicknamed “Bubba.” Koa has been a canine handler since 2019.  TSA has more than 400 canine handlers across the country who work alongside explosive detection dogs who are trained to work in busy transportation environments. Together, the handlers and dogs are a visible and effective added layer of security within the nation’s transportation system.  “We are thrilled that Koa has been recognized for the outstanding job he along with his four-legged partner Bubba do for the airport community. Koa’s commitment and leadership have made our canine operation at LAS second to none,” said TSA Federal Security Director for Nevada Karen Burke. “Koa is a team player who proactively seeks ways to improve the effectiveness of the canine program while also taking time to mentor other canine handlers to help them improve in the job they do. He and Bubba are exceptional members of our team and are deserving of this award.""  Koa has distinguished himself as a lead trainer for the local canine teams, developing multiple scenarios to test the proficiency  of the dogs and handlers in a variety of situations and locations. He has also implemented daily schedules that maximize the use of canines in screening operations and reduced “down time” for canine teams during daily work assignments.  TSA canines and handlers are most often seen at airports working in the security checkpoint, assisting with the efficiency and effectiveness of TSA’s screening operations. They are also trained to work in mass transit, commuter rail, maritime passenger ferry environments and in other busy venues supporting security operations for marquis events.  These canines are able to conduct a real-time threat assessment of travelers going through the security checkpoint. If a dog alerts its handler to the presence of explosive odor, TSA follows an established procedure to resolve the alarm.  Koa joined TSA in 2014 as a TSA officer (TSO), was later promoted to Lead TSO before being named Supervisory TSO at Kona International Airport on the Island of Hawaii. Koa transitioned to the role of canine handler and began working at LAS. Together, Koa and Bubba supported security operations at the 2022 NFL Draft in Las Vegas and have participated in Reno 911 Training. Bubba is an energetic dog who loves to come to work. When he is at home with Koa, he enjoys running around in the backyard. His favorite reward toy is anything that squeaks.  This is the not the first time the canine program at LAS has been recognized nationally. In August 2021, TSA announced that Alona, then a four-year-old Golden Retriever and explosives detection canine was the winner of the TSA “Cutest Canine” contest. Alona and her handler Vanessa continue to work at LAS.  TSA at LAS is consistently one of the busiest airports in the country, screening more than 23 million departing passengers in 2022."

Amazon Prime members can now add pickleball coverage to their list of membership benefits.  Amazon's Prime Video streaming platform announced Tuesday it's signed a multiyear deal with the Professional Pickleball Association for global streaming rights to four live PPA Tour events per year, including the 2023-2024 PPA Tour World Championship Series.  Amazon Prime's coverage will kick off with a four-day tournament starting Thursday from the Atlanta Open in Peachtree Corners, Georgia.  ""When something has an explosion in growth, naturally it catches our eye,"" Charlie Neiman, head of sports partnerships at Amazon Prime Video, told CNBC.  Amazon said its coverage will include games with top-ranked players such as Ben Johns, Anna Leigh Walters and Anna Bright.  Connor Pardoe, CEO and cofounder of the Pro Pickleball Association, called the deal ""monumental"" for the burgeoning league.  ""It's important for the evolution of the pro game, the game as a whole, and a nice step forward for the professional players,"" he added.  Prime's deal with the PPA also deepens its commitment to the world of sports streaming rights, which range from Thursday Night Football to emerging sports leagues and sports documentaries.  Neiman says Amazon has had tremendous success investing in other emerging properties such as MMA's One Championship or Overtime Elite Basketball. He thinks pickleball has significant growth potential as well, he said.  ""We're always looking at content and making sure our offerings on Prime Video reflect our customers' interests,"" he said.  For pickleball enthusiasts, seeing their sport on the small screen, along with the ability to stream games, is welcome news. But patchwork and evolving media strategy has also made it confusing where to watch.  The PPA Tour's 20-plus tournaments in 2023 can be seen across a variety of platforms that also includes ABC, Fox, CBS, YouTube, the Tennis Channel and FanDuel. Earlier this month, the PPA Tour announced that ESPN will cover eight of the league's tournaments.  ""Where pickleball is today, it's a sport that's really hot,"" said Pardoe. ""It's really exciting and nobody wants to miss out on it. But also, no one's really ready to commit to the whole thing as well.""  Pardoe said it will take time to get a more concise and consistent media deal, but today the league is focused on getting its brand ""anywhere and everywhere.""  Pickleball continues to see rapid growth, with an estimated 36 million people picking up a paddle between August 2021 and August 2022, according to a report by the Association of Pickleball Professionals. The sport grew more than 158% over the past three years, according to the 2023 Sports Fitness Industry Association Topline Participation Report."

My Hero The Homewrecker opens with a neo-classical violin intro that sets the scene, leading the way for crushing guitars and pounding drums to compliment the song’s distinctive feel.  Walter Webb has the falsetto and effortless cool of Muse’s Matt Bellamy and a bass-playing style akin to the English band’s bassist Chris Wolstenholme.

Recently, astronomers utilised this telescope's cutting-edge technology to observe a distant star-forming galaxy, delving into its intricate structure with unprecedented detail.  Discovery of the Galaxy  Harnessing the capabilities of NASA's billion-dollar observatory, the James Webb Space Telescope's Orbiter Spacecraft has unveiled the stellar composition of GN20, one of the earliest-known galaxies in the universe. Situated a staggering 12 billion light years away, this captivating discovery represents a luminous and dust-laden star-forming galaxy of extraordinary brilliance.  Significance of the Galaxy  What makes GN20 particularly intriguing is its relatively recent formation, occurring a mere 1.5 billion years after the cataclysmic event known as the Big Bang. Positioned within a region of space referred to as a protocluster or galaxy overdensity, this area holds astronomers' fascination due to its eventual culmination in the formation of colossal galactic clusters.  Insights into the Galaxy's Structure  The captivating image captured by the James Webb Space Telescope allows us to peer back in time when the universe was a mere 1.5 billion years old, as it stands at approximately 13.5 million years presently. Astonishingly, this ancient galaxy boasts a star formation rate approximately 1,860 times greater than the mass of our Sun each year. Astronomers, under the guidance of Luis Colina from the Spanish Astrobiology Centre, employed the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) to examine GN20's structural properties during November 23-24, 2022.  Findings of the Study  Analysis of the MIRI images unveiled a clumpy molecular gas surrounding the galaxy, forming a colossal disk spanning about 46,000 light-years in diameter. Furthermore, the measurements indicated that the galaxy comprises a diffuse gas envelope encompassing a densely packed nucleus of shimmering stars. Remarkably, the nucleus spans a mere 2,600 light-years across, while the gaseous envelope extends approximately 23,000 light-years.  About the James Webb Space Telescope  James Webb Space Telescope stands as NASA's most prominent and powerful space science observatory. Boasting a large infrared telescope with a primary mirror of around 6.5 metres, this state-of-the-art instrument represents a monumental leap forward in our quest to understand the cosmos. It has been positioned a million miles out into space. It orbits the Sun and not the Earth."

OKX is the fifth-ranked exchange, according to CoinMarketCap data with a 24-hour trading volume of $825 million, receiving 2.2 million weekly visitors.  $LHINU will list on the top decentralized exchange (DEX) Uniswap at 2 pm UTC, four hours after the OKX listing.  The top centralized exchange announcement means that Love Hate Inu is launching with maximum impact.  Checkout the OKX $LHINU listing announcement tweet.  Love Hate Inu raised $10,204,000 million in its presale, making it one of the largest crypto fundraises of the year.  Given the meme coin frenzy of the past few weeks, Love Hate Inu could not have picked a better time to launch. While many of those meme coins are already dying, Love Hate Inu has a real business model that guarantees it is here to stay.  How and when to claim $LHINU tokens  Token holders from the presale will be able to claim their coins at 9 am UTC Friday 19th, one hour before the OKX listing takes place.  To claim tokens purchased in the presale, holders simply need to connect on the Love Hate Inu website with the wallet originally used to buy the $LHINU tokens, and then click the ‘claim’ button.  The tokens will appear in the token holder’s wallet.  You can still buy $LHINU before the OKX listing – don’t miss the next Shiba Inu  For those who missed out on Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, or Pepe, this is an exceptional opportunity to capture what could be a staggering return on investment.  Love Hate Inu’s unrivaled utility sets it apart, which explains why it has become one of the hottest meme coins of the year. Crypto analysts predict 10x returns for $LHINU.  Today’s crypto investors don’t just want to chase cute Inu coins with no utility. The best crypto projects, like Love Hate Inu, are taking the utility-led approach.  The team believes that by building a great product, it will attract the users.  As such, Love Hate Inu is creating a system that is scalable so that it can onboard potentially millions of users who will want to vote in its polls.  Love Hate Inu packed with viral utility – the only vote-to-earn meme coin  In sharp contrast to many other meme coins, Love Hate Inu is packed with utility. Its primary use case is to enable community members to hold polls on any manner of subject matter.  Voting is secured by staking the $LHINU token, making the polls immune to manipulation. Voting mechanisms are an ideal use case for blockchain technology.  In addition to providing security, the blockchain’s decentralized network architecture enables voters to be rewarded for their participation through the earning of $LHINU tokens.  Users of the platform can vote on anything in the world they think worthy of a poll, from celebrities and personalities they love or loathe to whatever it is that is of trending interest on the web and beyond.  As can be seen by the examples on the project’s website, meme illustrations have been created of personalities such as Donald Trump, Elon Musk and Andrew Tate, that have viral meme qualities.  The imagery is eminently shareable, helping to achieve viral popularity.  The demo polls that the team has been running support that thesis, with huge interest being shown in the numbers taking part. Tens of thousands have taken part.  Love Hate Inu has hit on a winning formula. Precisely because the internet thrives on controversy and polarization, it means there will always be strong demand on both sides of a divide, as voters vie to get the polling outcome that puts them on the winning side.  Source / $LHINU  Love Hate Inu to transform the survey and polling industry  It is not just individual internet users that the project is targeting. Companies and nonprofits will also want to make use of the voting platform to drive brand engagement and to help organizations to reach their goals.  Again, because of the security of the platform and its ability to verify participants as real people because of the staking mechanism, the team believes the Love Hate Inu service will be particularly attractive to companies who want to conduct surveys.  The platform will also be much more accessible and efficient for companies to use than legacy systems. And Love Hate Inu is working on building a VIP onramp for companies, to encourage adoption.  CEO Carl Dawkin: “We are inserting ourselves into the internet’s big conversations”  Love Hate Inu CEO Carl Dawkins, an adviser to the UK All Party Parliamentary Group on Crypto and Digital Assets , is excited to be able to announce $LHINU’s top exchange listing.  “Everyone here at Love Hate Inu wants to extend a big thank you to everyone in our community that has helped to put our token on the map in such a big way,” said Dawkins.  “It is no accident that OKX is listing $LHINU so early in the Love Hate Inu journey, because they clearly recognize a project with potential to generate growing trading volumes.  “But ultimately Love Hate Inu is about launching a product that has the ability to appeal to a mass market audience. We are creatively inserting ourselves into the big conversations that take place across the internet every day.  For the first time people will be able to use a trusted platform with verifiable data to spin up polls on whatever they choose. Our devs are constructing a system that is superior to anything the likes of Twitter is able to offer. We are bot- and manipulation-free.  “The possibilities for the polling platform are immense. From community governance to consumer marketing, Love Hate Inu will transform the survey and polling industry.”  Basic version coming soon – “Seeing a lot of interest from brands looking at what we are doing”  Dawkins continued: “Love Hate Inu’s killer feature is vote-to-earn. None of the legacy platforms can compete with us on that. Because of that, we are already seeing a lot of interest from brands looking at what we are doing.  “You may have spotted that we are teaming up with $SPONGE, where we are taking part in their airdrop, and Web3 games platform Tamadoge that I was previously involved with – but we are also working with Web2 firms interested in using our service.  “Our platform dashboard development is progressing well. We are even looking at the possibility of getting a basic version of the platform ready at launch, with some votes on there.”  “OKX is the first of many more exchange listings. Love Hate Inu really could be the next Shiba Inu, so hold onto your hats as we rocket to the moon.”  Tune in to the Twitter Spaces AMA with Carl Dawkins  You can hear more from Carl in the Twitter Spaces AMA that took place yesterday, in which 4,200 listeners tuned in.  Including discussion of staking, exchange listings strategy, product launch schedule and much more, Dawkins also laid out some of his thoughts on marketing in response to a question about sustaining the hype.  “We have a lot of marketing we are working on as we keep doing what we’re doing – Love Hate Inu is built for the bull run. We have loads of opportunities. We will see dips but also constant spikes as we keep pushing out.  “Twitter raids, games nights on Discord, other contests, other platform partnerships. TikTok we will start attacking too. Also, every new exchange means more exposure. We have a lot of Asian holders to target. We have so many options to explore.""  Visit LHINU Here"

Hasan is charged with second-degree murder in the death of his ex-girlfriend Melinda Vasilije.  While Hasan has admitted to stabbing Vasilije to death in the spring of 2017, he says she attacked him first, and he blacked out.  Throughout his first four days on the stand, Hasan spoke quietly, with the judge often asking him to speak up.  On Tuesday, Hasan raised his voice and said through tears he did not mean to kill Vasilije - showing intense emotion for the first time since the trial began.  “I should be in jail for a very long time, but I swear to god, I lost control. Convict me for life. I don’t care… but, I blacked out. Don’t try to say I did this in the right mind,” Hasan said, in part.  “I killed her, yes. I didn’t do this out of anger. I didn’t do this because we didn’t get back together. It happened because I was a [..] idiot. It’s all just hitting me.”  Hasan has admitted to stabbing Vasilije 47 times in the early hours of April 28, 2017.  According to Hasan’s previous testimony, after breaking up on April 3, the pair reconciled on the 27.  Security camera footage showed them at Hasan’s vehicle less than an hour before her death.  The footage shows Vasilije going back to her apartment while Hasan walks to his car door.  He then turns around and follows Vasilije back inside.  According to Hasan, once back in her apartment, he admitted to cheating on her during their relationship.  Hasan says at this point she attacked him with a knife. He says he remembers grabbing a knife and stabbing her twice before blacking out.  On cross-examination, Crown attorney Brendan Thomas directed a barrage of questions at Hasan.  “You treated her bad? You cheated on her? You gave her an STI and didn’t tell her? You tried to make her think she was responsible for it? You refused to get treatment? You never told her because you didn’t want to lose the relationship?” Thomas asked.  Hasan answered “yes” to each question.  He was then asked by Thomas: “You were desperate to get her back, you were obsessed, you lied and tried to manipulate her, you said anything to meet with her in person, and you finally got what you wanted?”  He was also asked: “Your one moment of honesty came just before you killed Melinda?”  Court then saw the text Hasan sent Vasilije an hour after her death.  It reads: “Nice seeing you tonight glad we worked things out!! You better have deleted that [..] lol. Anyways see you soon.”  According to Hasan, he sent the message because he thought it might make the police think it wasn't him invovled.  The crown then showed an email sent by Hasan to a Waterloo regional police officer nearly two months after the stabbing  In it, Hasan writes in part: “I’m considering turning myself in, before I do I need you to do something for me. I need you to answer a few questions for me, I know you don’t have to but I will be willing to turn myself in, but I need the answers to these questions first.  He then goes on to say: My first question is, did Melinda ever sleep with anyone else in the course of our relationship (cheat) or not? After we broke up in (sic) April 3 did Melinda ever go on a date between then and April 28? Also did she ever sleep with anyone during the course of that time (sic).”  “If I get the answers I will turn myself in, hopefully before her birthday on June 28.""  The Crown has portrayed Hasan as extremely insecure and obsessed with the idea that Vasilije was cheating on him.  They say this email shows he was still dwelling on it 51 days after he killed her."

Luis “Louie” Ruelas threatened to “f–king bury” people in the explosive trailer for Bravo’s “Teresa Gets Married” special. Bravo  The trailer sees Teresa Giudice breaking down in tears amid her drama with brother Joe Gorga and his wife, Melissa Gorga. Bravo  After breaking down in tears, a woeful Giudice, 50, seems to be talking about her estranged brother when she says, “I just don’t want his name brought up.”  Meanwhile, the “Turning the Tables” author’s eldest daughter, Gia Giudice, suggests that her entire family’s relationship with the Gorgas is all but finished.  “It’s over for everybody — including me and my sisters,” Gia, 22, says in a confessional.  The Gorgas skipped the Aug. 6, 2022, nuptials. Charles Sykes/Bravo  The drama between Teresa and the Gorgas hit its apex in the summer of 2022 after the “Real Housewives of New Jersey” OG brought up rumors that Melissa, 44, cheated on Joe, 47, with longtime friend Nick Barrotta.  A source previously told Page Six the Gorgas — who have been married since 2004 and share three children — “laughed off” the claims.  For more Page Six reality TV updates  Melissa — who, with Joe, subsequently decided to skip Teresa and Ruelas’ Aug. 6, 2022 wedding — later said on her “On Display” podcast, “Sometimes when things are too toxic and you try over and over and over again and it just keeps coming back around to the same thing, even if it’s family, you have to let it go.”  Giudice’s drama with the Gorgas hit its apex in the summer of 2022 as production for “The Real Housewives of New Jersey” Season 13 was winding down. melissagorga/Instagram  Teresa’s longtime frenemy Margaret Josephs, who is close with the Gorgas, attended the wedding, but seemingly felt uncomfortable attending — as she notes in the preview.  “All I can think of is we’re all here and Melissa and Joe are not,” she tells co-stars Jackie Goldschneider and Jennifer Fessler.  Despite the volatile turn of events, there are lighthearted moments expected to play out in “Teresa Gets Married.”  Giudice’s four daughters served as bridesmaids. Charles Sykes/Bravo  Giudice’s co-stars Dolores Catania and Jennifer Aydin were also part of the bridal party. Charles Sykes/Bravo  Several of Teresa’s “Real Housewives” friends — including “Dubai” star Chanel Ayan, “Potomac” star Ashley Darby, “New York City” star Dorinda Medley and “Atlanta” star Kenya Moore — make cameos.  “I love a Jersey wedding,” Medley, 58, says at one point.  Teresa’s infamous wedding hair is also highlighted, though her pal and bridesmaid Jennifer Aydin seems uncertain about the elaborate $10,000 style.  “Hair’s supposed to be an accent piece, not the main event,” Aydin, 46, quips in a confessional.  “Teresa Gets Married” premieres Tuesday, May 23, at 8 p.m. ET on Bravo."

The victim called police the next morning. Deputies observed video footage from the night before and saw the suspect cut open the toolbox in the truck bed, Cutting said.  Police are still investigating the incident.  ‘Explosion’ at high school  Sonoma police responded to a reported “explosion” at Sonoma Valley High School on Wednesday, May 10, likely stemming from a pyrotechnic device, Sonoma Police Chief Brandon Cutting said.  As deputies were responding to the incident, a fire alarm went off on another side of campus, but police are unsure if the two incidents were related, Cutting said. No evidence of an explosion was found on site, and no student could be identified.  No damage was reported and the incident is being handled by school officials, Cutting said.  Petty theft  As a Sonoma woman entered Whole Foods on May 10 around 4 p.m., she was confronted by a group of three strangers who worked together to steal her purse, Cutting said.  One of the suspects approached the woman and asked her for directions to Sonoma Valley Hospital while the other two took her purse, which contained credit cards and about $100 in cash, Cutting said. The cards were charged $500 shortly after at a nearby ATM.  Sonoma police believe the group is a part of a known theft ring in the Bay Area which previously stole items from Halem & Co. jewelry store, Cutting said. There are no leads at this point.  Hit and run  On May 13, Sonoma police responded to a reported hit and run on the 19000 block of Robinson Road.  Video footage near the incident showed a driver hit a parked Honda and continue driving. Deputies found the suspect’s unoccupied car near Verano Avenue and Main Street the next day, but were unable to find the driver, Cutting said.  Sonoma police are still searching for the suspect.  DUI  Police responded to a reported hit and run at 7:22 a.m. in the area of First Street West and Spain Street in downtown Sonoma on May 13.  A witness followed the suspect’s Nissan Xterra and called police, who quickly located the driver and conducted a traffic stop, Cutting said.  Deputies determined the 37-year-old Sonoma man was under the influence of alcohol. Deputies conducted a Breathalyzer test that showed the suspect had a BAC of 0.27 — more than three times the legal limit, Cutting said.

St. John Bosco defensive back Jason Mitchell. Mitchell has several schools on his list and plans to take at least five if not more official trips this cycle. It sounds like many of those trips will come after he makes his decision.  We had a chance to catch up with Mitchell last week at the Braves College Showcase and he updated us on where his recruitment is at right now.  “I’m still set to commit Sept. 16 at the Kahuku (Hawaii) game,” Mitchell said. “I plan to take a few official trips in June and then the rest will be during the season.  “I think I’ll be able to take a few in-season before the Kahuku game and then I’ll do a few after that. You only go through this once and I really want to enjoy the recruiting process so I want to try and take as many trips as I can.”  The schools Mitchell mentioned who he’s hoping to visit include LSU, Notre Dame, Oregon, USC, Utah and Washington. He talked about what stands out with each program:  LSU: “LSU likes me as a corner and that’s where I enjoy playing. I’ll play anywhere but I like corner and LSU is one of those schools like Oregon and USC that I would call a childhood favorite. I always liked them growing up, they produce great defensive backs every year and get them drafted. I like their style of play, the SEC is a great conference so I’m excited to visit there on a game weekend.”  Notre Dame: “Notre Dame is on me really heavy and they’re recruiting me as an athlete right now. They feel I can play corner or safety and haven’t specified exactly where they like me, they said they just me and they’ll find a spot once I get there. I know a lot will depend on my frame and how big I get but I see a lot of opportunity at Notre Dame. They have a great staff in place with a great head coach who knows defense really well. I like how they’re recruiting me, and so, I’m excited for my visit and we still need to decide if that will in June or during the season.”  Oregon: “Oregon feels a lot like L.A .(Los Angeles) to me. I don’t mean the city as much as the people there. They have a lot of coaches that are from here and when I talk to them, it feels like home for sure. I love the vibe and the way I feel when I’m with those guys. They’re good coaches and quality people and I’ve always loved the Oregon program a lot.”  USC: “I mean, it’s USC. What else can I say? It’s the school I grew up watching, my dad played there, so I’ve always followed them. It’s a childhood favorite, but still, I have to pick the best school for me, not just who I liked when I was young. It’s a business decision, but saying that, I do like USC a lot and I’m really close with (defensive backs coach and defensive passing game coordinator) Donte (Williams) and the rest of the staff.”  Utah: “I’m going to visit Utah for sure during the season and the coaches gave me their schedule and I just have to pick a game. I love that staff and they show a lot of love. I talk with (special teams coordinator and cornerbacks) coach (Sharrieff) Shah, (defensive coordinator and safeties) coach (Morgan) Scalley, (head) coach (Kyle) Whit(tingham), and everyone there is so real and genuine. There’s nothing but great people at Utah and they’re all about development, so I really like them a lot.”  Get the latest football and basketball transfer portal news from 247Sports.

Omaha Gross 5, Beatrice 2  Beatrice got on the board first on an RBI single by pitcher Deagan Nelson, but the Cougars capitalized on a couple of errors to take a 3-1 lead in the second inning. Colby Duncan reached first base on an error that scored Carson Almgren as Duncan collided with the Orangemen first baseman.  Owen Brennan then drove a fly ball to deep right, as Joshua Buhr made a good adjustment in right for the out, but Alex Kosse scored easily from third, and on an error on the throw to home, Duncan also scored.  An RBI single by Colby Duncan provided an insurance run in the top of the sixth.  ""We got some big at-bats,"" Gross head coach Jim Hempel said, after the Cougars followed a 13-run performance with five on Tuesday.  ""One through nine here for these last few games, we've had guys really locked in and they've been having good ABs. We talked about if we don't strike out, we put the ball in play, and hit a few hard, we're gonna win a lot of games because our defense is good and our pitching has been really good this year.""  Starting pitcher Joseph Rempe was pulled after 5.1 innings of one-run ball for Jack Miller with two runners on and one out in the bottom of the inning.  ""We told Joe we had to have him go deep into this game,"" Hempel said. ""He hadn't thrown this whole week, and he went out and gave us everything he had, just gutted it out. (He) gave up that early run and then just settled in which, that's been his career. He's beaten a lot of big teams over the last two years.""  Using a ""very manageable"" curveball, Rempe commanded the zone and put the Cougars in a position for Miller to come in and finish the win.  After getting a strikeout, Miller induced the final out to keep the Cougars lead at 4-1.  An Almgren sacrifice fly added some room to the Gross lead, but the drama didn’t end there in the seventh.  On a play at the plate, Rempe trucked into the Beatrice catcher Noah Jobman after running through third on a single to left, and was tossed from the game, igniting some shouts from both benches but without escalating further.  Rempe will miss the first game but not the second (if necessary) against Elkhorn North tomorrow.  ""Curious to see some video of that. So I wasn't real happy about that. I understand the out call but the ejection I thought was a little questionable with the catcher coming up the line in a split second. You don't have any options. You're gonna have contact in a play like that. So it's unfortunate that we will lose him for the first game.""  Miller shut the door in the bottom of the inning for a second straight Cougars win to earn his school record-tying fourth save of the season.  ""We didn't want anybody else out there other than Joe and then Jack Miller does what Jack does. He tied coach Peters' spring record for saves, and that was his fourth one today, and he's been wanting to get on the big board up at school, so that would be able to get him on. So he's pretty excited about that.""  Omaha Gross next plays Elkhorn North on Wednesday at 10 a.m. back at Fricke Field. A loss to the Wolves would end the season, while a win would set up a win-or-go-home for both teams, the winner advancing to the Class B state championship game on Friday at Tal Anderson Field at 4 p.m.  Om. Gross (17-7) … 030 001 1 – 5 6 0  Beatrice (15-10) ….. 100 000 1 – 1 5 2  Platteview 12, Conc./BT/OCA 1 (6 inn.)  A bases-clearing double and three-run homer by Alex Draper provided the bulk of the offense for the Trojans in their second win of the state tournament to advance to face Malcolm for a second time at Millard North on Wednesday at 4 p.m.  After Draper emptied the bases in the second, Dezmond Straatman drove in two more with a single to right in the third, and the lead ballooned to seven as Draper was hit by pitch with the bases loaded.  Draper was then driven in on a sac fly by Nathan Thomas, and another from Keegan Stobbe scored the Trojans ninth run of the game.  The senior Trojan then effectively hit a walk-off three-run shot to right to earn Platteview a mercy-rule win.  Conc./BT/OCA (11-15) .. 000 001 x – 0 0 1  Platteview (15-11) …….. 133 014 x – 12 13 1"

Here are my two favourites at the moment.  2 growth stocks that might explode in the near future  You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources , and more. Learn More .  Over the last 20 years, growth stocks have handed shareholders some of the best returns that the stock market has to offer.  Take Amazon, for example. A £10,000 stake in 2003 would have surged 10,079% to become over a million at today’s share price.  While that’s hardly typical, it does show what’s possible. And there are two stocks I own that I think have the potential to shoot up in the coming years.  Games Workshop  The first stock I’m excited about is tabletop gaming company Games Workshop (LSE: GW). Its share price has already grown over 20 times from £4.23 to £98.30 inside the last decade.  This growth shows what a good job it’s been doing building its brand. In fact, from 2016 to 2022:  Revenue increased from £118m to £414m  Margins increased from 11% to 31%  Net income increased from £13m to £128m  The total market cap grew to £3.2bn from only £161m  A Henry Cavill TV series  As impressive as all that is, I think it might just be the start here. As what’s really exciting is the potential of its Warhammer intellectual property.  Other fictional worlds like Star Wars, Marvel or Lord of the Rings have had outrageously successful – and lucrative – TV shows and movies.  And only last year, Amazon struck a deal with the firm to create a Warhammer series starring Henry Cavill. If that goes on to have success like those other big franchises, then I’d expect my Games Workshop shares to move much higher.  It’s worth mentioning that the show hasn’t even been filmed yet, so any success is not at all guaranteed.  Tesla  My second choice, electric vehicles (EV) manufacturer Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), needs little introduction.  The carmaker has already grown at a 40% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the last 10 years. That’s thanks to its success in producing desirable EVs, taking a 65% share of that market.  But its success does present an obvious question: is the growth phase already over?  Musk’s latest vision  Personally, I don’t think so. And the reason is its owner Elon Musk has a much grander vision. He wants Tesla to put self-driving vehicles on roads all around the world.  The company that introduces safe and effective autonomous vehicles will surely see huge growth. It’s like creating the same productivity as millions of taxis and lorry drivers in one fell swoop.  And Tesla looks well placed here. First off, the firm’s vertical integration – making its own batteries, having its own repairs, and the like – means the company trounces its competitors when it comes to margins.  Tesla Toyota Honda GM Ford Stellantis 2022 Net Margin 15.5% 6.9% 4.80% 6.20% -1.4% 9.2%  That’s a lot more cash to spend on research and testing its autonomous vehicles.  But also, Musk’s latest move was to slash thousands off the prices of his cars. By doing this, he thinks Tesla can gain further market share to give itself an untouchable advantage in self-driving technology.  For me, the biggest risk here is simply that other investors agree with me. Today’s share price of $172 bumps the price-to-earnings ratio up to an expensive-sounding 50.  But even at that price, I think Tesla can join Games Workshop on my list of stocks that I’m extremely bullish about for their future growth potential."

While the pair returned to screens this week to host This Morning, reports have been circulating that Holly is looking to pull the plug on their TV partnership. On Monday, the stars managed to present the show with a smile, but many viewers spotted tension under the surface. But what are Holly and Phil actually rowing about and when did it begin? READ MORE: Holly and Phil's ‘awkward’ snap highlights backstage 'tension'  Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield returned to This Morning  After first working together back in 2006, Holly and Phillip have been best friends ever since. But despite appearing on the ITV daytime show together, reports surfaced the pair were ""barely speaking"" off camera. According to The Sun, following the ""Queue-gate"" scandal last year, Holly made it clear to ITV bosses that she would continue to host the show even if Phil leaves. It comes after the This Morning hosts faced backlash after thousands of mourners had to wait for up to 24 hours to pay their last respects to Her Majesty amid claims the presenters had skipped the queue.  Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield are close pals  Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield present Dancing On Ice  In a special pre-recorded message at the time, Holly and Phil said they ""would never skip the queue"" and were given special broadcast access. Reports later suggested their friendship had ""cooled off"" in recent months. Last week a source told The Sun that while they are ""putting on smiles"" for the show, there are ""naturally some tensions"". “This has been brewing quietly for some time"", the source told the publication: ""But now it’s all out in the open and people are talking about it. There is no getting past it.""  Holly Willoughby joined This Morning in 2006  Following these reports, Phillip released a statement to the same publication where he referred to Holly as his ""best friend"". It read: “As I have said before, Holly is my rock. We’re the best of friends — as always, she is an incredible support on screen, behind the scenes and on the phone. ""Holly has always been there for me, through thick and thin. And I’ve been there for her. The last few weeks haven’t been easy for either of us.” After Phillip released a statement regarding his friendship with Holly, calling her his ""rock"", sources claimed the mother-of-three was ""blindsided"" by the message which she knew nothing about.

Researching minute occurrences and bringing new insights lie within the prime focus of my task.  Story Highlights Bitcoin price is heavily consolidating within a very narrow range, allowing the other cryptos to intensify their pace and rise high.  Besides, some of the altcoins like Polkadot appear to be preparing for a massive explosion that may raise the levels beyond a 2-digit figure.  The crypto space is maintaining a choppy trend as the prices of the major tokens have been hovering within a very narrow range. Besides, one of the popular altcoins is displaying acute strength as it has been accumulating for the past few weeks. The Polkadot price is currently testing one of the crucial supports and is believed to rebound and reach a 2-digit figure soon.  The Polkadot price, similar to the other tokens within the markets, has maintained a healthy upswing since the beginning of the year. After the remarkable drop, the price is now heading towards the critical levels that may offer a required bounce to rebound and rise above the bearish influence.  DOT price currently appears to be in a group of leaders who are primed to break out from the prolonged downward trend. After a 2-month rise, the Polkadot price surged by nearly 100% and quickly dropped into a deep consolidation for the 3rd month. Therefore, the DOT price cannot continue to fall until it holds the critical levels at $4.83.  Moreover, if Elliot wave analysis is done on the current trade setup, then wave 2 is very close to completion. Therefore, the next wave could be an upward wave that may lift the price towards the upper targets at around $10 to $10.5 initially. However, an extended bullish trend may lift the price close to $12.30."

Insider spoke with three Marines and a Diplomatic Security Service official about closing the post.  They described the rush to leave Sudan, which involved destroying documents and lowering the flag.  Top editors give you the stories you want — delivered right to your inbox each weekday.

Christopher Wolfert watched plumes of smoke rising in the distance amid the booms of exploding mortars and cracks of machine-gun fire in Sudan's capital.  It was Saturday, April 22. The US Marine Security Guard was protecting the American embassy in Khartoum, which had been engulfed by deadly violence for a week at that point. As the situation deteriorated, the Pentagon dispatched Special Operations Forces to evacuate US diplomatic staff in a dramatic helicopter operation. A little under 100 people were rescued from the US embassy compound in just under an hour on the ground.  As Navy SEALs and Army Special Forces rushed in, Sudan's capital was spiraling toward civil war. Tensions between rival powers had finally boiled over, and street fights raged.  ""It was audible and visual,"" Wolfert later said, referring to the fighting nearby. ""The evacuation itself — fairly surreal.""  Wolfert is one of a dozen Marines whose detachment was assigned to guard the US embassy in Africa's third-largest country and one of three Marines that Insider spoke to, along with an official from the Diplomatic Security Service, an agency under the State Department, about the April 22 drawdown and evacuation of America's diplomatic outpost in Sudan.  The men Insider spoke with described scenes of chaos outside the embassy walls and a rush inside to quickly close up shop and get out of Sudan, from destroying sensitive national security information to lowering the American flag. It wasn't what anyone had wanted to see happen.  ""Unfortunately, we really didn't have a choice,"" Staff Sgt. Derek Ferrari, the detachment commander, told Insider. ""When it was time to leave, it was time to leave.""  Smoke is seen in Khartoum, Sudan, Wednesday, April 19, 2023. AP Photo/Marwan Ali, File  Fighting in Sudan first broke out on April 15 when clashes erupted between forces loyal to Gen. Abdel Fattah al Burhan, commander of the Sudanese army, and Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, who leads the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The two have been competing for power ever since they orchestrated a 2021 military coup together.  Within days, violence quickly gripped the country, killing hundreds of people and injuring thousands more. Foreign governments began efforts to pull out their diplomatic staff and, in some cases, also moved to evacuate their civilians.  At one point, armed fighters even opened fire on a clearly marked US embassy convoy that had identification plates and an American flag. No one was hurt, but Secretary of State Antony Blinken slammed the incident as ""reckless"" and ""irresponsible."" By April 20, US forces had been deployed to positions near Sudan in case they had to quickly extract diplomatic staff.  Though there were signs, the Marines didn't know for sure an evacuation was coming, but it's something that they were ready for. It is something they prepare and train for. ""It's not likely to happen,"" Ferrari said. ""But you need to be ready if it does.""  A symbolic moment  Marine Security Guards are a 24-hour presence at US embassies around the world, and their mission is to protect classified information, US government personnel, and the physical facility. At any given diplomatic post, the Marines work under regional security officers (RSOs) from the Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) — the ambassador's security and law enforcement advisors.  The Marine Security Guard Detachment assigned to the US Embassy in Khartoum, Sudan, stand for a photo in front of McMaugh Hall at Marine Corps Embassy Security Group Headquarters, Quantico, Va., on April 24. US Marine Corps courtesy photo  ""We could not do what we do overseas without Marine Security Guards,"" DSS Deputy Assistant Director Thad Osterhout told Insider. Marine Sgt. Nicholas Bonasera said ""they take care of us as we take care of them.""  Security officers train to handle a wide range of scenarios, such as intruders at the embassy, medical issues, and bomb threats, as well as emergency embassy evacuations and shutdowns.  ""There are some things that are out of your control,"" Ferrari said, but this is why they train. When the Marines learned the embassy had to be evacuated, they sprang into action to start shutting it down.  A flag-lowering ceremony takes place at the US embassy in Khartoum before it is evacuated. Gen. David H. Berger via Twitter  One order of business was lowering the American flag. All the Marines who weren't occupied with other security-related jobs at the moment took part in a ceremony that involved lowering the flag and presenting it to the ambassador, John Godfrey.  ""The American flag represents our footprint in that country and everything that the American people are bringing to that country through our diplomatic channels,"" Ferrari said. ""There's symbolism in lowering the flag.""  A flag-lowering ceremony at the US embassy in Khartoum. Gen. David H. Berger via Twitter  Getting people as violence gripped the capital  Before the evacuation could take place, all the diplomatic staff had to be consolidated at the embassy, which is one large compound protected by a wall. But US government personnel were scattered several miles away across Khartoum in a separate main housing compound and several auxiliary compounds.  Osterhout said DSS special agents had to slip outside the embassy and rescue people as fighting raged throughout the city. Sometimes, they had to wait until a safe window opened up so they could move people back to the embassy. In other cases, agents had to make multiple attempts to retrieve people who were staying temporarily at hotels.

AP Photo/Marwan Ali  Consolidating everyone in one location ""was critically important for our Department of Defense partners,"" Osterhout said. ""Had the DOD evacuation force had to go to more than one location in a city under the conditions Khartoum was in, [it] would've both complicated their planning and execution, but it also would've entailed significantly more risk.""  Outside the embassy walls, there was a lot of confusion on the ground, with poor command and control from the top down on behalf of both warring parties. Osterhout said that while the US was ""confident"" the embassy would not be specifically targeted by senior leadership on either side, there was no assurance that local fighters would avoid this.  DSS Deputy Assistant Director Thad Osterhout (far right) and other DSS leadership, alongside interagency partners, closely monitored the departure from Khartoum from the DSS Command Center in Arlington, VA on April 22, 2023 US Department of State photo  Moving about Khartoum meant traveling in a contested environment, one in which an American could easily end up in the wrong place at the wrong time. At least two Americans have been killed since the fighting began.  Osterhout said there were ""significant concerns"" that low-level forces may seize an opportunity to hold up an embassy convoy or try to gain access to a housing compound, rather than the embassy itself. Osterhout said the embassy is a ""very hard target"" because the Marines guarding the facility are a ""very effective deterrent.""  During the evacuation preparations, the Marines had to protect the national security information at the embassy, which meant safeguarding and destroying sensitive equipment and classified information. Doing this meant balancing available manpower because the Marines had to continue guarding the building like they would normally on a round-the-clock basis and also staff various security posts.  Though fighting was happening in the immediate vicinity of the embassy, neither the Sudanese army nor the RSF were intentionally trying to attack the embassy, Ferrari said. Still, there was a lot of indirect fire and ordnance being thrown around in the surrounding areas.  ""You could see and smell and hear everything around you that could at any time ... have been a great threat to the embassy, whether it was intentional or unintentional,"" he added.  Evacuating the embassy  Fighting like this can always threaten air operations, but when President Joe Biden gave the orders to evacuate the embassy in Khartoum, it signaled that Washington was willing to take that risk.  At 9 a.m. EST on April 22, three MH-47 Chinook rotary aircraft took off from Djibouti and stopped to refuel in neighboring Ethiopia before flying another three hours to Khartoum. As is standard practice for diplomatic outposts, the embassy had a pre-designated landing zone in an open field around 500 feet outside the southern entrance to the compound.  Even as the evacuation unfolded, the Marines were constantly busy conducting their standard operating procedures, as they had been since the moment the conflict broke out. They manned the security posts until the very last hour, at which point they had to be shut down.  DSS Deputy Assistant Director Thad Osterhout (far left) and other DSS leadership, alongside interagency partners, closely monitored the departure from Khartoum from the DSS Command Center in Arlington, VA on April 22, 2023. US Department of State photo  Physically moving dozens of personnel from the embassy to the helicopters fell entirely on the responsibility of the more than 100 US troops — all Special Operations Forces — who had flown into Khartoum that day. Once the Marines and diplomatic staff were loaded up onto the helicopters, the mission was complete.  ""The evacuation was conducted in one movement via rotary wing,"" Lt. Gen. D.A. Sims, director of operations for the Joint Staff, told reporters later that day. ""The operation was fast and clean, with service members spending less than an hour on the ground in Khartoum.""  The Marines said that departing Sudan was a ""bittersweet"" moment. There was a sense of sadness to leave behind their Sudanese colleagues and the friends they had made in the country, yet there was also a feeling of satisfaction in knowing that they did their duties.  ""Even though it's seems like we're leaving our diplomatic footprint behind in Sudan, we were leaving with all the personnel that we were supposed to,"" Ferrari noted. ""No one had been killed, no one had been seriously injured, everybody had been evacuated safely. So that is a successful mission as a whole — that is something that no one should be sad or upset about.""  ""Our job is to protect the embassy,"" Wolfert said. ""We had done our jobs well.""  US Mission personnel assigned to the US Embassy in Khartoum, Sudan, embrace each other upon their safe return to the United States at Dulles International Airport, Va., on April 24. US Marine Corps courtesy photo  With the embassy staff gone, questions remained over whether Washington would move to evacuate US citizens, as some other Western nations had been doing. At one point, the State Department and the Pentagon organized a land convoy — with drone support overhead — to bring Americans to a part city along the Red Sea, where they could then travel onward to Saudi Arabia. Naval support had also been moved into the region.  Meanwhile, fighting in Sudan shows no signs of slowing down, and civilians continue to pay the ultimate price. According to United Nations estimates, over 600 people have been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have either become internally displaced or fled the country.  Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organization, warned last week that the violence is crippling the country at an economic and social level.  ""As well as facing shelling and insecurity, people are dealing with dwindling supplies of water, food, medicines, and electricity,"" he said. ""Establishing safe routes for humanitarian aid is critical. But the ultimate solution is peace."""

After years of explosive growth during the pandemic, Home Depot’s revenue during the first quarter fell short of expectations and the company cut its profit and sales outlook for the year, sending shares skidding before the opening bell Tuesday.  It was a rough start to a busy week of retail earnings and the numbers from the nation’s biggest home improvement chain dragged down retails stocks as well as the Dow.  Advertisement  For the three months ended April 30, revenue dropped to $37.26 billion from last year’s $38.91 billion, and it was short of the $38.45 billion projected by analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research.  Sales at stores open at least a year, a key indicator of a retailer’s health, dropped 4.5%, and it dropped 4.6% for stores in the U.S.  Advertisement  “After a three-year period of unprecedented growth for our sector, during which we grew sales by over $47 billion, we expected that fiscal 2023 would be a year of moderation for the home improvement market,” said CEO Ted Decker.  Decker said weak sales were mostly due to lumber deflation and bad weather, particularly in its Western division which had to contend with extreme weather in California.  But the Atlanta company cut its expectations for the year with as shift in spending becomes more clear with the economy slowing and costs rising for builders and homeowners.  The U.S. Federal Reserve has hiked benchmark interest rates 10 consecutive times with hopes of slowing the economy and cooling inflation.  The U.S. economy slowed sharply from January through March, decelerating to just a 1.1% annual pace as higher interest rates hammered the housing market and businesses reduced their inventories. An estimate from the Commerce Department last month showed that the nation’s gross domestic product — the broadest gauge of economic output — weakened after growing 3.2% from July through September and 2.6% from October through December.  Home Depot cautioned in February that it expected profits to slip this year. The chain saw remarkable growth over the past three years, as many people hunkered down at home or were searching for a new home during the pandemic. Americans spent heavily on home renovations and other projects.  With the easing of the pandemic, Americans began to spend on things that had faded in recent years, like dinners out and vacations.  Home Depot earned $3.87 billion, or $3.82 per share, in the quarter. A year earlier it earned $4.23 billion, or $4.09 per share. That was better than the per-share earnings of $3.80 that industry analysts were expecting.  Advertisement  Home Depot Inc. now expects sales and same-store sales to decline between 2% and 5% this year. Several months ago, the company said it expected sales to be flat compared with 2022.  The chain now expects full-year earnings to fall between 7% and 13%, expanding the potential decline from earlier expectations that the retreat would remain solidly in the single-digit percentage range.  Shares dropped more than 3% before the market open on Tuesday."

For context, it was at that time that bands like ESG and Liquid Liquid existed at the forefront of the Disco Punk frontier, mixing No Wave, Disco and Post-Punk sounds to craft an entirely new genre for music. DJ Kool Herc, meanwhile, was building the foundation for breakdancing, and Blondie had just put out Parallel Lines.  In the art scene, Keith Haring had just set up shop in the Lower East Side, while Jean-Michel Basquiat and Al Diaz were tagging Manhattan under their SAMO alter-ego. “It was a mythical time for art and music in the city,” as the brand puts it.  Referencing the era through clothes, YMC is celebrating ’70s New York’s breakthroughs with clashing colors, military surplus references and arty prints. Cotton ripstop, leaf print camouflages and field jackets in soft twill nod to the army-inspired silhouettes of the time, while shirting appears inspired by Basquiat’s legendary works. The color palette, which largely consists of washed blue, black, ecru, red, brown and royal blue, is just as much a sign of the times.  The brand’s signature pieces, like the Bowie shirt, arrive with fresh New York-inspired patterns. The PJ Overshirt is made from a delicate Broaderie Anglais; the Walker Jacket enlists a pre-washed dye, and the Battle Jacket dons a military-inspired brown facade. Clashing colors, as mentioned, appear in stripes on the Bluebird Dress and Rat Pack Cardigan, referencing the “anarchic spirit” that defined the period.  YMC’s Pre-Fall 2023 collection is now available to shop on the brand’s webstore. Revel in the range in the gallery above.

Explosion of a missile is seen in the sky over the city during a Russian missile strike in Kyiv, Ukraine May 16, 2023.  Kyiv was targeted by 18 different missiles in a “pretty intense” attack overnight, according to Ukraine – but officials managed to shoot them all down.  According to the country’s authorities, at least three people were injured in the assault from both drones and missiles.  It came just as Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy concluded his European tour where he was asking Western allies for greater military support against Russia – and received substantial pledges for more funding and equipment.  The first air raid alert went off at 2.30am local time (11.30pm GMT) and only ceased two hours later.  This was the eighth time the capital has been targeted by missiles this month alone, following a 50-day pause on the attacks.  Moscow has increased its attacks against Ukraine in recent weeks while bracing itself for Kyiv’s counteroffensive.  But, this series of missiles was particularly devastating, because Kyiv was attacked from the north, south and east with 18 air, sea and land-based missiles.  Miraculously though, no fatalities have been reported yet.  Still, as the British ambassador to Ukraine, Dame Melinda Simmons, tweeted: “A full on aerial attack on Kyiv last night, pretty intense.  “Bangs and shaking walls are not an easy night. Hope everyone is OK.”  A full on aerial attack on Kyiv last night, pretty intense. Bangs and shaking walls are not an easy night. Hope everyone is ok. — Dame Melinda Simmons (@MelSimmonsFCDO) May 16, 2023  The head of the Ukrainian capital’s military administration, Serhiy Popko, also said the attack was “the maximum number of attack missiles in the shortest period of time”.  But, he said “preliminary information” shows most of these were “destroyed”, leaving rocket debris across the city.  Story continues  Six of the missiles were allegedly Kinzhal hypersonic missiles – those which exceed the speed of sound by five times – which Moscow previously claimed could not be defeated by any air defence system.  Officials think Moscow wants to exhaust Ukraine’s air defence systems through its barrage of attacks.

He has escaped to Odisha, according to information collected by the police. He will not be spared. The police arrested him on October 19 last year and the factory was sealed.

Eyewitnesses said, local residents who gathered at the spot roughed up the inspector-in-charge of Egra police station, Mousam Chakraborty, when he reached the spot alleging that the authorities took no action although six explosions took place in the same factory over the last four years.  “Police are the custodian (of law).

Bengal has become the stockpile of explosives...,” leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari also tweeted.  Speaking on the BJP demand for an NIA probe, Banerjee said she has no objection to the central agency taking over the investigation.“We do not have any objection to the NIA probe if they arrest the real culprit.

Nobody was injured in the blast in 1e Schansstraat, in the Delfshaven neighbourhood, at around 4am on Tuesday. Police said the residents were not home at the time.  The city’s mayor, Ahmed Aboutaleb, has blamed drugs gangs for the escalating violence, claiming that the success of authorities in intercepting narcotics shipments has triggered a wave of between against rival groups and their families.  The national police force is setting up a specialist team to gather information about the attacks. “We will analyse all incidents: what kind of area are they taking place in, what explosives or weapons are used? Not just at national level, but also in a European context.”  Police are also stepping up their presence in areas where the violence has been concentrated, such as Crooswijkseweg and Van Speykstraat.  Ingrid Coenradie, councillor for local party Leefbaar Rotterdam, said the community also had a role to play in making their neighbourhood safer. Police have arrested a number of suspects in recent weeks, including two teenage boys who were caught in the act of placing a firebomb.  “Parents, neighbours and relatives need to talk more to the council and the police, because there are plenty of people who know that youths are hanging out on the streets at night,” she said. “Look at each other and ask: ‘why weren’t you home last night?'”"

At the time, gold was enjoying a parabolic rally, and the discussion amongst the general public was how far past the $2,000 mark gold was going to strike during that rally.  So, on Aug. 11, 2011, I concluded my first gold article on Seeking Alpha as follows:  ""Again, since we are most probably in the final stages of this parabolic fifth wave ""blow-off-top,"" I would seriously consider anything approaching the $1,915 level to be a potential target for a top at this time.""  Needless to say, my first market prognostication was not met with tremendous support. These are a sample of the comments I received from Seeking Alpha readers when I was calling for a metals market top:  ""With all due respect Avi, you plainly do NOT understand the gold market."" ""Your TA is useless. You don't understand the fundamentals because you only look to the past. Gold bulls are forward thinking. The times they are a changing..."" ""The problem is that TA is like driving a car by only looking in the rear view mirror... There is no foresight involved; it's all based on past performance. The future of the fundamentals is what you fail to grasp."" ""There is no way you can understand what is going on in gold by doing technical analysis. Gold is driven by fundamentals."" ""Technical analyses is all well and good, but you cannot apply it to the PM sector which has been artificially manipulated and suppressed for years.""  Yet, as we now know, gold struck a top within $6 of the top for which I was calling.  What many may have seen as either ignorance or hubris, I even provided my downside target even before gold topped, wherein I explained my expectation for gold to drop back down to the $1,000 region.  ""Based upon the Elliott Wave Principle, I would expect a very large pullback. In fact, the target for such a pullback will probably be a minimum low of $1,400, it could fall as low as $1,000, or even as low as $700. It will depend upon how the decline takes form. But those are very viable targets for gold on the downside.""  And, the comments regarding my views were basically the same as above, so, I will just note one of the more ""reasonable"" comments:  ""There is no way to rationalize $700 gold with 50% debasement of currency expected over the next 5 years as US debt grows to $21 trillion from $14. It makes no sense to my feeble mind. I vote for $3000 vs. $1900 today. That makes sense to my mind.""  As you can see, it was quite clear at the time that the ""fundamentals"" were keeping most metals bulls looking to the long side. And, amazingly, those same fundamentals kept the metals bulls looking to the long side of the market during the entire decline.  ElliottWaveTrader.net  But what was truly amazing was that as gold was approaching its long-term low struck at the end of 2015, almost the entire market turned bearish and was again ""certain"" that it would continue in its downside trajectory (just as strongly as they were certain we would eclipse $2,000 in 2011), with most now turning from bullish to predicting a drop below $1,000.  Well, just like everyone was uber-bullish at the highs when we expected a major top, we turned bullish when everyone turned uber-bearish. On Dec. 30, 2015, I urged investors to be moving back into the metals complex as we were looking for a long-term bottom to be struck imminently due to the significant bearishness evident in the market:  ""As we move into 2016, I believe there is a greater than 80% probability that we finally see a long-term bottom formed in the metals and miners and the long term bull market resumes. Those who followed our advice in 2011, and moved out of this market for the correction we expected, are now moving back into this market as we approach the long term bottom. In 2011, before gold even topped, we set our ideal target for this correction in the $700-$1,000 region in gold. We are now reaching our ideal target region, and the pattern we have developed over the last four years is just about complete... For those interested in my advice, I would highly suggest you start moving back into this market with your long term money...""  In fact, back in September 2015, and when the metals mining companies were absolutely hated by the investor community, I rolled out a service on ElliottWaveTrader specifically to focus on the mining industry. We began urging our clients to buy mining stocks during the last quarter of 2015. In fact, I bought stocks such as Newmont Mining (NEM) in the $15-17 region at the time. And, NEM was my largest holding in the complex since that time.  Now, fast-forward to 2022, and gold had been stuck in a correction since a local top was struck back in August 2020. Yet, there were pockets within the market which still rallied into 2022.  An example of such outperformance in 2022 included NEM, which went on to strike higher highs in April 2022. Yet, when NEM struck the 84-85 region, I outlined to the members of The Market Pinball Wizard that, for the first time since I bought NEM in 2015, I was selling almost my entire holdings in the company. You see, I set a target of 82-89 when NEM was hovering in the 28 region. And, when we moved into my target region, I stuck with my plan and sold my largest holding in the complex. Since that time, NEM dropped 57% off its highs.  So, back in January, I provided my latest assessment of the gold market, with an expectation for gold to rally to the $2,428 region in this current move off the early November low. I also noted that we can certainly even blow through that, depending upon the extensions we see in the upcoming rally, but that target was a solid one for now. Clearly, I will reassess the target once the next bullish phase begins in earnest.  And, then in April, I outlined my expectation for the metals market to begin its next rally to the $2,200-plus region. My expectation was that a break-out through $2,075 would trigger that next bigger move. Yet, while the market spiked to $2,085 in early May, I warned members of The Market Pinball Wizard that the structure of that move did not look like it was starting that rally to $2,200 just yet, and I expected more of a pullback. So, while the market did spike through $2,075, it clearly was not able to sustain that rally, as we expected, and it immediately spiked back down below.  At this time, I'm still expecting a fast and strong rally to $2,200-plus in the coming months. And a break-out over $2,085 will likely now be the trigger.  But silver is providing to us a relatively low risk buying opportunity as it's setting up to see a very strong upside follow through when this pullback completes.

As long as silver holds over $22.50, I'm expecting this pullback to complete over the coming week or two and set us up for a strong rally which should be pointing us north of 27 rather quickly.

Pix:Twitter  International concerns about Nigeria’s high fertility rate calls for a deeper reflection on our national demography and its implications. Clearly, Nigeria’s bourgeoning young population is a potential national asset and the envy of the developed nations.  But without a clear-cut plan for their general well-being, especially quality education and job opportunities, the future is bleak and a reason to rue high fertility.  Globally, population is one of those indices through which nations are measured for their strength or the lack of it. Population strength is as potent as the economic power of a country, its political influence and military might in the comity of nations. And closely tied to population is the average fertility rate that obtains from one country to the other.  Given the significance, a recent global ranking placed Nigeria as the 8th most fertile country in the world, and in an odd category crowded by fellow African countries. Notably, Nigeria and the likes have continued to increase global population at a time the world is slowing down and has recorded a 50 per cent drop in fertility. According to the report published by Daily Mail UK, the global average number of children born to each woman is now 2.3, compared to 4.7 in 1970.  While swathes of Europe and North America are recording less than two births per woman on the average, Africa is leading with Somalia (6.4), Chad (6.4), The Democratic Republic of the Congo (6.2), Mali (6.0), the Central African Republic (6.0), Angola (5.4), Nigeria (5.3), Burundi (5.2) and Benin (5.1). The case of Nigeria already stands out for analysts, given the estimated population (without an actual headcount though) in excess of 206 million people – and the seventh most populous country in the world.  Indeed, the debate on values of a large population is not new. In fact, there are two broad schools of thought regarding population and development. Population might be a demographic dividend or a demographic disaster. That is, it could be a great economic, political and social asset, if well harnessed. Otherwise, it is a liability and time bomb of incalculable destruction waiting to happen.  The Malthusian argument of finite resources already forewarned the negative impact of overpopulation, which includes high-level unemployment, hunger, food crisis, and crime rates – and other social ills that are now self-evident in Nigeria and part of the African continent. Again, an unwieldy and poorly managed population increases the number of out-of-school children, which the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) already pegs at 18.5 million in Nigeria alone.  In addition, is fiery competition for scarce resources and seething social tension, coupled with poor access to healthcare, education and general sense of despondency. Not far-fetched in that setting is overcrowding, depletion of natural resources, and environmental degradation.  Population, vis-à-vis available resources, already places Nigeria in a dire strait. Hence, the need to be wary of unbridled population spikes. Because the socio-political and economic structures prevalent in a society are usually the deciding factor of population policy, concerned stakeholders have consistently said that the very low level of Nigeria’s utilisation of available resources has set the country up for minimal population growth rate – if it must avert disaster.  So, population growth must slow down until Nigeria gets the socioeconomic parameters right. Therefore, at present, the political office holders need to stabilise the political economy, come up and enforce a policy that will keep the population within manageable limits; not discounting civic education to show down the birth rate.  On the flip side of the narrative, however, the population positivists argue that a large demography is not the problem per se, but for the poor management of its potential. They argued that declining fertility rates could lead to a stagnant population, which is crippling many advanced economies and overwhelming public support systems.  Currently, falling fertility rates mean nearly every country could have shrinking populations by the end of the century. No fewer than 23 nations – including Spain and Japan – are expected to see their populations halve by 2100. Researchers at the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation also showed the global fertility rate nearly halved to 2.4 in 2017 – and their study projects it will fall below 1.7 by the turn of this century. The implication is that countries will also age dramatically, with as many people turning 80 as there are being born.  On the contrary, Nigeria’s rapidly growing population is giving life to the baby food market and industries. According to a research firm, the Nigerian baby food market has a promising future and is expected to reach over N200 billion by 2023 on the back of high birth rate and fertility rate. While the multinational companies (MNCs) are already enjoying steady patronage from the Nigerian baby food market, the market remains an untapped opportunity for Nigerians.  "

The mine operator, Massey Energy, was found at fault for the tragedy.. By Danielle Letenyei May 16 2023, Updated 4:23 p.m. ET  Over 21,000 coal miners in West Virginia have lost their lives on the job since the 1880s. One recent fatal mine accident in the state was the Upper Big Branch Mine disaster in 2010, which claimed the lives of 29 coal miners.  Article continues below advertisement  On April 5, 2023, the 13th anniversary of the UBB tragedy, West Virginia lawmakers and residents held a memorial to honor those who died in the mine explosion. They also announced plans to build a Miners Memorial Wall in Beckley, W.Va., in honor of the UBB victims and all other miners who have died on the job in the state.  Source: Getty Images  Article continues below advertisement  What happened at the Upper Big Branch Mine disaster?  The Upper Big Branch Mine disaster is known as the second deadliest coal mine disaster in the U.S. It happened on April 5, 2010, at the Upper Branch Montcoal Eagle Mine, about 30 miles south of the West Virginia state capital of Charleston.  At 3:27 p.m. that afternoon, miners were working 1,000 feet underground when a massive explosion rocked the mine. It was later determined that the blast was caused by a build-up of methane gas and coal dust, the U.S. Department of Labor’s Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) reported.  Article continues below advertisement  Initially, 25 miners were killed, and four were missing after the blast. The four missing were found dead in the mine four days later. 28 of the dead were employees of Massey Energy, the company that owned the mine, and one miner was a contractor, The New York Times reported in 2010.  Source: Getty Images  Article continues below advertisement  Did anyone survive the Upper Big Branch Mine explosion?  Nine miners survived the UBB mine disaster. Survivor Stanely Stewart, who was 300 to 400 feet underground when the explosion happened, told ABC News that he struggled through “hurricane-force” winds and flying debris to get out of the mine.  Survivor James Woods was one of nine miners traveling in an underground vehicle on their way out of the mine at the time of the explosion. The blast killed seven of those in the vehicle, and Woods was pulled out of the mine barely alive, the Associated Press reported. Woods’s son, Jeremy, also worked in the mine and survived the blast.  Article continues below advertisement  Another miner who survived wasn’t as lucky. He lost his son, brother, and nephew in the blast, ABC News reported.  Who was at fault for the Upper Big Branch Mine disaster?  Massey Energy, the company that owned the Upper Big Branch Mine, was found primarily at fault for the explosion. A year after the tragedy, an independent investigation panel appointed by Governor Earl Ray Tomblin, who was governor of West Virginia at the time, found that the blast was “man-made and could have been prevented had Massey Energy followed basic, well-tested, and historically proven safety procedures.”  Article continues below advertisement  Source: Getty Images Performance Coal Company, a subsidiary of Massey Energy, operated the UBB mine.  The MSHA conducted its own investigation into the cause of the UBB explosion and fined Massey $10.8 million, stating that Massey’s corporate culture was “the root cause of the tragedy.” It was the largest fine in the agency’s history.  Article continues below advertisement  But investigators with the Governor’s panel also faulted MSHA for failing to enforce laws and regulations on Massey’s operations of its mines, including UBB.

I am no longer ashamed,” Josie Concepcion said years after the traumatic event of her life.  Josie and her granddaughter in front of her sari-sari store in Lutayan, Sultan Kudarat. Photo: B. Sultan/ICRC  Josie, alongside her son, was one of the victims of a massive explosion near a market in Sultan Kudarat 15 years ago, according to a report released by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).  Luckily, her son was safe with a minor injury. But for her, life went straight downhill.  She went through multiple surgeries to recover her left leg which was badly fractured because of the explosion.  Healthcare professionals noticed that her legs were not of the same length anymore, which explained why she had a hard time walking.  She was given crutches by a volunteer of the Philippine Red Cross she met during that time.  Josie did not just struggle physically but also emotionally and mentally, the ICRC noted. As years passed, she felt like a burden and a useless mother to her family. When she attends Mass or walks outside, people would look at her with derision.  People would mock her saying, “Here comes the cripple.” Josie said it pains her to hear those words.  “I wanted to escape. I wanted to end my suffering. But in a fleeting moment, I thought of my family. ‘What will happen to my children? My husband?’” she was quoted in the ICRC report.  With all those struggles she faced, her husband was her biggest supporter. She felt love and kept going with her life despite all the mockery and gossip she hears.  In 2018, a social worker mentioned that the Davao Jubilee Foundation (DJF) has a program that helps people who were victims of armed conflict.  Josie in front of her newly constructed store. Photo: I. Ali/ICRC  The DJF program strives to make a positive impact on the lives of people affected by armed conflicts. Through this initiative, individuals in need receive specially crafted devices designed to enhance their mobility and independence. The ICRC supports the DJF’s physical rehabilitation services as well as donations for food and transportation for the beneficiaries.  Josie was told that she would no longer have to use crutches if she uses an orthoprosthesis. She was uncertain about that suggestion but she gave it a try and visited the DJF’s office.  After being fitted and learning how to walk with the orthoprosthesis, Josie’s life slowly came back to what it used to be.  The orthoprosthesis, according to the ICRC, serves as an attachment to Josie’s shorter leg, giving her equal footing with the good leg. This secures her balance with both feet planted on the ground, eliminating the need for crutches and ultimately enabling Josie to do the things she loves with ease.  Years after bearing with all the discrimination and mockery of other people, her wish to walk the way she walked before came true. With the help of DJF and ICRC, she is ready to face the world more confidently without thinking about what people might say about her. She is thankful for the support given to her.  Josie now owns a small sari-sari store which she started through ICRC’s micro economic initiatives project—providing productive grants to affected Mindanawons to start or revive their own business.  Now, her only wish is to walk up the stage and proudly hang a medal on her son without the crutches she’s been using for the past years.  “I have nothing to leave to them but their education. I encouraged my son, who is a consistent honor student, to keep up his good work. It is my dream to go up on stage for his graduation. Before, every time he received an award, I refused to go on stage because of my crutches. Now, I want to go on stage without it,” she said. (Zaki Sarmiento / MindaNews)"

Essex Police received a report that a previous occupant, who had been evicted, was allegedly trying to gain access to their old property in Southend on July 22 2021.  The man was known to police on duty, as he had been released from prison that morning after receiving a custodial sentence for assaulting a police officer.  They were aware the individual had been evicted while in prison, and therefore should not be able to access the property.  READ MORE: Three people taken to hospital after crash involving four vehicles on A127  For this reason, PC Sam Hilbery, PC Joe Farrow and two other colleagues all attended.  PC Hilbery and PC Farrow arrived and were informed the suspect might be in a nearby van. As they approached the van, PC Farrow tried to open the back door while PC Hilbery looked through the window.  Suddenly the van exploded, causing PC Hilbery to be thrown back by the blast. She sustained severe burns and had glass embedded in her face and upper torso.  PC Farrow moved PC Hilbery away from further danger and provided initial first aid.  Colleagues started looking for the suspect, with all available units at Southend Police Station making their way to the scene.  He was located within the vehicle and officers got him out to a place of safety, before placing him under arrest.  PC Farrow made surrounding occupants aware of the situation, activating his vehicle siren and lights to draw people's attention, before directing them to a safe place.  Three other officers, including Sgt Katy Major, arrived within minutes and helped him evacuate the whole street.  Sgt Major took control of the scene and ensured roadblocks were put in once the area was cleared.  PC Hilbery was being tended to by PC Steve Martin and PC Garry Neal.  They stripped off her burned clothing and poured water over her to reduce the burns.  Story continues  Sgt Major directed the rest of her team to bang on doors to get more water, for both PC Hilbery and for the suspect, who was also injured and receiving first aid.  Paramedics arrived, took over first aid and conveyed PC Hilbery to the hospital. The paramedics praised the officers on scene, whose quick actions ""undoubtedly"" lessened the severity of PC Hilbery’s burns.  PC Martin said: “We heard officers going to an incident which didn’t seem overly serious… And then the next thing we heard was an emergency call… over the radio, all you could make out was there’d been an explosion and someone was hurt.  “On that particular scene, because I knew that a police officer had been hurt, there’s a lot of confusion, people are quite upset with what’s going on, and then when you’re seeing a colleague being brought towards you, clearly in pain, it’s a bit of a cliché but the training did take over in terms of the medical treatment we gave her.  “It’s good to see that the training we had meant that we could minimise any injuries to Sam and that she remains a police officer doing the job for the people of Essex.”  The suspect went to court but was found not guilty of any offences.  Essex Police Federation Chair Laura Heggie said: “All of the officers who attended this incident showed great professionalism and initiative, in what was a very traumatic and stressful situation. Together they were able to detain the suspect, secure the scene, protect the public, and ensure that PC Hilbery was given the best care possible.  “Seeing a colleague in pain is a distressing experience for everyone, but these officers were able to remain calm and composed. They should all be very proud of their brave and exemplary actions.”  The officers will attend the Essex Police Federation Bravery Awards on Thursday (May 18).  At the event a winner will be announced who will travel to London for the National Police Federation Bravery Awards in July."

Owners will receive notification of the recall beginning June 26, 2023, according to the recall notice. Licensed GM dealers will provide complimentary replacement of the front driver’s side airbag module with a new inflator.  For more information, owners can contact Buick customer service at 1-800-521-7300, Chevrolet customer service at 1-800-222-1020, or GMC customer service at 1-800-462-8782 and reference GM’s recall number N232404980.  ARC Automotive Inflator Recall Requested by NHTSA  Officials have called for ARC Automotive to issue a recall for approximately 67 million air bag inflators, following reports of the air bags exploding, sending sharp metal fragments and debris at the vehicle’s occupants. They provided detailed reports of the airbags rupturing and causing injuries to consumers in the airbag recall request to ARC.  NHTSA officials have been independently investigating the safety of airbags manufactured by ARC Automotive since August of 2016, after receiving multiple reports of consumers sustaining severe injuries to their head, face, and legs, as well as at least one fatality that resulted from a ruptured airbag.  After initiating an investigating into the exploding airbags, the agency concluded that a defect in the manufacturing process of the airbag inflators contributed to a blockage of the inflator. The blockage, which occurred as a byproduct of welding during manufacturing of the inflator, can cause over pressurization, which can then overinflate and rupture the airbag, resulting in an explosion of metal debris into the vehicle’s passenger compartment.  ARC Automotive maintains that a defect is not present in their airbag inflators. Despite the potentially significant and unreasonable safety risks the inflators pose to consumers, ARC has not cooperated with the agency in issuing a safety recall, which has prompted several automobile manufacturers to issue recalls of their own, impacting thousands of vehicles.  To date, General Motors has now issued five separate recalls since 2018, affecting model year 2010 through 2011 Chevrolet Malibu vehicles, model year 2008 through 2017 Buick Enclave, GMC Acadia, and Chevrolet Traverse vehicles equipped with airbag inflators manufactured by ARC.  In addition, BMW issued a recall in 2017 of their model year 2017 X5 sDrive35i, X5 xDrive35i, X5 xDrive50i, X5 xDrive35d, and X5 xDrive40e vehicles, Ford issued a recall in 2017 of their model year Mustang and F-150 pickup vehicles, while Volkswagen also issued a recall in 2022 of various model year 2016 Volkswagen and Audi vehicles.  The NHTSA says it may take other appropriate action against ARC if they continue to decline initiating a voluntary recall. The agency has indicated that if an ARC recall is not issued, the airbag inflator manufacturer must provide a detailed explanation on why they believe the product is safe, along with data supporting their analysis.  Takata Airbag Recall Still Affecting the U.S. Auto Industry  These latest airbag problems comes while the U.S. auto industry continues to replace defective Takata airbags, which were also found to explode and project metal debris onto vehicle occupants due to a defect in the airbags design. At least 28 deaths and more than 400 injuries have resulted from the defective Takata airbag inflators.  More than 100 million Takata airbags have been recalled worldwide since 2014, impacting tens of millions of vehicles from more than 20 automobile manufacturers. Officials identified that the chemical nitrate was used to inflate the air bags, which can break down from exposure to heat or humidity, resulting in the explosion of metal fragments and debris.  The series of Takata airbag recalls has been considered the largest and one of the most complex series of recalls ever recorded in U.S. history. However, if approximately 67 million ARC Automotive airbags are recalled in the coming weeks, the auto industry could be plagued for years bv the need to repair and replace the recalled airbags, in addition to the risk of potential product liability lawsuits."

By Tuesday afternoon firefighters had turned the building at 716 Oregon Ave. back over to the Spokane-based OXARC company, said Ben Shearer, the Pasco Fire Department public information officer.  Firefighters were called shortly before 10:20 a.m. for an explosion in a metal building where acetylene is manufactured. The production building contained only acetylene containers and the machine that makes it.  Acetylene is a flammable gas used in welding and doesn’t produce much smoke when it burns. It’s kept in canisters under pressure, and it can explode when exposed to high heat.  It’s not clear what sparked the fire.  One employee was working in the area when the explosion happened but was able to escape unharmed.  OXARC employees were evaluated by Pasco medics at the scene and one employee was taken to a local medical center to be checked further, said Shearer.  Much of the time battling the blaze was spent planning an approach to extinguish several burning containers of acetylene but not put fire crews at risk.  “The fire was complicated from the aspect that OXARC is a large supplier of many different gas products, some that do not care if they get wet and some react violently if they get wet,” Shearer said in a news release.  They worked with OXARC employees to determine where the acetylene was being stored and making sure the machinery that produced it was shut off.  Firefighters on the scene focused on making sure the heat and fire didn’t spread to other buildings.  “Once we knew what we were dealing with, everything went very quickly and efficiently,” Shearer said.  Shearer didn’t know how extensive the damage was to the building, but the business is shut down at the moment.  OXARC provides welding and industrial supplies and safety products and training from its 21 locations across the Northwest.  While there was some initial concerns about the smoke and acetylene in the air moving through East Pasco, Shearer said the gas had dissipated quickly. He said they are not aware of any public health issues.  Story continues  There also wasn’t any chemical spills. Shearer said firefighters prevented water from going into the storm drains.  An explosion forced people to flee from OXARC Tuesday morning. Firefighters have closed Oregon Avenue to battle the blaze.  Oregon Avenue has opened after being shut between East A Street and East Lewis Street. It also sparked a brief lockdown at some nearby schools as a precaution.  The warm temperatures meant firefighters were being rotated in and out at the scene and then able to rest in a cooling area.  In all, 34 fire units helped at the fire, including crews from Pasco, Richland, Kennewick, Franklin County Fire District 3, Walla Walla Fire District 5, Benton County Fire districts 1 and 4, West Benton Fire Rescue and from the police and utility crews from Pasco and Franklin Emergency Management."

Example video title will go here for this video  BUFFALO, N.Y. — National Grid tells 2 On Your Side there were four manhole explosions on Saturday night on Edward Street, near Main and Goodell.  City officials say an initial investigation shows an underground electric cable likely caught fire and caused the chain of explosions.  National Grid workers also told 2 On Your Side they were replacing a cable carrying 25,000 volts.  2 On Your Side is told the cables are around 100 years old and the city has been replacing some of them around town prior to the manhole explosions along Edward Street.  Despite this, National Grid officials say it's under investigation and they're still determining a cause.  As of Tuesday night, four of five commercial buildings that lost power now have it back.  That's except for the Cyclorama Building on Franklin and Edward.  David Bertola -- a spokesperson for National Grid -- says there was a small fire in the building and they are investigating whether the explosions caused it.  Power will be restored there once an inspection is completed.  There were no injuries from the explosions.  However, this is not the first time there's been a manhole explosion in the city.  2 On Your Side asked Bertola if the company plans to take any steps to prevent future explosions.  ""We're always assessing and looking at the frequency of these kinds of things and so I'm sure that will be looked at. We're in the middle of an investigation into what caused the incident. So that may be part of the conversation as well,"" Bertola said.  ""We don't know the cause of Saturday's incident but a manhole cover can dislodge when a spark from underground wiring ignites gas when the manhole. Dislodged manholes aren't common in underground networks like those in the City of Buffalo.""  A spokesman for the city says Edward Street could open back up as soon as late Wednesday or Thursday."

(Image credit: UiT/AKMA3)  Ocean explorers in the Arctic have discovered an underwater volcano spewing mud and methane from inside another, larger crater that probably formed after a catastrophic blowout at the end of the last ice age.  Researchers spotted the unusual feature about 80 miles (130 kilometers) south of Norway's Bear Island, or Bjørnøya, in the Barents Sea. The volcano, which the team named the Borealis Mud Volcano, is only the second of its kind discovered in Norwegian waters.  ""Exploring the seabed and discovering new methane [seeps] is like finding hidden treasures,"" said Stefan Buenz (opens in new tab), a professor at The Arctic University of Norway (University of Tromsø) and co-leader of the Advancing Knowledge of Methane in the Arctic (AKMA) expedition that made the discovery. ""Every time we go down to the seabed, we get the feeling that we have just begun to understand the great and incredible diversity of such [seep] systems,"" Buenz said in a translated statement (opens in new tab).  A submarine mud volcano is a geological structure formed by an expulsion of muddy fluid and gas, predominantly methane.  The Borealis Mud Volcano measures roughly 23 feet (7 meters) in diameter and is about 8 feet (2.5 m) tall. On May 7, the scientists used a remote-controlled rover to capture footage of the small mount continuously emitting a muddy fluid, which the researchers say is rich in methane. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas once it reaches the atmosphere and contributes to climate change .  Related: 'Mind boggling' array of 19,000 undersea volcanoes discovered with high-resolution radar satellites  The volcano sits in the middle of another, much larger crater, which is 984 feet (300 m) wide and 82 feet (25 m) deep. The exceptional formation sits 1,312 feet (400 m) below the sea surface and likely resulted from a sudden and massive methane eruption after the last glacial period, 18,000 years ago, according to the statement.  ""Seeing an underwater eruption in real time reminds me how 'alive' our planet is,"" Giuliana Panieri (opens in new tab), a professor in geology at The Arctic University of Norway and the leader of the expedition, said in the statement.  The researchers found the volcano's flanks teeming with animal life feeding off carbonate crusts — mineral crusts formed when microorganisms consume methane and produce bicarbonate as a byproduct, according to a 2019 study in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health (opens in new tab) — that formed thousands of years ago. They spied sea anemones, sponges, corals, starfish, sea spiders and diverse crustaceans.  The only other known mud volcano in Norwegian waters is the Håkon Mosby volcano. This 0.6-mile-wide (1 km) feature was discovered 4,100 feet (1,250 m) below the water’s surface on the seabed south of Svalbard in 1995, according to the University of Bergen's Center for Geobiology (opens in new tab). Underwater mud volcanoes are difficult to spot and map, but researchers estimate there could be hundreds or thousands of them on the seafloor globally, according to a 2021 chapter in Lecture Notes in Earth System Sciences (opens in new tab).  These volcanoes provide a rare window into geological processes occurring deep below Earth's crust, since they spout mainly water, minerals and fine sediment from these depths. They also offer clues about previous environments and conditions on Earth, and could give an insight into systems on other planets, Panieri said."

According to a fire investigation report released to 9NEWS Wednesday, the smoke was caused by an electrical arc that started a fire in a conduit underneath a sidewalk. Burning PVC pipe let off gases including hydrogen, which collected in the electrical room, where static electricity sparked the explosion.  ""It was just a loud combustion in my ears,"" said Ash Fox, a former tenant who witnessed the explosion. ""It was a mess for sure.""  In the days following, 300 to 400 people were forced to find new places to live. Some reported robbers had broken into their apartments in their absence and stolen their belongings.

More than two dozen people were injured after an explosion in Tijuana, Mexico, a few miles south of the San Ysidro Port of Entry Tuesday morning, prompting a large response from rescuers from various local agencies.  A boom shook the Blancas building in Tijuana's East Zone at around 9:35 a.m. The building houses a print shop, a furniture store, a car detailing shop and a spare parts store. Atop the businesses were apartments that were not meant to be inhabited, according to the Tijuana Civil Protection Agency.  It was not immediately clear what caused the explosion.

Tijuana fire crews evacuated several people from the building and began rescue work. Authorities initially reported two people were believed to be trapped at the scene. After an hour and a half of work, firefighters were able to free one person who was trapped in the basement. The individual suffered first- and second-degree burns and was one of several transported to area hospitals, the agency said.  At least 25 people were injured, according to the Tijuana Fire Department — four with serious injuries, six in moderate condition and 15 with minor injuries. Rafael Cabillo, Tijuana's fire director, told Telemundo 20 that the search for other victims continues.  ""The houses that were in the upper part were already red-tagged and the upper part should not be inhabited,"" Bernardo Villegas, director of Tijuana Civil Protection, said in Spanish. ""I think that there was a repair of these houses and they rented them. All the people who were evacuated did not leave with injuries; [they] were outside the [explosion] area.""  The owner of the building, who did not want to provide his name to Telemundo 20, confirmed that another explosion occurred a few years ago in the same place.  ""The second location has an underground gas build-up. I can't tell you why; this is the second time this has happened to us. The disaster was four times bigger than [four] years ago,"" he said in Spanish.  The Secretary of Security and Citizen Protection, the fire department, the municipal police, Civil Protection, the Red Cross and seven private ambulances responded to the incident.  Around 10 a.m., Mayor Montserrat Caballero also arrived at the scene.  This is a developing story. Details may change as information is released."

The explosion, which occurred 8 billion light years away from Earth billions of years ago, has been erupting for three years without any signs of slowing down. Although scientists at first struggled to determine the cause of the cosmic blast, which they have named AT2021lwx, they now think the culprit is a supermassive black hole that came in contact with a gargantuan cloud of gas. That’s according to findings recently published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.  Stretching across a space that is 100 times the size of our solar system, the black hole formation is currently giving off 100 times more energy than the sun will emit over the course of its entire 10-billion-year lifetime.  The explosion itself is far from Earth, but its discovery could help scientists better understand black holes, which sit at the center of many galaxies, including our own.  “It really seems like, especially when they have time to do some more modeling, this will be an important step in understanding what’s happening in the middle of galaxies,” says Jonathan Blazek, a physics professor at Northeastern University.  Astronomers at the Zwicky Transient Facility in California originally discovered AT2021lwx in 2020 but struggled to suss out the exact cause of such a massive explosion. AT2021lwx was emitting too much light for too long to fit any known category of astronomical phenomenon, whether it was a supernova, aka an exploding star, or a tidal disruption, which occurs when a star has been pulled into a black hole and destroyed.  Eventually, NASA’s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, Chile’s New Technology Telescope and Spain’s Gran Telescopio Canarias were all brought online to aid in studying AT2021lwx. With all these telescopes pointed at AT2021lwx, astronomers eventually identified the black hole-related explanation they have settled on in their findings.  Blazek says the astrophysical qualities of a black hole definitely are primed to cause an explosion at this scale. Once a black hole gets large enough, it creates such a gravitational whirlpool that it starts sucking in anything that’s close to it, growing in the process. Anything that crosses the event horizon, the point of no return, and falls into the black hole is gone––it will never be seen or heard from again. That includes light.  So, how does a black hole cause an explosion with enough light to be seen billions of light years away by scientists on Earth?  “Because these are such big, extreme objects, you can have some pretty big, extreme things happening just outside the event horizon,” Blazek says.  The pull of a black hole is so strong that anything caught in its wake gets accelerated to the point where it’s moving near the speed of light, creating swirling, rapidly moving particles that are bumping into each other.  “You get really, really, really hot material outside the event horizon of the blackhole, and this really hot material can emit a lot of energy,” Blazek says. “It turns out the most efficient way to get energy out of mass is to drop it into a black hole.”  According to Blazek, there is a whole class of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) that are powered this way. Mass falls into a black hole, it gets shredded at high velocities and emits a ton of energy. But typically those kinds of events create a steadily increasing amount of energy and light that scientists can observe. That wasn’t the case here.  “They can find no evidence that this was active before, so their best theory is that this was a blackhole about a billion solar masses [large] that was just sitting there quietly because nothing was around to fall in,” he says. “Then, they think a big mass of gas got too close and pretty quickly got shredded and fell in.”  Blazek says this explosion has similarities to other cosmic phenomena, like AGNs, but it’s the differences that make the discovery so exciting.  Blazek says understanding more about the nature of black holes could help with his own work, which involves using galaxies and the movement of mass through the universe to map the cosmos. Black holes are instrumental in moving all kinds of matter through outer space. Although astronomers have learned a lot about black holes, there is still much that isn’t known about how supermassive black holes are created. By further studying an event like this cosmic explosion, scientists could unlock even more about these powerful cosmic forces and the nature of our galaxy as well.  “We don’t fully understand how these things grow, especially early on in their lives,” Blazek says. “If we see an event where a cloud of more than 1,000 solar masses is falling onto a black hole, in the sort of event we didn’t know could happen, that could be an important piece of this puzzle.”  Cody Mello-Klein is a Northeastern Global News reporter.

The explosive event labeled AT2021lwx was observed to be ten times brighter than any known supernova, the explosions that occur as massive stars die. And whereas supernova explosions only last a few months, this explosive event has been raging for at least three years.  AT2021lwx is also three times brighter than the light that is emitted as stars are ripped apart and devoured by supermassive black holes, occurrences called ""tidal disruption events"" or ""TDEs."" The blast is around 8 billion light-years from Earth and thus occurred when the universe was just 6 billion years old.  AT2021lwx was first spotted by the Zwicky Transient Facility in California in 2020 and was then picked up by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) based in Hawaii. Both of these systems are designed to survey the night sky for astronomical events that rapidly change in brightness over time, also known as ""transients."" This change in brightness can indicate a supernova or a gamma-ray burst (GRB) deep in the universe or something much closer to home like a comet or an asteroid.  Though it was spotted by these facilities three years ago, the sheer scale and power of the explosion AT2021lwx were unknown until now.  ""We came upon this by chance, as it was flagged by our search algorithm when we were searching for a type of supernova,"" University of Southampton research fellow Philip Wiseman, who led the research, said in an emailed statement. ""Most supernovae and TDEs only last for a couple of months before fading away. For something to be bright for two plus years was immediately very unusual.""  Wiseman and the team of astronomers think that AT2021lwx may be the result of a black hole violently disrupting a cloud of gas with a mass thousands of times greater than the sun. As it did so, the black hole swallowed fragments of the gas cloud, sending shockwaves into both what remains of the gas and into a wider donut-shaped torus of dust surrounding it, causing them to emit bright electromagnetic radiation.  Events like this have been witnessed before, they are rare. What's more, none that have been witnessed previously have been on the scale of AT2021lwx.  While AT2021lwx isn't actually as bright as the gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A spotted by astronomers in 2022, this event that erupted from 2.4 billion light-years away lasted for just ten hours after detection. Even though that is quite long for a GRB, it means that AT2021lwx has put out far more energy over its entire lifetime than this gamma-ray burst did in its own.  Measuring the power of a cosmic explosion  Following its initial discovery, the team of researchers behind this discovery continued to examine AT2021lwx using several different telescopes including the Neil Gehrels Swift Telescope, the New Technology Telescope in Chile, and the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, Spain.  Following these observations, the researchers took the spectrum of light that was emitted from the event and split it down into its constituent wavelengths, measuring how light was emitted and absorbed around the event. This allowed the researchers to calculate the distance to the source of AT2021lwx.  ""Once you know the distance to the object and how bright it appears to us, you can calculate the brightness of the object at its source,"" team member and University of Southampton professor Sebastian Hönig said in the statement. ""Once we'd performed those calculations, we realized this is extremely bright.""  The only thing in the known universe that is as bright as AT2021lwx are supermassive black holes. When these black holes feed on stellar gases that fall into them at high velocities, they can let off incredibly bright emissions known as quasars.  ""With a quasar, we see the brightness flickering up and down over time,"" team member and University of Southampton professor Mark Sullivan added. ""But looking back over a decade there was no detection of AT2021lwx, then suddenly it appears with the brightness of the brightest things in the universe, which is unprecedented.""  Though there are other possible explanations for the explosive event, the astronomers currently favor the explanation that sees an extremely large cloud of mostly gaseous hydrogen or dust that was knocked from its orbit around the black hole and sucked into it. This will only be conclusively determined when the team has collected more data about AT2021lwx.  The team will now look at the explosion in different wavelengths of light including X-rays. Doing so could reveal the temperature of the event and what processes are driving it. They will also conduct computer simulations to discover if their model of a titanic gas cloud disrupted by a black hole could account for AT2021lwx.  ""With new facilities, like the Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time, coming online in the next few years, we are hoping to discover more events like this and learn more about them,"" Wiseman concluded in the statement. ""It could be that these events, although extremely rare, are so energetic that they are key processes to how the centers of galaxies change over time.""

Then it was an outlandish suggestion. Much less so now.  Why? Things are exponentially worse. Trust is lacking. Solutions non-existent.  Increased anger over gun violence, immigration surges, abortion restrictions, financial corruption, inflation, homelessness, war, a pandemic, climate change, the dark web, and global rise of dictatorships, etc., has unleashed a rare form of political and social near-insanity that now infects the American body politic.

Pepe, a coin inspired by an anthropomorphized frog popular in internet memes, leapt nearly 7,000% in the 17 days after its April 16 launch, hitting a market value of $1.8 billion by May 5, according to data tracker CoinGecko.  Pepe’s rise has sparked renewed investor interest in memecoins as whole, with overall trading volumes jumping to $2.6 billion in the first week of May from $408,000 the week before, data from Dune Analytics data shows.  “Memecoins just flare up on occasion, and it’d historically happened when the market’s a bit choppy or sideways,” said Todd Groth, head of index research at CoinDesk Indices. “It’s almost like, if the market is not moving up fast enough, traders find these smaller tokens to trade with.”"

Although already quite difficult to overlook, Betelgeuse has become even more eye-catching across the past few years because of major changes in its appearance—unexpected fluctuations in its brightness that remain poorly understood. In recent weeks, the star has at times shone more than 50 percent brighter than normal, drawing renewed attention from amateur sky watchers and professional astronomers alike. These individuals hopefully await a historic celestial event. Someday, you see, Betelgeuse will explosively end its life in a supernova—and from our planetary perch just 650 light-years away, we Earthlings will have front-row seats to this spectacular cosmic cataclysm.

Stella on the Park, formerly known as Parkside Collective, is advertising apartments with leases starting as soon as June 1.  On the morning of Sept. 10, an explosion tore through the walls of a fourth-floor electrical room at the complex, raining debris onto the sidewalk outside and damaging adjacent apartments.  Aurora Fire Rescue investigators later ruled that the incident was the result of an underground electrical fire generating hydrogen gas, which vented into the utility room, where a spark of static electricity caused the gas to detonate.  The incident caused upheaval for hundreds of tenants, who were forced to evacuate and later told their leases were being canceled. Some apartments were subsequently burglarized before tenants had the chance to remove their belongings.  While repairs to the complex wrapped up this week, an attorney repr"

The batteries are used in everything from electric vehicles and bicycles to cellphones and computers. While rare, lithium-ion battery fires can be caused by a mechanical defect or being left in hot areas or direct sunlight, Moss said.

At first the tremors, which were registered on Saturday, were thought to have been caused by earthquakes.  Then, seismologists theorised that they originated from controlled explosions in Poland, almost 90 miles to the south, as part of military exercises.  But they are still not certain of the true origin of the unexplained geological phenomenon.  FILE PHOTO: Gas leak at Nord Stream 2 as seen from the Danish F-16 interceptor on Bornholm, Denmark September 27, 2022  On Monday, the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, an official body that monitors the underground, said the tremors were 'not caused by earthquakes, but by pressure waves from an event in the atmosphere.'  However, they came from 'an unknown source.'  'The seismologists can report that it is unlikely that the tremors originate from a controlled explosion in Poland, which was carried out shortly before the first reports of tremors on Bornholm,' the body known as GEUS said in a statement.  On Saturday, GEUS said it had received 'more than 60' tips from people on Bornholm that 'earthquake-like tremors' - described as a deep rumbling, shaking and rattling, changing pressure in the ear - had been reported in the afternoon on Bornholm.  This map, created shortly after the leaks in the Nord Stream pipeline were detected, shows the location of the Danish island of Bornholm  Police said they too were contacted by members of the public about the tremor on the eastern part of the island.  Danish media reported that the tremors caused a crack in the wall of a house, but no one was hurt.  GEUS said that seismic tremors were measured at a magnitude of 2.3.  Polish authorities have said that there was intensive activity during the Anakonda23 exercise in Ustka, northern Poland, involving jet fighters and live firing of artillery munitions.  GEUS, an independent research and advisory institution within Denmark's Ministry of Climate, Energy and Utilities, said that it had two seismographs on Bornholm that collect data around the clock.  Bornholm, home to nearly 40,000 people, is a rocky island in the Baltic Sea, south of Sweden, northeast of Germany and north of Poland."

Well, that’s not strictly true – to be more accurate, something truly gargantuan happened in space approximately 8 billion years ago, that we are only just finding out about now. Last Friday, scientists revealed the largest cosmic explosion ever witnessed: like a supernova, but more than 10 times brighter and more powerful than any other seen before. And its cause? A giant cloud of gas being sucked into a supermassive black hole.  If you want people to be excited about something, it’s important to come up with a catchy name. So, taking a leaf out of Elon Musk’s book of baby names, scientists called it AT2021lwx. But I’m gonna call her Sue. Sue Pernova. (You’re welcome.)  Sue had humble beginnings. She started out like the damp patch in the corner of your bathroom – small and barely noticeable, then over the course of time growing into something monstrous and without precedent. It was only when scientists established just how distant Sue was (8 billion lightyears) that they realised quite how much energy she must be burning to produce a light so bright.  01:17 ‘Absolutely gargantuan’: astrophysicist explains largest cosmic explosion ever witnessed – video  This is all well and good, I hear you cry, but why should I care? Sue seems great, but she lives miles away and besides I’m far too busy having to do the weekly shop, picking up the kids from school and Googling “black mould removal”. Well, I’ve been a space superfan since I was old enough to say “Houston we have a problem”, so you don’t have to convince me to care. But space can give us an insight into our existence.  There are certain aspects of space exploration that are easy to defend. Like the Dart mission last year which successfully tested technology designed to shift an asteroid off its course, protecting Earth and its inhabitants from a fatal collision. Most of us have a vested interest in the Earth not being smashed to smithereens, so it’s great to know that Nasa is on the case.  Some of the other stuff, though, is far more abstract and, for want of a better word, nerdy. But the truth is, every time something like this happens it puts another piece in the puzzle of understanding where we came from and where we will go.  We all know some basic things about the universe and our solar system from our school days: Jupiter has its raging stormy eye, Saturn has its rings, and Pluto has an identity crisis about its latest reclassification. But what you perhaps didn’t know, because they only found out recently, is that Saturn didn’t always have its rings.  A study from the University of Colorado suggests that the rings are only 400 million years old, with Saturn being nearer 4.5 billion years in age. Those figures are quite hard to get your head around, but if you scale that timeline down, it’s the equivalent of an 85-year-old bloke called Stanley deciding to grow a mo-hawk at 81. That’s a pretty wild and late-stage development, right? Certainly not something to define his whole existence by.  In the even blinkier-blink of an eye that is the period of human existence, we happen to have magically coincided with this beautiful phenomenon. Us being here now at the same time of Saturn’s rings is a delightful coincidence: a reminder that everything is fleeting, everything is changing, even in the universe.  Someone sent me a meme recently with a picture of the galaxy and an arrow pointing to a barely visible dot labelled “You, crying in the shower”. Apart from being very funny, it’s also very true (the crying bit, certainly). I find the underlying message of it weirdly profound. We are all so very small and the universe is so very big and almost all of our hopes, dreams and fears are entirely trivial.  If that doesn’t sound particularly comforting, stick with me. In 2009, Nasa released captures from the Hubble telescope showing the deepest image of the universe ever taken to date, allowing you to scroll in and out of hundreds of galaxies and solar systems that seemingly go on for ever. If you ever need a moment of profound perspective, that does it.  Cosmically speaking, if we are all insignificant, then everything we do is almost in defiance of that. It renders the choices we make simultaneously meaningless and also the most wonderful act of living; one more beautiful addition to an already improbable existence. That’s a pretty liberating thought. It’s all connected. Like it or not, we’re all part of a kind of celestial foxtrot: expanding, contracting, dying and being reborn.  So next time you hear about something happening a million miles away, think about how you’re a small part of that and how incredible it is to exist. Why not look out of your window tonight – maybe you’ll see the light from some supernova long since gone. And who knows, perhaps someone 8 billion lightyears away will be looking back from their damp, damp, bathroom, seeing the dead light from our sun and wondering about their own place in the universe."

Philadelphia 76ers coach Doc Rivers has been on the wrong end of plenty of dominant Game 7 performances, but Jayson Tatum’s explosion on Sunday night ranks right at the top, according to the man himself.  Tatum was simply unstoppable in the series-deciding matchup, putting up a mammoth 51 points on 17-28 shooting while also grabbing 13 boards and dishing out five assists en route to a 112-88 victory. James Harden faltered – again – and so too did Joel Embiid, but Tatum was the clear difference-maker throughout the course of the game.  In the wake of the defeat, Tatum’s performance was ranked by Rivers as one of the absolute best, saying that the only game which compares was LeBron James’ Game 6 effort against his Boston Celtics in 2012.

His Game 7 record of 6-10 will be the subject of plenty of discussion over the coming days, and rightly or wrongly, will no doubt have plenty of aggrieved Sixers fans politely suggesting their team finds a new coach.  Incidentally, after LeBron James’ historic performance in 2012, the Heat went on to win Game 7 and with it the series, before beating the Oklahoma City Thunder in five games to win the championship.

But a flurry of hard hit balls and two big innings from its senior leaders allowed it to crawl back and earn the decisive victory.  The Wolverines (26-22 overall, 13-8 Big Ten) prevailed on senior day behind the power of their bats to sweep Northwestern (8-38, 3-18) by a score of 15-5.  Coming off of a Big Ten Pitcher of the Week performance against Minnesota, senior left-hander Jacob Denner looked to stay hot on the mound. But, stymied early by the Wildcats’ offense, Michigan entered an early hole, giving up two runs quickly in the first inning.  With Denner unable to replicate his dominance from a week ago in the early innings, the Wolverines needed their bats to keep them in the game — and they delivered. In the bottom of the third inning the bats unleashed, as back-to-back doubles from graduate shortstop Cody Jefferis and senior second baseman Ted Burton drove in two RBI to bring Michigan within one run.  “I like a hot Teddy,” Michigan coach Tracy Smith said. “When he’s hot, he’s fun to watch. That’s what your older guys are supposed to do, is lead by example and through their play. He’s doing an excellent job of that.”  But the best was still to come for the Wolverines.  The next inning, senior third baseman Brandon Lawrence ignited a two-out onslaught with an RBI single, followed by home runs from Jefferis and Burton — Jefferis’ first homer of the season and Burton’s third in just this series. Michigan entered the bottom of the fourth down by one, but exited up by four.  After the early blows, the Wolverines used the crucial bottom of the fourth inning to retake all momentum, only needing to close out the rest of the game — and series.  Continuing that momentum, Denner’s pitching began to smooth, allowing just two more runs in the top of the seventh before handing off to senior right-hander John Torroella with a three run Michigan lead.  “Even with the hits, (Denner) didn’t give up much solid contact,” Smith said. “Following up his unbelievable performance from last week is what we’re gonna need him to do.”  While not equal to his career best performance last weekend, Denner still kept the Wolverines in position to hold their lead.  While the lead was safe at the time of Denner’s exit, it needed insurance. And that is where Jefferis re-enters the equation.  With the bases loaded in the bottom of the eighth inning, the senior roped a triple down the right field line. The hit scored all three runners, bolstering a six-run inning to close out a cycle performance at the plate for Jefferis.  “That really spread it open there,” Smith said. “Not only did it give him the cycle, but we were just saying, ‘Gosh, we need one more run just to kind of get away,’ … so the triple was big.”  He delivered the knockout shot. By piling on six runs in the seventh inning, Michigan had replicated and gone beyond what it did in its dominant fourth inning. The game was no longer in reach for Northwestern and the Wolverines achieved their lead on the backs of their seniors.  Earning the series sweep against the Wildcats is essential to Michigan’s hopes of another Big Ten Tournament run. And the final victory on Sunday shows that the Wolverines’ bats are heating up at just the right time."

Syracuse basketball 2024 four-star target Mikey Lewis is a scoring machine.  This past Friday through Sunday, the EYBL is holding its third spring session at the Southwest Athletic Center in Carrollton, Texas.  According to the EYBL Web site, on Friday evening, the Oakland Soldiers defeated the Detroit-based The Family, 79-67.  In 28 minutes, Lewis tallied 29 points, five rebounds and two assists. He connected on 9-of-16 from the field, 5-of-10 from beyond the arc and 6-of-6 from the free-throw line.  On Saturday morning, the Oakland Soldiers crushed the Miami-based Nightrydas Elite by a final count of 91-70. In this victory, Lewis recorded 26 points, three boards, one assist and three steals in only 20 minutes.  He hit on 8-of-14 from the field, 5-of-8 from downtown and 5-of-5 from the charity stripe.  In late April, when the EYBL held two sessions during live periods, Lewis produced scoring outbursts of 34 points, 22 points, 22 points, 23 points and 28 points, among others.  During the first live-period session last month, at the LakePoint Champions Center in Emerson, Ga., he led the EYBL in scoring at 25.3 points per contest.  This spring, through his first 10 games on the AAU circuit, Lewis is averaging 21.5 points, 4.5 rebounds, 2.5 assists and 28.1 minutes per game, while connecting on 46.1 percent from the field, 45.5 percent from 3-point land and 85.9 percent from the free-throw line. That’s impressive.  In his games on Saturday night and Sunday morning, Lewis scored 11 points and 6 points, respectively, over a combined 47 minutes. The Oakland Soldiers went 1-1 in these contests.

According to media reports, the ‘Cuse coaching staff was in attendance for Lewis during the live periods in late April.  Since getting an Orange offer, Lewis has said in at least two interviews that he wants to visit the Hill at some point in the future.  Besides Syracuse basketball, his growing offer sheet includes LSU, California, TCU, Providence, Arizona State, Colorado State, Illinois, Washington State, 2023 NCAA Tournament runner-up San Diego State and Wyoming, among others.  At this juncture, Rivals.com has Lewis at No. 69 overall in the 2024 class. The industry-generated 247Sports Composite places him at No. 124 nationally, No. 16 at point guard and No. 1 in Colorado.  The industry-generated On3 Industry Ranking puts Lewis at No. 138 nationwide, No. 14 at combo guard and No. 1 in Colorado.  I’m highly confident that, in the near future, Lewis will see his national rankings in the junior cycle soar."

Astronomers recently reported the observation of what appeared to be a large gas planet being eaten up by its aging star. The team said the sun-like star had been expanding for a very long time and finally got so big that it swallowed the nearby planet.  The researchers who made the observations said the star is in our Milky Way galaxy, about 12,000 light years from Earth. A light year is the distance light travels in a year – about 9.5 trillion kilometers. The findings were recently reported in a study published in Nature.  Most planets are believed to meet the end of their life when the star they are orbiting runs out of energy. This process causes the star to turn into a “red giant” that grows very large. The star can then swallow up the planet, and anything else that nears it.  The scientists say the planet’s destruction happened between 10,000 and 15,000 years ago near the Aquila constellation. At that time, the star was around 10 billion years old. The team said the swallowing event created a hot explosion of light, followed by a large release of dust that shot out into space.  Kishalay De is a researcher from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He discovered the light explosion by accident in 2020. He was examining data captured by the Palomar Observatory, based near San Diego, California.  De said he was surprised to observe a star that had suddenly increased in brightness by more than 100 times over a period of 10 days. He had been searching for binary star systems. These are sets of two stars that orbit around a common center of mass. When the larger of the stars takes bites out of the other, a bright explosion called an “outburst” happens.  But De said his examinations suggested the outburst was surrounded by cold gas, meaning it could not be a binary system. He learned from another space telescope that the star had also started releasing large amounts of dust months before the outburst.  While scientists had observed past star expansions, this was the first time they have been able to observe a complete planet-swallowing event.  The researchers said the collected data showed the swallowed planet was a “gas giant” with a similar mass to the planet Jupiter. They noted that the planet had become so close to its star that it could complete a full orbit in just one day.  The planet is believed to have “engulfed” the planet over a period of around 100 days, the team said. The bright explosion happened in the final 10 days as the planet was totally destroyed.  Miguel Montarges is an astronomer at the Paris Observatory who was not involved in the research. He told the French news agency AFP the star was thousands of degrees hotter than the planet when the destruction happened. He explained, ""It's like putting an ice cube into a boiling pot.""  Astronomers say the same event is expected to happen to other planets – including Mercury, Venus and Earth. De said our sun will likely reach its red giant period in about 5 billion years.  Astronomers do not know if more planets are circling the star at a safer distance. If so, De said they may have thousands of years before also getting swallowed up.  Now that they know what to look for, the researchers will be looking for more similar events. They believe thousands of planets around other stars will likely suffer the same fate as this one did.

Most of the improvisations have saved them money and helped to keep heads above water.  However, the new way of boycotting the high cost of cooking gas cylinders may cost lives than it can save money.  Economy&Lifestyle discovered that the cost of gas cylinders has risen so high that it becomes difficult for average homes to afford and still fill them with gas.  The situation becomes worse when considering that the pump price of kerosene, which would have been an alternative, is prohibitive.  Checks show that the price of cylinders varies according to the sizes. A 3kg gas cylinder costs N14,000, 5kg-N16,000 6kg – N17,000 and 12.5kg costs N19,000. Filling the cylinders with cooking gas also costs N2,600 for 3kg, N5,200 for 6kg, N8,950 for 10.5kg and N10,650 for 12.5 kg.  This means that an average home with a worn-out 5kg will need N20,250 to buy a new one and fill it, which is hard to come by.  So, the resolve is to refurbish the old ones and still manage them. However, that is where the danger is.  Mrs. Rukayat Adesoji, a trader, said her gas cylinder got rusted and no longer stands erect since last month, but due to high cost of purchasing the cylinders, she took it to a welder who patched the legs, repainted it, and since then, she has been using it.  “My gas cylinder which was 6kg got rusted and no longer stands erect since last month. When I asked for the price, I was told it was N17, 500. I was discussing it with a friend who advised me to take it to a welder to paint it and construct a new stand. I heeded to her advice and at the end spent just N3, 000 to turn my cooking gas to a brand new.”  Apart from refurbishing cylinders, some people don’t even know when their cylinders will expire. Mrs. Mercy Opara, a hair stylist, fell in that category as she explained: “I am taking my gas cylinder to the welder to spray it for me. It just cost N1, 500. The cost of buying a new cylinder is high. I have been using my cylinder for over 7 years and I don’t even know the expiry date. I just pray God blesses me so that I can buy a new one. But this one I am managing will look neat after spraying it for another two years.”  Mr. Adekanbi Joseph, a wielder, said he paints cylinder and “To paint and rebuild a cylinder stand, I charge N4, 500. Many people come here to paint as a new cylinder is now very expensive to get.”  Explaining the danger in using refurbished cylinders, The Chief Executive Officer, FKT Cooking gas and general goods, Mr. Benjamin Hope said: “A brand new cylinder can explode if the locks are not well keyed after using and if the cylinder filled with gas was moved from one place.  “There are many reasons for the high cost of gas cylinders in Nigeria. One is the cost of importation due to the exchange rate. Another is the increased migration from the use of kerosene to cooking gas which has necessitated increased demand for gas cylinders.  “You know that in such a case there will be increased importation of cylinders.”"

The 37-year-old Vanderpump Rules reality star put on a casual display in an off-white sweatshirt with the matching joggers as she headed out to run errands in Beverly Hills.  The bartender — who slammed Raquel Leviss in the explosive trailer for the season 10 reunion of the hit Bravo series — donned a pair of fluorescent neon yellow, fuzzy slippers.  For her outing, she threw up her platinum blonde tresses into a loose bun and sported a pair of cat-eye sunglasses.

The Vanderpump Rules reality star put on a casual display in an off-white sweatshirt with the matching joggers as she headed out to run errands in Beverly Hills  The model was also seen toting around a mini backpack in a gray leather fabric and gold hardware.  She donned a dazzling diamond statement ring on her hand with a stunning, long, and taupe manicure.  The cocktail book author opted for a makeup-free look to showcase her natural beauty.  Earlier last week, fans of Vanderpump Rules caught a sneak peek of the tense season ten three-part reunion.  In the trailer, Madix called out her now-ex, Tom Sandoval, 39, and slammed his mistress for being 'diabolical, demented, and subhuman'.  The former pageant queen, 28, had admitted that having an affair her close friend's boyfriend of nearly a decade was 'super selfish'.  In response, Madix quickly clapped back and said: 'Selfish does not cover it.'  For the rest of the trailer, Madix and the rest of the cast fired no shortage of insults at Sandoval and his mistress.

In the episode, James Kennedy, 31 — who was previously engaged to Leviss — also called Sandoval a 'backstabbing ho' for sleeping with his ex-fiancée.  After an explosive back-and-forth, Kennedy then fired back at Sandoval and called him 'a worm with a mustache' — which fans quickly took to social media to make into memes.  The first episode of the explosive reunion is set to premiere later this month on May 24."

He also co-hosts Cash Considerations: A Chicago Bulls Podcast for the Blue Wire Network.  Boston Celtics head coach Joe Mazzulla changed his starting lineup for Game 6 against the Philadelphia 76ers, inserting big man Robert Williams III and moving Derrick White to the bench. While the Celtics were on the ropes in the fourth quarter and needed both a late Jayson Tatum explosion and Sixers collapse to win, the move undoubtedly worked given Boston’s fast start to the game and Williams’ plus-18 in the box score. Because of this, it’s no surprise Mazzulla is sticking with this lineup for Sunday’s Game 7.  Mazzulla spoke to the media before the do-or-die game and confirmed he will keep the two-big starting lineup in place against Joel Embiid and Co., per ESPN’s Tim Bontemps. That means it will be Williams, Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart and Al Horford going up against Philly.  Williams played 28 minutes in Game 6, his highest playing time of the series. The big man was under 20 minutes in the prior three games and had played a high of 22 points in Game 2 before Game 6. He made his presence known with 10 points, nine rebounds and two blocks in those 28 minutes. And, again, the Celtics outscored the Sixers by 18 points when Williams was on the court.

It’s going to be a fascinating Game 7 with an Eastern Conference Finals date against the Miami Heat on the line."

The stunt was a response to an explosion in readily accessible AI tools. Last November’s launch of ChatGPT was, on the face of it, one of the most momentous technological advances in recent years. A text-based system, ChatGPT can write stories, college essays, job applications and so on in clear, fluent language and, if the user so chooses, in the style of Shakespeare, Donald Trump or Chaucer.  It clocked up over 100 million users in the first two months after launch, making it the fastest growing consumer application in history. And, less than four months after ChatGPT hit the headlines, OpenAI, the developer, launched GPT-4, the successor to GPT-3, the artificial intelligence system on which ChatGPT is based."
